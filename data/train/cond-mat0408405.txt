    "there is much interest in understanding how the out of equilibrium properties of glassy materials can be described within a statistical mechanics framework . at low temperatures ,",
    "the exceedingly long relaxation time prevents such materials from reaching thermal equilibrium on the accessible time scales , and makes hard to establish a connection with the thermodynamic phase behavior  @xcite .",
    "in particular , several questions about the nature of the glass state are still unanswered : for example , does it represent a genuine thermodynamic phase of the matter or a purely kinetic phenomenon ?",
    "how many `` fictive '' thermodynamic parameters are needed for characterizing the amorphous state ? these and other questions are relevant not only for glasses but for every system with slow dynamics  @xcite , such as dense granular materials and colloids , disordered dielectrics and electron glasses , etc .",
    "fifty years ago , kovacs designed an experiment in which the low temperature behavior of glasses is probed by means of the following protocol  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "a sample is brought from high to low temperature @xmath4 , and left to age for a time @xmath5 until its volume @xmath6 attains the value it would have in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the sample is then suddenly heated to @xmath9 and the ensuing volume relaxation is observed .",
    "even though the average volume is already at its equilibrium value , it turns out that in order to fully equilibrate , the system first increases its volume , then passes through a maximum that depends on the thermal history of the system , and eventually recovers the equilibrium .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior generally results from the superposition of two antagonist processes : the fast modes - equilibrated at @xmath4 , tend to increase the volume , while the slow modes - which are still relaxing towards @xmath4 , tend to decrease it  @xcite . the sample is therefore formed by regions having an average local density larger or smaller than the equilibrium one , which respond on different time scales to a change in temperature .",
    "the experiment thus provides an indirect evidence that the low temperature dynamics of glasses is spatially heterogeneous  @xcite .",
    "the kovacs effect was first observed in polymeric glasses  @xcite and in statistical mechanical systems as simple as the ferromagnetic ising chain  @xcite .",
    "there is an increasing interest in this phenomenon in connection with other kind of memory effects investigated in disordered magnets , and recent statistical mechanical approaches to glassy and granular matter . in these contexts",
    ", it has been observed that the kovacs effect occurs in systems with quasi - long range order  @xcite , spin glasses  @xcite , realistic model of molecular liquid ( ortho - terphenyl )  @xcite , traps models  @xcite , kinetically constrained spin chains  @xcite , and in simple models of granular compaction , such as the parking lot model  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the effect has also been studied in the spherical @xmath10-spin glass  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the kovacs effect in facilitated @xmath0-spin models of glassy dynamics in spatial dimension @xmath1 .",
    "our interest here is mainly dictated by the possibility of using the kovacs effect to identify the microscopic mechanism responsible for the slow relaxation ( e.g. , _",
    "strong _ vs. _ fragile _ glass behavior  @xcite ) , or , more ambitiously , to discriminate between situations in which an arrest transition occurs from others in which it does not .",
    "we also investigate the inherent structure dynamics during the kovacs protocol and show that models in spatial dimension @xmath2 and facilitation parameter @xmath3 are able to account for a subtle effect recently observed in molecular dynamics simulation of a realistic model of fragile glass forming liquid  @xcite .",
    "the model we consider is model first introduced by fredrickson and andersen  @xcite , with the purpose of describing the cooperative relaxation in highly viscous liquids .",
    "the spins are non interacting and the hamiltonian density is simply @xmath11 where the @xmath12 are spin variables , and the index @xmath13 runs over the sites of a lattice with coordination number @xmath14 .",
    "one possible interpretation of the spin variable is that its state represents , after a suitable coarse - graining over molecular length and time scales , mesoscopic regions of the liquid with more or less density .",
    "what makes the model non trivial is the dynamics , which is defined by the following facilitation rule : @xmath15 can flip with a non - zero rate if and only if at least @xmath0 of its @xmath14 neighboring spins are up , that is @xmath16 the transition rates satisfy detailed balance and are proportional to the metropolis factor @xmath17 \\ , ,      \\label{w_s}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the inverse temperature @xmath19 , and the heaviside function @xmath20 encodes the facilitation mechanism .",
    "it turns out that at low enough temperature the system dynamics is unable to relax to the equilibrium distribution within the simulation time window .",
    "in fact , as the density of up spins becomes smaller and smaller , the facilitation rule is hardly satisfied and consequently the spin relaxation becomes slower and slower .",
    "for this reason the model exhibits several glassy features , such as non - exponential relaxation , history dependent properties and heterogeneous distribution of local relaxation times  @xcite . for a review see refs .",
    "this type of facilitated spin model is reminiscent of the kinetically constrained lattice - gas introduced by kob and andersen  @xcite .",
    "however , the facilitated dynamics is not conserved and the constraint is weaker ( as it involves only the local field @xmath21 of the spin which attempts to flip ) .",
    "numerical investigations of two and three dimensional systems ( with different values of @xmath3 ) suggested that the characteristic equilibration time at low temperature diverges as a vogel - fulcher law  @xcite , although early arguments shown that the system is ergodic at any temperature larger than zero  @xcite . more generally , the equilibration time has a non - arrhenius behavior typical of fragile glasses for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the case @xmath22 instead corresponds to the defect diffusion dynamics and leads to the arrhenius behavior , @xmath23 , characterizing strong glasses .",
    "however , @xmath24 models , such as the east model  @xcite which have directed ( or asymmetric ) constraints , may also exhibit a non - arrhenius behavior .",
    "one reason of interest in the facilitated spin models is that they present many glassy features in spite of the absence of a true glass transition in finite dimension  @xcite , while on the bethe lattice they appear to have an ergodic / non - ergodic transitions of the kind predicted by mode - coupling theory  @xcite . in the following",

    "once the system leaves the initial is , two different behaviors are possible when one considers a couple of iss descending from configurations having the same energy before and after the peak .",
    "while in the simplest case the two iss may have the same energy there could be a more complicated case for which this is not true .",
    "the latter case has been observed recently by mossa and sciortino in molecular dynamics simulation of orto - terphenyl  @xcite , a typical fragile glass forming liquid .",

    "notice that in ref .",

    "our results show that the kovacs effect is qualitatively similar in all cases examined , irrespective of the spatial dimension the facilitation parameter , and the presence or not of a dynamic transition . however , in the class of facilitated models considered here one may distinguish between these situations by looking at temperature ( of the final quench , @xmath9 ) dependence of the kovacs peak time , which scales in the same way as the equilibrium relaxation time of the system at that temperature .",
    "thus , the kovacs protocol provides an independent way to gain information about the nature of the relaxation dynamics , at least for this class of models",
