    "tin sulphide ( sns ) is a semiconducting material formed from elements belonging to the iv - vi group of the periodic table .",
    "research on sns shows that it has potential use as holographic or optical data storage medium @xcite .",
    "also , due to its high absorption coefficient ( of the order @xmath1 ) and bandgap @xmath2 , sns films have been used as photovoltaic devices @xcite .",
    "sns exists in various crystallized states like orthorhombic @xcite , tetrahedral ( zinc blende like ) @xcite or a highly distorted rock - salt ( nacl ) structure @xcite . due to the nature of the tin and sulphur bondings , it forms two dimensional sheets @xcite , giving rise to a layered structure with strong intra - planar forces and weak van der waal forces between the adjacent planes @xcite .",
    "films of sns have been fabricated using various techniques such as thermal evaporation @xcite , rf sputtering @xcite , chemical vapour deposition @xcite , electrodeposition @xcite , spray pyrolysis @xcite and sulphurisation of metallic precursors @xcite .",
    "the optical properties of sns strongly depend on the deposition method used @xcite-@xcite . while a maximum band gap ( 1.78  ev ) was reported in films obtained by wet chemical method @xcite , the lowest band - gap ( 1.12  ev )",
    "was reported for films made by chemical bath deposition @xcite .",
    "the deposition techniques influences the film s grain size , crystal structure and residual strain which in turn effect the optical properties of the film . in light of the increasing importance of sns and its potential applications , it becomes important to study the film structure with its band - gap .",
    "thus , in this manuscript we report our studies on vacuum evaporated sns thin films that were vacuum annealed after fabrication and try to establish a relation between their structural and optical properties .",
    "sns films of varying thicknesses were fabricated by thermally evaporating powdered sns at vacuum better than @xmath3  torr in a hind high vac ( 12a4d ) thermal evaporation coating unit .",
    "the depositions were made on glass microscopy slides maintained at room temperature .",
    "sns powder of 99% purity supplied by himedia(mumbai ) was used as the starting material .",
    "the thickness of the asgrown films were measured by a veeco dektak surface profiler ( 150 ) .",
    "the samples were then subjected to post - annealing temperatures under vacuum for 30  mins at 373  k and 473  k. the structural , morphological , compositional and optical characterisations were done systematically for both the as grown and vacuum annealed films .",
    "we report and compare here the structural , morphological , compositional and optical properties of annealed samples of five different thicknesses , 270 , 480 , 600 , 650 and 900  nm .",
    "the stuctural analysis were done using bruker d8 diffractometer .",
    "the raman spectra of the films were obtained with renishaw invia raman microscope using argon laser beam in the reflection mode .",
    "the surface morphology of the samples and their chemical composition were examined with feg - sem jsm7600f and its energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) attachment .",
    "the optical properties of the samples were carried out using systronics uv - vis double beam spectrophotometer ( 2202 ) .",
    "the raman spectra were collected from back scattered @xmath4 laser .",
    "analysis of all our samples were done maintaining constant beam area , exposure time ( 30  sec ) and power ( 15  mw ) .",
    "all raman spectra were collected using low power laser since studies on sns as an optical data storage medium have shown changes induced in it by photo - thermal absorption of light .",
    "all the samples without exception showed three peaks , two prominent peaks around @xmath5 and @xmath6 and a third peak of lower intensity at @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8 peak is associated with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath6 raman peaks are associated with those of single crystal sns @xcite .",
    "our peak positions are slightly displaced from these positions .",
    "figure  ( 1 ) shows representative raman spectra of a 900 nm thick film , before annealing ( rt ) and after annealing at @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the relative contribution of the @xmath8 peak in annealed samples is lower as compared to that in as  grown samples .",
    "annealing , hence , removes @xmath9 bonding/ defects formed during film fabrication .",
    "the @xmath5 or the @xmath13 mode s peak corresponds to interaction along the inter - layer ` b ' axis , while the @xmath6 peak is the @xmath14 mode that corresponds to the symmetric sn - s bonding stretching mode in the a - c plane @xcite .",
    "it is clear from figure  ( 1 ) that the relative contributions from @xmath13 and @xmath14 do not change on annealing",
    ".    figure  ( 2 ) exhibits the x - ray diffractograms of thin annealed ( @xmath15 ) sns films of different thicknesses .",
    "three prominent peaks are seen at @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "these peak positions matched with those reported in astm card no .",
    "83 - 1758 .",
    "the sns in our samples hence exists with orthorhombic unit cell structure with the ( 040 ) peak having the maximum intensity .",
    "while there are many works in the literature that show ( 040 ) peak to be the most intense @xcite , others have reported ( 111 ) peak to be the most intense @xcite .",
    "this again underlines how growth technique and conditions influence the character of the sns films .",
    "the miller indices of the remaining prominent peaks are also indicated in the figure .",
    "the lattice parameters ` a ' , ` b ' and ` c ' of sns in single crystal state are given as 4.148 , 11.48 and 4.177   , respectively .",
    "we have evaluated the lattice parameters from the ( 040 ) , ( 200 ) and ( 131 ) peak s position using the relation @xmath19 the lattice parameters of the annealed samples were found to be @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "they were found to be different from those of sns in single crystal state .",
    "while the variation in ` a ' and ` b ' maybe be considered marginal ( decrease ) , there is a significant increase in ` c ' .",
    "albanesi et al @xcite have done systematic analyses to understand the effect of changing unit cell size on sns band - gap .",
    "their study suggests that an increase in volume of the unit cell would lead to a lowering in sns band - gap .",
    "we shall return to this when we discuss the results of our optical studies . while there is a significant change in the lattice constants ( namely ` c ' ) as compared to that of single crystal",
    ", we find that they do not change with film thickness or annealing temperature .",
    "figure  ( 3a ) shows all three lattice parameters remaining uneffected with film thickness .",
    "since points coincide , each point in this graph represents samples annealed at 373  k and 473  k. the difference in lattice constant present ( @xmath23 ) with respect to that given in the astm ( @xmath24 ) implies that the grains are in a state of stress with the peaks shifting left compared to those reported in the astm , we conclude tensile residual stresses are acting within the grains @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath23 is constant for all the samples hence the same tensile residual stress exists in all the samples .",
    "this tensile residual stress thus appears as a background in our study . while the lattice parameters remain unaltered , the grain size changes with annealing .",
    "the grain size reported were calculated using the full width at half maxima ( fwhm ) of the diffraction peaks in scherrer s formula @xcite . from figure  ( 3b ) , it is clear that there is a presistent increase in grain size with annealing , however this effect is more pronounced in thinner films .",
    "the grain size increases from 12  nm to 25  nm in the 270  nm films , while this increase in grain size with annealing temperature is impeded for thicker films ( fig  3b ) .",
    "sns is a layered compound with zig - zagged molecules of sns forming layers .",
    "these layers stack one on top of the other along the ` b ' axis with weak van  der  waal ` inter - planar ' forces acting between the layers .",
    "the layers themselves because of the zig - zagging have finite thickness and along the ` b ' axis have strong ` intra - planar ' forces acting within them .",
    "ehm @xcite has shown that the application of pressure decreases inter - planar distances along ` b ' axis without disturbing intra - planar spacing . as stated above",
    ", the raman @xmath13 peak represents vibrations along the ` b ' axis .",
    "fig  ( 4 ) shows the variation of raman peak position of annealed samples .",
    "while the @xmath25 peak remains fixed at @xmath26 , the @xmath13 peak shows a systematic shift to a higher wavenumber with increasing film thickness .",
    "it would appear thinner films with larger grain size have vibrations taking place at lower wave - number than thicker films with smaller grains .",
    "the raman peak s position and its fwhm is a rich source of information . while it does give information on the structure , the corroborative x - ray diffraction study showing no variation in lattice parameters imply variation in raman spectra is indicative of something else .",
    "literature on raman analysis have shown variation of fwhm to be a measure of phonon confinement @xcite with shift in peak position related to grain size @xcite-@xcite and nature of defect on the grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "a shift to higher wavenumbers is indicative of smaller grain size .",
    "hence , the results of x - ray diffraction and raman analysis , when put together , suggest that annealed sns thin films have large grains with grain size decreasing as the annealed film thickness increases .",
    "this is best understood from fig  ( 5 ) .",
    "the results shown in figure  ( 3b ) are also reflected in the scanning electron microscope s micrographs ( fig  6 ) .",
    "the film of 480  nm thickness showed significant increase in grain size and grain density when annealed at higher temperature as compared to the 900  nm thick film . comparing the 900  nm thick films annealed at 373  k and 473  k respectively , we do not find such improvement in grain size or density",
    "as was infered from the x - ray diffraction analysis .",
    "fig  ( 7 ) shows edx of 900  nm thick film annealed at 473  k. even after annealing at 473  k no oxidation is evident ( si and o is from glass substrate ) .",
    "this is evidently due to fact annealing was done in vacuum ( @xmath27  torr ) .",
    "based on the structural and morphological results , it would be interesting to study the optical properties of these samples .",
    "since the lattice parameters and residual tensile stress on the grain s bulk remains same with only grain size and to an extent grain density varying in the samples , the study should reveal the contribution that grain size have on the properties like band gap , @xmath0 .",
    "the optical absorption and transmittance spectra of all the samples were obtained in between wavelength range 300 - 900  nm .",
    "the absorption spectras were typical with absorption increasing near band - edge .",
    "tin sulphide is known to have both direct band - gap @xcite and indirect band - gap @xcite .",
    "the band - gap can be evaluated using the absorption coefficient ( @xmath28 ) obtained from the uv - visible spectra .",
    "the band - gap is obtained using the relation @xcite @xmath29 where ` n=1/2 ' for direct allowed transitions . on extending the best fit line on the linear part of the curve between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the point where the line cuts the ` x - axis '",
    "gives the energy band - gap of the sample . using this method ,",
    "we have evaluated band - gaps for all the samples . as discussed earlier",
    ", the lattice parameters remained unchanged for annealed films , hence it can be conclusively said that the bandgap variation is not caused by the lattice defects .",
    "the bandgap of sns films strongly depends on the depostition process and the film parameters like the film thickness .",
    "sns amorphous film of thickness 1000  nm grown on a glass substrate by spray pyrolysis has a bandgap of 1  ev @xcite . while films grown by vacuum evaporation were found to be nano - crystalline with bandgap varying between 1.15 - 1.3  ev .",
    "the variation in bandgap was found to be related to the distance between the source and the substrate @xcite .",
    "films grown on ito substrates by pulsed electrodeposition were polycrsytalline in nature with bandgap being 1.34  ev @xcite .",
    "polycrystalline films grown by chemical bath deposition on glass substrates of 290  nm thickness also possess low bandgap ( 1.15  ev ) @xcite . while the films grown with rf sputtering technique are also nano - crystalline , they have very high bandgaps varying from 1.3 to 1.7  ev @xcite",
    ". a recent study @xcite on sns polycrystalline thin films grown by thermal evaporation reports sns band - gap between 2.15 - 2.28  ev .",
    "clearly , polycrystalline sns films have higher band - gaps compared to their amorphous counterparts .    figure  ( 8) shows the grain size dependence of the bandgap",
    ". the bandgap decreases with the increasing grain size .",
    "table  1 summarizes the findings of this study .",
    "it shows on annealing , thinner films have larger grains .",
    "the large grain size gives the annealed samples a lower band - gap .",
    "thicker films however , have smaller grains and an enhanced band - gap .",
    "the bandgap of a sample is broadly effected by its chemical composition , crystal structure , grain size and defects . of all these contributing parameters , except for grain size , all other parameters remain constant .",
    "while the larger volume of the unit cell leads to a background low @xmath0 ( @xmath32 ) as explained by albanesi @xcite , decreasing grain size contribute to an increase in @xmath0 of the vacuum annealed sns samples .",
    "the band - gap s variation with grain size due to quantum confinement has the quantitative form @xcite @xmath33 where ` r ' is the radius of the nanoparticle and ` m ' the effective mass of the system . the solid line of fig  ( 8) shows good fit of eqn([eeg ] ) to our experimental data points .",
    "the result again reiterates influence of both the lattice parameters ( via @xmath34 ) and grain size on the band - gap of sns .",
    "thin films of sns were fabricated by thermal evaporation on microscopy glass slides at room temperature .",
    "these films when annealed in vacuum at 373  k and 473  k developed a tensile strain along the lattice ` ac ' plane .",
    "the magnitude of this tensile strain was independent of the film thickness and annealing temperature .",
    "however , the film thickness and annealing temperature play an important influence on the samples grain size .",
    "we conclude from our results that @xmath0 of nano - crystalline sns films invariably depends on the grain size due to quantum confinement .",
