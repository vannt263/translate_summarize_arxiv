    "from the early example of hh 30 @xcite , the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) has enabled dramatic advances in the study of edge - on circumstellar disks associated with young stellar objects ( ysos ) . in this favorable geometry ,",
    "the distribution of light scattered by the disk allows good estimates of several disk properties that are not easily discernible from the modeling of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) alone @xcite .",
    "edge - on systems are especially valuable at the protostellar stage when an envelope is present , since the disk , envelope , and bipolar envelope cavities can appear as distinct features , making it easier to disentangle their contributions to the scattered - light emission .",
    "some investigators , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , have modeled images and multiwavelength photometry of edge - on protostellar systems in the relatively nearby taurus - auriga region ( at a distance of 140 pc ; @xcite ) to determine their disk , envelope , and cavity properties .    here",
    "we bring the superb angular resolution of _ hst _ to an edge - on source in the more distant orion star - forming region , taken to be at 420 pc based on high - precision parallax studies of non - thermal sources in the orion nebula region @xcite .",
    "the source was discovered in a _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "survey of the orion a and b molecular clouds @xcite . at @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( j2000 ) ,",
    "it is an isolated object in the lynds 1641 ( l 1641 ) region of orion a @xcite .",
    "a search of the literature reveals no previous imaging studies of the object , although it is source 1224 in the study of @xcite , who analyzed its 2mass and _ spitzer _ magnitudes in a study of over 1000 ysos in l 1641 .",
    "we refer to it here as hops 136 , its number in the target catalog for hops , the _ herschel _ orion protostar survey @xcite .",
    "hops was a 200-hour open - time key program with the _ herschel space observatory _",
    "@xcite to obtain imaging , photometry , and spectroscopy of orion protostars between 55 and 210  , where their seds are expected to peak , with pacs , the photodetector array camera and spectrometer @xcite .",
    "in addition to the _ herschel _ data , hops features imaging and spectroscopy from near - infrared to millimeter wavelengths .",
    "imaging of hops 136 with the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) on board _ hst _ revealed bipolar nebulosity divided by a dark lane , confirming its edge - on orientation .",
    "here we model the 1.2  to 1200  sed and near - ir images of the source with the radiative transfer code of @xcite .",
    "combined image and sed modeling breaks degeneracies common in the modeling of seds alone , in particular that a system with a tenuous envelope seen through an edge - on disk can have a similar sed to a system with a dense envelope seen closer to pole - on @xcite or to a transition disk with an inner hole @xcite .",
    "based on our modeling , we find a low - mass protostellar envelope ( 0.06 @xmath1 ) , a large , low - mass disk ( radius 450 au , mass 0.002 @xmath1 ) , and a small amount of cavity material ( @xmath2 per cavity ) for the source .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :   section 2 discusses the target selection and the acquisition of multiwavelength imaging , photometry , and spectra , section 3 presents an initial characterization of the source , section 4 describes the model and inferred disk , envelope , and cavity properties , section 5 contains discussion , and section 6 , our conclusions .",
    "in 2008 august and september , we acquired images of 72 objects in the hops catalog at 1.60 and 2.05  with nicmos . extended nebulosity and previously unknown companions are frequently detected ( m.  kounkel et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "five of the 72 sources have bipolar nebulosity divided by a dark lane , indicating an edge - on geometry . from among these",
    ", we chose hops 136 for detailed modeling due to the full availability of photometry from 1.2  to 1200  and its almost exactly edge - on orientation ( section 3 ) .",
    "the combined 1.60  and 2.05  images of hops 136 appear in figure  [ f.nicmos ] .",
    "the full set of images from the nicmos survey and its extension with wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) will be presented by j.  booker et al .  in a future publication .",
    "below , we provide details of the _ hst _ imaging , multiwavelength photometry , and _ spitzer _",
    "table  [ t.photometry ] contains the photometry for hops 136 , and figure  [ f.sed ] shows its sed .",
    "we used nicmos to map a field containing hops 136 on 2008 august 22 .",
    "we used the nic2 camera , which has @xmath5 pixels at 0.075  on a side for a 19.2  field of view , about 8000  au at the distance of orion .",
    "the spatial resolution is about 80  au .",
    "the source was imaged with the f160w ( 1.60 ) and the f205w ( 2.05  ) filters .",
    "in addition to the pipeline processing , we subtracted a median - combined image of a blank field to remove a spatially variable glow from the detector and telescope as well as variable offsets among the four detector quadrants .",
    "we obtained photometry at @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) , which observed hops 136 on 1998 march 30 .",
    "the source is flagged as extended , so we report fluxes within a circular aperture of radius 5  as given in the extended source catalog .",
    "we also obtained photometry at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22  from the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ ; @xcite ) , which observed the source on 2010 march 910 .",
    "photometry at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , and 24  for hops 136 was obtained as part of a joint survey of the orion a and b molecular clouds by the infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) and multiband imaging photometer ( mips ; @xcite ) on board _",
    "spitzer_. a detailed accounting of the _ spitzer _ observations , data reduction , and source extraction can be found in @xcite and @xcite ; here we summarize the most important details .",
    "the irac observations of l 1641 were taken as part of guaranteed time observation program 43 and were obtained in two epochs , one on 2004 february 1719 and the other on 2004 october 8 and 27 .",
    "irac photometry was obtained at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  using an aperture of radius 2.4  with a sky annulus extending from 2.4  to 7.2  and corrected to infinity by dividing by aperture corrections :  0.824 , 0.810 , 0.725 , and 0.631 in order of increasing wavelength .",
    "photometric zero points and zero - magnitude fluxes for the irac bands can be found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",

    "for photometry , the _ herschel _ data were processed with the high - pass filtering method described by @xcite and discussed in detail by @xcite , using version 8.0 , build 248 of hipe , the _ herschel _ interactive processing environment @xcite .",
    "hops 136 is unresolved at both pacs wavelengths .",

    ", we also include a 100  measurement from the _ herschel _ gould belt survey @xcite . from the _ herschel _ science archive , we obtained two orthogonal scans of a region containing hops 136 ( observation ids 1342218553 and 1342218554 ) , and we reduced them with the same high - pass filtering method we used for the 70 and 160  data .",
    "we obtained aperture photometry for hops 136 using a 9.6  radius with subtraction of the median signal in a background annulus extending from 9.6  to 19.2 , the same as at 70 , and we divided by an aperture correction of 0.694 , again accounting for removal of some of the point - spread function by sky subtraction .",

    "a dust continuum map of the hops 136 region at 1.2  mm was obtained in 1999 february with the 37 channel mambo bolometer array at the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "the data were reduced with standard procedures for bolometers as described in @xcite . at this wavelength ,",
    "hops 136 was undetected , and we present an upper limit .",
    "we observed hops 136 ( target 8469384 - 7093 ; aor key 20856320 ) on 2007 april 16 with the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observations were made with the two low - spectral - resolution irs modules ( short - low from 5.2 to 14.5  and long - low from 14.0 to 38.0 ; @xmath14 ) in staring mode .",
    "the spectrum was generated from the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) s18.7 pipeline basic calibrated data with the irs instrument team s smart software package @xcite . to prepare the data for extraction , we first replaced the permanently bad and `` rogue '' pixels flux values with those interpolated from neighboring functional pixels .",
    "for the short - low module and the first order of the long - low module , sky emission was removed by subtracting the extracted profiles of off - nod or off - order data .",
    "the sky emission in the second and third orders of the long - low module was removed by subtracting a degree - zero polynomial that was fit to the emission profiles .",
    "the spectra were extracted with the advanced optimal extraction method ( adopt ; @xcite ) .",
    "we then used adopt again to extract the spectra of three spectral calibrators : markarian 231 , @xmath15 lac , and @xmath16 dra .",
    "template spectra of these three calibrators were divided by their extracted spectra at the two nod positions to create relative spectral response functions ( rsrfs ) .",
    "we then multiplied the extracted orders of hops 136 at both nod positions by the rsrfs .",
    "the resulting nod - position spectra were averaged to obtain the final spectrum , and the spectral uncertainties are estimated to be half the difference between the two independent spectra from each nod position .",
    "here we present some initial characterization of hops 136 before applying radiative transfer modeling .",
    "figure  [ f.nicmos ] shows how the elements of a protostar except for the central source are all visible in scattered - light imaging of an edge - on system , with the dark disk midplane , bright upper disk layers , disk shadow , envelope , and cavities all denoted .",
    "the near - ir morphology confirms an edge - on line of sight , and the brightness ratio of the two sides of the nebula is sensitive to the exact inclination @xcite . to avoid complications from the complex envelope morphology , we measured the brightness in two boxes that allow a comparison of the upper and lower halves of the disk .",
    "the boxes have widths of 31 pixels ( 980 au ) and extend above or below the central dark lane with heights of 8 pixels ( 250 au ) .",
    "the top box is 19% brighter than the bottom box at 1.60  and 4% brighter than the bottom box at 2.05 . in the model adopted below",
    ", a system even 1@xmath17 from edge - on has 24% more flux in the upper box at 1.60  and 22% more flux at 2.05 .",
    "while inclination is not the only factor that influences the brightness ratio , this finding suggests that the inclination of hops 136 is greater than @xmath18 . in the modeling",
    "below , we fix the inclination at @xmath19 .",
    "we treat the sed as static due to the lack of significant variability in mid - ir photometry and spectra acquired in 2004 , 2005 , 2007 , and 2010 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity and temperature derived from a protostellar sed characterize its evolutionary state @xcite . for hops 136 , the bolometric luminosity @xmath20 , found by trapezoidal integration of the sed and assuming a distance of 420 pc to the orion region , is 0.83 @xmath0 .",
    "the bolometric temperature @xmath21 , the temperature of a blackbody with the same mean frequency as the sed , is 174  k. this places hops 136 squarely in the observational category class i , with @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "class i is believed to correspond , generally , to the evolutionary category stage i @xcite , where the envelope material is in the process of falling onto a circumstellar disk but the stellar mass exceeds the remaining envelope mass .",
    "the ratio of submillimeter to bolometric luminosity , @xmath23 , where the apex data are used to calculate @xmath24 , is 0.8% .",
    "this is greater than the 0.5% upper limit for class i sources @xcite , implying a less evolved envelope , but in section 5.3 we conclude that this is due to the edge - on inclination of the source rather than an atypically dense envelope for stage i. ( the 1.2 mm mambo limit was ignored in these calculations , but treating it otherwise affects the results at a level far below the quoted precision . )    analyzing the slope of the sed over various wavelength intervals , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is defined as the flux density at wavelength @xmath27 , we find @xmath28 , typical of the flat - sed sources @xcite",
    ". these can be modeled as young stellar objects with envelopes @xcite .",
    "@xcite drew the same conclusion about hops 136 ( their object 1224 ) from @xmath29 . in the system developed by @xcite for irs spectra , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which would classify hops 136 as a transition disk , a post - protostellar object in which the protoplanetary disk has an inner hole . due to the deep local minimum centered near 10  but affecting fluxes across the _ spitzer _ range",
    ", it is necessary to compare the near - infared to the far - infrared to find the rising sed typical of class i sources .",
    "we find @xmath32 for hops 136 , consistent with its class i status .",
    "the source is in an isolated environment , with minimal nebular background and only three 70  point sources , all at least ten times fainter , detected within @xmath33 projected au .",
    "further , hops 136 does not appear to be driving a jet .",
    "while the cavities visible in the nicmos images suggest outflow at some level , there are no affiliated herbig - haro objects , there are no outflow lines in its _",
    "spectrum , and an outflow is only marginally detected in a co @xmath34 map of this region ( j.  di francesco , priv .",
    "this source provides an opportunity to study the formation of an isolated protostar , allowing a comparison to standard models .",
    "the nicmos images do show a faint point source 6.6  ( projected separation 2800 au ) to the southwest of the protostar ( fig .  [ f.nicmos ] ) .",
    "this source , undetected by 2mass , has nicmos magnitudes @xmath35 in f160w and @xmath36 in f205w .",
    "while this is likely a background star , if it is a physical companion , its magnitudes are consistent with those of an early l dwarf behind @xmath37 mag of extinction , according to the bt - settl models for an age of 1 myr @xcite .",
    "the scattered - light nebulosity is less extended in this direction , raising the possibility that the faint source influences the morphology of the hops 136 envelope .",
    "to gain a more precise understanding of the hops 136 envelope , disk , and central star , we used the monte carlo radiative transfer code of @xcite to fit the source sed and images .",
    "the code features a central star and flared disk , which emit photons that can then be scattered or absorbed and re - emitted by dust in either the disk or an envelope .",
    "the envelope density is defined by the rotating collapse solution of @xcite plus a bipolar cavity that can contain dust and gas with a power - law density distribution .",
    "we first attempted to fit the sed of hops 136 with the @xcite online tool , which finds the best match to an input sed in a pre - computed grid of over 20,000 whitney et al .",
    "models observed at 10 viewing angles @xcite .",
    "of the ten best - fit seds , three have viewing angles @xmath38 , consistent with the edge - on morphology of the nicmos images .",
    "these seds match the 1.21200  photometry except for a mild underprediction of the flux near the 10  minimum in the irs spectrum .",
    "however , the near - ir peak in all of these models is due to direct stellar flux , not scattered light . in these models , the view toward the protostar skims the upper edge of the disk , allowing the near - ir flux of the central star to escape to the observer with little attenuation .",
    "since the robitaille grid does not include images , we generated our own with the parameters of the best - fit seds .",
    "these images contain a bright point source at the center of the system , not the dark dust lane observed toward hops 136 .",
    "no model in the robitaille grid fits both the sed and the image well .    for subsequent fitting",
    ", we used the version of the whitney et al .",
    "code with release date 2008 april 7 . for the disk , envelope , and cavity dust",
    ", we use a model from @xcite for a 2:1 mixture of ice - coated silicates and bare graphite grains , where the depth of the ice coating is 10% of the particle radius .",
    "the particles are subjected to time - dependent coagulation ; we choose a time of 0.3 myr .",
    "the particle size distribution at this time ranges from @xmath39 to 3  with the number at each size roughly proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "the opacity and scattering laws for the ensemble are density - weighted averages of laws for particles of different sizes .",
    "we assume a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 .",
    "the adopted model is shown in black in fig .",
    "[ f.dust ] .",
    "we favor this model because it contains both scattering and absorption properties across the full range of wavelengths required by the radiative transfer code , its mid - ir properties resemble those determined by @xcite for star - forming regions ( blue curve in fig .",
    "[ f.dust ] ; this is also what we use to add foreground reddening to the model ) and those used by @xcite for modeling an edge - on protostar , and its mid - to - far - ir opacities resemble those of the frequently cited oh5 opacities ( @xcite ; red dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ f.dust ] ) .",
    "the adjustable input parameters in the whitney et al .",
    "code were initially set to those of the `` class i '' model from @xcite , which are typical values for low - mass protostars , and the inclination was set to @xmath19 due to the morphology of the nicmos images .",
    "this model yields a double - peaked sed , with a near - to - mid - infrared peak consisting of stellar and accretion - generated photons that have been scattered by the disk and envelope and a far - infrared peak consisting of photons from the same initial sources that have been reprocessed to long wavelengths by cold disk and envelope dust .",
    "it also yields an image with two roughly parabolic nebulae separated by a dark lane .",
    "the sed is most sensitive to the total luminosity @xmath41 , which controls the overall flux in the sed , and the envelope density , parameterized here by the reference density @xmath42 , the density at 1 au in the limit of no rotation , which controls the wavelength and flux of the far - infrared peak @xcite .",
    "these are not set explicitly in the whitney et al .",
    "code but are functions of the infall and accretion rates and the stellar parameters .    the luminosity is the sum of the stellar luminosity @xmath43 and the accretion luminosity @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath44 is a function of the stellar mass @xmath46 , the stellar radius @xmath47 , the inner radius of the dust disk @xmath48 , the inner radius of the gas disk @xmath49 , and the rate at which matter accretes from the disk onto the star @xmath50 .",
    "since reprocessing by the disk and envelope erases the distinction between luminosity from the central source and luminosity due to accretion , we simplify the fitting by fixing the stellar luminosity at 1 @xmath0 and adjusting the total luminosity only via the disk - to - star accretion rate .    the envelope density is proportional to @xmath51 , the rate at which matter falls from the envelope onto the disk . for the adopted density profile",
    ", @xcite showed that the reference density @xmath42 can be written as @xmath52 as the density increases , the far - ir flux first increases and then shifts to longer wavelengths .",
    "the first step in fitting was to coarsely adjust @xmath41 and @xmath42 to get an approximate match to the observed sed .        to fit the images , we compared the height and width of the contours at 1 , 10 , and 35% of the peak emission in the model to those in the observations .",
    "these contours track the width and depth of the dark lane , the extent of the adjacent bright concentrations of scattered light , and the morphology of the envelope structure on a scale of @xmath53  au , respectively . since our code is axisymmetric , we do not attempt to reproduce even fainter emission at larger scales , which is irregular in hops 136 and protostars in general @xcite .",
    "after obtaining coarse fits to the sed and images by adjusting @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we built grids of models to cover small ranges of parameters around the coarsely determined values .",
    "we ranked the sed models with the @xmath54 statistic ( @xcite ; e.  furlan et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this statistic measures the logarithmic deviation of the observed sed from the models in units of the fractional uncertainty , where @xmath55/n.\\ ] ] here @xmath56 is the number of data points , @xmath57 is the observed flux at each wavelength @xmath27 , @xmath58 is the model flux at each wavelength @xmath27 , and @xmath59 is the inverse of the approximate fractional uncertainty in each data point , taken to be 5% at wavelengths less than 350 , 40% at 350 , and 20% at 870 .",
    "models that violate the 1200  upper limit were discarded .",
    "each model can be shifted slightly in luminosity and modified with foreground reddening under the law of @xcite to improve the fit ( section 4.1 ) .",
    "the models with @xmath60 are qualitatively good fits , and we chose the one in this range that provides the best match to the image contours ; it has @xmath61 .",
    "we compare the preferred model sed to the photometry and spectrum in figure  [ f.sed ] , and we compare the model images to the nicmos images in figure  [ f.model ] . to get adequate signal in the image and the millimeter - wavelength portion of the sed , @xmath62 photons were run through the monte carlo code .",
    "the code generates output for multiple apertures ; the plotted sed shows the result from the 5  aperture in the 2mass regime and the 20  aperture ( which captures the entire simulation box ) at longer wavelengths , with an interpolation scheme to bridge the change of aperture .",
    "counting all the flux in the simulation box is a good approximation to the observed non-2mass fluxes , which are either measured in small apertures and corrected to a total flux via aperture corrections or determined by fitting a point - spread function .",

    "[ s.source ] , the inclination appears to be nearly edge - on , @xmath105 .    for an edge - on protostar ,",
    "the intrinsic luminosity is generally larger than the observed luminosity due to extinction by the disk and by foreground dust .",
    "in contrast to the observed luminosity of 0.8 @xmath0 , the best - fit model has an intrinsic luminosity near 5 @xmath0 when all viewing angles are accounted for . to optimize the luminosity and extinction , we assume that for small differences in luminosity , seds differ by only a multiplicative constant .",
    "this is reasonable given the finding of @xcite that the wavelength of the peak flux from an optically thick envelope scales as the luminosity to only the @xmath106 power .",
    "we then write the observed sed @xmath107 as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a model sed , @xmath110 is a small multiplicative constant that allows the luminosity to differ slightly from that of the best - fit model , @xmath111 is the foreground extinction in magnitudes as a function of wavelength , @xmath84 is the extinction in the @xmath85 band , and the extinction law is @xmath112 .",

    "the mass - opacity product is constrained rather than the mass alone , since the mass density and the opacity per unit mass appear as a product in the scattering equations .",
    "we quote a disk mass of @xmath64 @xmath1 for hops 136 with the understanding that it can be compared most directly to modeling done with similar opacity laws ; we have chosen dust properties similar to widely used tabulations . with a larger disk mass ,",
    "the central lane in the image is too dark , as measured by the separation of the contours at 35% of maximum brightness , and the 10  minimum in the sed is too deep .",
    "the opposite problems arise for smaller disk masses .    the scale height at large radius controls the morphology of the bright nebulae just above and below the dark lane , which we track with the image contours at 10% of maximum flux .",
    "we quote a scale height at 100 au of @xmath66 au .",
    "a larger scale height makes the 10% contours too high and the dark lane too wide ; the opposite problems arise for a smaller scale height .",
    "@xcite caution that the radius corresponding to the edge of the scattered light from the disk is merely a lower limit to the disk radius . from this approach",
    ", we find a disk radius of @xmath68 au .",
    "while this may be a lower limit , we note that it is already larger than most known protostellar disks .",
    "we discuss this in further detail in section  [ s.discussdisk ] .",
    "as discussed above , the sed and images respond to the overall envelope density , which can be quantified in various ways .",
    "we quote a reference density ( eqn .",
    "[ e.rho1 ] ) of @xmath119  g  @xmath69 for comparison with literature studies but note that densities as large as @xmath42 do not actually occur anywhere in the envelope . to give a sense of a typical envelope density , @xmath120 , the density at 1000 au in the limit of no rotation ( e.  furlan et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , is @xmath72  g  @xmath69 for hops 136 .",
    "larger envelope densities are ruled out because they yield a far - ir sed peak that is too red and near - ir images in which too little scattered light escapes the envelope .",
    "smaller envelope densities are ruled out because they yield a far - ir sed peak that is too weak and near - ir images in which the contours of the scattered light at 1% of maximum emission are too concentrated toward the disk .",
    "we assume the centrifugal radius @xmath96 , where the dependence of the density on the stellocentric radius @xmath121 transitions from @xmath122 when @xmath123 to @xmath124 when @xmath125 , is the same as the disk outer radius .    given the @xcite density law , our best - fit envelope falls to a density typical of the larger molecular cloud , @xmath126 molecules @xmath69 , at @xmath127 10,000 au .",
    "we adopt this as the outer radius of the envelope .",
    "accounting for the reference envelope density @xmath42 , the centrifugal radius @xmath96 , and the cavity parameters described below , we calculate an envelope mass inside a 10,000 au radius of @xmath74 @xmath1 .      in figure  [ f.nicmos ] ,",
    "the northern cavity is better defined than the southern one .",
    "we measured the apparent ( half ) opening angle of the cavity at 2000 au above the dark lane to be 21@xmath17 .",
    "the cavity shape near its base is curved , suggestive of a parabola . a parabolic cavity with an opening angle of 21@xmath17 at 2000 au corresponds to a 10@xmath17 opening angle at the 10,000 au envelope radius .",
    "we thus quote an opening angle of @xmath128 for the cavity and an opening exponent of @xmath78 .    an unusual aspect of the hops 136 sed ( fig .",
    "[ f.sed ] ) is the redness of the short - wavelength peak ( near 2.2  ) and the relatively small ratio of the long - wavelength peak to the short - wavelength peak , 5.5 in @xmath129 space . for comparison , in the sed generated by adopting the reference class i parameters from @xcite and using the dust opacities described above , the short - wavelength peak is at only 1.7  and the ratio of the long - wavelength peak flux to the short - wavelength peak flux is 15 .",
    "these unusual characteristics of the hops 136 sed can be replicated by adding material to the envelope cavities .",
    "this is parameterized by setting the density at @xmath47 to @xmath102 g @xmath69 , diminishing with radius to the @xmath100 power . in the model",
    ", no dust exists inside the sublimation radius ( @xmath130 ) , so the largest density encountered in the cavity is @xmath131 g @xmath69 .",
    "the total mass in each cavity is @xmath132 , and the optical depth at 2.2  through the cavity along the polar axis is @xmath133 . along the cavity wall",
    ", the cavity is always much less dense than the adjacent disk or envelope , consistent with cavity dust of a reasonably low mass and density .",
    "this cavity dust shifts the near - ir peak to the requisite longer wavelength and larger relative flux .",
    "working from the center of the system outward , we discuss the central star , the disk , and the envelope and cavity of hops 136 .      without a measurement of keplerian rotation ,",
    "the properties of the central source are uncertain in a protostellar system .",
    "the weak flux in the optical and near - ir and the veiling of photospheric lines in these regions by accretion processes prevent spectral typing . sed modeling alone is not useful , as one can not distinguish between the intrinsic luminosity of the central star and the luminosity due to accretion , and , in our adopted model for the envelope density , the envelope infall rate and the mass of the star are degenerate .",
    "nonetheless , we can combine the results of sed fitting with envelope and stellar evolution models to estimate a plausible mass for the central source . averaged over a long period , the envelope infall rate for hops 136 is unlikely to be greater than @xmath134 @xmath92 , as this would deplete the modeled envelope mass of 0.06 @xmath1 in less than @xmath135 yr .",
    "the current disk accretion rate is also unlikely to be significantly larger than this , as hops 136 shows no evidence of the well studied accretion outbursts in young stellar objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "first , the estimated maximum envelope infall rate and modeled envelope density place a rough upper limit on the mass of the central object .",
    "equation  [ e.rho1 ] shows that , for a known envelope density , the envelope infall rate scales as the square root of the central mass .",
    "an overly massive central star would cause the envelope to fall in implausibly quickly . substituting our finding of @xmath136  g  @xmath69 and our estimate of @xmath137 @xmath92 into equation [ e.rho1 ]",
    ", we find @xmath138 .",
    "the total modeled luminosity of 4.7 @xmath0 is also indicative of a low - mass star .",
    "second , the estimated maximum disk accretion rate and total modeled luminosity place a rough lower limit on the mass of the central object .",
    "the total modeled luminosity is the sum of stellar luminosity @xmath43 ( due to contraction toward the main sequence ) and accretion luminosity @xmath44 .",
    "( this neglects luminosity due to external heating , but this is expected to be insignificant in an isolated source such as hops 136 . ) essentially , our estimate of a low disk accretion rate suggests a relatively small accretion luminosity and a relatively large stellar luminosity , ruling out the least massive stars .    the total luminosity is @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the fraction of the potential energy that is radiated away , and @xmath141 is the gravitational constant . in accreting young stars ,",
    "@xmath140 is commonly assumed to be 0.8 due to the truncation of the accretion disk at a few stellar radii by the stellar magnetic field @xcite , a value we adopt here . rearranging and substituting , @xmath142    further rearranging terms , replacing @xmath41 and @xmath140 with our favored values , and using solar units , we find @xmath143 this condition",
    "can be compared to models of pre - main - sequence stars , since the small remaining envelope mass suggests the main accretion phase is over .",
    "although the model age to assign to hops 136 is a source of ambiguity , inspection of the @xcite models for small ages reveals that the left - hand side of this condition generally increases with @xmath46 , exceeding the right - hand side at about 0.4 @xmath1 for a model age of @xmath144 yr after the end of the main accretion phase .",
    "we thus adopt a lower stellar mass limit of @xmath145 @xmath1 . with the upper limit of 0.5  @xmath1 from equation  [ e.rho1 ] , we estimate that hops  136 contains a star of @xmath146 @xmath1 .",
    "this is typical of low - mass protostars but substantially in excess of the 0.06  @xmath1 remaining in the envelope .",
    "0.5 in      the mass and radius of the hops 136 disk can be compared to those of large samples of disks from class 0 to class ii .",

    "@xcite observed 20 class 0 and i protostars between 850  and 1.3 mm .",
    "@xcite imaged ten class i objects in taurus at 1.3 mm , detecting eight single sources and one binary , and modeled these images in concert with 0.9  images and broadband seds from the literature .",
    "( table  [ t.masses ] excludes the binary . )",
    "@xcite took an approach similar to ours , modeling the 0.55 to 1300  seds and near - to - mid - ir images of eight class i objects in taurus . focusing on later stages",

    "its mass is below the median mass of the @xcite class ii disks , in the 40th percentile .",
    "its envelope mass is small for class i , but its ratio of envelope mass to disk mass , 30 , is large compared to the median ratios of the @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite embedded samples .    the radius of the disk , 450 au , is large for disks at any stage .",
    "it exceeds the median radius for the @xcite sample and is equal to those of its two largest disks .",
    "it is also larger than those of all objects in the @xcite sample except the `` butterfly star '' iras 04302 + 2247 , a similarly edge - on protostar with a disk radius of 500 au . in the catalog of circumstellar disks ,",
    "hops 136 is in the 80th percentile of the class i radius distribution and the 90th percentile of the class ii distribution .    to summarize , the mass of the hops 136 disk is typical of class ii objects , but consistent with its classification as a class i protostar , there is a substantial reservoir of mass remaining in its envelope .",
    "its radius is large ( but not unprecedented ) for either a class i or a class ii system , suggesting that the infalling envelope may have imparted a large amount of angular momentum to the disk .",
    "it appears to be an example of a system in transition from the protostellar stage to the t tauri stage .",
    "we showed in section  [ s.source ] how , from its near- and mid - ir photometry and spectrum alone , one might draw alternative conclusions about the evolutionary state of hops 136 . the slope of the sed across the _ spitzer_/irac range and the @xmath85 to 24  slope both indicate that hops 136 is a flat - sed source .",
    "the _ spitzer_/irs classification scheme of @xcite identifies hops 136 as a transition disk .",
    "the seds of edge - on protostars and face - on transition disks are similar in that both have mid - ir deficits . in transition disks , optically thick material with the requisite temperatures for mid - ir emission is not present , while in edge - on protostars , this material is hidden from view by the cold outer regions of the disk",
    ".    with far - ir photometry and hst imaging , hops 136 is revealed to retain a protostellar envelope .",
    "it has @xmath32 , making it a class i source , and the imaging shows light scattered by the inner envelope . calculating @xmath147 for the best - fit model to hops 136 ( as opposed to the observed photometry ) has the advantage that we can estimate the dependence of this quantity on inclination angle .",
    "the near - to - far - ir slope of the model sed is consistent with class i sources ( @xmath148 ) when the inclination is closer to edge - on than @xmath149 and consistent with flat - sed sources ( @xmath150 ) when the inclination is closer to pole - on than @xmath149 .",
    "this is evidence that flat - sed and some class i sources may be objects in a similar evolutionary state viewed from different angles .",
    "the inclination dependence of @xmath23 is also a clue to the evolutionary state of hops 136 .",
    "the observed ratio is 0.8% , which indicates a dense class 0 envelope under the original @xcite definition .",
    "however , this ratio is enhanced by the edge - on inclination . as the inclination of the best - fit model varies from edge - on to pole - on",
    ", @xmath24 increases by only 7% , but @xmath20 increases by nearly 700% .",
    "this is because the disk attenuation that so strongly affects the edge - on sed predominantly reduces the fluxes at wavelengths less than 160  .",
    "thus , @xmath23 is greater than the @xcite class  i upper limit of 0.5% only for inclination angles greater than about @xmath151 , again pointing to a protostellar envelope in the later stages of evolution .      simultaneously fitting the sed and near - ir images of hops 136 requires a small amount of dust and gas in the cavity .",
    "while @xcite set a constant cavity density of @xmath152 g @xmath69 in their class  i model , which would correspond to @xmath153 of material in each of the adopted hops 136 cavities , this low density has an undetectable effect on our model sed and images .",
    "our prescription for the cavity density adds negligible mass ( @xmath154 per cavity ) ; rather , the improved sed fit is due to the concentration of cavity material near the disk plane .",
    "the density averaged over the inner 1 au of each cavity is @xmath155 g @xmath69 , three orders of magnitude larger than the constant density of @xcite and comparable to the constant cavity density used by @xcite to model the butterfly star .",
    "( this is the only one of the eight embedded objects modeled by @xcite that requires cavity dust of sufficient density to affect the sed , which weakly constrains the frequency of this phenomenon . )",
    "our @xmath156 density law yields the desired behavior in the sed without requiring a substantial increase in the cavity mass .",
    "@xcite showed how , in massive stars , a disk wind in the style of @xcite or an x - wind in the style of @xcite could carry disk dust into an outflow cavity .",
    "the same process may be at work in hops 136 .",
    "in _ spitzer _ and _ hubble _ images of the l  1641 region in the orion a molecular cloud , we discovered an isolated edge - on protostar and designated it hops 136 in the target catalog for the _ herschel _ orion protostar survey . in nicmos 1.60 and 2.05  images ,",
    "the object is almost exactly edge - on and shows all of the hallmark features of an embedded protostar :  a dark dust lane and bright scattered light from the disk , diffuse scattered light from an infalling envelope interrupted by a disk shadow , and bipolar cavities presumably evacuated by past outflow .",
    "we used the @xcite radiative transfer code to model the _ hst _ images and the @xmath157  sed of the source , which combines photometry and spectra from 2mass , _ wise _ , _ spitzer _ , _ herschel _ , apex , and iram . from the modeling , we conclude that the protostar is of moderate luminosity ( @xmath158 ) and envelope mass ( 0.06  @xmath1 inside 10,000 au ) .",
    "its disk has mass 0.002 @xmath1 and radius 450 au , and there is @xmath154 of material in each envelope cavity concentrated near the disk plane .",
    "with pre - main sequence models , we estimate a central source mass between 0.4 and 0.5 @xmath1 .    by the observational diagnostics @xmath21 and @xmath147 ,",
    "hops 136 is a class i source . with modeling , we find the envelope mass to be much less than the stellar mass but not zero , confirming that it is approaching the end of envelope infall .",
    "its disk mass , however , is less than the median for t tauri stars , and from most inclination angles , hops 136 is expected to resemble a flat - sed source .",
