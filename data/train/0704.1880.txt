    "suppose that an extended quantum system in @xmath0 dimensions ( for example a quantum spin system ) , is prepared at time @xmath3 in a pure state @xmath4 which is the ground state of some hamiltonian @xmath5 ( or , more generally , in a thermal state at a temperature less than the mass gap to the first excited state ) .",
    "for times @xmath6 the system evolves _ unitarily _ according to the dynamics given by a _ different _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath7 , which may be related to @xmath5 by varying a parameter such as an external field .",
    "this variation , or quench , is supposed to be carried out over a time scale much less than the inverse mass gap .",
    "how does the state @xmath8 evolve ?",
    "for a finite number of degrees of freedom , the system generically shows a periodic ( or quasiperiodic ) behavior with a period that typically increases when the number of degrees of freedom grows .",
    "this is the well - known phenomenon of _ quantum recurrence__. however , in the thermodynamic limit this is no longer necessarily the case , and the natural question arises as to whether the system ( or , rather , a macroscopically large subsystem ) reaches a stationary state for very large times . to attack this question we consider the simpler question of how the correlation functions , expectation values of products of local observables , evolve and whether they reach constant values for large times . _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this problem has its own theoretical interest , being a first step towards the understanding of equilibration in quantum systems . on the same fundamental level we can also ask whether the approach can provide a new tool for the characterization of the collective excitations in strongly correlated systems .",
    "however , until recently it has been considered a largely academic question , because the time scales over which most condensed matter systems can evolve coherently without coupling to the local environment are far too short , and the effects of dissipation and noise are inescapable .",
    "recent developments of experimental tools for studying the behavior of ultra - cold atoms have revised completely this negative attitude .",
    "in fact , thanks to the phenomenon of feshbach resonance it is possible to tune the coupling of an interacting system to essentially any value and in extremely short times .",
    "in addition , the coupling to dissipative degrees of freedom can be much weaker than in ordinary condensed matter systems .",
    "this has allowed the observation , among other things , of the collapse and revival of a bose - einstein condensate @xcite and of the quenching of a spinor condensate @xcite .",
    "furthermore , using highly anisotropic optical lattices , it has been possible to build and study essentially one - dimensional systems @xcite , and , of direct interest for this paper , the coherent non - equilibrium dynamics of these integrable models has been measured @xcite .",
    "( other interesting experiments are considered in refs .",
    "these striking experimental results have largely motivated the development of new numerical methods to study non - equilibrium dynamics , the most successful one being the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite .    on the purely theoretical side these kind of questions",
    "were first considered ( as far as we are aware ) in the seventies in the context of the quantum ising - xy model in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite for recent developments ) .",
    "however , in the very last few years , after the previously mentioned experimental progress , the study of quantum quenches has been pursued in a systematic manner and a large number of results is nowadays available . to quote only a few examples ,",
    "the models considered include several realizations of one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose gases @xcite , luttinger liquids @xcite , coupled 1d condensates @xcite , strongly correlated 1d fermions @xcite , and mean field fermion condensates @xcite .",
    "a closely related topic , that will not be considered here , concerns the formation of defects when crossing a critical point with changing the external parameter at a fixed rate , i.e. the so - called quantum kibble - zurek mechanism @xcite .",
    "most of these papers concern the exact or approximate solutions of very specific models .",
    "these are often strongly relevant , since in many cases they can be directly compared with existing experimental results or give very accurate predictions for future investigations .",
    "however , from the study of specific models it is difficult to draw general conclusions on the physics of quantum quenches .",
    "there have been at least two notable exceptions . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was conjectured that the asymptotic state at very large times can be described by a generalized gibbs ensemble ( for more details we refer the reader to section [ phint ] where this conjecture will be explicitly discussed in relation to some of our findings ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied the time evolution after a quench in general , exploiting the path integral approach and the well - known mapping of the quantum problem to a classical one in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "the translational invariance in the ( imaginary ) time direction is explicitly broken and thus the initial state plays the role of a boundary condition .",
    "this limits the range of applicability of field - theoretical methods , but when the hamiltonian @xmath7 is at or close to a quantum critical point we could use the renormalization group ( rg ) theory of boundary critical behavior ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . from this point of view , particularly powerful analytic results are available for @xmath2 because then the @xmath9-dimensional problem is described asymptotically by a boundary conformal field theory ( bcft)@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold : on the one hand we give a detailed description of the methods and the results reported briefly in ref .",
    "@xcite , and on the other we generalize these results and give some new physical insights .",
    "several results , in fact , appear here for the first time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secpath ] we introduce the path - integral formalism that is applied in the following section [ seccft ] to one - dimensional critical systems by means of cft . in sec .",
    "[ secint ] we consider two simple 1d models whose non - equilibrium dynamics is exactly solvable to check the correctness of the previous results and to extend our findings to gapped and lattice systems . in sec .",
    "[ hd ] we generalize the method to higher dimensions . in the last section [ phint ]",
    "we analyze all our results and explain most of the general findings in quantum quenches by means of simple physical arguments .",
    "we broadly discuss some open questions and possible future developments .",
    "let us consider a lattice quantum theory in @xmath0 space dimensions .",
    "the lattice spacing is @xmath10 , and the lattice variables are labelled by a discrete vector variable @xmath11 .",
    "time is considered to be continuous .",
    "the dynamics of the theory is described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "suppose we prepare this system in a state @xmath4 that is not an eigenstate of @xmath7 and unitarily evolve it according to @xmath7 .",
    "the expectation value of a local operator @xmath12 at time @xmath13 is ( t,\\ { * r*_i})= _ 0 | e^i h t o(\\ { * r*_i})e^-i h t|_0 .",
    "we modify this time - dependent expectation value as ( t,\\ { * r*_i})= z^-1 _ 0 | e^i h t - h o(\\ { * r*_i } ) e^-i h t - h| _ 0 , [ oexp ] where we have included damping factors @xmath14 in such a way as to make the path integral representation of the expectation value absolutely convergent .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath15 ensures that the expectation value of the identity is one . at the end of the calculation we shall set @xmath16 to zero .",
    "( [ oexp ] ) may be represented by an analytically continued path integral in imaginary time over the field variables @xmath17 , with initial and final values weighted by the matrix elements with @xmath4 : @xmath18\\langle\\psi_0|\\phi(\\tau_2,{\\bf r})\\rangle \\langle\\phi(\\tau_1,{\\bf r})|\\psi_0\\rangle\\,e^{-\\int_{\\tau_1}^{\\tau_2}l[\\phi]d\\tau}\\ ] ] where @xmath19d\\tau$ ] is the ( euclidean ) action . the operator @xmath20 is inserted at @xmath21 , and the width of the slab is @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 should be considered as real numbers during the calculation , and only at the end should they be continued to their effective values @xmath25 . in this way we have reduced the real - time non - equilibrium evolution of a @xmath0 dimensional systems to the thermodynamics of a @xmath1 field theory in a slab geometry with the initial state @xmath4 playing the role of boundary condition at both the borders of the slab .",
    "the validity of our results relies on the technical assumption that the leading asymptotic behavior given by field theory , which applies to the euclidean region ( large imaginary times ) , may simply be analytically continued to find the behavior at large real time .",
    "( [ oexp ] ) can be in principle used to describe the time evolution in any theory and for all possible initial conditions .",
    "unfortunately , in confined geometries only a few field theories with very specific boundary conditions can be solved analytically in such a way to have results that can be continued from real to complex values .",
    "some examples of these will be given in sec .",
    "( an interesting case concerns integrable massive boundary field theories as for example the recent application to the dynamics of coupled 1d condensates in ref . @xcite . )",
    "however , the treatment greatly simplifies if a system is at or close to a ( quantum ) phase transition .",
    "in fact , in this case , we can use the powerful tools of renormalization group ( rg ) theory of boundary critical phenomena ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in the case of a scalar order parameter ( corresponding to the ising universality class ) , the slab geometry of above is usually described by the action @xcite s()=d^d r _ _ 1^_2 d ( ( ) ^2 + ^2+^4)+ d^d r c[(=_1,r)+(=_2,r ) ] , [ lgh ] where @xmath26 measures the distance from criticality , @xmath27 ensures the stability in the broken - symmetry phase , and @xmath28 denotes the surface enhancement , i.e. the difference of the interactions on the surface with respect to the bulk .",
    "the value of @xmath28 depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "for example , the choice @xmath29 forces the field to vanish on the boundary , thus corresponding to dirichlet boundary conditions . on the other hand @xmath30 forces the field to diverge at the boundary .",
    "finite values of @xmath28 correspond to intermediate boundary conditions . according to the rg theory ,",
    "the different boundary universality classes are characterized by the fixed point of @xmath28 .",
    "a complete rg analysis ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) shows that the possible fixed points of @xmath28 are @xmath31 , with @xmath32 stable and @xmath33 unstable .",
    "any other value of @xmath28 flows under rg transformations to @xmath34 .",
    "these universality classes are called ordinary ( @xmath35 ) , special ( @xmath33 ) , and extraordinary ( @xmath36 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , for the purpose of extracting the asymptotic behavior , as long as @xmath4 is translationally invariant , we may replace it by the appropriate rg - invariant boundary state @xmath37 to which it flows .",
    "the difference may be taken into account , to leading order , by assuming that the rg - invariant boundary conditions are not imposed at @xmath38 and @xmath24 but at @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the language of boundary critical behavior",
    ", @xmath41 is called the extrapolation length @xcite .",
    "it characterizes the rg distance of the actual boundary state from the rg - invariant one .",
    "it is always necessary because scale - invariant boundary states are not in fact normalizable@xcite .",
    "it is expected to be of the order of the typical time - scale of the dynamics near the ground state of @xmath5 , that is the inverse gap @xmath42 .",
    "( this can be checked explicitly for a free field theory , see later ) .",
    "the effect of introducing @xmath41 is simply to replace @xmath16 by @xmath43 .",
    "the limit @xmath44 can now safely be taken , so the width of the slab is then taken to be @xmath45 . for simplicity in the calculations , in",
    "the following we will consider the equivalent slab geometry between @xmath21 and @xmath46 with the operator @xmath20 inserted at @xmath47 .",

    "let us discuss to what initial conditions the fixed points correspond . in the case of free boundary conditions ,",

    "the correlation functions are accessible through the powerful tools of boundary cft .",

    "it vanishes if @xmath71 corresponds to an operator whose expectation value in @xmath4 vanishes , and thus @xmath73 , for all times .    when the primary field is not vanishing on the boundary , performing the conformal mapping ( [ logmap ] ) we obtain ( w)_strip= |w(z)|^-x ( z(w))_uhp= a^_b ^x [ phistrip ] that continued to real time @xmath74 gives ( t)= a^_b ^x a^_b ( ) ^x e^-xt/20 .",
    "[ onepoint ] thus the order parameter ( and any other observables described by a primary field ) decays exponentially in time to the ground - state value , with a non - universal relaxation time @xmath75 .",
    "the ratio of the relaxation times of two different observables equals the inverse of the ratio of their scaling dimensions and it is then _",

    "all the correlation functions calculated so far display two very general features : first there is a sharp horizon ( or light - cone ) effect at @xmath104 ( or @xmath88 ) resulting in a behavior before and after @xmath94 completely different ; second the asymptotic long - time correlation functions are the same as those at finite temperature @xmath143 . the light - cone effect is a very general phenomenon and and will be discussed in section [ phint ] . in the following sections we will point out that also the `` effective temperature '' is a general phenomenon , but it has some specific cft features that are worthy of comment .",
    "in fact , it is very easy to understand the _ technical _ reason why we find an effective temperature despite the fact that we are studying a pure state at @xmath144 .",
    "the finite temperature correlations can be calculated by studying the field theory on a cylinder of circumference @xmath145 . in cft",
    "a cylinder can be obtained by mapping the complex plane with the logarithmic transformation @xmath146 .",
    "the form for the two - point function in the slab depends in general on the function @xmath96 cf .",
    "( [ deff]) but when we analytically continue and take the limit of large real time , we find that effectively the points are far from the boundary , i.e. at @xmath147 .",
    "thus we get the same result as we would get if we conformally transformed from the full plane to a cylinder , and from eq .",
    "( [ logmap ] ) the effective temperature is @xmath148 .",
    "a similar argument can be worked out for the multi - point functions as well . _ _    an addtional comment concerns what we expect for correlation functions of general operators , not only primary .",
    "we have clearly seen that the local energy density does not relax , of course , and this is consistent with its not being primary .",
    "but , we also know that at finite temperature @xmath149 , that is perfectly compatible with the previous result with @xmath143 .",
    "furthermore , for large real times , the two - point function of @xmath150 does behave as though it was at finite temperature .",
    "this means , in particular , that the energy fluctuations in a large but finite volume ( the specific heat ) are the same as those at finite temperature .",
    "thus one is tempted to extend this finite temperature interpretation to non - primary operators , and indeed it is the case .",
    "in fact , in the argument of above for the equivalence of the long - time correlations and finite @xmath151 , there are essentially three steps .",
    "first , we need to write down the form of the correlation function in the half - plane , but this only depends on special conformal transformation and so is valid for any quasi - primary operator like @xmath80 .",
    "second we have to transform from the slab to the half - plane : for non - primary operators this can have some anomalous term . finally we need to compare the large limit of this to what one would get transforming directly from the cylinder to the full plane .",
    "however , the two conformal transformations we are comparing are both logarithmic ( in one case @xmath152 , in the other case @xmath153 ) , so the anomalous terms should be the same .",
    "thus the two correlations functions are the same .",
    "this argument works for all quasi - primary operators .",
    "then , since we can get all the non - quasiprimaries by considering successive operator product expansions with the stress tensor , it also works for all operators .",
    "the results of the previous section rely on the technical assumption that the leading asymptotic behavior given by cft , which applies to the euclidean region ( large imaginary times ) , may simply be analytically continued to find the behavior at large real time . while such procedures have been shown to give the correct behavior for the time - dependent correlations in equilibrium , it is important to check them in specific solvable cases for non - equilibrium evolution .",
    "thus , as a complement to the cft calculations , in this section we consider the _ real - time _ evolution of two simple analytically tractable models .",
    "we solve the dynamics of a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators and we review and re - analyze some known results for the ising - xy chain in a transverse magnetic field . beyond providing examples of the cft results ( with central charge @xmath154 and @xmath155 respectively ) in the critical case ,",
    "these models allow us to take into account the effects of a finite mass - gap and of the lattice . _",
    "_      the simplest model with an exactly solvable non - equilibrium dynamics is surely a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators with hamiltonian h=12_r .",
    "[ hchaingen ] we introduce a coupling more general than simple nearest - neighbor hopping so as to allow for a general dispersion relation below . for simplicity",
    "we also assume periodic boundary conditions . @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the position and the momentum operators of the @xmath158-th oscillator , with equal time commuting relations = i_nm=[_n,_m]=0 .    the hamiltonian can be written in diagonal form @xmath159 with modes a_k & = & ( _ k _ k+i _ k ) , + a_k^&=&(_k _ -k - i _",
    "k^2&=&m^2 + 2_j_j(1-(2kj / n ) ) .",

    "in this paper we studied in general the non - equilibrium unitary dynamics that follows a sudden quantum quench .",
    "we showed that if the hamiltonian @xmath7 governing the time evolution is at a critical point , while @xmath5 ( i.e. the one for @xmath165 ) is not , the expectation value of a class of operators ( primary ones in cft ) relaxes to the ground - state value exponentially in time with universal ratio of decaying constants .",
    "we also found that connected two - point functions of operators at distance @xmath88 are vanishing for @xmath318 , while for @xmath320 reach exponentially fast a value that depends _ exponentially _ on the separation , in contrast with the power laws typical of equilibrium configuration . _ _",
    "we also considered the real - time dynamics of simple exactly solvable models and we found that several of the typical characteristics of the critical points still hold . roughly speaking , critical points are not special as far as quenching dynamics is concerned . in fact , also for gapped systems , connected correlation functions vanish ( or are strongly suppressed ) for @xmath318 and for asymptotic large times resemble those at finite temperature despite the fact that the whole system is in a pure state .",
    "several other examples in the recent literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) gives further evidence that these two effects are actually true in general , at least in the realm of exactly solvable models considered so far .    in the following",
    "we give a simple interpretation of these two features separately trying to understanding their physical origin .",
    "the qualitative , and many of the quantitative , features found for the time evolution of correlation functions may be understood physically on the basis of a picture we first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the time evolution of the entanglement entropy .",
    "later we generalized it to correlation functions in ref . @xcite and it has been largely adopted thereafter @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that such scheme is not an ab initio calculation but rather a simplified picture which allows us to explain physically our findings .",
    "the initial state @xmath4 has an ( extensively ) high energy relative to the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath7 which governs the subsequent time evolution , and therefore acts as a source of quasiparticle excitations .",
    "those quasi - particles originating from closely separated points ( roughly within the correlation length @xmath325 of the ground state of @xmath5 ) are quantum entangled and particles emitted from far different points are incoherent .",
    "if the quasiparticle dispersion relation is @xmath326 , the classical velocity is @xmath327 .",
    "we assume that there is a maximum allowed speed @xmath328 .",
    "a quasiparticle of momentum @xmath329 produced at @xmath11 is therefore at @xmath330 at time @xmath13 , ignoring scattering effects .",
    "this is the only physical assumption of the argument .",
    "scattering effects are not present in the theories considered so far , but as evident from the argument outlined below they can play a role for only @xmath226 ( allowing , perhaps , for a renormalization of @xmath227 by the interactions ) .",
    "these _ free _ quasi - particles have two distinct effects .",
    "firstly , incoherent quasi - particles arriving a given point @xmath331 from well - separated sources cause relaxation of ( most ) local observables at @xmath331 towards their ground state expectation values .",
    "( an exception is the local energy density which of course is conserved . )",
    "secondly , entangled quasi - particles arriving at the same time @xmath13 at points with separation @xmath332 induce quantum correlations between local observables . in the case where they travel at a unique speed @xmath333 ( as in cft ) , therefore , there is a sharp `` horizon '' or light - cone effect : the connected correlations do not change from their initial values until time @xmath334 . in the cft case",
    "this horizon effect is rounded off in a ( calculable ) manner over the region @xmath335 , since quasi - particles remain entangled over this distance scale .",
    "after this they rapidly saturate to _ time - independent _ values . for large separations",
    "( but still @xmath336 ) , these decay _ exponentially _ @xmath337 .",
    "thus , while the generic one - point functions relax to their ground - state values ( we recall in cft this relaxation is exponential @xmath338 ) , the correlation functions do not , because , at quantum criticality , these would have a power law dependence .",
    "of course , this is to be expected since the mean energy is much higher than that of the ground state , and it does not relax . _ _ _ _ _ _    this simple argument also explains why for the case of a semi - infinite chain the relevant time scale is @xmath339 rather than @xmath340 , since one of the two particles arriving in @xmath88 has been reflected from the end of the chain .",
    "this has been also stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the study of the time dependence of entanglement entropy of finite chains with open boundary conditions .",
    "all our results are consistent with this picture as long as the quasi - particles are assumed to all propagate at the same speed , resulting from a `` conformal '' dispersion relation @xmath341 appropriate to the wave number @xmath329 . in this case",
    "the horizon effect first occurs at time @xmath342 , where @xmath227 is the maximum group velocity .",
    "if @xmath227 occurs at a non - zero wave number , it gives rise to spatial oscillations in the correlation function .",
    "thus again connected correlation function are expected to be strongly suppressed for @xmath266 and start developing only after @xmath94 . in the case of a general dispersion relation",
    "we do not have a proof , beyond the stationary phase approximation , that the connected correlation functions remain constant up to this time , but one would expect it on the grounds of causality .",
    "( the proof in the case of a relativistic dispersion relation uses lorentz invariance in an essential way . ) however , because there are also quasi - particles moving at speeds less than @xmath227 , the approach to the asymptotic behavior at late times is less abrupt .",
    "in fact , for a lattice dispersion relation where @xmath343 vanishes at the zone boundary , the approach to the limit is slow , as an inverse power of @xmath13 .",
    "a similar result applies to the @xmath77-point functions .",
    "this is consistent with the exact results obtained here and elsewhere .",
    "the existence and the understanding of the asymptotic state resulting from the evolution from an arbitrary state is one of the most - interesting problem in statistical mechanics . a robust theory able to predict this state ab - initio still does not exist .",
    "a currently popular idea is that for late times the system ( or rather macroscopically large subsystems ) ` look like ' they are in a thermal state , despite the fact that the actual state of the whole system is pure .",
    "a common belief is that a region of dimension @xmath88 can be thermalized by the infinitely large rest of the system which acts as a bath ( see e.g. @xcite ) . but this intriguing idea is not sufficient to give the value of the resulting effective temperature .",
    "a major step toward the clarification of the properties of the asymptotic state has been made by rigol et al .",
    "in fact , it was conjectured that if the asymptotic stationary state exists , it is given by a generalized gibbs ensemble obtained by maximizing the entropy @xmath344 , subject to all the constraints imposed by the dynamics @xcite . consequently ,",
    "denoting with @xmath345 a maximal set of commuting and linearly independent integrals of motion , the density matrix is @xmath346 we note that such a density matrix describes a pure state only if the model under consideration is integrable , i.e. if the number of integral of motions equals the number degrees of freedom .",
    "if there are not enough integrals of motion , @xmath347 corresponds to a mixed state and it is not clear to us to which extent it can describe the pure state resulting from the time - evolution .",
    "the values of the lagrange multipliers @xmath348 are fixed by the initial conditions : i_m = i_m_t=0 . in the following",
    "we will take this generalized gibbs ensemble as a postulate and we will show how it nicely and naturally explains the `` effective temperature '' effect observed for large times",
    ". however we stress that there is still no proof for this assumption that , to our opinion , can not be considered on the same fundamental level as the thermal gibbs ensemble .",
    "let us consider the chain of harmonic oscillators of the previous section as a typical example .",
    "we will soon see that most of the features are quite general . in this case",
    "the natural choice for an infinite set of integral of motion is the number of particles with momentum @xmath329 , i.e. @xmath349 . most other observables can be written in terms of these , i.e. @xmath350 . consequently the expectation value is given by _",
    "t== = z^-1 e^-_k _k n_k , that can be seen as a thermal density matrix with a @xmath329 dependent effective temperature given by _",
    "eff(k)_k = _k .",
    "thus an effective temperature already appeared .",

    "+ a_ka^_-k_)= 2_k , that substituting the previous result for @xmath354 gives ( k)_t==_k _ -k_t== 2_k(1 + 2d_k^2)= , that is exactly the time - average of eq .",
    "( [ mdf ] ) reproducing , after fourier transforming , the well defined correlation in real space for @xmath248 .",
    "so this generalized gibbs ensemble correctly reproduces the exact diagonalization of the model and gives also few insights more .",
    "in fact , in the limit @xmath182 the effective temperature is independent from @xmath329 and @xmath207 obtaining @xmath355 , explaining a posteriori the simplicity of the results in this case .",
    "note instead that for arbitrary @xmath189 and @xmath188 , i.e. conformal evolution , @xmath356 is a function of @xmath329 . in this case , the large distance properties of correlation functions are described by the mode with @xmath357 , for which , independently of @xmath189 we get @xmath358 , consistently with the previous findings and general expectations .",
    "furthermore we can conclude that the large @xmath88 asymptotic behavior is always governed by the effective temperature @xmath359 .",
    "another interesting feature is that @xmath360 gives the asymptotic behavior of the correlation functions of all those observables that are effectively coupled with the zero - mode . in the opposite case",
    "the relevant temperature is the largest @xmath356 with the @xmath329 mode coupled with the observable .",
    "another interesting feature is that on a very rough basis one can be tempted to assume that that @xmath356 is directly related to the excess of energy of the mode @xmath329 generated by the quench , but this is not the case .",
    "in fact @xmath361 that is different from @xmath362 , being the same only in the limit @xmath363 , i.e. @xmath182",
    ".    clearly the same reasoning of before applies every time we consider a model that can be diagonalized in momentum space with a proper choice of the quasi - particles , i.e. every time that @xmath364 for some @xmath365 .",
    "this means that the excitations are non - interacting .",
    "as far as we are aware all the applications of the generalized gibbs ensemble to the date only concern this kind of models @xcite , but there are few numerical hints suggesting that can be true more generically @xcite",
    ".    now we outline how we imagine the generalized gibbs ensemble given by eq .",
    "( [ gge ] ) could be used to justify the effective temperature scenario for large time for any integrable system , i.e. with a complete set of integrals of motion .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath366 , with some @xmath367 eventually zero .",
    "thus one can think to an @xmath207-dependent effective temperature @xmath368 , but this temperature does not give directly the behavior of the correlation function for large distance because in general the integral of motions are not diagonal in @xmath329-space .",
    "thus we can only conjecture that the correlation functions of a given operator @xmath369 are governed by the largest @xmath370 with @xmath207 among the integral of motions to which @xmath369 effectively couples .",
    "we stress that this is only a crude argument and we are still not able to put it on a firmer basis .",
    "we presented a quite complete picture on the time evolution of a quantum system after a sudden quench of one hamiltonian parameter . despite the fact that a lot of work has been done ,",
    "still more is left for future investigation .",
    "the first problem that must be addressed is the real - time dynamics of effectively interacting systems . in this direction",
    "bethe ansatz solvable models like the lieb - liniger gas and heisenberg spin chains are among the best candidates for an analytical approach .",
    "this would clarify how a non - trivial two - body scattering matrix can modify the time - evolution ( only inside the light - cone ) of the correlation functions and whether the crude argument we outlined for an `` effective temperature '' for the long - time state is valid . to clarify this point also the study of ( boundary ) integrable massive field theories",
    "can be of some help .",
    "another approach , currently under investigation@xcite , is the direct analysis of the perturbative expansion for the correlation functions in a @xmath371 field theory .",
    "this has some simplifying features in the large @xmath189 limit which may allow it to be resummed to all orders .",
    "it is very important to get non - trivial results for such a non - integrable interacting theory .",
    "numerical computations for non - integrable systems should also be performed to understand if and eventually to which extent the generalized gibbs ensemble picture is valid beyond integrability .",
    "some numerics concerning this point are already available @xcite but still a clear scenario is not emerged . among non - integrable models",
    "special care must be given to disordered systems because of the non existence of a speed of sound as a consequence of anderson localization @xcite .",
    "some insights can be obtained from those models whose equilibrium behavior can be analytically obtained by means of the strong - disorder renormalization - group @xcite . even in this case time - dependent dmrg can help a general understanding .",
    "the time - evolution of the entanglement entropy @xcite already revealed that in these systems there is no sign of the light - cone ( as easily predictable because of the absence of speed of sound ) and the effective motion of `` quasi - particles '' is more diffusive rather than ballistic .",
    "furthermore the results at the largest available times does not look thermal at all , but this can be also due to the time window accessible with numerics .",
    "another very interesting question is what happens at finite temperature and under what conditions a system can equilibrate .",
    "it should be relatively simple to generalize the results for all the `` quasi - free '' models already considered at @xmath144 .",
    "work in this direction is in progress , but it will be almost impossible to consider the same problem for more complicated models .    finally it is also important to understand the role played by the initial state .",
    "we assumed always a translational invariant one with short range correlations .",
    "thus one natural modification consists in taking a state that is only locally different from the actual ground - state .",
    "this problem is known in the literature as a `` local quench '' and it has already been considered to some extent ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but still a general picture as the one outlined here for global quenches does not exist ( this is also interesting for eventual connections with quantum impurity problems , see @xcite as a review ) .",
    "another natural modification of the initial state is one with long - range correlations , such as a critical one and let it evolve with another critical hamiltonian .",
    "this has been done for the luttinger liquid @xcite and the results show the typical functional dependence of a light - cone scenario ( i.e. everything depends only on @xmath372 ) but the long - time correlations decays as power - laws , with exponents that are different from equilibrium ones and can be predicted by the generalized gibbs ensemble .",
