    "understanding the structure of neutrino mixing from first principles is part of the flavor problem of the standard model , one of the deepest in particle physics .",
    "a partial useful strategy is to formulate attractive mixing patterns that may help to seek for possible underlying flavor symmetries .",
    "the tri - bimaximal mixing ( tbm ) ansatz  @xcite for describing the neutrino mixing matrix  @xcite assumes a maximal atmospheric angle and zero reactor angle , as was suggested by the experimental data .",
    "such striking features point towards an underlying symmetry and indeed , many models based on ( mostly discrete ) non - abelian flavour symmetries were successful in reproducing this ansatz  @xcite .",
    "small deviations from the tbm are expected on theoretical grounds .",
    "however the recent results published by the double - chooz  @xcite , daya bay  @xcite , reno  @xcite , t2k  @xcite and minos  @xcite collaborations , indicate that the the reactor angle is relatively large so that corrections to the tbm pattern should be , in fact , quite large , casting doubt on its validity as a good first approximation reproducing the neutrino mixing pattern . to be more precise , on theoretical grounds a small deviation of order of the square of the cabibbo angle was expected for the reactor angle , while recent observations indicate a much larger value of about the order of the cabibbo angle . to evade this problem , different ansatz",
    "have been considered like the bimaximal mixing @xcite or the golden ratio , see @xcite for a review . however , most of these models assume a @xmath2-invariant structure in order to predict a maximal atmospheric mixing angle . on the other hand , at the neutrino 2012 conference the minos collaboration also gave hints for a non - maximal atmospheric mixing angle .",
    "2.mm here we propose a different approach where we take the reactor mixing angle as the fundamental parameter .",
    "as will be shown below , the resulting parametrization does not reproduce the tbm pattern as a limiting case , though a maximal atmospheric angle can be obtained .",
    "the main idea is that , since the reactor angle is the only small mixing parameter for the leptons , we can use it to seed both the solar and atmospheric mixing angles , as follows , @xmath3 where the small parameter @xmath4 is the reactor angle , while @xmath5 are free parameters of order few .",
    "solar and atmospheric mixings are expressed in terms of a linear dependence on the reactor angle . in the limit where @xmath6 neutrinos are unmixed .    using the general symmetric parametrization of the neutrino mixing matrix  @xcite one",
    "can trivially obtain a simple approximate description by expanding only in the small parameter @xmath4 .",
    "for example , the jarlskog - like invariant describing cp violation in neutrino oscillations is then given by : @xmath7 given explicitly in terms of the rephase - invariant dirac combination .",
    "likewise , the effective mass parameter describing the amplitude for neutrinoless double - beta decay is given in terms of the two majorana cp phases .",
    "in what follows , for simplicity , we take all parameters to be real . in order to fix the values of the large parameters",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 we consider the latest experimental results on neutrino oscillation parameters . at the neutrino 2012 conference in kyoto",
    "the minos collaboration has reported a non - maximal value for the atmospheric mixing angle  @xcite : @xmath10 with maximal mixing disfavoured at 88% c.l .",
    "this result comes from the analysis of @xmath11 disappearance in the minos accelerator beam and corresponds to two degenerate points for @xmath12 , namely @xmath13    this comes from the fact that the disappearance channel is octant - symmetric and therefore minos data by themselves can not show a preference for a given octant of @xmath14 .",
    "however , one may expect that in combination with the searches for electron - neutrino appearance at the long - baseline experiments minos and t2k , and with the recent measurements of @xmath0 at reactor experiments the degeneracy in eq .",
    "( [ eq:23 m ] ) will be broken and one octant will be preferred over the other .",
    "global analysis so far have not been able to give a completely clear picture about the true octant of @xmath14 .",
    "the analysis given in  @xcite indicates small deviations of maximality , with the octant preference correlated with the mass hierarchy .",
    "this correlation is also seen in the recent analysis of atmospheric neutrino data in super - kamiokande  @xcite .",
    "however , the analyses given in  @xcite have shown a preference for @xmath15 with different levels of significance .",
    "all previous neutrino oscillation global fits agree in getting @xmath14 in the first octant for normal mass hierarchy , so for the purpose of this article we will assume that this is the case .",
    "here we discuss the recent neutrino oscillation results in terms of our proposed ansatz .",
    "as already pointed out above , the recent experimental data provide a robust measurement of a relatively large @xmath0 .    using the best fit values of the mixing angles in ref.@xcite or ref.@xcite",
    ", we can fix the three parameters in eq.([s13 ] ) : @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . then , from the data we can directly read that @xmath19    now we go a step further and assume the following @xmath20 which in our parametrization means @xmath21 since both solar and atmospheric angles are large we call this case _ bi - large mixing ansatz_.    5.mm suppose now that we are given some model predicting bi - large mixing @xmath22 at leading order .",
    "next - to - leading order operators in the lagrangian in general induce deviations from the reference values in eq .",
    "( [ s13 ] ) which may be reliably determined within a given model . here",
    "we present a simple model - independent estimate of such corrections , obtained as follows .",
    "typically it is expected that the corrections to the three mixing angles from next to leading order terms are of the same order , that is @xmath23 where we have introduced a new parameter @xmath24 to characterize the magnitude of the correction . in this case",
    "our bi - large mixing gets corrections of the same order for the three mixing angles ( given by @xmath24 ) and which may either increase or decrease the starting bi - large values of the mixing angles . for definiteness let us consider an example where bi - large mixing is corrected as @xmath25 where we take @xmath26 as in eq .",

    "now a few words on model building . given a particular mixing matrix @xmath36 ,",
    "the structure of the neutrino mass matrix is fixed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a diagonal matrix . for the sake of illustration",

    "we find that the resulting weak - basis neutrino mass matrix @xmath40 has the form @xmath41 where in the last step the cabibbo angle is used as the expansion parameter and we do not specify numerical coefficients of order one .    from the form obtained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fn1 ] ) one sees that the parameter @xmath1 appears only in the first row . on the other hand in the `` atmospheric sector '' there seems to be `` democracy '' in the choice of the neutrino mass entries . altogether the above",

    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a definite model realization , but rather to stress the simplicity of the ansatz in eq .",
