    "if one of the solutions is complex we have an instability of one of the modes @xmath31 with a growth rate equal to the imaginary part of the solution",
    ". therefore , one can derive the instability threshold for any initial linear wave , i.e. any wavevector and any amplitude .",
    "for example , for @xmath32 , we obtain @xmath33 , which proves that the solution is obviously stable since the zero - mode , corresponding to translation invariance , is completely decoupled from the others .    for @xmath34",

    "the @xmath40-mode is therefore unstable and gives rise to a `` chaotic breather '' , that has a finite life - time and finally disappears leading to energy equipartition ( this complex relaxation process to equipartition is described in detail in ref .",

    "( [ relatdispercorr ] ) , one can compute the growth rate @xmath47 from eq .  ( [ relatdispercorr ] ) @xmath48    it is plotted in fig .  [ growth ] for two different amplitudes .",
    "when the amplitude ( or energy density ) increases , the region of instability extends to a larger region of wavevectors , and in particular the most unstable mode @xmath49 increases reaching an asymptotic value @xmath50 it is important to notice that , for sufficiently high energy , the rescaled growth rate @xmath51 does not depend on the energy density .",
    "this suggests that in the high energy limit a unique time scale is present in the system ; we will discuss in more detail this point in the following .",
    "[ growth ]    one can also derive the lowest unstable mode , whose asymptotic limit at high energy is @xmath52 ( as previously derived in @xcite ) . fig .",

    "for the marginal stability line @xmath55 , our results are fully consistent with a previous theoretical estimation reported in  @xcite .",
    "[ pietro ]    the above results can be generalized to any power @xmath8 .",

    ". therefore , in the hard potential limit the critical energy density for the @xmath40-mode is finite ( @xmath63 ) for any finite @xmath44-value .",
    "it should be noticed that this is not in contradiction with the integrability of a one - dimensional system of hard rods , because in the present case we have also a harmonic contribution at small distances .",
    "finally , we observe that , for the generalized fpu - model , in the high energy limit the growth rate @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is independent of the energy . in summary , for high enough values of the energy ,",
    "@xmath66 we will see in the last section that this scaling law can be also derived from simple dimensional arguments .",
    "let us now report an analytical estimation of the maximal lyapunov .",
    "as the system is hamiltonian , pesin s theorem allows us to identify the kolmogorov - sinai entropy @xmath67 with the sum of all positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "as the lyapunov spectrum was shown  @xcite to be approximately linear at high energy , one can relate @xmath67 to the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath0 , namely @xmath68 let us define a new quantity : the instability entropy @xmath69 where the sum is over all positive growth rates  @xcite .",
    "our crucial physical _",
    "ansatz _ is that @xmath70 . from this assumption",
    "the following expression for the maximal lyapunov exponent is readily derived : @xmath71 employing the analytical values for @xmath56 reported in eq .",
    "( [ growthrate ] ) , @xmath0 can be finally computed .",
    "[ numtheo ] attests that the analytical expression  ( [ analexpr ] ) is very accurate . in the same figure",
    "the data obtained with a completely different approach , developed by casetti , livi and pettini ( clp )  @xcite , are also shown .",
    "the two methods give almost identical results , apart at very low energy , where the clp findings  @xcite is in better agreement with our numerical data @xcite .",
    "in particular , the low energy scaling turns out to be @xmath72 , instead our formula gives @xmath73 .",
    "[ numtheo ]    as a matter of fact , we obtain a very good agreement between our theoretical estimation and the numerical results also for @xmath74 and 3 ( see fig .",
    "[ numtheo ] ) .",
    "plotting @xmath75 in a log - log scale we observe ( see fig .",
    "[ numtheo ] ) that at high energy an asymptotic linear behaviour is found for @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in the low energy limit , however , for any @xmath8 the same scaling behaviour should be found , as confirmed by the data reported in fig .",
    "[ numtheo ] .",
    "the two asymptotic linear behaviors ( at high and low @xmath1 ) are separated by a knee at intermediate @xmath1 .",
    "an estimation of this transition value can be obtained assuming that the linear and nonlinear contributions to @xmath78 should be of the same order .",
    "we obtain @xmath79 i.e. , an energy density of the order of @xmath80 ( this is equivalent to the estimation given by mode overlap criterion@xcite ) .",
    "this knee corresponds to a stochasticity threshold  @xcite which defines the crossing from weak to strong chaos and has been called strong stochasticity threshold ( sst ) ( similar sst - transitions have been recently identified also for other models of nonlinear chains @xcite ) .",
    "however , we have also found that it corresponds to a crossover from extended to a more localized state in tangent space @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable to note that chirikov  @xcite found similarly the maximal lyapunov exponent of the standard map at high energy by averaging over the phase space the maximal eigenvalue associated to the main hyperbolic point .",
    "it corresponds in our case to averaging the growth rate  ( [ growthrate ] ) for the unstable periodic orbit @xmath34 over the equilibrium equipartition state ( where all modes have the same weight ) .",
    "a similar approach is known as toda criterion  @xcite , and although it can not be used as a signature of chaos , it can give an approximate estimation of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , one can understand this average in a better way by recalling that the modes @xmath81,@xmath82,@xmath83 correspond to the simplest unstable periodic orbits and are also the only three one - mode solutions of the @xmath10-fpu problem @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the instability entropies of this three modes shows that they are extremely close one to another , contrary to the value for other modes .",
    "recently , it has been found that very good estimates for @xmath0 can be obtained by applying the clp method directly to any of the above three one - modes solutions @xcite .",
    "this confirms that the dynamics of these one - mode solutions is quite peculiar , because they seem to be `` optimal '' trajectories in the phase - space to estimate the maximal lyapunov exponent .",
    "the normalized instability entropy @xmath84 is plotted against @xmath29 and @xmath1 in fig .  [ yoshi ] .",
    "this should be compared with fig .",
    "2a in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a similar plot is reported for the lyapunov exponent computed from the true jacobian matrix , but taking the linear fourier modes as approximate orbits ( moreover the case of fixed boundary conditions is considered ) . at",
    "fixed @xmath1 both these quantities initially grow with @xmath29 ( low @xmath29 s are more stable than high @xmath29 s ) , but then a `` stability '' region ( meaning that the growth rate of the instability is significantly smaller ) is present around @xmath85 ( numerically estimated as 0.7 @xmath40 by yoshimura in ref .",
    "the `` ridge '' structure observed in  @xcite reduces in our case to two peaks .",
    "the location of the first one depends on @xmath1 and reaches @xmath86 for large energy density ( it is around @xmath87 in the region explored by yoshimura ) .",
    "the second peak is at @xmath88 , and thus goes to @xmath40 in the @xmath89 limit .",
    "we remark that our evaluation of the instability takes fully into account nonlinear effects , contrary to yoshimura s , and that it is completely analytical ( apart from the necessary numerical evaluation of the roots of eq .",
    "( [ relatdispercorr ] ) ) .",
    "mainly , we can confirm that a `` stability '' region ( in the previous sense ) is present around @xmath85 , which corresponds to one of the exact solutions found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "here , our claim is that in the high energy limit the temporal evolution of system ( [ sub ] ) is essentially ruled by a single time - scale .",
    "this time - scale can be easily derived by a simple dimensional argument ( see also  @xcite ) . at high energy density the potential energy per particle scales as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the typical size of @xmath92 , and similarly for the kinetic energy per particle @xmath93 assuming a virial of kinetic and potential energies ( this is shown to hold for the fpu model in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath94 we can introduce a typical time scale @xmath95 therefore , the scaling reported in eq .",
    "( [ scal ] ) is easily recovered and it is natural to expect that the same scaling should hold also for @xmath0 . in particular , for @xmath12 , @xmath0 scales as @xmath96 ( as also found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    a different scaling , with power 2/3 , was found in ref .",
    "@xcite at smaller energy densities ( closer to the strong stochasticity threshold ( sst ) , the knee of fig .  3 ) .",
    "a random matrix approximation  @xcite was invoked to explain these results , which is legitimate only if the process is uncorrelated and one is approaching an integrable limit , where the lyapunov exponent vanishes .",
    "both these approximations can not hold exactly in the region where the 2/3 exponent was found , although a fast decrease of the lyapunov exponent at the knee could mimick the vanishing exponent situation .",
    "for the @xmath10-fpu model ( @xmath12 ) in the high energy limit , an identical scaling has been recently found by lepri  @xcite for the decay - rate of the time autocorrelation functions of the fourier modes and in ref .",
    "@xcite for the inverse of the equipartition time .",
    "we have also verified that the normalized lyapunov spectrum @xmath97 converges to an asymptotic shape ( independent of @xmath1 ) for @xmath98 .",
    "these results confirm our assumption that the dynamics of the system is essentially ruled by an unique time - scale for sufficiently high energy density .",
    "it is important to stress that in the limit of hard core potentials ( @xmath99 ) we find @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , also for potentials that are repulsive ( i.e. diverge as @xmath101 for @xmath102 with @xmath103 , or even steeper ) , we argue that the maximal lyapunov exponent scales as @xmath104 in the high energy density limit .",
    "this claim is also supported by the numerical results in ref  @xcite , where the author studies three different types of potentials , with a repulsive part at short distances : a diatomic toda lattice , a truncated coulomb potential ( tcl ) @xmath105 $ ] and a lennard - jones ( lj ) potential . for the tcl potential and the lj potential , small deviations from the 1/2 power",
    "are found by yoshimura , but these tend to reduce as the energy density increases , as shown by our simulations of the tcl model reported in fig .",
    "[ tcl ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite also the equipartition times are reported , whose scaling with @xmath1 at high energy density is always consistent with an exponent @xmath106 .    finally , for a gas of hard spheres in a three dimensional box the analogue of the energy density is the temperature @xmath107 .",
    "it is well known that for this model the characteristic time is represented by the enskog collision time @xmath108 , which for constant density is proportional to @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that the scaling law @xmath110 should be valid also for a gas of hard spheres at constant density even in three dimensions , as confirmed by recent data for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the mechanism of modulational instability of a plane wave ( for the three admissible exact one - mode solutions ) is strictly connected to lyapunov instability and its study gives quantitative formula for the maximal lyapunov exponent .",
    "this is still somewhat mysterious , because this mechanism deals with the short - time behavior , while the lyapunov instability arises from an infinite - time average .",
    "one possible explanation of the mystery is that the considered unstable orbits perform a good enough sampling of the phase space , which is uniformly visited by a generic orbit in the equipartition state .    scaling laws for the lyapunov exponent at high energy density for generalized fpu chains",
    "have been obtained using the modulational instability approach , but it is also observed that they can be easily guessed by simple dimensional arguments .",
    "this points to the existence of a universal time scale at high energy , independent of the considered quantity ( whether it is the lyapunov exponent or a correlation function ) .",
    "the same universality holds for hard core potentials .",
