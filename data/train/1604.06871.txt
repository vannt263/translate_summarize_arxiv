    "the evolution of low mass stars , such as rr lyrae , can be followed up in the type ii cepheids .",
    "@xcite gives an overview of type ii cepheids ( t2c ) .",
    "the papers by @xcite discuss the classification of t2cs according to their distances from the galactic plane , while the papers by @xcite address the question of the relation of the metallicities and the position of these stars . by investigating the galactic membership based on the kinematic approach",
    "we are able to reconstruct ( within the limits of the model ) the movement of an individual star in the galaxy , which helps us to answer the question of the origin of metal - rich type ii cepheids .",
    "the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs ) in 2012 contained 71 short period t2cs , which were expanded in the time that has passed , but we stick to that sample , because they were relatively bright objects for which there was a chance to find all the data we needed ( the distance or parallax , proper motion , and radial velocity ) .",
    "there are a few approaches for indicating the membership of stars of the galactic components . here",
    ", we shall use the kinematic approach .",
    "we start by converting the distance and position on the sky to the galactocentric cartesian system of galactic coordinates @xmath4 . for this",
    "we use the well - known formulas :    @xmath5    in order to obtain the 3-d position vector and velocity vector of a star in space one needs the following data : two celestial coordinates , distance , two proper - motion components , and the radial velocity . since these are pulsating variable stars they change their radial velocity due to pulsation too , so that one should be cautious when applying the radial velocity values .    in our original sample",
    "these necessary data were not available for all stars . for some stars we do not have the parallax or radial velocity , or both .",
    "all the data necessary for calculating the velocity components are available for seven stars in total .",
    "all the input data should be transformed into the heliocentric cartesian system ; for this purpose we use the procedure described in @xcite . then we correct velocity values for the solar motion .",
    "the obtained velocity components @xmath6 are with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "the magnitude of the lsr velocity @xmath7 ,    @xmath8    is indicative of the star membership , to the thin disc , thick disc , or halo .",
    "if for a star the magnitude of the lsr velocity is very high ( say , exceeds 250  kms@xmath9 ) , then the probability that this star belongs to the thin or thick disc is very low .",
    "if it exceeds , say 100  kms@xmath9 , then only the probability of belonging to the thin disc is very low .",
    "the stars which had all the required data are listed in table  [ table1:stars ] .",

    "the lines show the approximate limits between the subsystems in the galaxy : the innermost part being the thin disc , then the thick disc , and finally the halo .",
    "out of the 71 stars we have studied , only 7 had enough data available to be examined in our model . even though we are aware of a substantial error influence in the input data , we are still comfortable with stating that the model results do give us the galactic membership of the stars .",

    "dq and is the only star which shows evidence of being a member of the halo of the milky way , but the asymmetry of its calculated orbit is peculiar .",
    "if we consider that the milky way has experienced collisions with neighbouring dwarf galaxies , this asymmetry could be due to the capture of this star by our galaxy or its motion around the centre of the milky way might have been perturbed .    in the following years the astrometric measurements from the @xmath3 satellite should give us much more insight into the understanding of the galactic membership of type ii cepheids .",
