    "how long does it take a particle to tunnel through a barrier ?",
    "this question , first raised by 1932 @xcite , still arouses extreme controversy today ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the subject went through a renaissance theoretically in the 1980s@xcite , followed by much experimental work in the 1990s , particularly using electromagnetic analogs to tunnelling such as single - photon transmission through `` photonic bandgap '' media@xcite and microwave transmission through waveguides beyond cutoff@xcite .",
    "we will not review our single - photon experiments here , as they have been extensively discussed elsewhere .",
    "in particular , we refer the reader to a recent review@xcite , in which we discuss the history of the tunnelling - time conundrum , along with the experiments on electromagnetism and the thorny issues of superluminality and causality .    for",
    "what the experiments have confirmed is the validity of the stationary - phase approximation for wave packet propagation through a tunnel barrier ( a time frequently referred to as the `` phase time , '' but which we prefer to term the `` group delay '' in order to avoid misunderstandings about phase vs. group velocities ) . at the heart of the problem",
    "is the fact that the kinetic energy of a particle inside a tunnel barrier is negative , so that a semiclassical estimate of its velocity becomes imaginary .",
    "this makes it impossible to make the nave first approximation that the duration of a tunnelling event is the barrier width divided by the velocity @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , it means that the wave vector inside the forbidden region is imaginary , leading to exponential decay ( or growth ) , in lieu of the accumulation of phase .",
    "as no phase is accumulated ( except near the boundaries , where the relative amplitudes of the evanescent and anti - evanescent waves are varying significantly ) , the group delay becomes independent of barrier thickness for `` opaque '' barriers ( _ i.e. _ , barriers much wider than an exponential decay length ) . for wide enough barriers , a wave packet peak may emerge from the far side at a time significantly shorter than what would be required for a peak travelling at the vacuum velocity of light @xmath1 .",
    "as long as the bandwidth of the signal ( typically taken to be gaussian in theoretical work , as well as in certain experiments ) is sufficiently small , an essentially undistorted ( but greatly attenuated ) pulse appears to have travelled faster than light .",
    "as explained in @xcite and references therein , no _ information _ can be sent faster than light using these effects . to sum the arguments up briefly",
    ", the wave exiting the barrier can be expressed by integrating a _ perfectly causal _ response function : @xmath2 the behaviour of @xmath3 at times @xmath4 has no impact whatever on the behaviour of @xmath5 .",
    "remarkably , the effect of a tunnel barrier is to perform an extrapolation into the future ( a taylor expansion@xcite ) by combining paths with slightly different delays @xmath6 out of phase with one another@xcite . whether for a gaussian wave packet or a piece by mozart , the outcome is a convincing reproduction of the incident wave form ; some workers therefore argue that signal propagation for such frequency - band - limited waves indeed occurs faster than @xmath1@xcite .",
    "naturally , the difficulty lies with attempts to define ( or to avoid defining ) `` information '' and `` signal . ''",
    "only recently have workers attempted to apply a rigorous definition  la shannon@xcite , but in our opinion , this application has not yet clarified matters . the cases of superluminal propagation all occur when the `` advance '' of the transmitted wave remains within a region over which the function can be analytically continued . it is well known that no _ abrupt _ disturbance would propagate faster than @xmath1 , and recent electronic - circuit experiments@xcite demonstrate that this is entirely consistent with the ability of superluminal systems to `` guess '' the future by analytic continuation the new feature is simply that at any point of nonanalyticity , the system will guess wrong .",
    "those who argue for superluminal signal velocities suggest that since bandwidths are always limited in practice , such abrupt fronts and `` points of nonanalyticity '' do not exist . a signal defined practically , in terms of a well - defined waveform with a good signal - to - noise ratio , may indeed arrive sooner when tunnelling than when propagating freely ( although the time - integrated power will always be less in the presence of the barrier ) .",
    "the question of how best to approximate physical reality with infinite tails in the frequency domain and abrupt changes in time , or with infinite `` precursors '' in time and sharp cutoffs in frequency is an interesting one , often sidestepped .",
    "alas , we choose for now to remain within this tradition . in our opinion , when one talks of a signal velocity , one implicitly refers to the velocity of _ new _ information arriving at a receiver .",
    "if one accepts that a transmitted waveform is strictly band - limited in frequency , and can therefore be predicted well in advance of its peak by analytic continuation , then the peak does not carry any new information . when information is found at the receiver , there is no reason to refer this back to the time of emission of the peak .",
    "in particular , equation ( 1 ) shows that information about @xmath7 at times @xmath8 will _ always _ suffice to predict what a receiver observes at @xmath9 at times up to @xmath10 .",
    "if any new information is sent after @xmath11 , the receiver will be unaware of it until a time @xmath12 .",
    "the possibility of a _ shape _ appearing at @xmath13 and resembling a shape emitted at @xmath14 in no way alters this .",
    "it means merely that the information available ( even under free propagation ) was already sufficient for _ predicting _ the shape which was to come .",
    "( in the case of mozart travelling less than a metre at several times the speed of light , this is another way of saying that it is possible to extrapolate a @xmath15 khz signal a nanosecond into the future without significant distortion ! ) in sum , a tunnel barrier acts as a marvelous analog computer for signal processing . under appropriate circumstances , it can take the leading edge of a signal and reshape it into a facsimile of the signal s main content . while in conjunction with amplification@xcite , this may even turn out to be useful , it is no different from what a digital signal processing chip could do by application of equation ( 1 ) to a freely - propagating waveform . therefore , as in the latter case , we conclude that tunnelling may reduce the delay necessary to _ process _ an incoming signal and _ extract _ information from it , but it in no way alters the arrival time of the new information itself .",
    "it has long been recognized@xcite that the delay of a wave packet peak need not be the unique definition of a tunnelling time ( need not , in fact , have any physical significance at all in the view of those authors ) .",
    "many other times have been proposed to describe the `` interaction '' of a particle with a tunnel barrier , or the duration of its `` sojourn '' or `` dwell '' in the forbidden region . using the weak - measurement formalism of aharonov and vaidman@xcite",
    ", we have found that many of these can be unified , and shown to correspond to a general description of von neumann - style quantum measurements on a _",
    "subensemble _ post - selected to contain only transmitted particles@xcite . the classic thought - experiment of this sort is the larmor clock@xcite , but application of the weak - measurement formalism makes it straightforward to obtain physical interpretations of the several components of the larmor time , as well as their generalisation to a broader class of measurements .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , a number of these predictions are striking enough to merit experimental test . summarized briefly , we predict that as defined by the outcome of a classically - conceived measurement , the time spent by a tunnelling particle near the middle of a barrier is exponentially small . on the other hand , transmitted particles spend roughly equal amounts of time near the two classical turning points , while reflected particles only spend time near the entrance . throughout the entire region , attempts to detect the particle do on the other hand lead to quantum back - action , which is at the origin of the interpretational difficulties .",
    "perhaps more interesting , it appears that for these post - selected subensembles , there may be a measurable sense in which a particle can be in two places at one time .",
    "here we are not referring to the well - known fact that a wave function passes through _ both slits _ of a two - slit interferometer , or in general to the idea that every outcome is an integral over many feynman paths . in these cases",
    ", no attempt is made to _ measure _ the position of the particle at the slits .",
    "most discussion centers on how such a measurement , if sufficiently accurate to determine which slit is traversed , destroys interference .",
    "we are interested in the reverse scenario .",
    "we consider such a gentle , larmor - style measurement that on no individual occasion can we tell whether or not a particle was observed . by building up enough statistics",
    ", we can nevertheless draw conclusions about how much time the average particle spent interacting with the measuring device . in the larmor framework ,",
    "the particle is a spin initially polarized along the @xmath16-direction , and the measuring apparatus is a weak magnetic field along @xmath17 , confined to a small region of space .",
    "this field sets a larmor precession frequency @xmath18 , and a particle spending some length of time @xmath19 in the interaction region will precess through an angle @xmath20 . for a spin-1/2 particle , this angle is of course only measurable by averaging over many trials , but it is straightforward to separate transmitted and reflected particles , so as to measure their polarisations ( and hence dwell times ) separately .",
    "we have made predictions for the outcome of such measurements , in the form of time - dependent `` conditional probability distributions''@xcite .",
    "these distributions reflect the anomalously fast ( potentially superluminal ) arrival of a wave packet peak .",
    "in fact , for thick enough barriers , one can choose spacelike - separated regions of spacetime centered at opposite edges of the barrier in such a way that the conditional probability of the particle being in either one is arbitrarily close to 100% , since the wave packet peaks themselves are spacelike - separated .",
    "the question arises : can a single particle have an effect on two spacelike - separated measuring devices ?",
    "there is no problem with causality , since the _ emission _ of the particle may be in causal contact with both measuring devices .",
    "only the locality of a quantum particle is called into question , but in a way which can not be directly addressed in familiar situations such as the two - slit experiment , the epr effect , or the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "consider a _ gedankenexperiment _ along the lines illustrated in the spacetime diagram of figure 1 .",
    "a wave packet tunnels superluminally through a barrier wide enough that the bulk of the transmitted packet is causally disconnected from the bulk of the incident packet . in this case , two weak - measurement devices could be turned on in such a way that the incident particles have a probability arbitrarily close to 100% of interacting with the first , the transmitted particles have a probability arbitrarily close to 100% of interacting with the second , _ and _ that the two measurement regions are entirely spacelike separated .",
    "the two measurement regions might , for example , be pulsed magnetic fields pointing along * + z * to the left of the barrier and along * -z * to the right of the barrier . in this way",
    ", a spin will have precessed in one direction if it sees only the first measurement region , in the other direction if it sees only the second , and not at all if it sees both for equal lengths of time . after transmission",
    ", the particles are filtered in energy in such a way that their time of emission can no longer be determined , and it is impossible to trace a particle s trajectory back to either region .",
    "one could conceive of a model of reality which forbids any single particle from being affected measurably by two spacelike - separated devices .",
    "most physicists seem to subscribe to such a model , and it is not yet known whether this is truly consistent with quantum mechanics .",
    "based on the weak measurement picture , we expect that each particle will indeed be affected by both measuring devices . in other words ,",
    "if only one field or the other is switched on , the spins will precess .",
    "but if both fields are on , rather than observing a mixture of spins which have precessed clockwise and spins which have precessed counter - clockwise , we believe that the spins will remain essentially unaffected .",
    "this is supported by calculations using the time - independent schrdinger equation , which show that to first order , the effects of two such larmor fields cancel out identically .",
    "we are currently planning to perform true time - dependent calculations .",
    "we intend to construct inequalities constraining `` corpuscular '' models in which a particle can not be affected by both fields , and to test these inequalities by studying tunnelling atoms .",
    "this will constitute a test of single - particle nonlocality of a new sort , related to what aharonov and coworkers term the `` reality of the wave function''@xcite .",
    "we believe that in order to study these quantum subensembles , laser - cooled atoms offer a unique tool . they can routinely be cooled into the quantum regime , where their de broglie wavelengths are on the order of microns , and their time evolution takes place in the millisecond regime .",
    "they can be directly imaged , and if they are made to impinge on a laser - induced tunnel barrier , transmitted and reflected clouds should be spatially resolvable . with various internal degrees of freedom ( hyperfine structure as well as zeeman sublevels ) ,",
    "they offer a great deal of flexibility for studying the various interaction times and nonlocality - related issues .",
    "in addition , extensions to dissipative interactions and questions related to irreversible measurements and the quantum - classical boundary are easy to envision.@xcite    we are working on an atom - optics experiment which will let us directly test these questions .",
    "we start with a sample of laser - cooled rubidium atoms transferred from a magneto - optic trap ( mot ) and optical molasses cooling phase to a magnetic trap at approximately 6 @xmath21 .",
    "we plan to use a tightly focussed beam of intense light detuned far to the blue of the d2 line to create a dipole - force potential for the atoms@xcite . using a 500 mw laser at 770 nm",
    ", we will be able to make repulsive potentials with maxima on the order of the doppler temperature of the rubidium vapour .",
    "acousto - optical modulation of the beam will let us shape these potentials with nearly total freedom , such that we can have the atoms impinge on a thin plane of repulsive light , whose width would be on the order of the cold atoms de broglie wavelength .",
    "this is because the beam may be focussed down to a spot several microns across ( somewhat larger than the wavelength of atoms in a mot , but of the order of that of atoms just below the recoil temperature , and hence accessible by a combination of cooling and selection techniques ) .",
    "this focus may be rapidly displaced @xcite by using acousto - optic modulators . as the atomic motion is in the mm / sec range ,",
    "the atoms respond only to the time - averaged intensity , which can be arranged to have a nearly arbitrary profile .    as a second stage of cooling ,",
    "we follow the mot and optical molasses with an improved variant of a proposal termed `` delta - kick cooling''@xcite . in our version",
    ", the millimetre - sized cloud is allowed to expand for about ten milliseconds , to several times its initial size .",
    "this allows individual atoms positions @xmath22 to become strongly correlated with atomic velocity , @xmath23 .",
    "magnetic field coils are then used in either a quadrupole or a harmonic configuration to provide a position - dependent restoring force for a short period of time . by proper choice of this impulse",
    ", one can greatly reduce the rms velocity of the atoms .",
    "figure 2 shows free - expansion data comparing atoms expanding from an optical molasses with and without a quadrupole delta - kick . as can be seen by the narrow horizontal width of the latter distribution at late times ( the narrow peak is difficult to distinguish from these pictures at early times , but already present in the raw data )",
    ", the thermal velocity has been greatly reduced .",
    "the one - dimensional temperature appears to be about 700 nk , corresponding to a de broglie wavelength of about half a micron .",
    "we are currently working on improving this temperature by producing stronger , more harmonic potentials , and simultaneously providing an antigravity potential in order to increase the interaction time .",
    "however , the tunnelling probability through a 5-micron focus will still be negligible at these temperatures .",
    "furthermore , the exponential dependence of the tunnelling rate on barrier height will be difficult to distinguish from the exponential tail of a thermal distribution at high energies .",
    "we will therefore follow the delta - kick with a velocity - selection phase@xcite . by using the same beam which is to form a tunnel barrier , but increasing the width to many microns",
    ", we will be able to `` sweep '' the lowest - energy atoms from the center of the magnetic trap off to the side , leaving the hotter atoms behind .",
    "figure 3 shows the results of simulations for atoms at an initial temperature of 900 nk , trapped in a 5 g / cm field ( corresponding to 300 @xmath24k / cm ) . superposing a 20-@xmath24 m gaussian beam with a peak height of 300 nk onto this v - shaped potential",
    "creates a local minimum with a depth of 70 nk , supporting a single quasi - bound state with a kinetic energy of 13 nk .",
    "translating this barrier through the cloud at @xmath25 mm / s is seen to transfer about 7% of the atoms into this ground state .",
    "this new , smaller sample will have a thermal de broglie wavelength of approximately @xmath26 m , leading to a significant tunnelling probability through a 10-micron barrier .",
    "we expect rates on the order of 1% per secular period , causing the auxiliary trap to decay via tunnelling on a timescale of the order of 100 ms .",
    "once these cooling and selection techniques are perfected , we will have a unique system in which to study tunnelling . by using optical pumping ,",
    "stimulated raman transitions , and other such probes , we will be able to go beyond simple wave packet studies to investigate the interactions of tunnelling atoms while in the forbidden region itself . in this way",
    ", we hope to shed new light on this fascinating phenomenon , but also on nonlocality in quantum mechanics more generally .",
