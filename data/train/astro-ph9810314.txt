    "we propose that the time variable features in  also originate in jets and that the variation in energy of these features is due to precession . fitting a sinusoid to the variation in energy of the 0.74  kev feature during too2 and assuming a rest energy of 0.65  kev ( ie . that the line is o  viii k@xmath56 ) implies a precessional period of @xmath26  days and a velocity of @xmath93 ( 1@xmath47 uncertainty ) .",
    "asca  observations of some high mass x - ray binary pulsars such as velax-1 ( @xcite ) reveal spectra rich in he - like emission lines , almost certainly due to reprocessing in circumstellar material .",
    "the stationary lines ( si  xiii , s  xv , fe  xxv , and possibly ca  xix ) most probably originate in circumstellar matter .",
    "the identification of the moving features with emission from h - like ions ( although the rest energies are uncertain ) , and the stationary ones with he - like ions , is consistent with this interpretation . in the case of ss443 two sets of moving x - ray lines",
    "are seen ( @xcite ) , although earlier studies had revealed only one ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "this was explained by assuming that one beam was occulted by the accretion disk at certain precession phases ( @xcite ) .",
