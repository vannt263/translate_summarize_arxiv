    "galaxy groups in the local universe harbor a large population of massive galaxies with elliptical morphology and quenched star formation @xcite .",
    "observations indicate that , to a large extent , this results from environmental forcing over the past eight billion years since redshift @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "many physical processes may be responsible for making elliptical morphologies and quenching star formation ; major and minor merging , ram pressure stripping , accretion shocks , and removal of hot gas are among those that have been suggested as possible mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the challenge is to connect the large - scale , cosmological formation of the group , which affects the global evolution of group members , to the galactic sub - kpc scale , where star formation and stellar feedback dominate the physics of the gas and the galaxy morphology @xcite .    both numerical simulations of the galaxy population in a cosmological context(e.g . , @xcite ) and",
    "semi - analytical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) have , however , lacked so far the ability to describe at once the various environmental processes that can affect the baryonic component of galaxies , due to lack of resolution or the incomplete knowledge of the interplay between such processes .",
    "therefore , despite the observational evidence that galaxy evolution is affected by the galactic environment , how this happens within the cold dark matter scenario for the formation of cosmic structure is highly debated today .",
    "this notwithstanding the results of detailed , small scale numerical models , abstracted from the large - scale cosmological context ( e.g. , @xcite ) , have repeatedly shown how mergers , tidal interactions , ram pressure stripping of the cold and hot gas phase as well as gas accretion from the surrounding intergalactic medium can change the morphology of individual galaxies , and alter their star formation rates ( sfrs ) and colors .",
    "recent progress in the modeling of the formation of galaxies in the cosmological context has finally shown that realistic galaxies can be formed in the cold dark matter model once galaxies are resolved with @xmath3 baryonic particles and at a sub - kpc resolution @xcite , but this has only been achieved so far for individual galaxies in low - density ( field ) environments .    therefore , key questions remain when , and how , the disks are transformed into spheroids , star formation is quenched , and stellar mass is accreted in the massive galaxies that end up residing preferentially in the dense environments at @xmath4 .",
    "we address these key questions with the help of a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation that follows the concurrent evolution of many galaxies before , during , and after they join a relatively dense , group - sized virialized region with virial radius @xmath5 kpc and virial mass @xmath6 @xmath7 at @xmath8 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe our simulation and analysis methods in  [ sect : sim ] and [ sect : analysis ] , respectively . in  [ sect : results ] we present and discuss our main results , including the properties of the group satellite galaxies (  [ sect : hubble ] and [ sect : scaling ] ) , and the origin of the morphological and photometric transformations (  [ sect : drivers ] ) .",
    "we conclude in  [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "the simulation set - up and the employed zoom - in technique is described in detail elsewhere @xcite . in brief , a group halo is selected from a dark matter simulation of a 123 mpc periodic box .",
    "higher resolution initial conditions centered on the group with wmap-3 cosmological parameters @xcite are generated using ` grafic-2 ` @xcite .",
    "the simulation is run with the parallel treesph code ` gasoline ` @xcite .",
    "the mass ( force ) resolution of the simulation is @xmath9 @xmath7 ( 0.5 kpc ) , @xmath10 @xmath7 ( 0.3 kpc ) , and @xmath11 @xmath7 ( 0.3 kpc ) for dark matter , gas and star particles , respectively , which allows us to resolve the half - mass radii of the massive group members ( @xmath12 kpc ) .",
    "we output 92 snapshots between @xmath13 and @xmath14 equidistant in time , i.e. , with @xmath15 myr .",
    "besides following gravitational , hydrodynamical , and optically thin radiative processes of matter in an expanding universe directly , the simulation includes modeling of star formation , feedback from type ia and type ii supernovae , mass loss by stellar winds , and metal enrichment .",
    "the simulation parameters were originally tuned to produce disk galaxies in galactic halos @xcite .",
    "we use a star formation efficiency per free fall time of 0.05 , and allow stars to form in a probabilistic fashion if the density exceeds 0.1 @xmath16 , the gas temperature is lower than 15,000 k , the gas is in an overdense ( @xmath17 ) region , and part of a convergent flow .",
    "a thermal feedback of @xmath18 erg is injected into the gas per supernova .",
    "the cooling of the gas is turned off for the time corresponding to the end of the snowplow phase of a supernova type ii blast wave @xcite .",
    "the cooling is not disabled for supernovae of type ia .",
    "the simulation includes stellar mass loss due to stellar winds and a spatially uniform uv background @xcite .",
    "the simulation we present here corresponds to the run g2-hr in @xcite where it has been used to analyze the properties of a massive , central group galaxy .",
    "as we show in  [ sect : scaling ] , the same physical prescriptions produce , when used to simulate a relatively massive potential of a group of galaxies , @xmath8 galaxies with a broad range of luminosities , sizes and kinematics , which are roughly consistent with the properties of disk and elliptical galaxies in the local universe .",
    "they are also adequate to produce massive , early - type galaxies at the centers of galaxy groups @xcite .",
    "halos and halo centers are identified with the amiga halofinder ( ahf ; @xcite ) , that is capable of detecting sub - halos ( our satellites ) within halos ( our group ) .",
    "halos extend out to the virial radius @xmath19 , which we define as the radius enclosing a mean matter density of @xmath20 times the mean density of the universe , or out to the tidal radius , whichever is smaller .",
    "the virial mass @xmath21 is the mass within @xmath19 .",
    "we then use the following technique to track satellites over time .",
    "first , we identify each halo @xmath22 in each snapshot @xmath23 below @xmath24 that @xmath25 has a bound mass of more than @xmath26 @xmath7 , @xmath27 contains more than 50000 particles , and @xmath28 lies within 630 comoving kpc from the group center .",
    "second , for each such determined halo @xmath29 we determine its main progenitor @xmath30 in the previous snapshot and its main successor @xmath31 in the following snapshot and construct a complete timeline @xmath32 by recursion .",
    "let @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 be the number of particles in halo @xmath36 , the number of particles in halo @xmath37 and the number of particles common to both halos , respectively .",
    "we then use the ratio @xmath38 to define main successors and progenitors .",
    "specifically , we define the halo with the largest @xmath39 from snapshot @xmath40 ( any halo is in principle eligible , not only the ones selected as described above ) as the main successor of halo @xmath29 and the halo with the largest @xmath39 from snapshot @xmath41 as the main progenitor ( but excluding the parent group halo ) .",
    "since the group halo @xmath42 is a potential main successor this algorithm sometimes finds multiple timelines for a given halo @xmath29 .",
    "for instance , the following timelines of halo @xmath29 could be produced : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . in this case",
    ", we only keep the timeline that traces the halo @xmath29 as long as possible as an entity separate from the group halo ( which is the first timeline in the example ) . following this procedure ,",
    "we obtain @xmath46 satellites of which 13 have not merged with the central galaxy by @xmath14 .    unless noted otherwise sfrs",
    "are measured within a sphere of 20 physical kpc .",
    "the specific sfr is obtained by dividing the sfr by the stellar mass .",
    "stellar masses are defined as the mass of the stellar component that is bound to the halo ( using ahf ) within a sphere of 20 physical kpc .",
    "this radius encloses almost all ( @xmath47% on average , 91% for the largest galaxy at @xmath14 ; @xmath48 at @xmath49 ) of the stellar mass of non - central group members within their virial ( or truncation ) radius .",
    "kinematic properties are determined from a slit that is 24 kpc long , 2 kpc wide and contains 24 bins along the two - dimensional major axis of an edge - on view of the galaxy .",
    "the rotation velocities and dispersions are determined from the moments of the line - of - sight velocities . in figures [ fig : sat ] and [ fig : vrot ] we measure the moments of the line - of - sight velocities on inclined galaxies with an inclination - band tully  fisher relation , see figure [ fig : sat ] , on a sample of disk galaxies with a median inclination of @xmath50 . ] of @xmath51 and then correct for the inclination by diving the velocities by @xmath52 .",
    "maximal rotation velocities @xmath53 are taken to be half the difference between the maximum and the minimum rotation velocity along the slit .",
    "central velocity dispersions @xmath54 are measured within a 1 kpc aperture",
    ". the measured value is increased by a factor 1.1 to account for the radial decline of the velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath55 refers to the ratio of maximum rotation velocity and central velocity dispersion .",
    "cold gas is defined as the gas with a temperature of less then @xmath56 k , unless noted otherwise .",
    "the neutral hydrogen mass is derived from the hydrogen mass fraction that is calculated within gasoline during the simulation .",
    "our simulation does not include an explicit treatment of molecular hydrogen .",
    "hence , in the analysis we do not distinguish between atomic and molecular hydrogen components .",
    "colors ( all in the ab - system ) are derived from stellar synthesis models , typically from the models of @xcite , but we have also tested the single stellar populations of @xcite finding that the latter reddens the @xmath57 color at @xmath14 of galaxies with @xmath58 by up to 0.1 mag .",
    "hence uncertainties in the stellar population models are unlikely to have strong effects on our results , but can nonetheless change colors and magnitudes by a few percent .",
    "we reduce the effect of star formation in the central region on the colors by fixing the mass - to - light ratio from within one softening length to its value at one softening length . in order to estimate the effect of a very young ( @xmath59 myr ) stellar component , we have tested a simplified version of the dust - obscuration model of @xcite , namely , reducing the flux of the very young stellar particles to zero as done in , e.g. , @xcite , but not applying any further dust corrections .",
    "we find that galaxies with @xmath57 colors below @xmath12 are typically reddened by @xmath60-@xmath61 mag and redder galaxies are affected on a less than 0.05 mag level . given that the corrections are overall rather small we will refer to the single stellar populations of @xcite without a flux reduction of very young stars .",
    "the smoothed particle hydrodynamics technique allows us to follow the temperature history of individual gas parcels .",
    "we track the temperature history of each gas particle over all snapshots in order to assess whether accreted gas has been cooled from a hot halo or whether it stayed cold since the beginning of the simulation .",
    "we determine for each gas particle its maximum temperature over its history , but ignore the times when a gas particle is less than 30 kpc away from the satellite center in order to avoid that its maximum temperature is set by supernova feedback , see @xcite .",
    "we identify gas particles with a maximum temperature above ( below ) @xmath62 k as contributors to hot ( cold ) accretion @xcite . despite its simplicity this temperature - based split into hot / cold accretion",
    "gives similar results compared to more sophisticated treatments @xcite .",
    "since each star particle is spawned from a unique gas particle we can also use the maximum temperature of the spawning gas particle to asses whether a star particle has been formed from gas that was accreted hot or cold .    to obtain the net , instantaneous accretion rates of gas and stars onto a satellite galaxy",
    "we first determine its center - of - mass velocity from all particles within a sphere of 20 kpc .",
    "radial velocities @xmath63 of gas and star particles are then computed in the rest frame of the satellite .",
    "we then estimate the net mass flux of , e.g. , gas with a maximum temperature below @xmath62 k , by summing over all particles of the relevant type in a spherical shell at @xmath64 kpc distance from the center @xmath65 here , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the mean density and volume of the spherical shell .",
    "its thickness is 10 kpc to ensure that it contains at least several hundred particles . for the accretion of bound material",
    "we only include the particles identified as bound to the satellite by ahf , otherwise we use all the particles in the shell .",
    "we quantify the mass loss of cold gas due to consumption and stripping by tracing forward in time the cold gas particles that are contained within 20 kpc at a snapshot @xmath68-@xmath69 myr before infall time .",
    "we consider that an initially cold gas particle may be kept as gas particle within a 20 kpc distance ( `` kept '' ) , that it may be kept after being transformed into a star particle ( `` consumed '' ) , or that it leaves the 20 kpc radius ( `` stripped '' ) .",
    "a small , but non - negligible fraction of the `` kept '' gas is heated , e.g. , by supernova feedback .",
    "however , to first order the heating and cooling of gas should balance and hence the heated gas mass will be replaced by a similar gas mass of cooled gas .",
    "hence , the `` kept '' gas mass should roughly correspond to the kept cold gas mass .",
    "the stated mass fractions and errors refer to the mean and the standard deviation of the various mass fractions for all @xmath14 gas - poor satellites .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in figure  [ fig : merger ] we illustrate , as an example , how the transformation into a gas - poor , quiescent , red , velocity - dispersion supported elliptical galaxy takes place as a two - step process , starting from gas - rich , star - forming , blue , rotating galaxies .",
    "first , at @xmath70 and at @xmath12 mpc distance from the group center , a gas - rich merger with a stellar mass ratio @xmath71 destroys the stellar disk of the more massive progenitor .",
    "the remnant relaxes in a few hundred myr to an elliptical morphology , but its colors remain blue and it still hosts a substantial amount ( @xmath72 @xmath7 ) of hi within 20 kpc . during the merger the sfr",
    "is substantially enhanced @xcite ; at its peak , it is about a factor five higher than the average rate that the galaxy experiences throughout its history .",
    "thereafter the hi reservoir and the sfr gradually decrease .",
    "after the first pericenter , the sfr and the hi content become negligible and the galaxy turns into a red , passively evolving elliptical ( @xmath73 in the sdss @xmath14 redshifted @xmath74-filter ; @xcite ) with a final @xmath75 .",
    "we note that one of the seven @xmath4 elliptical satellites does not undergo any substantial merger since @xmath76 ( red triangle in figure figure  [ fig : stellmass ] ) .",
    "this galaxy assembles most of its stellar mass early on , i.e. , much earlier than most disk satellites .",
    "not surprisingly , this results in a massive and very compact spheroidal system .",
    "we speculate that the very diverse stellar density and velocity dispersion properties observed in the @xmath77 passive galaxy population @xcite could be , at least in part , explained by a spread in the assembly epochs of its constituent galaxies .",
    "although the ultimate quenching of galaxies is caused by stripping of the gas reservoir and the resulting suppression of star formation after galaxies enter the group potential , we note that their star formation histories start being affected by environmental effects also prior to their infall . for most galaxies , the sfr peaks around @xmath78 at a distance of @xmath12 mpc ( @xmath79turn around radius ) from the center of the assembling group .",
    "afterward , a different behavior is seen in the progenitors of the present - day population of , respectively , disk and elliptical galaxies . in the progenitors of disks ,",
    "star formation declines smoothly from high to low redshift until truncation ensues , reflecting the fact that these galaxies evolve in near isolation before joining the group .",
    "in contrast , the sfr of the progenitors of ellipticals , which are gas - rich , massive disk - like objects , shows high variability , with bursts caused by galaxy interactions and mergers ( figure [ fig : timeevolution ] ) .    as similar dichotomy occurs for gas accretion , which happens predominantly in the `` cold mode '' for all galaxies prior to infall onto the group . in galaxies which remain disks down to @xmath4 ,",
    "the accretion rate decreases gradually with time @xcite , see figure [ fig : acc ] . in the early - type galaxies ,",
    "the rate is instead rather bursty and strongly modulated by the mergers these systems endure . in some galaxies , the decrease in the cold accretion rate is exacerbated by `` truncation '' of the streams due to the reduction of the tidal radius of the satellites ( driven by the tidal effects of the group halo potential ; @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to quenching of gas accretion already at a few virial radii away from the group center . in at least one of the gas - poor disks ( figures  [ fig : acc ] , and [ fig : timeevolution ] )",
    ", the supply of cold gas is already terminated when it resides in the vicinity of a @xmath80 halo that falls into the main group at a substantially later time .",
    "our work shows that the formation of @xmath81 elliptical galaxies and `` starved '' red disk galaxies in high - density environments such as galaxy groups is the result of the combined effect of merging , gas removal and gas consumption processes as well as halted gas accretion naturally occurring as the potential of the group is assembled hierarchically in a @xmath82 universe .",
    "our simulations do not include feedback from agns and thus show that it is not an essential ingredient in order to form elliptical galaxies with quenched star formation in @xmath8 galaxy groups .    specifically , we find that elliptical galaxies are formed by mergers at high redshift _ prior _ to the formation of the final group , which is consistent with the fact that elliptical galaxies are found to be already in place at high redshift even in the field .",
    "the lag of photometric transformations relative to the morphological transformations seen in our simulation indicates that many of the `` excess '' blue @xmath83 galaxies observed at @xmath84 , which are thought to become @xmath83 ellipticals , but which appear to have an irregular morphology at blue rest - frame wavelengths @xcite , should show an elliptical morphology when observed at longer rest - frame wavelengths .",
    "this is a straight prediction of our simulations since at the time when their old stars acquire an elliptical morphology through mergers , the simulated galaxies still host a star - forming , gaseous component .",
    "this also indicates that the tight correlation of colors and hubble types , as well as the standard classification based on the hubble sequence , does not hold for galaxies at redshifts higher than about @xmath85 , in good agreement with state - of - the - art studies of galaxy morphologies at such high redshifts @xcite .",
    "in addition , our model predicts that the star formation and gas accretion rates of progenitors of elliptical galaxies in the considered mass range ( @xmath86 ) should be highly irregular due to gas - rich galaxy interactions and mergers at intermediate redshifts @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , these galaxies should show a large scatter in the ages of their stellar populations and differ from single , high redshift burst models @xcite .",
    "future multi - wavelength observations capable of characterizing with unprecedented detail both the sfr evolution and the evolution of the gas content of galaxies , atomic and molecular , as a function of redshift , such as the atacama large millimeter array , the james webb space telescope , and the square kilometer array , will be able to test this scenario ."
