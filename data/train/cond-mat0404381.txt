    "recent advances in the manipulation of cold atomic gases allow nowadays for storing bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite optical lattices , opening a pathway for the experimental and theoretical analysis of finite temperature transitions in atomic systems . in a way similar to the spectacular realizations obtained with superconducting josephson networks @xcite , arrays of becs can provide new experimentally realizable systems on which to test well known paradigms of the statistical mechanics : our interest here is to evidence how to detect a finite - temperature defect - mediated transition in @xmath0 optical lattice of becs .    according to the well - known mermin - wagner theorem @xcite , two - dimensional systems with a continuous symmetry can not sustain long - range order in the thermodynamic limit at finite temperature ; however , a phase transition is still possible and it occurs via the unbinding of point defects like dislocations or vortices .",
    "defect - mediated transitions are widely studied @xcite since they provide crucial insights for a wide variety of experiments on thin films .",
    "the bkt transition is the paradigmatic example of a defect - mediated transition @xcite which is exhibited by the two - dimensional @xmath1 model @xcite , describing @xmath5-components spins on a two - dimensional lattice . in the low - temperature phase , characterized by the presence of bound vortex - antivortex pairs , the spatial correlations exhibit a power - law decay ; above a critical temperature @xmath6 , the decay is exponential and there is a proliferation of free vortices . the bkt transition has been observed in superconducting josephson arrays @xcite and its predictions are well verified in the measurements of the superfluid density in @xmath7 films @xcite .    in finite magnetic systems",
    "the bkt transition point is signaled by the drop to @xmath8 of a suitably defined magnetization @xcite ; the existence of such a magnetization in finite systems does not contradict the mermin - wagner theorem , since the latter is valid only in the thermodynamic limit . in a large class of experimental situations ,",
    "the finite size @xmath1 model predicts magnetization exponents in agreement with the measurements carried out for layered magnets with planar spin symmetry @xcite .",
    "we shall show in the sequel that the fourier transform at @xmath2 of the condensates wavefunction provide the analogous of this magnetization for atomic systems , which are naturally finite ( since they are trapped by an harmonic potential ) .    in this paper",
    "we show that - at a critical temperature @xmath6 lower than the temperature @xmath9 at which condensation in each well occurs - @xmath0 lattices of becs may undergo a phase transition to a superfluid regime where the phases of the single - well condensates are coherently aligned allowing for the observation of a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition .",
    "we show in the following that the recently realized @xmath0 optical lattice of bose - einstein condensates @xcite may allow for the observation of a bkt transition in a finite bosonic system , since the thermodynamic properties of the bosonic lattice at finite temperature may be well described , in a suitable and experimentally attainable range of parameters , by the hamiltonian of the @xmath1 model .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that the transition we propose to observe is different from the quantum phase transition reported in @xcite , where the system is at @xmath10 and the insulator phase ( signaled by a reversible destruction of the phase coherence across the lattice ) is reached varying the optical lattice parameters : at variance , here , we propose to fix the system parameters in the superfluid phase and increase the temperature @xmath11 until the thermally induced vortex proliferation determines the bkt transition .",
    "we shall also show that the experimental signature of the bkt transition in bosonic planar lattices is obtained by measuring , as a function of the temperature , the central peak of the interference pattern of the expanding condensates released from the trap when the confining potentials are switched off .",
    "in fact , the peak of the momentum distribution at @xmath2 may be regarded as the magnetization of a finite size @xmath0 @xmath1 magnet , and , as shown in the following , it should exhibit a sharp decrease around @xmath6 . as a consequence ,",
    "also the central peak of the atomic density profile decreases around @xmath6 , signaling the occurrence of the bkt transition .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in section ii we discuss the hamiltonian describing a @xmath0 lattice of bose - einstein condensates at finite temperature and we show that - in a suitable range of parameters - the system is described by the @xmath1 hamiltonian . in section iii",
    "we show how the signature of the bkt transition may be evidenced in a bosonic planar lattice ; there we shall also discuss interesting analogies with superconducting josephson junction networks .",
    "section iv is devoted to our concluding remarks . in appendix",
    "a we report the details of a variational estimate of the coefficients of the hamiltonian describing @xmath4 , @xmath0 and @xmath3 optical lattices , while appendix b contains the analytical computation of the fourier transform of a vortex on a lattice .",
    "for @xmath0 optical lattices , when the polarization vectors of the two standing wave laser fields are orthogonal , the resulting periodic potential for the atoms is @xmath12   \\label{opt_potential_2d}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the wavevector of the laser beams .",
    "the potential maximum of a single standing wave , @xmath14 , may be controlled by changing the intensity of the optical lattice beams , and it is conveniently measured in units of the recoil energy @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the atomic mass ) , while , typically , @xmath17 can vary from @xmath8 up to @xmath18 ( gravity is assumed to act along the @xmath19-axis ) .",
    "usually , superimposed to the optical potential , there is an harmonic magnetic potential @xmath20 ,   \\label{magn_potential_2d}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is the axial ( radial ) trapping frequency .",
    "the minima of the @xmath0 periodic potential ( [ opt_potential_2d ] ) are located at the points @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 integers , and the potential around the minima is @xmath26 $ ] with @xmath27 providing the frequency of the wells .",
    "when @xmath28 , the system realizes a square array of tubes , i.e. an array of harmonic traps elongated along the @xmath19-axis @xcite .",
    "although the axial dynamics is very interesting in its own right @xcite , in the following we analyze only the situation in which the axial degrees of freedom are frozen out , which is realizable if @xmath21 is sufficiently large .",
    "we also assume that the harmonic oscillator length of the magnetic potential @xmath29 is larger than the size @xmath30 ( in lattice units ) of the optical lattice in order to reduce density inhomogeneity effects and to allow for a safe control of finite size effects .",
    "in addition , when all the relevant energy scales are small compared to the excitation energies one can safely expand the field operator @xcite as @xmath31 with @xmath32 the wannier wavefunction localized at the @xmath33-th well ( normalized to @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 the bosonic number operator . substituting the expansion in the full quantum hamiltonian describing the bosonic system , leads to the bose - hubbard model @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes a sum over nearest neighbours , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the @xmath17-wave scattering length ) and @xmath40 $ ] .    upon defining @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the average number of atoms per site ) , when @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the bose - hubbard model reduces to @xmath45 which describes the so - called quantum phase model ( see e.g. @xcite ) : in eq.([qpm ] ) @xmath46 is the phase of the @xmath47-th condensates and @xmath48 stands for the hamiltonian of the classical @xmath1 model . when @xmath49 and at temperatures @xmath50 , the pertinent partition function describing the thermodynamic behaviour of the becs stored in an optical lattice may be computed using the classical @xmath1 model ( [ x - y ] ) .",
    "the close relationship of the bose - hubbard model ( [ bhm ] ) and the quantum phase model ( [ qpm ] ) is by now well known @xcite and it has been widely used in the analysis of superconducting josephson networks ; since , in superconducting networks , @xmath42 is the average number of excess cooper pairs at a given site , the requirement @xmath43 is of course satisfied and the condition @xmath44 may also be easily realized for reasonable values of @xmath51 . at variance , in bosonic lattices @xmath42 varies usually between @xmath52 and @xmath53 and the validity of the mapping between the bose - hubbard model and the quantum phase hamiltonian is not always guaranteed ; furthermore , in order to get the @xmath1 model ( [ x - y ] ) from the bose - hubbard model ( [ bhm ] ) @xmath54 should be much smaller than @xmath51 , but not vanishing , in order to satisfy to the condition @xmath44 .",
    "of course the bose - hubbard model - for @xmath55 - describes harmonic oscillators and thus can not sustain any bkt transition ; nevertheless , when @xmath43 and @xmath56 , the bose - hubbard hamiltonian reduces in the @xmath1 model ( [ x - y ] ) , which _ do _ display the bkt transition .",
    "a simple estimate of the coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath54 may be obtained by approximating the wannier functions in eq.([tb ] ) with gaussians , whose widths are determined variationally .",
    "the details of the computation are reported in appendix a. in fig.1 we plot @xmath57 as a function of @xmath58 for a @xmath0 optical lattice ; for comparison , we plot the same ratio for @xmath4 and @xmath3 optical lattices also . since , in a mean - field approach , the mott insulator - superfluid transition occurs at @xmath10 approximately at @xmath59 @xcite ( @xmath19 is the number of nearest - neighbours ) , from fig.1 one sees that it is much easier to detect a quantum phase transition for the three - dimensional array ( and indeed it has been recently detected @xcite ) ; no quantum phase transition has yet been reported in literature for @xmath0 and @xmath4 optical lattices , since a larger laser power @xmath58 is required for its observation .    for a @xmath0 lattice with @xmath58 between @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( and @xmath62 as in @xcite ) , the conditions @xmath63 are rather well satisfied and the bkt critical temperature , @xmath64 , is between @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "since the bkt transition for the @xmath1 model occurs at a temperature @xmath64 , it should be possible to evidence the transition with measurements performed at different temperatures . using a coarse - graining approach to determine the finite - temperature phase - boundary line of the bose - hubbard model @xcite , yields , in @xmath0 and for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , a critical temperature @xmath69 , in reasonable agreement with the @xmath1 estimates of @xmath6",
    "; in addition , in the chosen range of parameters , the condition @xmath70 , satisfies the finite - temperature stability criterion recently derived by tsuchiya and griffin @xcite .",
    "we notice that the @xmath1 hamiltonian , in the limits @xmath67 and @xmath63 , can be also retrieved extending the gross - pitaevskii hamiltonian to finite temperature @xmath50 . replacing the tight - binding ansatz @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 are classical fields and not operators ) in the gross - pitaevskii hamiltonian one gets the lattice hamiltonian @xmath73 which is the classical version of the bose - hubbard model ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "writing @xmath75 , one may neglect the quadratic terms [ i.e. @xmath76 in the hopping part of the hamiltonian ( [ cbhm ] ) , which then reduces in the considered limit to @xmath77 ( [ x - y ] ) .",
    "accurate monte carlo simulations yield - for the @xmath1 model - the bkt critical temperature @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath79 , a bkt transition still occurs at a slightly lower critical temperature @xmath80 . intuitively speaking ,",
    "when @xmath54 increases , the superfluid region in the phase diagram decreases and , thus , one has @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the dependence of @xmath80 on @xmath54 obtained using a renormalization group approach has been reported in @xcite : when @xmath82 , but still @xmath83 , the only effect of the interacting term amounts to renormalize @xmath51 and to lower the bkt critical temperature @xcite .",
    "for this reason in the following we shall present results from monte carlo simulations of the classical @xmath1 model only .    in numerical simulations of the finite @xmath1 lattice",
    "one defines the critical temperature as the temperature @xmath84 at which the correlation length equals the size @xmath30 of the square lattice @xcite ; of course , as @xmath85 , @xmath86 . for @xmath87 ,",
    "the bkt transition is signaled in a finite system by the fact that a suitably defined magnetization , defined by eq.([m ] ) , drops to zero @xcite .",
    "the emerging physical picture is the following : there are two relevant temperatures for the system , the temperature @xmath9 , at which in each well there is a condensate , and the temperature @xmath6 at which the condensates phases start to coherently point in the same direction .",
    "of course , in order to have well defined condensates phases one should have @xmath88 . the critical temperature @xmath9 is given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 @xcite . with the numerical values given in @xcite , @xmath9 turns out to be @xmath91 for @xmath92 . when @xmath93 , the atoms in the well @xmath33 of the @xmath0 optical lattice may be described by a macroscopic wavefunction @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , when the fluctuations around the average number of atoms per site @xmath67 are strongly suppressed , one may put , apart from the factor @xmath94 constant across the array , @xmath95 .",
    "the temperature @xmath6 is of order of @xmath96 : with the experimental parameters of @xcite and @xmath58 between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , one has that @xmath6 is between @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which is sensibly smaller than the condensation temperature @xmath9 of the single well .",
    "a similar scenario describes also the phases of planar arrays of superconducting josephson junctions @xcite : they exhibit a temperature @xmath97 at which the metallic grains placed on the sites of the array become ( separately ) superconducting and the cooper pairs may be described by macroscopic wavefunctions . at a temperature @xmath98 ,",
    "the array undergo a bkt transition and the system - as a whole - becomes superconducting .",
    "in this section we shall evidence that the experimental signature of the bkt transition in bosonic planar lattices is obtained by measuring , as a function of the temperature , the central peak of the interference pattern obtained after turning off the confining potentials .",
    "firstly , we show that the peak of the momentum distribution at @xmath2 is the direct analog of the magnetization of a finite size @xmath0 @xmath1 magnet .",
    "in fact , for the @xmath1 magnets , the spins can be written as @xmath99 and the magnetization is defined as @xmath100 where @xmath101 stands for the thermal average ; a spin - wave analysis at low temperatures yields @xmath102 @xcite . with discrete becs at @xmath10 ,",
    "all the phases @xmath46 are equal at the equilibrium and the lattice fourier transform of @xmath103 , @xmath104 exhibits a peak at @xmath2 ( @xmath105 is in the first brillouin zone of the @xmath0 square lattice ) ; the magnetization is then @xmath106 the intuitive picture of the bkt transition is the following : at @xmath10 , all the spins point in the same direction .",
    "as one can see from fig.2(a ) , a single free vortex modifies the phase distribution far away from the vortex core and , thus , the modulus square of its lattice fourier transform @xmath107 has a minimum at @xmath2 . at variance , a vortex - antivortex pair [ see fig.2(b ) ] modifies the phase distribution only near the center of the pair ( in this sense is a local _ defect _ ) and its lattice fourier transform has a maximum at @xmath2 .",
    "analytical expressions for the lattice fourier transform @xmath108 of a single vortex and a vortex - antivortex pair may be worked out in detail and are reported in the appendix b.    upon increasing the temperature , vortices are thermally induced .",
    "for @xmath109 only bound vortex pairs are present , and on average the spins continue to point in the same direction .",
    "when the condensates expand , a large peak ( i.e. , a magnetization ) is observed in the central @xmath2 momentum component , as shown in fig.2(c ) .",
    "rising further the temperature , due to the increasing number of vortex pairs , the central peak density decreases . for @xmath110 ,",
    "the pairs start to unbind and free vortices begin to appear [ see fig.2(d ) ] , determining a sharp decrease around @xmath6 of the magnetization . at high temperatures ,",
    "only free vortices are present , leading to a randomization of the phases and to a vanishing magnetization . in fig.3",
    "we plot the intensity of the central peak of the momentum distribution ( normalized to the value at @xmath10 ) in a 2d lattice as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath111 , evidencing the sharp decrease of the magnetization around the bkt critical temperature .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the interference patterns of the expanding condensates : after the bosonic system reaches the equilibrium , one may switch off both the harmonic trap and the optical lattice . at this time ( @xmath112 )",
    "the momentum distribution @xmath113 is given by the fourier transform of @xmath114 : one finds @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the fourier transform of the @xmath3 wannier functions and @xmath117 is the momentum projection on the first brillouin zone of the @xmath0 optical lattice . using a gaussian for the wannier functions , @xmath118 ( with @xmath119 , since @xmath120 )",
    ", one has @xmath121 , where @xmath122 and similarly for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "since for @xmath125 @xmath126 , the momentum distribution exhibits well pronounced peaks in the centers of each brillouin zone : these peaks have different heights and the central @xmath2 peak is the largest ( see figs.2 and 3 of @xcite ) .    at @xmath112 the amplitude of the @xmath2 peak of the momentum distribution",
    "is simply given by the thermal average of @xmath127 . by measuring the @xmath2 peak",
    "( i.e. , @xmath128 ) at different temperatures , one obtains the results plotted in fig.2 .",
    "the figure has been obtained using a monte carlo simulation of the @xmath1 magnet for a @xmath129 array : we find @xmath130 . in fig.2",
    "we also plot the low - temperature spin wave prediction @xcite ( solid line ) , as well as a fit , first used in @xcite , valid near @xmath131 and derived form the renormalization group equations ( dotted line ) . at times different from @xmath112 ,",
    "the density profiles are well reproduced by the free expansion of the ideal gas : one obtains @xmath132/6m^2g\\hbar } \\tilde{\\varphi}(p_x , p_y , t)$ ] , i.e. a uniformly accelerating motion along @xmath19 and a free motion in the @xmath133 plane , with @xmath134 giving the central and lateral peaks of the momentum distribution as a function of time for different temperatures .",
    "an intense experimental work is now focusing on the bose - einstein condensation in two dimensions : at present a crossover to two - dimensional behaviour has been observed for @xmath135 @xcite and @xmath136 atoms @xcite .",
    "our analysis relies on two basic assumptions ; namely , the validity of the tight - binding approximation for the bose - hubbard hamiltonian and the requirement that the condensate in the optical lattice may be regarded as planar @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that the first assumption is satisfied if , at @xmath10 , @xmath137 ( where @xmath138 is the chemical potential ) , and , at finite temperature , @xmath139 .",
    "the second assumption is much more restrictive since it requires freezing the transverse excitations ; for this to happen one should require a condition on the transverse trapping frequency @xmath21 .",
    "namely , one should have that , at @xmath10 , @xmath140 and that , at finite temperature , @xmath141 ( since @xmath142 , the latter condition also implies that @xmath143 ) . in @xcite",
    "it is @xmath144 and , for @xmath92 , the tight - binding conditions are satisfied since @xmath145 ; furthermore , if @xmath146 , one may safely regard our finite temperature analysis to be valid at least up to @xmath147 .",
    "we notice that the experimental signature for the bkt transition for a continuous ( i.e. , without optical lattice ) weakly interacting 2d bose gas @xcite is also given by the central peak of the atomic density of the expanding condensates .",
    "our paper analyzes the finite - temperature phase transitions in @xmath0 lattices of becs .",
    "our study evidences the possibility that bose - einstein condensates loaded on a @xmath0 optical lattice may exhibit - at finite temperature - a new coherent behaviour in which all the phases of the condensates located in each well of the lattice point in the same direction . the finite - temperature transition , which is due to the thermal atoms in each well , is mediated by vortex defects and may be experimentally detectable by looking at the interference patterns of the expanding condensates .",
    "our analysis relies on the approximation that the effect of the shallow confining harmonic trap in the @xmath133 plane may be neglected : for a tight confinement , we expect that interesting mesoscopic effects will come to play , affecting the bkt transition .",
    "we observe that for a @xmath3 optical lattice ( resulting form the potential @xmath148 $ ] ) with @xmath149 , the system maps on the @xmath3 @xmath1 model , which is the prototype of the universality class including the @xmath150 normal - superfluid transition in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "also in this case , the central peak of the interference pattern tends to zero at the critical temperature , fig.4 .",
    "we recall , however , that the @xmath3 transition is a simple order - disorder transition ( whose critical temperature @xmath151 is given in the thermodynamic limit by @xmath152 @xcite ) , and is not mediated by the creation of vortices - antivortices pairs as in the 2d case . a natural question arising from the comparison of figs.3 and 4 is how to clearly characterize the two transitions : to answer , one may observe that the critical exponent @xmath153 ( defined by @xmath154 ) is @xmath155 for the @xmath0 @xmath1 universality class @xcite and @xmath156 for the @xmath3 @xmath1 universality class @xcite .    in conclusion",

    "in this appendix we set the origin @xmath234 of the coordinates in the center of the central plaquette : setting to @xmath34 the lattice length , the lattice sites are labeled by @xmath235 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 positive and negative _ odd _ integer numbers .    the phase distribution of a vortex is depicted in fig.2(a ) and is such that @xmath46 equals the polar angle @xmath236 with respect to the origin @xmath234 ( e.g. , at the site @xmath237 @xmath46 equals @xmath238 , at the site @xmath239 is @xmath240 , and so on ; an antivortex would be characterized by @xmath241 ) . for future convenience",
    ", we shall label the site @xmath242 with the index @xmath243 : as a consequence , the four sites @xmath237 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , and @xmath237 of the central plaquette will be associated to @xmath246 ; the eight sites @xmath239 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 will be associated to @xmath250 . in other words ,",

    "if , for simplicity , one considers only sites with @xmath251 going from @xmath34 to a maximum value @xmath254 , then the total number of sites is @xmath255    to evaluate the lattice fourier transform ( [ ft_app ] ) , one may conveniently separate the sum @xmath256 in @xmath257 sums over sites having the same index @xmath251 ; for instance , for the four sites @xmath237 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , and @xmath237 of the central plaquette , one gets @xmath258 \\label{sum_elle_1}\\ ] ] where @xmath259 and the sum is restricted only to the sites having @xmath246 . a straightforward generalization of eq.([sum_elle_1 ] )",
    "shows that for the sum on the @xmath253 sites having a fixed @xmath251 one has",
    "@xmath260 @xmath261 \\label{sum_elle}\\ ] ] where @xmath262 } \\label{theta_m_n}\\ ] ] is an angle taking values between @xmath8 and @xmath263 .      if in eq.([ft_an ] ) one puts @xmath265 , one gets @xmath266 by introducing the index @xmath267 and rearranging conveniently the partial sums in eq.([ft_an_simpl1 ] ) one obtains @xmath268 with @xmath269 eq.([ft_an_simpl2 ] ) clearly shows that for @xmath270 one has @xmath271 : of course , with a single vortex , the magnetization ( [ m ] ) is zero ; furthermore , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath272 , @xmath273 , in agreement the mermin - wagner theorem .",
