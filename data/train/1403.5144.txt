    "the split ring resonator ( srr ) initially proposed by pendry in 1999 @xcite has been widely analyzed because of its small electrical size and strong magnetic polarizability at resonance which makes it a proper unit cell of metamaterial .",
    "for instance , the srr joint to a metallic wire was used as the unit cell of the first experimental demonstration of a left - handed metamaterial by david smith and co - workers in 2000 @xcite .",
    "after , particles showing similar behavior , like spiral resonators of two turns ( sr2 ) @xcite , have been also considered in order to reduce the electrical size of the unit cell .",
    "main properties of these type of resonators can be approached by relatively easy lc - circuit models where the circuit parameters may be fully obtained from geometrical dimensions and material properties . in the case of infinitely",
    "thin resonators , readers could find some designer formulas in @xcite for several different topologies .",
    "however , this calculations were only done for extremely thin resonator but some times it is interesting to manufacture thick structures in order to make the q - factor higher .    in this paper",
    "a generalization of the lc - circuit model for thick resonators is presented .",
    "for instance , this model may be helpful for designing thick frequency selective surfaces ( fss ) with high quality factor based on these types of resonators , also known as metasurfaces .",
    "namely , along this paper , we focus our attention on thick particles with transverse shape of srr and sr2 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "7.5 mm and @xmath01 mm . ]",
    "as the thickness @xmath1 is increased , although the induced current is spread along the @xmath2 direction , numerical simulations indicate that its profile on plane @xmath3 approximately remains .",
    "simulations also shows that near the borders of the metal strips the surface current diverges , so that it could be properly approximated by a maxwellian distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the inductance can be approached to that of a thin hollow metal cylinder of average radius @xmath4 .",
    "the inductance of this ideal cylinder can be approximated by using the variational expression @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the magnetic energy . assuming a maxwellian distribution of the surface current density along the @xmath2 direction",
    ", we can get the following expression @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the surface current density at @xmath9 .",
    "the integration of ( 1 ) gives the current @xmath10 on the other hand , the magnetic energy is @xmath11 where the potential vector @xmath12 can be calculated from the laplace equation in cylindrical coordinates and corresponding boundary conditions : @xmath13 using fourier transforms for the surface current density and vector potential , equation ( [ laplace ] ) turns into the bessel equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the solution of this equation is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the modified bessel functions .",
    "once the potential vector and the surface current are known , the variational expression @xmath5 can be used to get @xmath19          in a first order approximation , the capacitance could be calculated by using the well known formula for the capacitance of a long cylindrical capacitor : @xmath20 where @xmath1 is the height or thickness , @xmath21 distance between the two coaxial cylinders , and @xmath22 the permittivity filling the space between the cylinders . however , for relatively small @xmath1 the fringing effect should not be neglected .",
    "we assume that the fringing electric field is similar to the field created by two coplanar extremely thin rings with the same shape of the transversal section of the cylindrical capacitor .",
    "the fringing capacitance may be approximated by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 represents the capacitance per unit of length of two parallel coplanar strips @xcite .",
    "considering that the two halves of the srr are connected in series , the resonance frequency of its equivalent circuit is @xmath25 . on the other hand , the capacitance of the thick sr2 must be 4 times bigger , since the two halves are connected in parallel , i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the resonance frequency of sr2 is half the value for srr , which means that the electrical size of the former is smaller than that of the last .",
    "in order to check the validity of the model , many numerical simulations were carried out by using the frequency domain solver of _ cst microwave studio_. all particles were made of perfect electric conductor in free space .",
    "the geometrical parameters on the transverse @xmath3-plane were held constant and equal to the values indicated in caption of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the resonance frequency has been plotted against the thickness @xmath1 varying within the range 0 - 12 mm .",
    "this figure is also showing the values coming from the lc equivalent circuit model .",
    "for most part , the agreement between model is good .",
    "the disagreement observed for thin particles can be attributed to the fact that the approximation of l for a cylinder of infinitely thin metal is not longer valid , since @xmath1 start to be comparable to @xmath27 or @xmath21 .    besides , it is remarkable that the ratio of 2 between the resonance frequencies of thin srr and sr2 , which was previously reported @xcite , is still obtained for thick particles .",
    "calculated by means of the lc - circuit model and full - wave simulations by using _",
    "cst microwave studio_. ]",
    "a circuit model for calculating the resonance frequency of thick srr and sr2 has been proposed and checked by means of numerical simulations . besides , it was shown that the ratio between the resonance frequency of the srr and the sr2 is independent of the thickness and approximately equal to 2 , similarly to the case of thin particles @xcite .",
    "this analytical model can be useful for designing thick fss with higher q - factor than that of thin particles .",
