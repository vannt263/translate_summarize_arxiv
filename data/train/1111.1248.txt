    "the first pulsar catalog released by _ fermi",
    "_ large area telescope ( lat ) included  46 pulsars @xcite , 8 of which were millisecond pulsars ( msps )  @xcite . currently , there are @xmath2 msps  @xcite and @xmath3 pulsars in total  @xcite",
    ". the discovery of @xcite revealed it to be the first msp to have ( nearly ) phase - aligned radio and light curves ( lcs ) .",
    "this rare phenomenon has only been observed for the crab pulsar  @xcite .",
    "however , this behavior has now also been observed for ( b1937 + 21 ) , ( b1957 + 20 )  @xcite , and @xcite , and more msps will be added to this subclass .",
    "two classes of pulsar models have been used to describe high - energy ( he ) pulsar emission . in polar cap ( pc )",
    "models  @xcite , primary electrons are ejected from the neutron star ( ns ) surface and accelerated along curved magnetic field lines , producing curvature radiation gamma rays .",
    "thermal x - rays may also be upscattered to energies .",
    "subsequently , these gamma rays are converted into electron - positron pairs via magnetic pair production in the intense magnetic fields close to the stellar surface ( at radius @xmath4 ) .",
    "in addition , a slot gap ( sg ) @xcite may form along the last open magnetic field lines of the pulsar magnetosphere in the absence of pair creation along those lines .",
    "this corresponds to a two - pole caustic ( tpc ) geometry @xcite which may extend from the stellar surface up to near the light cylinder ( at radius @xmath0 ) .",
    "outer gap ( og ) models @xcite represent the second model class . in these models , he radiation is produced along the last open field lines above the null charge surface ( ncs ) where the goldreich - julian charge density changes sign .",
    "the narrow gaps in both the og and tpc models require screening of the electric field parallel to the local magnetic field , and therefore presupposes copious pair production .",
    "lastly , he lcs were also modeled in the context of og and tpc models in a force - free magnetic field geometry , proposing a separatrix layer model close to @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "he photons escaping from the magnetosphere are subject to two relativistic effects : their traveling direction is aberrated due to the large corotation velocity , while their arrival time at the observer is determined by their emission height , due to the finite speed of light .",
    "lastly , it is assumed that these photons are emitted tangent to the local magnetic field lines in the co - rotating frame .",
    "the combination of these three effects result in the formation of caustics , i.e. , the accumulation of photons in narrow phase bands  @xcite .",
    "these caustics manifest themselves as bright peaks in the observed pulse profiles .      due to their much lower surface dipole magnetic field strengths , msps have been thought to have pair - starved magnetospheres , where the magnetic pair multiplicity is not high enough to screen the accelerating electric field in the open volume above the pc  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "primary electrons are accelerated up to very high altitudes above the full pc , while pair formation is suppressed .",
    "this model is called the pair - starved polar cap ( pspc ) model  @xcite , an extension of the traditional pc model .",
    "msp lcs and spectra have been modeled using this framework  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , msp spectra and energetics have also been modeled in the context of an og model @xcite .",
    "an annular gap model  @xcite can furthermore reproduce the main characteristics of the lcs of three msps , although this model does not attempt to model the nonzero phase offsets between the and radio profiles .",
    "the first  8 _ fermi_-detected msps have been modeled  @xcite .",
    "two distinct msp subclasses were found : those whose lcs are well fit by a standard og or tpc model , and those whose lcs are well fit by a pspc model ( with these fits being mutually exclusive ) . these models yielded",
    "the correct radio - to - gamma phase lags when the radio emission was modeled as a cone beam at lower altitude .",
    "such fits implied that msps have screened magnetospheres with large amounts of pairs available , as these conditions are needed to set up the gap structure presupposed by the og / tpc models .",
    "small distortions of the dipole magnetic field causing offsets of the pc may provide a mechanism for enhancing pair creation , even in low - spin - down pulsars  @xcite . this paper discusses a third sublcass of msps : those having phase - aligned radio and lcs .",
    "in contrast to the first two msp sublcasses , the near phase - alignment of the and radio lcs of msps in the third subclass argues for overlapping emission regions .",
    "these co - located emission regions may occur at high altitudes , so that the radio emission will be subject to the same relativistic effects as the emission , as described in section  [ sec : caustics ] .",
    "discoveries of new msps exhibiting phase - aligned lcs therefore motivate the investigation of high - altitude  @xcite caustic radio emission .    a second argument",
    "motivating caustic radio emission comes from investigating the beaming properties of normal pulsars and msps detectable using blind searches on data as well as radio data  @xcite .",
    "the relative number of to radio pulsars for each of these ` gamma - ray - selected ' and ` radio - selected ' samples implies that radio and beams must have comparable sky coverage of @xmath5  sr for pulsars with high spin - down luminosities ( @xmath6 ) , but radio beams should shrink for pulsars having lower values of @xmath6 . the radio emission for high-@xmath6 pulsars should therefore originate in wide beams at a significant fraction of @xmath0 .",
    "one should however bear in mind that lcs resulting from radio and caustics would generally be nearly phase - aligned ( although small phase differences could result if the radio and emission regions are at different altitudes ) .",
    "caustic radio emission is therefore plausible for young pulsars with nearly aligned lcs .",
    "radio caustics may however be more common in the case of the msps , as there are many more examples of msps with phase - aligned lcs .",
    "we investigate the possibility of reproducing phase - aligned radio and lcs using `` altitude - limited '' og / tpc models ( alog / altpc ) in which we limit the extent of the emission regions ( section  [ sec : alt - lim ] ) vs.  a low - altitude sg ( lasg ) model ( section  [ sec : lasg ] ) . by modeling the lcs of and we can infer values for the magnetic inclination and observer angles @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( section  [ sec : results ] ) , and also constrain the emission altitudes .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    was discovered using the parkes radio telescope  @xcite .",
    "it follows a circular orbit around a low - mass companion ( _ hubble space telescope _",
    "observations revealed an optical white dwarf companion with a mass of about @xmath9 ; @xcite ) .",
    "s period of @xmath10  ms implies a rotational age of @xmath11  gyr , dipolar surface field of @xmath12  g , and spin - down power of @xmath13  erg s@xmath14 @xcite , typical among the radio msp population .",
    "it is also relatively close , lying at 0.5  kpc @xcite .",
    "no rotating vector model ( rvm ) fits exist for @xcite because there is no detected linear polarization .",
    "a @xmath15 detection of an x - ray source 0.2@xmath16 from the pulsar position by _ xmm - newton _ was reported  @xcite , while _ egret _ obtained a @xmath17 flux upper limit above 100  mev @xcite exceeding the recent _ fermi _ flux measurements @xcite by an order of magnitude .",
    "is the first msp ever discovered  @xcite .",
    "it has a period @xmath18  ms , and remains one of the fastest - spinning msps discovered .",
    "this msp has a very high spin - down luminosity of @xmath19  erg s@xmath14 , surface magnetic field of @xmath20  g , and characteristic age of @xmath21  gyr  @xcite , and lies at a distance of @xmath22  kpc @xcite .",
    "_ rxte _ observations @xcite revealed a double - peaked x - ray profile with phase separation of about half a rotation , closely aligned with the phases of the giant radio pulses  @xcite , but slightly lagging the radio peaks .",
    "the _ egret _ @xmath17 upper limit to the unpulsed flux above 100  mev was @xmath23  cm  s@xmath14  @xcite .",
    "pulsations with a significance well above @xmath24 have now been detected from by _ fermi _ lat  @xcite .",
    "was the first `` black widow '' pulsar discovered .",
    "it is in a nearly circular eclipsing binary orbit , ablating its low - mass tidally - locked companion star  @xcite .",
    "lying at a distance of @xmath25  kpc , its period @xmath26  ms and intrinsic @xmath27 is @xmath28  @xcite lead to a spin - down luminosity of @xmath29  erg s@xmath14 , surface magnetic field of @xmath12  g , and characteristic age of @xmath30  gyr .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations revealed a phase dependence of the x - ray emission on the binary orbital period  @xcite , although no pulsations were detected at the pulsar spin period @xmath31 .",
    "a @xmath32 pulsed x - ray signal have now been observed from with the x - ray peaks seemingly in close alignment with the radio peaks @xcite .",
    "significant pulsed emission has also been detected by _",
    "lat @xcite .",
    "as in in our previous work  @xcite , we assumed a retarded vacuum dipole magnetic field as the basic structure of the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite . in the case of young pulsars",
    ", this field may actually be closer to the force - free solution  @xcite , but it is not clear whether msps produce enough pairs to facilitate a force - free magnetosphere .",
    "we furthermore use a photon emission rate that is constant along magnetic field lines in the corotating frame , and treat relativistic effects ( i.e. , aberration of photon directions and time - of - flight delays ; section  [ sec : caustics ] ) consistently to first order in @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 the radial distance from the ns center ) .",
    "we lastly include the lorentz transformation ( a second - order effect in @xmath33 ) of the local magnetic field between lab and corotating frames  @xcite .",
    "we use the same framework as previously  @xcite , but the radio emission region is extended in altitude .",
    "we free the minimum and maximum radii of the radio ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) and the maximum radius of the ( @xmath37 ) emission regions , and restrict the emission gaps extent to a cylindrical radius @xmath38 .",
    "importantly , we do not use an axis - centered radio conal model , but investigate radio photons coming from an og / tpc - like structure . in the alog radio models , the minimum radius is actually @xmath39 , so it is a function of magnetic azimuth @xmath40 and co - latitude @xmath41 when @xmath42 . here , @xmath43 is the radius of the ncs .",
    "we always set @xmath44 for altpc ( and tpc ) and @xmath45 for alog ( and alog ) fits , while @xmath35 may vary and may even be quite close to @xmath0 .",
    "our alog and altpc models have  9 and  8 free parameters respectively , describing the pulsar geometry ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) and and radio gap locations , apart from @xmath31 which determines the size of the pc ( see figure  [ fig : emission_layers ] ) .",
    "more details are provided in  @xcite .",
    "note that the radio and emission layers are fit independently .",
    ", and the spin axis by @xmath46 .",
    "the two concentric circles indicate the limiting minimum and maximum emission radii imposed for the altitude - limited models.,width=302 ]      this model provides a non - caustic explanation for the emission , and may be viewed as a geometric low - altitude sg model  @xcite resembling a hollow cone beam close to the stellar surface .",
    "we modulate the emissivity according to @xmath47 with @xmath48 the distance above the ns surface along a magnetic field line , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 setting the rate at which the intensity rises and falls along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the peak intensity occurs at a distance @xmath52 ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) along the field lines .",
    "the lasg models have  5 free parameters ( more details in @xcite ) .",
    "in order to statistically pick the best - fit parameters , for the alog and altpc models and for the three msps considered here , we have developed an markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) maximum likelihood procedure  @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray lcs are fit using poisson likelihood while the radio lcs are fit using a @xmath54 statistic , and the two values are then combined . for a given parameter state",
    "the likelihood value is calculated by independently optimizing the radio and model normalizations using the _ scipy _ python module and the _ scipy.optimize.fmin_l_fbgs_b _ multivariate , bound optimizer  @xcite .",
    "an mcmc involves taking random steps in parameter space and accepting a step based on the likelihood ratio with respect to the previous step  @xcite .",
    "the likelihood surfaces can be very multimodal which can lead to poor mixing of the chain and slow convergence .",
    "therefore , we have implemented small - world chain steps @xcite and simulated annealing @xcite to speed up the convergence and ensure that the mcmc fully explores the parameter space and does not get stuck in a local maximum .",
    "we verify that our chains have converged using the criteria proposed by @xcite .    in order to balance the gamma - ray and radio contributions to the likelihood",
    ", we have chosen to use a radio uncertainty which is equal to the average relative uncertainty in the on - peak region times the maximum radio value .",
    "the choice of radio uncertainty can strongly affect the best - fit results ; in particular , a smaller uncertainty will decrease the overall likelihood and can , in some cases , lead to a different best - fit geometry which favors the radio lc more strongly . when varying the radio uncertainty by a factor of  2 , the best - fit @xmath7 and @xmath8 values of were found to change by @xmath55 .",
    "for the best - fit @xmath7 and @xmath8 were found to vary by @xmath56 when varying the radio uncertainty .",
    "the best - fit geometry of was found to be the most sensitive to changes in the radio uncertainty , with either the best - fit @xmath7 or @xmath8 value changing by @xmath57 , while the other parameter changed by @xmath58 .",
    "starting from the best - fit parameters found by the mcmc , we produced confidence contours in @xmath7 and @xmath8 by performing likelihood profile scans over the other parameters , allowing for the possibility of finding a better fit .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath7 and @xmath8 quoted in table  [ tab2 ] are approximate 95% confidence level uncertainties .",
    "we can also estimate uncertainties on the emission altitude parameters using the information from the likelihood profile scans which generated the confidence contours .",
    "note that we used manually - selected lc fits for the lasg models .",
    "the effects of letting @xmath59 and @xmath60 be free parameters in the alog / altpc model context , as well as using different fading parameters in our lasg models is discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "our best - fit lc parameters are summarized in table  [ tab2 ] . as an example , the alog / altpc lc fits for are shown in figure  [ fig : j0034_lim ] , while figure  [ fig : pc_j0034 ] shows fits for in the case of lasg models .",
    "for both and radio lcs , as the data and model zero phases do not coincide .",
    "this implies that the definition of ` leading peak ' and ` first peak ' do not coincide anymore .",
    "see table  [ tab2 ] for more details.,width=302 ]    we studied a third subclass of msp lcs for which the and radio profiles are phase - aligned , and the and radio emission should therefore be co - located .",
    "we introduced free parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the alog / altpc models , ( both are free for the radio emission region , but only @xmath37 is free for the the emission region ) and found fits from these models which could reproduce the salient features of the profiles , although not perfectly . as a second option",
    ", we implemented the the lasg models and demonstrated that a modulated emissivity at low altitudes can reproduce main features of the profiles quite well .    at the moment",
    ", it is difficult to quantitatively favor one class of models above the other , since searching for optimal lasg lc fits has been done manually .",
    "however , we did calculate the likelihood of the best - fit lasg lcs .",
    "the altpc models provide slightly better lc fits than the alog models , and both of these give better fits than the lasg models for the parameters listed ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) . favoring the alog / altpc models over the lasg model therefore implies that the phase - aligned and radio lcs are most probably of caustic origin , produced in the outer magnetosphere , and the radio emission is most likely originating near the light cylinder .",
    "thus , we can now divide the msp population into three subclasses on the basis of their lcs : those with lcs fit by standard og / tpc models , those with phase - aligned lcs fit by alog / altpc or lasg models , and those with lcs fit by pspc models .",
    "radio polarization measurements can be used to give independent constraints on the pulsar viewing geometry @xcite , complementing the model fits , although the traditional rvm @xcite is not valid for the altpc or alog models where the radio peaks are caustics .",
    "furthermore , the rvm is not expected to yield good results in the case of radio cone beam emission in msps , as these beams should suffer significant distortions due to retardation and aberration  @xcite .",
    "this may account for the generally poor or non - existent rvm fits of msp polarization data .",
    "caustic models predict rapid pa swings coupled with depolarization  @xcite , since although the emission originates from a large range of altitudes and magnetic field orientations , it is restricted to a narrow phase interval to form the peaks .",
    "these features seem to be present in radio polarization measurements of the modeled msps  @xcite .",
    "polarization signatures are important to help discriminate between models with caustic emission ( such as occurs in alog / altpc models ) and non - caustic emission ( e.g. , in the lasg model ) .",
    "future studies include development of full radiation models which will be able to reproduce the multiwavelength lc shapes , polarization properties , as well as the energy - dependent behavior of the spectra of the msps .",
    "ways to increase pair production also need to be found , which may include investigation of offset - pc dipole magnetic fields  @xcite and higher - multipole magnetic fields near the ns surface  @xcite .",

    "<S> alternatively , there also exist phase - aligned lc solutions for emission originating near the stellar surface in a slot gap ( sg ) scenario ( `` low - altitude slot gap '' ( lasg ) models ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find best - fit lcs using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) maximum likelihood approach  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our fits imply that the phase - aligned lcs are likely of caustic origin , produced in the outer magnetosphere , and that the radio emission may come from close to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we lastly constrain the emission altitudes with typical uncertainties of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our results describe a third gamma - ray msp subclass , in addition to the two ( with non - aligned lcs ) previously found  @xcite : those with lcs fit by standard og / tpc models , and those with lcs fit by pair - starved polar cap ( pspc ) models . </S>"
