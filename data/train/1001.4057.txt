    "the nonsupersymmetric dark left - right model ( dlrm ) proposed recently @xcite is a variant of a supersymmetric left - right extension of the standard model ( sm ) of particle interactions based on @xmath12 and inspired by string theory some 23 years ago @xcite .",
    "it has a number of desirable properties , the chief of which is the absence of tree - level flavor - changing neutral currents , thus allowing the @xmath10 breaking scale to be as low as experimentally allowed by collider data .",
    "this became known in the literature as the alternative left - right model ( alrm ) @xcite . here",
    "we explore further consequences of the dlrm , coming from the @xmath10 sector .",
    "consider the gauge group @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a global symmetry such that the breaking of @xmath15 will leave the combination @xmath16 unbroken .",
    "this allows @xmath17 to be a generalized lepton number which is conserved @xcite in all interactions except those which are responsible for majorana neutrino masses .",
    "the fermion content of the dlrm is given by @xmath18 this basic structure was already known many years ago @xcite but without realizing that @xmath7 is a scotino , i.e. a dark - matter fermion .",
    "the scalar sector of the dlrm consists of one bidoublet and two doublets : @xmath19 as well as two triplets for making @xmath20 and @xmath7 massive separately : @xmath21 their assignments under @xmath14 are listed in table i.    .scalar content of proposed model . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the special case where @xmath22 , which is allowed in part of the parameter space shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot - mass ] , and assuming that @xmath23 as well , we will have the spectacular decay chain @xmath24 , resulting in 8 charged muons as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zprimedecay ] .",
    ", width=226 ]    this branching fraction is of order 20 percent , given the fact that both @xmath25 and @xmath26 decay predominantly into @xmath27 , and the dominant decay mode of @xmath28 is into two charged muons . in other parts of the parameter space ,",
    "the decay @xmath29 is kinematically forbidden , but the branching fraction for @xmath30 is still substantial , yielding 4 muons in the final state .    in the above",
    ", we have assumed that the @xmath31 scalar triplet couples only to muons .",
    "this means that the corresponding scotino @xmath32 is part of the @xmath10 doublet @xmath33 with @xmath34 gev . if @xmath31 couples to electrons , then @xmath35 scattering through @xmath28 exchange would be much too big to be consistent with known data .",
    "we also assume no flavor mixing , i.e. @xmath31 does not couple to @xmath36 for example , or lepton flavor violating processes such as @xmath37 and @xmath38 would be too big .",
    "however , @xmath31 still contributes to the muon anomalous magnetic moment which turns out to have the magnitude of the experimental discrepancy but of the wrong sign .",
    "to remedy this situation , one possibility is to add @xmath39 fermion doublets @xmath40 with @xmath41 and a neutral scalar singlet @xmath42 of @xmath43 .",
    "the interaction @xmath44 will contribute positively and compensate for @xmath31 .",
    "one final complication is that @xmath45 should have a mass greater than @xmath32 in order that @xmath32 is dark matter .",
    "since it can not come from @xmath31 , @xmath45 must have a dirac mass partner , i.e. an @xmath46 singlet .",
    "of course , we can avoid all constraints by considering @xmath47 instead as the scotino , in which case @xmath48 will decay into @xmath49",
    ". the resulting experimental signature would then be much more difficult to pick out .",
    "we have explored the possible phenomenology of an unconventional @xmath10 model at the tev scale called the dark left - right model ( dlrm )  @xcite .",
    "the scalar sector associated with the @xmath10 gauge group has been studied in detail , including its mass spectrum and its most relevant signature , namely , the decay of the doubly charged scalar into same - sign dileptons : @xmath50 . from the requirement of dark - matter relic abundance that the @xmath10 scalar triplet must be relatively light , we find that the @xmath51 of this model should decay into them with large branching fractions",
    ". in particular , @xmath52 will yield 4 charged muons , with 1.3 times the event rate of @xmath53 directly . more spectacularly ,",
    "if kinematically allowed , @xmath25 and @xmath26 will decay into @xmath54 as well , so that @xmath55 will yield 8 charged muons , with 7.9 times the event rate of @xmath53 . since a modest luminosity of 0.2 fb@xmath56 at the lhc will produce 10 dimuon events from this @xmath51 with @xmath57 tev , the predicted events with 4 muons and 8 muons",
    "will be clear signals of our proposal .",
