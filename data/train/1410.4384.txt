    "the li criterion for the riemann hypothesis , proved in @xcite is a simple positivity criterion stating that the riemann hypothesis is equivalent to non - negativity of a certain sequence of real numbers , called the li coefficients .",

    "it is proved that non - negativity of @xmath15 for all positive integers @xmath7 is equivalent to the statement that all non - trivial zeros of @xmath16 are in the strip @xmath17 .",
    "we will refer to this criterion as @xmath0li criterion .",
    "it is a generalization of the li criterion in the sense that non - negativity of @xmath18 is equivalent to the statement that all non - trivial zeros of @xmath12 are on the critical line @xmath19 , i.e. non - negativity of @xmath18 is equivalent to the generalized riemann hypothesis for @xmath12 .",
    "however , for @xmath20 the @xmath0li criterion is a weaker statement , as it produces only zero - free regions .",
    "the @xmath0li criterion for the rankin - selberg @xmath2functions and asymptotic behavior of coefficients @xmath8 was deduced in @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of investigation conducted in this paper is to define @xmath0li coefficients for a very broad class of @xmath2functions , we denote by @xmath21 , prove the @xmath0li criterion for this class , derive an arithmetic formula for the computation of @xmath0li coefficients and investigate analytically and numerically the properties of @xmath0li coefficients .",
    "the class @xmath22 consists of all dirichlet series @xmath12 converging in some half - plane @xmath23 , such that the meromorphic continuation of @xmath12 to @xmath24 is a meromorphic function of a finite order with at most finitely many poles , satisfying a functional equation relating values @xmath25 with @xmath26 up to multiplicative gamma factors and such that the logarithmic derivative @xmath27 has a dirichlet series representation converging in the half plane @xmath28 .",

    "another reason why we introduce the class @xmath1 lies in the fact that , as proved in theorem [ thm : tau li implies li ] below , for @xmath16 and an arbitrary positive real number @xmath32 the @xmath0li criterion for the function @xmath33 ( that belongs to the class @xmath34 and does not belong to @xmath31 ) with @xmath35 is equivalent to the generalized riemann hypothesis for @xmath12 . on the other hand ,",
    "as proved in theorem [ thm : arithmetic f - la 1 ] the @xmath0li coefficients for @xmath35 may be expressed in terms of a sum of derivatives of digamma functions , certain finite sums and a rapidly converging dirichlet series ( for large values of @xmath36 ) , an expression that is suitable both for analytic considerations and numerical computations since the sum of derivatives of digamma functions may be easily estimated up to an error term @xmath37 , for an arbitrary positive integer @xmath38 ( see e.g. computations in @xcite , section 6 ) .",
    "let us note that for @xmath16 the @xmath0li criterion for @xmath39 is equivalent to the generalized riemann hypothesis , however , in this case an arithmetic expression for the li coefficients is far from being rapidly converging , see theorem 6.1 . and theorem 6.2 . from @xcite .",
