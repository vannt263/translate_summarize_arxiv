    "at the end of their lives , stars of approximately solar - mass ( 0.88  m@xmath9 ) ascend the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , the final phase of nuclear burning in the lives of these stars .",
    "the agb is one of the brightest populations in the infrared ( ir ) sky , contributing up to @xmath02030% of the ir light for the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) @xcite .",
    "essentially all agb stars are variables @xcite , with periods on the order of hundreds of days .",
    "this variability is caused by hydrodynamic pulsations traveling through the extended atmosphere of the star .",
    "the dramatic changes in stellar radius these shocks produce cause brightness fluctuations on the scale of @xmath02  mag ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , on time scales of hundreds of days @xcite . on much longer time scales ( @xmath010@xmath10  yr ) , runaway thermonuclear reactions in the helium burning shell of an agb star , called ` thermal pulses , ' can cause much more dramatic brightness variations @xcite .",
    "thermal pulses cause readjustments in the global structure of the agb star , carrying elements synthesized in the nuclear burning regions to the surface .",
    "this process , known as the ` third dredge up , ' is responsible for the formation of carbon - rich agb stars @xcite , as well as bringing more exotic elements such as tc to the surface @xcite , and its precise details remain a topic of current research ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "towards the end of their evolution , agb stars exhibit extensive rates of mass - loss @xcite , driven by the aforementioned hydrodynamic pulsations and radiation pressure on the resultant dust grains @xcite .",
    "this mass - loss , enhanced by elements produced in the nuclear - burning regions of the star and dredged to the surface , makes agb stars one of the primary sources for @xmath11-elements in the universe , and an important contributor to dust in galaxies .",
    "the precise degree to which agb stars contribute dust to the interstellar medium ( ism ) is a matter of some dispute however .",
    "specifically , to what extent do agb stars or supernovae ( sne ) dominate this process ?",
    "the agb contribution to a galaxy s total dust budget can be computed if the entire population of mass - losing agb stars in the galaxy is identified , and the rate of dust production by each star in this sample is known",
    ". a comprehensive study of galactic agb stars is hampered by extinction in the plane of the milky way .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) offers the ideal combination of relative proximity and low line - of - sight extinction , allowing for detailed studies of galaxy - wide evolved star populations .",
    "the lmc s high galactic latitude minimizes both foreground contamination by milky way stars and reddening due to intervening dust .",
    "in addition , the distance to the lmc ( @xmath050  kpc ) is well determined ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "see @xcite for discussion and meta - analysis of this measurement .",
    "this is close enough that individual stars can be resolved , yet far enough away that the 3-d structure of the lmc can be neglected , accurate distances assumed for all stars , and therefore intrinsic brightnesses determined .",
    "recent large - scale photometric surveys of the lmc such as the _ magellanic clouds photometric survey _ ( mcps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the _ two micron all - sky survey _",
    "( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the _ surveying the agents of a galaxy s evolution _ survey ( sage ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have allowed the construction of catalogs of the entire agb population of that galaxy , with multi - band photometry for tens of thousands of sources @xcite .",
    "the sage - spec follow - on to the sage survey @xcite has produced spectral classifications for 100 sources in the lmc @xcite .",
    "the irsf survey @xcite also examined the lmc in near - ir ( jh@xmath5 ) bands .",
    "the akari mission @xcite has also been used to survey a portion of the lmc @xcite .",
    "while this survey covers a smaller area , the unique [ 11 ] and [ 15 ]  @xmath12 m  bands of the akari satellite are a valuable contribution to the multi - wavelength coverage of this important galaxy .",
    "the ongoing vista magellanic clouds survey ( vmc ) @xcite will push three magnitudes deeper than the akari survey , and has already been used to develop a spatially resolved star formation history of part of the lmc @xcite .    as a first step towards the direct measurement of mass - loss rates for the entire lmc agb sample , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) computed infrared excesses from sage data and used these to estimate the total dust injection rate .",
    "boyer et al .",
    "( 2012 , in press ) have performed a similar analysis for the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "@xcite determined a simple ir color proxy for mass - loss using mass - loss rates derived by @xcite and @xcite through detailed modeling of individual sources , and extrapolated a global gas and dust budget for the lmc .",
    "an alternative to detailed modeling is to compare the observed seds of sources to pre - computed models . with this aim , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iv ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper v ) presented the grid of rsg and agb models ( grams ) for oxygen - rich and carbonaceous dust respectively . in this paper",
    "we apply the grams to the whole population of evolved stars in the lmc in order to derive more precise measurements of individual sources and the population wide return of mass to the galaxy .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : data ] of this paper discusses the sources of our observational data (   [ sec : dat_source ] ) and our fitting procedure (   [ sec : var ] &  [ sec : fitting ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : tour ] displays some specific fits representative of our sample . section  [ sec : discuss ] describes the major results of our fitting , including the o - rich / c - rich determination (   [ sec : oc ] ) , the revealed luminosity function of the evolved stellar population of the lmc (   [ sec : lum_func ] ) , the integrated dust mass return to the ism (   [ sec : mlr ] &  [ sec : int_mlr ] ) , and the development of simple observational proxies for dust mass - loss rate (   [ sec : proxy ] ) .",
    "we review our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the original sage survey was conducted in two epochs , spaced @xmath03 months apart @xcite .",
    "the observations from these epochs have been combined into a single mosaic photometry archive and catalog , which is deeper and has smaller photometric errors than the individual epochs .",
    "our dataset consists of 33718  sources extracted from the sage mosaic photometry archive .",
    "these sources have been matched to optical data from the magellanic clouds photometric survey ( mcps ) @xcite , near - infrared photometry from the 2mass survey @xcite , and the variability information of the macho survey @xcite , allowing us to construct 12 band spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from the u band to 24  @xmath12 m  for most of our sources .",
    "a 2  matching radius was used for all catalog joins .",
    "details of the matching to the mcps catalog can be found in the sage data delivery document .",
    "the join to the macho catalog is discussed more thoroughly in @xcite .",
    "all non - sage photometry has been de - reddened , with the de - reddened flux , @xmath13 , related to the observed photometry , @xmath14 by @xmath15 .",

    "a star is classified as an oxygen - rich ( o - rich ) or carbon - rich ( c - rich ) agb candidate based on its location on the @xmath5  vs. _ j _  @xmath17 @xmath5  color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "the _ j _  @xmath17 [ 3.6 ] color ( or , in the absence of a j - band detection , the [ 3.6 ] @xmath17 [ 8.0 ] color ) is used to select extreme agb candidates .",
    "see   2.2 in @xcite for explicit definitions of these color cuts .",
    "rsg candidates are selected based on the color - magnitude criteria presented in @xcite .",
    "specifically , rsgs candidates are defined as being brighter than the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) , @xmath18 , and between the lines @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "these cmd - based definitions are illustrated in figure  [ fig : cmd_class ] .",
    "looking for young stellar objects ( ysos ) , @xcite published a list of 13 ` extremely red objects ' that they spectroscopically identified as carbon stars , based on the presence of sic absorption .",
    "twelve of these sources lie outside our defined cmd cuts and are therefore not included in our initial dataset , but we have manually added them to our list , using the photometry published in that work .",
    "all of these sources are classified as extreme agb candidates .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we present the largest sample of evolved stars subjected to radiative transfer modeling to date . by fitting @xmath030000 stars with @xmath012 bands of photometry each to pre - computed radiative transfer models from the grams model grid of o- and c - rich agb stars and rsgs ,",
    "we compute individual bolometric luminosities and dust mass - loss rates for the entire evolved star population of the lmc .",
    "our work forms a useful prediction to be tested against models of stellar population synthesis and stellar evolution .",
    "we establish that the grams model grid is an important new tool for the study of stellar populations .",
    "capable of generating statistically accurate predictions for difficult - to - observe stellar parameters such as mass - loss rate and luminosity for thousands of stars in a reasonable period of time , grams will be valuable for interpreting the infrared observations of future missions (   [ sec : fitting ] ) . through comparison to previously published studies of agb stars in the lmc",
    ", we show that the grams o- and c - rich identifications are over 80% accurate (   [ sec : oc ] ) .",
    "we present a quadratic formula for the @xmath5  band bolometric correction of agb stars as a function of _ j _  @xmath17 @xmath5  color (   [ sec : lum_func ] ) .",
    "our fit is detailed in table  [ tab : bc_fit ] .",
    "we characterize the luminosity functions of both o - rich and c - rich agb stars in the lmc .",
    "the o - rich stars follow a distribution between m@xmath21 = -3.5 - -5 centered at @xmath0 -4.3 ( @xmath03500  l@xmath9 ) .",
    "individual c - rich agb stars tend to be brighter , distributed between m@xmath21 = -4  -6  m@xmath21 , centered at -4.7  m@xmath21 ( @xmath05500  l@xmath9 ) . despite tending to be less luminous on an individual basis , o - rich sources dominate the integrated ir light from the lmc evolved stellar population , by virtue of their greater numbers (   [ sec : lum_func ] ) .",
    "we find that the agb stars exhibiting the ` long secondary period ' phenomenon , and lying on sequence d are significantly more o - rich than the stellar population on the other , radially pulsating sequences .",
    "we see a qualitative relationship between m@xmath7  and pulsation period for radially pulsating agb stars , in that sources with no detectable mass - loss are concentrated on sequences 3 &  4 , and do not appear at all on sequences 1 &  2 (   [ sec : mlr ] ) .",
    "we also derive hyperbolic fits to the m@xmath7  from c - rich agb stars as a function of various near - ir colors (   [ sec : proxy ] ) .",
    "presented in table  [ tab : mlr_fit ] , our fits are derived from a sample much larger than those used by previous studies .",
    "we derive a total dust mass - injection rate for the entire rsg+agb stellar population of ( @xmath22  m@xmath2 yr@xmath3of the lmc through consistent , direct summation . assuming a gas - to - dust ratio @xmath23 for o - rich agb stars and rsgs , and a ratio @xmath24 for c - rich agb stars , this translates to a total mass injection rate into the ism from rsgs and agb stars of @xmath25  m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 , with half the mass coming from carbon - rich agb stars .",
    "dominated by the uncertainty in the gas - to - dust ratio , this figure is accurate to a factor of @xmath02 .",
