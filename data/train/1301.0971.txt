    "the intrinsic degrees of freedom of an electron are its charge and spin , which lead to electronics and spintronics .",
    "the valley degree of freedom on honeycomb lattices is expected to provide us with the notion of valleytronics .",
    "valleytronics was originally proposed in graphenerycerz , xiao07,yao08 , where the states near the fermi energy are @xmath2 orbitals residing near the @xmath3 and @xmath4 points at opposite corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "the low - energy dynamics in the @xmath3 and @xmath5 valleys is described by the dirac theory .",
    "the valley excitations are protected by the suppression of intervalley scattering .",
    "however it is hard to realize valleytronics in graphene since the gap is closed and since it is difficult to discriminate between the @xmath3 and @xmath5 points experimentally . in this",
    "context , transition metal dichalcogenides@xcite become a new playground of valleytronics , where a considerably large gap is open . in the most recent experimental progress ,",
    "the identity of valleys manifests as valley - selective circular dichroism , leading to valley polarization with circularly polarized light , offering a possibility to a realization of valleytronicsyao08,xiao , zeng , cao , li .",
    "recently , another honeycomb system of silicon named silicene has been experimentally synthesized@xcite and theoretically explored@xcite . as prominent properties ,",
    "it consists of buckled sublattices made of @xmath0 sites and @xmath1 sites , and the dirac electron has a mass .",
    "the buckled structure allows us to control the dirac mass independently at the @xmath3 and @xmath4 points by applying external fields such that electric field@xcite , exchange fieldezawaqah and photo - irradiation@xcite .",
    "it is possible to generate a rich variety of topologically protected states in silicene , each of which has a characteristic spin - valley structure .    in this paper",
    "we propose to make a full control of the dirac mass in order to search for new topological states together with new spin - valley structures in silicene .",
    "the dirac mass can be fully controlled by four potential terms corresponding to the spin and valley degrees of freedom , among which three terms have already been studiedezawanjp , ezawaqah , ezawaphoto .",
    "the last one is driven by applying the staggered exchange field @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are exchange fields operating on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 sites , respectively .",
    "these four terms move dirac cones , respecting the electron - hole symmetry .",
    "it is also possible to introduce four other potential terms , which shift dirac cones so as to break the electron - hole symmetry .",
    "the typical one is driven by applying the mean staggered exchange field @xmath9 .",
    "well - known topologically protected states are quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulator @xcite and quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) insulatoronoda , qiao , tse , ding , qiaog , liu .",
    "they are characterized by the helical and chiral gapless edge modes , respectively , according to the bulk - edge correspondence@xcite .",
    "the qah effect is the quantum hall effect without landau levels , while the qsh effect is the quantum hall effect of spins rather than charges .    by introducing the staggered exchange field @xmath10",
    ", we obtain rich phase diagrams as illustrated in fig.1 and fig.3 .",
    "first of all , we are able to generate the spin - polarized qah ( sqah ) insulator together with single dirac - cone ( sdc ) semimetals along its phase boundaries [ fig.2 ] .",
    "the sdc semimetal is a remarkable state that has one massless dirac cone and three massive dirac cones , evading the nielsen - ninomiya fermion - doubling problem@xcite .",
    "second , a new finding is the quantum - spin - quantum - anomolous hall ( qsqah ) insulator .",
    "it is a new type of topological insulator such that , e.g. , the qah effect is realized at the @xmath3 point while the qsh effect is realized at the @xmath4 point [ fig.4 ] .",
    "third , another new finding is a single - valley ( sv ) semimetal such that , e.g. , the gap is open ( closed ) at the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) point with spin degeneracy .",
    "it is different from the sdc state which has only one closed gap without spin degeneracy .",
    "these spin - valley dependent band structures will be experimentally observed by spin - valley selective circular dichroismyao08,xiao , zeng , cao , li , ezawaopt .",
    "we point out that a ( semi)metallic state appearing at the phase boundary between two topologically distinctive insulators is also protected topologically",

    "what follows we use notations @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 in indices while @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 in equations for the spin , the sublattice pseudospin and the valley , respectively .",

    "we find that qah effects can be induced by the haldane term or the staggered exchange term since they break the trs .",

    "second , @xmath59 is the mean exchange coupling term@xcite with @xmath60 .",
    "the rest two terms @xmath61 and @xmath62 have not been discussed previously , and their experimental realizations would yet be explored .",

    "we can see that the gap is open everywhere in the phase diagram except for the phase boundaries : some typical examples of nanoribbon band structure are found in fig.[figbandmdm ] .",

    "second , at the boundary , the topological metal ( tm ) and the single - valley topological metal ( svtm ) emerge .",
    "the band touches parabolically in them .",
    "their emergencies are also protected topologically since they are sandwiched by different topological insulators .",
    "an interesting experiment to probe and manipulate the valley degree of freedom is optical absorption@xcite . we briefly discuss that spin - valley dependent band structures we have found will be experimentally observable by spin - valley - selective circular dichroism .",
    "circular dichroism is a phenomena in which the response of the left- and right - handed circularly polarized light is different . to assess the optical selectivity of spin and valley by circularly polarized light , we compute the spin - valley dependent degree of circular polarization between the top valence bands and bottom of conduction bands .",
    "it is straightforward to apply the standard method@xcite to calculate an optical absorption .",
