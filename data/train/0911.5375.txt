    "wide band - gap ii - vi semiconductors zno , mgo , and beo have been extensively investigated because of their great potential applications in the spintronic and optoelectronic devices@xcite .",
    "recently znbeo alloy has been proposed as another wide - band gap oxide , and its band gap can be efficiently engineered to vary from the zno band gap ( 3.4 ev ) to that of beo ( 10.6 ev)@xcite .",
    "furthermore , zno based uv light emitting diodes ( leds ) with an active layer region composed of zno / znbeo quantum wells also have been fabricated@xcite .",
    "practically alloying is a good approach to perform band - gap engineering to extend the available band gap , and the band gap _",
    "_ e__@xmath1 of the alloy _",
    "a@xmath2b@xmath3c _ can be described as @xmath4 where _ b _ is called the band - gap ( optical ) bowing parameter , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the band gap of the binary constituents _ ac _ and _ bc _ , respectively . for most semiconductor alloys , the bowing parameter _",
    "b _ is almost independent of composition _ _ x__@xcite . however , the bowing parameters _ b _ of ga@xmath3n@xmath2as and zn@xmath3te@xmath2o alloys are strongly composition dependent , indicating that theses alloys contain some elements with large differences between the size and atomic orbital energies .",
    "these alloys have attracted a great deal of attention@xcite .",
    "it is of great interest therefore to investigate how the bowing parameters _ b _ and the band gaps of znbeo , mgbeo , and znmgo to vary since the large differences between zn ( mg ) and be atoms also exist in these alloys .",
    "it is well known that the _ p_-type doping bottleneck poses a challenge for the full utilization of the wide band - gap oxides mentioned above . due to the low valence band maximum ( vbm ) ,",
    "the transition energies of acceptor defects are always deep and the acceptors are hard to ionize at normal operating temperature .",
    "great efforts have been made to overcome the _ p_-type difficulty , for example , through the codoping approach , complex defect , and impurity band@xcite .",
    "et al . _ also proposed that replacing zn with isovalent mg or be surrounding with n acceptor defects may act to lower the acceptor transition energy through reducing the kinetic _",
    "p - d _ repulsion@xcite . in the znbeo alloy , it is easy to form n@xmath0+nbe@xmath7 complexes ; thus the transition energy is expected to be shallower when the n@xmath0 defect is surrounded by more be neighboring atoms . therefore it is also interesting to systematically study the transition energy of the n@xmath0 defect in the znbeo alloy .    in this work",
    "we systematically investigate znbeo , znmgo , and mgbeo alloys , in order to understand their band structure properties .",
    "we hope to show that the bowing parameters are large and dependent on composition for mg@xmath3be@xmath2o and zn@xmath3be@xmath2o alloys , and much larger even in the be - rich region . however , the bowing parameter _",
    "b _ is small for the zn@xmath3mg@xmath2o alloy .",
    "we also suggest that introducing a small amount of be into mgo will reduce the band gap .",
    "we note that these phenomena can be explained by the size and atomic orbital energies differences between the constituents and isovalent defect levels in these systems .",
    "furthermore , we also show that n is a good _ p_-type dopant in the zn@xmath8be@xmath9o alloy which may be a good _ p_-type doping material .",
    "however , the transition energies of n@xmath0 in the zn@xmath10mg@xmath9be@xmath11o quaternary alloy lattice - matched to gan are deep due to the lower vbm according to our band offsets calculations .",
    "our first - principles band - structure and total energies calculations are performed using the density functional theory ( dft ) within the local - density approximation@xcite ( lda ) as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) code@xcite .",
    "the electron and core interactions are included using the frozen - core projected augmented wave approach@xcite . the zn 3__d _ _ electrons are explicitly treated as valence electrons .",
    "the whole electron wave function is expanded in plane waves up to a cutoff energy of 400 ev .",
    "all the geometries are optimised by minimising the quantum mechanical forces acting on the atoms . for the brillouin zone integration",
    ", we use the _ k _ points that are equivalent to the 4@xmath124@xmath124 monkhorst - pack special _",
    "k_-point meshes@xcite in the zinc - blende ( zb ) brillouin zone .",
    "in order to calculate the band structure parameters of _ a@xmath2b@xmath3c _ alloys , we adopted the more efficient special quasirandom structure ( sqs ) approach@xcite . in this approach ,",
    "we use a smaller unit cell to model the random alloys , where mixed - atom sites are occupied based on the physically most relevant structure correction functions which are closest to the exact values of an random alloy . in our calculation",

    "in order to investigate the electronic and structure properties of the random alloys , it is essential to calculate the lattice constants and band gap parameters of related zno , mgo , and beo binary alloys .",
    "_ concluded that the band structures of the zb and wz phases for zno ( gan ) are very similar near the band edge at @xmath13 point through systematically investigating the relationships between the band gaps of zb and wz phase of semiconductors@xcite .",

    "band offset is an important parameter in the heterostructures . we shall describe how we investigated the natural band alignment by adopting the approach proposed by wei@xcite",
    "this method is also widely used in photoemission core level spectroscopy@xcite . according to wei s method@xcite",
    ", the band offset is given by @xmath17 here , @xmath18 ( and similarly for @xmath19 ) are the energy separations between core level ( c ) and valence band maximum energy for pure ax ( and similarly for pure by ) , while @xmath20 is the difference in core level binding energy between ax and by at the ax / by superlattice .",
    "we calculate the @xmath21 and @xmath19 at the equilibrium zinc - blende lattice constants for ax and by , respectively .",
    "we use the average lattice constant @xmath22 ( between ax and by ) to calculate the @xmath23 in the ax / by superlattice .",
    "a more detailed description of the procedure can be found in ref .",
    "32 .    the natural conduction band minimum ( cbm ) alignment is calculated by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the experimental band gap difference between the ax and by alloys .",
    "mg@xmath26be@xmath27o@xmath28 , zn@xmath29be@xmath26o@xmath28 and zno alloys.,width=245 ]    our calculated natural band alignment is shown in fig .",
    "3 . for the vbm alignment",
    ", the vbm of zno is higher than that of mgo and beo .",
    "this is because the _ p - d _ ( @xmath30 ) repulsion pushes up the vbm , whereas mg and be have no active _ d _ electrons . according to the common - anion rule@xcite , the valence band offset is small between common - anion systems .",
    "however , the vbm of beo is higher than that of mgo .",
    "this is because beo shows strong covalency , resulting in the kinetic - energy - induced valence band broadening@xcite .",
    "if we assume that the vbm varies linearly as a function of the alloy composition , zn@xmath29be@xmath26o@xmath28 would have a vbm approximately 0.32 ev lower than that of zno .",
    "however , our direct calculation shows that vbm of zn@xmath29be@xmath26o@xmath28 ( zn@xmath8be@xmath9o ) alloy is only about 0.11 ev lower than that of zno due to the large _ p - d _ repulsion . in order to investigate the natural conduction band alignment",
    ", we use the experimental band gaps demonstrated in fig .",
    "we see that the zn@xmath8be@xmath9o alloy acts as a good barrier material for zno - based uv leds .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 have values of approximately 0.60 and 0.11 ev , respectively , which are large enough to strongly confine the electrons and holes well@xcite .",
    "the quaternary alloy zn@xmath33mg@xmath26be@xmath27o@xmath28 has a cbm as low as that of zno , indicating that it can be _",
    "n_-type doped easily .",
    "by contrast _",
    "p_-type doping is more difficult due to the low vbm which is also confirmed by our study of _ p_-type doping above .",
    "based on these chemical behaviours , we can tailor the band offset to practically perform the band - engineering as desired .",
    "we hope that our results will be helpful for the applications of optoelectronic devices .",
    "we have investigated the band gap bowing parameters and _ p_-type doping properties of ( zn , mg , be)o related random ternary and quaternary alloys using first - principles band - structure methods .",
    "the bowing parameters are large and dependent on composition for znbeo and mgbeo alloys due to their large size and chemical mismatch .",
    "we also show that the band gap of mgo will reduce on adding a small amount of be into mgo .",
    "the acceptor transition energy level becomes shallower when n has more be nearest neighbors , thus znbeo ( zn@xmath8be@xmath9o ) may be a good _ p_-type material .",
    "the electronic and _ p_-type doping properties of znmgbeo quaternary alloy lattice - matched to gan substrate are also studied . according to our natural band alignment calculations , _ n_-type doping of zn@xmath33mg@xmath26be@xmath27o@xmath28 should be easy due to the low cbm .",
