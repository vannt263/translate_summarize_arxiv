    "this effect obviously disappears with increasing of @xmath7 .",
    "it seems to be a common problem for any non gauge invariant lattice scheme . in particular",
    "our calculations show that the same phenomenon occurs in roma approach @xcite . in the particular model",
    "one can get better agreement by using other approaches e.g. overlap formalism @xcite or staggered fermions as was done in somewhat different context in ref.@xcite . in our case",
    "we could easily avoid the problem by using a gauge invariant wilson term . in this case",
    "our regularized action is manifestly gauge invariant and the determinant is periodic with the period 1 .",
    "hence if there is an agreement with the continuum in the interval @xmath57 it is continued automatically to any @xmath13 .",
    "however for general chiral models considering large nonsmooth external fields really makes a problem .",

    "therefore in the model under consideration both pv regularization and roma approach give analogous results .",
    "the advantages of pv approach are twofold .",
    "first of all in this case the only source of gauge symmetry breaking of the action is the wilson term and no gauge noninvariant counterterms are needed .",
    "one can avoid gauge symmetry breaking completely by choosing other methods of spectrum degeneracy removing .",
    "slac - model supplemented by pv regularization is the example of manifestly gauge invariant ( although nonlocal ) model without spectrum doubling @xcite .",
    "moreover , gauge symmetry preserving pv type regularization may be constructed also for anomaly free chiral models @xcite .",
    "secondly , in more complicated four dimensional models in the framework of roma approach one would need to introduce more gauge noninvariant counterterms , whereas pv type regularization cuts all unwanted effects of momenta @xmath70 , provided the yang ",
    "mills fields are also regularized by means of higher covariant derivatives ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that even in a two - dimensional models a simple mass renormalization may be not sufficient to get a good agreement with the continuum @xcite .",
    "the numerical results obtained above are in a good agreement with the analitical estimaties .",
    "one can show that all the lattice diagrams with more than two external lines differ from the corresponding diagrams in the continuum toron model by the terms of order @xmath71 . at the same time @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the mass gap in the comtinuum toron model . therefore to get the correct continuum result without pv regularization one has to add to determinant @xmath28 the counterterm with the coefficient @xmath74 , to be compared with the numerical value @xmath75 .",
    "if the pv fields are introduced the following expressions for polarization operator can be derived : @xmath76 @xmath77    these values are in a good agreement with the numerical results presented at fig.2 .",
    "analogous estimates are done for anomaly free chiral models .",
    "in this section we apply the approach described above to anomaly free chiral models on the finite lattice . the possibility to supress the contribution of momenta close to the border of brillouin zone in anomaly free 4d models by introducing a chiral gauge invariant pv type regularization",
    "is related to the fact that in this case divergent diagrams ( with less than 5 external vector lines ) contribute only to the modulus of the determinant . from the point of view of these diagrams",
    "the theory is essentially vector like . in two dimension the anomalous diagram is the polarization operator , and the only way to get rid off anomaly is to use a combination of left - handed and right - handed interactions in which the terms proportional to @xmath78 cancel .",
    "in particular one can consider 11112 model including four left - handed fermions with charge 1 and one right - handed fermion with charge 2 .",

    "the regularized action @xmath91 in the formal continuum limit , when the wilson terms are neglected , is invariant under chiral gauge transformations of the fields @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",

    "the polarization operator is a sum of the terms which have a form @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a lattice vertex function and the propagators @xmath102 are given by eqs.([9 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "consider firstly the contribution of physical fields .",
    "as the model is anomaly free , the terms proportional to @xmath103 cansel and one gets @xmath104    following the reasonings of ref.@xcite one can show that analogous expression for pv fields cancel the contribution of momenta close to the border of the brillouin zone and the remaining part in the limit @xmath105 coincides with the gauge invariant continuum result . separating the summation domain into two parts @xmath106 : @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 : @xmath110 , and choosing @xmath111 , @xmath112",
    ", one sees that in the domain @xmath109 one can expand the pv fields propagators in terms of @xmath55 .",
    "the zero order term coincides with the propagator of @xmath9-fields and due to our choice of charges the leading terms in the expansion of @xmath113 cancel the value @xmath114 .",
    "the next term is majorated by @xmath115 and vanishes in the limit @xmath116 .    in the domain",
    "@xmath106 one can expand the wilson term in power of @xmath56 .",
    "the leading term in the limit @xmath116 gives the gauge invariant continuum expression and the higher order terms are majorated by @xmath117 when @xmath116 .    by the same reasoning all higher order diagrams , which correspond to power counting convergent integrals in the limit @xmath116 coincide with the corresponding continuum expressions .",
    "so we expect that simulations of the 11112 model ( [ 7 ] ) regularized by the pv action ( [ 8 ] ) has to provide a reasonable approximation to the continuum toron model .",
    "a straightforward calculation gives for the regularized lattice 11112 determinant normalized on 1 at @xmath13=0 the following expression : @xmath118 d_{pv}[h],\\ ] ] @xmath119 d_{+w}^*[2h],\\ ] ] @xmath120 = \\prod_{p =- n/2 + 1}^{n/2 } \\frac{g[p , h]}{h[p , 0]},\\ ] ] @xmath121 = \\prod_{p =- n/2 + 1}^{n/2 } \\left ( \\frac{\\bigl| g[p , 2h ] \\bigr|^2 + m^2\\bigl [ b^2(p , 2h ) + b^2(p , 0 ) - 2w^2(p ) + m^2 \\bigr ] } { h[p , m ] h[p , -m ] } \\right)^{-1}.\\ ] ] here @xmath122 = [ b_0(p , h ) + { \\rm i}b_1(p , h ) ] [ b_0(p , 0 ) - { \\rm i}b_1(p , 0 ) ] + w^2(p),\\ ] ] @xmath123 = b^2(p , 0 ) + \\bigl ( w(p ) + { \\cal m } \\bigr)^2,\\ ] ] @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath99 are defined above .",
