    "materials composed of hard cohesionless grains , such as dry sand , exhibit many remarkable properties ranging from cluster formation in gaseous phases,@xcite to unexpected flows and jets in fluid - like phases,@xcite and to complex organization of inhomogeneous stresses in dense fluid or solid phases.@xcite in this paper we focus on one feature of the solid phase that has received much attention : the distribution @xmath0 of contact forces between grains in a system that is supporting a macroscopic compression or shear force . in a number of experiments and numerical simulations involving non - cohesive grains",
    ", @xmath0 appears to decay approximately exponentially at large @xmath1,@xcite which runs counter to the nave expectation of a gaussian distribution about some average @xmath1 .",
    "several theoretical analyses of model systems have indicated possible explanations for an exponential tail,@xcite including an analytic calculation for a special case of isostatic packings of frictionless disks .",
    "@xcite still , a fundamental understanding of the phenomenon has not been achieved .    to motivate the problem considered in the present work , we recall that for generic packings of frictional and/or nonspherical hard particles",
    "geometrical constraints permit the formation of more contacts than would be required for supporting imposed stresses .",
    "that is , the contact network can contain enough contacts that the stress balance conditions do not determine a unique configuration of the intergrain forces .",
    "( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in such cases , the determination of @xmath0 must involve some sort of average over the ensemble of possible force configurations .",
    "edwards has suggested that the appropriate measure in configuration space for this ensemble is a flat one ; i.e. , that all possible force configurations should be considered equally weighted.@xcite in general , such an ensemble should include averages over different contact network geometries as well as different stress states on a given network.@xcite    in this paper we investigate the question of whether edwards hypothesis leads to exponential tails in @xmath0 for a system of non - cohesive grains in which the contact network forms a triangular lattice .",
    "we first study the case of hydrostatic compression , where our results confirm those of snoeijer et al,@xcite though we employ different boundary conditions and different numerical methods .",
    "we then examine the effects of diluting the lattice to the rigidity percolation threshold .",
    "the transition appears to be first order , with a finite jump in the number of available configurations at threshold .",
    "@xmath0 becomes substantially broader than in the full lattice case , but still decays faster than exponentially on the lattice sizes within our numerical reach .",
    "finally , we consider the effects of anisotropic imposed stresses .",
    "we show that strong anisotropy must produce an exponential tail in large systems and present numerical results showing the approach to this limit for varying degrees of anisotropy .",
    "because the difference between the decay produced by our model and a true exponential decay is rather subtle , it is difficult to give firm interpretations of most of the experimental and numerical results .",
    "observation of two or three decades of exponential decay could still be consistent with the slowly developing deviation we observe in isotropic systems .",
    "on the other hand , a given experiment may involve sufficiently strong anisotropies that we would expect something even closer to a true exponential .",
    "the recent results of majmudar and behringer @xcite clearly illustrate that anisotropy due to shearing produces distributions much closer to exponential than those observed under isotropic compression , but we urge caution in making direct comparisons between the model results and experiments on disordered , deformable grains .    in the model described below , all forces are directed along the line of contact between two grains and tensile forces are not allowed .",
    "this may be thought of as corresponding to the case of frictionless , non - cohesive , circular disks , though a generic set of perfectly circular disks could not form as many contacts as are present in the model .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed , so there is no distinction between bulk and boundary contacts . by treating the force network without regard to any distortions of the lattice ,",
    "we are considering systems of grains with elastic moduli large enough that the boundary forces cause negligible strain ; i.e. , we consider either very hard grains or very weak boundary forces . in all cases , we fix the contact network and study the ensemble of force configurations on that network .",
    "we note that fluctuations are large .",
    "@xmath0 in any given force configuration may look quite different from the @xmath0 obtained by averaging over configurations , even on the largest lattices we have studied .    for the smallest nontrivial lattice , consisting of nine grains , we calculate @xmath0 both analytically and numerically , and find good agreement . for larger lattices ,",
    "we employ numerical sampling methods involving monte carlo moves that maintain the force balance constraints at all times ( in contrast to simulated annealing methods @xcite ) .",
    "we study the distribution of bond strengths on an @xmath2 triangular lattice corresponding to the contacts in a hexagonal packing of monodisperse circular grains .",
    "we consider a system in the shape of a rhombus , having @xmath3 bonds or edges in each lattice direction , and subject to periodic boundary conditions , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] .",
    "each edge carries a scalar variable @xmath1 specifying the magnitude of the force transmitted across a contact . in order to fix the three components of the macroscopic stress tensor @xmath4 we specify the total compressive forces @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 supported along each of the three lattice directions .     triangular lattice ( with @xmath8 ) . under periodic boundary conditions light edges on the left",

    ", the vector force balance condition imposes @xmath10 constraints .",
    "these constraints are not all independent , however .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions guarantee that the sum of all the single - grain constraint equations is trivially zero , leaving @xmath11 independent constraints .",
    "fixing @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 imposes 3 additional constraints , for a total of @xmath12 constraints .",
    "this leaves @xmath13 degrees of freedom in the force configuration .",
    "in addition to force balance equations , there are inequality constraints associated with the fact that the material is non - cohesive .",
    "no force @xmath1 is allowed to be negative .",
    "it is this condition that introduces nonlinearity in the system .",
    "for any two force balanced , tension free configurations on the lattice , any weighted average with positive weights will also be force balanced and tension free .",
    "sums with a negative weighting of a configuration , however , will not always be allowed , as they may contain negative forces on some edges .",
    "we represent the system configuration by a vector of forces @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",

    "the next ensures force balance at each vertex , and the last enforces the boundary conditions .",

    "[ fig : slab ] shows a shaded slab of the system .",
    "the total force on this slab must be zero , which implies that the vector sum of the forces on the edges indicated by thick lines on one side of the slab must be equal to the vector sum of the forces on the other side .",
    "since the vector sum has a unique decomposition into contributions from the @xmath33 edges and the @xmath36 edges , the sum of the @xmath35 s in each direction must independently be the same on both sides of the slab .",
    "this argument is independent of the thickness of the slab , so in the @xmath33 direction each of the @xmath34 layers must have @xmath35 s that sum to @xmath6 , and similarly for @xmath37 and @xmath36 .     must have a sum of forces equal to @xmath38 . ]    for the @xmath39 case , the integral can be evaluated analytically . here",

    "there is one obvious null direction ; i.e. , a linear combination of wheel moves that results in no change to any edge of the lattice .",
    "we prove in appendix b that the number of linearly independent wheel moves is exactly @xmath13 , which is the number required to span the space of force configurations .    fig .",
    "[ fig : stuck ] illustrates a geometric subtlety that must be taken into account when attempting to explore the allowed stress states using wheel moves ( or any other basis set of moves ) .",

    "the primary difference between the prefect triangular lattice and disordered ones ( or even other crystalline ones ) is that lattices with no sets of collinear bars that span the system can not support arbitrarily strong anisotropic stresses ; i.e. , in most cases there would be a maximal value of @xmath124 .",
