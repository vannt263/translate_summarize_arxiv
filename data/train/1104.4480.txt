    "m87 ( virgo a , ngc4486 , 3c274 ) is a giant elliptical galaxy near the center of the virgo cluster .",
    "the well - known , kpc - scale jet in this galaxy is a prominent source of radio , optical , near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) and x - ray emission .",
    "there are remarkable similarities between the radio , optical and nuv emission on scales @xmath0 kpc .",
    "the bright knots , the filamentary emission between the knots , and the bends and twists in the jet can easily be identified in the optical and nuv as well as the radio . while x - ray images from chandra are not of comparable resolution to the",
    "radio or optical , the same bright knots and overall jet structure can easily be seen in the x - rays .",
    "relativistic proper motions are seen within the knots , both in the radio and the optical .",
    "a variety of models have been proposed for the physical state of the kpc - scale jet , but none has emerged as definitive .",
    "@xcite proposed a hydrodynamic model , in which the knots are shocks caused by the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability .",
    "@xcite extended the hydrodynamic model , arguing that intensity changes and spectral evolution along the jet can be explained by shock compression of a weakly magnetized plasma .",
    "other authors have put forth models in which the magnetic field plays a key role .",
    "@xcite and also @xcite proposed that the jet is a force - free mhd configuration ( following @xcite ) . in this scenario the knots",
    "correspond to `` magnetic islands '' in the force - free state .",
    "more recently , @xcite , also @xcite , presented an mhd model of the jet s launching from the central black hole ; they identified hst-1 as a recollimation shock .",
    "in this paper we return to hydrodynamic models and consider the pair of twisted emission filaments reported by lobanov , hardee & eilek ( 2003 ; hereafter lhe ) .",
    "we propose that these filaments are created by the kh instability in a weakly magnetized , predominantly hydrodynamic flow .",
    "several authors have used the properties of kh modes to estimate the physical conditions in jets and their surroundings ( e.g. , perucho et al .",
    "the method has been applied to knots in the the m87 jet @xcite ; to twisted structures in the 3c120 jet @xcite ; to twisted emission threads in the 3c273 jet @xcite , to superluminal motions and accelerations of components along curved trajectories in the 3c345 jet @xcite , and to transverse jet structure in 0836 + 710 @xcite .",
    "we base our study of the m87 jet on a linear analysis of the kh instability , e.g. , @xcite , supplemented by our experience with numerical simulations of its development and saturation .",
    "we chose this approach because our goal is to constrain the physical conditions in the m87 jet and its surroundings , and it would be prohibitively expensive to run the large suite of simulations that would be necessary for a good exploration of parameter space .",
    "for example , computational constraints make it difficult to simulate an expanding , three - dimensional , relativistic jet , close to the line of sight , over the distance from hst-1 to knot a , with sufficient spatial resolution and temporal storage .",
    "such a simulation would need to have enough computational zones to satisfy projection and numerical viscosity issues @xcite .",
    "the simulation would also have to span and store enough time information to deal with the light - travel time effects that lead to the observed superluminal motions @xcite and that make the apparent structure different from the intrinsic structure .",
    "however , more recently @xcite have developed a lagrangian algorithm that accomplishes this task in a better and more physically correct way .",
    "we proceed and organize the paper as follows . in section [ flow_obs ]",
    "we review the structure of the observed jet , particularly the filaments identified by lhe , and the proper motions of the bright knots .",
    "we use the proper motions to estimate the flow speed of the jet plasma and the wave speed of the kh pattern .",
    "the data suggest that the jet decelerates between hst-1 and knot a ; this is a key point of our models . in section [ flow_models ]",
    "we develop an energy - conserving jet model which matches the observed flow deceleration and determines the thermal state of the jet plasma .",
    "we also develop models in which a small part of the energy flux is lost to the cocoon . in both models",
    "we assume the jet is in pressure balance with an external `` cocoon '' , as required by our kh analysis .",
    "in section [ kh_modes ] we present a kh instability analysis , and determine what the thermal state of the cocoon must be if the elliptical mode of the kh instability causes the observed filaments .",
    "we do this by matching solutions of the wave dispersion relation to observations of the pattern speed and wavelength along the jet .",
    "we also verify that the kh instability growth rate under these conditions is sufficiently rapid for the instability to saturate . in section [ scaling ]",
    "we explore the likely internal state of the jet and cocoon plasmas . in section [ pseudo_synch ]",
    "we present a pseudo - synchrotron image of the jet , to compare our most likely model to the observed intensity structure of the real jet .",
    "finally , in section [ summary ] we briefly summarize our results and in section [ discussion ] we discuss a few implications of our models .",
    "in this section we review the basic structure and immediate environment of the m87 jet .",
    "we also review low - order wave modes created by the kh instability and compare them to the structure of the real jet . because our kh analysis requires a model of the jet flow speed as well as the speed of the wave pattern within the jet , we use observed proper motions to determine the evolution of both speeds along the jet .",
    "the overall structure of the m87 jet as seen in the radio is shown in figure [ jet_large ] ( from owen , hardee & cornwell ( 1989 ) ; hereafter ohc ) .",
    "the brightest emission knots in the outer part of the jet are labelled a , b and c. the inner jet  from the core to knot a  is expanding uniformly , limb brightened with sharp edges .",
    "bright knots and fainter filaments can be seen within the flow .",
    "past knot a the jet brightens , stops expanding , and maintains a more uniform radius .",
    "knots b and c contain tightly twisted filaments as well as some bright emission patches .",
    "past knot a the flow develops significant sideways motion , and past knot c it breaks up dramatically .",
    "we take the distance to m87 to be @xmath1  mpc @xcite , thus @xmath2 pc . as we discuss below",
    ", the jet probably lies between @xmath3 and @xmath4 from the line of sight , so its intrinsic length is @xmath5 times longer than its apparent ( projected ) length .",
    "the plasma content of the jet remains unknown .",
    "because the jet is a synchrotron source , we know it must contain a relativistic , magnetized lepton plasma .",
    "@xcite argued for a pure lepton jet , because a cold , electron - ion jet would violate constraints on the opacity and surface brightness of the self - absorbed , pc - scale core .",
    "however , more recent evidence on the jet viewing angle ( as in section [ jet_speed ] ) and the internal energy of the jet @xcite and our results in section [ jet_structure_models ] expand the possible parameter space to allow electron - ion jets within the arguments of @xcite .    the local environment of the jet , on projected scales @xmath6 kpc , is well studied in radio and x - rays . from the radio , we know that the jet feeds , and appears to be surrounded by , inner radio lobes which extend @xmath7 kpc from the galactic core . the western part of the inner lobes can be seen in figure [ jet_large ] .",
    "the inner radio lobes contain a relativistic , magnetized lepton plasma .",
    "the minimum pressure allowed by the synchrotron power of the inner lobes is below that of the local interstellar medium ( ism ) throughout most of the lobes , but a few bright filaments are at higher pressure @xcite .",
    "such bright filaments are probably transient , suggesting jet - driven turbulence in the radio lobes .    from the x - rays ,",
    "we know that the jet sits within the central ism of m87 . that ism is an x - ray loud , ion - electron plasma ; averaged over the inner few kpc it has @xmath8k and @xmath9  @xmath10 , e.g. , @xcite , also @xcite .",
    "the inner ism is magnetized ; @xcite detected faraday rotation from the ism in front of the jet and inner radio lobes .",
    "the inner ism is disordered and turbulent ; filaments , loops and bubbles are apparent in the inner few kpc of the chandra image @xcite .",
    "the correlation of features in the x - ray image with those in the radio halo shows that the radio - loud plasma from the jet is interacting , and probably mixing , with the thermal ism .",
    "@xcite found that emission - line clouds in the inner few kpc of m87 show disordered motion at about half the sound speed of the local ism ; these clouds probably share the velocity field of the ism .      figure [ jet_inner ] shows the inner jet in m87 .",
    "the prominent emission knots are labelled , from the core outwards , as hst-1 ( formerly called knot g ) , d , e , f , i and a. hst-1 is @xmath11 ( projected distance @xmath12 pc ) from the core ; knot a is @xmath13    ( projected distance @xmath14 kpc ) from the core . the jet expands with a constant apparent opening angle , @xmath15 , from well inside hst-1 to knot a. between hst-1 and knot a the emission profile is edge - brightened , relatively sharp in the radio , and contains the twisted filaments reported by lhe .",
    "the projected magnetic field vectors lie more or less along the edge of the jet flow ( ohc ) , which may be indicative of a shear layer @xcite . however , there is no indication of mass entrainment into a turbulent surface layer as suggested for 3c31 on large scales @xcite .",
    "the jet structure seen in the optical and nuv is quite similar to that seen in radio , but there are important differences in detail .",
    "the optical / nuv emission is more concentrated in the knots and towards the jet axis , and the outer edges of the jet are less well defined than in the radio e.g. , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the optical / nuv knots also differ somewhat in polarization from the radio knots @xcite .",
    "the major bright radio or optical knots can also be identified in the lower - resolution x - ray image , e.g. , @xcite , but they can differ in position or structure from their radio or optical counterparts .    in this paper we do not focus on the knots , but rather focus on the twisted filaments which lhe detected in the inner jet of m87 .",
    "lhe extracted slices transverse to the overall jet axis , spaced by the pixel size , in radio ( vla ) and optical ( hst ) images .",
    "they fit each slice with double gaussian profiles , allowing the amplitude , position and width of the two gaussians to vary at each slice .",
    "both vla and hst images revealed a consistent pattern : the jet contains two intertwined emission filaments , which can be traced from hst-1 out to knot a. unlike the situation with the knots , lhe found no significant differences between the filaments in the vla and hst image .",
    "lhe interpreted these results as evidence for a twisted - helix structure , wrapped around the edge of the jet and emitting in radio and optical bands , between hst-1 and knot a. the observed radial difference in filament and knot location within the jet suggests that we can model the filaments without considering the mechanism responsible for the knots .    looking ahead to our kh analysis",
    ", the most important result from lhe is that the observed filament wavelength ( projected on the sky ) is not constant ; it increases from @xmath16 at hst-1 to @xmath17 at knot a. we also point out that the bright knots in the inner jet do not , in general , coincide with filament crossings .",
    "although knot e appears to coincide with a filament crossing , figure [ jet_inner ] shows that knots d , f , i and a are more complex ; this is true in the optical as well as the radio images .      in what follows",
    ", we determine the implications for the jet and its immediate environment if the filaments are generated by kh instability .",
    "the kh instability can occur when velocity shear exists across a fluid boundary , such as the jet surface .",
    "it manifests itself in the form of pressure waves generated at or near the jet surface .",
    "the pressure waves can resemble the twisted filaments in the m87 jet .",
    "small perturbations to the jet flow can be described mathematically in terms of a sum of fourier components , referred to as `` normal modes '' ( as in section [ kh_modes ] and appendix a ) .",
    "the two lowest - order twisting modes , helical and elliptical , describe associated distortions to the jet surface . although higher - order modes initially grow more rapidly , the lower - order modes dominate at nonlinear levels , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "each mode involves both surface waves and body waves , which have different radial structures and move at different speeds",
    ". we will show ( in section [ growth_rates ] ) that surface waves dominate in the m87 situation .",
    "in this paper we argue that the elliptical mode is dominant in the inner jet , and gives rise to the filaments described by lhe .",
    "we illustrate the pressure structure of the surface and first body elliptical modes in figure [ illustrate_kh ] , which shows a typical cross section and an integrated line of sight pressure image for each mode @xcite .",
    "the elliptical surface mode generates two high - pressure filaments near the jet surface .",
    "the first body mode generates two high - pressure filaments located at about the radius midpoint , as well as a spiral , high - pressure pattern between these filaments and the jet surface .    because pressure can be used as a simple proxy for synchrotron emissivity ( see section [ pseudo_synch ] ) , figure [ illustrate_kh ]",
    "illustrates how the the surface and body elliptical modes might appear in a radio jet lying in the plane of the sky .",
    "comparison of figures [ jet_inner ] and [ illustrate_kh ] , along with the double gaussian fits from lhe , indicate that the filaments in the m87 jet lie near to the jet surface and resemble the elliptical surface mode .",
    "we thus suggest that the elliptical surface mode dominates in the inner m87 jet .",
    "relativistic hydrodynamic simulations @xcite suggest that the elliptical surface mode saturates without disrupting the jet , perhaps because this mode does not displace the jet s centerline .",
    "we note that the elliptical body mode grows more slowly than the surface mode in a linear analysis ( see section [ growth_rates ] ) , and simulations show the body modes saturate at lower amplitudes than do the surface modes @xcite .",
    "our hypothesis that elliptical modes dominate in the inner m87 jet disagrees with @xcite who suggested the bright knots in the m87 jet are caused by the helical mode .",
    "in particular , the inner m87 jet between hst-1 and knot a ( as in figure [ jet_inner ] ) does not resemble the morphology of the helical mode , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the helical mode displaces the jet centroid , causing a lateral oscillation in the jet ; but the inner m87 jet has very straight edges , with no sign of lateral displacement . in the absence of significant lateral oscillation , the helical surface mode could still appear as a single , high - pressure filament wrapped around the jet ; this disagrees with the dual , double - helix filaments that exist in the real inner jet . by comparison , the elliptical mode does not displace the jet centroid , but it does create a pair of high - pressure twisted filaments which wrap around the jet .",
    "furthermore , no helical twisting has been detected at sub - parsec scales @xcite ; this suggests there is only a minimal helical perturbation to the jet inside hst-1 .",
    "the apparent absence of a kh helical mode is perhaps surprising .",
    "linear analysis ( as in section [ growth_rates ] ) finds the helical mode will grow more slowly than higher - order modes in the m87 jet , but still rapidly enough that one might expect it to be detectable .",
    "simulations agree : @xcite , also @xcite , find that the helical mode , if driven , grows slowly but surely , and does not saturate .",
    "instead , it continues to grow until it reaches nonlinear levels and disrupts the jet .",
    "thus , the lack of any detectable helical mode , either on sub - parsec scales or between hst-1 and knot a , suggests that any initial helical - mode perturbation to the jet must be very small .      in order to use the observed filament wavelengths to determine conditions in the jet and its surroundings , we must determine the viewing angle , the jet flow speed and the speed of the wave pattern within the jet . to this end , we take advantage of the extensive data on proper motions of radio and optical features in the jet . because we expect the kh instability to give jet flow _",
    "through _ wave patterns , we identify faster proper motions with the jet flow , and slower proper motions with a pattern speed .",
    "the similarity of the optical and radio jet filaments , and the lack of evidence for a broad velocity shear layer , make it likely that we can use the fastest observed proper motions from both bands to reliably represent the jet speed . in what follows ,",
    "we use proper motion data to develop continuous , steady - state models of the jet flow and pattern speed . by doing this",
    ", we implicitly assume that whatever causes the emission enhancement in the bright knots does not create any significant deviations from smooth flow within the jet .      to constrain the viewing angle ,",
    "we look to the fastest observed proper motions .",
    "the fastest optical proper motion implies a superluminal speed @xmath18 at the position of hst-1 @xcite .",
    "the most rapid radio proper motion implies @xmath19 @xcite at the position of hst-1 . recalling that the maximum viewing angle is given by @xmath20/[(\\beta^{\\rm ob})^2 + 1 ] $ ] , the highest optically determined",
    "superluminal speed requires a jet viewing angle @xmath21 . on the other hand",
    ", the highest radio - determined superluminal speed requires only @xmath22 .",
    "we therefore work with two models , jets at @xmath3 and @xmath4 to the line of sight , taking these as representative of limits on the jet viewing angle and the jet speed at hst-1 .      to constrain the flow speed of the jet plasma",
    ", we again look to the fastest observed proper motions .",
    "the fastest optical proper motions decline along the jet with superluminal speeds @xmath23 , and @xmath24 found at the positions of hst-1 , hst-2 , knot d , and knot e , respectively @xcite .",
    "the fastest radio proper motions also decline along the jet with speeds of @xmath19 at hst-1 @xcite and @xmath25 at knot d @xcite .",
    "we use the radio proper motion downstream of knot a , @xmath26 at knot b @xcite , to set a lower limit on the flow speed at knot a. for hst-1 and knot d we observe flow through a more slowly moving knot . thus , the fastest observed radio and optical proper motions associated with the knots suggest a flow speed which _ decreases _ along the jet between hst-1 and knot a. at a viewing angle of @xmath3 , the four optical data points spanning the @xmath27 from hst-1 to knot e require more than a @xmath28 decrease in the lorentz factor and provide the most robust evidence for a decreasing jet speed .",
    "we synthesize these data into two jet models . to represent the faster optical motions and a smaller viewing angle we work with a _ fast jet model _ with viewing angle @xmath29 and intrinsic jet full opening angle @xmath30  radian  @xmath31 .",
    "the jet lorentz factor is @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) at hst-1 , @xmath34 at knot d and @xmath35 at knot e. to represent the slower radio motions and a larger viewing angle we work with a _ slow jet model _ with @xmath36 , full opening angle @xmath37  radian  @xmath38 . in this model ,",
    "the jet lorentz factor is @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) at hst-1 , and @xmath41 at knot d. our fast and slow jet models are constrained by a lower limit to the jet lorentz factor at knot a , @xmath42 for @xmath29 and @xmath43 for @xmath36 .",
    "we return to these two jet models in section [ flow_models ] .",
    "to constrain the pattern speed , we turn to slower , subluminal , optical or radio proper motions . here",
    "our best evidence comes from the slower speeds associated with hst-1 or knot d , because these two knots provide clear evidence for jet flow through more slowly moving structures ( patterns ) , as might be expected for the kh instability .",
    "while knot d shows a broad range of motions , the average radio - determined speed for knot d is @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the story at hst-1 is more complex .",
    "the upstream edge of hst-1 has been measured to move at @xmath45 ( @xcite , optical ) , at @xmath46 ( @xcite , radio ) , and at @xmath47 ( @xcite , radio ) .",
    "in addition to the known variability of hst-1 , which makes it difficult to combine data taken at different epochs , radio data suggest the upstream edge of hst-1 may lie at the northern edge of the jet , possibly caused by an interaction between the jet and something in the external environment @xcite . we conclude that knot hst-1 is not the best choice for a pattern speed , and take the average radio - determined motion of knot d as the best available indicator of pattern speed .    to determine the evolution of pattern speed along the jet , we assume sufficiently slow spatial growth so that the filament wavelength , @xmath48 , can be related to the pattern speed by @xmath49 .",
    "we assume that the wave frequency @xmath50 is set at the filament source , somewhere upstream of hst-1 , and remains constant along the jet .",
    "the observed 50% increase in @xmath48 between hst-1 and knot a requires a 50% increase in @xmath51 over this distance .",
    "we tie this required increase to the average observed speed at knot d , @xmath52 .",
    "this choice requires `` observed '' pattern speeds of @xmath53 at hst-1 and @xmath54 at knot a , which are consistent with the ranges in the data , namely @xmath55 , at hst-1 and @xmath56 at knot a @xcite .      finally , we connect the observed pattern wavelength , @xmath57 , to the intrinsic pattern wavelength , @xmath58 , by @xmath59 figure [ obs_vs_int ] shows the intrinsic pattern speeds and wavelengths from hst-1 to knot a accompanying the observed wavelengths and observed pattern speeds for the jet at    @xmath29 and at @xmath36 . in general , the observed wavelength can be greater or less than the intrinsic wavelength depending on the intrinsic pattern speed , @xmath60 , and viewing angle , @xmath61 . for our viewing angles",
    "the intrinsic wavelength and pattern speed are greater than the observed values , and show less change along the jet than the observed values .",
    "in particular , the intrinsic wavelength , @xmath62 , increases more slowly than the jet radius , @xmath63 , so that @xmath64 decreases along the jet .",
    "this has consequences for the kh instability analysis we present in section [ kh_modes ] .",
    "in this section we develop our baseline jet models , which we need in order to analyze the behavior of the kh instability , and determine what conditions in the jet would accompany deceleration in accord with the observations . we consider a steady - state jet which conserves mass flux and is in pressure balance with an external cocoon .",
    "the cocoon acts as the ambient medium which controls the development of the kh instability .",
    "the full system conserves energy flux as the jet decelerates .",
    "we do not tackle the complex problem of what causes the jet to decelerate .",
    "instead , we parameterize our jet models to describe the extent to which energy flux is conserved in the flow .",
    "we begin with models in which energy flux is conserved within the jet , so that the jet plasma heats up as it decelerates .",
    "we also explore jets in which a small fraction of the energy flux is transfered to the cocoon , as would be expected if the jet s interaction with the cocoon is responsible for the observed jet deceleration .",
    "provided the energy lost from the jet is a small fraction of the total energy flux , both models give very similar results for the internal structure of the jet .",
    "we first consider a jet which conserves mass flux and energy flux . because the jet expands uniformly between hst-1 and knot a",
    ", we can assume flow along radial lines in spherical geometry .",
    "conservation of mass flux can be written in terms of two locations along the jet , a fiducial point at axial position @xmath65 ( with jet radius @xmath66 ) and another point at some general @xmath67 ( with jet radius @xmath63 ) : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the jet mass density ; @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the usual lorentz factor and normalized flow speed .",
    "conservation of energy flux can be written as @xmath72 where the total energy content of the plasma , the  relativistic \" enthalpy ( rest mass plus enthalpy ) , is described by @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the adiabatic index of the jet plasma .",
    "we also define the ratio of pressure to rest mass energy , @xmath75 , and the specific enthalpy , @xmath76 we note that all of the jet parameters  @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83  are functions of position along the jet .",
    "we suppress this @xmath84-dependence to lighten the notation .",
    "values for @xmath85 along an expanding jet containing relativistic plasma can vary from less than one to greater than one .",
    "the adiabatic index , @xmath74 , also changes with @xmath85 in this regime .",
    "we use the approximation @xcite @xmath86 and use this to connect @xmath85 to @xmath87 as @xmath88 the last equality defines the order - unity function @xmath89 , which has the expected limits , @xmath90 for @xmath91 , and @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "we now use equation ( [ masscon ] ) in equation ( [ energycon ] ) to rewrite energy flux conservation as @xmath94 = \\gamma_{j0}\\left [ 1+\\left ( { \\gamma_{j0 }   \\over \\gamma_{j0 } -1 } \\right ) { p_{j0 } \\over \\rho_{j0}c^{2 } } \\right]~ , \\label{allenergyconserv}\\ ] ] or @xmath95 = \\gamma_{j0 } \\left ( 1+\\chi_{j0}\\right)~ ,   \\label{energycon2}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 .",
    "this makes it apparent that a decelerating jet which conserves energy flux will heat up ( @xmath97 ) , and vice versa .",
    "we want to solve equation ( [ energycon2 ] ) to describe the flow field in the jet . in order to do this",
    "we need to connect the enthalpy , @xmath85 , to the flow field . rather than modeling the full thermodynamics of the flow , we assume a polytropic dependence between the pressure and density , @xmath98 for some ( as yet unknown ) index @xmath99 .",
    "the subscript `` ec '' denotes `` energy - conserving '' . for an expanding jet",
    ", @xmath100 describes an accelerating adiabatic jet , @xmath101 describes an isothermal jet at constant speed , and @xmath102 describes a jet which heats up as it decelerates .",
    "our polytropic assumption also gives @xmath103 and @xmath104 here @xmath105 is another order - unity function , which can be expressed in terms of @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "equations ( [ theta_polytrope ] ) and ( [ chi1_polytrope ] ) show that the thermal state of the jet ( described by @xmath108 or @xmath109 ) is uniquely related to @xmath110 , if the polytropic index @xmath99 is known .",
    "in particular , @xmath99 determines the pressure drop along the jet ( from equation [ basic_polytrope ] ) .",
    "we therefore use the data to estimate @xmath99 .",
    "two sets of evidence are available : radio data which can be used to determine the minimum pressure in the jet and x - ray data which reveal the pressure in the local ism .",
    "basic synchrotron theory can be used to find the minimum jet pressure , @xmath111 , consistent with the jet s observed luminosity and volume , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite .",
    "ohc calculated @xmath111 from their radio observations , ignoring relativistic effects .",
    "they found that @xmath111 declines by a factor @xmath112 between hst-1 and knot d , and by a further factor @xmath113 between knots d and e. because their data were obtained when hst-1 was in a quiescent state , their @xmath111 value for that knot should be typical of the underlying jet .",
    "the scatter in their @xmath111 estimates downstream of knot e suggests little additional decline to knot a , and thus an overall decline in @xmath114 by a factor of @xmath7 between hst-1 and knot a. similar calculations carried out by @xcite , including optical and x - ray data , obtained similar results .",
    "@xcite revisited @xmath111 in the jet , including relativistic effects _ via _ a beaming correction @xmath115 @xcite , where the doppler factor is @xmath116^{-1}$ ] . in section [ jet_speed ]",
    "we argued that typical jet lorentz factors @xmath117 at hst-1 , slowing to @xmath118 at knot d. these values , along with their respective viewing angles 25  and 15 , give doppler factors @xmath119 at hst-1 and @xmath120 at knot d. ( the slightly larger values at knot d are a consequence of the @xmath121 dependence in @xmath122 . )",
    "this result suggests an additional decline in @xmath123 , relative to the uncorrected estimate , of @xmath124 from hst-1 to knot a. overall , these calculations suggest that @xmath111 declines by a factor @xmath125 between hst-1 and knot a. there is , of course , no fundamental reason why the pressure of the jet plasma should be equal to @xmath111 .",
    "in particular , if the jet is only weakly magnetized , we expect @xmath126 .",
    "nonetheless , we might guess that a decline in @xmath111 approximately reflects the decline in @xmath127 .",
    "the evolving jet and cocoon need not be in pressure balance with the ambient ism and minimum pressure estimates ( section [ pressure_scaling ] ) indicate an overpressured jet .",
    "even so , it is still interesting to consider the pressure drop in the ism along the jet . on @xmath128 kpc scales ,",
    "the ism is fairly smoothly distributed , and its pressure declines smoothly with radius , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , the ism in the inner part of the galaxy is complicated ( as in section [ flow_obs ] ) , and the ism pressure probably fluctuates substantially about any large - scale trend .",
    "nonetheless , @xcite estimated a factor @xmath7 decline in the ism pressure between hst-1 and knot a which is interestingly similar to the factor @xmath125 drop in @xmath111 from the radio data .",

    "we compare the results to the values of @xmath140 at hst-1 , knot d , knot e and the lower limit to @xmath140 at knot a , then adjust @xmath107 to iterate on equation ( [ eqn_to_solve ] ) as needed , to give the best overall fit to the data for our chosen @xmath99 . finally , we use equations ( [ basic_polytrope ] ) or ( [ theta_polytrope ] ) to find the evolution of the internal energy along the jet .    in figure [ jet_flow ]",
    "we show our best fits to fast and slow energy - conserving jets .",
    "our fast jet with @xmath141 starts at hst-1 with @xmath32 and @xmath142 .",
    "by knot a it has decelerated to @xmath143 and heated to @xmath144 .",
    "this model easily fits the optical superluminal speeds and significantly exceeds the lower limit at knot a.    our slow jet with @xmath145 starts at hst-1 with @xmath39 and @xmath146 . by knot",
    "a it has decelerated to @xmath147 and heated to @xmath148 .",
    "this model is just barely acceptable ; it lies just outside the error bars associated with the fastest radio superluminal speeds at hst-1 and knot d , and just above the lower limit at knot a. we therefore treat our slow - jet model as a lower limit to the jet speed and upper limit to the viewing angle . in both fast and slow models the enthalpy rises from @xmath149 at hst-1 to @xmath150 at knot a ; the jet plasma heats as it absorbs the lost kinetic energy .",
    "the jet plasma is hot but subrelativistic , @xmath151 , at hst-1 and heats by a factor @xmath152 to @xmath153 at knot a. we do not derive numerical values for the pressure or density , but only the ratios of each quantity to its value at hst-1 ; these are also shown in figure [ jet_flow ] .",
    "although the jet decelerates , its density still drops due to the expansion , by a factor @xmath154 between hst-1 and knot a. the jet pressure is , of course , constrained by our assumptions to drop by a factor @xmath155 over the same range .",
    "solutions to equation ( [ eqn_to_solve ] ) are sensitive to the starting value of the enthalpy , @xmath107 .",
    "flows in which the jet plasma is internally relativistic at hst-1 ( @xmath156 ) decelerate very rapidly and violate the lower limit on jet speed at knot a. flows which are very cool at hst-1 ( @xmath157 ) decelerate too slowly to match the proper motions through knots d and e. specifically , we find an upper limit to the starting enthalpy , @xmath158 by considering a maximum allowed deceleration from @xmath159 at hst-1 to @xmath160 at knot a ( using the upper error bar limit , @xmath161 at hst-1 and the lower error bar limit @xmath162 at knot a ) .",
    "we also find a lower limit of @xmath163 , by considering a minimum allowed deceleration from @xmath164 at hst-1 to @xmath165 at knot e ( using the lower error bar limit , @xmath166 , at hst-1 and the upper error bar limit , @xmath167 , at knot e ) .",
    "the minimum deceleration case gives @xmath168 at knot a.      in our energy - conserving jet , all of the excess kinetic energy lost as the jet decelerates is converted into internal energy within the jet . because the jet probably decelerates through interactions with the surrounding medium",
    ", some of that excess kinetic energy may well go into the surroundings .",
    "this could happen , for instance , as a consequence of shocks driven into the cocoon by the unstable kh modes .",
    "we want to explore how such energy loss affects the kh instability .",
    "however , building a complete model of jet and ism energetics is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead , we invent a toy model to describe the effect of the energy transferred from the jet to the cocoon .    we know that the pressure in an energy - losing jet must drop more rapidly , relative to the local density , than in an energy - conserving jet .",
    "however , the `` observed '' jet pressure must still drop by a factor @xmath155 , to match our arguments in section [ pressure ] .",
    "we parameterize this as follows .",
    "we first assume that the underlying jet flow satisfies equations ( [ masscon ] ) and ( [ energycon ] ) , and the pressure also obeys a polytropic relation , but now with an `` energy - losing '' polytropic index , @xmath169 .",
    "we solve equation ( [ eqn_to_solve ] ) with this new @xmath170 , and match the solution to the observed velocities .",
    "we adopt the same lorentz factors at hst-1 ( 7.50 , fast jet , and 4.40 , slow jet ) , and at knot a ( 2.66 , fast jet and 1.82 , slow jet ) , as for an energy - conserving jet , and we again adjust @xmath107 to match these data .",
    "the values of @xmath170 and @xmath107 consistent with the observed deceleration are interrelated ; smaller values of @xmath107 accompany smaller values of @xmath170 . at this point , to ensure that the `` true '' jet pressure drops more rapidly than @xmath170 describes , we assume the `` true '' jet pressure is related to the jet density _ via _ equation ( [ basic_polytrope ] ) , but now with the energy - conserving @xmath132 .",
    "thus , we parameterize the mismatch between the `` observed '' pressure decline , and an energy - conserving pressure decline , by @xmath171 .",
    "we return to these models in section [ limiting_jets ] , where we will show that energy - losing models consistent with the data must have @xmath172 , and that models with @xmath173 differ only slightly from the energy - conserving models .",
    "in this section we determine under what conditions the twisted filaments seen in the m87 jet can be caused by the kh instability .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of the kh instability , including some useful analytic approximations ; we store more details in the appendix .",
    "we analyse our energy - conserving and energy - losing jet models , finding what conditions must exist in the cocoon if the kh - generated filaments in our model jets are to match the ones in the real jet .",
    "we show that the kh modes propagate supersonically in the jet , and verify that they grow rapidly enough to saturate close to the origin of the jet .",
    "kh stability analysis describes the growth of perturbations to the jet using solutions of the dispersion relation , equation ( [ disprel ] ) in the appendix .",
    "this equation can be solved to determine the wavelength , @xmath174 , and wave speed , @xmath175 , associated with a frequency , @xmath176 .",
    "the dispersion relation solution describes a 180  rotation of the elliptical cross section distortion , corresponding to a 180  rotation of a single filament .",
    "thus , the elliptical wave frequency and wavelength described in solutions to the dispersion relation are related to the observed frequency and wavelength by @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",

    "we estimate @xmath184  rad s@xmath185 , corresponding to a periodicity of @xmath186  yr .",
    "we assume @xmath187 is set at the filament source , somewhere upstream of hst-1 , and remains constant along the jet .",
    "we assume the jet is in pressure balance with the cocoon , as required by our kh analysis .",
    "solutions to the dispersion relation ( see details in the appendix ) depend on the flow speed and thermal state of the jet and the cocoon . in practice , at a given location along the jet , we use the jet parameters from our models in section [ flow_models ] and iterate on the cocoon parameters until we find a good solution .",
    "specifically , we begin with an initial guess for the cocoon sound speed , solve equation ( [ disprel ] ) numerically for the complex wavenumber and compute the associated wavelength @xmath188 and wave speed , @xmath189 as a function of @xmath50 over a broad frequency range .",
    "we iterate on @xmath190 until we obtain a value of @xmath191 at the wavelength @xmath192 that is within 2% of the observed values .",
    "this typically requires five to ten iterations .",
    "note that we are matching computed wavelengths and wave speeds to observed intrinsic wavelengths and wave speeds , and the frequency will be @xmath193 .",
    "we do this at seven locations along the jet : hst-1 , 2 , knot d , knot e , knot f , knot i and knot a.      kh instabilites are characterized by a resonant frequency and wavelength at which the growth rate is a maximum . in general",
    "we expect perturbations to the jet to produce structures close to this resonance . in section [ limiting_jets ]",
    "we find that the elliptical surface mode in our model jets is close to resonance .",
    "had we found the alternative  that the observed filaments were not close to resonance  our identification of the filaments with kh instability would be called into question .    while the kh dispersion relation must be solved numerically , as we do in sections [ limiting_jets ] and [ intermediate_jet ] ,",
    "analytic expressions for the resonant conditions provide insight into the numerical results .",
    "the resonant solutions , given in equations ( [ resonant_wavespeed ] ) and ( [ resonant_freq ] ) in the appendix , depend on conditions in the jet and the cocoon .",
    "these expressions can be simplified for conditions found in our numerical solutions , namely , @xmath194 . in this limit",
    "the resonant wave ( pattern ) speed becomes @xmath195 here , @xmath196 is the jet speed , @xmath197 , and @xmath198 and @xmath190 are the sound speeds in the jet and cocoon .",

    "if @xmath208 decreases , @xmath209 must decrease .",
    "but , because @xmath210 , @xmath190 must rise in order to account for the filaments in terms of a kh instability .",
    "in addition to energy - conserving jets ( section [ jet_structure_models ] ) , we want to analyze the energy - losing jets ( section [ el_jet ] ) . in the latter case",
    "the cocoon as well as the jet is involved in conservation of energy flux , so we replace equation ( [ energycon ] ) by @xmath211 where the subscript `` @xmath212 '' labels properties in the cocoon . for the energy - losing jet models , we self - consistently compute @xmath213 from equation ( [ two_phase_energy ] ) , as part of the iteration to solve for @xmath190 .",

    "we plot the spatial growth rate , @xmath283 normalized by @xmath135 , as a function of position along the jet .",
    "we find that each surface mode grows more rapidly than the accompanying body mode along the jet .",
    "the spatial growth rate of the surface modes when scaled to @xmath66 at hst-1 decreases slightly along the jet .",
    "the triangular mode growth rate is not shown in this figure , for reasons of clarity ; it lies between the rectangular    and elliptical mode growth rate .",
    "all four modes , however , are used in the pseudo - synchrotron image calculated in section [ pseudo_synch ] .",
    "figure [ spatial_growth ] also shows that surface modes will develop rapidly along the m87 jet ; growth lengths for the elliptical surface mode range from @xmath284 at hst-1 to @xmath285 at knot a. we therefore speculate that surface modes can grow to significant amplitudes .",
    "although we find that higher order surface modes initially grow more rapidly than the elliptical mode , we argue that the elliptical mode dominates in the actual m87 jet .",
    "the real jet must be bounded by an outer velocity shear layer .",
    "linear analysis shows that higher - order modes can be significantly affected , or even stabilized , by the presence of a shear layer @xcite , but the helical and elliptical surface modes remain unstable even in the presence of significant shear @xcite .",
    "in addition , simulations show that higher - order modes initially grow rapidly , but then saturate and are overwhelmed by more slowly growing , lower - order normal modes that saturate at a larger amplitude @xcite .",
    "the spatial growth rate of the helical surface mode is typically half that of the elliptical surface mode .",
    "this is enough for the helical mode to overwhelm a saturated elliptical mode , if it is excited at all .",
    "thus , any initial helical perturbation to the m87 jet must have been very tiny .",
    "we find that frequency - resonant body modes are also unstable in the inner region of the jet ( figure [ spatial_growth ] ) but they grow more slowly than surface modes .",
    "the very low growth rates of the body modes around hst-1 , and also in the outer part of the jet , occur because the body modes are near their minimum unstable frequency in these regions .",
    "complete stabilization of the body modes at all frequencies occurs between knots i and a for the fast jet model and between knots f and i for the slow jet model , because the jet is not sufficiently supersonic in those regions @xcite .",
    "based on this we argue that body modes do not develop to significant amplitudes on the m87 jet .",
    "in this section we explore an example of the possible internal state of the jet and the cocoon . recall that our models do not derive the density or pressure of either system , but only the specific internal energy of each . without definite information on the composition of the jet or cocoon plasmas , we can not go any further .",
    "however , we can gain insight by considering an example in which both the jet and cocoon contain a mix of relativistic and thermal plasmas , both scaled to the likely pressure in the m87 jet .",
    "let us consider a mixed plasma , which could describe the jet or the cocoon .",
    "let it contain `` thermal '' ions , with some temperature @xmath286 so that @xmath287 .",
    "let it also contain relativistic leptons , with @xmath288 , where @xmath289 describes the effective temperature of the leptons , normalized to @xmath290 .",
    "note this differs from the bulk flow lorentz factor of the plasma , which is much smaller .",
    "the leptons inside the jet are observed by means of their synchrotron radiation .",
    "the ions could provide charge balance with the relativistic leptons , or could represent a separate , ion - electron population . for the cocoon , the thermal component could have its origins in the galactic ism , and the relativistic component could have its origins in the jet plasma , now mixed with the inner ism and visible as the inner radio halo .",
    "our models show the plasma obeys @xmath291 , with @xmath292 . from this , @xmath293 we guess that the relativistic leptons are well separated in energy from the thermal plasma .",
    "for instance , we know the jet spectrum continues to rise down to @xmath294 mhz @xcite .",
    "if this were a low - frequency cutoff to the jet spectrum , and if the jet magnetic field @xmath295 g ( as in section [ pressure_scaling ] ) the lepton pressure would be dominated by particles at @xmath296 , so that @xmath297 .",
    "we normalize the ion temperature as @xmath298 , with no constraints on @xmath286 except that @xmath299 is required to solve equation ( [ pressure_balance ] ) . solving that equation",
    "gives @xmath300 at hst-1 , where @xmath301 , and @xmath302 , the thermal plasma dominates the number density in both jet and cocoon ( for any @xmath303 ) .",
    "the pressure ratio depends on the unconstrained factor @xmath304 ; but unless the thermal plasma is much hotter than the @xmath8  k typical of the galactic ism , both jet and cocoon pressures are dominated by the relativistic components . at knot",
    "a , where @xmath305 , the detailed numbers may change but the situation is probably the same : the densities of the cocoon and jet plasmas are dominated by the thermal component , but their pressures are dominated by the relativistic component .      up to this point",
    "our modeling has not depended on absolute values for the density or the pressure but only on the ratio of these two quantities .",
    "we can estimate the jet or cocoon densities by choosing one more parameter , namely , the jet pressure . from equation ( [ pressure_balance ] )",
    "we find that @xmath306 to estimate the pressure at our fiducial point , hst-1 , we start with the minimum - pressure estimate from ohc , @xmath307  dyn  @xmath308 . this value will be reduced a bit by the @xmath309 doppler correction , but the true jet pressure must exceed @xmath310 .",
    "we thus scale the pressure at hst-1 as @xmath311  dyn  @xmath308 .",
    "we guess that the relativistic leptons at hst-1 have @xmath312 , as above .",
    "we simply scale the relativistic component of the cocoon to @xmath313 , for lack of any better information about relativistic leptons in the cocoon .    putting in numbers ,",
    "we start at hst-1 , with @xmath301 for the jet ; this gives @xmath314 @xmath10 , and @xmath315 @xmath10 .",
    "for the cocoon at hst-1 , with @xmath316 , we get @xmath317 @xmath10 and @xmath318 @xmath10 . at knot",
    "a , our models say the pressure drops by a factor @xmath319 relative to that at hst-1 .",
    "both the jet and the cocoon have @xmath305 .",
    "if @xmath320 holds for the jet , as above , we have @xmath321 at knot a. with these numbers , the jet densities are @xmath322 @xmath10 , and @xmath323 @xmath10 . for the cocoon , we have @xmath324 @xmath10 , and @xmath325 @xmath10 at knot a. thus , our assumed cocoon is not only hot , but also tenuous and overpressured , when compared to the @xmath326 @xmath10 and @xmath8  k typical of the x - ray loud ism in the inner few kpc of the galaxy .",
    "we discuss this cocoon further in section [ invisible_cocoon ] .",
    "our models assume the plasma is only weakly magnetized , @xmath327 .",
    "numerically , this gives @xmath328 . because @xmath329 in our example , our models must also have @xmath330 . at first glance , this seems to contradict the results of stawarz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who used upper limits on inverse compton emission , together with minimum - energy analysis of the radio power , to argue @xmath331 in knot a. we note , however , that different assumptions in such modeling ( compare , e.g. , ohc ) , as well as smaller assumed viewing angles ( as in section [ jet_speed ] ) can accomodate a weaker field throughout the jet .",
    "in addition , stawarz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) assumed the magnetic field and relativistic leptons coexist uniformly throughout the jet .",
    "if , alternatively , the magnetic field is enhanced at and beyond knot a , or is strong only in localized structures ( say a thin surface layer around the jet , or the knots within the jet ) , the _ inner _ jet may still have @xmath330 throughout most of its volume , in accord with our models .",
    "we can also compute the total jet power ( energy flux ) in terms of the pressure at hst-1 . in section [ ec_jet ] through section [ el_jet ]",
    "we worked with the total energy flow down the jet ( equations [ energycon ] or [ two_phase_energy ] ) .",
    "however , when considering the power the jet can deposit in its surroundings , the `` usable '' energy ( kinetic plus internal , omitting rest mass energy of the plasma particles ) is more germane .",
    "thus , we write the jet power in the absence of significant magnetic energy as @xcite @xmath332~.\\ ] ] the first term in square brackets is the `` useful '' kinetic energy of the flow ; the second term is the internal energy .",
    "this equation can also be written as @xmath333~. \\label{jet_power}\\ ] ] because our jet models are mildly relativistic ( @xmath334 a few ) , and have @xmath335 , both kinetic and internal energies contribute significantly to the total jet power .",
    "let us evaluate equation ( [ jet_power ] ) at hst-1 , where @xmath336  cm and @xmath337dyn @xmath308 . for our fast jet , with @xmath338 and @xmath339 , we get @xmath340 erg s@xmath185 . for our slow jet , with @xmath341 and @xmath342 , we get @xmath343 erg s@xmath185 .",
    "these values are more or less consistent with estimates for the m87 jet power in the literature , which range from @xmath344 erg s@xmath185 , required to drive the weak shocks associated with the present jet activity @xcite , to @xmath345 erg s@xmath185 , based either on the energy required to expand the inner lobes into the surrounding ism over a @xmath346  1  myr lifetime @xcite , or on the minimum jet power required at knot a as derived from synchrotron theory ( as in section [ pressure ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we illustrate the effects of the kh modes on the appearance of a jet by producing a model image which we compare to the real m87 jet .",
    "we choose the fast - intermediate - case jet model as being the most likely scenario for the real jet .",
    "we compute the intrinsic pressure and velocity structure along a jet with a mix of helical , elliptical , triangular and rectangular surface modes , chosen so that the elliptical surface mode dominates the structure .",
    "we use these results to generate a pseudo - synchrotron intensity image that includes all differential doppler boosting and light travel time effects associated with the relativistically moving pressure and velocity structures .",
    "we view this model jet as being `` representative '' of a jet like that in m87 , but have not attempted to create an exact match to the real jet .",
    "we compute the pressure and velocity flow fields associated with relativistically moving normal mode structures in the limit of weakly non - linear , adiabatic compressions . to do this ,",
    "we need expressions for the spatial structures of the perturbations associated with each kh mode . in the linear regime",
    "the displacement amplitude of the jet surface associated with a normal mode obeys @xmath347~,\\ ] ] where @xmath348 is the amplitude at @xmath65 of a sinusoidal displacement to the jet s surface , @xmath349 is the spatial growth rate for that mode ( figure [ spatial_growth ] ) , and @xmath350 is `` the number of growth lengths along the jet . ''",
    "we use the expressions found in section 3 of @xcite to calculate the pressure and velocity fluctuations .",
    "these grow more slowly than the surface displacement , according to @xmath351 rather than @xmath352 , because the displacement amplitude as a fraction of the jet s radius governs the magnitude of velocity and pressure fluctuations .",
    "thus , for constant jet expansion , @xmath353 \\over \\left [ 1 + ( z - z_{j0})\\psi / r_{j0 } \\right]}~ , \\label{spatial_growth}\\ ] ] where @xmath354 and @xmath136 is the half opening angle of the jet .",
    "the small opening angles in our models , @xmath355 ( where @xmath29 or @xmath4 is the viewing angle ) , are significantly less than the relativistic mach angle , @xmath356 at hst-1 , as is required for self - consistency . the spatial growth length , @xmath357 , for the elliptical surface mode between hst-1 and knot a when rescaled to the jet s radius at hst-1 increases from @xmath358 to @xmath359 . for a typical value of @xmath360  pc , pressure and velocity fluctuations grow by an order of magnitude in @xmath361  pc .",
    "we have explored a number of different mixes for four lower - order kh modes ( helical , elliptical , triangular , rectangular ) using spatial growth rates for the fast - intermediate - case jet model to evaluate equation ( [ spatial_growth ] ) .",
    "our goal is not to reproduce the m87 jet exactly but to generate the most educational example . to do this we have arbitrarily capped helical and elliptical modes at an identical amplitude so that the pressure fluctuation induced by the helical mode is about 50% of that induced by the elliptical mode .",
    "we also cap the triangular and rectangular modes at a smaller amplitude , to create a pressure fluctuation also about 50% of that induced by the elliptical mode . with these amplitudes",
    "the combined modes produce a maximum pressure fluctuation comparable to the pressure field in the unperturbed jet , i.e. , @xmath362 .",
    "this is consistent with simulations @xcite which show that the linearized equations satisfactorily model the pressure and velocity structure in the simulations at this fluctuation level .",
    "our results are shown in figure [ fluc_amplitudes ] .",
    "the top panel indicates how rapidly a small initial perturbation with amplitude @xmath363 at hst-1 would grow to our amplitude caps on the m87 jet for frequency - resonant helical , elliptical , triangular and rectangular surface modes .",

    "thus , @xmath366 is a `` radial '' velocity component in cylindrical coordinates and @xmath367 is a toroidal velocity component .",
    "the results illustrate the complex structure that can result from multiple mode superpositions .",
    "the dominant wavelength of the pressure fluctuation , increasing along the jet but typically @xmath294 pc , is the wavelength of the elliptical surface mode corresponding to a @xmath368 rotation of the elliptical distortion to the jet s cross section .",
    "variation in the fluctuations comes from beating between the different wavelengths and wave speeds associated with the other kh modes .",
    "the strongest pressure fluctuations occur near the jet s surface .",
    "the velocity fluctuation in the axial direction , @xmath369 , is small .",
    "the modest increase in `` radial '' velocity , @xmath370 , towards the jet surface indicates jet expansion .",
    "there is more fluctuation in radial @xmath370 and toroidal @xmath371 motion near the jet s surface .      in order to image our model jet ,",
    "we create a three - dimensional , cartesian , data cube which we use in a modified version of radio @xcite .",
    "each grid element in the data cube is derived from the density , pressure and velocity values we calculate throughout the jet , as in figure [ fluc_amplitudes ] .",
    "these values are suitably corrected for all light - travel - time effects associated with relativistically moving structures seen at a viewing angle of 15 .",
    "we use a pseudo - synchrotron emissivity , based on standard synchrotron theory for a power - law distribution of relativistic lepton energies , with doppler boosting included : @xmath372 here , @xmath373 is the volume emissivity per hz ; the spectral index @xmath374 ( appropriate for the m87 jet in the radio band ; frazer owen , private communication 2009 ) is taken as constant .",
    "this expression assumes the leptons are coupled to the total mass density in the jet , are subject only to adiabatic compression , and ignores radiative losses and _ in situ _ energization . @xcite",
    "have shown that equation ( [ pseudo_synch ] ) provides an acceptable image of jet structure in many cases when the relativistic particles are not tracked explicitly .",
    "we assume the field strength obeys @xmath375 , for a passive , disordered magnetic field .",
    "we take @xmath376 , to describe the pressure decline in our intermediate - case model jet , and on average the emissivity drops according to @xmath377 .",
    "adiabatic pressure fluctuations obey @xmath378 around the local values , where @xmath379 ( equation [ g_approx ] ) .",
    "thus , a factor @xmath380 pressure increase towards the outer edge of the jet in a filament ( figure [ fluc_amplitudes ] ) increases the local emissivity , relative to the mean value , by @xmath381 , thus by a factor @xmath382 .",
    "we present our model image in figure [ pseudo_image ] .",
    "the upper panel shows the basic image , with intensity levels indicated by color scale and contour levels .",
    "the lower panels show slices across the model jet at ten locations along the jet . at a fixed spatial location , the filaments would rotate temporally in the clockwise direction when viewed towards the central engine by an observer , corresponding to a clockwise spatial twist of the filaments when viewed from the central engine outwards .",
    "if the opposite twist were used the transverse asymmetry seen in figure [ pseudo_image ] would be reversed .",
    "the importance of relativistic aberration and jet orientation is illustrated by comparing figure [ illustrate_kh ] to figure [ pseudo_image ] .",
    "the jet in figure [ illustrate_kh ] , chosen to illustrate the intrinsic nature of the kh elliptial mode , is at rest in the plane of the sky .",
    "the jet in figure [ pseudo_image ] has a similar intrinsic pressure structure , dominated by the elliptical mode , but it is moving relativistically and sits at @xmath3 to the line of sight .",
    "the differences in its appearance , compared to the jet in figure [ illustrate_kh ] , are due to its speed , orientation and the presence of additional dynamically significant kh modes .      while our model jet image is not tuned to reproduce the m87 jet , we gain considerable insight by comparing our model jet to the 15-ghz image of the m87 jet in figure [ jet_inner ] of this paper (",
    "also figures 5 , 6 and 7 of ohc ) , and the nuv image of @xcite .",
    "our model image shows some of the features seen in the real image , but differs revealingly in others .    along the model jet",
    "the average intensity drops by a factor @xmath383 between @xmath384 and @xmath385 .",
    "this drop is much less than might be expected for an expanding jet which does not decelerate . in a constant - speed jet ,",
    "expansion by a factor @xmath386 between @xmath384 and @xmath385 would cause the density to drop by a factor @xmath387 , and the pressure to drop adiabatically by @xmath388 , leading to a drastic decline in the synchrotron emissivity .",
    "our intensity decline is still somewhat more than in the radio image of the real m87 jet ; in figure [ jet_inner ] the jet intensity measured between the bright knots drops by a factor @xmath113 between hst-1 and knot a. possible reasons for this difference not accounted for in equation ( 26 ) include a slower decline with expansion in an ordered magnetic field and continuous _ in situ _ energization near to the jet s surface decoupling the radiating leptons from the dynamical density and pressure field",
    ". these combined effects could lead to the observed slower overall intensity decline and to the observed limb brightening which requires an emissivity from the outer @xmath389 of the jet @xmath390 times higher than that of the inner part of the jet ( see ohc ) .    our model image and the accompanying slices convey an overall impression of filaments wrapping around the jet .",
    "the twisted filaments can also be traced in the slices in figure [ pseudo_image ] .",
    "the four slices from @xmath391 to @xmath392 show winding filaments which brighten alternately at the top and bottom edge of the jet , but followed by rapid spatial change from @xmath392 to @xmath393 .",
    "various different transverse structures are illustrated by the slices from @xmath394 to @xmath395 including an overall decline in intensity and lack of sharp filament structure beyond @xmath396 .",
    "for comparison , filaments in the real jet are narrower than those in our image and cross the jet at a more oblique angle , e.g. , profiles across the real jet ( in ohc ) , from @xmath397 to @xmath398 .",
    "the model image is much more asymmetric past @xmath399 than the real jet , with the upper half of the model image being @xmath400 times brighter than the lower half . in large part",
    "this is a result of one elliptical filament being much brighter than the other .",
    "the brighter elliptical filament can easily be traced in the intensity image in figure [ pseudo_image ] as it has produced bright spots along the jet top .",
    "this filament completes a @xmath401 wrap between @xmath402 , again between @xmath403 , yet again between @xmath404 , and finally again between @xmath405 .",
    "the filament twists around the jet with wavelength varying from @xmath406 along the jet in agreement with the results from lhe .",
    "the second elliptical filament comes over the jet top about midway between the bright spots associated with the first filament and no bright spots are apparent .",
    "the difference between the two filaments occurs because the pressure structure accompanying the included helical mode adds pressure to one elliptical filament and subtracts from the other . in the real jet",
    "the two filaments are comparable and no bright spots are seen along the top edge .",
    "the model image leads us to conclude that the helical mode on the real jet must be at very low amplitude and dynamically insignificant inside knot a in order for both filaments to be comparable .",
    "the model image requires a somewhat lower elliptical amplitude in order to reduce the bright spots along the jet top that are not seen on the real jet . in our model image",
    "low - level triangular and rectangular modes add some complexity , as expected from figure [ fluc_amplitudes ] , and make it more similar to the real jet .",
    "note that our model emissivity is assumed to have no radial dependence other than that caused by the kh instability .",
    "the diminished emissivity in the inner 80% of the real jet would also lead to differences between the model and real jet images .",
    "even with elimination of the helical mode and reduced amplitude for the elliptical mode , our model image would still show an asymmetry .",
    "the asymmetry is not due to flow around the helix ; figure [ fluc_amplitudes ] shows that transverse velocity fluctuations , @xmath407 , are too small to produce significant differential doppler boosting .",
    "rather , the asymmetry accompanies any helical pattern projected on the sky plane .",
    "the amount of asymmetry depends on the speed of the helix and its radius relative to its wavelength",
    ". the helix appears symmetric if viewed close to the critical angle , @xmath408 , but becomes progressively more asymmetric as the viewing angle moves away from @xmath409 ( perucho et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in the model image",
    "the asymmetry is minimal in the inner @xmath410 where the filament winds around the jet surface and @xmath411 .",
    "however , with our viewing angle @xmath412 , the asymmetry becomes evident at larger distance when , @xmath413 and cusps appear along the jet top beginning at about @xmath414 .",
    "there is some indication of this behavior on the real jet beyond knot f. at about the position of knot a our helical filaments would loop back on themselves at the top of the jet and this behavior might be indicated by the complicated structure of knot a in the real jet ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the real jet contains bright knots inside the jet edges , which are not associated with filament crossings , and appear to be features internal to the jet rather than on its surface .",
    "the knots in the real jet are enhanced in the radio image by a similar factor of @xmath415 compared to the fainter interknot background , but are relatively brighter and more compact in the optical image .",
    "our model image shows that these bright knots in the real jet can not be the result of twisting kh modes .",
    "the apparent knot location inside the real jet , and the fact that details of knot structure change with the observing band , suggest that an additional mechanism is operating in the jet interior .",
    "we have presented a model in which the dual , helically twisted filaments in the inner m87 jet are caused by the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability .",
    "we based our model on the qualitative similarity between the observed filaments and the likely development ",
    "linear growth and nonlinear saturation  of the kh elliptical surface mode .",
    "the model was developed in three stages .",
    "we first constructed baseline , steady - state jet models .",
    "we then carried out a kh analysis of the baseline models .",
    "finally , we created a pseudo - synchrotron image of kh modes in a representative model jet , and compared it to the real jet in m87 . in this section",
    "we summarize the key results of each step of our analysis .",
    "proper motions of bright features in the jet are consistent with a faster jet flow moving through a slower wave pattern . based on these data , we modelled the ( unperturbed ) inner jet as a weakly magnetized , relativistic , steady - state flow , oriented at @xmath416 to the line of sight , and found the following .",
    "_ the jet flow decelerates between hst-1 and knot a_. it begins with @xmath417 at hst-1 , and slows to @xmath418 by knot a. this deceleration is ( almost ) directly observed in the superluminal proper motions of the faster bits of the bright knots .",
    "the range of @xmath70 values reflects variation in reported proper motions and uncertainty in the viewing angle .    _",
    "the wave ( pattern ) accelerates along the same part of the jet_. this is required by the observed increase in filament wavelength along the jet ( from lhe ) , and is consistent with subluminal proper motions detected in slower bits of the bright knots .    _",
    "the jet plasma is internally hot but subrelativistic_. if the jet conserves mass and energy as it decelerates , its internal energy must be subrelativistic with @xmath419 at hst-1 and heating to @xmath420 by knot a. a modest ( @xmath421 ) loss of energy from the jet flow to a surrounding cocoon does not significantly change this result .",
    "thus , although the jet is detected by means of the highly relativistic leptons ( @xmath422 ) responsible for its synchrotron radiation , its internal energy is dominated by a substantially ( @xmath423 ) cooler component .",
    "we analyzed the kh instability of our steady - state jet models .",
    "our analysis requires that the jet be in pressure balance with a surrounding `` cocoon '' .",
    "we determined what conditions must exist in this cocoon in order to account for the observed filaments in terms of the kh elliptical surface mode without any assumptions about how close to resonance the kh elliptical mode might be .",
    "our results from this analysis are as follows .",
    "_ the jet is surrounded by a hot cocoon .",
    "_ the cocoon must be denser and cooler than the jet , but still quite hot compared to the galactic ism . at hst-1 the cocoon must have @xmath424 ; its mass density must be @xmath425 times that of the jet . by knot",
    "a it must have @xmath426 , and its mass density must be comparable to that of the jet .",
    "these results are not derived from thermal modeling of the cocoon , but rather are required ( through the solution of the kh dispersion relation ) in order to match the increase in filament wavelength observed along the jet .    _ the filaments are kh instabilities close to resonance . _ the wavelength of the filaments and the estimated wave speed are found to be close to the resonant ( fastest growing ) wavelength expected for the kh instability under the conditions we derived for the jet and the cocoon .",
    "this was not assumed a priori . because we expect random perturbations to couple to the system s resonant frequency , we take this as circumstantial evidence supporting our hypothesis that the filaments in the m87 jet are produced by kh instability .    _",
    "the filaments are saturated kh elliptical modes_. we determined growth rates for the kh modes , and verified that they are rapid enough for the observed filaments to have developed by the position of hst-1 . because our model is based on a linear analysis , we can not analytically predict the level at which the kh modes will saturate . however , we suggest the elliptical surface mode is responsible for the filaments , because that mode is the most likely to dominate in the nonlinear stage without disrupting the jet .",
    "the lack of any detectable helical twisting between the core and knot a requires that any helical perturbation to the jet be very small .",
    "we created a pseudo - synchrotron image of one of our fast - jet models , which was modified to include helical through rectangular kh surface wave modes .",
    "the image took light - travel - time and relativistic wave motion into account for our assumed viewing angle .",
    "we did not attempt to match specific features in the real jet , but comparison between our model image and the real image revealed the following .    _",
    "the surface brightness along the model jet declines more rapidly than in the real jet but much less so than in adiabatic expansion .",
    "_ this is directly due to our assumption that the jet plasma decelerates between hst-1 and knot a and energy flux is conserved .",
    "the deceleration and conversion of flow to internal energy offsets the radial expansion of the jet , and keeps the psuedo - synchrotron emissivity high .",
    "the less rapid decline in the real jet indicates that additional in situ processes must be operating .    _",
    "the twisted filament structure in the model jet differs from that in the real jet_. the filaments in the real jet appear more symmetric and are narrower than those in the model jet . on average the model jet filaments",
    "are brighter along one edge due to the angle at which the helically twisted filaments are viewed .",
    "one of the two filaments in the model jet has been overly enhanced by the inclusion of the helical surface mode .",
    "this indicates that any helical perturbation to the jet inside knot a must be very small or nonexistent .",
    "the real jet is more limb brightened , especially in the radio , than is the model jet .",
    "this suggests that additional processes are involved in the appearance of the real jet on the edge of the flow .    _",
    "the bright knots in the real jet are not produced in the model jet . _",
    "the bright knots in the model jet that lie along one edge are due to the angle at which the helically twisted filaments are viewed and to the inclusion of the helical surface mode .",
    "the bright knots in the real jet tend to have a more complex structure than those in the model jet , and also tend to lie inside the jet .",
    "this indicates that additional processes not associated with kh instability are involved in the real jet inside the flow .",
    "how might our model fit within the larger picture of what is known about the inner m87 jet and its environment ?",
    "specifically , let us consider the presence of a hot cocoon , the origin of the knots , and the disruption of the jet past knot a.      a key part of our analysis is the existence of a hot , tenuous , high - pressure cocoon surrounding the inner jet in m87 .",
    "such a cocoon must exist if the filaments in the jet are caused by the kh instability .",
    "specifically , our models require the cocoon to satisfy @xmath427 , which is substantially hotter than the @xmath8k typical of the inner ism .",
    "our specific example , in section [ scaling ] , suggests a cocoon density @xmath428 times lower than the inner ism at hst-1 , and @xmath429 times lower than the inner ism at knot a.    at first glance this requirement seems to contradict the data , because no such cocoon has been detected ; but it may be hard to see .",
    "any x - ray detection of the cocoon would be indirect ; it is too tenuous , and possibly too hot , to be x - ray bright .",
    "it could appear as a `` hole '' in an x - ray image , but the wealth of loops , filaments and cavities in the inner x - ray region @xcite could easily hide such a structure .",
    "direct detection of the cocoon in the radio is equally difficult , because uncertainties in relativistic particle energy and magnetic field in the cocoon make predictions of its radio brightness elusive .",
    "figure [ jet_large ] shows that the observed radio halo is relatively faint around the inner jet .",
    "this could mean that the region immediately around the jet is more tenuous than elsewhere in the radio halo , or has a weaker magnetic field , or that the radiating leptons have suffered significant losses .",
    "these possibilities are consistent with our hypothetical cocoon , but by no means confirm its existence .",
    "a hint of a low - density cocoon may come from the faraday rotation , which is substantially lower along the jet than elsewhere in the inner radio lobes @xcite .",
    "while this could be simply due to projection if the jet lies in front of most of the inner ism , it could also indicate a low - density region local to the jet .",
    "another possible concern comes from the requirement that the cocoon be at a higher pressure than the local ism .",
    "interpreting the filaments as being kh generated requires the cocoon to be in pressure balance with the jet ; but the minimum pressure of the jet , @xmath111 , from synchrotron analysis , is higher than the typical pressure of the inner ism .",
    "it follows that the jet - cocoon system can not be in a steady state ; it must be dynamic , and expanding outwards into the local ism .",
    "this seems consistent with the evidence that the ism immediately surrounding the jet is disordered and turbulent ( as in section [ flow_obs ] ) .",
    "the jet itself is clearly the driver for the inner ism .",
    "it is depositing mass and energy directly into the inner radio halo ( as in figure [ jet_large ] ) and our models suggest it can be shedding significant energy into its immediate cocoon .",
    "yet another concern might be the origin of such a cocoon and why it is so much hotter around knot a than at hst-1 .",
    "while our model does not address this issue , we note that the relativistic plasma from the jet is likely to have mixed with the ambient ism .",
    "such mixing is directly suggested by the existence of the radio halo ( as in figure [ jet_large ] ) , and is consistent with our example of jet and cocoon composition in section [ scaling ] .",
    "we speculate that relativistic plasma from the jet is mixed with the ambient plasma as the jet propagates outward through the galactic ism . over time , the changing spatial location of the primary mixing and heating region might lead to the required temperature and sound speed increase in the cocoon from hst-1 to knot a.      there are two important differences between the real jet and our model image . the real jet",
    "displays the well - known bright knots , which appear to be internal to the jet ( as seen in projection ) and not coincident with filament crossings",
    ". our model jet does not have such complex bright knots .",
    "in addition , the real jet is limb brightened when seen in the radio , but our model jet is not .",
    "these differences between the real jet and the model suggest that the jet plasma is being energized _ in situ _ , in the bright knots as well as at the edge of the jet .",
    "this is not a new argument .",
    "the radiative lifetimes of relativistic leptons emitting x - ray synchrotron emission are too short for the particles to survive the transit from the core out to knot a. this result comes directly from the strong galactic starlight @xcite , and holds for any plausible magnetic field in the jet .",
    "it follows that the x - ray - loud leptons must undergo local reacceleration throughout the jet .",
    "we think it likely that lower - energy particles radiating in optical and radio , are also locally energized by the same processes .",
    "spectral behavior along the jet",
    "( e.g. perlman & wilson 2005 , also f. owen , private communication 2009 ) requires that the acceleration mechanism , whatever it is , maintain an approximately constant lepton spectrum throughout the jet .    one obvious possibility for _ in situ",
    "_ energization is the kh instability itself .",
    "we showed in section [ intermediate_jet ] that the wave speed is supersonic throughout the jet .",
    "thus , the twisted filaments provide a continuous pair of twisted shocks , and possible particle acceleration near the jet surface , from hst-1 to knot i. in addition , velocity shear at the edge of the jet may amplify the magnetic fields there , locally enhancing the synchrotron emissivity close to the edge .",
    "if this is the case , the weaker limb brightening in the optical , as compared to the radio , must be due to a relatively low , high - energy cutoff of the particle distribution near the jet surface .",
    "however , edge effects are not likely to be the full answer . in general",
    ", the knots appear located within the jet , not close to its edge ( although the hst-1 flaring region was at the jet edge ) , and contain compact , bright emission regions when seen in the optical or nuv .",
    "thus , the data strongly suggest that energization internal to the jet is also an important part of the picture .",
    "this is unsurprising , because the jet is supersonic from hst-1 to knot i , and very likely to contain internal shocks .",
    "shocks could arise because the jet flow is unsteady ; this is evident from the variability of the knots , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "shocks could also arise as the jet propagates through the turbulent ism in the galactic core .",
    "particle acceleration at internal shocks could very plausibly create the bright knots seen in the radio , optical and x - ray .",
    "we can use our model to speculate on the behavior of the jet downstream of knot a. radio images ( see figure [ jet_large ] ) show the jet narrows , and its centerline oscillates , between knots a and c. our models find the jet is hot and relatively slow at knot a , with sound speed @xmath430 and lorentz factor @xmath431 .",
    "if knot a is a shock , the sound speed would be higher and the lorentz factor would be lower immediately post - shock . in a linear analysis , at a fixed pressure fluctuation ,",
    "the transverse fluid displacement associated with a kh mode is larger on a weakly supersonic , weakly relativistic jet than it is on a highly supersonic and highly relativistic jet @xcite .",
    "thus , the narrowing of the jet past knot a where the flow could be weakly supersonic and weakly relativistic might be associated with significant elliptical distortion of the jet s cross section associated with the elliptical surface mode of the kh instability .    in addition , the highly collimated jet flow disrupts significantly downstream of knot c. as we noted in section [ kh_intro ] , the kh helical mode does not saturate but grows in amplitude until the jet decollimates .",
    "we speculate that a slowly growing , long - wavelength helical mode is what disrupts the jet downstream of knot a. to test this idea , even with a discontinuity at knot a , we can estimate the downstream development of the kh instability in terms of flow conditions at knot a. on a weakly supersonic jet , kh stability analysis shows that the supersonic resonance moves to very high frequencies and very short wavelengths .",
    "in this situation the development of kh surface modes can be estimated from the solution of equation ( [ low_freq_dr ] ) , using @xmath432 .",
    "our models at knot a ( e.g. , table 2 ) have @xmath433 , also @xmath434 , @xmath435 and @xmath436 . with these numbers , the growth length for the helical surface mode , @xmath437 , is no more than a few jet radii .",
    "noting that @xmath438 pc at knot a , a helical perturbation there will grow by an order of magnitude in @xmath439 pc . for comparison ,",
    "the distance from knot a to knot c is @xmath440  kpc with the jet at a @xmath3 viewing angle .",
    "thus , our results suggest that destabilization and decollimation of the m87 jet beyond knot a is determined by conditions in the jet before it reaches that point . with minimal energy flux lost from the jet ,",
    "the decelerating jet flow must heat up ; the cocoon must also heat in order to account for the observed helical filaments .",
    "these conditions lead to rapid growth of the kh helical mode , and consequent jet disruption , past knot a.    our goal in this paper has been to uncover properties of the m87 jet and its surroundings by assuming the kh instability is responsible for the twisted filaments seen in the jet .",
    "it is illuminating to compare our conclusions here to those of a similar analysis of the 3c120 jet @xcite .",
    "bright knots and inter - knot emission in the 3c120 jet on scales of hundreds of pc , suggest conical jet flow and a more slowly moving short wavelength helically twisted filament which is consistent with a short wavelength helical surface mode .",
    "the observed behavior of this mode in 3c120 requires a cooling , modestly accelerating flow along the expanding jet . under these conditions",
    ", @xcite argued that the 3c120 jet is stabilized to kh disruption by saturation and the declining growth rate of the short - wavelength mode along the jet .",
    "their result explains how the 3c120 jet can remain highly collimated to hundreds of kpc from the central engine .",
    "by contrast , in this paper we find a different result for the m87 jet .",
    "we suggest that heating of the m87 jet as it decelerates allows the kh helical mode to grow significantly downstream of knot a , leading to jet disruption only a few kpc from the central engine .",
    "we thank andrei lobanov for his analysis of the m87 jet filaments which provided the initial motivation for this study , and frazer owen for providing the 15 ghz vla images and unpublished results on the radio - band spectral index of the jet .",

    "<S> our model requires the jet to be an internally hot , but subrelativistic plasma , from hst-1 to knot a. subsequently we assume that the jet is in pressure balance with an external cocoon and we determine the cocoon conditions required if the twisted filaments are the result of the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) unstable elliptical mode . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the cocoon must be cooler than the jet at hst-1 but must be about as hot as the jet at knot a. under these conditions we find that the observed filament wavelength is near the elliptical mode maximum growth rate and growth is rapid enough for the filaments to develop and saturate well before hst-1 . </S>",
    "<S> we generate a pseudo - synchrotron image of a model jet carrying a combination of normal modes of the kh instability . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudo - synchrotron image of the jet reveals : ( 1 ) that a slow decline in the model jet s surface brightness is still about five times faster than the real jet ; ( 2 ) that kh produced dual helically twisted filaments can appear qualitatively similar to those on the real jet if any helical perturbation to the jet is very small or nonexistent inside knot a ; ( 3 ) that the knots in the real jet can not be associated with the twisted filamentary features and are unlikely to be the result of a kh instability . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the knots in the real jet , the limb brightening of the real jet in the radio , and the slower decline of the surface brightness of the real jet indicate that additional processes  such as unsteady jet flow and internal particle acceleration  are occurring within the jet . </S>",
    "<S> disruption of the real jet beyond knot a by kh instability is consistent with the jet and cocoon conditions we find at knot a.    12 pt </S>"
