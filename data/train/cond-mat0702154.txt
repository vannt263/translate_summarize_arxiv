    "it has been firmly established in experiments with ultracold vapors of alkali metals that bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with weak attractive interactions between atoms ( characterized by negative scattering length ) can form stable matter - wave solitons in nearly one - dimensional ( 1d )  cigar - shaped \" traps , which tightly confine the condensate in two transverse directions , but leave it almost free along the longitudinal axis .",
    "this setting has made it possible to create stable bright solitons strecker02,khaykovich02 and trains of such solitons @xcite in the @xmath3li condensate , where the interaction between atoms may be made weakly attractive by means of the feshbach - resonance technique . in the @xmath9rb condensate trapped under similar conditions ,",
    "stronger attraction between atoms leads to the creation of nearly 3d solitons in a post - collapse state @xcite .",
    "this experimentally relevant setting is described by effectively 1d equations which were derived , by means of various approximations , from the full 3d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite-@xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the deviation of the effective equation from the straightforward one - dimensional gpe with the cubic nonlinearity is adequately accounted for by an extra self - attractive quintic term , which may essentially affect the solitons @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the 1d equation starts with adopting an ansatz factorizing the 3d wave function into the product of a transverse one ( which amounts to the ground state of the 2d harmonic oscillator ) and slowly varying axial ( one - dimensional ) wave function .",
    "the substitution of this _ ansatz _ in the variational approximation ( va ; a review of the method can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) leads , without resorting to additional approximations , to a _ nonpolynomial schrdinger equation _ ( npse ) for the longitudinal wave function @xcite .",
    "this equation was successfully used in various physical contexts @xcite . in particular , the above - mentioned simplified equation including cubic and quintic terms",
    "can then be obtained by an expansion of the npse for the case of a relatively weak nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the npse for a two - component bec was recently developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the form of a coupled system of npses .",
    "the objective of this work is to analyze the dynamics of quasi-1d solitons in the cigar - shaped trap equipped with a periodic potential , which can be easily created as an _ optical lattice _ ( ol ) , by means of two coherent counterpropagating laser beams illuminating the condensate ( for a recent review of the bec dynamics in periodic potentials , see ref .",
    "solitons in the 1d nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) with the ordinary self - focusing cubic nonlinearity and periodic ( lattice ) potential had been studied some time ago @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a stable soliton can be trapped by a local potential minimum of the ol .",
    "on the other hand , stable quasi-1d solitons in cigar - shaped traps exist up to a certain threshold , beyond which they suffer _ collapse_. the occurrence of the collapse in the effective 1d equation reflects the presence of the collapse in the underlying 3d setting @xcite . a new feature , which the present paper aims to report and explore , is the influence of the periodic potential on the collapse threshold for solitons in the quasi-1d trap .",
    "we demonstrate that , for both single - peak solitons found in the semi - infinite gap of the periodic potential , and multi - peaked solitons found in finite bandgaps , the collapse threshold gradually _ goes down _ with the increase of the potential strength .",
    "this feature may be explained by the fact that a sufficiently strong axial ol potential collects almost all the condensate in a limited space of a single lattice cell , thus facilitating the onset of the collapse .",
    "the predicted effect should be amenable to observation by means of standard experimental techniques .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we apply the va directly to the description of solitons in the underlying 3d gpe . in this way , the collapse threshold for the quasi-1d solitons is predicted in a semi - analytical form [ in the same approximation , the stability of the solitons is estimated by means of the vakhitov - kolokolov ( vk )  criterion ] . in section iii , we derive the one - dimensional npse in the presence of the periodic potential , and find soliton families as numerical solutions of the latter equation . comparison with direct numerical solutions of the underlying 3d  gpe demonstrates that the npse provides for very high accuracy in the prediction of both the shape of the solitons belonging to the semi - infinite gap and their collapse threshold ; the accuracy provided by the va is lower , but nevertheless reasonable too . in section iv",

    "<S> within the framework of the mean - field description , we investigate atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , with attraction between atoms , under the action of strong transverse confinement and periodic ( optical - lattice , ol ) axial potential . using a combination of the variational approximation ( va ) , one - dimensional ( 1d ) nonpolynomial schrdinger equation ( npse ) , and direct numerical solutions of the underlying 3d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ground state of the condensate is a soliton belonging to the semi - infinite bandgap of the periodic potential . </S>",
    "<S> the soliton may be confined to a single cell of the lattice , or extend to several cells , depending on the effective self - attraction strength , @xmath0 ( which is proportional to the number of atoms bound in the soliton ) , and depth of the potential , @xmath1 , the increase of @xmath1 leading to strong compression of the soliton . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the ol is an effective tool to control the soliton s shape . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that , due to the 3d character of the underlying setting , the ground - state soliton collapses at a critical value of the strength , @xmath2 , which gradually decreases with the increase of the depth of the periodic potential , @xmath1 ; under typical experimental conditions , the corresponding maximum number of @xmath3li atoms in the soliton , @xmath4 , ranges between @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> examples of stable multi - peaked solitons are also found in the first finite bandgap of the lattice spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the respective critical value @xmath7 again slowly decreases with the increase of @xmath1 , corresponding to @xmath8 . </S>"
