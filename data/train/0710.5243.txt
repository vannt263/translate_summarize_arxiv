    "recently , astrophysical observational programmes monitoring compact stars ( cs ) have provided new , high - quality data for the static properties as well as the thermal and spin evolution which put tight constraints on the equation of state ( eos ) and transport properties of dense matter in cs interiors @xcite . in particular , circumstantial evidence for large masses and radii of compact stars",
    "@xcite suggests that the eos at high densities must be rather stiff , possibly excluding quark matter interiors . in this debate",
    ", it has been demonstrated that modern eos for quark matter allow for extended quark matter cores of cs while satisfying mass and radius constraints @xcite .",
    "the resulting stiff hybrid star eos suffers , however , from the _ masquerade _ problem @xcite : the corresponding hybrid stars appear to have almost identical static properties when compared with pure neutron stars .    a diagnostic tool more sensible than the eos are the thermal and transport properties of dense matter which determine , e.g. , the cooling and spin evolution of cs .",
    "if quark matter occurs in cs interiors we expect it to be in a color superconducting state which entails a dramatic dependence on the pairing pattern and the sizes of pairing gaps . in this contribution , we will focus on the discussion of direct urca neutrino emissivities and bulk viscosities of color superconducting quark matter .",
    "the numerical analysis is based on a nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) type model , allowing a consistent determination of the density and temperature dependence of quark masses , pairing gaps and chemical potentials under neutron star constraints .",
    "the resulting phase diagram suggests that three - flavor phases of the cfl - type occur only at rather high densities @xcite and render hybrid star configurations gravitationally unstable @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to large pairing gaps in cfl quark matter , the r - mode instabilities can not be damped @xcite and cooling is inhibited @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will focus on two - flavor color superconducting phases in compact stars , the 2sc+x phase @xcite , for which a detailed investigation of the cooling phenomenology for hybrid stars has already been worked out @xcite , and the iso - csl phase @xcite for which a consistent microscopic calculation of the direct urca emissivity and the bulk viscosity will be presented here for the first time @xcite .",
    "this will form the basis of further phenomenological applications in cs physics .",
    "single - flavor spin - one pairing channels have been investigated before , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "we consider the iso - csl phase @xcite for which in the pairing gap matrix @xmath0 the three antisymmetric color matrices @xmath1 are locked to the three spin matrices ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the two flavor channels are decoupled and the thermodynamical potential is therefore @xmath3 where the contribution of a single flavor in mean field approximation is given by @xmath4,\\ ] ] the most important feature of the energy spectrum is that the dispersion relations of all modes @xmath5 have nonvanishing gaps and the lowest excitation energy is of @xmath6(1 mev ) , as required from cooling phenomenology . without a microscopic basis ,",
    "such a mode spectrum has been postulated within the 2sc+x phase @xcite . in the following",
    "we compare results for direct urca neutrino emissivities and bulk viscosities of these two phases , using the parameter set for constituent quark mass @xmath7 mev from ref .",
    "@xcite .      following iwamotos seminal paper @xcite where the direct urca emissivity of quark matter , @xmath8 has first been derived",
    ", there have been a number of calculations , in particular for color superconducting phases . from the most recent ones beyond the exponential suppression ansatz",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "however , none of these is useable for cooling simulations because they have either ungapped modes which result in too fast cooling or the pairing pattern is not microscopically founded .",
    "nevertheless , in deriving the neutrino emissivities for the 2sc+x and the iso - csl phase we follow the strategy of these refs . with the result @xmath9 where we introduced the function @xmath10   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath11 characterising the influence of the superconducting gaps on the corresponding emissivity .",
    "for the iso - csl phase , the coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 are defined in ref . @xcite and the gaps , obtained from the minimization of ( [ omega ] ) fulfill in general @xmath15 . in the 2sc+x phase @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "the density dependent x - gap @xmath20 was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for the first time to appropriately fit the cooling data of cs .",
    "here we use the parametrization denoted as model iv in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath20 has been investigated more detailed to fulfill constraints from recent cooling phenomenology .",
    "the influence of the temperature dependence is taken into account by @xmath21 where one can find values for @xmath22 between 1 - 3.2 in the literature . in the following calculations",
    "we have used @xmath23 .",

    "transport properties in dense quark matter depend sensitively on the color superconductivity pairing patterns and provide thus a tool for unmasking the cs interiors by their cooling and rotational evolution characteristics . on the example of neutrino emissivities and bulk viscosities for the",
    "2sc+x and the iso - csl phase we have demonstrated that both two - flavor color superconducting phases fulfill constraints from the cs phenomenology . for the 2sc+x phase with yet heuristic assumptions for the x - gap the hybrid star configurations and their cooling evolution have been numerically evaluated in accordance with observational data .",
    "the temperature and density behavior of the neutrino emissivity in the microscopically well - founded iso - csl phase appear rather similar so that we expect a good agreement with cs cooling data too .",
    "the bulk viscosities for both phases have been presented here for the first time and provide sufficient damping of r - mode instabilities to comply with the phenomenology of rapidly spinning cs .",
    "we conclude that the subtle interplay between suppression of the direct urca cooling process on the one hand and sufficiently large bulk viscosity puts severe constraints on microscopic approaches to quark matter in compact stars .",
