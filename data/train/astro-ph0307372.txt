    "a microlensing event occurs when a lensing object approaches very close to the line of sight toward the background source star . due to lensing , the lensed star appears to be split into two images .",
    "the locations and magnifications of the individual images are @xmath0\\theta_{\\rm e},\\ ] ] and @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the projected lens - source separation vector normalized by the einstein ring radius @xmath3 .",
    "the einstein ring represents the effective lensing region around the lens within which the source star flux is magnified greater than @xmath4 . for a typical galactic microlensing event , the einstein ring radius is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the lens mass and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the distances to the lens and source star , respectively . for a rectilinear lens - source relative motion ,",
    "the separation vector is related to the lensing parameters by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the time required for the source to transit @xmath3 ( einstein time scale ) , @xmath11 is the closest lens - source separation normalized by @xmath3 ( impact parameter ) , @xmath12 is the time at that moment , and the unit vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 are parallel with and perpendicular to the direction of the relative lens - source motion , respectively .",
    "the image with the higher magnification @xmath15 ( major image ) is located outside of the einstein ring , while the other image with the lower magnification @xmath16 ( minor image ) is located inside of the einstein ring .",
    "the separation between the two images , @xmath17 , for a typical galactic event is very small and thus they can not be resolved .",
    "however , a lensing event can be identified from its characteristic smooth and symmetric light curve @xcite , which is represented by @xmath18 for a more detailed description about microlensing , see @xcite .",
    "if a lensing event is caused by a star having a planet and the planet happens to locate close to the path of one of the two images produced by the primary star , the planet perturbs the nearby image and the event can exhibit noticeable deviations from the light curve of a single lens event @xcite . it is empirically known that if the planet perturbs the major image , the resulting deviation in the lensing light curve becomes positive , while the deviation becomes negative if the planet perturbs the minor image @xcite .    for a planet with a mass ratio to the primary star of @xmath19 , the planetary signal endures for a short period of time of @xmath20 , corresponding to several days for a jupiter - mass planet ( with @xmath21 ) and a few hours for an earth - mass planet ( with @xmath22 ) . however , the strength of the signal depends weakly on @xmath19 .",
    "then , planets can be detected if lensing events are monitored with a high enough frequency .",
    "this frequency can be achieved from the combination of the early warning system to issue alerts of ongoing events in the early stage of lensing magnification and the follow - up observation program to intensively monitor the alerted events .",
    "alert systems were and are being operated by the macho @xcite , eros @xcite , moa @xcite and ogle @xcite groups .",
    "the previously operated and currently operating follow - up collaborations include gman @xcite , mps @xcite , planet @xcite , and microfun ( d.  depoy , private communication ) .    as an additional channel to detect and characterize extrasolar planets via microlensing , @xcite proposed astrometric follow - up observations of lensing events by using next generation high precision interferometers , such as those to be mounted on space - based platform , e.g.  the _ space interferometry mission _ ( sim ) , and those to be mounted on very large ground - based telescopes , e.g.  keck and vlt . when an event is observed by using these instruments , although resolving the individual images is still difficult , it is possible to measure the center - of - light motion of the lensed source star image caused by the change of the separation between the lens and source and the resulting variation of the brightness ratio between the two images . for a single lens event ,",
    "the shift of the image centroid with respect to the unlensed position of the source star ( centroid shift ) is represented by @xmath23 the trajectory of the centroid motion ( astrometric curve ) traces out an ellipse during the event @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that planets can be identified from the perturbations in astrometric curves , which are analogous to photometric perturbations in lensing light curves .",
    "they pointed out that due to the strong correlation between the photometric and astrometric planetary signals , adding astrometric information to the photometric lensing light curve will greatly help in determining the mass ratio and the projected separation of the planet .",
    "in addition , since astrometric lensing observations enable one to determine the absolute mass of the lens system by measuring both the lens proper motion and parallax @xcite , one can determine the absolute mass of the planet .",
    "@xcite further investigated the patterns of astrometric deviations caused by planets with various separations and mass ratios . from this investigation",
    ", they found an interesting tendency of astrometric planetary signals , where while photometric deviations can become either positive or negative depending on which of the two images produced by the primary is perturbed by the planet , astrometric deviations are positive in all tested events regardless of which image is perturbed .",
    "the usefulness of this tendency was soon noticed by @xcite , who pointed out that the problematic photometric degeneracy between binary source and planetary perturbations @xcite can be unambiguously resolved with the additional astrometric information because the astrometric perturbations induced by a faint binary source companion are always negative , which is opposite to the sign of the planet - induced perturbations . however , none of previous works explained the reason for the known tendencies of photometric and astrometric planetary signals . in this paper , we analytically show why planet - induced astrometric signals are _ always _ positive while photometric signals can be either positive or negative .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in   2 , we describe the basics of planetary microlensing . in   3 , we derive the relation between photometric and astrometric planetary signals and explain the reasons for the empirically known properties of the signs of planetary signals .",
    "we summarize and conclude in   4 .",
    "the planetary lensing behavior is described by the formalism of binary lensing with a very low mass - ratio companion .",
    "if a source star located at @xmath24 in complex notations is lensed by two point - mass lenses with the individual locations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 and the mass fractions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , the locations of the resulting images @xmath29 are obtained by solving the lens equation , which is represented by @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath32 and all lengths are normalized by the combined einstein ring radius . since the lens equation describes a mapping from the lens plane to the source plane , finding image positions ( @xmath33 ) for a given source position ( @xmath34 ) requires inverting the lens equation .",
    "although the lens equation for a binary lens system can not be algebraically inverted due to its nonlinearity , it can be expressed as a fifth - order polynomial in @xmath32 , and thus the image positions can be obtained by numerically solving the polynomial equation @xcite . since the lensing process conserves the source star surface brightness , the magnification of each image equals to the area ratio between the image and the unlensed source and mathematically it is given by the jacobian of the mapping equation evaluated at the image position ; @xmath35 then , the total magnification is the sum of the magnifications of the individual images , i.e.  @xmath36 .",
    "since the position of the image centroid equals to the magnification - weighted mean position of the individual images , the centroid shift is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath2 are the vector notations of each image position and the location of the unlensed source position , respectively .",
    "due to the very small mass ratio of the planet to the primary , the planetary lensing behavior is well described by that of a single lens for most of the event duration .",
    "however , noticeable deviations can occur when the source passes the region close to caustics .",
    "the caustics are the main new features of binary lensing and refer to the set of source positions at which the magnification of a point source becomes infinity . for a planetary case ,",
    "the caustics are located along or very close to the primary - planet axis ( @xmath39 axis ) and its location on the @xmath39 axis is approximated by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the position of the planet @xcite .",
    "caustics are located within the einstein ring when the planetary separation is in the range of @xmath42 . since the size of the caustic , which is directly proportional to the planet detection efficiency ,",
    "is maximized when the planet is in this range , this range is referred as the ` lensing zone ' @xcite .",
    "the location of the caustic in the _ source _ plane corresponds to the region near the one of the two images created by the primary in the _ lens _ ( or _ image _ ) plane . from the lens plane point of view , therefore , noticeable deviation occurs when the planet is located close to one of the two images produced by the primary .",
    "major image perturbation refers to the case where the deviation is caused by a planet located near the major image .",
    "since the major image is located outside of the einstein ring , major image perturbations are caused by planets with separations greater than @xmath3 , i.e.  @xmath43 ( wide planet ) . in this case , one finds from equation ( 10 ) that @xmath44 and @xmath45 , implying that the caustic is located on the same side of the planet with respect to the center of mass between the primary and planet .",
    "minor image perturbation , on the other hand , refers to the case where the planet perturbs the minor image .",
    "the minor image is located inside of the einstein ring , and thus minor image perturbations are caused by planets with separations less than @xmath3 , i.e.  @xmath46 ( close planet ) .",
    "unlike the single caustic formed by the wide planet , the close planet causes formation of two caustics , which are located symmetrically with respect to the primary - planet axis , i.e. @xmath39 axis . for planets in the lensing zone ,",
    "however , the caustics are located very close to the @xmath39 axis , and thus their locations can also be approximated by eq .",
    "( 10 ) . since @xmath47",
    ", the caustics are located on the opposite side of the planet with respect to the center of mass .",
    "in this section , we analytically derive the relation between photometric and astrometric microlensing signals of planets and explain the reason for the empirically known properties of the signs of the signals .",
    "we begin with the case where the major image is perturbed by a planet .",
    "let us define @xmath48 as the fractional photometric deviation , i.e. @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the magnifications with and without the perturbation , respectively .",
    "since the minor image is not perturbed by the planet ( see appendix ) , the perturbed magnification is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 represents the magnification of the perturbed major image .",
    "then , the magnification excess can be written as @xmath54 by inverting eq .",
    "( 12 ) , the perturbed major image magnification is expressed in terms of @xmath48 by @xmath55    the location of the perturbed image centroid is represented by @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the positions of the unperturbed major and minor images , respectively .",
    "here we use an approximation that the change in the position of the major image due to the planetary perturbation is small . ] where @xmath39 is the location of the image , @xmath41 is the location of the planet , and @xmath59 is the primary - source separation [ see equations ( 35 ) and ( 36 ) of @xcite ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the fractional photometric deviation is @xmath60 ( see appendix ) . during the time of maximum perturbation when @xmath61 , therefore , the photometric perturbation dominates over the astrometric perturbation , i.e. @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that the astrometric perturbation to the centroid shift derives largely from the photometric perturbation rather than the astrometric shifts in the positions of the individual images . ] by plugging eq .",
    "( 13 ) into eq .",
    "( 14 ) , the centroid position is expressed in terms of @xmath48 by @xmath63    by definition , the astrometric planetary signal is the difference between the centroid positions with and without the planetary perturbation , i.e. @xmath64 where @xmath65 . from eq .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16 ) , one finds that the relation between the astrometric and photometric perturbations in the case of the major image perturbation is @xmath66 one finds a similar relation in the case of the minor image perturbation ; @xmath67    if we define the signs of astrometric shifts such that the direction toward the major image from the lens position is positive , the sign of the term @xmath68 is also positive .",
    "magnification is always positive by definition , and thus the signs of both terms @xmath69 and @xmath70 are also positive .",
    "then , one finds the relation between the signs of photometric and astrometric perturbations in the case of the major image perturbation ; @xmath71 in the case of the minor image perturbation , the relation is @xmath72 as shown in appendix , the flux of the major image is magnified ( @xmath73 ) when it is perturbed by the planet , while the flux of the minor image is demagnified ( @xmath74 ) due to planetary perturbations .",
    "then , the sign of the astrometric perturbation is positive in both cases of major and minor image perturbations . _",
    "therefore , while the sign of the photometric planetary signal is either positive or negative depending on whether the major or minor is perturbed , astrometric signals are always positive regardless of the type of image perturbations_.    in figure 1 , we present the geometry of an example planetary lens system where the major image is perturbed by a planet . in the figure ,",
    "the coordinates are centered at the center of mass of the lens system and the positions of the primary and the planet are marked by ` x ' .",
    "the diamond - shaped figure represents the caustic and the big dashed circle is the combined einstein ring . the straight line with an arrow represents the source trajectory and the solid and dotted curves running almost in parallel with the source trajectory are the trajectories of the image centroid ( with respect to the lens positions ) with and without the planet - induced perturbation , respectively .",
    "also marked are the location of the source ( the small solid circle on the source trajectory ) at the moment of the image perturbation and the images ( elongated figures at around @xmath75 and 0.7 ) corresponding to the source position .",
    "the blowup of the region around the major image is shown in the inset , where the perturbed and unperturbed images are drawn by solid and dotted lines , respectively . from the comparison of the sizes of the unperturbed and perturbed images ,",
    "one finds that the major image is _ magnified _ due to the perturbation .",
    "photometrically , this causes positive deviations in the lensing light curve ( lower right panel ) .",
    "astrometrically , due to the magnified flux of the major image , the image centroid is additionally shifted further away from the unlensed source position towards the major image , causing also positive deviations in the astrometric curve ( lower left panel ) .",
    "figure 2 shows several more examples of perturbed and unperturbed images to illustrate the mentioned trend of image perturbation applies to general cases of perturbations .    in figure 3 , we present the geometry of an example planetary lens system where the minor image is perturbed by a planet . from the comparison of the unperturbed and perturbed minor images ,",
    "one finds that the perturbed image is _ demagnified _ , in contrast with the magnified major image due to the planetary perturbation .",
    "astrometrically , demagnification of the minor image causes the image centroid to be further shifted towards the major image , resulting in positive deviations , whose sign is same as that of the astrometric deviations caused by the major image perturbation .",
    "we investigated the properties of planetary signals in microlensing light curves and centroid shift trajectories .",
    "we derived analytic relation between the photometric and astrometric planetary signals and explained the reason for the empirically known properties of planetary signals , where the photometric signal can be either positive or negative depending on which of the two images produced by the primary is perturbed , while the astrometric signal is always positive regardless of which image is perturbed .",
    "we thank b.  s.  gaudi and v.  bozza for making very helpful comments on planetary microlensing properties .",

    "kc was supported by korea astronomy society ( kao ) .      by treating the planet - induced deviation as a perturbation",
    ", @xcite derived the expression for microlensing magnification of a lens with a planet by expanding the jacobian of the lens equation to the first order in @xmath19 [ see eq .",

    "the perturbation becomes maximum when the source crosses @xmath39 axis . at this moment , the images are also located along or very close to @xmath39 axis .",

    "the fractional astrometric perturbation is @xmath86 @xcite . then during the time of maximum perturbation when @xmath87 , the second type perturbation dominates and the magnification excess is approximated by @xmath88 from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , one finds that the planet s approach close to one image ( located at @xmath89 ) causes little perturbation on the other image ( located at @xmath90 ) because @xmath91 , implying that only one image is perturbed by the planet .",
    "in addition , since both @xmath19 and the term @xmath92 are positive , the sign of the photometric perturbation is determined by the remaining term @xmath93 . because the major image is located outside of the einstein ring ( @xmath94 ) , and vice versa in the case of the minor image perturbation",
    ", one finds that @xmath95 therefore , the flux of the major image is magnified when it is perturbed by the planet , while the flux of the minor image is demagnified due to planetary perturbations , i.e. @xmath96"
