    "the cosmological observations indicate that our universe have not only experienced the large amount of accelerating expansion in its infancy but it is still undergoing a small rate of accelerating expansion  @xcite .",
    "the present cosmological data also indicates that more than 70% of the total energy density is attributed to a component of dark energy density  @xcite .",
    "the source of driving force to the present accelerating expansion is thought to be dark energy .",
    "although the physical origin of dark energy is still unknown , many cosmological candidates such as the cosmological constant or several kinds exotic matter like phantom fields  @xcite , quintessence  @xcite , or modifications of gravitational theory have been proposed .",
    "if we define the ratio of the pressure of the universe @xmath6 to its energy density @xmath7 as @xmath8 , then the cosmological constant is characterized by @xmath9 and the phantom field is characterized by @xmath10 . if the cosmological constant",
    "is identified as dark energy , @xmath11 is a constant . on the other hand , @xmath11 varies with time if we adopt the assumptions of exotic matter .",
    "although the simplest candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath12 , there is a well known fine tuning problem between the energy density of cosmological constant @xmath13 and the radiation density @xmath14 : the ratio of @xmath13 and @xmath14 depends on the energy scale and @xmath15 at the planck scale , on the other hand @xmath16 at the electroweak scale because @xmath17 is a constant .",
    "however the effective equation of state parameter is not necessarily a constant .",
    "alternative ways for dark energy model in which either dark energy or its effective equation of state parameter is a function of time .",
    "the cosmological data indicates that the time varying dark energy model is a better fitting than a cosmological constant : the effective equation of state parameter of dark energy @xmath18 at @xmath19 and it changes from @xmath2 to @xmath3 at @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "it indicates that @xmath0 behaves as phantom - like at lower redshifts @xmath20 and dust - like at higher redshifts .",
    "since a phantom component with @xmath3 violates energy conditions , one may hope to make a dark energy model with the above nature in the framework of effective features , not caused by a phantom field .",
    "then we may hope to do this behavior in the framework of braneworld scenario .    in the braneworld scenario ,",
    "our universe is realized as a three dimensional hypersurface ( brane ) which is embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime ( bulk ) .",
    "gravity can propagate to the entire spacetime while the ordinary matter is confined on the brane .",
    "it received much attentions due to the possibilities that the compactification with the large extra dimensions  @xcite , the solution to the large disparity between the electroweak scale and the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "it is an important question that whether the standard four dimensional gravity is reproduced in these scenario .",
    "it is showed that the massless gravitons are trapped on the brane and the four dimensional gravity is reproduced  @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting question that how the present accelerating expansion of our universe can be treated in the framework of the braneworld scenario .",
    "the evolution of our universe is described as an effective friedmann equation on a brane .",
    "it is modified from the usual friedmann equation because of the presence of the fifth dimension  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the fifth dimension allows a five - dimensional bulk matter which propagates in the fifth dimension . it may interact with the ordinary matter on the brane and it could be able to lead the behavior that resembles to dark energy . in this picture , the bulk pressure and the off - diagonal terms in the energy - momentum tensor affect the cosmological evolution of the brane",
    "it has been shown that @xmath0 crosses @xmath5 at lower redshift in the model which allows the energy exchange between the four dimensional universe and the fifth dimension  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the general framework of the five - dimensional theory",
    ". then we present the effective friedmann equation and the conservation of energy - momentum based on @xcite . in section 3 , we derive the hubble equation on the 3-brane .",
    "it is quite different from that of a standard four dimensional friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology in several points .",
    "then we derive the effective equation of state parameter @xmath0 of dark energy . in section 4",
    ", we examine the evolutions of @xmath0 and investigate under which condition it exhibits crossing of @xmath5 at @xmath4 and @xmath18 at @xmath19 in two cases : ( i ) there is energy exchange between the four dimensional universe and the fifth dimension , and ( ii ) there is no energy exchange between the four dimensional universe and the fifth dimension .",
    "we also examine the evolutions of deceleration parameter and energy density components .",
    "section 5 is devoted to summary .",
    "we consider the five - dimensional action of the following form , @xmath21 + \\int d^{5}x\\,\\sqrt{-g_{b } } \\left(-t_{b}+\\mathcal{l}_{b}^{(m ) } \\right)\\delta(y ) .",

    "we generally allow the anisotropic choice of the bulk pressure : @xmath56 .",
    "the dynamics of the five - dimensional universe is governed by the five - dimensional einstein equations .",

    "we have to take into account of the junction conditions  @xcite when we solve the einstein equations on the brane .",
    "because the first derivatives of the metric with respect to @xmath22 can be discontinuous at @xmath24 while the metric is required to be continuous across the brane , the delta functions appear in the second derivatives of the metric .",
    "we define the jump factor @xmath62 and the mean value @xmath63 of a function @xmath64 by the following equations , @xmath65    we obtain the junction conditions as follows , @xmath66    taking into account the @xmath25 symmetry around @xmath24 , we obtain @xmath67    taking the jump of ( [ eq : eeb4 ] ) , we also obtain a relation between mean values @xmath68 and @xmath69 ,    @xmath70    substituting ( [ eq : ec8 ] ) and ( [ eq : ec9 ] ) in ( [ eq : eeb4 ] ) , we obtain the effective friedmann equation in the limit @xmath71 , @xmath72    in the above expression , we used the equation of state for the brane : @xmath73 .",
