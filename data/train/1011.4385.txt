    "transiting extrasolar planets present an opportunity to study the properties of planetary atmospheres using transmission spectroscopy .",
    "the atmosphere regulates heat transfer around the planet , and determines what fraction of the incoming flux from the star is absorbed @xcite .",
    "this can have a dramatic effect on the structure and evolution of a hot jupiter ; e.g. additional heating can cause the planet to expand , increasing the strength of the tidal interaction with its star .",
    "this may result in the planet s destruction as it spirals into its host star @xcite .",
    "when light from a star passes through the atmosphere of a transiting planet , some wavelengths are absorbed much more strongly than others , so the apparent radius of the planet is larger at these wavelengths .",
    "the base of the atmosphere of a jupiter - like planet is generally defined as the atmospheric depth at which the slant optical depth is equal to 2/3 @xcite . at the typical temperature of a hot jupiter , strong absorption",
    "is predicted in the sodium doublet line at wavelengths 5889.95 and 5895.92 @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the area of a hot jupiter s atmosphere to the disc of its star is typically @xmath1 , so during transit the depth of the sodium absorption lines relative to the continuum are expected to increase by this amount .",
    "@xcite used the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ to obtain the first detection of increased sodium absorption during transit of @xmath2 per cent at bandwidth 12 for the exoplanet hd209458b . @xcite",
    "re - analysed these data and found a signal of 0.11 per cent at bandwidth 4.4 .",
    "@xcite made ground - based observations of the same planet , but found no significant sodium absorption .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter s08 ) improved on this analysis , finding absorption of 0.135 per cent at 1.5 ; and @xcite detected sodium absorption of 0.067 per cent at bandwidth 12 in the atmosphere of hd189733b , also using ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "the sodium transit depths for hd209458b are around 3 times smaller than predicted by models with a cloudless atmosphere and solar sodium abundance @xcite , which shows that atomic sodium is depleted by some mechanism .",
    "possible explanations include photoionization , condensation , or the presence of high clouds or haze in the atmosphere .",
    "other atmospheric chemicals have been detected in exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "@xcite used transmission spectroscopy with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope ( spitzer ) _ to detect the absorption signature of water in the atmosphere of hd189733b .",
    "@xcite used nicmos on the _ hst _ to detect methane and water in the atmosphere of the same planet .",
    "_ spitzer _ has also been used extensively for occultation spectroscopy  the spectrum of the day - side of the planet can be obtained from the difference between the in - eclipse and out - of - eclipse spectra . while transmission spectroscopy probes the limb of the planet , occultation spectroscopy probes the day - side of the planet , and",
    "when these observations are at infrared wavelengths , temperature information can be obtained .",
    "wasp-17b @xcite , a hot jupiter in scorpius , is the least dense planet currently known , and is in a 3.74-d orbit around the star wasp-17 , which has a _",
    "v _ mag of 11.6 .",
    "wasp-17b is 0.05au from its f6-type host star , so is a pm class exoplanet @xcite whose atmosphere is expected to have a thermal inversion layer .",
    "anderson et al .",
    "( in preparation ) finds , from an analysis of new data from _",
    ", that the new parameters of the planet are 2.00@xmath3 and 0.49@xmath4 .",
    "the planet has very low gravity , and the scale height of its atmosphere is approximately 5 times larger than hd209458b , so the sodium transit signal is expected to be correspondingly larger .",
    "however , if the atmosphere of wasp-17b is not sodium - depleted like hd209458b , the signal could be much larger .",
    "similar observations are needed for many more hot jupiters to improve models of their atmospheres .",
    "we present here the first ground - based transmission spectroscopy of wasp-17b using the giraffe spectrograph on the very large telescope ( vlt ) in chile .",
    "our aim is to measure sodium absorption in and out - of - transit , and to detect any additional sodium absorption by the atmosphere of wasp-17b during the transit .",
    "we used the integral field unit - mode ( ifu - mode ) of flames , which has the highest throughput of all the available instruments , allowing maximum collection of photons during the observations .",
    "the ifu - mode also allows simultaneous observation of a comparison star and sky background , without having to move the telescope .",
    "details of the observations are given in section  [ sec : obs ] , analysis is described in section  [ sec : ana ] , the discussion is given in section  [ sec : dis ] , and section  [ sec : con ] concludes .",
    "we obtained 24 spectra of the wasp-17 system , eight during transit , using the 8-m vlt in paranal , chile .",
    "we used the giraffe , fibre - fed spectrograph and the ifu - mode of flames , mounted on kueyen ( ut2 ) , to put ifus on the the target star , a comparison star , and three sky regions .",
    "each ifu is composed of a bundle of 21 fibres ; 22 if the ifu includes a simultaneous calibration ( simcal ) fibre .",
    "observations began at 22:56ut on 2009 june 20 , and ended at 07:59ut on 2009 june 21 .",
    "mid - transit time of wasp-17b on 2009 june 21 was 04:38ut , and the transit duration was 4.4hours @xcite .",
    "start times of each exposure , which observing plate was used , mean airmass for that exposure and orbital phase are given in table  [ tab : ot ] .",
    ".exposure number , start times of target observations ( in ut ) , observing plate used , mean airmass during exposure , and orbital phase ( it  in - transit , oot  out - of - transit , ing ",
    "ingress , and eg  egress ) . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]         the transit depth for an ionized atmosphere predicted by the b01 data for hd209458b is 0.144 per cent at bandwidth 1.5 , slightly higher than that measured by s08 .",
    "however , the predicted transit depths for the two wider bandwidths are almost twice as high as those measured by s08 .",
    "our measurements of wasp-17b show a large transit depth at narrow bandwidths , a shallow transit depth at medium bandwidths , and no significant transit depth at bandwidths 4.0 or wider .",
    "photo - ionization of sodium is expected to reduce the na transit signal ( see b01 ) ; @xcite also modelled the wavelength - dependent transit radius of hd209458b and found that including photo - ionization in the model reduces the transit radius by a third at the wavelength of sodium . however , photo - ionization broadens the sodium absorption profile , which our measurements do not support .",
    "depletion of heavy elements leads to a narrower sodium absorption profile , as the narrow component of the na absorption line is formed at low pressures , high in the atmosphere , and the broad component is formed at high pressures , lower in the atmosphere .",
    "depletion could be caused by the condensation of metals , including sodium , on the cold night - side of the planet .",
    "@xcite hypothesised that half of the limb is depleted in sodium by a factor of 3 , due to condensation on the night - side of the planet , while @xcite showed that the slant optical depth through the atmosphere of a hot jupiter is up to 90 times greater than normal optical depth , and species with a small normal optical depth may mask na absorption features .",
    "it is also possible that the broad na absorption , which originates low in the atmosphere , is being masked by high cloud .",
    "@xcite suggested that silicate and iron clouds high in the atmosphere could be an opacity source for sodium , and @xcite concluded that their measurement of no significant absorption by na or k at 30 bandwidths in the atmosphere of hd189733b was probably due to a haze of sub - micrometre sized particles high in the atmosphere , which masked the absorption signal .",
    "the details of the models used to calculate the effect of dust on alkali absorption line profiles have a large influence on the predicted spectra @xcite , so it is likely that our observations have the potential to test directly models for the formation of dust at atmospheric temperatures and pressures typical for hot jupiters and cool brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that the na depletion in wasp-17b is caused by a combination of the above factors ; sodium is both ionized by the stellar flux , and depleted by condensation on the night - side .",
    "this would explain both the large transit depth at narrow bandwidths , and the lower than predicted transit depth at wider bandwidths .",
    "a layer of opaque cloud high in the atmosphere may explain the sharp cut - off in transit depth between 3 and 4 , or it could be caused by the masking of na absorption features by other species high in the atmosphere .    a transit depth measurement in such a narrow bandwidth is also affected by the rotation of the star . as the planet transits , it blocks the light from different regions of the rotating star .",
    "light coming from parts of the star rotating towards the observer is blue - shifted , and light from parts of the star rotating away from the observer is red - shifted .",
    "this causes a spike in the radial velocity curve due to the orbital motion of the planet  the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .",
    "we are developing a model to account for this .",
    "on the night of 2009 june 20 , we obtained spectra in and out - of - transit of wasp-17b , a hot jupiter in the southern hemisphere with a large atmospheric scale height .",
    "we used the ifu - mode of flames / giraffe on the vlt to simultaneously obtain spectra of an f7-type comparison star and three sky background regions .",
    "we detected additional sodium absorption during the transit of @xmath5 per cent at a measured bandwidth of 0.75 ( 9 @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 per cent at 1.5 ( 4 @xmath6 ) , and @xmath8 per cent at 3.0 ( 5 @xmath6 ) .",
    "we did not detect significant additional sodium absorption at 4.0 , 5.0 , or 6.0 .",
    "our measurements show that wasp-17b , like hd209458b , is depleted in sodium compared to a model with a cloudless atmosphere and solar sodium abundance .",
    "the measured transit depths are best explained by a combination of na ionization by stellar flux , na condensation on the cold night - side , and either a layer of cloud or masking by opaque species high in the atmosphere .",
    "these measurements have provided useful information on the structure of the atmosphere of wasp-17b , which may apply to other hot jupiters .",
    "the changes of observing plate during the night were a major source of systematic errors , and in future observations , only one plate should be used .",
    "this is acceptable if no comparison star is observed , as there is no need to move the ifus around to account for differential refraction over the field of view .",
    "we conclude that the ifu mode of flames on the vlt is a very effective tool for obtaining transmission spectroscopy of extrasolar planets .",
