    "the calculation of electronic and vibronic transition matrix elements between electronic states of the same or different spin and/or spatial symmetry is a ubiquitous task in the modeling of photochemical and photophysical processes .",
    "prime examples include the modeling of non - adiabatic dynamics processes @xcite as well as light - induced excited spin - state trapping phenomena @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of these processes builds upon the calculation of intersystem crossing rates @xcite which , besides electronic and vibronic coupling elements , requires the evaluation of spin - orbit ( so ) coupling ( soc ) matrix elements .",
    "similarly , calculating magnetic properties @xcite such as molecular g - factors and electron - nucleus hyperfine coupling , which are central parameters in electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) spectroscopy , requires spin - orbit coupled wave functions @xcite . to this end ,",
    "correlated two- and four - component _ ab initio _ wave function @xcite , and density functional theory approaches @xcite . in the present study we focus on",
    "epr g - tensors for testing purposes , but it should be noted that the underlying novel method of gaining access to wave functions that include the effects from soc has a vast range of applications .    while it is possible to treat soc variationally , a considerable number of two - step correlated wave function approaches for the calculation of molecular g - factors were developed over the past decades ( see , for example , refs .  and literature citations in these works and in refs .  ) . in these schemes ,",
    "the calculation of a number of non- or scalar - relativistic many - particle spin - free states that are eigenfunctions of the spin - squared operator @xmath0 , is decoupled from a subsequent perturbative or variational mixing of the latter through the so coupling operator to obtain so coupled many - electron wave functions ( e.g. by diagonalization `` state - interaction '' ) .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate properties such as g - factors in the basis of the eigenstates of the so operator subsequently .",
    "appealing features of the two - step approaches are that valuable insight into contributions of each ( ground or excited ) spin - state to the g - tensor is gained , and that the underlying wave function basis is spin - adapted . the price to pay",
    "is the need to calculate a sufficient number of spin - free states to interact , which can amount up to several hundred states to achieve convergence for ( heavy - element containing ) molecules where electron correlation and spin - orbit coupling contributions can be of similar order of magnitude .",
    "open shell electronic structures are often governed by strong electron correlation effects . in this context ,",
    "multiconfigurational methods are the preferred methods of choice @xcite  which typically split electron correlation into a static and a dynamic contribution .",
    "however , such a separation requires careful attention @xcite . a well - established approach to handle static correlation",
    "is the complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) ansatz @xcite which requires to select a tailored number of ( partially occupied ) active orbitals .",
    "the selection of active orbitals is a tedious procedure but can be automatized @xcite . since the computational cost of traditional casscf scales exponentially with",
    "the number of active orbitals and electrons , tractable active orbital spaces are presently limited to about 18 electrons in 18 orbitals @xcite .",
    "these limitations can be overcome by resorting to the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) approach @xcite in quantum chemistry @xcite which , in combination with a self - consistent - field orbital optimization ansatz ( dmrg - scf ) @xcite , is capable of approximating casscf wave functions to chemical accuracy with merely a polynomial scaling .",
    "dmrg - scf therefore allows to handle much larger active orbital spaces that can boldly surpass the casscf limit . to account in addition for spin - orbit coupling in a dmrg framework , variational so approaches @xcite  as well as two - step approaches @xcite  based on spin - free dmrg wave functions",
    "have been reported recently . in this work",
    ", we present a generalized state - interaction approach for _ nonorthogonal _ spin - free matrix product state ( mps ) wave functions which enables the evaluation of arbitrary one- and two - particle transition matrix elements as well as so coupling matrix elements .",
    "diagonalization of the so hamiltonian matrix , for instance , yields spin - orbit coupled wave functions as linear combinations of the uncoupled , spin - pure mps states . the latter can ( but do not have to ) be obtained as results from one or several dmrg - scf orbital optimization calculations .",
    "this allows for utmost flexibility in the individual dmrg - scf steps as each state - specific or spin - specific state - averaged orbital optimization is given the possibility to reflect potential relative differences in open - shell occupancies .",
    "for example , transition metal as well as lanthanide and actinide complexes often exhibit different @xmath1-  and @xmath2-occupations ( transition metals ) and @xmath1- , @xmath2-  and @xmath3-occupations ( lanthanides / actinides ) in ground- and electronically excited electronic states of various spin symmetries .",
    "however , a set of wave functions that were optimized individually generally implies mutual nonorthogonality of the respective mo bases .",
    "moreover , the mo bases may neither be orthogonal to each other nor non - interacting which can , e.g. , strongly affect the calculation of transition moments between such electronic states @xcite . as first shown in a landmark paper by malmqvist @xcite , an elegant approach for the calculation of matrix elements and transition density matrices",
    "is the transformation to a biorthonormal basis for the bra and ket orbital basis of the respective wave functions .",
    "a change of the mo basis to a biorthonormal orbital basis necessitates , however , not only to transform all one- and two - electron integrals but to also `` counter - rotate '' the configuration basis of the wave function . for configuration - interaction ( ci)-type expansions ,",
    "the rotations and counter - rotations can be achieved by a sequence of single - orbital transformations @xcite  that require only one - electron operations .",
    "subsequently , standard second - quantization algebra can be exploited for the evaluation of overlap matrix elements as well as arbitray one- and two - particle matrix elements between the states in the biorthonormal basis . in a recent work ,",
    "olsen @xcite   exploited the potential of the biorthonormal approach further to devise an efficient algorithm for ci and orbital optimization schemes based on nonorthogonal orbitals . in contrast to previous nonorthogonal ci approaches ( cf",
    ".  ref .  )",
    ", this newly proposed algorithm @xcite  requires only the calculation of one- and two - particle reduced density matrices .    in this paper",

    "the work of malmqvist @xcite , the central element of our algorithm is the transformation of the bra and ket mps wave functions to a biorthonormal basis representation .",
