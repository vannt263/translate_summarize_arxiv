    "the metallicities at these high redshifts are down by approximately the same factor , @xmath118 .",
    "an accurate analytical model for the redshift dependence of @xmath115 and @xmath119 is difficult to construct due to the essential role played by star formation .",
    "nevertheless , this dependence should be included since it is a crucial ingredient in our analysis of molecule formation with cosmic epoch . in our numerical work",
    ", the metallicity is calculated from the star formation rate in the closed box limit and also in the limit of the ratio of stars to gas being small i.e. @xmath120 .",
    "consequently we can write @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the yield of metals like c and o ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "the production of dust follows by assuming that a fraction , @xmath123 , of metals is instantly locked up into grains ( typically silicate cores ) .",
    "therefore , we find that the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath124 is given by @xmath125 as we shall show later , the critical metallicities in our analysis turn out to be @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , we have neglected the significantly lower initial metallicity that may have come from the formation of the halo .",
    "the pressure , @xmath127 , in the mid - plane of the proto - galactic disk can be estimated by assuming that the mass in the disk is in the gas phase and using the archimedean formula @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the gravitational acceleration normal to the disk . for a thin disk @xmath129",
    "is given by @xmath130 where @xmath131 is newton s constant and @xmath132 is the surface density of matter in the disk .",
    "therefore , one can write @xmath133 which can be written using equation ( 1 ) as @xmath134 with numerical value @xmath135 where @xmath136 , and @xmath137 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the @xmath138 dependence of the pressure is slightly misleading due to the essential role played by @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , due to the maximum in the redshift dependence of the latter , the sizes of protogalactic disks are smaller at redshifts @xmath139 compared to @xmath140 .",
    "note also that at redshift @xmath141 , the pressure calculated from the weight of the gas is an order of magnitude greater than the thermal pressure calculated from taking @xmath142 .",
    "in fact , if one takes the radial dependence of the column density distribution into account and averages over only the inner 3 kpc of the disk , then the gravitational pressure is two orders of magnitude larger than the thermal pressure .",
    "this is also the case in our galaxy and consequently there must be some turbulent pressure that holds up the gas ( boulares & cox 1990 , norman & ferrara 1996 ) .",
    "the turbulent pressure is due to kinetic motions from supernovae and superbubbles ultimately due to massive star formation . for low star formation rates",
    "the turbulent pressure may not be effective and the mid - plane pressure acting on the thermal component may increase leading to a density increase of more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this needs to be kept in mind when discussing the phase diagrams describing the state of the protogalactic gas .",
    "the pressure , @xmath143 , in a virialized halo with a gas fraction @xmath144 is given by @xmath145 we therefore neglect the halo pressure relative to the disk pressure .",
    "more detailed models require the consideration of the pressures and density profiles in the halo and the role of cooling flows to precipitate material from halo to disk .",
    "these complex issues will not be addressed further here ( c.f .",
    "norman and meiksin 1996 )    the radiation pressure is given by @xmath146 and we verify that it is always less than the gas pressure in the proto - disks for each of our calculations .",
    "we define the ionization parameter used here by @xmath147 with @xmath148 the total number density , and a numerical value defined by @xmath149 .",
    "the dependence of the pressures and the ionization parameter are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the radiation pressure is typically much less than the gas pressure for the epochs studied here , but is of the same order of magnitude for @xmath150 .",
    "the ionization parameter varies by a factor of five over the @xmath151 range , because of the turn - over in the quasar population around @xmath152 .",
    "we now turn to examine the epoch when molecular hydrogen is produced in the gas phase .",
    "we first use a simple model ( donahue & shull 1991 ) to find the approximate analytical expressions for the molecular hydrogen abundance through the gas phase @xmath153 route .",
    "@xmath154 where @xmath155 is the electron abundance and is given by @xmath156 these equations assume that the h@xmath157 abundance is in equilibrium and its dominant destruction channel is the reaction with neutral hydrogen yielding h@xmath3 .",
    "conversely , the dominant destruction channels of molecular hydrogen are uv photodissociation and collisional dissociation at temperatures @xmath158 k. a simple model for the ionization heating yields @xmath159 and the molecular hydrogen abundance is given by @xmath160 for our two component model , where the radiation field is split into a component longward of 912  and one shortward of the lyman limit , we find the temperature to be @xmath161 and the molecular hydrogen abundance to be equal to @xmath162 in the numerical work , the optically thin h@xmath3 dissociation rate assumed in the above equation has been corrected for the fact that at abundances of the order of 1column densities in excess of @xmath163 @xmath12 , h@xmath3 self - shielding plays a role ( see below ) .",
    "it is generally expected that feedback mechanisms may be important in galaxy formation ( c.f .",
    "norman & ikeuchi 1996 ) .",
    "the following model is considered here .",
    "if the internal star formation generates a dominant radiation field then the gas will be heated to above @xmath2 and the molecules will be collisionally dissociated .",
    "we assume that the absence of molecular hydrogen formation would strongly limit the efficiency of star formation . from the simple model used above we find that for the stellar radiation field the temperature can be estimated to be @xmath164 giving a limiting star formation rate of @xmath165 using the estimate of the density from equation ( 2 ) we find that @xmath166 for a schmidt star formation law where @xmath167 with , @xmath168 , this corresponds to a critical column density @xmath169 for a protogalaxy of a given mass we find that , using the arguments outlined in section 2 , the radius of the disk decreases with redshift as @xmath170 yielding , with @xmath171 , @xmath172 for star formation to proceed at all , @xmath110 should be a factor of a few smaller .      we have analyzed the feedback effects in terms of a fixed , continuous star formation rate .",
    "we now discuss the burst mode where we envisage the following cycle : the star formation rate is sufficiently high , so that all molecules are dissociated ; the star formation turns off ; the molecules reform ; and another burst occurs .    the time scale , @xmath173 , for the dissociation of molecular hydrogen , assuming no self - shielding , is @xmath174 and the timescale , @xmath175 , for the formation of molecular hydrogen is @xmath176 consequently , the duty cycle , @xmath177 , of on - burst to off - burst is@xmath178 since the amplitude of the radiation field is set by the level of star formation rate it follows that in any burst the mass of the stars formed @xmath179 is constant and given by @xmath180 thus , small bursts can occur but with a very low mean effective star formation rate .",
    "it should be emphasized that once a multi - phase medium has been established , bursts can be sustained ( spaans & norman 1996 ) .",
    "we adopt the heating and cooling curves presented by donahue & shull ( 1991 ) .",
    "we include cooling by [ oi ] 63 @xmath65 m , [ cii ] 158 @xmath65 m and rotational transitions of co for temperatures below 3000 k. these terms are only of importance for @xmath181 .",
    "heating due to photo - electric emission from grains is included and contributes for @xmath182 . at every redshift equation ( 9 )",
    "is used to determine the metallicity and expression ( 8) yields the ambient radiation field .",
    "the latter is integrated over the hydrogen ionization and h@xmath3 photo - dissociation cross sections . the ionization , chemical and thermal balance is solved iteratively until convergence is better than 1% in the temperature and h@xmath3 abundance .",
    "the redshift dependence of the baryonic mass fraction is included in the calculation of the column density . in deriving the h@xmath3 abundances",
    "we have included the radial n(hi ) profiles of proto - galactic disks as presented by kauffmann ( 1996 ) .",
    "the results for a fixed star formation rate @xmath183 are presented in figure 4 . between @xmath184 and @xmath185 ,",
    "the gas is kept at a fairly constant temperature of approximately 500 k. this confirms the suggestion by haiman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that h@xmath3 cooling can facilitate the collapse of high - mass objects and initiate the formation of structure in the early universe .",
    "it is also apparent that due to the importance of the stellar radiation field , massive star formation will not occur since a cool phase of @xmath186 k gas is not present above a redshift of two .",
    "in fact , the existence of this moderate epoch ensures that the initial cooling time of the disk is not shorter than the dynamical time at redshifts larger than 3 .",
    "if this would not be so , then the star formation rates at high redshifts would be much too large .",
    "these effects are further reflected in the abundance of co which remains low down to a redshift of unity .",
    "when the metallicity reaches a threshold of approximately @xmath187 , the magnitude of the cooling curve is strongly enhanced .",
    "a multi - phase medium is now expected to result .",
    "note that to simplify equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) for the metal enrichment and dust - to - gas ratio development we have assumed a schmidt law with index , @xmath188 , implying the star formation rate per unit mass , @xmath189 , is a constant .",
    "figure 5 presents phase diagrams for various epochs and star formation rates . for early epochs , h@xmath3 is the only coolant below 3000 k and only single temperature solutions exist for certain pressures .",
    "as the metallicity increases the @xmath190 curve attains its characteristic s - shape and lines of constant pressure cut it at three different temperatures .",
    "that is , a multi - phase medium has formed in which the cool and warm components are stable ( field , goldsmith & habing 1969 ) and which can facilitate large scale star formation .",
    "_ from figure 5 one finds that the transition to a multi - phase ism in the bulk of the galactic disks occurs at @xmath191 .",
    "_ at this point it is timely to mention the recent observations of galaxies in the hubble deep field presented by madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and mobasher et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the star formation history of the universe .",
    "although the published results are preliminary , they seem to suggest evidence for a star formation epoch around @xmath192 .    assuming that there is @xmath193 supernova per @xmath194 of stars formed , the filling factor of the hot gas component due to supernovae is ( mckee & ostriker 1977 ) @xmath195 which can be written using the critical star formation rate rate as @xmath196 for a schmidt star formation law , and using equation ( 1 ) , we find @xmath197 where , @xmath198 , and consequently the estimate is fairly robust .    therefore , for high star formation rates at the critical value ( i.e.  more massive objects ) the filling factor of hot gas can be significant in these protogalactic disks since the pressure is low and the supernova bubbles can expand and fill large volumes .",
    "the above calculation is indicative only since the star formation is usually clumped and the supernova bubbles generally break out of the disk and vent their energy into the halo of the protogalaxy .",
    "this process can also result in a feedback that inhibits star formation ( norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) .",
    "however high star formation rates a multi - phase medium may develop where the hot phase is driven by supernovae energy input . for star formation rates of @xmath199 and below , the hot phase is not significant and a two - phase mode can occur .",
    "an additional important ingredient in the regulation of the star formation is the formation of h@xmath3 on dust grains which renders its abundance independent of the electron fraction .",
    "these effects have been included in the models above , but an analytic model is presented here to facilitate a connection with observations .    in the presence of dust and at low densities , molecular hydrogen is formed through grain surface reactions . in steady state , the local h@xmath3 density is given by ( tielens & hollenbach 1985 , van dishoeck & black 1986 ) @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the total hydrogen density .",
    "we have discussed the mean density in the disk but it is necessary to make a good estimate of the mean density in the diffuse clouds in the cold neutral medium component where the @xmath0 formation is most likely to be initiated . we choose to parameterize the clumpiness of the cold neutral clouds by a diffuse cloud covering factor @xmath202 . if , as we have indicated above , the protostellar disks are not subject to substantial massive star formation before molecules are formed then we do not expect the development of a supernova - driven hot ( @xmath203 ) component .",
    "consequently , the temperature and density contrast between the cloud and intercloud component will be modest .",
    "we infer that the covering factor of the diffuse cloud component is of order @xmath16 .",
    "the controlling parameter , @xmath204 , is the ratio of the formation rate of molecular hydrogen on grains to the photo - dissociation rate of @xmath0.@xmath106 is given by @xmath205 where @xmath206 denotes the enhancement of the average uv background with respect to the interstellar field at @xmath207 , @xmath208 is the optical depth in the uv continuum and @xmath209 , @xmath210 is the unattenuated @xmath0 photodissociation rate and @xmath211 is the self - shielding function .",
    "the rate constant , @xmath212 , depends on the nature of the grains .",
    "the value of @xmath210 depends on the precise slope of the uv background between 912 and 1100  .    for the present discussion ,",
    "we want to determine for which epoch molecular hydrogen self - shields in the cold diffuse clouds created in the phase transition , and therefore adopt the constraint @xmath213 yielding a fractional h@xmath3 abundance of @xmath214 . for self - shielding ,",
    "the constraint ( 37 ) reduces to @xmath215 explicitly including the redshift dependence and the dependence on covering factor we find that @xmath216 subscripts with zero refer to present time values .    for @xmath217",
    "the internally generated radiation field dominates at lower redshifts , @xmath141 . in the limiting case",
    "where @xmath218 , the total extinction varies slowly with redshift since the lower gas - to - dust ratio of the absorber compensates for its higher column density .",
    "in this case , the critical redshift for @xmath0 formation , @xmath219 , is given by @xmath220 with a numerical value @xmath221 .",
    "including variations in the value of @xmath222 , this yields a fiducial range for @xmath0 formation of , @xmath223 .",
    "these estimates have the advantage that they are weakly dependent on the input parameters .",
    "the strongest dependence is on covering factor and star formation rate .",
    "obviously , for small covering factors molecules may form at higher redshift but they will be less observable . note that the epoch of significant dust shielding and cooling are similar since the dust production and metallicity production are closely related .",
    "the increasing dust columns can absorb a significant fraction of the internal stellar radiation field and this will influence the the time scale on which subsequent star formation proceeds . using the formalism of mckee ( 1983 ) it is possible to estimate the effect of the dust column on the star formation rate .",
    "there is a critical extinction of approximate 4 mag , necessary to absorb most of the radiation of newly formed stars .",
    "the time scale to convert all available mass into stars for a density of roughly 1000 @xmath224 is given by @xmath225^{1 - 2.5/a_v}e^{16/a_v}\\qquad { \\rm yr}\\ ] ] and the dust extinction @xmath226 .",
    "for @xmath28 this time scale is much larger than the local hubble time , but for epochs later than 1.7 star formation can proceed efficiently in the bulk of the galaxies .",
    "the covering factor discussed above is ultimately determined by the process of galaxy formation . using the statistical approach discussed in section 2 , for any given redshift , the condition ( 37 ) for h@xmath3 formation on grains can be written as @xmath227 the fraction of galaxies which contain molecules , @xmath228 , is then given by @xmath229 where @xmath230 .",
    "the definition of the statistical epoch of molecule formation is taken to be @xmath231 .",
    "inversion of this condition yields @xmath232 . for the parameter values adopted above and putting the biasing parameter @xmath233 , the relations @xmath234 and @xmath235 approximately hold .",
    "note that @xmath236 does not dependent on biasing , but the value of @xmath232 does .",
    "finally , the probability , @xmath237 , that a given line of sight to a qso will show molecular absorption by an intervening damped lyman alpha cloud in a ( proto-)galaxy is given by ( peebles 1993 ) @xmath238 where the integral extends over redshifts between 0 and @xmath239 and @xmath240 . the characteristic radius ( bright part ) of the galaxy",
    "is chosen equal to @xmath241 kpc . with the parameters given above this",
    "yields @xmath242 .",
    "once the conditions are satisfied for molecular hydrogen formation the time scale is of order @xmath243 .",
    "the ion - chemistry proceeds much faster on a time scale of approximately @xmath244 .",
    "thus , once the hydrogen molecules can be formed on grains , the full range of diffuse cloud species follows immediately .",
    "initially motivated by qso absorption - line observations indicating an absence of molecular hydrogen at high redshift , we have examined the formation of molecular hydrogen , after the epoch of re - ionization , in the context of canonical galaxy formation theory due to hierarchical clustering .",
    "the issue of molecular hydrogen at high redshift has been discussed in recent interesting papers by haiman _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) and tegmark _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) .",
    "whereas they concentrated more on the redshifts above @xmath245 , we are focusing on the physics of the phases of the protogalactic gas at reshifts @xmath246 .",
    "we have been able to use recently computed accurate models for the cosmic background radiation field ( haardt & madau 1996 ) and for the radiation field from a stellar population with a salpeter imf and with a @xmath105 lower - mass cut - off in a continuous star forming mode ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ) .",
    "we have also used a simple model for a protogalactic disk and followed conventional cdm cosmology extended by more recent numerical calculations when considering the spectrum of disk masses and column densities .",
    "we have mainly concentrated on structures associated with 1@xmath6 and 2@xmath6 density fluctuations which are expected to form the bulk of the stars .    as with the recent work by haiman _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) and tegmark _",
    "_  ( 1996 ) we find there is an initial epoch of @xmath0 production in the gas phase produced through the @xmath1 channel route where the abundance of molecular hydrogen is approximately @xmath247 and given simply in terms of the ionization parameter by equations ( 20 ) and ( 22 ) .",
    "predicting the details of the state of the interstellar medium of protogalaxies is a complex task .",
    "we have normalized to what is known from work on the neutral phase of our galaxy and assume that the fundamental units in the gas phase of protogalaxies during this epoch are akin to the diffuse clouds found in our own galaxy .",
    "we have shown that until the metallicity of the gas achieves @xmath32 at a redshift of 1 - 2 , cold giant molecular clouds are not formed due to inefficient cooling .",
    "we have found that star formation in the protogalaxies can become self - regulated due to heating of the gas by the internal stellar radiation field .",
    "we have given a simple analytic model for the feedback process in section 4.1 .",
    "it is possible to define a maximum star formation rate during this epoch .",
    "plausible estimates give a rate of @xmath248 and therefore we have considered an appropriate fiducial star formation rate to be @xmath249 .",
    "the production of metals and dust proceeds slowly in this self - regulated mode .",
    "this slow star formation phase was shown to terminate once the metal abundance increased to a level of approximately @xmath250 . from an analysis of the phase diagrams in figure 5",
    ", we found that species such as c , o and co become sufficiently abundant and can cool the gas below @xmath8 to @xmath251 . at this point",
    "a phase transition can occur in the protogalactic gas .",
    "for the low fiducial star formation rates discussed above , we find this to be a transition to a two - phase medium as described by field , goldsmith & habing ( 1969 ) .",
    "dense molecular clouds can form and the star formation is no longer self - regulated in the manner described above since the uv radiation does not penetrate the dense cores of the clouds .",
    "we expect that rapid , massive star formation ensues and the abundance of metals and dust increase concomitantly .",
    "the dust abundance also becomes sufficiently high to allow molecular hydrogen formation on grain surfaces . with the increased star formation rates ,",
    "the ism will change to one dominated by supernovae energy input ( mckee & ostriker 1977 ) with significant exchange of mass , energy and metallicity from the disk to the halo ( norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) . in a subsequent paper we will investigate in more detail the effects of this phase transition on the evolution of dwarf galaxies and the importance of metal loss driven by supernova explosions",
    ".    our analysis may be of relevance to the g - dwarf problem : the simple model ( pagel 1989 , and references therein ) for chemical enrichment overproduces the number of metal - poor stars ( cowley 1995 ; worthey , dorman & jones 1996 and references therein ) . of the many solutions proposed for the g - dwarf problem ,",
    "the simplest appears to be that by the time a few percent of the gas mass of a galaxy is assembled into stars , the remaining gas reservoir is already enriched in metals and has not yet experienced any star formation .",
    "the moderate phase due to feedback identified in this work , is likely to cause star formation in an inhomogeneous way .",
    "the very nature of the feedback mechanism dictates that star formation in one location strongly suppresses additional star formation in its vicinity .",
    "the subsequent phase transition then causes rapid star formation throughout the mostly unprocessed ism which now has a metallicity close to 10% of solar .    in our analysis",
    "we have assumed a fixed value for the collapse factor @xmath40 . in reality",
    ", the distribution of spin parameters may be quite wide ( warren et al .",
    "1992 ; dubinsky & carlberg 1991 ) .",
    "if we view the disk as being formed from a spherical object sustaining a low h@xmath3 abundance , driven by the extragalactic uv background , then an increase in the collapse factor will increase the total and h@xmath3 column densities quadratically and the local density like @xmath252 .",
    "consequently , more of the stellar radiation can be absorbed locally , preserving the h@xmath3 abundance and suppressing the global heating , and a higher star formation rate can be sustained .",
    "we estimate , although tentatively , that for objects with @xmath253 , a factor of 3.5 below our canonical value , the redshift at which the phase transition occurs , can be as high as three .",
    "more detailed knowledge of the @xmath41 distribution is necessary to assess how common such high redshift objects are .    in summary , from our elementary cosmological model",
    "we conclude that this new mode of star formation , where objects now akin to giant molecular clouds in our galaxy become the sites of star formation , occurs at a redshift of approximately 1.5 with a value higher by a factor of 2 if more massive initial perturbations or larger collapse factors are considered .",
    "the phase transition in the interstellar medium of protogalactic disks as analyzed in this paper is now a plausible physical reason that the formation of disks of galaxies occurs at a redshift of order unity with a significant increase in star formation after the metallicity has achieved a value of order @xmath254 .",
    "these findings are consistent with the recent studies of the hubble deep field ( cf .",
