    "<S> we study the sensitivity of the lhc , with 20 fb@xmath0 of data , to lepton flavour violating higgs boson decays @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the large population of higgses produced in gluon fusion , combined with leptonic decays of the @xmath3 , and estimate that the lhc could set a 95% confidence level bound @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this correponds to a coupling of order the cheng - sher ansatz @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> a new resonance , hereafter refered to as the higgs boson ( @xmath6 ) , was recently discovered @xcite around 126 gev . </S>",
    "<S> its couplings and branching ratios will be determined with additional data ; meanwhile , one can speculate on possible departures from standard model ( sm ) expectations . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that beyond - the - standard - model ( bsm ) physics is present in the lepton sector to generate neutrino masses , and should induce lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) higgs decays at some rate . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose that this rate could be detectable .    </S>",
    "<S> the prospects of observing lfv higgs couplings have been studied in the past , both at colliders @xcite , and in low energy experiments @xcite ( see also @xcite for supersymmetric models , and @xcite for a recent discussion with r - parity violation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy bounds , and their implications for collider searches , were studied in detail for the two higgs doublet model @xcite , and for a single higgs doublet with effective operators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they do not exclude observable @xmath1 or @xmath2 at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds that can be set from current @xmath7 data , and prospects of a dedicated @xmath1 search ( in the vector boson fusion channel ) are discussed in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this brief note advocates searching for @xmath1 with higgses produced in gluon fusion , followed by @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this channel was discussed for heavy higgs bosons in @xcite . due to the large sm gluon fusion cross section , which we denote as @xmath9 pb </S>",
    "<S> , this channel produces more signal events than producing a higgs in vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , @xmath10 pb . </S>",
    "<S> the vbf channel is used for @xmath11 because the two jets distinguish the signal in the large @xmath12 background . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case of @xmath1 , the hard @xmath13 momentum and specific missing energy allow the signal to be sufficiently distinguished from the background that one obtains an interesting sensitivity with current data . </S>",
    "<S> our sensitivity compares favourably with the results of @xcite , who studied @xmath1 following higgs production in vbf .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the lepton flavour violating higgs decays @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , because we expect the `` sm - like '' higgs to couple most strongly to the third generation . </S>",
    "<S> we only study @xmath16 , because we anticipate that the sensitivity to @xmath17 should be equivalent , or better . </S>",
    "<S> the final state particles @xmath18 are the same , so the sm backgrounds should be similar , and the detection prospects for a low @xmath19 muon from tau decay are better than those of a low @xmath19 electron .    </S>",
    "<S> the couplings of the sm higgs are flavour diagonal , so new physics is required to allow @xmath1 . for a single doublet higgs field @xmath20 , the presence of non - renormalisable operators , for instance of the form @xmath21 [ \\overline{\\ell}_\\mu h ] \\tau_r$ ] , allows flavour - changing couplings for the physical higgs field @xmath6 @xcite . in the presence of additional scalar fields , such as a 2 higgs doublet model@xcite , or the nmssm @xcite , renormalisable flavour - changing interactions can arise , provided the mass spectrum is away from the decoupling limit . @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> the production rate via gluon fusion could also be modified by new physics . for instance , in the 2hdm , neglecting the heavy charged higgses in the loop , it is multiplied by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the angle between the cp - even mass eigenstate basis and the basis where only one doublet has a vev is not uniquely defined @xcite . however , </S>",
    "<S> if the @xmath3 is the heaviest charged lepton , and @xmath24 in the ratio @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the @xmath3 yukawa coupling , then the flavour - changing vertices have a factor @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite for a detailed discussion . ] .    </S>",
    "<S> there are weak constraints on lfv higgs decays from low energy data . </S>",
    "<S> the limits from processes which the higgs could mediate at tree level , such as @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , allow @xmath30 lfv couplings to the higgs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more restrictive model - dependent bounds arise from @xmath31 ( see _ e.g. _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a single higgs , and @xcite for the 2hdm ) ; a lfv higgs coupling of order the tau yukawa is allowed .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume a single `` sm - like '' higgs at 126 gev . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we assume the change in the total decay rate due to new physics is sufficiently small that the narrow width approximation for production and decay can be used . </S>",
    "<S> most of the backgrounds arise from non - higgs mediated processes , so we study the observable br ( ) this circumvents the issue of parametrising new physics couplings . </S>",
    "<S> however , in simulating the backgrounds from higgs decays , we use the sm production rate @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this is innocuous because the higgs background is negligeable compared to the dibosons and @xmath33s .    </S>",
    "<S> our signal process is @xmath34 , where the higgs boson is produced by gluon fusion , and was simulated with the monte carlo event generator pythia version  8.162  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other production mechanisms for the higgs boson were not taken into account , since their rates are at least one order of magnitude lower . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs boson mass was set to 126  gev .    </S>",
    "<S> the background simulations from our previous study  @xcite of lepton flavour violating @xmath35 decays was used to estimate sm backgrounds leading to @xmath36 dilepton final states . </S>",
    "<S> these includes the following processes : @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and gauge boson ( @xmath40 and @xmath35 ) pair production . in the background simulations of this new analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we also included higgs boson production via gluon fusion , followed by lepton flavour conserving decays . </S>",
    "<S> the sm decays of the higgs boson leading to @xmath36 final state are : @xmath41 where both tau lepton decay leptonically , @xmath42 where both @xmath40 decay leptonically , and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> those processes were also simulated using pythia version  8.162 with a higgs boson mass of 126  gev .    </S>",
    "<S> the simulated signal and sm higgs boson backgrounds are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] ( see @xcite for similar information on other background processes ) . the sm cross section of higgs production by gluon fusion is 19.2  pb for a higgs boson mass of 126  gv with a total uncertainty of @xmath44  %  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> branching ratios from sm were used for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 decays ; those are 6.73% , 23.3% , and 2.85% , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> those monte carlo events were passed through the delphes program  @xcite , with the anti - kt jet reconstruction of fastjet  @xcite , to simulate the cms detector response as described in  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> [ cols=\"^ , < , > , > \" , ]     the number of events obtained in tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab3 ] were used to extract a limit on @xmath52 . for that purpose , </S>",
    "<S> the modified frequentist @xmath53  @xcite method was used . as in our previous study  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> a 3% systematic uncertainty was set on the signal and background yields due to experimental uncertainties on lepton identifications . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also took into account the 15% systematic uncertainty on higgs boson production via gluon fusion for the signal and for the backgrounds from sm higgs decays . the expected 95% c.l . </S>",
    "<S> limit calculated with this procedure is : @xmath54    the reach indicated by eqn ( [ eqn4 ] ) is phenomenologically interesting . </S>",
    "<S> the cheng - sher anstz @xcite , which can parametrise extra - dimensional models of flavour , gives flavour - changing couplings of order @xmath55 , where @xmath56 gev is the higgs vev . for the @xmath6 boson </S>",
    "<S> , this gives br ( ) br ( ) 4.1 10 ^ -3 where the last number applies when @xmath6 has the standard model branching ratio to taus .    </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of eqn ( [ eqn4 ] ) can be compared to the prospects of @xmath1 with higgs production via vbf ( where hadronic and leptonic tau decays could be used ) , as was studied by harnik , kopp , and zupan @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> current data indicate that the production cross sections via gluon fusion and vbf have approximately their sm values , implying more signal events in the channel @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a signal efficiency of 5.34 % . </S>",
    "<S> although the results of @xcite are presented differently from ours , the gluon fusion channel with leptonic taus , appears to have better sensitivity than vbf with hadronic taus .    </S>",
    "<S> this analysis used missing transverse energy reconstructed from the whole event . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath58 modeling in a fast detector simulation is too optimistic ; a full detector simulation including pile - up effects will enlarge @xmath58 resolution and the overlap between signal and backgrounds , thus reducing slightly the sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> these effects have to be studied by the lhc collaborations in order to perform this analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the sensitivity is worsened by a factor @xmath59 2 , if the missing transverse energy is reconstructed solely from the lepton momenta .    </S>",
    "<S> the sm higgs boson is very narrow , mostly decaying to @xmath60 via a coupling @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> its branching ratios are therefore a sensitive probe of small non - standard higgs couplings since , away from the peak of the breit - wigner , observables lose the @xmath62 amplification and are suppressed by another small higgs coupling squared . </S>",
    "<S> this is different from the @xmath35 boson , many of whose non - standard couplings are better constrained by low energy observables . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we explored the sensitivity of the lhc with 20  @xmath63 of data to a sm - like higgs boson decaying to @xmath64 or @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> we considered higgs boson production via the largest cross section , which is gluon fusion , and leptonic tau decays , because this gives a clean signature . assuming experimental systematic uncertainties of 3% , and accurate missing transverse energy reconstruction </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the lhc could exclude at 95% c.l . @xmath66 . </S>"
