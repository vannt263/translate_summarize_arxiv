    "standard cosmology requires the existence of a non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) contribution to the total energy budget of the universe @xcite . in the past few years estimates of the dm abundance have become increasingly precise .",
    "indeed , the particle data group now quotes at 1 @xmath1 c.l .",
    "@xcite @xmath2 since the data from the wmap satellite @xcite and large scale structure formation @xcite is best fitted if the dm is cold , weakly interacting mass particles ( wimp ) are currently the preferred explanation . while there is certainly no shortage of wimp candidates ( lists can be found in many reviews ,",
    "see for example @xcite ) , the literature is completely dominated by studies of the lightest neutralino .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments have shown that neutrinos have non - zero mass and mixing angles @xcite and the most recent global fits to all data @xcite confirm again that the mixing angles are surprisingly close to the so - called tri - bimaximal mixing ( tbm ) values @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) with conserved r - parity neutrino masses are zero for the same reasons as in the sm . however , it was shown long ago that if neutrinos are majorana particles , their mass is described by a unique dimension-5 operator @xcite @xmath3 all ( majorana ) neutrino mass models reduce to this operator at low energies .",
    "if @xmath4 is a coefficient @xmath5 , current neutrino data indicates @xmath6 gev .",
    "this is the essence of the `` seesaw '' mechanism .",
    "there are three different tree - level realizations of the seesaw , classified as type - i , type - ii and type - iii in @xcite .",
    "type - i is the well - known case of the exchange of a heavy fermionic singlet @xcite .",
    "type - ii corresponds to the exchange of a scalar triplet @xcite .",
    "one could also add one ( or more ) fermionic triplets to the field content of the sm @xcite .",
    "this is called seesaw type - iii in @xcite .",
    "neutrino experiments at low energies measure only @xmath7 , thus observables outside the neutrino sector will ultimately be needed to learn about the origin of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim5 ] ) . augmenting the sm with a high - scale seesaw mechanism",
    "does not lead to any conceivable phenomenology apart from neutrino masses , but if weak scale supersymmetry exists _ indirect _ probes into the high energy world might be possible .",
    "two kind of measurements containing such indirect information exist in principle , lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) observables and sparticle masses .    assuming complete flavour blindness in the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters at some large scale , the neutrino yukawa matrices will , in general , lead to non - zero flavour violating entries in the slepton mass matrices , if the seesaw scale is lower than the scale at which susy is broken .",
    "this was first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the resulting lfv processes have been studied in many publications , for low - energy observables such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 conversion in seesaw type - i see for example @xcite , for seesaw type - ii @xcite .",
    "lfv collider observables have also been studied in a number of papers , see for example @xcite .",
    "mass measurements in the sparticle sector will not only be necessary to learn about the mechanism of susy breaking in general , but might also reveal indications about the scale of the seesaw mechanism .",
    "however , very precise knowledge of masses will be necessary before one can learn about the high scale parameters @xcite .",
    "especially interesting in this context is the observation that from the different soft scalar and gaugino masses one can define certain combinations ( `` invariants '' ) which are nearly constant over large parts of msugra space . adding a seesaw mechanism of type - ii or type - iii these invariants",
    "change in a characteristic way as a function of the seesaw scale and are thus especially suited to extract information about the high energy parameters @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the `` invariants '' are constants in msugra space only in leading order and that quantitatively important 2-loop corrections exist @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study neutralino dark matter @xcite within a supersymmetric type - ii seesaw model with msugra boundary conditions . for definiteness , the model we consider consists of the mssm particle spectrum to which we add a single pair of @xmath10- and @xmath11-plets .",
    "this is the simplest supersymmetric type - ii setup , which allows one to maintain gauge coupling unification @xcite and explain measured neutrino oscillation data .    in msugra - assuming a standard thermal history of the early universe - only four very specific regions in parameter space can correctly explain the most recent wmap data @xcite .",
    "these are ( i ) the bulk region ; ( ii ) the co - annihilation line ; ( iii ) the `` focus point '' line and ( iv ) the `` higgs funnel '' region . in the bulk region",
    "there are no specific relations among the sparticle masses .",
    "however , all sparticles are rather light in this region , so it is already very constrained from the view point of low - energy data @xcite . in the co - annihilation line the lightest scalar tau is nearly degenerate with the lightest neutralino , thus reducing the neutralino relic density with respect to naive expectations @xcite . in the `` focus point '' line @xcite @xmath12 is small enough to explain @xmath13 due to a rather small value of @xmath14 leading to an enhanced higgsino component in the lightest neutralino and thus an enhanced coupling to the @xmath15 boson .",
    "lastly , at large @xmath16 an s - channel resonance pair annihilation of neutralinos through the cp - odd higgs boson can become important .",
    "this is called the `` higgs funnel '' region @xcite .",
    "the addition of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 pair at the high scale does not , in general , lead to the appearance of new allowed regions .",
    "however , the deformed sparticle spectrum with respect to msugra expectations leads to characteristic changes in the allowed regions as a function of the unknown seesaw scale .",
    "we discuss these changes in detail and compare the results to other indirect constraints , namely , the observed neutrino masses and upper limits on lfv processes .",
    "we concentrate on the seesaw type - ii scheme , since for msugra + seesaw type - i the changes in the dm allowed regions with respect to pure msugra are , in general , expected to be tiny . ) . ]",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize the main ingredients of the model and give a short discussion of msugra and the expected changes in sparticle masses in our setup with respect to msugra . in section ( [ sec : results ] )",
    "we present our numerical results .",
    "this is the main section of the current paper , where we discuss in detail how the introduction of a @xmath10 changes the predicted dm abundance as a function of the seesaw scale .",
    "we also confront the dm allowed regions with constraints from non - observation of lfv processes and briefly comment on dm in msugra with a seesaw type - i .",
    "we then close with a short summarizing discussion in section ( [ sec : cncl ] ) .",
    "in this section we summarize the main features of the model we will use in the numerical calculation . we will always refer to minimal supergravity ( msugra ) as the `` standard '' against which we compare all our results .",
    "the model consists in extending the mssm particle spectrum by a pair of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "it is the minimal supersymmetric seesaw type - ii model which maintains gauge coupling unification @xcite .",
    "msugra is specified by 4 continuous and one discrete parameter @xcite .",
    "these are usually chosen to be @xmath18 , the common scalar mass , @xmath19 , the gaugino mass parameter , @xmath20 , the common trilinear parameter , @xmath21 and the sign of @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are defined at the gut scale , the rges are known at the 2-loop level @xcite .    under @xmath22",
    "the @xmath10 decomposes as @xmath23 the @xmath17 invariant superpotential reads as @xmath24 here , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . below the gut scale in the @xmath17-broken phase the potential contains the terms",
    "@xmath29 @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 generate quark and charged lepton masses in the usual manner .",
    "in addition there are the matrices @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for the case of a complete @xmath10 ,",
    "apart from calculable threshold corrections , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are determined from @xmath40 by the rges .",
    "as long as @xmath41 gauge coupling unification will be maintained .",
    "the equality need not be exact for successful unification .    the triplet @xmath42 has the correct quantum numbers to generate neutrino masses via the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : broken ] ) . integrating out the heavy triplets at their mass scale a dimension-5 operator of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim5 ] ) is generated and after electro - weak symmetry breaking the resulting neutrino mass matrix can be written as @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the vacuum expectation value of higgs doublet @xmath45 and we use the convention @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 can be diagonalized in the standard way with a unitary matrix @xmath48 , containing in general 3 angles and 3 phases .",
    "note that @xmath49 is diagonalized by _ the same matrix as @xmath50_. this means that if all neutrino eigenvalues , angles and phases were known , @xmath33 would be completely fixed up to an overall constant , which can be written as @xmath51 .",
    "thus , current neutrino data requires @xmath37 to be lower than the gut scale by ( at least ) an order or magnitude .",
    "the full set of rges for the @xmath10 + @xmath52 can be found in @xcite and in the numerical calculation , presented in the next section , we solve the exact rges .",

    "the gauge couplings are given as @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 being the usual standard model and mssm coefficients .",
    "@xmath61 for all @xmath62 in case of a complete 15-plet .",
    "we can estimate the soft mass parameters given the above formulas for a given choice of @xmath0 and @xmath63 .",
    "we show some arbitrarily chosen examples in fig .",
    "( [ fig : ana_para ] ) .",
    "note that the result shown is approximate , since we are ( a ) using the leading log approximation and ( b ) two loop effects are numerically important , especially for @xmath64 , but not included .",
    "the figure serves to show that for any @xmath65 the resulting mass parameters are always smaller than the msugra expectations for the same choice of initial parameters ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "while the exact values depend on ( @xmath0 ) and on the other msugra parameters , this feature is quite generally true in all of the ( @xmath0 ) plane .",
    "note , that the running is different for the different scalar mass parameters , but the ratio of the gaugino mass parameters @xmath66 always stays close to the msugra expectation , @xmath67 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "( [ fig : lfvtb45 ] ) we show the results for a calculation comparing dark matter and lfv in the case of large @xmath16 . here",
    "the same constraints as in fig .",
    "( [ fig : lfvtb10 ] ) are shown , however for @xmath68 .",
    "again we show the calculation for two values of @xmath37 , since @xmath37 is the most important free parameter .",
    "it is known that at large values of @xmath16 , lfv decays are enhanced due to an enhanced chargino diagram , which in the limit of large @xmath16 scales approximately as @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "therefore , constraints on the parameter space from non - observation of lfv decays are more severe in case of large @xmath16 , leading to tighter upper limits on @xmath37 .",
    "this is clear if we compare fig .",
    "( [ fig : lfvtb10 ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig : lfvtb45 ] ) , noticing the different scales .",
    "however , because of the higgs funnel region developing for large @xmath16 , the interesting part of the parameter space enlarges compensating for the larger values of the lfv decays .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : lfvtb45 ] ) , where for @xmath70 gev ( left ) , most of the ( @xmath0 ) plane is allowed by the upper limit on @xmath71 , while for @xmath72 gev ( right ) , about `` half '' of the plane is ruled out by this limit .",
    "we have concentrated in this paper on discussing dm in msugra with a seesaw type - ii . before closing this section",
    ", we would like to briefly comment on the case of seesaw type - i . in seesaw type - i one adds two or more singlet superfields to the superpotential of the mssm .",
    "these singlets have yukawa couplings to the standard model lepton doublet and a majorana mass term , but no other couplings to any of the mssm fields .",
    "the running of the msugra soft parameters in this setup is therefore only changed by the neutrino yukawa couplings . just as in the seesaw type - ii one can estimate from current neutrino data that the yukawa couplings are order @xmath73 for the right - handed majorana mass order @xmath74 gev . depends linearly on @xmath37 , however , in seesaw type - i yukawas scale like @xmath75 . ] for any @xmath76 smaller than this number , one therefore expects that the running of the soft parameters is essentially msugra - like .",
    "( apart from small off - diagonal terms in @xmath77 , which are exactly zero in msugra . )",
    "this implies that also the dm regions should be very close to those found in the msugra case .",
    "we have confirmed this expectation by calculating the dm allowed region for our standard choice of msugra parameters and various values of the right - handed neutrino masses . even for @xmath78 at the upper limit allowed by perturbativity we did not find any significant departure from the msugra case . with the hindsight of the results shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : nufit ] ) for the seesaw type - ii this is not surprising .",
    "one exceptional case for the seesaw type - i has been discussed , however , recently in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite observed that for yukawa couplings close to one and a large value of the common trilinear @xmath20 , say @xmath79 gev , the left sneutrinos can be the next - to - lsp ( nlsp ) for small - to - moderate values of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath16 .",
    "for a sneutrino nlsp nearly degenerate with the lightest neutralino a new co - annihilation regions then shows up at small values of @xmath18 .",
    "we have repeated this calculation with three right - handed neutrinos ( @xcite use only one singlet superfield ) and confirm the sneutrino co - annihilation region for @xmath80 and large @xmath20 . however , in our calculation , if we insist on fitting the large atmospheric and solar angles , all of the region is excluded by upper limits on lfv decays , if we put the matrix @xmath81 of the casas - ibarra parameterization for the neutrino yukawa couplings @xcite to the identity matrix . as has been shown in @xcite , we could , in principle , avoid these strong constraints from lfv by a careful adjustments of the unknown parameters in @xmath81 .",
    "we did , however , not attempt to do a systematic study as to how @xmath81 has to be chosen that the sneutrino co - annihilation becomes consistent with lfv decays .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the neutralino relic density in a supersymmetric model with msugra boundary conditions including a type - ii seesaw mechanism to explain current neutrino data .",
    "we have discussed how the allowed ranges in msugra parameter space change as a function of the seesaw scale .",
    "the stau co - annihilation region is shifted towards smaller @xmath18 for smaller values of the triplet mass @xmath37 , while the bulk region and the focus point line are shifted towards larger values of @xmath19 for @xmath37 sufficiently below the gut scale .",
    "the higgs funnel , which appears at large values of @xmath16 has turned out to be especially sensitive to the value of @xmath37 .",
    "determining @xmath19 from the mass of any gaugino and @xmath18 from a sparticle which is _ not important for the dm calculation _",
    ", one could , therefore , get a constraint on @xmath37 from the requirement that the observed @xmath13 is correctly explained by the calculated @xmath12 .    on the positive side",
    ", we can remark that current data on neutrino masses put an upper bound on @xmath37 of the order of @xmath74 gev . since this is at least one order of magnitude smaller than the gut scale , the characteristic shifts in the dm regions are necessarily non - zero if our setup is the correct explanation of the observed neutrino oscillation data .",
    "even more stringent upper limits on @xmath37 follow , in principle , from the non - observation of lfv decays .",
    "a smaller @xmath37 implies larger shifts of the dm region .",
    "however , the `` exact '' upper limit on @xmath37 from lfv decays depends strongly on @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and thus can be quantified only once at least some information on these parameters is available .    on the down side",
    ", we need to add a word of caution .",
    "we have found that the dm calculation suffers from a number of uncertainties , even if we assume the soft masses to be perfectly known .",
    "the most important sm parameters turn out to be the bottom and the top quark mass .",
    "the focus point line depends extremely sensitively on the exact value of the top mass , the higgs funnel shows a strong sensitivity on both , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "finally , it is clear that quite accurate sparticle mass measurements will be necessary , before any quantitative conclusions can be taken from the effects we have discussed .",
    "unfortunately , such accurate mass measurements might be very difficult to come by for different reasons . in the focus point region",
    "all scalars will be heavy , leading to small production cross section at the lhc . in the co - annihilation line with a nearly degenerate stau and a neutralino ,",
    "the stau decays produce very soft taus , which are hard for the lhc to measure .",
    "and the higgs funnel extends , depending on @xmath16 and @xmath37 , to very large values of ( @xmath0 ) , at least partially outside the lhc reach .",
    "nevertheless , dm provides in principle an interesting constraint on the ( supersymmetric ) seesaw explanation of neutrino masses , if seesaw type - ii is realized in nature , a fact which to our knowledge has not been discussed before in the literature .",

    "<S> we calculate the relic density of the lightest neutralino in a supersymmetric seesaw type - ii ( `` triplet seesaw '' ) model with minimal supergravity boundary conditions at the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a triplet below the gut scale , required to explain measured neutrino data in this setup , leads to a characteristic deformation of the sparticle spectrum with respect to the pure msugra expectations , affecting the calculated relic dark matter ( dm ) density . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the dm allowed regions in the ( @xmath0 ) plane change as a function of the ( type - ii ) seesaw scale . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the constraints imposed on the models parameter space form upper limits on lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) decays to those imposed by dm . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we briefly comment on uncertainties in the calculation of the relic neutralino density due to uncertainties in the measured top and bottom masses . </S>"
