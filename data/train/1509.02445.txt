    "recent development of hadron spectroscopy revealed that there may exist various molecular bound states of hadrons ( observed as hadron resonances ) .",
    "in particular , the observation of the unexpected x , y , and z mesons and the follow by theoretical studies indicates that heavy quark molecules are more plausible .",
    "this can be understood from the balance between the kinetic term and the potential in the hamiltonian : a heavier system has a smaller kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "the above naive expectation motivates us to explore possible bound states composed of charmed ( or bottomed ) baryons @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) and the nucleon ( @xmath3 ) or nucleus .",
    "this is , of course , a natural extension of the hypernucleus , which is a nuclear bound state with one or more strange baryons @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xmath16 ) .",
    "hypernuclear spectroscopy in the last decades played a key role in analysing structures of hypernuclei and extracting information on the @xmath21 and @xmath22 interactions . because there is no two - body bound states in @xmath23 or @xmath24 systems and it is difficult to perform direct scattering experiments for the hyperons , it is important to get information on their interactions from the three - body or heavier nucleus with strange baryon(s ) .",
    "the idea of the charmed hypernucleus is , in fact , old @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that the su(4 ) symmetry , though it is badly broken , for the one boson exchange ( obe ) models predicts a weaker attraction between @xmath25 and @xmath3 , because the @xmath26 exchange is replaced by the @xmath27 exchange , which is suppressed by the heavier mass of the @xmath27 meson .",
    "recent re - analysis with a model based on the heavy quark effective theories suggested the possibility of bound @xmath28 states .",
    "however , the model has a difficulty in describing the short - range interaction and its prediction was very sensitive to the cutoff parameters in the one - boson exchange interaction @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we construct a potential model consisting of the long - range one - pion and one - sigma exchange interaction and the quark exchange effect based on the quark cluster model for the baryon - baryon interaction @xcite .",
    "the latter provides a short range repulsion between @xmath25 and @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath25 represents @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath29 .",
    "the model also contains the off - diagonal components , which couple @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 channels of the same total quantum numbers . by adjusting the meson exchange parameters to reproduce low - energy data of the nn system",
    ", we obtain four sets of the @xmath33 potential .",
    "we solve the coupled channel schrdinger equation using the gaussian expansion method ( gem ) @xcite and obtain @xmath7 bound states .",
    "the potential is also applied to the three - body @xmath10 system . bound state solutions are found and their properties are analysed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 , we present our model of the @xmath28 potential and explain how to determine the model parameters . in sec .  3",
    ", the two - body @xmath33 systems are analysed with the obtained potentials and the results are examined . in sec .  4",
    ", we construct an effective one - channel @xmath7 potential model and apply it to the three - body @xmath34 system .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we first consider the two - baryon systems , with isospin @xmath36 and spin - parity @xmath37 or @xmath38 . table [ tb : pot1 ] shows possible channels contributed by @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and",
    "@xmath41 for each @xmath42 .",
    "the channels with the orbital angular momentum @xmath43 and @xmath44 will be coupled by tensor force , while those with the same @xmath45 are coupled mainly by central force .",
    "we solve coupled channel schr@xmath46dinger equation in a hybrid potential model .",
    "the model includes a pion exchange potential and a scalar meson exchange potential for long - range interactions @xcite and a short - range repulsive potential coming from the quark exchanges between the baryons @xcite .",

    "one sees that one @xmath5 exchange is strongly attractive , so that even with the qcm repulsion the total potential becomes attractive .",
