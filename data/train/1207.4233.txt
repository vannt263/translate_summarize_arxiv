    "lyndon words have shown to be a useful tool for a variety of problems in combinatorics ranging from the construction of de bruijn sequences  @xcite to proving the optimal lower bound for the size of uniform unavoidable sets  @xcite .",

    "the base of the logarithm is optimal , because the fibonacci lyndon words attain the lower bound .",
    "this follows from theorem  [ ti 10 - 07 - 2012:1247 ] , in which we show that if @xmath9 is a lyndon word with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the @xmath17 fibonacci number , then the number of distinct lyndon factors in @xmath9 is at least  @xmath1 with equality if and only if @xmath9 equals one of the two fibonacci lyndon words of length @xmath16 , up to renaming letters .",
    "it also makes sense to count the number of lyndon factors of infinite words , but here we have to use caution : if an infinite word is aperiodic , it will have infinitely many lyndon factors , as we will show in corollary  [ 100620121216 ] .",
