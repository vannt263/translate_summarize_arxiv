    "the electromagnetic interactions occur at impact parameters @xmath2 larger than twice the nuclear radius @xmath3 , where no hadronic interactions can occur@xcite . in these upcs , the electromagnetic field of one nucleus acts as almost - real photon field , following the weizscker - williams approach",
    ". these photons can fluctuate into a quark - antiquark pair , which can scatter elastically from the other nucleus , emerging as a real vector meson .",
    "the photons can also fluctuate into virtual @xmath4 pairs , with one of the pions scattering from the other nucleus and emerging as a real pion pair .",
    "purely electromagnetic interactions also occur . at energy scales above  @xmath5 , for most purposes ,",
    "these may be described as two - photon interactions , although 3 ( or more ) photon interactions are also possible@xcite .",
    "these reactions can produce @xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 pairs , scalar or tensor mesons , and meson pairs@xcite . since the photons couple to charge , the production rate is a sensitive test of the internal charge content of mesons , and can be used to rule out glueball candidates .",
    "upcs occur at moderate impact parameters , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vector meson mass and @xmath10 the ( lab frame ) lorentz boost .",
    "because the electromagnetic fields are so strong , additional photonuclear interactions may accompany the vector meson production .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0 producing photon , the nuclei may exchange one or more additional photons which may excite the target nuclei into a giant dipole resonance or higher excitation . when the excited nuclei decay , they emit one or more neutrons .",
    "we report the first observation of @xmath0 production in upcs , both with and without nuclear excitation .",
    "we also observe @xmath1 pairs produced in upcs .",
    "these reactions were observed in @xmath11 collisions at a center of mass energy @xmath12 gev at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) by the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) detector .",
    "figure [ fig : event ] shows a typical event : two charged particles are visible in an otherwise empty detector .",
    "the particles are roughly back - to - back , showing that the pair has a small transverse momentum @xmath13 .",

    "the rates for exclusive @xmath0 production may be calculated using data on @xmath14 collected from hera and fixed target experiments .",

    "the calculated @xmath16 cross sections@xcite agree with data from lower energy fixed target experiments .",
    "for less - well studied mesons , the measured vector meson rates may be used to determine the meson - nucleon interaction cross sections .    the production cross section at a given photon energy @xmath18 ( in the lab frame ) maps into the rapidity @xmath19 of the final state vector meson : @xmath20 .",
    "a photon with a lab - frame energy @xmath21 is lorentz boosted to an energy @xmath22 in the target frame , so the @xmath23 center of mass energies are comparable to those reached at fermilab fixed - target experiments , somewhat below those reached at hera .    the total cross section is the integral over @xmath18 of the photon flux times @xmath16 . for gold collisions at @xmath24",

    "the amplitudes for @xmath0 production , @xmath26 , and direct @xmath25 production , @xmath27 , interfere and@xcite @xmath28 where the @xmath0 width is corrected for the increasing phase space as @xmath29 increases .",
    "the @xmath0 component undergoes a 180@xmath30 phase shift at @xmath31 , so the interference skews the @xmath0 peak shape , enhancing production for @xmath32 and suppressing the spectrum for @xmath33 .",
    "these upcs are characterized by final states with small @xmath13 because of the coherent coupling .",
    "the meson @xmath13 comes from the photon , @xmath34 and the @xmath13 acquired in the scattering , about @xmath5 , added in quadrature .",
    "vector meson production can occur at either of the nuclei ; because the strong force has a short range , the production must be inside or very near the nuclei . because it is impossible to determine which nucleus was the source , the amplitudes from the two production sites ( ions ) interfere , reducing the number of @xmath0 with @xmath35@xcite . because the short - lived @xmath0 decay before they travel the distance @xmath2 , the interference is sensitive to the post - decay wave function , and can be used for tests of quantum mechanics .",
    "electron - positron pairs may be produced in upcs by purely electromagnetic processes .",
    "although the coupling is large ( @xmath36 ) , in the kinematic range accessible to star , higher order effects are likely to be small , and the cross section is calculable based on the collision of two almost - real virtual photons@xcite .",
    "photon exchange can also excite one or both nuclei@xcite .",
    "collective excitations , such as the giant dipole resonance , are possible , along with higher energy incoherent photonuclear interactions involving hadron production .",
    "calculations indicate that , in mutual coulomb dissociation , the two excitations are likely to occur independently , via two separate photons .",
    "the cross section for mutual coulomb exchange is sizable , around 3.6 barns at @xmath37 gev@xcite .",

    "multiple photons from a single nucleus are emitted independently of each other@xcite .",

    "there are some feynman diagrams for which factorization does nt apply .",
    "for example , when photon emission excites the emitting nucleus , factorization fails .",
    "these processes have been studied for two - photon upcs , and the non - factorizing amplitudes were found to be small@xcite .",
    "it seems likely that a similar independence holds for photonuclear interactions .",
    "the star detector reconstructs charged particles using a 4.2 meter long time projection chamber ( tpc)@xcite in a 0.25  t solenoidal magnetic field .",
    "the tpc has an inner radius of 50 cm , and an outer radius of 2 m. the charged particle pseudorapidity ( @xmath19 ) acceptance depends on the position of the interaction . for the data discussed here , the interactions were radially within a few cm of the center of the tpc , but spread longitudinally ( in @xmath41 ) , with @xmath42 cm .",

    "the initial trigger decision uses lookup tables and field programmable gate arrays to initiate tpc readout about 1.5 @xmath53s after the collision .",
    "tpc readout took 10 msec , allowing for up to 100 events / sec to be read out ( at 100% deadtime ) .",
    "a higher level filter uses on - line track reconstruction by a small processor farm @xcite to remove unwanted events with vertices outside the beam interaction region .",
    "two separate triggers were used to study @xmath0 production . the first ( topology ) trigger selected events with a small number of tracks detected by the ctb .",
    "it divided the ctb into 4 azimuthal quadrants , and required a hit in the opposing north and south quadrants .",
    "events with hits in the top or bottom quadrants were vetoed as probable cosmic rays .",
    "we took 7 hours of data with this trigger , recording about 30,000 events on tape .",
    "the majority of the triggers were due to cosmic rays , beam - gas events , and debris from upstream interactions .",
    "[ fig : pctrig ]    our analysis selected events with a vertex with exactly 2 tracks within 2 cm of the centerline of the tpc , and with @xmath54 m. the track @xmath47 were required to be consistent with pions .",

    "[ fig : pctrig](a ) shows the pair @xmath13 spectrum of the selected unlike - sign ( dots - net charge 0 ) and like - sign pairs ( histograms ) .",
    "the unlike pairs are strongly peaked for @xmath56 mev / c .",
    "this is consistent with production that is coherent with both nuclei ; events with @xmath57 mev / c are considered our signal .",
    "the like - sign pairs have no such enhancement , and serve as a background sample .",
    "the like - sign pairs have been normalized to match the unlike - sign in the signal - free region 250 mev @xmath58 500 mev ; this entailed scaling them up by a factor of 2.1 .",

    "however , some of the events in the low - mass shoulder are likely due to @xmath1 pairs ; subtracting this background will decrease @xmath59 .",
    "there is no evidence for any neutrons in the zdc data from these events .",
    "data on @xmath0 production accompanied by mutual nuclear excitation were collected with the minimum bias trigger .",

    "[ fig : mbtrig]b shows the invariant masses of the @xmath25 combinations with @xmath62 mev / c .",
    "the overall background is slightly lower than for the topological trigger , but the composition is quite different . here , the like - sign pair background was scaled up by a factor of 2.3 to match the like - sign pairs in the region 250 mev / c @xmath63 500 mev / c . compared to the topologically triggered sample , the backgrounds from beam gas events and cosmic rays are greatly reduced , but the contribution due to grazing nuclear collisions is larger . despite these differences , the @xmath0 mass peak has a similar shape and @xmath59 as the topologically triggered data .",
