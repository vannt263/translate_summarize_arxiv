    "in semiconductor quantum dots , preservation of quantum coherence is an important issue for the application to the quantum information processing . to examine the coherence ,",
    "the transport measurements have been reported using an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) ring with an embedded quantum dot , as an interferometer.@xcite the ab oscillation of the current has been observed as a function of magnetic flux penetrating the ring .",
    "the conductance usually shows a breit - wigner resonance of symmetric lorentzian shape , as a function of gate voltage which changes the electrostatic potential in the quantum dot.@xcite this indicates that electrons pass by a discrete level in the quantum dot coherently by the resonant tunneling .",
    "the transmitted wave of the electrons interferes with the wave traversing the other arm of the ring ( reference arm ) , which results in the ab oscillation.@xcite    when the higher - order interference between the waves is important , the resonant shape is modified .",
    "et al_.  have observed an asymmetric peak of the conductance , as a function of the gate voltage.@xcite this is ascribable to the fano resonance , which is generally caused by the interference between a discrete level and the continuum of states.@xcite the fano resonance is observable when the wave through a discrete level interacts with the wave traversing the reference arm sufficiently before it goes out of the ring : a naive picture in the path integral formalism is as follows .",
    "an incident wave from the source is split into two arms , one includes a quantum dot and the other is the reference arm , and meets at the other side of the ring .",
    "some part of the wave goes out to the drain and the rest goes back to the original point along both arms and interacts , and so forth .",
    "if the phase relaxation length , @xmath4 , is comparable with the size of the ring , the shortest paths dominantly contribute to the current and result in the ab oscillation .",
    "then we observe the breit - wigner resonance , as a function of gate voltage , which reflects the amplitude of a wave through the quantum dot .",
    "if @xmath4 is much larger than the ring size , the contribution from many paths modifies the resonant shape to the fano resonance ; an asymmetric shape with peak and dip is produced by positive or negative interference on either side of the breit - wigner resonance where the phase shift differs by @xmath5 from each other . in ref .  , the asymmetric shape of the current becomes a symmetric one when the bias voltage increases .",
    "this implies that the finite bias significantly reduces @xmath4 .",
    "the resonances in the ab interferometer have been theoretically studied by several groups .",
    "@xcite the electron - electron interaction has been investigated , which leads to the `` fano - kondo effect.''@xcite few theoretical work , however , has been done for the decoherence in the transport under a finite bias . in our previous paper , we have considered the dephasing effect in the reference arm phenomenologically on the fano resonance.@xcite the dephasing effect on the ab oscillation by the spin - flip has been studied ( in the case of breit - wigner resonance ) when an odd number of electrons are localized in the quantum dot.@xcite    in the present paper , we examine the decoherence in the resonances by the electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interaction .",
    "although the e - ph interaction in quantum dots has been studied by several groups,@xcite the bias - voltage dependence has not been clarified even in the breit - wigner resonance .",
    "hence we discuss the e - ph interaction under a finite bias in the breit - wigner resonance as well as in the fano resonance .",
    "the aims and main results of our study are as follows .",
    "\\(i ) first of all , we study the effects of longitudinal optical phonons on the breit - wigner resonance . to calculate the current under a finite bias",
    ", we adopt the keldysh green function method@xcite and consider the e - ph interaction by the perturbation expansion.@xcite within the second - order perturbation , we distinguish elastic and inelastic processes at zero temperature . when the bias voltage is smaller than the phonon energy @xmath1 , only the elastic process takes place , in which electrons virtually emit and absorb phonons .",
    "this process does not cause the dephasing , but it suppresses the resonant peak height without any change of the peak width .",
    "when the bias voltage is larger than @xmath1 , an inelastic process is possible , in which electrons actually emit phonons .",
    "this results in the dephasing@xcite and broadens the peak width .",
    "\\(ii ) in some papers , @xcite the e - ph interaction is treated by the canonical transformation method , in which e - ph interaction is considered exactly in the quantum dot , whereas its effect on the tunnel coupling is disregarded .",
    "we calculate the breit - wigner and fano resonances with optical phonons by the method . by comparison with the perturbation calculation",
    ", we find some problems with the canonical transformation method to obtain the bias - voltage dependence .",
    "\\(iii ) we examine the effects of acoustic phonons on the breit - wigner resonance and fano resonance . for the purpose ,",
    "we extend the self - consistent born approximation to the finite - bias transport in the keldysh green function formalism.@xcite we find strong suppression of the peak height in the breit - wigner resonance since both elastic and inelastic processes are possible even at low bias in the case of acoustic phonons . in the fano resonance",
    ", we show that the asymmetric shape is significantly influenced so that the dip almost disappears .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the experimental results.@xcite    concerning ( i ) , marquardt and bruder have studied the elastic and inelastic processes in sequential tunneling through two quantum dots in parallel ( double - dot interferometer).@xcite they have discussed `` renormalization effect '' in the elastic process and `` dephasing '' in the inelastic process .",
    "the former stems from the difference between the ground state of an environment in the presence or absence of an electron in the quantum dots .",
    "the effect reduces the effective tunnel coupling between the quantum dots and leads .",
    "this is not the case in our resonant tunneling in which an electron virtually stays in a quantum dot , with emitting and absorbing phonons , in the elastic process .",
    "we do not find the reduction of the peak width , whereas the zero - point fluctuation of the phonons decreases the resonant peak height .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present our model for the ab interferometer with an embedded quantum dot .",

    "a subpeak structure is not observed since the acoustic phonon has a continuous spectrum .",
    "we find the following effects of the e - ph interaction .",
    "( i ) the resonant peak height decreases with increasing the bias voltage . as discussed in the previous section",
    ", this should be mainly ascribable to the elastic process .",
    "( ii ) the peak width is more broadened with the bias voltage , which is due to the inelastic process . the emission of phonons results in the finite lifetime and hence an increase in the resonant width .",
    "( iii ) the form of the breit - wigner resonance becomes asymmetric .",
    "the resonant peak is more suppressed on the side of @xmath184 than on the side of @xmath185 .",
    "this may be explained as follows .",
    "when @xmath186 , phonons can be emitted in the electron tunneling from lead l to the quantum dot , or in the tunneling from the dot to lead r. when @xmath187 , phonons can be emitted only in the latter .",
    "hence the decoherence works differently on both sides of the resonance .",
    "figure [ fig : fig8](a ) shows the fano resonance with acoustic phonons , in the presence of reference arm ( @xmath63 , @xmath152 ) .",
    "the bias voltage is @xmath176 ( dashed line ) and @xmath177 ( solid line ) .",
    "a subpeak structure is not seen as in the breit - wigner resonance with acoustic phonons .",
    "the e - ph interaction decreases the resonant amplitude , whereas it increases the resonant width , reflecting the real emission of phonons .",
    "these effects are more prominent with larger bias .",
    "particularly , the resonant dip becomes almost invisible with high bias and as a result , the asymmetric shape of the fano resonance grows like a symmetric one .",
    "although this is in qualitative accordance with the experimental results,@xcite the resonant peak is still in an asymmetric form even in a smaller size of quantum dots ( with stronger e - ph interaction , as discussed below ) than in the experiment . to explain the experimental results quantitatively",
    ", we would have to consider the e - ph interaction in the reference arm as well as inside the quantum dot .",
    "the other dephasing effects , e.g.  spin - flip of a localized electron in the quantum dot , might be also important .",
    "we change the size of the quantum dot , @xmath39 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8](b ) : @xmath188 ( dotted line ) , @xmath189 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath190 ( solid line ) .",
    "the bias voltage is fixed at @xmath191 . with an decrease in the dot size , the matrix element @xmath192 in the coupling coefficient",
    "@xmath34 increases [ see eq .  ] . in consequence ,",
    "the effect of e - ph interaction is enhanced .",
    "the figure indicates smaller amplitudes and wider widths of the resonance in smaller quantum dots .",
    "we have investigated the breit - wigner resonance and fano resonance in quantum dots with e - ph interaction . using keldysh green function method and perturbation with respect to the e - ph interaction ,",
    "we have obtained the bias - voltage ( @xmath0 ) dependence of the decoherence .    with optical phonons of energy @xmath1 , we distinguish elastic and inelastic processes .",
    "when @xmath2 , only the elastic process takes place in which electrons emit and absorb phonons virtually .",
    "the process suppresses the resonant amplitude , whereas it does not change the resonant width .",
    "we do not observe the renormalization of the tunnel coupling which has been discussed in the sequential tunneling.@xcite when @xmath3 , the inelastic process is possible , which broadens the resonant width .",
    "the process also makes a subpeak , as a function of the energy level in the quantum dot , corresponding to the real emission of phonons .",
    "we can not obtain any bias - voltage dependence of the decoherence when we consider the e - ph interaction by the canonical transformation method , neglecting its effect on the tunnel coupling .    with acoustic phonons ,",
    "the suppression of resonant amplitude and broadening of the resonant width are more prominent with an increase in the bias . in the fano resonance ,",
    "the resonant dip becomes almost invisible .",
    "the asymmetric resonant shape becomes like a symmetric one , in qualitative accordance with the experimental results.@xcite however , the model with e - ph interaction in the quantum dot only is not sufficient for the quantitative explanation of the experiment .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use the term of dephasing for the real emission of phonons in the inelastic process .",
    "this is because the elastic process does not result in the dephasing , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "in the presence of reference arm , one might think that the dephasing effect can be directly evaluated by calculating the amplitude of ab oscillation .",
    "but it is not correct .",
    "the e - ph interaction leads to the elastic and inelastic processes in the quantum dot on one hand , it changes the ratio of the current through the reference arm to that through the quantum dot on the other hand .",
    "hence the amplitude of the ab oscillation can not measure the dephasing effect correctly .",
