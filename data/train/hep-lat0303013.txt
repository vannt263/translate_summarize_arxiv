    "<S> the prescription dependence is removed in quenched qcd through a continuum extrapolation , and the dependence of the pressure , @xmath3 , on @xmath0 is obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important objects in the study of hot and dense hadronic matter is the phase diagram , particularly , the location of the critical end point , characterised by the temperature @xmath4 and the chemical potential @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> much effort has been expended recently on estimating these quantities at finite lattice spacing , @xmath6 , using , implicitly @xcite or explicitly @xcite , a taylor series expansion of the free energy density . </S>",
    "<S> this needs the non - linear susceptibilities which define the response to an applied @xmath0 beyond quadratic order . </S>",
    "<S> an equally important question for phenomenology arises from the fact that present day heavy - ion collision experiments access the part of the qcd phase diagram with @xmath71080 mev , , baryon chemical potential @xmath830250 mev @xcite , far from @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it is then pertinent to ask how relevant the @xmath9 lattice qcd computations of quantities such as the pressure , @xmath3 , are to these experiments .    in this paper </S>",

    "<S> we uncover essential lattice artifacts , but manage to quantify and remove them in the process of taking the continuum limit . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly construct a taylor series expansion for @xmath3 at @xmath10 , put limits on the region of linear response , , of reliable extrapolations , and show that the @xmath9 lattice computations are clearly relevant to experiments . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting sidelight is that there is strong evidence of short thermalisation times in the dense matter formed in these heavy - ion collisions @xcite , which may be related to large values of transport coefficients @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most computations of such dynamical quantities are based on linear response theory . </S>",
    "<S> the success of the linear approximation in static quantities at fairly large driving also gives us confidence in using linear response theory for dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting point is that the radius of convergence of a taylor series expansion started near @xmath11 @xcite must give information on the location of the critical end - point , @xmath12 , through the taylor coefficients , , the non - linear susceptibilities . </S>",
    "<S> since these taylor coefficients turn out to be prescription dependent and subject to strong finite lattice spacing effects , it seems that present day estimates of the end point will have to be sharpened strongly before they can be used as a guide to phenomenology .    </S>",

    "<S> a perturbative expansion in the continuum proceeds through an order - by - order enumeration of interaction terms . in the continuum the diagrams in figure [ fg.ops ] are the leading order ( ideal quark gas ) part of the perturbative expansion of the susceptibilities , where each vertex corresponds to the insertion of a @xmath40 ( since the chemical potential enters the lagrangian as @xmath41 ) . </S>",

    "<S> we also show later ( table [ tb.quench ] ) that uncertainties of almost 20% are also expected from other finite lattice spacing effects even within one prescription , and lattice spacings of @xmath69 may be required to find @xmath5 stable within statistical error bars .    </S>",
    "<S> this freedom of choosing a prescription has specific consequences for the third and higher derivatives of @xmath17 , and through them for the non - linear susceptibilities , and hence for @xmath15 , @xmath3 and all quantities at finite @xmath0 and @xmath6 . at @xmath27 , </S>",
