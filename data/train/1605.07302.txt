    "in non-@xmath1-wave cooper pairing states , quasiparticle scatterings from system surfaces and nonmagnetic impurities can lead to suppression of the order parameter .",
    "one typical example of such anisotropic pairing states would be the spin - triplet @xmath2-wave one which is realized in superfluid phases of liquid @xmath0he .",
    "in contrast to superconductors whose properties are closely connected to the underlying crystal symmetries , bulk superfluid @xmath0he is a highly clean homogeneous system , so that the cooper pair can potentially take all the possible symmetries within the spin - triplet @xmath2-wave sector . in reality , however , only two superfluid phases are realized in the bulk @xmath3he , b and a phases which are respectively identified with the balian - werthamer ( bw ) and the anderson - brinkman - morel ( abm ) pairing states @xcite .",
    "the former is a full gapped state appearing in the wide range of the temperature - pressure phase diagram , and the latter with point nodes at both poles of the fermi sphere is stabilized by the strong - coupling effect only in the high - temperature and high - pressure region .",
    "the most interesting question is whether or not pairing states other than the abm and bw ones may appear in superfluid @xmath0he confined in thin slabs , narrow cylinders , and porous media such as aerogels . since orbital degrees of freedom of the superfluid order parameter",
    "are strongly restricted due to the scatterings from such foreign objects , the pure bulk states can be unstable in these geometries .    in the bw state in a film geometry , surface - normal components of the order parameter are locally suppressed near specular system surfaces . as the film thickness becomes small ,",
    "these components get smaller even inside the film and the bw state is eventually deformed into the planar pairing state the nodal structure of which is the same as that of the abm state @xcite . the relative stability between the planar - distorted bw pairing state and the abm one depends on the strength of the strong - coupling effect which varies as a function of pressure @xcite . in experiments ,",
    "it has been observed that the stability region of the a phase is extended in thin slabs @xcite . on the other hand , in aerogels , interconnected silica strands work as nonmagnetic impurities for superfluid @xmath0he , giving rise to intriguing phenomena .",
    "there , pinning effects of the @xmath4-vector in the abm state have been extensively studied @xcite , and the polar pairing state with a line node along the equator of the fermi sphere was predicted to appear in uniaxially stretched media @xcite .",
    "recently , the existence of this polar phase has been experimentally confirmed in nematically - ordered aerogels @xcite .",
    "also in narrow cylinders , the occurrence of the polar state is theoretically predicted @xcite , but so far , any signature of this state has not been observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient common to the above cases is a global anisotropy .",
    "it lowers the effective dimensionality of the system favoring the anisotropic pairing states . in such quasi - low dimensional systems",
    ", one may naturally expect that the superfluid state is spatially uniform along scattering - free directions , namely , the in - plane and cylinder - axis directions for the slabs and cylinders , respectively . near the continuous transition from the bw state into the planer or polar states , however , the surface scattering yields periodic spatial structures along these scattering - free directions @xcite .    from recent theoretical studies of the surface scattering effect on unconventional superconductors and superfluids , it is becoming clear that the surface - induced gap distortion triggers instability of spatially modulated cooper pairing states in quasi - low dimensional systems @xcite",
    "they are analog of the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state @xcite which was originally studied in the context of spin - singlet superconductors in a strong zeeman field , and are characterized by a nonzero center of mass momentum of the cooper pair @xmath5 .",
    "the occurrence of the fflo - like @xmath6 state in superfluid @xmath0he was first pointed out by vorontsov and sauls for a film with two specular surfaces @xcite . near the bw - planar transition in the film ,",
    "the bw state exhibits a one - dimensional modulation characterized by @xmath5 within the film plane .",
    "this modulated bw state is called `` stripe order '' . after their prediction",
    ", it is shown that the stripe order may be possible also in cylindrical geometry @xcite . in narrow cylinders , however ,",
    "the stripe order can be stable only when the system surface is specular and diffusive along the cylinder axis and rim , respectively .",
    "this indicates that the stability of the stripe order is sensitive to whether the surface scattering is specular or diffusive . for the slab geometry ,",
    "it is not clear whether the stripe order can survive for any scattering conditions or not ( quite recently , the strong - coupling effect and surface - roughness effect have been theoretically studied @xcite , and we will discuss these issues later on ) .",
    "in addition , it is also an interesting question how the midgap states in the @xmath0he b phase are modified by the periodic stripe structure .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider thin films of superfluid @xmath0he and investigate ( 1 ) surface - roughness effects on the stripe order and ( 2 ) quasiparticle excitations in this spatially modulated phase . throughout this paper ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to liquid @xmath0he at 0 bar which is considered to be in the weak - coupling limit @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that the stripe order can exist even in a film with one specular and one diffusive surfaces and that the stripe structure induces a new gapped bound state distinctly different from the conventional surface andreev bound state .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we introduce the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free - energy functional and examine the surface scattering effects on the bw pairing state .",
    "the mechanism of the stripe order and its stability against surface roughness are discussed based on the gl theory . in sec.iii",
    ", we investigate low - energy quasiparticle excitations in the stripe order by solving the eilenberger equation to obtain the local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "there , for simplicity , we have used the spatial profile of the order parameter obtained in sec.ii , i.e. , in the gl theory .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in sec.iv .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the stability of the stripe order in the bw pairing state confined in a quasi - two dimensional system with thickness @xmath7 .",
    "the system geometry is shown in fig.[fig:4](a ) .",
    "the two - dimensional plane is extending in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane , and quasiparticles are scattered on the system surfaces located at @xmath10 .",
    "hereafter , three patterns of surface conditions will be considered : ( a ) both surfaces are specular , ( b ) the upper surface is specular while the lower one is diffusive , and ( c ) both surfaces are diffusive .",
    "the case ( a ) corresponds to the ideal superfluid @xmath0he film which can be realized by coating slab surfaces with @xmath11he @xcite .",
    "the situations ( b ) and ( c ) describe superfluid @xmath0he on a rough substrate and in a slab without the @xmath11he coat , respectively .",
    "we will first visit the simplest case ( a ) , which has been already discussed in @xcite , to clarify the mechanism of the stripe order near the bw - planer transition , and next examine the surface roughness effect . throughout this section",
    ", we ignore the abm pairing state because it has the same condensation energy as that of the planar pairing state in the weak coupling limit .",
    "the gap function of the spin - triplet @xmath2-wave cooper pairing state is generally given by @xmath12 with pauli matrices @xmath13 @xmath14 and complex variables @xmath15 which play a role of the order parameter of this system .",
    "properties of liquid @xmath0he near the superfluid transition temperature @xmath16 are well described by the gl theory @xcite .",
    "as our main focus is on pairing states of a superfluid film with its thickness @xmath7 less than the dipole length @xmath17 m , we will neglect the dipole interaction .",
    "the corresponding functional is obtained as an expansion in the order parameter @xmath15 @xmath18 in the weak coupling limit , the coefficients are given by @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 with @xmath23 as density of states per spin on the fermi surface and @xmath24 as the superfluid coherence length at @xmath25 .",
    "note that this definition of @xmath26 is based on ref.@xcite and is different from that in ref.@xcite by the factor of @xmath27 .",
    "the effect of the system surface can be incorporated by the boundary condition on the order parameter @xmath28 . for the specular surface scattering , the surface - normal component of the quasiparticle momentum @xmath29 changes its sign by the mirror reflection at @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes a unit vector normal to the surface . because the gap function should satisfy the equation @xmath33 at the surfaces ,",
    "the surface - normal component of the order parameter must vanish at the system surface while parallel components should be unchanged .",
    "thus , the boundary condition on @xmath28 at the specular surface reads @xmath34 when the surface is sufficiently rough such that quasiparticles are randomly scattered independent of the incident direction , the boundary condition eq.([eq : boundary_sp ] ) is replaced with the diffusive one , i.e. , @xmath35 for any @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "now , we turn to the instability of the stripe order with @xmath6 in the bw state . in the bw state in the slab geometry , the order parameter is usually assumed to be uniform in the two - dimensional plane ( @xmath8-@xmath9 plane ) , and its basic form is given by @xmath38 .",
    "because of the boundary condition eq.([eq : boundary_sp ] ) , @xmath39 vanishes at @xmath10 .",
    "it has been known that due to the surface - induced gap suppression , the bw state is gradually deformed into the planar pairing state @xmath40 as film thickness @xmath7 becomes small @xcite .",
    "below , we will see that near the bw - planar transition @xmath41 , the bw state lowers the energy by introducing the spatial modulation @xmath5 in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane and extends its stability region to higher temperatures . for brevity , we take into account spatial variations in the order parameter only along the @xmath8 direction , assuming that the modulation , namely , periodic stripe structure is introduced in the @xmath8 direction ( see fig.[fig:4](a ) ) . as @xmath8 components of the order parameter",
    "are generally relevant to spatial variations in the @xmath8 direction , we start from the bw state of the form @xmath42    by expanding @xmath43 in a fourier series with respect to @xmath8 and picking up relevant leading order terms , we have the following form of the order parameter which can be continuously deformed into @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the wave vector characterizing the spatial modulation of the order parameter in the @xmath8 direction , and @xmath47 has been dropped because its contribution is known to be negligibly small @xcite . as we will see below , not only the off - diagonal component itself @xmath48 but also the phase difference of @xmath49 between sine waves in @xmath48 and @xmath50 is important for the occurrence of the stripe order .       in a film with thickness @xmath7 and specular surfaces .",
    "@xmath41 for the bw state with a one - dimensional spatial modulation in the film plane ( solid curve ) is higher than that for the uniform bw state ( black dashed one ) .",

    "( c ) the spatial profile of the order parameter along the @xmath8-axis in the striped bw state with @xmath57 .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ]    the mechanism of the stripe order in the cylindrical geometry has been already addressed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the origin of the stripe order in film superfulid @xmath0he can be understood in a similar way .",
    "we first consider the case with specular surface scattering and take the following trial state satisfying eq.([eq : boundary_sp ] ) , @xmath58 translational symmetry breaking in the bw state is signaled by finite values of @xmath51 .",
    "inserting the expression eq.([eq : op_trial ] ) into eq.([eq : gl ] ) and integrating over @xmath59 and @xmath8 , we obtain @xmath60 , \\nonumber\\\\ f_g & = & \\delta_2 ^ 2 \\big(\\frac{3}{4 } \\frac{\\pi^2}{d^2}+ \\frac{1}{4 } q^2 \\big ) + \\delta_3 ^ 2 \\big ( \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{\\pi^2}{d^2 } + \\frac{3}{4}q^2",

    "the coefficients are calculated as @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "it should be emphasized here that the gradient term linear in @xmath51 shows up . by minimizing @xmath69 with respect to @xmath51",
    ", we obtain @xmath70 which is nonzero as long as @xmath54 and @xmath55 are nonzero .",
    "the gradient energy for the optimal @xmath51 is lower than that for @xmath71 by @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the system tends to introduce the modulation @xmath51 to lower @xmath69 leading to the stripe order .",
    "this situation is in sharp contrast to conventional fflo states for which a @xmath51-linear gradient term does not exist and nonzero @xmath51 appears just because the coefficient of the @xmath73 term becomes negative at very low temperatures for strong zeeman fields @xcite .",
    "the present system is , however , rather similar to non - centrosymmetric superconductors ( ncs ) with rashba spin - orbit coupling @xcite in a magnetic field where the so - called helical phase with a field - induced phase modulation @xmath74 is believed to be realized @xcite . in rashba - type ncs",
    ", broken inversion symmetry allows a @xmath51-linear gradient term coupled with the field , and as a result , the phase modulation exists even at the superconducting transition temperature in the magnetic field . from the analogy to ncs , it is inferred that the modulated bw state would emerge from high temperatures near @xmath16 .",
    "figure[fig:1](a ) shows the @xmath52 curves for the bw states of the form eq.([eq : op_trial ] ) with ( solid curve ) and without ( dashed one ) a one - dimensional modulation in the two - dimensional plane . the @xmath41 transition temperature is higher for @xmath75 than that for @xmath71 , which implies that the superfluid state with broken translational symmetry is stabilized as the lowest energy bw state .",
    "it is striking that the stripe order with @xmath75 appears from relatively high temperatures near @xmath16 , while the conventional fflo state is realized only in the low temperature region . in the superfluid @xmath0he film ,",
    "the @xmath51-linear term coupled with @xmath55 ( amplitude of @xmath48 ) yields the @xmath75 pairing state , and thus , the internal degrees of freedom of the order parameter play an essential role for the striped superfluid phase .",
    "we also note that the @xmath51-linear term exists only when we have the phase difference of @xmath49 between sine waves in @xmath48 and @xmath50 .    in fig.[fig:1](b )",

    "@xmath51 develops with decreasing film thickness .",

    "we have used the general form of @xmath28 , eq.([eq : bw_op ] ) . comparing figs.[fig:2](a ) and",
    "( b ) , one can see that the stability region of the stripe order shrinks as the surface scattering becomes more diffusive .",

    "one can see that the trial state eq.([eq : op_trial ] ) well describes the spatial profiles of @xmath88 .",
    "correspondingly , the stripe - planar transition curve obtained by solving gl equations is in quantitative agreement with the one calculated with the variational method based on eq.([eq : op_trial ] ) . on the other hand , in the case ( b ) , as is shown in fig.[fig:2](d ) , @xmath89 are squashed to zero at the lower diffusive surface , and as a result , @xmath89 exhibit large spatial variations near the diffusive surface .",
    "although such large spatial variations cost much gradient energy , the stripe order is still stable as the @xmath51-linear gradient term can lower the _ net _ gradient energy like in the case with two specular surfaces .    in the case ( c ) where both surfaces are diffusive , @xmath89 must be zero at the both upper and lower surfaces , which results in a large spatial variation in @xmath90 in the striped bw state with @xmath75 . by using the spatial profiles of @xmath89 compatible with the diffusive condition",
    "@xmath91 we can evaluate the gradient energy as @xmath92 comparing eqs.([eq : gl_trial ] ) and ( [ eq : gl_trial_df ] ) , one can see that @xmath51-relevant terms are almost unchanged , while the associated energy cost for @xmath90 , which corresponds to @xmath93 in eq.([eq : gl_trial_df ] ) , is much enhanced . because the large spatial variation in @xmath90 lowers the net energy gain , the stripe order becomes less stable . in the variational method using eq.([eq : op_trial_df ] ) , @xmath52 for the @xmath75 state is higher than the one for the @xmath86 state only by less than @xmath94 of @xmath52 for @xmath95 .",
    "such a result is also obtained from exact numerical solutions of the gl equations .",
    "thus , the uniform and striped bw states are almost degenerate near @xmath52 .",
    "this suggests that the stability region of the stripe phase is restricted in the vicinity of the @xmath52 curve .",
    "in fact , numerical calculations for determining the lower phase boundary show that the uniform bw phase extends up to near @xmath52 and the striped bw phase is possible only in a very narrow region below @xmath52 .",
    "it is , however , difficult to accurately determine the lower phase boundary because near @xmath52 the free energy difference between the two states is very small compared with numerical errors .",
    "the phase diagram in the case ( c ) is therefore not shown in fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "the above our results are obtained in the weak coupling limit without the strong - coupling effect which favors the abm pairing state in the bulk . in general , when the strong - coupling corrections are incorporated , the stability region of the stripe order may be modified .",
    "recent theoretical work has shown that even in the presence of the strong - coupling contributions , the stripe order can survive for moderately diffusive surfaces with its stability region being suppressed at high temperatures , while it exists only in the vicinity of @xmath25 for maximally diffusive surface scatterings @xcite .",
    "although in ref.@xcite , it is assumed that the strong - coupling contributions in a slab can be evaluated from the corresponding bulk values , they might be quite different from those in the bulk like in the case of superfluid @xmath0he in globally anisotropic aerogels @xcite , but this issue is beyond the scope of this work .",

    ", we will consider the typical case with two specular surfaces .",
    "for the specular scattering , we have seen in the previous section that the simplified form of the order parameter eq.([eq : op_trial ] ) well describes superfluid properties near the stripe - planar transition , so that we could expect that eq.([eq : op_trial ] ) should work also for examining quasiparticle excitations in the stripe order .",

    "for the trajectory slightly tilted from the surface normal , @xmath121 is very small at the surfaces [ figs.[fig:4](b)-(d ) ] , while for a highly tilted one , @xmath121 is relatively large at the surfaces [ figs.[fig:4](e ) and ( f ) ] . in the case of @xmath119 ( parallel to the stripe ) , @xmath121 exhibits a simple periodic behavior associated with multiple surface scatterings , which can be seen in fig.[fig:4](b ) .",
    "by contrast , in the case of @xmath118 ( perpendicular to the stripe ) , an additional longer - period oscillation occurs , as is shown in figs.[fig:4](c)-(f ) .",
    "this large oscillation is associated with the one - dimensional modulation of the stripe order . in figs.[fig:4](c ) and ( d ) , one can see that near @xmath124 , the large oscillation works as a confinement potential for the quasiparticles at the domain boundary ( fig.[fig:4](d ) ) , while it works as a energy barrier at the domain center ( fig.[fig:4](c ) ) .",
    "that s the reason why the bound state exists at the domain boundary ( see the left panel of fig.[fig:3](c ) ) , while it does not near @xmath126 at the domain center ( see the left panel of fig.[fig:3](a ) ) . comparing figs.[fig:4](c - d ) with ( e - f ) , one finds that as the trajectory is tilted from the surface normal , namely , @xmath128 increases , the amplitude of the large oscillation becomes small .",
    "this indicates that such a reduction of the energy barrier should lead to the overlap of the wave functions localized at each valley in @xmath121 , resulting in the midgap state appearing from a finite value of @xmath128 at the domain center .     for the specular - surface film with the thickness @xmath56 .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) are results at the domain center a ( @xmath115 ) and the domain boundary c ( @xmath117 ) , respectively .",
    "red solid ( green dashed ) curves denote ldos s at the surface ( center ) of the film . in the inset of ( b ) , the bound state energy gap @xmath129 is plotted as a function of @xmath51 ; from right to left , data points correspond to @xmath130 at @xmath114 , and @xmath131 at @xmath132 .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ]    figures [ fig:5](a ) and ( b ) show the angle - averaged ldos s at the domain center and boundary for the thickness @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the overall feature of the ldos is almost unchanged along the @xmath59 axis for a fixed @xmath8 , while the low - energy behavior depends on @xmath8 .",
    "as one can see in fig.[fig:5](a ) , the ldos at the domain center with nonzero @xmath50 exhibits a linear behavior near @xmath133 due to the contribution of the surface states extending from the upper and lower surfaces , which is consistent with the previous result for thin films @xcite . on the other hand , one can see in fig.[fig:5](b ) that the spectrum at the domain boundary has a kink near @xmath134 .",
    "this kink originates from the bound state associated with the modulation of the stripe order .",
    "actually , the kink position coincides with the bound state energy at @xmath126 @xmath135 ( see the left panel of fig.[fig:3](c ) ) .",
    "now , the question is what determines the bound state energy gap @xmath129 .",
    "since the bound state is formed due to the confinement potential shown in fig.[fig:4](d ) , it is natural to expect that @xmath129 is related to the shape of the potential which is characterized by the period of the stripe structure @xmath51 . in the inset of fig.[fig:5](b ) , @xmath129 is plotted as a function of @xmath51 for various film thicknesses .",
    "@xmath129 is well scaled by @xmath51 , suggesting that the bound state energy gap @xmath129 is closely connected to the period of the stripe .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the surface - roughness effect on the stability of the stripe order in thin films of the superfluid @xmath0he b phase based on the ginzburg - landau theory in the weak coupling limit , and also investigated the quasiparticle excitations in this striped superfluid phase by solving the eilenberger equation .",
    "although the occurrence of the stripe order was originally pointed out for a film with two specular surfaces , it is found that the stripe order survives even in a film with one specular and one diffusive surfaces which should correspond to superfluid @xmath0he on a substrate .",
    "our numerical results on the angle - resolved local density of states ( ldos ) show that a new bound state distinct from the surface andreev bound state appears for classical trajectories running across the stripe .",
    "this unconventional bound state originates from the one dimensional modulation of the order parameter , namely , the stripe structure , and is reflected as a kink in the angle - averaged ldos .",
