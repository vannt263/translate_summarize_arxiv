    "neutron stars and black holes are the most compact objects , as such they provide an arena for the observation of strong gravitational effects predicted by the general theory of relativity .",
    "an important relativistic effect is the dragging of inertial frames , first predicted by lense and thirring ( lense and thirring 1917 ) .",
    "the lense - thirring frame dragging causes zero angular momentum observers ( zamo s ) to orbit around a rotating body with non - zero angular velocity .",
    "if the orbit is inclined to the body s equatorial plane , the plane of the orbit will precess .",
    "it has recently been noted ( stella and vietri 1998a ) that the precession frequency due to the frame - dragging effect has approximately the right magnitude and radial dependence to explain observations of accreting neutron stars made by the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) satellite .",
    "if this interpretation is confirmed , it would provide a confirmation of the lense - thirring effect that includes its radial dependence , a test that is beyond reach of any other current or planned experiment to test frame dragging .",
    "the other interesting implication of this proposal is that it may be possible to constrain the neutron star s equation of state , since the magnitude of the effect depends strongly on the star s density profile . in order to determine whether the frame - dragging effect has been observed ,",
    "the details of the dependence of the precession rate on position and the star s mass , angular velocity and equation of state must be known . in this paper",
    "we will numerically compute the precession frequencies predicted by general relativity .",
    "the magnitude of the lense - thirring effect increases with the rotating body s angular momentum and compactness , so that it is largest for rapidly rotating neutron stars and black holes . however , the measurement of the frame - dragging due to the earth s motion appears to be within reach and several groups are actively pursuing this possibility .",
    "the gravity probe b experiment ( everitt et al . 1993 and references therein ) is designed to measure the precession of gyroscopes in orbit around the earth to an accuracy in the percent range , while a lower accuracy measurement of the lense - thirring precession of the orbit of the lageos satellites has been reported ( ciufolini et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",
    "both experiments are very difficult since the frame - dragging precession is many orders of magnitude smaller than the precession due to the earth s oblateness predicted by newtonian gravity . the possibility of measuring frame - dragging due to the motion of neutron stars or black holes is attractive since the precession due to oblateness , while still important is smaller than the frame - dragging precession .",
    "rxte has recently discovered kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) in the x - ray light curves of over 15 accreting neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries ( see van der klis 1998 for a review ) .",
    "this discovery is remarkable , since the dynamical frequency of a particle in circular orbit at radius @xmath2 ( in geometric units g = c=1 ) is in the range of @xmath3 khz for a @xmath4 non - rotating neutron star .",
    "thus , it is now possible to observe the region close to a neutron star where the gravitational field is strong and effects due to general relativity are important .",
    "the x - ray observations have shown that the khz qpo power spectrum peaks typically occur in pairs .",
    "the frequency of each qpo peak varies with time , often in response to x - ray flux , and therefore mass accretion rate , variations .",
    "however , in nearly all cases , the separation between the qpo peaks remains constant .",
    "a number of these neutron stars belong to the  atoll \" class and emit sporadic type i x - ray bursts , likely originating from thermonuclear flashes in the freshly accreted material on their surface .",
    "rxte revealed that during x - ray bursts an additional modulation of the x - ray flux is present , the frequency of which is consistent with either one or two times the khz qpo peak separation frequency .",
    "these phenomena are most readily interpreted on the basis of the beat - frequency modulated accretion scenario originally suggested to interpret the lower frequency quasi periodic signals observed from accreting neutron stars and white dwarfs ( see e.g. van der klis 1995 and references therein ) . in beat frequency models",
    "the higher frequency khz qpo peak corresponds to the orbital frequency of clumps of matter at the inner boundary of the accretion disk .",
    "the lower frequency khz qpo peak is the beat frequency , corresponding to the difference between the clumps orbital frequency and the star s spin frequency .",
    "this model naturally leads to the conclusion that the peak separation should be constant and equal to the star s spin frequency .",
    "application of the beat frequency model to the accreting neutron stars observed by rxte indicates that they are spinning with periods close to @xmath5 , although the modulation observed during some of type i x - ray bursts suggests that they might be spinning twice as fast .",
    "beat frequency models differ mainly with respect to the physical mechanism that determines the inner boundary of the accretion disk .",
    "this might be the presence of a neutron star magnetosphere ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al .",
    "1985 ) , or the supersonic radial velocity of the disk material induced by radiation drag or the motion inside the innermost stable circular orbit , isco ( miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) .",
    "another important aspect of the phenomenology of khz qpo sources is that they display broad lower frequency qpo peaks , the frequency of which is correlated with the frequency of the khz qpo peaks . in three ",
    "atoll \" sources @xmath6  hz qpos are observed ; in the case of 4u1728 - 34 the frequency of these qpos varies roughly with the square of the higher khz qpo frequency ( stella and vietri 1998a ) . in the higher luminosity",
    " z \"- type sources gx5 - 1 and gx17 + 2 the frequency of the @xmath7  hz  horizontal branch \" qpos appears also to depend quadratically on the frequency of the higher khz qpos ( stella and vietri 1998a , b ) .",
    "it is this correlation between peaks which has suggested the following modification of the beat frequency model : if the star s accretion disk is tilted with respect to the star s equatorial plane , the orbital plane will precess due to the combined effect of frame - dragging and stellar oblateness . for orbits near a neutron star spinning with a period of @xmath5 ,",
    "the frame dragging effect is dominant and yields precession frequencies of a few tens of hz which vary approximately as the square of the orbital frequency ( stella and vietri 1998a ) .",
    "close to the star the precession due to oblateness and other corrections due to general relativity will also be important and will cause departures from the quadratic scaling law .",
    "the principal purpose of this paper is to investigate in greater detail the precession frequency and its dependence on orbital frequency predicted by general relativity .",
    "this will provide a more accurate means of testing the precession hypothesis using many simultaneous observations of the qpo peaks in both the tens of hz and khz range .",
    "qpo peaks have also been observed in x - ray binaries which probably contain black holes .",
    "it has been proposed that some of these qpo peaks also be identified with disk precession ( cui et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",
    "rotating black holes are much simpler than neutron stars since their gravitational fields are completely specified by the kerr geometry depending on only the hole s mass and angular momentum .",
    "for this reason , measurements of precession near black holes have the potential to provide a much cleaner measurement of the lense - thirring effect .",
    "however , it should be noted that additional ( khz ) qpo peaks corresponding to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 periodicities of spherical orbits have not yet been observed yet in black hole candidates , so that the precession hypothesis rests upon scarcer evidence and quantitative testing based on multiple qpo peaks is currently not a possibility . in any case , a thorough investigation of the precession of spherical orbits in the kerr black hole geometry has been performed ( wilkins 1972 , merloni et al .",
    "1998 ) , so we will instead concentrate here on neutron star spacetimes .    in the calculations presented in this paper , it will be assumed that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity .",
    "the frame - dragging precession could hypothetically be used to test the validity of general relativity or other alternative theories of gravity using the parameterized post - newtonian framework ( will 1993 ) .",
    "however , the uncertainty in the equation of state for neutron stars would render it very difficult ( or impossible ) to differentiate between alternate theories of gravity .",
    "we restrict our attention to the simplest possible model , a thin keplerian disk tilted infinitesimally from the star s equatorial plane .",
    "both the corotating and counterrotating cases will be presented and discussed .",
    "although this model may be oversimplified , it should suffice to capture the essential physical features of the problem and place accurate limits on the precession frequencies predicted by general relativity .",
    "accurate codes ( komatsu et .",
    "1989 , cook et .",
    "1992 , salgado et .",
    "al . 1994 ) now exist which can integrate the einstein field equations for rapidly rotating neutron stars given a barotropic perfect fluid equation of state .",
    "our method is to compute the spacetime metric of the neutron star using a code written by stergioulas ( 1995 ) which is equivalent to cook et .",
    "al.s code and accurate to at least @xmath10 ( stergioulas and friedman 1995 , nozawa et .",
    "the geodesic equations for test particles in the numerical spacetime can then be solved , yielding the orbital and precession frequencies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ s : models ] the predictions of general relativity regarding the orbital motion of a precessing test particle are reviewed and the numerical methods used to solve the characteristic frequencies are outlined . in section  [ s : asymptotic ]",
    "an asymptotic expansion of the precession formula is derived in order to discuss the validity of the approximate newtonian formula .",
    "the neutron star parameters which were selected are described in section  [ s : description ] .",
    "in section  [ s : general ] general results are presented for a variety of equations of state , stellar masses and angular velocities . these results are compared with the power spectra of the lmxbs observed by rxte . we find that for corotating orbits the observed precession frequencies are somewhat lower than predicted using the approximate method of stella and vietri ( 1998a ) , therefore increasing the discrepancy between the predicted precession frequency and the observations , especially for  z \"- type khz qpo sources .",
    "these conclusions and their consequences are discussed in the final section .",
    "the neutron star models which we compute are assumed to be stationary , axisymmetric , uniformly rotating perfect fluid solutions of the einstein field equations .",
    "the assumptions of stationarity and axisymmetry allow the introduction of two commuting killing vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 , generating rotations and time - translations as well as coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath13 , defined by the conditions ( see eg . , friedman , ipser and parker , 1986 ) t^_t = ^_= 1 , t^_= ^_t = 0 , labeling the two - surfaces spanned by the killing vectors . as a result , the metric , @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 where the metric potentials @xmath16 and @xmath17 depend only on the coordinates @xmath18 and @xmath9 . the function @xmath19 is the relativistic generalization of the newtonian gravitational potential ; the time dilation factor between an observer moving with angular velocity @xmath17 and an observer at infinity is @xmath20 .",

    "it is necessary to carefully choose a sample of models which cover a reasonable volume of the allowed parameter space .",
    "we have chosen a set of four equations of state : a , wff3 , c , l ( in order of increasing stiffness ) which cover a range of possible neutron star properties .",

    ", it can be understood how the the total prograde precession frequency varies with @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "if @xmath125 is held fixed and @xmath124 allowed to vary , @xmath126 will increase quadratically , causing the precession due to oblateness to grow rapidly . the overall effect will be to reduce the total precession .",

    "a small linear increase in @xmath64 will tend to increase the lense - thirring precession while the oblateness precession will not change very much .",
    "hence , we expect that the total precession will increase .",
    "once @xmath64 is larger than @xmath128 , the quadratic dependence of the oblateness precession will cause @xmath52 to decrease with increasing @xmath64 .",

    "the quadrupole moments listed in these tables are computed using the method described by laarakkers and poisson ( 1997 ) and agree with their results when models overlap . the quadrupole moments scale roughly as the square of @xmath125 for stars of constant mass for slow rotation .",
    "quadrupole moments for stars spinning at a rate different from those listed in the tables can be found by finding the quadrupole moment for a star with the same mass and scaling appropriately .",
    "the quadrupole moment for a star with mass different from the masses listed in the tables in the present paper or that of laarakkers and poisson can be found by interpolation .",
    "within beat frequency models , the observed variations in the centroid frequency of the khz qpos in a given source , correspond to changes in radial position of the inner edge of the accretion disk around the neutron star . as the radius changes , the orbital and precession frequencies will change in a correlated fashion .",
    "if the precession is dominated by the l - t effect , then the precession should vary as the square of orbital frequency ( stella and vietri 1998a ) .",
    "close to the star relativistic effects may be important and large deviations from the quadratic behaviour may occur .    in figures [ grapha1 ] - [ graphl2 ] graphs of precession frequency versus kepler ( or orbital ) frequency are plotted for a subset of the stars featured in tables 1 - 4 .",

    "the termination of each curve corresponds to the smallest radius ( or highest orbital frequency ) at which a particle can orbit the star .",

    "we note that for eos wff3 and c , masses in the range @xmath132 provide the closest fits .",
    "l , a mass near @xmath133 comes closest to producing precession frequencies near one half the observed values .",
    "it should be noted that for eos l , the general relativistic effects produce a considerably smaller precession frequency than was predicted from the semi - newtonian analysis done by stella and vietri ( 1998a ) .",
    "data from other atoll sources show a similar trend .",
    "for example , the source ks 1731 - 260 ( wijnands and van der klis 1997 ) spinning at either @xmath134 or @xmath135 hz , shows a broad feature centred about 27 hz when the higher frequency khz qpo is at 1200 hz . again , the predicted precession frequencies are close to half of what is observed , if the star is spinning with a frequency of 260 hz . however , it the star is spinning at 520 hz , then the theoretical precession frequencies are close to the observed qpo . in table 6",

    "if the star is rotating at @xmath113 hz , the predicted precession rate is still too low : eos c predicts a precession rate of only 20 hz for the @xmath139 star .",

    "we conclude then that the precession frequencies computed are correct to within @xmath10 .",
    "we have computed the dependence of precession frequency on orbital frequency for a wide variety of neutron star masses , spins and equations of state . in doing so",
    "we have made a number of simplifying assumptions about the physics of the region close to the neutron star .",
    "the main assumptions used in this paper are :    1 .",
    "some physical mechanism exists to tilt the inner orbits of the accretion disk out of the star s equatorial plane .",
    "2 .   all forces on particles in the disk s inner region besides gravity are negligible .",
    "the perturbations causing the tilt create only an infinitesimal tilt angle .",
    "it has long been thought that the combination of viscosity and gravito - magnetism always act to keep the inner ( @xmath168 ) region of an accretion disk co - planar with the star ( bardeen and petterson 1975 ) .",
    "however , recent calculations have shown that it is possible for warped precessing disk modes to exist in the inner disk region .",
    "ipser ( 1996 ) applied perfect fluid perturbation theory to show that such modes are possible .",
    "the modes which he finds for the kerr black hole metric are fairly low , @xmath169 . adopting the formalism of papaloizou and pringle ( 1983 ) , markovi and lamb ( 1998 )",
    "have included viscosity in the computation and have shown that a family of highly localised and weakly damped tilt modes exist close to the inner disk boundary which precess at a frequency very close to the local precession frequency .",
    "alternatively it has been demonstrated that if the accretion disk matter is inhomogeneous , diamagnetic blobs can be lifted above the equatorial plane ( where they will start precessing ) through the resonant interaction with the star s magnetic field ( vietri and stella 1998 ) .",
    "our assumption that gravity is the only force acting on particles in the inner region will not always be valid .",
    "miller ( 1998 ) has shown that the interaction of radiation emitted close to the neutron star surface with the disk particles can have an important effect on the precession frequency , increasing it by a large factor .",
    "the effect is most pronounced for high luminosity sources ( approaching the eddington limit , such as z - sources ) .",
    "however , it is unclear that the approach discussed by miller ( 1998 ) is applicable to warped disks of high thomson depth . in the framework of inhomogeneous accretion disks ,",
    "the effects of radiation drag on individual diamagnetic blobs are probably negligible ( vietri and stella 1998 ) . in any case , the frequencies calculated in this paper should be treated as baseline frequencies for neutron stars which might be modified by the inclusion of other physics .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that the physical mechanisms explored so far will only produce a small tilt out of the equatorial plane .",
    "if , however , the tilt angle is large , the present results can nevertheless be used to estimate the precession frequency . to do so",
    ", we recall that the lense - thirring frequency is unaffected by the tilt angle , while the newtonian quadrupole precession is multiplied by a factor of @xmath170 , where @xmath97 is the angle between the disk and the star s equatorial plane .",
    "inclusion of this factor in the approximate post - newtonian formula ( [ approx_prec ] ) will provide a good estimate of the precession of orbits tilted by a large angle .",
    "finally , we note that the precession frequencies which we compute are a factor of @xmath171 smaller than the low - frequency ( @xmath6  hz ) qpos observed in the atoll sources , that stella and vietri ( 1998a ) interpreted in terms of precession frequency . in order for precession to explain these results , a physical or geometric mechanism to produce qpos at twice the theoretical frequency must be developed .",
    "a possibility is that a modulation at twice the precession frequency is generated at the two points where the inclined orbit of diamagnetic blobs intersect the disk ( vietri and stella 1998 ) .",

    "<S> general relativity predicts that a rotating body produces a frame - dragging ( or lense - thirring ) effect : the orbital plane of a test particle in a non - equatorial orbit precesses about the body s symmetry axis . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we compute the precession frequencies of circular orbits around rapidly rotating neutron stars for a variety of masses and equations of state . </S>",
    "<S> the precession frequencies computed are expressed as numerical functions of the orbital frequency observed at infinity . </S>",
    "<S> the post - newtonian expansion of the exact precession formula is examined to identify the relative magnitudes of the precession caused by the lense - thirring effect , the usual newtonian quadrupole effect and relativistic corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the first post - newtonian correction to the newtonian quadrupole precession is derived in the limit of slow rotation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the post - newtonian precession formula is a good approximation to the exact precession close to the neutron star in the slow rotation limit ( up to @xmath0  hz in the present context ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the results are applied to recent rxte observations of neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries , which display khz quasi - periodic oscillations and , within the framework of beat frequency models , allow the measurement of both the neutron star spin frequency and the keplerian frequency of the innermost ring of matter in the accretion disk around it . for a wide range of realistic equations of state , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the predicted precession frequency of this ring is close to one half of the low - frequency ( @xmath1 hz ) quasi - periodic oscillations seen in several atoll sources . </S>"
