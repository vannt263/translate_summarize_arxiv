    "qualitatively , the directed blast wave solution has been already discussed by rhoads ( 1999 ) .",
    "a non - directed explosion ( with @xmath3 ) does not have a universal intermediate asymptotic during the ultra - relativistic stage . the blandford - mckee ( 1976 )",
    "selfsimilar solution is an intermediate asymptotic only for a spherically symmetric explosion ( gruzinov 2000 ) .",
    "a generic non - directed explosion acquires spherical symmetry only at the non - relativistic stage , when it asymptotes to the sedov - taylor - von neumann attractor solution .",
    "qualitatively , the non - universality of the blandford - mckee selfsimilar solution follows from causality .",
    "the shock of the blandford - mckee solution moves with lorentz factor @xmath4 .",
    "consider a light signal propagating along the shock , starting at a polar angle @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath6 , which , for @xmath7 , gives @xmath8 .",
    "two regions of the shock , separated by angle @xmath9 , do not talk to each other until the blast wave slows down to @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , the selfsimilar solution derived here has a shock of opening angle @xmath11 .",
    "the angular structure of the blast wave is not imposed by hand ",
    "it appears dynamically , from an arbitrary initial state ( satisfying the directed explosion requirement @xmath12 ) .",
    "numerical simulations confirm the universality of the resulting selfsimilar solution .",
    "it is thought that ultra - relativistic blast waves are responsible for the observed gamma - ray burst afterglows ( piran 1999 ) .",
    "universality of the blast waves resulting from directed explosions should be of interest for astrophysics ( rhoads 1999 ) .",
    "we give the main result in  2 , derive it in  3 , and describe the numerical simulations in  4 .",
    "selfsimilar directed blast wave is an axisymmetric flow with a shock .",
    "the shock is roughly parabolic .",
    "the head of the parabola moves at about the speed of light .",
    "the energy - containing part of the flow is a narrow shell behind the shock , with a growing opening angle .",
    "consider a directed explosion of energy @xmath1 which sends an ultra - relativistic blast wave into the medium of uniform density @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be cylindrical coordinates , @xmath15 is the axis of the directed explosion  meaning that the explosion occurs on the @xmath15-axis , with the explosion momentum in the positive @xmath15 direction .",
    "then the ( proper ) pressure @xmath16 , the lorentz factor squared @xmath17 , and the radial ( cylindrical radial ) velocity @xmath18 behind the shock front are given by the following expressions @xmath19    here @xmath20 are dimensionless functions of dimensionless variables @xmath21 .",
    "both the dimensionless variables and dimensionless functions are order unity quantities .    the characteristic time @xmath22 and",
    "the dimensionless variables are given by the following expressions @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a dimensionless number of order unity .",
    "the solution applies for @xmath25 , that is for large negative @xmath26 , when equation ( [ at1 ] ) gives an ultra - relativistic flow ( with @xmath27 ) .",
    "we were able to calculate the dimensionless functions only approximately , with some @xmath28% accuracy .",
    "the flow fields @xmath0 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , are given in figures ( 1 , 2 ) . due to some inconvenient numerical features of the attractor solution ( slow convergence of the energy integral ,",

    " for the initial opening angle of the blast @xmath31 , we find @xmath32 .",
    "once the good variables are identified ( blandford and mckee 1976 ) , the computation is straightforward and very similar to the linearized case ( gruzinov 2000 ) . in this section",
    "we    1 .   write the relativistic hydrodynamics equations and the shock jump conditions in cylindrical coordinates , 2 .",
    "simplify the equations assuming the ultra - relativistic flow , 3 .",
    "find the right self - similar ansatz , and derive the equations describing the selfsimilar functions @xmath20 , 4 .",
    "perform the next similarity transformation , and find the asymptotic form of the functions @xmath20 in the far downstream region .",
    "relativistic hydrodynamics equations are written as @xmath33 ( landau & lifshitz 1987 ) . here",

    "the energy - momentum is @xmath35 in the shocked fluid .",
    "the energy - momentum in the unshocked fluid , @xmath36 , has only one non - zero component , and without loss of generality in the final result , we take @xmath37 . the shock position can be represented by the zero isosurface of a scalar field : @xmath38 at the shock .",

    "this normalization gives order unity values for all other quantities .    the right way to find the attractor is to solve the equations ( [ ultras])-([ultras1 ] ) .",

    "far from the head of the blast wave , at large values of @xmath85 , the selfsimilar attractor equations have a selfsimilar solution corresponding to the power law shock position @xmath86    if @xmath87 , the energy integral ( [ energy ] ) diverges .",
    "this does not mean that we may automatically dismiss such solution .",
    "it might rather indicate that the attractor ( [ at1 ] ) is never fully filled up .",

    "but we were unable to determine the true value of @xmath97 theoretically .",
    "_ the direct numerical simulations (  4 ) give marginal evidence that @xmath98 ( the case @xmath88 has positive @xmath18 for all @xmath99 , the case @xmath98 has negative @xmath18 for large enough @xmath99 , we do see negative velocities in the far downstream region ) .",
    "we therefore tentatively conclude that @xmath100 .",
    "since @xmath97 is so close to the minimal value @xmath88 , the energy integral ( [ energy ] ) converges very slowly . as a result",
    ", only extremely directed explosions can reach the pure attractor stage .",
    "explosions with initial opening angles of order 0.1 or 0.01 produce only a partial attractor  the attractor is being filled up throughout the entire quasi - selfsimilar stage .",
    "this should give small ( algebraic ) corrections to the exponential decay laws of maximal energy and pressure of the pure solution ( [ at1 ] ) .",
    "direct numerical simulations (  4 ) give @xmath101 , to about 10% .",

    "initially , the blob had the @xmath104 to @xmath15 size ratio equal to 1:20 .    figures ( 1,2 ) show the final state of the blob , in the appropriately rescaled variables .",
    "the dimensionless constant @xmath24 was calculated from the initial energy of the blob and the inferred time constant @xmath22 measured from the numerical solution .      1",
    ".   maximal energy density @xmath105 of the flow decreased just somewhat faster than exponentially .",
    "2 .   position of the shock @xmath106 grew almost exponentially .",

    "total energy per logarithmic interval of energy density was approximately constant for low energy densities , corresponding to @xmath101 .",
    "the time constant @xmath22 inferred from the rate of change of maximal energy density @xmath105 , was approximately equal to @xmath108 , in agreement with ( [ ultras1 ] ) .",
    "we should not have expected a better than 10% agreement .",
    "first , lax method does not give accurate maximal values ( which theoretically occur at the shock ) .",
    "at resolution of 400x400 , some of the inferred values change by about 10% .",
    "second , we are simply not ultra - relativistic enough .",
    "we stop at the maximal lorentz factor of about 5 . a fair fraction of the flow has too small lorentz factors . finally , because of the slow convergence of the energy integral (  3 ) , the attractor is being filled up all the time  hence faster than exponential decrease of the maximal energy density ."
