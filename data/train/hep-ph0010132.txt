    "because of the still lacking rigorous explanation of confinement , the nonperturbative nature of quarks and gluons inside hadrons can be explored by extracting information from distribution ( df ) and fragmentation functions ( ff ) in hard scattering processes .",
    "there are three fundamental df that completely characterize the quark inside hadrons at leading twist with respect to its longitudinal momentum and spin : the momentum distribution @xmath1 , the helicity distribution @xmath2 and the transversity distribution @xmath3 . at variance with the first two ones",
    ", @xmath3 is difficult to address because of its chiral - odd nature .",
    "a complementary information can come from the analysis of the hadrons produced by the fragmentation process of the final quark , namely from ff . so far , only the leading unpolarized ff , @xmath4 , is partly known , which is the counterpart of @xmath1 .",
    "the basic reason for such a poor knowledge is related to the difficulty of measuring more exclusive channels in hard processes .",
    "the new generation of machines ( hermes , compass , rhic ) and planned projects ( elfe , epic ) allow for a much more powerful final - state identification and , therefore , for a wider and deeper analysis of ff , particularly when final state interactions ( fsi ) are considered . in this context , naive `` t - odd '' ff naturally arise because the existence of fsi prevents constraints from time - reversal invariance to be applied to the fragmentation process  @xcite .",
    "this new set of ff includes also chiral - odd objects that become the natural partner needed to isolate @xmath3 .",
    "the presence of fsi allows that in the fragmentation process there are at least two competing channels interfering through a nonvanishing phase .",
    "however , this is not enough to generate naive `` t - odd '' ff . excluding _",
    "ab initio _ any mechanism breaking factorization , there are basically two ways to describe the residual interactions of the leading hadron inside the jet : assume the hadron moving in an external effective potential , or model microscopically independent interaction vertices that lead to interfering competing channels .",
    "in the former case , introduction of an external potential in principle breaks the translational and rotational invariance of the problem .",
    "further assumptions can be made about the symmetries of the potential , but at the price of loosing interesting contributions to the amplitude such as those coming from naive `` t - odd '' ff  @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the difficulty consists in modelling a genuine interaction vertex that can not be effectively reabsorbed in the soft part describing the hadronization .",
    "this poses a serious difficulty in modelling the quark fragmentation into one observed hadron because it requires the ability of modelling the fsi between the hadron itself and the rest of the jet  @xcite .",
    "therefore , here we will consider a hard process , semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) , where the hadronization leads to two observed hadrons inside the same jet .",
    "a new set of interference ff arise at leading twist  @xcite and their symmetry properties are briefly reviewed . for the hadron pair being a proton and a pion with invariant mass equal to the roper resonance , we have already estimated these ff using an extended version of the diquark spectator model  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "fsi come from the interference between the direct production of the two hadrons and the decay of the roper resonance . here",
    ", we present results for the hadron pair being two pions with invariant mass around the @xmath0 mass .",
    "in analogy with semi - inclusive hard processes involving one detected hadron in the final state  @xcite , the simplest matrix element for the hadronisation into two hadrons is the quark - quark correlation function describing the decay of a quark with momentum @xmath5 into two hadrons @xmath6 , namely @xmath7 where the sum runs over all the possible intermediate states involving the two final hadrons @xmath8 . since the three external momenta @xmath9 can",

    "we have explicitly checked that diagram  [ f : mradici:3]b reproduces the experimental transition probability for @xmath38 production in the relative @xmath40-channel .",

    "we infer the vertex form factors from previous works on the spectator model  @xcite .",
    "however , there numbers should be taken as indicative , since the ultimate goal is to verify that nonvanishing `` t - odd '' ff occur , particularly when integrating on some of the kinematical variables and possibly washing all interference effects out . results of analytical calculation of eq.([e : mradici : specdelta ] ) show that @xmath45 and @xmath46 . after integrating over @xmath47 while keeping @xmath48 in the horizontal plane of the lab ( usually identified with the scattering plane )",
