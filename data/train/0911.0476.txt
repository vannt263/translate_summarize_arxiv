    "the concept of weight plays an important role in characterizing the features of complex systems in nature , since many different correlations in the real world can be represented by weighted links . in the past decade , as an emerging network dynamics , weight dynamics has attracted a large number of scientific communities  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that many biological , technological , and social systems are best described by weighted networks , as the nodes interact with each other with varying strength . to describe the variety ,",
    "a link between two nodes is associated with a weight in the weighted network .",
    "the weight of a link can represent different properties for different networks .",
    "for a social network , link weight can indicates the intimacy between two individuals  @xcite ; for the internet , link weight can represent the bandwidth of an optical cable between two routers  @xcite ; for the world - wide aviation network , link weights can reflect the annual volume of passengers traveling between two airports  @xcite ; and for the _ e.  coli _ metabolic network , link weight can encode the optimal metabolic fluxes between two metabolites  @xcite .",
    "previous studies have pointed out the importance of the link weight of networks and led to the formulation of a long list of models aimed at incorporating the characteristics in weighted networks  @xcite . among these models ,",
    "the one proposed by barrat , barthlemy and vespignani ( bbv )  @xcite has been deemed to be the pioneer and classic work by most physics communities . the main contribution of their work can be ascribed to two aspects : a new strength driven preferential attachment mechanism ; local weight and strength rearrangements for a new link .",
    "the results of this model represent many behaviors observed empirically in real - world networks , e.g. , link weight - degree correlation , node strength - degree correlation , and scale - free topology .",
    "currently , a primary purpose of the study of complex networks is to understand how their dynamical behaviors are influenced by underlying geometrical and topological properties  @xcite . among many fundamental structural characteristics",
    "@xcite , clustering coefficient , also known as transitivity , is an important topological feature of complex networks , generating considerable attention . in the sociological literature , for example",
    ", it is referred to as the  network density \" . for node @xmath0 with @xmath1 links ,",
    "@xmath2 denote the fraction of these allowable edges that actually exist .",
    "the local clustering coefficient for the whole system is given as the average of @xmath2 for each vertex  @xcite .",
    "as is known , average local clustering coefficient is one of the two key criterions to judge whether a network or a complex system possess the small - world property .",
    "most previous related studies have been confined to numerical methods , which is , however , prohibitively difficult for large networks because of the limit of time and memory .",
    "hence , there is a need to give out a analytical solution of the clustering coefficient toward providing a useful insights into topological structures of complex networks .    despite the necessity , to the best of our knowledge , the rigorous computation for the clustering coefficient of bbv model",
    "has not been addressed , contrasting sharply with the successes in other network properties such as degree , weight and strength distribution  @xcite . to fill this gap , in this present paper",
    "we investigate this interesting quantity analytically .",
    "we derive an exact formula for the clustering coefficient characterizing the bbv model . the analytic method we adopt in the work ,",
    "is an extended mean field approach .",
    "the obtained precise result shows that the average local clustering coefficient of bbv network has a power - law decrease with the number of nodes . to some extent",
    ", our research opens a way to theoretically study the clustering coefficient of neutral or nonassortative mixing  @xcite weighted networks on the one hand . on the other hand",
    ", our exact solution may give insight different from that afforded by the approximate solution of numerical simulation .",
    "the bbv network starts from an initial seed of @xmath3 vertices fully connected by links with assigned weight @xmath4 .",
    "a new vertex @xmath5 is added at each time step .",
    "this new site is connected to @xmath6 previously existing vertices ( i.e. , each new vertex will have initially exactly @xmath6 edges , all with equal weight @xmath4 ) , choosing preferentially sites with large strength ; i.e. , a node @xmath0 is chosen according to the probability @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the strength of the node @xmath0 , defined as @xmath9 .",
    "the weight of each new link @xmath10 , is initially set to a given value @xmath4 .",
    "the creation of this edge will introduce a local variations of the edge weight @xmath11 , in which node @xmath12 is one of node @xmath0 s neighbors and node strength of node @xmath13 , where this perturbation is proportionally distributed among the edges according to their weights .",
    "@xmath14    simultaneously , this rule yields a total strength increase for node @xmath0 of @xmath15 , implying that @xmath16 . in this paper , we focus on the case of homogeneous coupling with @xmath17 and equivalently set @xmath18 .",
    "after the weights and strengths have been updated , the growth process is iterated by introducing a new vertex , until the desired size of the network is reached .    in bbv networks , the dynamical process for @xmath8 and @xmath1",
    "can thus be described by the following evolution : @xmath19 @xmath20 note that @xmath21 runs over the nearest neighbors of the node @xmath0 . solving these two equations with initial conditions @xmath22 , one can have @xmath23  @xcite , and @xmath24    after introducing the bbv model , we now investigate analytically the clustering coefficient of all the nodes in the bbv networks .",
    "as is known , like ba networks , the clustering coefficient in bbv networks rapidly decreases with the network size @xmath25 . in the previous studies , researchers give out numerical calculations to show this mechanism while we will offer an exact solution to explain it in what follows .    [ 0.3 ] for ( a ) @xmath26 and ( b ) @xmath27 , ( averaged over @xmath28 bbv networks ) .",
    "red circles show the analytical solutions given by eq .",
    "( [ citi ] ) .",
    "note that the @xmath29 axis is nonlinear.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "before introducing the way to calculate the clustering coefficient , it is necessary to build up a conception , ` what is neutral weighted networks ' , at first .    in networks ,",
    "the degree of a node is defined as the number of links the node has .",
    "a relevant topological property is the degree - degree correlation , or so - called assortative mixing .",
    "it is defined as a preference for high - degree vertices to attach to other high - degree vertices and vice versa  @xcite . by contrast ,",
    "disassortative mixing is defined as a preference for high degree vertices preferentially connect with low degree ones and vice versa .",
    "however , a network with neutral degree correlation means neither assortative nor disassortative .",
    "a random network , where links are randomly connected between nodes , is an example of neutral networks .",
    "along with the degree correlations , we introduce the weighted degree correlations  @xcite , defined as @xmath30 the @xmath31 thus measures the effective affinity to connect with high- or low - degree neighbors according to the magnitude of the actual interactions .",
    "as well , the behavior of the function @xmath32 marks the weighted assortative or disassortative properties .",
    "when @xmath33 increases with @xmath34 , it means that nodes have a tendency to connect to nodes with a similar or larger degree . in this case",
    "the network is defined as assortative .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath33 is decreasing with @xmath34 , which implies that nodes of large degree are likely to have near neighbors with small degree , then the network is said to be disassortative .",
    "naturally , if correlations are absent , it can be ascribed to weighted neutral networks .    of particular interest",
    "is the bbv model mentioned in section  [ sec : bbv ] can give rise to neutral networks , for small @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "however , for increasing @xmath35 , the disassortative character and a power - law behavior of @xmath36 emerge . fortunately , their weighted assortativity @xmath33 is a constant , that is , they belong to weighted neutral networks . in this case , we redefine the linking probability of node @xmath0 and @xmath12 , @xmath37 for the sake of extending the mean field method to this particular network for large @xmath35 .",
    "[ 0.8 ] as a function @xmath38 for ( a ) @xmath26 and ( b ) @xmath27 .",
    "results are obtained by numerical simulations on bbv networks ( averaged over 10 networks ) .",
    "peachblow lines show the analytical solutions given by equation  ( [ cit ] ) , and black curves are the smoothed data of simulation data ( gray circles).,title=\"fig : \" ]    in a bbv network , consider consequently a certain node @xmath0 at time step @xmath25 .",
    "note that we only consider the case @xmath39 in that the bbv network is close to tree - like networks when @xmath40 .",
    "as is known to us all , for a tree network , the clustering coefficient in the network is equal to zero . by the definition  @xcite ,",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath41 depends on two variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "its definition is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of links between the @xmath1 neighbors of @xmath0 .    since in the bbv model only new nodes may create links , the coefficient @xmath41 changes only when its degree @xmath43 changes , i.e. , when new nodes create connections to @xmath0 and @xmath46 of its nearest neighbors .",
    "the appropriate equation for changes of @xmath41 is then @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the change of the clustering coefficient when a new node connects to the node @xmath0 and to @xmath49 of its first neighbors as well , whereas @xmath50 describes the probability of this event .",
    "notice that , in the equation  ( [ dcidt ] ) , @xmath48 represents the difference between clustering coefficients of the same node @xmath0 calculated after and before a new node attachment @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "also , the equation  ( [ eq1a ] ) gives out the restricted region of our method .",
    "the probability @xmath50 is a product of two factors . @xmath53",
    "the first factor is the probability of a new link to end up in @xmath0 , which is given by equation  ( [ pi ] ) .",
    "the second one is the probability that @xmath49 among the rest of @xmath54 new links connect to the nearest neighbors of @xmath0 .",
    "it is equivalent to the probability that @xmath54 bernoulli trials with the probability @xmath55 for @xmath49 successes .",
    "so that , @xmath56 replacing the sum @xmath21 by an integral , one obtains @xmath57 where , @xmath58 in which @xmath59 is the weight of the link @xmath10 . in bbv networks , @xmath60 where @xmath61",
    "hence , using the equation  ( [ sj+ ] ) and one can find the probability @xmath62 now , inserting equation  ( [ si ] ) , ( [ ki ] ) , ( [ eq1a ] ) and ( [ pix ] ) into equation  ( [ dcidt ] ) one can obtain @xmath63}&\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{t^{\\frac{-3}{2\\delta+2}}}{2\\delta(\\delta+1)^2}\\cdot\\frac{m(m-1)(2\\delta+1)}{mt^{\\frac{2\\delta+1}{2\\delta+2}}+(2m\\delta+2\\delta+1)t^{\\frac{2\\delta+1}{2\\delta+2}}_i}.&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the derivation process , we simplify @xmath64 to make the analytical integral easily executed . solving the equation for @xmath41",
    "one gets @xmath65^{-2}\\cdot&\\nonumber\\\\ & \\left[b_i+\\frac{m^2}{4(1+\\delta)\\delta^2}\\left(\\frac{2t^{\\frac{3\\delta}{\\delta+1}}t^{-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta+1}}_i - t^{\\frac{3\\delta}{\\delta+1}}t^{-\\frac{2\\delta}{\\delta+1}}_i-6t^{\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta+1}}}{6}\\right ) \\right],\\ \\ & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is an integration constant for the node @xmath0 and determined by the initial condition @xmath67 that describes the clustering coefficient of the node @xmath0 exactly at the moment of its attachment @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath52 in equation  ( [ eq1a ] ) , we have @xmath68 .",
    "thus , in this article , it is worth noticing that @xmath35 has to be confined in the region @xmath69 .",
    "the restriction is given by our approximation in equation  ( [ prox ] ) .",
    "we believe this drawback will be addressed in future work .",
    "to clarify the calculation of @xmath70 , we show another form of the definition of @xmath2  @xcite , @xmath71 it can be rewritten as @xmath72    figure  [ fig_citi ] shows the prediction of the equation  ( [ citi ] ) in comparison with numerical results . for small values of @xmath38",
    "the numerical data differ from the theory significantly .",
    "this incongruity is caused by the formula for the probability of a connection @xmath73 in equation  ( [ pij ] ) used three times in equation  ( [ citi ] ) , which holds only in the asymptotic region @xmath74 .",
    "taking into account the initial condition @xmath75 from equation  ( [ citi ] ) , one can obtain @xmath66 of a given node @xmath0 @xmath76 to obtain the average clustering coefficient @xmath77 of the whole network , the expression equation  ( [ cit1 ] ) has to be averaged over all nodes within a network .",
    "admittedly , it is difficult to find an exact analytic result of @xmath77 uniformly but we can give out numerical solutions of bbv networks by the definition @xmath78 in the figure  ( [ fig_avc ] ) , one can easily find out that both the numerical and theoretical results exhibit a power - law decay as the size of networks growing . hence ,",
    "when @xmath25 tends to infinity , @xmath77 is getting close to zero . as shown in the figure , the power - law exponent depends on the the tunable parameter @xmath35 . for large @xmath35 ,",
    "the decreasing velocity is relatively slow .",
    "[ 0.8 ] of a whole bbv network as a function of the network size @xmath25 for different values of the @xmath35 .",
    "results are obtained by numerical simulations on bbv networks ( averaged over 10 networks ) .",
    "the solid lines are numerical solutions given by equation  ( [ numc]).,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "to sum up , the clustering coefficient in complex systems is an important topological feature of complex systems .",
    "it has a profound impact on a variety of crucial fields , such as epidemic processes , network resilience and finding community structure , to name but a few . in this paper , we have derived analytically the solution for the clustering coefficient of the barrat et al.s model  @xcite which has been attracting much research interest .",
    "we found that the average clustering coefficient decays with the size of networks growing , following a power - law .",
    "our analytical technique could guide and shed light on related studies for weighted networks by providing a paradigm for calculating the clustering coefficient .",
