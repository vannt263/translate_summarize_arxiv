    "@xmath0 annihilation into hadrons is one of the most important suppliers of experimental information on the quark interactions . at high energy it serves as a test of perturbative qcd whereas at low energies it provides insight into nonperturbative effects in qcd as well as valuable input to various phenomenological models describing strongly interacting particles .",
    "it became conventional to use the dimensionless quantity @xmath1 to characterize the total cross section of @xmath2 hadrons :    [ eq : r ] r=(e^+e^-hadrons)/ ( e^+e^-^+^- ) .",
    "@xmath1 is widely used for various calculations .",
    "particularly , knowledge of @xmath1 with high accuracy is required for the evaluation of @xmath3 , the leading order hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath4 ( see @xcite and references therein ) or the value of the fine structure constant at the @xmath5 boson mass  @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 known today to better than 1.0 ppm is one of the best measured quantities in physics .",
    "the recently reported measurement of @xmath6 by the e821 collaboration at bnl @xcite and a possible deviation of its result from the predictions of standard model ( sm ) @xcite has generated numerous speculations ( for a review and discussion see  @xcite ) .",
    "+ within sm , the uncertainty of the theoretical value of the leading order @xmath6 is dominated by the uncertainty of the hadronic contribution that can be calculated via the dispersion integrals .",
    "[ eq : dint ] a_^had , lo = ( ) ^2 _ 4m_^2^ ds ,    where the qed kernel @xmath7 is a smooth function of energy varying from 0.63 at @xmath8 to 1 at @xmath9 .",
    "the precision of the @xmath3 calculation depends on the approach used and varies from 1.34 ppm based on @xmath0 data only @xcite to 0.53 ppm if in addition @xmath10-lepton decay data as well as perturbative qcd and qcd sum rules are extensively used @xcite . as it is clear from eq .",
    "[ eq : dint ] , the major contribution to its uncertainty comes from the systematic error of the @xmath1 measurement at low energies ( @xmath11 2 gev@xmath12 ) , which , in turn , is dominated by the systematic error of the measured cross section @xmath13 or pion form factor @xmath14 directly related to it .    assuming conservation of the vector current ( cvc ) and isospin symmetry , the spectral function of the @xmath15 decay , where x@xmath16 is a vector hadronic state with i=1 can be related to the corresponding isovector state x@xmath17 produced in @xmath0 annihilation @xcite .",
    "( here x can be @xmath18 ) .",
    "the detailed measurement of the spectral functions was provided by aleph @xcite , opal @xcite and cleo - ii @xcite .",
    "comparison of the hadronic cross sections measured at @xmath0 colliders with the spectral functions of the corresponding @xmath19 decays provides a test of cvc .",
    "if cvc holds with high accuracy , @xmath10-lepton decay data can be also used to substantially improve the accuracy of the calculations mentioned above @xcite .",
    "recent indications that the accuracy of cvc relations is not as good as believed for many years necessitates a careful reanalysis of such estimations  @xcite .",
    "thus , new high precision measurements of the cross section of @xmath20 and particularly of the pion form factor as well as precise determinations of the hadronic mass spectra in @xmath10 lepton decays become extremely important .",
    "since 1974 the @xmath0 collider vepp-2 m has been successfully running in the budker institute of nuclear physics in novosibirsk in the c.m.energy range from the threshold of hadron production to 1400 mev  @xcite .",
    "its maximum luminosity reached @xmath21 @xmath22s@xmath23 at the @xmath24 meson energy . in the last series of experiments two detectors ( cmd-2 and snd ) installed at vepp-2 m collected about 30 pb@xmath23 each .",
    "cmd-2 described in detail elsewhere @xcite is a general purpose detector . inside a superconducting solenoid with a field of 1 t",
    "there are a drift chamber and proportional z - chamber , both also used for the trigger , and an endcap bgo electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "outside there is a barrel csi electromagnetic calorimeter and muon streamer tube chambers .",
    "the main goal of cmd-2 is to perform a high precision measurement of the exclusive cross sections of various hadronic channels of @xmath0 annihilation and detailed studies of the low lying vector mesons - @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "snd described in detail elsewhere @xcite is a nonmagnetic detector with drift chambers for tracking and a three layer nai electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "outside it there are a muon streamer tube chamber and plastic scintillators .",
    "the main goal of snd is to study @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath24 decays as well as main hadronic channels .",
    "both experiments possess some special features making high precision measurements feasible :    * large data samples due to the high integrated luminosity and large acceptance * multiple scans of the same energy ranges to avoid possible systematic effects ; the step was 10 mev in the c.m.energy for the continuum region and 1 - 2 mev near the @xmath27 and @xmath24 peaks * the absolute calibration of the beam energy using the resonance depolarization method @xcite reduces to a negligible level a systematic error caused by an uncertainty in the energy measurement which can be significant for cross sections with strong energy dependence * good space and energy resolution lead to small background * redundancy - unstable particles are independently detected via different decay modes ( @xmath28 ; @xmath29 ) * detection efficiencies and calorimeter response are studied by using `` pure '' experimental data samples rather than monte carlo events , e.g. more than 20 million @xmath24 meson decays per detector can be used for that purpose .",
    "new results are available on most of the hadronic channels .",
    "the process @xmath13 is particularly important for various applications because of its large cross section at low energies .",
    "this reaction has been extensively studied before  @xcite .",
    "the most precise pion form factor data were obtained in late 70s ",
    "early 80s by cmd and olya detectors @xcite .",
    "their accuracy was limited by systematic errors of the experiments , varying from 2% to 15% over the vepp-2 m energy range . in the new measurement with the cmd-2 detector",
    "more than 2 million events of the process @xmath13 were detected from 370 to 1380 mev .",
    "below 600 mev separation of bhabha and @xmath30 events is performed by measuring their momentum . above this energy",
    "the energy deposition of the final particles in the calorimeter has been used .",
    "the number of events of the reaction @xmath31 was evaluated from qed which validity at these energies had been verified before .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of less than 0.6% was achieved in the final analysis of the data set of about 114000 events collected in the energy range 610 to 960 mev in 1994 - 1995 @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : syst ] lists the dominant sources of the systematic error .",
    "analysis is in progress for the rest of events and the expected systematic error ranges from 1% to 3% @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig : pipi ] shows results of the pion form factor measurement coming from cmd-2 .",
    ".main sources of systematic errors .",
    "[ tab : syst ] [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since e821 collaboration plans to improve the accuracy , it is clear that further progress is also needed from the theoretical side . at the present time",
    "the analysis of the @xmath32 data as well as other hadronic final states in the whole energy range accessible to cmd-2 is in progress .",
    "independent information is also expected in close future from other experiments studying low energy @xmath0 annihilation @xcite . when all the above mentioned data are taken into account",
    ", one can expect further improvement of the overall error of @xmath3 compared to the current one .",
    "it is very tempting to use an independent set of the @xmath10 lepton data to improve the existing evaluations of the hadronic effects .",
    "however , as we learned from the talk of a.  hcker at this workshop  @xcite , recent analysis revealed the apparent incompatibility of @xmath0 and @xmath10 lepton spectral functions  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath10 lepton based evaluation and the @xmath0 based one are hardly consistent , so that their averaging does nt improve the accuracy .",
    "more work is needed to clarify the reasons of this effect .",
    "thus , new experiments in novosibirsk and beijing considerably improved the accuracy of @xmath1 in the energy ranges below 1.38 gev and between 2 and 5 gev allowing significant improvement of the uncertainty of @xmath3 .",
    "precise tests of the relation between the @xmath0 cross sections and @xmath10 branching ratios will require better understanding of the isospin symmetry breaking effects and radiative corrections .",
    "together with the more detailed analysis of systematic effects in both @xmath0 and @xmath10 lepton sectors , it should allow to perform new precise evaluations of the hadronic corrections .",
    "further significant progress will become possible after new experiments planned at beijing , cornell and novosibirsk .",
    "also promising looks a possibility to study low energy @xmath0 annihilation by the radiative return from the @xmath33 or @xmath24 mesons @xcite .",
