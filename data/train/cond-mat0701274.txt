    "the absorption of circularly polarized light in semiconductor structures may lead to generation of an electric current which reverses its direction upon switching the light polarization from right - handed to left - handed and vice versa .",
    "such a circular photogalvanic effect ( cpge ) caused by asymmetry of elementary processes of photoexcitation requires structures of the appropriate symmetry .",
    "it is possible only in media which belong to one of the gyrotropic classes  @xcite .",
    "recently , cpge has attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "it was observed in low - dimensional structures : in zinc - blende- and diamond - type quantum wells ( qws ) , which are also belong to the gyrotropic media  @xcite .",
    "circular photocurrents were studied for a variety of optical ranges , including interband transitions in qws  @xcite , direct intersubband  @xcite and indirect intrasubband ( drude - like )  @xcite transitions in @xmath0-doped qw structures .",
    "so far , the microscopic theory of cpge in zinc - blende - type structures has been developed for the direct interband or intersubband optical transitions .",
    "it has been shown that the effect originates from the complicated band structure of the semiconductor compounds , mostly , from spin - orbit splitting of the electron or hole states , which is odd in the wave vector @xmath1  @xcite , and linear - in-@xmath1 terms in the matrix elements of interband optical transitions  @xcite . here",
    "we address cpge caused by the free - carrier absorption of circularly polarized radiation in @xmath0-doped qw structures .",
    "we show that a pure orbital mechanism of the effect can predominate in this spectral range , which is related to neither spin - orbit coupling nor spin - sensitive selection rules for the optical transitions .",
    "this mechanism is based on interference of different pathways contributing to the light absorption . a similar cpge model for the optical transitions between quantum subbands",
    "was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the orbital mechanism is especially efficient for the free - carrier absorption , which is contributed by indirect optical transitions .",
    "we consider cpge in ( 001)-oriented qws grown from zinc - blende - type semiconductors .",

    "phenomenologically , the constant @xmath3 is related to the heterostructure asymmetry , i.e. , nonequivalence of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions , while the constant @xmath4 originates from lack of an inversion center in the host crystal .    at normal incidence of the light",

    "( [ j_phenom ] ) .    below we present a microscopic theory for the orbital mechanism of cpge and show that this mechanism contributes to @xmath3 as well as @xmath4 and @xmath21 constants .",
    "the free - carrier absorption of radiation is always accompanied by electron scattering from static defects , acoustic or optical phonons , etc . , because of the need for energy and momentum conservation .",
    "such indirect optical transitions are treated as second - order processes , which involve electron - photon interaction and electron scattering , via virtual intermediate states .",
    "the intermediate states can be those within the same quantum subband , @xmath22 in our case , or in other conduction or valence subbands .",
    "the dominant pathway determining the qw absorbance involve intermediate states within the subband @xmath22 ( see fig .  1 ) .",

    "the helicity dependent photocurrent arises if one takes into account interference of the processes depicted in fig .  1 and those with virtual intermediate states in other subbands .",
    "the quantum subband , which is the closest to @xmath22 , is the electron subband @xmath33 .",
    "optical transitions with intermediate states in the subband @xmath33 contributing to the free - carrier absorption are sketched in fig .  2 .",

    "it vanishes for the linearly polarized light and is proportional to the light helicity @xmath9 for the elliptical or circular polarization , because @xmath48=\\mathbf{l}p_{circ}$ ] .",
    "thus , the sign of the interference term is determined by the light helicity , and the photocurrent reverses its direction by changing the light polarization from right - handed to left - handed and vice versa .",
    "physically , the orbital mechanism of the circular photogalvanic effect can also be interpreted as follows . under excitation with circularly polarized light the processes depicted in fig .  1 and fig .",
    "2 are added constructively for transitions to positive @xmath49 ( or negative @xmath49 , depending on the light helicity ) and destructively for transitions to @xmath50 .",
    "it means that the transition rates to the states @xmath49 and @xmath50 are different , resulting in an electric current of the photoexcited carriers .",
    "direction of the photocurrent with respect to the crystallographic axes is determined by the light polarization and the explicit form of the matrix elements of intrasubband and intersubband scattering .",
    "the matrix element  ( [ me2 ] ) is proportional to out - of - plane component of the polarization vector .",
    "therefore , the term caused by interference of the optical processes via the subband @xmath22 and @xmath33 can contribute to cpge at oblique incidence only .",
    "we consider the effect for @xmath51-grown quantum wells . in such structures electron scattering by static defects , acoustic or optical phonons",
    "is usually treated as central . under this assumption",
    "the matrix elements of intrasubband and intersubband scattering , @xmath32 and @xmath40 , respectively , take no account of the lattice symmetry of the host semiconductor and depend on @xmath52 only .",
    "then , the helicity dependent photocurrent flows in the direction perpendicular to the light incidence plane .",
    "this contribution corresponds to the terms described by the phenomenological constant @xmath3 in eq .",

    "we note that both the absorbance @xmath56 and the momentum relaxation time @xmath57 are governed by the matrix element of intrasubband scattering @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the product @xmath58 is independent of the scattering rate . for quasi - elastic scattering from acoustic phonons or short - range static defects ,",
    "the product is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath61 is the carrier density , and @xmath62 is a parameter depending on the carrier distribution .",

    "electron - phonon interaction predominates over the electron scattering by static defects . in the case of quasi - elastic scattering from acoustic phonons",
    "the parameter @xmath55 is also given by eq .",
    "( [ xi ] ) where @xmath74 is set to be a constant .    in accordance with general symmetry arguments ,",
    "the helicity dependent photocurrent corresponding to the phenomenological constant @xmath3 is related to inversion asymmetry of the heterostructure .",
    "this follows also from eqs .",
    "( [ gamma1 ] ) and ( [ xi ] ) , which demonstrate that the sign and magnitude of @xmath3 is determined by asymmetry of the confinement potential and the doping profile .",
    "in particular , @xmath75 for the absolutely symmetrical structures , where @xmath74 and @xmath76 are even functions while @xmath77 is an odd function with respect to the qw center .      to obtain the circular photocurrents described by the phenomenological constants @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ j_phenom ] ) and @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ j_110 ] ) one has to take into account the lattice symmetry of the qw host semiconductor .",
    "this can be done considering interference of optical transitions with intermediate states in the subband @xmath22 and those via the valence - band states .    to calculate this contribution to cpge we neglect spin - orbit splitting of the valence band for simplicity and assume that the effective hole masses in the qw plane are larger than the effective electron mass .",

    "the interband constant @xmath86 originates from lack of an inversion symmetry in zinc - blende - type crystals ( @xmath90 point group ) and vanishes in centrosymmetric semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "calculation shows that in ( 001)-oriented qws the matrix element @xmath91 contains a term proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "interference of this term and @xmath93 gives rise to the circular photocurrent described by @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ j_phenom ] ) . for the free - carrier absorption assisted by quasi - elastic scattering from acoustic phonons",
    "the constant @xmath4 has the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the intraband deformation - potential constant , which determines the light absorbance @xmath56 , and @xmath96 is a parameter depending on the qw width , the carrier distribution and the photon energy . for a rectangular quantum well with the infinitely high barriers , @xmath97 if the photon energy is much less than the mean electron energy and @xmath98 in the opposite limiting case . here @xmath99 is the mean value of @xmath100 ( @xmath101 for a degenerate two - dimensional gas and @xmath102 for a non - degenerate two - dimensional gas , where @xmath103 is the fermi wave vector ) , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is the qw width .    in ( 110)-oriented qws interference of the optical transitions with intermediate states in the subband @xmath22 and in the valence band",
    "leads to the helicity dependent photocurrent even at normal incidence of the light .",
    "calculation shows that for this particular mechanism the constant @xmath21 has the form @xmath106 it is independent of the qw width and is determined solely by the carrier density , the scattering mechanism and the band parameters .",
    "as is mentioned above , the phenomenological constants @xmath4 and @xmath21 are related to lack of an inversion asymmetry in the bulk semiconductor rather than to the structure asymmetry .",
    "this follows also from eqs .",
    "( [ gamma2 ] ) and ( [ gamma3 ] ) , which show that both @xmath4 and @xmath21 do not vanish even in symmetrical qws grown from zinc - blende - type compounds .",
    "another orbital contribution to @xmath4 can originate from interference of the processes via the subbands @xmath22 and @xmath33 ( depicted in figs .  1 and 2 , respectively ) in the presence of scattering anisotropy .",
    "indeed , the @xmath90 point group of zinc - blende - type semiconductors does not contain the space inversion and allows for an antisymmetric term in the matrix element of scattering , which changes the sign upon the replacement @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "such an anisotropy in scattering can be modeled , e.g. , by impurity potential of the form  @xcite @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the impurity position .",
    "the antisymmetric part of the impurity potential does not violate inherent isotropy of electrical properties of bulk cubic materials and , therefore , can not be easily detected  @xcite .",
    "however , in ( 001)-oriented qws it adds a term to the matrix element of electron scattering , which is proportional to @xmath111 and , therefore , contributes to @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the impurity range is much shorter than the qw width and the inequality @xmath112 is fulfilled .",

    "we have shown that the free - carrier absorption of circularly polarized radiation in quantum well structures leads to an electric current , which reverses its direction upon switching the light helicity .",
    "the proposed pure orbital mechanism of the circular photogalvanic effect is based on interference of different pathways contributing to the light absorption and does not involve spin of free carriers .    in qw structures grown along [ 110 ] or [ 113 ] crystallographic direction the circular photocurrent can be excited at normal incidence of the radiation . following eqs .",
    "( [ j_110 ] ) and ( [ gamma3 ] ) we can estimate the magnitude of the circular photocurrent density .",

    "in ( 001)-oriented qws the helicity dependent photocurrent can be induced at oblique incidence of the radiation only , and the current magnitude varies in a wide range depending on the qw width and asymmetry .",
    "equations  ( [ j_phenom ] ) and ( [ gamma1 ] ) give @xmath132a / cm for a qw of the width @xmath133 , the asymmetry degree @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and the photon energy , the light intensity and the carrier density presented above .",
    "the estimated magnitude of the photocurrent corresponds to that measured in experiments on ( 001)-oriented structures  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the orbital mechanism , a contribution to cpge in quantum wells structures may come from @xmath1-linear spin - orbit splitting of the quantum subbands together with the spin - sensitive selection rules for the optical transitions .",
    "however , estimations show that the spin contribution to the circular photocurrent induced by the free - carrier absorption in @xmath0-doped structures vanishes to the first order in spin - orbit interaction and , therefore , is considerably smaller than the orbital term .",
    "additional experiments , such as measurements of the frequency and temperature dependencies of the photocurrent , can be useful in establishing the roles of the orbital and spin - related mechanisms of cpge more reliable . in particular , the ratio @xmath136 is expected to be independent of the photon energy @xmath137 for the spin - related mechanism , while it does depend on @xmath137 for the orbital mechanism provided @xmath138 .",
    "besides , increase of the temperature from liquid helium to the room temperature leads to changing the dominant scattering mechanism .",
    "it can strongly affect the orbital contribution to cpge , which is inherently related to details of scattering .",
