    "cells are subjected to a transient stretch such that , after some additional waiting time in the unstretched state , the ( linear ) material properties of the initial state are recovered . the simplification for the theoretical modelling results from the assumption that not only the macro - state but also the micro - state of the system may to a good approximation be treated as reversible under such conditions ; i.e.",
    ", we assume that the complete conformation of the polymer network , including the transiently broken bonds between adjacent polymers , is constrained to eventually return to its original equilibrium state . for the time - delayed hysteretic response of the network to such protocols one could thus still speak of a viscoelastic ( `` anelastic '' ) response in an operational sense , but we refrain from doing so in view of the fundamentally inelastic nature of the underlying stochastic process  in contrast to the reversible softening effects observed in @xcite , for example .",

    "the individual modes labelled by an index @xmath0 are independent of each other and decay exponentially with rates @xmath1 . for convenience ,",
    "we set the thermal energy @xmath2 , so that the bending rigidity can be identified with the persistence length @xmath3 , in the following . using this convention ,",
    "the  expression for the transverse susceptibility of a polymer of contour length @xmath4 ( with respect to a point force ) reads @xcite @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is an optional backbone tension , and @xmath7 the euler buckling force for a hinged rod of length @xmath4 .",
    "the different powers of @xmath0 in the denominator give notice of the competition of bending and stretching forces .",
    "in the , interactions of the polymer with the surrounding network ( e.g.  excluded volume interactions or sticky contacts ) are reflected in an altered  mode relaxation spectrum @xcite . the intuitive  albeit not fully microscopic  picture underlying the formulation of the  is illustrated in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] , which depicts a test polymer reversibly bound to the background network _ via _ potential wells at all topological contacts , the so - called entanglement points .",

    "an approximate expression for the macroscopic shear modulus is obtained along similar lines @xcite .    in the original equilibrium  theory , @xmath9 was assumed to be a constant on the order of the entanglement length of the network , @xmath16 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath17 is a geometric quantity ( which is determined by the polymer concentration and the persistence length ) while the contour length @xmath9 between closed bonds clearly depends on the state of the bond network .",
    "one therefore has to allow for an increase of @xmath9 with the number of broken bonds in non - equilibrium applications .",
    "this issue is explored in the following .",
    "all mechanical quantities calculated within the  model crucially depend on the interaction length @xmath9 . in previous applications of the model @xcite it was assumed that @xmath9 remains constant  equal to its equilibrium value and unaffected by the deformation of the sample . in other words ,",
    "the equilibrium theory allowed for statistical bond fluctuations but not for a dynamical evolution of the parameters characterizing the thermodynamic state of the bond network .",
    "an obvious starting point for generalizations of the model to non - equilibrium situations is therefore to consider the number of closed bonds , and therefore also @xmath9 , as _ dynamic variables _ , dependent on the strain- and stress - history of the network .",
    "we now provide a mean - field description to account for such a dynamically evolving bond network . for clarity , we return to the intuitive picture underlying the where the ( possibly crosslinker- or molecular - motor - mediated ) complex interactions between the polymers are summarized into an effective interaction potential for a test segment against the background , as sketched in figure [ fig : potential ] .",
    "the same idea has also been used before in many related situations ( e.g.@xcite ) .     between both states .",
    "the transition rates @xmath18 and @xmath19 between the bound and unbound state depend on the barrier heights @xmath12 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "an externally applied force can tilt the potential and favour binding or unbinding events.,width=9 ]    the generic potential exhibits three essential features : a well - defined bound state , a well - defined unbound state , and a barrier in between ( figure [ fig : potential ] ) .",
    "the confining well corresponding to the unbound state represents the tube - like caging of the test polymer within the surrounding network @xcite .",
    "for ease of notation , we further introduce the dimensionless fraction of closed bonds or , _ bond fraction _",
    "@xmath21 which is simply the ensemble - averaged fraction of sticky contacts that are actually in the bound state .",
    "the minimum bond distance @xmath22 is typically on the order of @xmath17 , but may be somewhat larger in situations where the bonds are mediated by crosslinker molecules or by partially sterically inaccessible sticky patches ( as e.g.  for helical molecules @xcite ) .    a quantitatively fully consistent way of calculating the dynamics of @xmath23 would involve solving the full fokker - planck equation for a -contact  a formidable program to be pursued elsewhere @xcite . here ,",
    "for the sake of our qualitative purposes , we chose to concentrate onto the physical essence of the discussion , and keep the mathematical structure as simple and transparent as possible .",
    "we therefore approximate the dynamics by a simple exponential relaxation as familiar from the standard example of reacting brownian particles , conventionally described by kramers theory with a bell - like force dependence @xcite . using this simplification and assuming a schematic interaction potential as depicted in figure  [ fig : potential ] , the value of @xmath23 is determined by a competition of bond breaking and bond formation with reaction rates @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "both rates are represented in the usual adiabatic approximation ( meaning that the equilibration _ inside _ the wells is much faster than the barrier crossing and external perturbations ) by @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an intrinsic characteristic brownian time scale for bond breaking and formation and @xmath26 are characterized by different brownian time scales depending on the width of the potential wells . at the present stage , we do not bother to distinguish these time scales nor to fine - tune their numerical values , and identify them , for the sake of simplicity , with the entanglement time scale @xmath27 in our numerical calculations .",
    "] , and @xmath6 is the force pulling on the bond . noting that the fraction of open bonds is @xmath28 , we can then write down the following rate equation for the fraction of closed bonds @xmath29 the time dependence of @xmath30 leads via ( [ eq : nu_lambda ] ) to an implicit time dependence of the -parameter @xmath31 and thereby of all observables derived from the .",
    "the time - dependent force @xmath32 in ( [ eq : rate ] ) may be thought to result from an externally imposed stress protocol or from internal dynamical elements such as molecular motors setting the network under dynamic stress .",
    "hence , via an appropriately chosen set of slowly changing state parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ,   the model can in principle accommodate for the active biological remodelling in living cells and tissues @xcite .",

    "strong perturbations ( stress or strain ) then give rise to a pronounced stiffening due to the steeply nonlinear response of semiflexible polymers under elongation @xcite .",
    "this well established behaviour can be understood as the canvas against which we aim to discern the characteristic mechanical signatures of the bond kinetics .",
    "an observable that will be of particular interest in the following is the complex microscopic `` modulus '' @xmath48 , introduced in the previous section .",

    "it is instructive to first examine the dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath23 . to this end , we formally consider @xmath23 temporarily as an independent variable instead of determining it from ( [ eq : rate ] ) .",
    "note that this approach nevertheless makes sense as for a fixed set of parameters , @xmath23 can still take any value between zero and one .",
    "this is due to the freedom of choosing an initial state , which can be imagined to have evolved from the prior deformation history .    for fixed other parameters , both the real part @xmath46 ( figure [ fig : mod_lam]a ) and the imaginary part @xmath50 of @xmath49 increase monotonically with @xmath23 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath50 is not simply proportional to @xmath46 and therefore the loss angle @xmath51 also depends on @xmath23 ( figure [ fig : mod_lam]b ) . for small @xmath23 , the loss angle is large , corresponding to fluid - like behaviour . with increasing @xmath23 ,",
    "the system becomes more solid - like .",
    "increasing the barrier height @xmath12 makes the dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath23 more pronounced ( figure [ fig : mod_lam ] ) .",
    "conversely , as can be expected , the dependence on the barrier height @xmath12 vanishes with decreasing bond fraction @xmath23 .",
    "note that due to the boundary conditions the limit of a newtonian fluid ( @xmath52 ) is not recovered when formally taking the limit of vanishing bond fraction ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) .",

    "after these general considerations , we now concentrate on the nonlinear and non - equilibrium dynamic response of the extended inelastic  model , which results from the coupled relaxation of the viscoelastic polymer network _ and _ the transient bond network .      a convenient way to characterize the mechanical properties of an inelastic material is a force - displacement curve . for a perfectly linear elastic ( hookean ) body , it would simply consist of a straight line , whereas a perfectly plastic body would feature as a rectangle delineated by a yield force @xmath56 and an arbitrary plastic strain value . for our qualitative purpose",

    "they can be mostly eliminated by using force ramp protocols of various slopes instead of the gaussian displacement pulses . for not too low rates ,",

    "the minimum bond fraction reached during the application of the pulse , which we interpret as a measure of the degree of fluidization , depends _ non - monotonically _ on the rate ( figure [ fig : force_displacement]d , inset ) .",

    "this is clearly a mean - field assumption .",
    "recent combined experimental and theoretical studies have established that the local tube diameter and entanglement length in pure semiflexible polymer solutions actually exhibit a skewed leptocurtic distribution with broad tails @xcite . to include this information in the above analysis is not straightforward , since the elastic interactions between regions of different entanglement length are not known , _ a priori_. for the sake of a first qualitative estimate , the simplest procedure seems to be to average the above results over a distribution of @xmath22 , corresponding to a parallel connection of independent entanglement elements .",

    "moreover , the initial stiffening is slightly more pronounced .",
    "this is due to the contributions of @xmath95 , which exhibit both stronger stiffening and fluidization",
    ". nevertheless , all qualitative features  like stiffening and remodelling effects and a `` flow state '' indicating fluidization or inelastic shakedown  can still be well discerned .",
    "this is consistent with the assumption that pure semiflexible polymer solutions are at least qualitatively well described by a single entanglement length @xcite .",
    "we have presented a theoretical framework for a polymer - based description of the inelastic nonlinear mechanical behaviour of sticky biopolymer networks .",
    "we represented the polymer network on a mean - field level by a test polymer described by the phenomenologically highly successful  model . beyond the equilibrium statistical fluctuations captured by the original model",
    ", we additionally allowed for a dynamically evolving thermodynamic state variable @xmath31 characterizing the network of thermo - reversible sticky bonds , which is updated dynamically upon bond breaking according to an appropriate rate equation . within our approximate treatment",
    "we could obtain a number of robust and qualitatively interesting results , which are not sensitive to the precise parameter values chosen , nor to the choice of the transverse rather than the longitudinal susceptibility in ( [ eq : sus_wlc ] ) .",
    "for sufficiently strong deformations , changes in the mean fraction of closed bonds , reflected in @xmath31 , can influence material properties to a degree at which the material behaves qualitatively different from the usual viscoelastic paradigm .",
    "in particular , our theory predicts a pronounced fluidization response , which develops upon strong deformations on top of the intrinsic viscoelastic stiffening response provided by the individual polymers .",
    "after cessation of loading , the system slowly recovers its initial state .",
    "these observations are in qualitative agreement with recently published experimental results obtained for living cells @xcite , and a more quantitative comparison with dedicated measurement results for cells and _ in vitro _",
    "biopolymer networks will be the subject of future work .",
    "we found the yield force for the onset of the fluidization to be sensitive to the deformation rate .",
    "moreover , the fluidization response was shown to be accompanied by a cyclic softening or shake - down effect .",
    "taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of biopolymer solutions by a distribution of entanglement lengths leads to a smoothing of the force - displacement curves without affecting their qualitative characteristics .",
    "one may still expect qualitatively new effects in situations with unusually broad distributions of entanglement lengths , such as for strongly heterogeneous ( e.g.  phase separating ) networks .",
    "a parameter that was found to be very important for cells @xcite but has not been discussed much in this contribution is the _ prestressing force _",
    "@xmath96 ( see appendix [ sec : technical ] ) , which is present in adhering cells even in the absence of external driving . experimentally , it was established that increasing prestress is correlated with a higher stiffness of adhering cells @xcite which in turn is correlated with a higher stiffness of the substrate @xcite .",
    "when naively treating the prestressing force just as an additive contribution to the overall force , our model predicts the opposite : the additional force breaks more bonds and the network becomes softer and more fluid - like . to reconcile these apparently contradicting trends , one can appeal to the notion of _ homeostasis _ , which essentially amounts to postulating that the cell actively adapts its structure such that a certain set of thermodynamic state variables remain in a physiologically sensible range @xcite .",
    "this basically implies that the cell will respond to stiff substrates or persistent external stresses by a biological remodelling that corresponds to an increase of @xmath12 and @xmath55 , and possibly to a decrease of @xmath22 . by adapting also the internal prestress @xmath96 ,",
    "the cell may then avoid , apart from the structural collapse , an equally undesirable loss of flexibility .",
    "we note , however , that internal stresses are indeed observed to disrupt the cytoskeleton , as implied by the simple physical theory presented here , if they are not permanently balanced by a substrate @xcite .",
    "even though the nonlinear effects presented in this contribution depend crucially on the bond kinetics , it should not be overlooked that the  is an equally indispensable ingredient of the complete theory .",
    "first , it provides the constitutive relation that gives the force in response to an infinitesimal displacement , which in turn governs the bond kinetics .",
    "secondly , the time - dependent linear susceptibility strongly filters the dynamic remodelling of the bond network in practical applications , in which one rarely has access to the microstate of the underlying bond network . in summary ,",
    "the extended model thus integrates experimentally confirmed features of the  response such as slow relaxation , power - law rheology , viscoelastic hysteresis , and shear stiffening with a simple bond kinetics scheme , which allows less intuitive complex nonlinear physical remodelling effects like fluidization and inelastic shake - down to be addressed .",
    "finally , we want to point out that it is straightforward to extend the above analysis in a natural way to account for irreversible plastic deformations @xcite . to this end",
    ", one has to allow for the possibility that the transiently broken bonds reform somewhere else than at their original sites ( as always assumed in the foregoing discussion ) after strong deformations with finite residual displacement",
    ". this can be included by accommodating an additional term acting as a `` slip rate '' in ( [ eq : rate ] ) @xcite .",
    "we acknowledge many fruitful discussions with j.  glaser , s.  sturm , and k.  hallatschek , and financial support from the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) through for 877 and , within the german excellence initiative , the leipzig school of natural sciences  building with molecules and nano - objects .",
    "the deformation pulse protocol used in this paper is @xmath97 to obtain the full nonlinear response of the ( extended )  to the displacement protocol ( [ eq : strain_gauss ] ) , we make use of the superposition principle : we know that the fourier transform of @xmath98 is the linear response to a small displacement step .",
    "after decomposing a finite displacement into infinitesimal displacement steps and a partial integration , we write @xmath99 note that the right hand side of ( [ eq : force ] ) depends on @xmath100 , rendering it a highly nonlinear implicit equation . using ( [ eq : strain_gauss ] ) and integrating by parts , we obtain @xmath101    the next step is to identify a connection between the force in ( [ eq : rate ] ) and @xmath102(t ) .",
    "a finite prestressing force @xmath96 is introduced mainly for technical reasons , namely to avoid the unphysical region of negative ( i.e.  compressive ) backbone stress , which would buckle the polymers .",
    "while the physics of the prestressed network can essentially be mapped back to that of a network without prestress by a renormalization of the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath55 , prestress may also be seen as an important feature : indeed , the cytoskeleton of adhered cells is well known to be under permanent prestress , and suspended cells seem prone to spontaneous shape oscillations that could be indicative of a propensity of the cells to set themselves under prestress @xcite . in the context and on the longer time scales of the biological remodelling of the cytoskeleton",
    "it would therefore make sense to think of @xmath96 as a dynamic force generated by molecular motors and polymerization forces . for the following , however , we take the prestress to be constant so that the force entering ( [ eq : rate ] ) is @xmath103 we now face the problem that ( [ eq : force ] ) is an implicit equation for @xmath100 , which depends on @xmath30 , which in turn depends via @xmath32 on @xmath104 .",
    "we therefore use a two - step euler scheme : as initial values for @xmath6 and @xmath23 , we choose the prestressing force , @xmath105 , and the steady - state value under the prestressing force , @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "we then choose a sufficiently small time step @xmath107 and apply the following iterative rule : @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "in the limit @xmath110 , this procedure converges to the exact solution .",
