    "in wireless networks , the introduction of relaying provides higher link reliability when the source - destination link suffers severe fading . among different cooperative strategies , the fixed ( af ) and the selective ( df )",
    "cooperative techniques are often employed in cooperative networks . in the fixed af",
    ", the relay does nt perform decoding on received signals and always forwards the amplified received signals to the destination .",
    "the selective df model differs from the fixed af in that it will perform decode - and - forward only if its received signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath1 from the source is greater than a threshold @xmath2 . by comparison ,",
    "the fixed af is easy to implement while the selective df may be more complicated on hardware but performs better in terms of bandwidth efficiency . in this paper",
    ", we consider both models and propose maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) and non - mrc decoding at the destination and analyze their energy efficiencies .    several previous studies in which energy or power efficiency of cooperative transmissions is considered either opt to minimize the total power when constrained by a given system outage probability , or maximize the network lifetime with some instantaneous power constraints @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , specific modulations schemes or link layer retransmissions have not been considered and incorporated in the analysis in such studies .",
    "since the modulation size affects the transmission rate and consequently the transmission time , it certainly has a significant impact on the total energy consumption .",
    "when modulation schemes are explicitly considered , power consumption normalized by the transmission rate , i.e. , energy per bit , rather than total power consumption should be used in order to provide fair comparison between different modulation schemes .",
    "in addition , energy expended in retransmissions , together with circuit energy consumption , should be included in the energy efficiency analysis for more accurate results .    in this paper , motivated by these considerations ,",
    "we investigate the energy efficiency of cooperative transmissions by jointly considering transmission , circuit , and retransmission energies , and analyzing the bit energy levels achieved by different mqam schemes . in the system model",
    ", we assume a rayleigh fading channel , through which the source sends information packets to the destination and relay by broadcasting .",
    "constrained by a given ber requirement , we derive the system outage probability .",
    "the relay is assumed to assist the transmission to the destination in either the af or df modes , with or without mrc .",
    "different mqam sizes are investigated to find the optimal constellation size in terms of minimum bit energy consumption .",
    "we assume a 3-node cooperative network ,    where the source has a certain number of bits to transmit to the destination . while the relay is initially assumed to be located in the middle between the source and destination , the performance at different locations are analyzed subsequently .",
    "the broadcast from the source can be heard by the relay and destination .",
    "when the destination successfully receives the signals either from the source or from the relay s cooperative transmission , it sends acknowledgement back to the source to indicate a successful transmission . otherwise , the source will retransmit until a successful packet delivery is achieved at the destination .",
    "we assume 3 independent rayleigh fading channels for the source - destination ( s - d ) link , the source - relay ( s - r ) link and the relay - destination ( r - d ) link .",
    "moreover , white gaussian noise with zero mean and variance @xmath3 is assumed to be added to the received signals at receivers .",
    "figure [ fig:3-node - model ] shows the system model .",
    "the introduction of a relay node definitely adds more energy overhead and system complexity , but it creates more reliability from the auxiliary r - d link when s - d channel fails . if we assume the signal transmitted from the source is @xmath4 with unit energy and gets broadcasted through the combined path loss and rayleigh fading channels , the received signals at the relay and destination can be represented by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the transmit power of the source . in the above formulation , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the path loss components as functions of the s - d distance @xmath9 , the s - r distance @xmath10 and the path loss exponent @xmath11 . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are channel fading coefficients between s - r and s - d , respectively , modeled as zero - mean circularly symmetric gaussian complex random variables . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the additive gaussian noise at the destination and relay , respectively .",
    "we adopt the accurate energy consumption formulation from @xcite , by assuming the source has @xmath16 bits to transmit directly to the destination .",
    "such a single transmission consists of 2 distinct periods : transmission period @xmath17 and transient period @xmath18 .",
    "accordingly , the total energy required to send 1 bit is represented by @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "specifically , @xmath21 comprises the transmit power @xmath6 , the amplifier power @xmath22 , the circuit power @xmath23 at the source transmitter and @xmath24 at the destination receiver and the transient power @xmath25 .",
    "we consider uncoded square mqam as our modulation and have @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the constellation size defined as @xmath28 in mqam , and @xmath29 is the symbol duration approximated by @xmath30 .",
    "finally , the amplifier efficiency for mqam can be obtained from @xmath31 where @xmath32 in @xcite .      in our model",
    ", qos is constrained by a given ber on each transmission link and @xmath6 is specified . in an uncoded square mqam",
    ", we can derive the snr @xmath33 according to a given @xmath34 in the awgn channel , according to ( [ eq : mqamprob ] ) below : @xmath35 the snr threshold in our model is therefore derived as @xmath36 with @xmath2 , we can compute the system outage probability in the following sections .",
    "in fixed af , network can have 2 different states : in state 1 , the source broadcasts the signal @xmath4 and the received signals at the relay and destination can be represented by ( [ eq : ysr ] ) and ( [ eq : ysd ] ) . at the end of state 1 , the destination will first attempt to decode @xmath37 to see if it has been received correctly ; otherwise the network will initiate state 2 in which the relay helps to forward @xmath38 to the destination by scaling it with @xmath39 @xmath40 and then transmitting this scaled signal with power @xmath6 to the destination .",
    "so , the received signal from the relay at the destination is @xmath41 the noise term in ( [ eq : yrd ] ) is @xmath42 with variance @xmath43      we first study the fixed af without mrc , where the destination only utilizes @xmath44 from the relay for decoding if the s - d link has failed .",
    "after state 2 , if the destination still fails to correctly receive the signal , it then notifies the source to schedule a retransmission , and this repeats until a successful signal delivery is achieved at the destination .",
    "the successful signal reception statistically depends on the outage probability of the direct s - d link and the cooperative s - r - d link .",
    "if we assume @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are exponentially distributed with unit mean , then @xmath48 , which is defined as , @xmath49 has an exponential distribution with cumulative density function ( cdf ) evaluated at @xmath2 given by @xmath50 the received snr @xmath51 at the destination from the relay is more complicated and represented by @xmath52 and its cdf is formulated as ( see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the first order modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "the system success probability is therefore derived as @xmath56 with @xmath2 derived in section ii , the number of retransmissions is a geometric random variable and has a mean of @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "we then formulate the system average power consumption from @xmath58 where the power in the first term corresponds to the total consumption in state 1 where the s - d link is not in outage ; the second term corresponds to both state 1 and state 2 when s - d link is in outage and the relay participates to transmit the received signal to the destination .",
    "considering retransmission , the average bit energy consumption is @xmath59 to measure how much energy efficiency can be achieved from cooperative transmission , we define the cooperative gain as @xmath60 where @xmath61      the fixed af with mrc differs from the non - mrc scheme only in state 2 : if the s - d link fails , the relay will amplify and forward its received signal to the destination and we suppose the destination employs a coherent detector which knows all channel fading coefficients @xmath13 , @xmath12 and @xmath62 , such that both @xmath48 and @xmath51 will be combined with mrc techniques to output the maximized equivalent snr @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath48 and @xmath51 have been derived at ( [ eq : gamma - sd ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma - rd ] ) .",
    "if the destination still fails to correctly receive the signal in state 2 , retransmission will be initiated until a successful signal delivery at the destination . therefore , this system has a success probability given by @xmath65 the cdf of @xmath51 conditioned on @xmath48 is @xmath66 where @xmath67 then , we average it over @xmath48 and derive @xmath68 where @xmath69    we can similarly calculate the average bit energy consumption @xmath70 and the cooperative @xmath71 in the fixed af with mrc similarly as in ( [ eq : ea1 ] ) and ( [ eq : gain1 ] ) in the af without mrc .      by using the parameters provided in table [ table : minbitenergy ] @xcite , @xcite , @xcite",
    ", we perform numerical computations on the above two models .",
    "the results are shown in the following figures , with solid - line curves corresponding to the mrc model and broken - line curves corresponding to the non - mrc model .",
    ".network and circuit parameters [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     first in fig .",
    "[ fig : af - bit ] , we vary the constellation size @xmath72 $ ] at a specific s - d distance @xmath73 $ ] to see how bit energy consumption changes .",
    "we immediately observe the following . at relatively large s - d distances in either mrc or non - mrc models , the bit energy increases as @xmath27",
    "gets either large or very small , and hence , there exists an optimal @xmath27 that minimizes the bit energy .",
    "we have the following tradeoff .",
    "an mqam with large @xmath27 transmits signals at a faster rate and consequently decreases @xmath17 and hence the energy consumption in a single transmission , but it also requires a higher @xmath2 , leading to higher outage probability and as a result more energy from retransmissions .",
    "a small constellation size requires more energy in a single transmission , but less retransmissions .",
    "hence , the optimal constellation size exists to provide a balance between these effects .",
    "we also observe at any s - d distance that both models achieve the same optimal @xmath27 and the energy - minimizing constellation size gets smaller with increasing s - d distance .",
    "however , at small distances such as 5 m and 25 m , whatever the constellation size is , the link reliability is always very high .",
    "so , large constellation size is always preferred because it consumes less energy in a single transmission .",
    "it is immediately seen , as expected , that the mrc model outperforms the non - mrc model especially at large @xmath27 and s - d distances .",
    "however , at small distances , these 2 models achieve almost the same performance . in such cases , simpler non - mrc techniques can be preferred .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : af - distance ] , the bit energy is plotted as a function of s - d distance at a specific @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "we see that while large constellation sizes are performing well at small distances , small constellations should be preferred when the distance gets large .",
    "again , the mrc model outperforms the non - mrc model in terms of lower bit energy consumption .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : af - distance - gain ] in which cooperative gain is plotted , the mrc model again achieves higher gains .",
    "we also see when @xmath74 , the direct transmission is almost always more energy efficient than the cooperative transmission .",
    "but , the cooperative transmission starts outperforming the direct transmission at @xmath75 when @xmath76 and at @xmath77 when @xmath78 .",
    "this is because at small distances , cooperation of the relay will increase the energy overhead , counteracting its energy saving from added reliability and making it less efficient . on the other hand , at larger @xmath27 and distances , the energy saving from less number of retransmissions by improved reliability dominates so that the system achieves very high cooperative gains .",
    "now , we fix @xmath77 and move the location of the relay either closer to the source or closer to the destination , indicated by a normalized location index from 0.1 to 0.9 , where 0.5 means the relay is located right in the middle , in order to see the impact on cooperative gain . in fig . [",
    "fig : af - location - gain ] , when the s - d distance is 25 m , both non - mrc and mrc achieve the same gain , almost always less than 1 . at higher transmission distances such as 75 m and 100 m , very high gains",
    "show that the system significantly benefits from the cooperative transmission and mrc always outperforms non - mrc .",
    "also , we observe that the maximal cooperative gain is achieved when the relay is located in exactly the middle of the source and the destination .",
    "in selective df , the relay performs decode - and - forward only if @xmath79 while @xmath80 .",
    "so , there are 4 mutually exclusive working states in the df : 1 .",
    "s - d link successful ; 2 . both s - d link and s - r link in outage ; 3 .",
    "s - d link in outage , but s - r and r - d links successful ; 4 .",
    "s - d link and r - d in outage , but s - r link successful .",
    "according to the above 4 different states , the system average power consumption can be formulated as @xmath81 the system success probability is defined as @xmath82 which can be calculated according to the following cdfs of exponential distribution @xmath83",
    "@xmath84 @xmath85 hence , the bit energy consumption in this model is @xmath86 and the cooperative gain is @xmath87      in this model , since we assume the destination employs a coherent detector , mrc will output a combined @xmath88 .",
    "the network will have the same 4 working states as the non - mrc df model with an average power @xmath89 the system success probability is defined as @xmath90 we know the combined snr of two independent exponential random variables @xmath48 and @xmath51 has the following distribution @xmath91\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the mean of @xmath48 and @xmath93 is the mean of @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath94 we can substitute ( [ eq : gammasd ] ) , ( [ eq : gammasr ] ) and ( [ eq : combined - snr - df ] ) into ( [ eq : p - success4 ] ) and similarly calculate the average bit energy consumption @xmath95 and the cooperative @xmath96 in the df with mrc as in ( [ eq : ea3 ] ) , ( [ eq : gain3 ] ) in the case of df without mrc .      fig .",
    "[ fig : df - bit ] shows the bit energy consumption with respect to @xmath72 $ ] at a specific distance @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "results similar to those already identified in the fixed af model are observed . at small s - d distances ,",
    "the highest constellation should be preferred .",
    "the optimal constellation size gets smaller as the distance increases .",
    "it is noticed that mrc in the df model provides only very limited improvement in energy efficiency compared with non - mrc . only at points with large @xmath27 and s - d distances ,",
    "mrc curves show better energy efficiency over non - mrc .",
    "however , compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : af - bit ] in the fixed af , the bit energy consumption on these points has been significantly decreased in the selective df model .",
    "very close performance of mrc and non - mrc in the df models is also illustrated in the following figures . in fig .",
    "[ fig : df - distance ] , at a given @xmath27 , the bit energy consumption is increasing as the s - d distance increases , due to the increasing system outage .",
    "but , the bit energy consumption when @xmath77 at large distance has been significantly decreased in the selective df models compared with fig . [",
    "fig : af - distance ] in the fixed af .",
    "[ fig : df - distance - gain ] shows that both mrc and non - mrc in the df mode almost achieve equal cooperative gain . at @xmath97 $ ]",
    ", the curves show almost flat gain less than 1 , which advocates that the direct transmission is more energy efficient . at higher constellation sizes such as @xmath75 or @xmath77",
    ", the system can achieve very high cooperative gains as the distance increases .",
    "compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : af - distance - gain ] , the df models are more energy efficient than the af models , especially at large @xmath27 and s - d distance .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : df - location - gain ] , we have fixed @xmath77 .",
    "when the s - d distance is 25 m in both mrc and non - mrc , changing the relay location does nt affect the gain and direct transmission is more energy efficient because of @xmath98 . at higher s - d distances such as 75 m and 100 m ,",
    "we observe that the system benefits from the cooperative transmission and achieves relatively high cooperative gains .",
    "mrc provides higher gain when the relay is closer to the source .",
    "as the relay moves closer to the destination , both mrc and non - mrc models tend to achieve the same performance .",
    "the maximal cooperative gain is again achieved when the relay is located right in the middle .",
    "we have considered fixed af and selective df models in a 3-node cooperative network . in each model , accurate energy expenditures which consider the circuit , transmission , and retransmission energies are formulated .",
    "the system reliability is derived from the link outage probabilities under a combined path - loss and rayleigh fading channel .",
    "both mrc and non - mrc decoding are performed at the destination in af and df , and the optimal constellation sizes are identified .",
    "several interesting results are observed : 1 ) in fixed af , mrc outperforms non - mrc in terms of achieving less bit energy and higher cooperative gain ; 2 ) in selective df , mrc does nt show much improvement on energy efficiency over non - mrc ; 3 ) at small constellation sizes , direct transmission is more energy efficient in both models , while at large constellation sizes , the system can achieve significant cooperative gains as distance increases ; 4 ) the optimal relay location is the middle between the source and the destination ; 5 ) the selective df is more energy efficient than the fixed af , especially at large constellation size and transmission distance .",
