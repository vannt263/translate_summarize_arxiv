    "understanding coo and other 3@xmath1 monooxides is important for the development of the solid - state theory . their magnetism and the insulating ground state is a subject of a fundamental controversy by more than 70 years .",
    "most models basing on the conventional band theory predict feo , coo and nio , having incomplete 3@xmath1 shell , to be a metal , whereas they are observed to be very good insulators , if stoichiometric .    despite of 70 years of intense studies the problem of the magnetism and",
    "the insulating ground - state of open - shell transition metal oxides is still under debate @xcite .",
    "we have largely solved this problem working in the purely ionic picture ( we call this approach quantum atomistic solid state theory quasst ) . in this paper",
    "we present theoretical description of the magnetism and low - energy electronic structure of coo and the temperature dependence of the specific heat resulting from this structure .",
    "we earlier have described nio @xcite and feo @xcite followed by earlier description of febr@xmath2 @xcite and lacoo@xmath3 @xcite . in refs 14 - 16",
    "we have described nio within the localized atomistic paradigm with only three parameters : the octupolar crystal - field parameter @xmath4 = + 21 k ( 10dq = 1.086 ev ) , the spin - orbit coupling @xmath5 = -480 k and a small trigonal distortion @xmath6 = + 50 k @xcite .",
    "these parameters are related to the lowest 21-fold degenerated @xmath7 term .",
    "a fourth parameter , the molecular - field coefficient @xmath8 of @xmath9 describes the magnetic state .",
    "this @xmath8 value yields @xmath10 of 525 k in good agreement with the experimental observation for nio .    a direct motivation for this paper is presentation by kant _",
    "_ @xcite of new measurements of the specific heat of coo with an attempt to describe properties of coo within an ionic model",
    ". also works of haverkort _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and wdowik and parlinski @xcite from the last year contribute to studies of coo .",
    "we have performed detailed calculations of the low - energy electronic structure related to the 28-fold degenerated @xmath11 term @xcite both in the paramagnetic and magnetic state .",
    "we took into account the experimental crystallographic structure - the @xmath12-type structure with a=424 pm and a tetragonal distortion with c / a=0.988 .",
    "we have calculated the strenght of the octahedral crystal field 10@xmath13=1.19 ev ( @xmath14= -23 k = -2.0 mev - the minus sign is related with the octahedral position of the co@xmath15 ion in the o@xmath16 octahedron ; the calculated octupolar charge moment of surrounding charges at the co site @xmath17 = + 267 ka@xmath18 , a@xmath19 is the bohr radius ; @xmath20 for the co@xmath15 ion is 12.6 a@xmath21 ) .",
    "calculations have been performed within the same scheme as for febr@xmath22 @xcite and for nio @xcite and other our earlier calculations for 4f/5f compounds @xcite . in hamiltonian",
    "we take into account the crystal - field interactions ( the octahedral crystal field with a small tetragonal distortion @xmath23 ) , the spin - orbit interactions @xmath5 and inter - site spin - dependent interactions ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the resulting low - energy electronic structure is shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the magnetically - ordered state",
    "there appears a spin - gap of 466 k ( = 40 mev ) .",
    "the ordered magnetic moment amounts at t= 0 k to 4.04 @xmath24 - it is built from the spin moment of 2.62 @xmath24 and the orbital moment of 1.42 @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the calculated orbital moment gives 35% contribution to the total moment .",
    "the experimentally derived magnetic moment amounts to 4.0 @xmath24 @xcite .    .",
    "the tetragonal distortion is small and causes a slight splitting of the excited quartets .",
    "but this small distortion determines in our calculations the direction of the co magnetic moment , in the coo case with the c - axis compression , along the tetragonal direction .",
    "the formation of the magnetic state we have described for numerous compounds - let mention exemplary 4f/3d/5f compounds erni@xmath25 , febr@xmath2 , nio , feo , upd@xmath2al@xmath3 and uga@xmath2 , results of which have been published starting from 1992 . in all these cases",
    "the magnetic energy is much smaller than the overall cef splitting .",
    "they are both ionic ( febr@xmath2 @xcite , nio , feo @xcite ) and intermetallic ( erni@xmath25 , upd@xmath2al@xmath3 , uga@xmath2 ) @xcite compounds . a derived value of n= -43.8 t/@xmath24 (= -29.4 k ) in coo yields the molecular field acting on the co - ion moment at t = 0 k as 176 t - it corresponds to the exchange field acting on the co spin moment of 271 t and to the exchange energy of 41.2 mev .",
    "the calculated electronic structure very well describes the temperature dependence of the specific heat as is shown in fig .",
    "2 , where the calculated data are compared with experimental data .",
    "the calculated temperature dependence of the specific heat of coo contains three contributions : the 3@xmath1 contribution @xmath26 containing both magnetic and schottky contributions , the lattice and dilation contributions .",
    "the magnetic / schottky contribution is calculated from the derived electronic structure shown in fig . 1 similarly to that discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for febr@xmath22 .",
    "the dilation contribution is linear with temperature @xcite - from thermal expansion and the bulk modulus we calculated its temperature coefficient as 3.4 mj / k@xmath27 mol ( we denote it as @xmath28 to be distinguished from the electronic sommerfeld coefficient ) .",
    "the lattice contribution we approximate by the debye function . we did not have intention to fit perfectly the data but using a value of the debye temperature @xmath29 of 600 k",
    "the experimental data are nicely reproduced in the very wide temperature range , from 0 to 1000 k. here we give some values . at t=200 k @xmath30 = 13.27 , @xmath31 = 33.09 and @xmath32 = 0.68 j / kmol gives total heat of 47.02 j / kmol , which should be compared with 46.03 @xcite ( 46.63 @xcite ) j / k mol . at t=400",
    "k @xmath30 = @xmath33 = 7.15 , @xmath31 = 44.78 and @xmath32 = 1.36 j / kmol gives total heat of 53.29 j / kmol , compared to 54.80 j / kmol @xcite . at t=600 k @xmath30 ( = @xmath33 )",
    "= 5.35 , @xmath31 = 47.62 and @xmath32 = 2.04 j / kmol gives total heat of 55.01 j / kmol , compared to 54.80 j / kmol @xcite .",
    "all of these values are very close to experimental data of refs @xcite as seen in fig .",
    "the derived debye temperature @xmath29 of 600 k is quite similar to a value for @xmath29 of 650 k we have obtained for nio @xcite - it is a very plausible result owing to the structural and compositional similarity of both monoxides .",
    "we would like to note that all of the used by us parameters ( dominant octahedral cef parameter 10@xmath13 of 1.19 ev ( or @xmath4= -23",
    "k ) , the spin - orbit coupling @xmath5= -260 k , lattice distortions b@xmath34 = -1 k ) have clear physical meaning .",
    "the most important assumption is the existence of very strong correlations among 3@xmath1 electrons what assure the preservation of the atomistic ionic integrity of the co@xmath15 ion in the solid coo .",
    "we stress the good reproduction of experimental results like temperature dependence of the heat capacity with a @xmath35-type peak , the value of the magnetic moment and , in particular , its direction .",
    "the crystal - field interactions are relatively strong in coo but not so strong to destroy the ionic integrity of the 3@xmath1 electrons - it forms conditions for adequancy of the quasst theory .",
    "the calculated value 10@xmath13 of 1.19 ev places coo at value of 1.0 at the tanabe - sugano diagram drawn with @xmath13/b as abscissa @xcite .",
    "we have for the first time calculated low - energy electronic structure both in paramagnetic and magnetic state as well as zero - temperature properties and thermodynamics .",
    "we consistently described magnetic properties of coo in agreement with its insulating ground state .",
    "the orbital moment of 1.42 @xmath0 gives 35% contribution to the total moment of 4.04 @xmath0 at t = 0 k. we have calculated from this low - energy electronic structure the temperature dependence of the specific heat being in nice agreement with experimental data . in our approach coo is an insulator independently on distortions and the magnetic order ."
