    "the inversion number , defined as the total number of pairs that are out of sort , provides a natural measure for how `` scrambled '' a list of elements is .",
    "this basic combinatorial quantity @xcite is helpful in many contexts . in computer science",
    ", the inversion number plays an important role in sorting and ranking algorithms @xcite .",
    "common on the web ( `` customers who like @xmath16 may also like @xmath16 '' ) , recommendations for books , songs , and movies use inversions to quantify how close the preferences of two customers are @xcite .",
    "the number of inversions can also be used to measure how the order of a group of particles in one dimension changes with time .",
    "figure [ fig - xt ] illustrates a space - time diagram of four diffusing particles . the number of inversions changes whenever two trajectories cross . depending on the initial order of the two respective particles ,",
    "a crossing may either introduce a new inversion or undo an existing one .",
    "consequently , the inversion number either increases or decreases by one .",
    "therefore , the inversion number equals the difference between the number of crossings of the first kind and the number of crossings of the second kind .    mixing dynamics has been extensively studied in the context of fluids @xcite and granular materials @xcite , but much less attention has been given to mixing in the context of diffusion @xcite . in this study , we consider an ensemble of @xmath0 diffusing particles in one - dimension , a system that is widely used to model the transport of colloidal and biological particles in narrow channels @xcite .",
    "we use the inversion number to measure the degree to which particles mix .",
    "clearly , a persistent small inversion number indicates a poorly mixed system , while a large inversion number implies that the opposite is true .",
    "we first study how the distribution of the inversion number evolves with time .",
    "we find that there is a transient regime in which the average inversion number as well as the standard deviation in this quantity both grow as the square - root of time .",
    "the distribution of the inversion number is stationary beyond this transient regime . when the number of particles is sufficiently large , the probability distribution function is always gaussian , whether in the transient regime or in the steady - state .",
    "s and @xmath17s indicate whether the inversion number increases or decreases when two trajectories cross .",
    "four out of the five crossings increase the inversion number , and accordingly , the inversion number increases from @xmath18 to @xmath19.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    our main focus is first - passage properties @xcite of the inversion number .",
    "we ask : what is @xmath4 , the probability that the inversion number remains smaller than @xmath1 up to time @xmath5 . for small values of @xmath1 , the survival probability @xmath20 measures the likelihood that the particles remain poorly mixed throughout the evolution .",
    "generally , the probabilities @xmath20 decay as a power law at large times , @xmath21 . in general , there is a broad spectrum of @xmath7 distinct exponents , , that governs the asymptotic decay of the survival probabilities .",
    "we heavily use first - passage kinetics of a single particle that diffuses inside a circular cone @xcite to understand the asymptotic behavior of @xmath20 .",
    "we first utilize two - dimensional cones to obtain the first - passage exponents for a three - particle system exactly .",
    "furthermore , we employ circular cones in @xmath22 dimensions and find good approximate values for the first - passage exponents .",
    "the cone approximation correctly predicts that when the number of particles is large , the exponents become a universal function , @xmath9 , of the scaling variable @xmath23 .",
    "here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the average and standard deviation of the distribution of inversion number , at the steady - state .",
    "interestingly , our numerical simulations show that the cone approximation yields the exact scaling function @xmath26 as a root of a transcendental equation involving the parabolic cylinder function .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce our basic system and define the inversion number .",
    "stationary and transient properties of the distribution of the inversion number are discussed in sections iii and iv , respectively . in section",
    "v , we use the cone approximation to understand first - passage properties of the inversion number .",
    "scaling and extremal properties of the first - passage exponents are the focus of section vi .",
    "we conclude in section vii .",
    "our goal is to characterize how the order of an ensemble of diffusing particles changes with time .",
    "we conveniently use an ordinary random walk @xcite to model the trajectory of a diffusing particle @xcite .",
    "our system includes @xmath0 identical particles that move on an unbounded one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the particles are completely independent : at each step one particle is selected at random and it moves , with an equal probability , either to the left , @xmath27 , or to the right , @xmath28 .",
    "after each elementary step , time is augmented by the inverse number of particles , @xmath29 , so that each particle moves once per unit time .",
    "we index the particles according to their initial position with the leftmost particle labeled @xmath30 and the rightmost particle labeled @xmath31 ( figure [ fig - xt ] ) .",
    "let @xmath32 be the position of the @xmath33th particle at time @xmath5 . by definition ,",
    "@xmath34 but the initial order unravels with time .",
    "consider , for example , the four - particle system illustrated in figure [ fig - xt ] .",
    "the particles reach a state where with three pairs , @xmath35 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 being out of sort compared with time @xmath36 . in general , a pair of particles for which @xmath37 and @xmath38 constitutes an inversion .",
    "formally , the total number of inversions , @xmath1 , is given by @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is the heaviside step function : @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "the total number of pairs is @xmath45 , and hence , the variable @xmath1 is within the bounds @xmath46 with @xmath47 the inversion number is minimal , @xmath18 , when the order is exactly the same as in the initial configuration , and it is maximal , @xmath48 , when the order is the mirror image of the initial state .",
    "the inversion number changes whenever two trajectories cross ( figure [ fig - xt ] ) . a crossing either adds a new inversion or removes an existing one .",
    "thus , we may assign a positive or a negative `` charge '' to each crossing as illustrated in figure [ fig - xt ] .",
    "the inversion number , @xmath49 , is simply the sum of all of the charges up to time @xmath5 .",
    "we first discuss basic statistical characteristics of the inversion number including the average , the variance , and more generally , the probability distribution function . at large time @xmath5",
    ", each random walk explores a region of size @xmath50 , and the probability of finding the particle at any lattice site inside this region is effectively uniform .",
    "this simple fact already implies that memory of the initial position fades with time .",
    "we thus expect that after sufficient time elapses , there is no memory of the initial order , and the order of the particles is completely random .    to understand statistics of the inversion number for randomly ordered particles we consider the set of all @xmath51 permutations of the @xmath0 elements @xmath52 . in the random state ,",
    "each permutation of these elements occurs with probability @xmath53 .",
    "the probability @xmath54 that the inversion number equals @xmath1 for a random permutation is well known as the mahonian distribution in probability theory @xcite .",
    "we highlight key features of this probability distribution as it plays a central role in our study .",
    "let @xmath55 be the number of permutations of @xmath0 elements with exactly @xmath1 inversions .",
    "for example , when @xmath56 , one permutation ( @xmath57 ) is free of inversions , there are two permutations with one inversion ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) , two permutations with two inversions ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) , and a single permutation with three inversions ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath63 while @xmath64 .",
    "we list the distribution of the inversion number for @xmath65 , @xmath66 of course , @xmath54 is nonzero if and only if @xmath67 .    since the mirror image of a configuration with @xmath1 inversions necessarily has @xmath68 inversions , the probability distribution satisfies @xmath69 .",
    "hence , the distribution is symmetric about @xmath70 , and the average @xmath71 is simply @xmath72 therefore , the average grows quadratically with the total number of particles when @xmath73 .",
    "the mahonian distribution satisfies the simple recursion relation @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "this recursion reflects that every permutation of @xmath0 elements can be generated from a permutation of @xmath22 elements by inserting the @xmath0th element in any of the @xmath0 possible positions .",
    "depending on where this last element is added , the number of inversions increases by an amount @xmath76 .",
    "let us now introduce the generating function , @xmath77 for instance , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in general",
    ", the generating function is given by the product @xcite @xmath81 as also follows from the recursion .",
    "we can confirm the average by differentiating the generating function once , @xmath82 , where the prime represents differentiation with respect @xmath83 . by differentiating the generating function twice and using @xmath84",
    ", we obtain the variance @xcite , @xmath85 , @xmath86 this expression is obtained from @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , the standard deviation is rather large , @xmath3 , when @xmath73 .",
    "the mean and the variance fully specify the probability distribution function for an asymptotically large number of particles .",
    "the mahonian distribution becomes a function of a single variable , @xmath88 , with the scaling variable @xmath89 the probability distribution function , @xmath90 , is normal , that is , a gaussian with zero mean and unit variance @xcite , @xmath91 to see that the central limit theorem applies , we convert the generating function into a fourier transform , and then show that the fourier transform is gaussian in the large-@xmath0 limit @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath92 is a more transparent measure in the following sense .",
    "a value of @xmath92 of order one implies fairly random order . indeed , according to the normal distribution",
    ", the inversion number falls within three standard deviations from the mean , @xmath93 , with probability @xmath94 .",
    "a large value , @xmath95 , indicates that the particle order strongly resembles the initial configuration ( if @xmath96 ) or its mirror image ( if @xmath97 ) .",
    "by definition , the inversion number is zero initially , @xmath98 .",
    "at least partially , the initial order is preserved in the early stages of evolution , and the number of inversions must be substantially lower than .",
    "we consider the natural initial condition where the particles occupy @xmath0 consecutive lattice sites : @xmath99 , for all @xmath100 .",
    "early on , particles `` interact '' only within their local neighborhood .",
    "the interaction length , @xmath101 , grows diffusively with time , @xmath102 . on this length scale , particles are well - mixed , and according to , the number of inversions _ per particle _ is proportional to the number of interacting particles , @xmath101 .",
    "hence , the average number of inversions grows according to @xmath103 . as a consequence , @xmath104 when @xmath73 .",
    "the two expressions match at , a diffusive time scale that can be viewed as the mixing time .",
    "therefore , there is a transient regime in which the inversion number grows as the square - root of time , followed by a steady - state , in which the average is given by .",
    "we obtain the variance using a similar heuristic argument . according to , the variance per particle is quadratic in the number of interacting particles ,",
    ". therefore , in the transient regime , @xmath105 as expected , the transient behavior matches the steady - state behavior at the diffusive time scale @xmath106 . like",
    "the average , the standard deviation also grows as the square root of time .    as shown in figure",
    "[ fig - average ] , results of numerical simulations confirm the scaling behavior .",
    "moreover , the numerically measured average matches the steady - state value corresponding to the mahonian distribution .",
    "we also verified that the stationary distribution is gaussian with the variance .",
    "the simulations also show that the time - dependent distribution of inversion number , @xmath107 , is gaussian throughout the transient regime ( figure [ fig - distribution ] ) : @xmath108.\\ ] ] this behavior provides further support for our heuristic argument . indeed , if the particles are well - mixed locally , then the distribution of the number of inversions per particle is gaussian , and as the sum of @xmath0 gaussian variables , the total inversion number must also have a gaussian distribution .",

    "also shown for reference is the normal distribution .,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    we used two different algorithms to simulate the diffusion process . in the naive algorithm , we randomly select a particle and move it to a randomly - chosen neighboring site .",
    "we increase time by @xmath118 after each jump . to calculate the inversion number , we use the formula , but since this enumeration requires @xmath119 operations , this simulation method is inefficient at large @xmath0 .",
    "to overcome this difficulty , we introduced a variant where each lattice site may be occupied by at most one particle . at each step",
    "we pick one particle at random and attempt to move it by one site .",
    "this move is always accepted if the neighboring site is vacant , but otherwise , it is accepted with probability @xmath111 . in the latter case , we merely exchange the identities of the respective particles , and as appropriate , update the inversion number by either @xmath120 or @xmath121 . in our implementation , there are two arrays : the first lists the particle positions , _ in order _ , and the second lists the original position of each particle in the first list .",
    "this algorithm has a fixed computational cost per step , and it automatically keeps track of the inversion number .",
    "we rely on the fact that in one dimension , noninteracting random walks are equivalent to random walks that interact by exclusion @xcite .",
    "still , we verified that the two algorithms yield essentially the same results .",
    "we utilized the naive algorithm to simulate small systems with @xmath122 , but otherwise , we used the efficient algorithm .",

    "we ask : what is the probability , @xmath4 , that the inversion number remains smaller than @xmath1 until time @xmath5 .",

    "the quantity @xmath125 is the probability that the original order is perfectly maintained , or equivalently , the likelihood that none of the trajectories cross .",
    "this survival probability decays as a power law , with a rather large exponent , @xmath126 in the long - time limit @xcite .",
    "our goal is to understand how this asymptotic behavior changes as the threshold @xmath1 increases .",
    "when @xmath127 , the separation between the two random walks itself undergoes a random walk .",
    "hence , @xmath125 is equivalent to the survival probability of a one - dimensional random walk in the vicinity of a trap , and @xmath128 in agreement with .    when @xmath56 , we conveniently map the three random walks onto a single `` compound '' random walk in three dimensions with the coordinates @xmath129 . to find @xmath125 , we require that the compound walk remains inside the region @xmath130 .",
    "we may view the boundary of this region as absorbing , and then , @xmath131 equals the likelihood that that the compound walk survives at time @xmath5 .",
    "the absorbing boundary forms a wedge because it is defined by the intersection of two planes , @xmath132 and .",
    "generally , the survival probability of a particle that diffuses inside an absorbing wedge decays algebraically , @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the normalized opening angle @xcite .",
    "( the opening angle @xmath135 is the angle between the wedge axis and the wedge boundary . )",
    "alternatively , @xmath136 is the fraction of the total solid angle enclosed by the wedge .",
    "the region @xmath130 occupies a fraction @xmath137 of space and hence , @xmath138 , as also follows from . to find @xmath139 and @xmath140",
    ", we note that the regions in which the compound walk is allowed to move are always wedges ( the three planes @xmath132 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 divide space into six equal wedges @xcite . )",
    "moreover , the fraction of total solid angle enclosed by the absorbing boundaries is given by the cumulative distribution of inversion number : and .",

    "moreover , there is a large family of exponents @xmath148 that characterizes the power - law decay .",
    "we stress that the exponents depend on two variables , the threshold @xmath1 and the number of particles @xmath0 , .",
    "we already know the exact values @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 as well as @xmath152 .",
    "our numerical simulations confirm that indeed , there is a large spectrum of exponents . as shown in figure [ fig - beta4 ] , there are six decay exponents when @xmath153 .",
    "table i lists the numerically measured values @xmath154 , obtained from the local slope @xmath155 .    in general , the compound walk is confined to a certain `` allowed '' region of space .",
    "this region is bounded by multiple intersecting planes of the type @xmath156 with @xmath157 , and generally , this unbounded domain has a complicated geometry .",
    "the boundary of this region encloses a fraction @xmath158 of the total solid angle . on combinatorial grounds alone",

    "the smallest exponent @xmath174 characterizes the probability @xmath175 that the order of the walkers does not turn into the mirror image of the initial state , that is , the probability that the compound walk remains in the _ exterior _ of the so - called `` weyl chamber '' @xmath176 @xcite .",
    "this domain has @xmath177 , and table ii lists the outcome of the cone approximation for small @xmath0 . to find the outcome of the cone approximation at large @xmath0",
    ", we first estimate the opening angle , @xmath178 by using eq .   and the stirling formula @xmath179 . from the asymptotic behavior for wide cones at large dimensions , @xcite , we conclude @xcite @xmath180 this value is extremely small , decaying roughly as the inverse of a factorial , and it is impossible to measure such a minuscule quantity using numerical simulations .",
    "the largest exponent describes the probability that the particles maintain the initial order or that the compound walk remains in the _ interior _ of the weyl chamber with @xmath181 .",
    "table ii compares the outcome of the cone approximation with the exact value @xmath182 .",
    "the quality of the cone approximation worsens as @xmath0 grows . nevertheless , the cone approximation is qualitatively correct . by substituting the opening angle @xmath183 into the thin - cone asymptotic behavior @xmath184 @xcite , we find @xmath185",
    ". this expression captures the quadratic growth of the exponent .",
    "remarkably , the cone approximation is exact inside the scaling region , but it is only approximate outside this region .",
    "in summary , we used the number of pair inversions to measure the one - dimensional mixing of independent diffusing trajectories . a high inversion number typifies strong mixing whereas a persistent small inversion number indicates poor mixing . in the steady - state , the distribution of inversion number is given by the well - known mahonian distribution , and consequently , it is gaussian when the number of particles is large .",
    "preceding the steady - state is a transient regime in which both the average inversion number and the standard deviation grow diffusively with time .",
    "we focused on first - passage statistics and showed that the probability that the inversion number does not exceed a certain threshold decays as power law with time .",
    "moreover , we found that a large spectrum of decay exponents characterizes the asymptotic behavior .",
    "when the number of particles is large , the exponents obey a universal scaling function .",
    "the scaling variable equals the distance between the threshold inversion number and the average inversion number , measured in terms of the standard deviation .    the cone approximation , which replaces the region in which the compound random walk is allowed to move with an unbounded circular cone , plays a central role in our analysis .",
    "this approach is exact for three particles , it produces very good estimates in higher dimensions , and remarkably , this framework yields the exact scaling function .",
    "the cone approximation gives lower bounds for the decay exponents because , among all unbounded domains with the same solid angle , the perfectly circular cone maximizes the survival probability @xcite .",
    "the cone approximation is useful in answering other first - passage questions such as the probability that the @xmath33th rightmost random walk does not cross the origin and the probability that the original rightmost particle always remains ahead of at least @xmath33 other particles @xcite . in both cases , there are as many exponents as there are particles , and curiously , the circular cone framework produces the scaling function governing the first - passage exponents approximately in the first case and exactly in the second case .",
    "understanding when the cone approximation is exact and when it is approximate is an interesting challenge , with implications well beyond first - passage @xcite .",
    "the first - passage exponent is directly related to the lowest eigenvalue of the laplace operator , and therefore , we conclude that the lowest eigenvalue of the laplacian similarly obeys scaling laws in high dimensions .",
    "the shape of the scaling function depends on the actual geometry @xcite ."
