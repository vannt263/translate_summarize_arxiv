    "the investigation of the @xmath0-meson photoproduction at low energies , @xmath3 gev , plays an important role in understanding the non - perturbative pomeron exchange dynamics and the nature of @xmath4 interaction .",
    "it was expected that in the diffractive region the dominant contribution comes from the pomeron exchange , since the processes associated with conventional meson ( quark ) exchanges are suppressed by the ozi rule  @xcite .",
    "an example of such a ( suppressed ) process is the pseudoscalar @xmath5 and @xmath6 meson exchange which , as a rule , were considered as a small correction to the dominant pomeron exchange channel .",
    "the pomeron exchange amplitude is usually described in terms of the donnachie - landshoff model  @xcite , where the pomeron couples to single constituent quarks as a @xmath7 isoscalar photon or / and its two - gluon exchange modification  @xcite .",
    "these models are designed for the vector meson photoproduction at high energy and small momentum transfer .",
    "the validity of an extrapolation of these models into the low energy region and close to the threshold is not clear . near threshold ,",
    "the models predict a monotonic increase of the differential cross section of @xmath8 reaction at forward photoproduction angle with energy .",
    "however , a recent analysis of the @xmath0 photoproduction at low energy by the leps collaboration shows a sizeable deviation from this prediction , in particular , the data show a bump structure around @xmath9  gev  @xcite .",
    "another peculiarity of the leps data is a strong deviation of the spin - density matrix element @xmath10 from 0.5 , which is in favor of a sizable contribution of un - natural parity exchange processes .",
    "these facts rise several questions : ( i ) whether one has to modify the conventional pomeron exchange model at low energy , ( ii ) what is the source of un - natural parity exchange channels , ( iii ) whether we need to introduce some exotic channels ( additional regge trajectories , processes associated with possible hidden strangeness in the nucleon , etc . ) to describe the data . in principle , these questions are related to each other and have to be analyzed simultaneously .",
    "thus , for example , the mentioned bump - like behavior may be a result of the interplay of the pseudoscalar exchange amplitude and modified pomeron exchange channels .",
    "the coherent @xmath0 photoproduction off the deuteron in the diffraction region seems to be very useful for such an analysis .",
    "first of all , the isovector @xmath5-meson exchange amplitude is eliminated in case of the isoscalar target .",
    "therefore , the appearance of the bump - like structure in the energy dependence of the differential cross section of the reaction @xmath11 would favor a modification of the conventional pomeron exchange amplitude .",
    "the next step is an analysis of spin observables , in particular , the properties of the decay @xmath12 with unpolarized and polarized photon beams .",
    "the incoherent @xmath0 photoproduction in @xmath13 reaction allows to extract observables of the reaction @xmath14 which can be used for a simultaneous analysis of photoproduction off neutron and proton targets in order to get additional and independent hint to a manifestation of possible exotic channels .",

    "[ fig:1 ] ( a , b ) and ( c , d ) , respectively .",
    "the single and double        scattering diagrams are shown in ( a , b ) and ( c , d ) , respectively . the internal dashed line in ( b ) and",
    "( d ) corresponds to `` diagonal '' ( @xmath15 ) and `` non - diagonal '' ( @xmath16 ) transitions , respectively . in this paper",
    "we study the @xmath0 meson photoproduction at low energies with @xmath17  gev at forward photoproduction angles with momentum transfer @xmath18  gev@xmath19 , where the single scattering processes are dominant .",
    "the coherent @xmath0-meson photoproduction at higher values of @xmath20 is controlled by the double scattering processes , which can provide important information about the cross section of the @xmath4 scattering  @xcite .",
    "however , this interesting topic is beyond scope of our present analysis , where we focus just on the extremely forward @xmath0 meson photoproduction , where some hint to an `` anomaly '' in the differential cross section of @xmath8 reaction was found  @xcite .",

    "a similar agreement holds for the other energy bins , too .",
    "the agreement between the experimental data and the calculations for the @xmath275 angular distributions in @xmath1 and @xmath276 reactions means that the model describes correctly the @xmath0 photoproduction off the neutron , and in particularly , supports our choice of the pseudoscalar channel with a small contribution of the @xmath6 meson exchange .",
    "the sum @xmath277 determines the @xmath0 meson decay distribution as a function of the angle between production and beam polarization planes @xmath278 it is important that parity conservation requires @xmath279  @xcite , which makes @xmath280 invariant under rotation of the coordinate frame in the production plane .",
    "this means that @xmath281 .",
    "therefore , it is natural that this invariant function determines the distribution which depends only on the beam polarization .",

    "one can see some increase of @xmath280 when going from @xmath282 ( a ) to @xmath283  gev@xmath19 ( b ) .",
    "this is explained by an increasing contribution of spin - flip transitions with @xmath20 .",
    "we studied different aspects of coherent and incoherent @xmath0 meson photoproduction off the deuteron at forward photoproduction angles with the aim to check whether the recent experimental data require the inclusion of some exotic channels discussed in literature . for this purpose",
    "we re - analyzed the elementary @xmath83 reaction in order to use it as an input for our study .",
    "the corresponding amplitude in the diffractive region is expressed as a sum of pomeron and pseudoscalar exchange channels .",
    "the first one represents a slightly modified donnachie - landshoff pomeron exchange amplitude , whereas the second one is the coherent sum of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 meson exchange channels . in present work",
    "the contribution of the @xmath6 exchange channel is relatively weak , and correspondingly , the @xmath5 exchange is enhanced in order to get the proper relative contributions of the channels with natural and un - natural parity exchange .",
    "the donnachie - landshoff model is designed for high energy and it is not clear whether it can be applied at low energies , and close to the threshold as well .",
    "we performed a detailed analysis of the differential cross section of the @xmath83 reaction at @xmath85  gev and obtained a reasonable agreement between the model predictions and the available experimental data in diffraction region . at larger momentum",
    "transfer our model underestimates recent data of leps and saphir but is quite reasonable for the bonn and jlab data up to @xmath284  gev@xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "the pomeron exchange model , motivated by the two - gluon dynamics , contains terms responsible for single and double spin - flip transitions .",
    "the model predictions for the spin - density matrix elements being sensitive to the spin - flip transitions are in agreement with available data for the @xmath1 reaction at @xmath85  gev , which also decreases the space left for possible exotic channels .",
    "therefore we can conclude , that for a clear understanding a possible manifestation of an exotic channel one needs a complete set of @xmath86 dependences for unpolarized cross sections and polarization observables at different energies .",
    "we developed a model for the coherent and incoherent @xmath0 meson photoproduction off the deuteron and performed again a detailed analysis of the existing data .",
    "the slope of the differential cross section of the coherent @xmath0 meson photoproduction is defined by the corresponding slope of the elementary @xmath222 reaction and by the deuteron form factor .",
    "we found a quite reasonable agreement between the model prediction and the experimental data in the diffractive region and some underestimate at large @xmath285  gev@xmath19 , which favor the contributions of more complicated channels , for example , double scattering processes .",
    "but on the other hand , the model calculation of the @xmath12 decay distribution , @xmath235 , at @xmath286  gev is in a good agreement with the experimental data , which , to some extent , support the single scattering model in this region of @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the remaining difference between theory and experiment at @xmath285  gev@xmath19 requires further investigation .",
    "we performed detailed and combined investigation of several important spin density matrix elements for @xmath83 , coherent @xmath11 , and incoherent @xmath288 reactions aimed at ( i ) studying effect of elimination of the isovector @xmath5 meson exchange in coherent @xmath2 reaction , and ( ii ) extracting observables for the @xmath23 reaction .",
    "the elimination of the @xmath5 meson exchange has two consequences .",
    "one is the relative decrease of channels with spin - conserving amplitudes , which result in an increase of the relative contributions of the spin flip transitions .",
    "this leads to an enhancement of the corresponding spin density matrix elements .",
    "another one is related to a strong suppression of the amplitude with un - natural parity exchange and shift @xmath10 matrix element towards 0.5 .",
    "we got a common description of @xmath0 meson decay distributions for @xmath83 and incoherent @xmath288 reactions confirming the reliability of our model for the @xmath23 reaction .    to summarize",
    "we can conclude , that the existing experimental data ( including also very recent data ) on @xmath1 , coherent @xmath11 , and incoherent @xmath288 reactions in the diffraction region at low energies support the model based on the dominance of the donnachie - landshoff pomeron plus @xmath289 exchange channels with a relatively weak @xmath6 meson contribution . for a definite conclusion about a possible manifestation of exotic channels one has to improve the resolution of the data with providing additional information on the channels with spin- and double - spin flip transitions being sensitive to properties of the photoproduction amplitude in @xmath1 and @xmath2 reaction .",
