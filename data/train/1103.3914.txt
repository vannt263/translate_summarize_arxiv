    "the dynamics of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) is often investigated under the mean - field theory ( mft ) , which provides a classical field equation for the nonlinear matter wave and is the classical limit of the quantum theory in large number limit .",
    "mft works successfully in predicting experimental results as the particle numbers of bec is very large , so the classical limit captures the essence . in the vicinity of a mean - field dynamical instability ,",
    "however , the quantum correction to the mft becomes important  @xcite .",
    "they provide accurate predictions for the dynamics by combining the mean - field with the fluctuations . as most investigations are done under the mft , it is interesting to look at their behavior under quantum corrections .",
    "on the other hand , the analogy to quantum optics is noticed in investigating bec , because of its macrosscopic coherence that allowes us to view it as a large atom .",
    "a recent example is the discovery of a dark variable for the double - well bec by ottaviani et al  @xcite , which is a nonlinear matter - wave extension of vitanov and shore s work  @xcite of a two - state atom , where a dark variable is found by looking into the analogy between the optical two - state bloch equation and the three - state stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( strap ) equations  @xcite .",
    "they compose three variables analogous to the bloch spin from the ground states of the two wells and the dark variable is found by comparing the equation of the three variables with the strap equation .",
    "the adiabatic splitting , transport and self - trapping of the double - well bec are investigated using this dark variable  @xcite under the mft .",
    "the strap can be utilized to transport bec in multiple wells  @xcite@xmath0@xcite .    in the paper",
    ", we give a fully quantized version of the work of ottaviani et al .",
    "we introduce further quantum corrections by including higher order interactions beyond the on - site interaction .",
    "if these quantum corrections are turned off , this model would reduce to the two - mode bec widely used in quantum entanglement  @xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "in mft , the two - mode approximation is applied to the gp equation and the dynamics of the double - well bec  @xcite is @xmath1 where the hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 introducing the field operator @xmath3 , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath4 where is the single particle hamiltonian with @xmath5 the double - well potential and is the nonlinear interaction parameter with @xmath6 the @xmath7-wave scattering length . only spatial degrees of freedom and two - body interactions are considered . under the two mode approximation , where all modes are omitted except the condensate modes ,",
    "the field operator can be expanded , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the annihilation operator and the ground state of the left and the right well respectively .",
    "the overlap between the two ground states is neglected because it is small compared with the on - site part , @xmath10 .",
    "now the second quantized hamiltonian becomes @xmath11 with the parameters @xmath12 with @xmath13 the chemical potential of the two wells respectively and @xmath14 the nonlinear on - site interaction between particles in the same well .",
    "the tunneling rate @xmath15 between the two wells is negtive , but it can also be defined to be positive by adding corresponding minus signs in the hamiltonian .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the hamiltonian by the schwinger angular momentum operators @xmath16 where @xmath17 corresponds to the correlation between the two wells and @xmath18 is the particle number difference between the two wells .",
    "the hamiltonian under these angular momentum operators becomes @xmath19 with @xmath20 the total particle number , @xmath21 the sum of the two chemical potentials and @xmath22 the difference of the two chemical potential .",
    "terms containing @xmath23 and @xmath24 are assumed to be conserved and are neglected from the hamiltonian .",
    "this is the often used hamiltonian in quantum entanglement , which only the on - site interaction is included .",
    "the dynamics of the system manifests in the evolution of these angular momentum operators @xmath25 equation `` eq .",
    "( [ simpledynamics ] ) '' is the second quantized version of the dynamics given in ref .  , where it is described by the evolution equation of the bloch spin vector  @xcite , @xmath26 the elements of the block spin vector @xmath27 are composed from the two modal populations .",
    "the two evolution equations would resemble each other with the angular momentum operator corresponding to the bloch spin vector , if we normalize the angular momentum operator by @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the nonlinear interaction parameter becomes @xmath30 under this normalization , which becomes the same @xmath31 in `` eq .",
    "( [ firstquantized ] ) '' . without the normalization , the adiabatic",
    "splitting , transport and self - trapping can be given by the motion of the angular momentum operator on the bloch sphere with radius @xmath32 , while in ref .",
    "it corresponds to the motion of the bloch spine in the unit sphere .",
    "the adiabatic transport corresponds to the variance of @xmath33 from @xmath34 to @xmath35 then to @xmath28 and the self - trapping corresponds to its variance from @xmath34 to @xmath35 then back to @xmath28 .    except the resemblance of their appearance ,",
    "these two equations are quite different .",
    "the first one is the quantized version of the second one and it is the evolution equation for quantum operators rather than classical variables .",
    "we can approximate the operators with their expectation values , with the lowest - order approximation corresponding the mft and the second - order approximation corresponding to the equation given by ref .  .",
    "also two diagonal terms of @xmath36 emerge in the quantized version , which puts a phase factor to @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "so the phases are also important in the dynamics .",
    "the phases and particle numbers can be investigated under the mean field approximation  @xcite , where they exhibit oscillations in the phase space . in the angular momentum space",
    ", we can choose the eigenstates of @xmath18 as the basis set @xmath39 .",
    "the state of the system at time @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the initial state with the left well population .",
    "the adiabatic transport of the system then means the evolution from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "the above quantized version of ref .   only includes the nonlinear effects up to the on - site interaction .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the effects of the neglected interactions , which becomes useful when its behavior is investigated under a wide parameter regime . to do this , we add to the hamiltonian `` eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonianboson ] ) '' the overlapping part @xmath45 and introduce two new parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 to describe their effects , where @xmath46 captures interactions between the tunneling particle and the on - site particle and @xmath47 captures interactions between the tunneling particles themselves .",
    "we term the tunneling particle as tunnelier for simplicity .",
    "now the full hamiltonian is given by @xmath48 with the newly introduced parameters given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "for simplicity reasons , we have assumed @xmath51 . in the schwinger representation , this hamiltonian becomes @xmath52 this representation illustrates the interactions between the tunneliers , with @xmath53 the interaction between left tunneliers ( particles tunneling from the right well to the left well ) , @xmath54 the interaction between the right tunneliers ( particles tunneling from the left well to the right well ) , and @xmath55 the interaction between the left tunnelier and the right tunnelier .",
    "we can see the modifications introduced to the hamiltonian by comparing it with `` eq .",
    "( [ simpleangular ] ) '' .",
    "the interaction between the tunnelier and the on - site particle adds a term @xmath56 to the original tunneling parameter @xmath15 , the interaction between the left and the right tunneliers adds a term @xmath57 to the original nonlinear on - site interaction parameter @xmath14 and the interaction of the left tunneliers and that of the right tunneliers add another nonlinear terms @xmath58 to the whole hamiltonian .",
    "the equation of motion of these operators is @xmath59    compared with `` eq .",
    "( [ simpledynamics ] ) '' , this equation is non - symmetric and there is even a phase term of @xmath18 . by the definition of @xmath18 , there is no phase term as the phases carried by @xmath60 is canceled out in @xmath61 and @xmath62 . the origin of this phase term of @xmath18 manifests in the commutation relationship of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which is introduced in deriving this equation of motion from the hamiltonian `` eq .  ( [ fullhamiltonian ] ) '' .    in ref .",
    ", the nonlinear parameter @xmath14 generates a rich adiabatic dynamics of the double - well bec . here",
    "the quantum corrections introduced by @xmath47 and @xmath65 makes the dynamics even more complex .",
    "when @xmath47 and @xmath65 are small compared with @xmath14 , the influence may not be very explicit ; but when they are large enough , the formulations above would lose sense as the two - mode assumption no longer holds true .",
    "numerical simulations are needed to investigate their influence to the dynamics under various parameter regimes .",
    "we have obtained quantum corrections of higher order interactions for the quantized dynamics of the double - well bec and given a fully quantized expression of it under the two - mode approximation .",
    "two new parameters are obtained to express the influence of the interactions between the tunneling particle and the on - site particle and between the tunneling particles .",
    "so the dynamics of the double - well bec becomes more rich under this quantized version .",
    "this allowes numerical simulation for a wide range of parameter regime and new phenomenon may be obtained .",
