    "one of the most interesting and , at the moment , controversial problems in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics is to understand the mircoscopic origins of the entropy production in non - equilibrium processes , especially the entropy production envisaged by irreversible thermodynamics for the usual hydrodynamic processes . by this one means that one should start from some totally microscopic description of a system in some intitial state , show that in the course of time the system approaches a stationary state , in some sense , and then calculate the entropy production associated with this process .",
    "there is no clear definition of the microscopic entropy production , however , and this in itself presents a problem .",
    "one choice of an entropy was provided by gibbs with a definition based upon the full phase space distribution function of a classical system .",
    "however , the gibbs entropy defined with respect to the phase space distribution function remains constant in time , if the time dependence of the distribution function is determined by the liouville equation , as it is for conservative , hamiltonian systems .",
    "one solution to this particular problem has long been discussed , the use of the gibbs entropy as a measure of a non - equilibrium entropy requires that every possible trajectory in phase space ( except for a set of measure zero ) be followed in time with infinite precision , but if one relaxes this requirement and only follows trajectories to within some specified precision , i.e.  coarse grains \" the description , then one obtains an entropy function that increases with time .",
    "of course , an increase with time does not automatically imply an agreement of the entropy production with the laws of irreversible thermodynamics .    as a consequence of these considerations ,",
    "a number of issues remain to be resolved :    1 .",
    "is a coarse grained gibbs entropy the best candidate for a definition of a non - equilibrium entropy  ?",
    "if so , how does one correctly define the coarse graining process  ? to what extent are results so obtained independent of the coarse graining procedure  ?",
    "3 .   do any definitions of entropy production lead to the laws of irreversible thermodynamics , and if so , when and why  ?    there is , of course an enormous literature on all of these questions . here",
    "we wish only to discuss some recent progress in answering them based upon the approach to a theory of irreversible processes through dynamical systems theory .",
    "gaspard @xcite has considered a microscopic model of diffusion of particles in one dimension , called a multi - baker model , where the dynamics is modeled by a baker s transformation taking place on a one - dimensional lattice , where a unit square is associated to every site . here",
    "the one - dimensional lattice is identified as the configuration space of a random walker where diffusion takes place .",
    "the baker s transformation exchanges points of the unit squares between neighboring cells and allows for a deterministic description of the random walk , i.  e. keeping the dynamics on the configuration space unchanged .",
    "the variables on the unit square are irrelevant to the diffusion process and , in themselves , have no physical meaning , other than insuring the measure - preserving nature and reversibility of the dynamics .",
    "gaspard considered a finite length chain , @xmath0 and defined the dynamics on the unit squares so that particles would be sent either to the adjacent right or left intervals depending upon their location along the expanding direction in the unit square .",
    "tasaki and gaspard @xcite considered the case where a steady gradient in particle density was maintained along the chain , and were able to show that fractal - like structures formed by regions of differing microscopic densities , appear in the two dimensional phase space .",
    "the fractal like structures become real fractals in the infinite volume limit , as @xmath1 .",
    "these fractal - like structures are strict consequences of the dynamics given the presence of a density gradient produced by particle reservoirs at the boundaries .",
    "their importance for the theory of entropy production , as pointed out by gaspard @xcite , lies in the fact that they provide a fundamental reason for coarse graining the distribution function .",
    "that is , for large systems , the microscopic variations in density take place on such fine scales that no reasonable measurement process would or should be able to detect these variations .",
    "gaspard @xcite showed that the steady state production of entropy in this model is in agreement with the predictions of irreversible thermodynamics and further , that the entropy production is independent of the coarse graining size over a wide range of possible coarse graining sizes . while it is not entirely clear why this procedure leads to results in agreement with irreversible thermodynamics , the model and procedure are sufficiently interesting and stimulating that one would hope to find further examples so as to gain some deeper insights into the nature of entropy production , hopefully in general , and certainly in this group of baker transformation like models .",
    "a closely related , independent approach to the problem of entropy production in non - equilibrium steady states is provided by tl , vollmer , and breymann ( tvb ) in a series of papers @xcite , also devoted to diffusion in multi - baker models .",
    "these authors considered the entropy production in measure preserving maps as well as in dissipative maps that do not preserve the lebesgue measure and model systems with gaussian thermostats .",
    "the tvb systems also show that a coarse grained distribution function leads to a positive entropy production in agreement with non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "in addition to considering a wider class of models than gaspard , they used a different coarse graining scheme that was not devised to expose the underlying fractal structures of the srb measures of the two dimensional phase space associated with their models .",
    "they also argued that their results for the entropy production should be largely independent of the type of coarse graining scheme used .",
    "a generalization of the methods of gaspard @xcite and tvb @xcite was proposed by the present authors in a recent paper @xcite , where it was shown that a coarse - grained form of the gibbs entropy , which can be expressed in terms of the measures and volumes of the coarse graining sets partitioning the phase , leads to an entropy production formula similar to gaspard s and applicable to more general volume - preserving as well as dissipative models , such as those considered by tvb , as well as multi - baker maps with energy flow considered by tasaki and gaspard @xcite .    we should also mention that multi - baker models and the use of coarse gaining methods for calculating their entropy production have been criticized by rondoni and cohen@xcite . while some of their points are indisputably correct",
    ", their approach does not suggest a better way to proceed .",
    "so we continue this line of research in the expectation that it will lead to some further insights into entropy production in more realistic models , despite the shortcomings of the simplified models we treat here .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the ideas mentioned above , particularly those of gaspard @xcite and gilbert and dorfman @xcite , to a somewhat more complex model than those considered above .",
    "we consider a deterministic version of a persistent random walk in one dimension .",
    "the persistent random walk ( prw ) is similar to the usual random walk , but in this case the moving particle has both a position and velocity as it moves along a one dimensional lattice . at each lattice site",
    "the particle encounters a scatterer which , with probability @xmath2 allows the particle to continue in the direction of its velocity and with probability @xmath3 reverses the direction of the velocity .",
    "this model is a limiting version of a lorentz lattice gas described in detail by van velzen and ernst @xcite , where scatterers are distributed at random along the lattice sites with some overall density per site . in the persistent random walk ,",
    "the site density is unity .",
    "although this is clearly a random process , it can be turned into a deterministic one by a method described by dorfman , ernst , and jacobs @xcite , based upon the baker s transformation , whereby new variables are added to the system such that the dynamics in terms of these new variables allows us to replace the stochastic scattering mechanism by a deterministic one .",
    "a similar mechanism has also been considered by goldstein , lanford and lebowitz in a different context @xcite .",
    "further , we can place many particles on the lattice as long as they do not interact with each other and if we take each individual scattering event to be independent of any others taking place at the same instant of time .    here",
    "we will consider the prw in one dimension as a model for diffusion and entropy production , and we will describe the entropy production in terms of the additional phase space variables needed to make the system deterministic . that an irreversible entropy production is to be associated with this process follows from the fact that for systems with periodic boundary condiditons , any intitial variations in the probability of finding a particle at given positions will eventually vanish and the probability will become uniform with time .",
    "thus information is lost about the position of the particle and the entropy of the system is thereby increased .",
    "it is of some interest to see how this loss of information is reflected in the phase space distribution function , and how the entropy so produced is related to the entropy which is the subject of irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "we will see that the analysis of the prw model has some features that one hopes would be more general , such as the clear independence of the entropy production on the sizes of the coarse graining regions , provided these regions are not too small , and the coincidence of the production of the coarse grained gibbs entropy with the entropy production of irreversible thermodynamics , previously noted by gaspard , tvb and the present authors in multi - baker maps .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ bis ] gives a simple description of the phenomenological approach to entropy production in a simple one - dimensional diffusive system . in sec .",
    "[ ii ] , we describe in more detail the prw process . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] we describe a two - dimensional , measure preserving map that reproduces the prw on a macroscopic scale and discuss its time - reversal properties .",
    "we consider a system of non - interacting particles with a steady density gradient , produced by particle reservoirs at each end of the system .",
    "we then obtain the steady state invariant measure using techniques due to gaspard and tasaki @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] we develop a symbolic dynamics for the diffusion process , as it is refected in phase space , and , in sec .  [ v ] , we apply this symbolic dynamics to compute the rate of entropy production .",
    "we conclude with remarks and a discussion of open questions in sec .",
    "before turning to the description of the persistent random walk in sec .",
    "[ ii ] , we briefly discuss the phenomenological approach to entropy production in a one - dimensional system .",
    "let us consider a stochastic diffusive process that is driven away from equilibrium . more specifically , we have in mind a system where a gradient of density is imposed by appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "let the system be essentially one - dimensional by imposing translational invariance in the other spatial directions .",
    "the relevant spatial direction is denoted by @xmath4 @xmath5 at the boundaries , @xmath6 and @xmath7 we put particle reservoirs with respective particle densities @xmath8 and @xmath9 the reservoirs keep on feeding the system with new particles and those particles that exit never come back .",
    "the probability density of a tracer particle is @xmath10 and obeys the mass conservation law @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the associated current .    to follow the phenomenological approach of non - equilibrium thermodynamics",

    "( [ ovwss ] ) , the local rate of entropy production becomes @xmath30",
    "we consider the following process  : a particle on a one - dimensional lattice moves from site to site with a given velocity @xmath31 and , at each time step , is scattered forward with probability @xmath2 and backwards with probability @xmath32 such that @xmath33 . thus a particle located at site @xmath34 with velocity @xmath35 will move to @xmath36 conserving or reversing its velocity with the probabilities  : @xmath37 the diffusion coefficient for this process is @xcite @xmath38 to construct a deterministic model of this process , we start with a procedure similar to the one used by dorfman , ernst and jacobs @xcite , and consider the velocity of the particle only and associate to it a unit interval .",
    "let us divide the interval into two halves , corresponding to the two possible values of the velocity . for definiteness ,",
    "let us assign the first half to @xmath39 and the second to @xmath40 according to eq .",
    "( [ prwdef ] ) , a particle has a probability @xmath2 of keeping its velocity unchanged and @xmath41 to reverse it .",
    "therefore we have to further subdivide both halves into two parts of respective lengths @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the first of which must be mapped onto the same half and the second onto the other half . each of these branches must be linear and onto in order to model the independent process of velocity flips .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ figprwvmap ] ) for the case @xmath44 therefore a one - dimensional map whose dynamics mimics the random sequence of the velocities is given by @xmath45 the generalization of @xmath46 to a multi - baker map is straightforward  : @xmath47 this map is shown in fig([figprwmap ] ) .",
    "we note that if one restricts this map to a single unit square , by ignoring the changes in the site index , @xmath48 , this map is reversing under the time - reversal operators of the usual baker map @xmath49 and @xmath50 i.  e. @xmath51 however , the full multi - baker map , with the changes in the site index taken into account , reversing under either of these two time - reversal operators .",
    "indeed , one finds that , depending on @xmath52 and @xmath53 the composition @xmath54 and similarly for @xmath55 this is displayed in figs .",
    "( [ figprwtmtm]-[figprwsmsm ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that we can combine the action of @xmath56 and @xmath57 to form a hybrid operator @xmath58 that is reversing . indeed , as seen in fig .",
    "( [ figprwts ] ) , @xmath56 and @xmath57 act on the square in such a way that the images of the elements of the natural partition of the square under these two operators do not overlap .",
    "therefore @xmath59 defined by @xmath60 is a reversing operator for @xmath61 however , contrary to @xmath57 and @xmath62 @xmath58 is not an involution , i.e. @xmath63 and therefore @xmath58 is not necessarily a reversing symmetry of any power of @xmath61 actually @xmath64 is an involution , @xmath65 this implies that the conjugation of @xmath58 with odd powers of @xmath66 yields its inverse , while the conjugation with even powers leaves the map unchanged .",
    "in other words , @xmath58 is a reversing symmetry of @xmath67 for @xmath48 odd but a symmetry for @xmath48 even  : @xmath68 this property of a reversing operator can be contrasted with the existence of two reversing symmetries for the maps on the unit square , which itself implies the existence of a non - trivial symmetry , i.e. the composition of @xmath57 and @xmath55 those properties are well established @xcite , while the property described by eq .",
    "( [ prwumu ] ) is new , to our knowledge .",
    "the weakened reversibility of the map @xmath69 eq . ( [ prwumu ] ) , still allows the map to have a properly behaved dynamical entropy production as we will see in sec .",

    "the stationary measure is found by considering the following cumulative functions  : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the corresponding density function . because the map is piecewise uniformly expanding along the @xmath52 direction , the invariant measure is uniform along the @xmath52-direction and we therefore have @xmath74 where the functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 are solutions of the following set of equations  : @xmath77 with flux boundary conditions , @xmath78 the solutions of ( [ prweqcf ] ) for @xmath79 are readily found to be @xmath80 so that , for arbitrary @xmath81 , the solution takes the form @xmath82 where the class of functions @xmath83 is a one - parameter family , i.e. implicitly dependent on the scattering parameter @xmath41 , of generalized incomplete takagi functions , @xmath84 where @xmath85 and the boundary conditions on the functions @xmath86 are @xmath87 in fig .",
