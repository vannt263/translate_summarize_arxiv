    "we present an algorithm that takes as input a list @xmath0 of contracting similitudes in @xmath1 satisfying the strong separation condition ( see section [ section 2 ] ) and gives as output an estimate of the _ @xmath2-dimensional centered hausdorff measure _ , @xmath3 , of the self - similar set @xmath4 generated by @xmath5 . here @xmath2 is both the similarity and hausdorff dimension of @xmath4 and it can be computed from the contracting factors of the similitudes ( see ( [ dim ] ) ) . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first attempt at automatic computation of the exact value of a metric measure ( e.g. hausdorff , packing , spherical , centered , ... ) , a topic which has generated a considerable quantity of research ( @xcite , @xcite , jiazhouzhu , @xcite , , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc . )    the centered hausdorff measure is a variant of the hausdorff measure .",
    "these measures differ mainly in the natures of the coverings used in their definitions . in the case of the centered hausdorff measure we consider only covers by closed balls @xmath6 centered at points @xmath7 in",
    "the given set .",
    "the standard definition of @xmath8 on subsets of @xmath1 consists of two steps .",
    "given @xmath9 , we first compute the premeasure @xmath10 as @xmath11 because the suppression of good candidates for the @xmath7 s may cause an increase of the infimum , this premeasure is not monotone , although it is @xmath12additive ( see @xcite ) . in order to avoid this difficulty we define @xmath13the set function @xmath8 so obtained is a metric measure .",
    "it turns out that the centered hausdorff measure is bounded by constant multiples of the ordinary hausdorff measure ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely @xmath14 and so the centered hausdorff dimension and the ordinary hausdorff dimension coincide .",
    "in particular , for the self - similar set @xmath15 we have that @xmath16 .",
    "thus @xmath8 is a nice measure , but there remains the question of how to compute @xmath17 for some subset @xmath18 .",
    "a simplification comes from the following observation : for any borel set @xmath19 , @xmath20 where is @xmath21 the so called _ natural _ or _ empirical probability measure on @xmath4 .",
    "_ therefore , the problem of computing @xmath22 on @xmath4 reduces to computing @xmath23 .",
    "observe that the @xmath24measure of any open subset @xmath25 @xmath4 with boundary @xmath26 having null @xmath27measure ( and in particular of any open ball ) can be easily obtained with arbitrary accuracy and , hence , the @xmath28-measures of compact subsets of @xmath4 with @xmath24null boundaries can also be computed through their complements .",
    "this gives a vast class @xmath29 of borel sets with computable @xmath30measure . in turn , the @xmath31measure of any @xmath31measurable set can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy by the @xmath31measures of closed sets ( see * @xcite * theorem 1.6 b ) .",
    "how , then , to compute @xmath23 ? given the definitions , the task seems out of reach .",
    "the first obstruction comes from the need of the second step [ paso2 ] in the definition of @xmath8 .",
    "however , in @xcite it is proved that , for any subset @xmath32 of a self - similar set @xmath4 as above the measure and the premeasure coincide :    let @xmath32 be either a closed or an open subset of a self - similar set @xmath4 satisfying the open set condition . then @xmath33 .    with this result available , @xmath8 seems easier to compute than the hausdorff or spherical hausdorff measure .",
    "namely , the differences between these three measures are that , for the hausdorff measure , one optimizes among coverings by arbitrary convex sets ; for the spherical hausdorff measure one uses arbitrary balls ; and for @xmath34 one uses coverings by balls with centers in @xmath4 . for the hausdorff and the spherical hausdorff measures , the classes of available coverings are larger , and",
    "hence it is more difficult to find optimal coverings .    the second step which permits the computation of @xmath8",
    "was also given in @xcite .",
    "there it is proved that computing @xmath8 is equivalent to finding a centered ball with optimal inverse density :    [ tcentered ] suppose the invariant set @xmath4 of the system @xmath35 satisfies the open set condition , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and let @xmath21 be the normalized hausdorff measure on @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath38 moreover , if @xmath39  satisfies the ssc then @xmath40where @xmath41 and @xmath42    from now on , @xmath43 denotes the closed radius @xmath44 ball centered at @xmath45 .",
    "the statement ( [ censsc ] ) is crucial in our approach since it gives that if @xmath43 is a ball of maximal inverse density , then @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , to obtain the value of @xmath47 we need only to find an optimal ball and compute its density .",
    "this is precisely how the algorithm proceeds .",
    "it searches for balls that maximize the density function @xmath48 . actually , by _ the _ _ self - similar tiling principle _",
    "( see _ _",
    "@xcite _ _ ) , we know that finding an optimal ball is equivalent to finding an optimal covering .",
    "this is so because we can get an optimal covering tiling the set @xmath4 with balls of optimal density .",
    "@xmath4 may be tiled , without loss of @xmath28-measure , by tiles similar to a given tile @xmath49 . by similar we mean that the tile is an image of @xmath49 under a composition of similitudes in @xmath5 .",
    "the only condition to be imposed on @xmath49 is that it be closed and have @xmath50    our algorithm computes @xmath23 and provides an ( approximate ) ball of maximal density , together with an optimal covering of @xmath4 by balls centered at @xmath4 .",
    "now we describe the main steps of the algorithm .",
    "this is done rigorously in section  [ description ] . recall that the goal is to find the maximal value of @xmath48 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 $ ] ( see ( [ censsc ] ) ) . at step @xmath53 ,",
    "the set @xmath4 is replaced by a finite set of points @xmath54 such that @xmath55 and the measure @xmath28 is replaced by a discrete probability measure @xmath56 supported on @xmath57 and converging weakly to @xmath28 ( see ( [ muigulapto ] ) , ( [ mukdif ] ) and lemma  [ keylema ] ( iv ) ) .",
    "the objective now is to find the maximum of the discrete density function @xmath58 here @xmath59 stands for the euclidean distance .",
    "for each @xmath60 the algorithm searches for the maximal value of @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "once this has been found for every @xmath63 , the algorithm finds the maximum of these values with respect to @xmath64 .",
    "thus we only need to compute exactly @xmath65 for every @xmath66 . to this end",
    ", the points @xmath67 are listed in order of increasing distance to @xmath64 , and thus the points preceding a given point @xmath68 in the list always belong to the ball @xmath69 it is not hard to see that the exact value of @xmath70 is obtained from the place of @xmath68 in this list ( see ( [ mukigualball ] ) for the homogeneous case and ( [ mudifball ] ) for the general case ) .",
    "it remains to show that in the limit @xmath71 this process converges to @xmath47 .",
    "this is done in section  [ convergsec ] .",
    "the convergence is shown in two steps .",
    "first , by means of the markov operator @xmath72 associated to the set @xmath4 ( see section  [ preliminaries ] for notation and definitions ) , the measures @xmath73 are shown to converge weakly to the invariant measure @xmath28 .",
    "the basic properties of these measures yield a sequence of pairs of points @xmath74 such that @xmath75 .",
    "however , there is no reason why these @xmath76 should optimize @xmath77 .",
    "nonetheless , we are able to show that this holds asymptotically , which is enough for our purposes .",
    "an interesting technical point is that in the proofs an essential role is played by a result of mattila @xcite implying that @xmath78 .    in section  [ ejemplos ]",
    "we apply the algorithm to treat several sets whose centered hausdorff measures were available in the literature .",
    "it is remarkable that in all these cases the optimal value ( and also optimal ball and covering ) is attained at an early iteration .",
    "the algorithm also yields conjectural values ( which , in many cases , are upper bounds ) for sets whose measure is unknown .",
    "research is in progress to explore the rate of convergence and show that the method yields the precise values of @xmath47 .",
    "preliminary results seem to indicate that , for self - similar sets with less than four similarities , four decimal digits of accuracy are attainable by personal computers without any serious effort to optimize the code s design .",
    "let @xmath79 be a list of contracting similitudes on @xmath1 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
