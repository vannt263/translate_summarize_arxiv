    "an oscillatory medium experiencing a global coupling or feedback mechanism may evolve towards a domain - like structure called a cluster state , in which each domain oscillates uniformly with a defined phase difference to the others @xcite . several theoretical studies on nonlocally coupled oscillatory systems predicted a strange domain - type pattern , called a chimera state , where some domains are perfectly synchronized , but others oscillate spatially incoherently @xcite .",
    "chimera states might be of importance for some peculiar observations in different disciplines , such as the unihemispheric sleep of animals @xcite , the need for synchronized bumps in otherwise chaotic neuronal networks for signal propagation @xcite and the existence of turbulent - laminar patterns in a couette flow @xcite . very recently",
    ", the existence of chimera states could be validated in two pioneering experiments with chemical @xcite and optical oscillators @xcite . both experiments involved a specifically designed feedback algorithm to generate the specific nonlocal coupling .",
    "subsequently , chimera states could be realized in systems of mechanical @xcite and electrochemical @xcite oscillators",
    ". however , experimental evidence of the spontaneous formation of chimera states without the control from outside is still missing .    in this article",
    "we demonstrate , both theoretically and experimentally , that also under a strictly global coupling , if being nonlinear , a coexistence of synchrony and asynchrony can be found .",
    "we start with an ensemble of stuart - landau oscillators interacting solely via a nonlinear global coupling .",
    "an initially random distribution splits for given parameters into two groups , one being synchronized and the other one being desynchronized .",
    "we then discuss spatially extended oscillatory media .",
    "we show that a modified complex ginzburg - landau equation with nonlinear global coupling , originally proposed to explain special cluster patterns observed during the oscillatory electrooxidation of silicon in fluoride containing electrolytes @xcite , describes a transition from cluster patterns to a state with coexisting synchronized and incoherent domains . the results are indeed confirmed experimentally with the oscillating si - system , where the separation of the electrode into coherently and incoherently oscillating domains occurs spontaneously and without external feedback control .",
    "most remarkably , the incoherent region does not contain any amplitude defects .",
    "all these are essential properties of chimera states and we conclude that we have found a novel mechanism to this symmetry - breaking state .",
    "moreover , since a global coupling is frequently encountered , chimera states might exist in many more systems than anticipated so far .",
    "first , we consider an ensemble of @xmath0 stuart - landau oscillators @xcite under nonlinear global coupling    @xmath1    where @xmath2 $ ] labels each individual oscillator and @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote ensemble averages .",
    "the first term on the right hand side is the linear instability leading to oscillations , while their magnitudes are controlled by the cubic term .",
    "the last two terms represent the nonlinear global coupling . taking the ensemble average on both sides of eq .",
    "yields @xmath5 and thus @xmath6 , i.e. the average @xmath7 exhibits conserved harmonic oscillations with amplitude @xmath8 and frequency @xmath9 . as we will see later , this conservation law strongly influences the dynamics .",
    "altogether we have three parameters , namely @xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "we numerically solved eq .",
    "( for details see the appendix ) . starting from a random distribution , for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "the ensemble splits into two groups as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sl_chimera ] , where we show the real parts of @xmath15 for all oscillators .",
    "one group is synchronized ( red , light gray ) and the other group is desynchronized ( blue , dark gray ) .",
    "the synchronized oscillators perform collective and nearly harmonic oscillations , while the asynchronous ones exhibit incoherent and irregular motions .",
    "although the oscillations of this latter group present a seemingly regular spiking , the oscillators in this group are strongly uncorrelated both in time and in their simultaneous amplitudes and phases .",
    "we observe strong amplitude fluctuations in the incoherent group , as this is also the case for chimeras found in a nonlocally coupled system in a parameter region , where the weak - coupling approximation does not apply @xcite .",
    "no interchange of oscillators between the two groups occurs .",
    "the regularity of the spiking can be explained by a second time - scale inherent in the system . as discussed for the continuous system in @xcite , in the parameter regime , where clustering occurs",
    ", the nonlinear global coupling leads to two dominant time - scales : the frequency @xmath9 of the oscillation of the spatial average and a frequency , which may be called the cluster frequency .",
    "the contribution to the oscillations in the two phases at this cluster frequency show a phase shift of @xmath16 ( between the two phases ) .",
    "the time - scale of the regular spiking in fig .",
    "[ fig : sl_chimera ] is given by the cluster frequency described above as the clustering mechanism leads to the separation into the two groups .",
    "interestingly , chimera states found in an electrochemical experiment with individual electrodes arranged on a ring and coupled nonlocally exhibit a similar spiking behaviour : the desynchronized oscillating elements drift some time with the mean - field , interrupted by fast @xmath17 phase slips @xcite .     for all oscillators",
    "are shown .",
    "the synchronized oscillators ( red , light gray ) perform collective and nearly harmonic oscillations , while the asynchronous oscillators ( blue , dark gray ) exhibit incoherent and irregular dynamics . for parameters see text.,width=283 ]    in essence we have found the coexistence of synchrony and asynchrony , i.e. a kind of a chimera state , evolving under a solely global coupling .",
    "this contradicts the assumption that a nonlocal coupling is indispensable for the occurrence of these states .",
    "contrarily to the findings in @xcite , the chimera state is stable independently of the population size and forms spontaneously @xcite from a random distribution .",
    "the co - existing synchronized state is unstable , which is also the case for the chimera states described in @xcite and in @xcite . in the latter work it is argued , that this is connected with strong fluctuations of the amplitude in the incoherent region , as they did not consider the weak - coupling limit .",
    "the type of chimera states found here are absent under linear global coupling @xcite .",
    "note , however , that linear global coupling may induce other types of chimera states , also in an ensemble of stuart - landau oscillators involving large amplitude variations @xcite , or in a globally coupled map lattice @xcite .",
    "the former state is also found in our model , eq .  , and will be discussed elsewhere .      in order to describe experiments on an spatially extended oscillatory medium , we consider now a modified complex ginzburg - landau equation ( mcgle ) @xcite ,    @xmath18    here @xmath19 is the complex order parameter describing the dynamical state at each point @xmath20 at time @xmath21 and @xmath22 now denotes the spatial average .",
    "the original complex ginzburg - landau equation without the nonlinear global coupling is a generic model for systems at the onset of oscillations and has a wide range of applications @xcite .",
    "the mcgle , eq .  , was proposed to explain experimental results of the electrooxidation of @xmath23-si(111 ) under illumination @xcite .",
    "in fact , the emergence of subharmonic cluster patterns in the oxide - layer thickness at the silicon - electrolyte interface can successfully be described by eq .",
    "an important experimentally observed feature is a nearly harmonic oscillation of the spatially averaged oxide - layer thickness .",
    "this is captured by the conservation law for the homogeneous mode @xmath24 in the theory @xcite .",
    "we numerically solved eq .",

    "let us call the two phases a and b , respectively . simulations show that the system evolves according to a minimization of the interface between a and b. this leads to a demixing of the phases . as the diffusional coupling between a and b acts only near the boundaries , for large domain sizes it can be neglected . under this assumption , the dynamics in each phase",
    "is governed by    @xmath35    where x = a , b and @xmath36 is the coupling between a and b and has to be determined . exploiting the conservation law for the homogeneous mode one finds    @xmath37    we can further write for the spatial averages over phases a and b @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 . with the phase difference @xmath42 between a and b",
    ", one can now show that the intra - group coupling differs from the inter - group coupling .",
    "note that @xmath43 is generally unequal to @xmath16 as we are dealing with subharmonic two - phase clusters @xcite .",
    "one obtains in terms of @xmath44    @xmath45    we see that phases a and b experience each a different influence from the intra- and inter - group couplings . this is not due to a difference in coupling strength defined a priori , but is the result of the intrinsic dynamics causing the phase difference . as studies of two subpopulations in refs .",
    "@xcite with global intra- and inter - group couplings of different strength show the existence of chimera states , we conclude that the similar situation arising here renders the emergence of chimeras possible .",
    "the coupling can be tuned with the parameter @xmath10 , where the influence is different on inter- and intra - group coupling if @xmath43 depends also on @xmath10 , which is a reasonable assumption .    as presented in fig .",

    "[ fig : w_real]c .",
    "all these states were also found in ref .",
    "@xcite , but there the two subpopulations were man - made and the system had to be initialized in a special manner .",
    "in contrast , in our case , the system splits spontaneously into the two groups .    to further illustrate the characteristics of the chimera state",

    "the system investigated is the photoelectrochemical dissolution of n - type doped silicon in fluoride containing electrolytes . here",
    "the silicon sample is oxidized electrochemically via the following dominant reaction @xcite :    @xmath48    where ( @xmath49 ) represents the number of charge - carriers transferred through valence - band processes and @xmath50 the number of charge - carriers transferred through conduction - band processes .",
    "the second reaction is solely chemical , i.e. no charge - carriers are transferred for the reaction .",
    "it has to be noted that the initial charge transfer is always a valence - band process rendering illumination necessary for the reaction to occur at n - type doped silicon samples .",
    "the illumination also limits the total current , which is a likely source of the non - linear global coupling @xcite .",
    "the generated oxide is etched away by the fluoride species present in the electrolyte , e.g. hf @xcite , in another solely chemical process :    @xmath51    as silicon oxidation and the etching of silicon oxide have opposite effects on the oxide - layer thickness , a steady state can be reached for suitable experimental conditions . already in the 1950s",
    "it was found that the system can also be oscillatory , which has drawn a lot of attention since then ( for a review see chapter 5 in ref .",

    "<S> the key aspect is that nonidentical oscillating elements , as nature is never perfect , with a distribution of natural frequencies become synchronized due to the mutual coupling . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in 2002 _ kuramoto & battogtokh _ @xcite found the opposite phenomenon : a perfect symmetric system of identical oscillators coupled via a nonlocal coupling ( i.e. a coupling that somehow decreases with the distance between two oscillators ) may undergo a transition to a state , where a synchronized group of oscillators coexists with an unsynchronized one . </S>",
    "<S> this situation was later named chimera state , since the chimera was , according to greek mythology , composed of the parts of different animals . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocality of the coupling is believed to be indispensable for the formation of chimera states . however , in the present article we show that this is a misbelief , as we found chimera states under solely global coupling . </S>",
    "<S> global coupling means that each individual oscillator couples to the mean field of all oscillators . in our case </S>",
    "<S> the mean field is a nonlinear function of the state variables of each oscillator . </S>",
