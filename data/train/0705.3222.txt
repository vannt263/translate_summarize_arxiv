    "@xmath1 for probes in bsa solutions complies with this dependence if bsa is assigned an effective @xmath4 corresponding to its radius .",

    "the focus is the application of these techniques to colloidal particles in solution .",
    "many methods have been applied to study the motion of mesoscopic probe particles through polymer solutions , including qelss , frs , frap , dws , particle tracking , and interferometry .",
    "optical probe methods refer to a special case of scattering from a general three - component probe : matrix polymer : solvent system . in the special case , one of the components , the _ probe _ ,",
    "is dilute yet nonetheless dominates the scattering process , even though the other solute component , the _ matrix _ , may be far more concentrated than the probe .",

    "however , a non - exponential @xmath13 can also arise from systems in which @xmath49 has more complex behavior .",
    "it is impossible to distinguish these possibilities by examining spectra taken at a single scattering angle or from spectra uniformly averaged over a range of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , it is impossible to determine @xmath50 from one light scattering spectrum of an unknown system .",
    "recently , a misinterpretation of the historical literature on light scattering spectra has emerged .",
    "the starting point is the excellent book of berne and pecora@xcite , in particular their treatment of light scattering spectra of brownian particles that follow the langevin equation .",
    "berne and pecora s treatment is without error , but the restrictions on the range of validity of their results are not uniformly recognized .    the langevin equation is a model for an isolated particle floating in a simple solvent .",
    "the particle is assumed to be subject to two forces , namely a drag force @xmath51 and a random force @xmath52 .",
    "here @xmath53 is the drag coefficient and @xmath54 is the time - dependent particle velocity .",
    "the random force is uncorrelated with the drag force . also",
    ", the random forces at any distinct pair of times are uncorrelated , i.e. , @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "the particle s motion follows from newton s second law .",
    "the model only specifies statistical properties of @xmath52 , so only statistical properties of particle displacements can be obtained from the langevin model .    under these conditions ,",
    "doob@xcite showed in 1942 that : ( i ) @xmath57 is a gaussian in @xmath58 , with mean - square displacement in one dimension satisfying @xmath59 ; ( ii ) the spectrum reduces to @xmath60 and ( iii ) as an absolutely rigorous mathematical consequence , @xmath13 is a single exponential , namely @xmath61 .",
    "these results describe , e.g. , the light scattering spectrum of dilute polystyrene spheres in pure water , which was an early target for experimental studies .",
    "spectra of probe particles in viscoelastic fluids commonly are not simple exponentials . in the literature misinterpretation , eq .  [ eq : sqtaureduceddp ] is incorrectly claimed  under the cognomen gaussian assumption or gaussian approximationto be uniformly applicable to light scattering spectra , in particular to spectra that do not show a single - exponential decay .",
    "is this realistic ? in a viscoelastic liquid , the elastic moduli are frequency - dependent .",
    "correspondingly , the stress fluctuations in the liquid create random forces with non - zero correlation times , i.e. , @xmath62 for a range of @xmath63 .",
    "correspondingly , the displacement distribution function is not a gaussian , and @xmath64 shows non - diffusive behavior @xmath65 that is not characterized by a diffusion coefficient . a contrapositive statement of doob s theorem shows that non - exponential spectra correspond necessarily to particles",

    "<S> the experimental literature on the motion of mesoscopic probe particles through polymer solutions is systematically reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> the primary focus is the study of diffusive motion of small probe particles . </S>",
    "<S> comparison is made with measurements of solution viscosities . </S>",
    "<S> a coherent description was obtained , namely that the probe diffusion coefficient generally depends on polymer concentration as @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that @xmath1 depends on polymer molecular weights as @xmath2 , and @xmath3 appears to have large-@xmath4 and small-@xmath4 values with a crossover linking them . </S>",
    "<S> the probe diffusion coefficient does not simply track the solution viscosity ; instead , @xmath5 typically increases markedly with increasing polymer concentration and molecular weight . in some systems , e.g. , hydroxypropylcellulose : water , the observed probe spectra are bi- or tri - modal . </S>",
    "<S> extended analysis of the full probe phenomenology implies that hydroxypropylcellulose solutions are characterized by a single , concentration - independent , length scale that is approximately the size of a polymer coil . in a very few systems , </S>",
    "<S> one sees re - entrant or low - concentration - plateau behaviors of uncertain interpretation ; from their rarity , these behaviors are reasonably interpreted as corresponding to specific chemical effects . </S>",
    "<S> true microrheological studies examining the motion of mesoscopic particles under the influence of a known external force are also examined . </S>",
    "<S> viscosity from true microrheological measurements is in many cases substantially smaller than the viscosity measured with a macroscopic instrument . </S>"
