    "in this section , we present the requirements for implementing ptai , discuss its applicability to alkali atoms , and describe our implementation of the technique using optically trapped sodium bose - einstein condensates .",

    "we assume that the atoms are initially in the atomic ground state , @xmath0 , from which a fraction of atoms can be transferred to the auxiliary state @xmath1 .",
    "the state @xmath1 connects via an optical cycling transition to the excited state @xmath2 for imaging .",
    "the lifetime of @xmath1 must exceed imaging timescales .    in the likely case that @xmath0 couples to a state ( or states ) @xmath3 , the energy difference between the two transitions , @xmath4 , should be large enough so that the imaging light does not cause off - resonant excitation of atoms in @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the natural linewidth of the @xmath7 transition .",
    "ptai is well suited ( but not limited ) to imaging in optical dipole traps , which in contrast to magnetic traps , produce no spatially varying zeeman shift that could affect the uniformity of the transfer@xcite .",
    "such traps are often shallow enough that the scattering of several photons transfers enough energy and momentum that the atoms leave the trap in the direction of propagation of the imaging beam .",

    "alkali metal atoms are used extensively in atomic physics , in part because their atomic structure allows for straightforward laser cooling .",
    "their hyperfine structure also makes them suitable for employing ptai .",
    "the s@xmath14 ground state of alkali atoms has two hyperfine levels .",
    "atoms can be coherently transferred between these two states using microwave or optical raman transitions .",
    "alkali atoms have the d@xmath8 optical transition to the p@xmath16 state , which allows for at least one cycling transition from the s@xmath14 hyperfine state . for example , in sodium ( see fig .  [ hyperfine]b ) , one scheme would be to assign @xmath0=@xmath103 @xmath11s@xmath12f=1@xmath13 , @xmath1=@xmath103 @xmath11s@xmath12f=2@xmath13 , and @xmath2=@xmath103 @xmath11p@xmath15f=3@xmath13 , thereby using the cycling transition from the upper s@xmath14 hyperfine state .",

    "if there is some off - resonant excitation from @xmath1 to some state @xmath17 that decays to some state other than @xmath1 , or if @xmath18 is not a perfect cycling transition , and @xmath2 has a decay branch to states other than @xmath1 , the transferred fraction will eventually be optically pumped out of the cycling transition to another state@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one can still use ptai if a sufficient number of photons can be scattered before optical pumping ( discussed in section  [ sec : uncertaintyod ] ) .    for either choice of @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 states in the d@xmath8 transition ,",
    "the other states in the p@xmath16 hyperfine manifold are potential @xmath3 and @xmath17 excited states that may affect the ptai process via off - resonant excitation .",
    "the large energy splitting of the s@xmath14 hyperfine states typically ensures that @xmath5 for all @xmath3 states , and there is negligible @xmath7 off - resonant excitation .",
    "although there is typically some @xmath19 off - resonant excitation , for many atomic species , the rate of optical pumping to @xmath0 is low enough to use ptai .",
    "notable exceptions are lithium and some isotopes of potassium , which have relatively close - spaced excited levels ( @xmath20 ) .    in section [ sec : caseexamples ] , we illustrate ptai experimentally using @xmath9na ( fig .",

    "optical pumping due to off - resonant excitation from the f=2 state to the f=1,2 states ( @xmath17 ) followed by decay to f=1 state is low enough to allow the technique to be used .",
    "to illustrate the scope of the technique , we present examples of ptai in two specific situations that have been chosen to highlight different advantages of the technique .",

    "( e ) azimuthal column density profiles inferred from the ptai ( black line ) and absorption ( red line ) images ( angles shown in ( d ) ) .",
    "the ptai image has been rescaled based on the known transfer fraction . due to the severe attenuation of the probe ( seen in ( a ) , ( c ) ) , the absorption image fails to show the true od of the cloud ( see ( e ) ) and consequently , spatial features such as the azimuthal density variation are suppressed and are disproportionately affected by shot noise ( discussed in section [ sec : noise ] ) . in contrast , the ptai image shows clear spatial features , particularly the density variations due to azimuthal inhomogeneities of the toroidal potential .",
    "all images are 85 @xmath24 m @xmath25 85 @xmath24 m .",
    "there are small ( @xmath26% ) additional corrections for saturation of the transition ( both images ) and optical pumping ( ptai image only ) .",
    "these corrections have not been made , but would not affect the overall shape of plots shown in ( e ) . ]",
    "ptai uses the same optical setup and probe detuning as standard absorption imaging , allowing one to easily switch between the two .",
    "in contrast , for pci , one needs to detune the probe far from resonance and insert an optical element such as a phase - spot  @xcite or a linear polarizer  @xcite to produce an interference that allows detection of the phase shift .",
    "the ease of switching between standard absorption and ptai is advantageous in situations where for example , one may need to image a high od cloud _ in situ _ and a low od cloud in time - of - flight  @xcite , possibly even within the same experimental run . in a recent experiment  @xcite",
    ", we created condensates in a ring - shaped trap .",
    "the cloud had an on - resonance od of up to 20 making it unsuitable for absorption imaging _ in - situ _ ( shown in fig .",

    ".      creating an ultracold gas sample takes anywhere from the order of a second to the order of a minute ( for the experiments described here , it is around 30 s ) .",
    "conditions may vary from sample to sample causing fluctuations in the number of atoms and consequently other properties such as the condensate fraction .",
    "typically , the creation of the ultracold gas sample is just the starting point of a more complicated experiment .",
    "although it is possible to average over many experimental realizations to overcome the fluctuations in the initial sample , it is easier to make a minimally - destructive measurement of the initial sample and normalize appropriately .",
    "this kind of procedure is used to study , for example , photoassociation  @xcite or feshbach resonances  @xcite .    in order to compensate for the initial fluctuations , the uncertainty in the measurement has to be smaller than those fluctuations . in one example of this procedure",
    ", we have used ptai to compensate for atom number fluctuations to obtain a more precise measurement of the lifetime of a bec in a trap .",
    "although here we have discussed normalization of atom number , one can also use a ptai image to compensate for other fluctuations such as changes in the shape and position of the sample  @xcite , for example to measure trap oscillations  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we derive the measurement uncertainty of ptai using a model calculation and simplifying assumptions .",
    "we take the relative uncertainty of the measured od to be the important figure of merit and compare this uncertainty for ptai and pci for clouds of various ods .      in order to examine the measurement uncertainty , we first set up a generalized formalism to analyze the ptai process .",
    "the transmitted probe beam is imaged on a ccd , which consists of a two - dimensional array of pixels ( photosensors ) .",
    "each pixel on the ccd receives probe light transmitted through a specific area of the ultracold gas cloud . for simplicity , we assume that the optical resolution is better than our pixel size and hence can be ignored for this analysis .",
    "similarly , we assume that the imaging depth of field is larger than the relevant cloud dimension and does not affect the measurement .",
    "the measurement uncertainty depends in part on the pixel size , and is ultimately determined by shot noise .",
    "one can use a larger pixel size ( by binning over adjacent pixels or reducing the optical magnification ) to lower shot noise at the expense of spatial resolution .    in the following analysis",
    ", we consider a part of the cloud with cross - section area @xmath27 , containing @xmath28 atoms ( see fig .",

    "an average of @xmath30 photons are incident on the imaging area @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath31 photons are transmitted through this area and ultimately fall on a single effective pixel , which is our detector .",
    "we assume that the probe intensity , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the frequency of the light , is much lower than the saturation intensity of the transition .",
    "the probe time @xmath29 is short enough that atoms are assumed stationary ( i.e. they move a small distance compared to @xmath34 , due to the velocity imparted to the atoms by recoil from absorption and emission of photons ) .",
    "we assume a single detection efficiency coefficient @xmath35 for the imaging system , which includes both the transmission efficiency of the optical beam path to the ccd and the quantum efficiency of the detector .",
    "we also assume that the detector is shot noise limited .    for the probe pulse of frequency @xmath33 , imaging on a cycling transition with resonance frequency @xmath36 , and linewidth @xmath37 , we define a normalized detuning @xmath38 .",
    "we ignore broadening from other effects , which are typically negligible compared to @xmath37 for ultracold gases .",
    "the ( on - resonant ) od of the area of interest is given by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the resonant scattering cross - section .",
    "we assume that the atom cloud density varies slowly over distances on the order of the wavelength of the light , and obtain@xcite : @xmath41 \\label{eq : absorption } , \\\\",

    "for ptai , imaging is best done on resonance ( @xmath44 ) for which there is no phase shift ( @xmath43=0 ) .",
    "in using the ptai technique , we transfer a chosen fraction of atoms , @xmath45 , corresponding to an average transferred od of @xmath46 , and number @xmath47 . in this calculation",
    ", we assume that atoms are neither optically pumped out of the cycling transition nor mechanically pushed out of @xmath27 during the imaging process . in practice , this puts a limit on the number of incident photons @xmath30 , which will be discussed later in this section . with this description",
    ", we can now proceed to calculate the uncertainty of the measurement .",
    "shot noise limits the precision of ptai in two ways , the photon shot noise of the light and the quantum projection noise of the transferred atoms .",
    "the detector photon count depends on the light transmitted through the sample , @xmath48 and the detection efficiency , @xmath35 .",
    "the photon shot noise @xmath49 of the beam is given by the square - root of the mean number of detected photons : @xmath50 where we have taken @xmath44 .",
    "we view the partial transfer as placing each atom in the cloud in a coherent superposition of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the imaging pulse collapses the superposition into an incoherent mixture .",
    "the fluctuations from this quantum projection give a standard deviation of @xmath51 for a small transfer fraction @xmath45 of @xmath28 atoms .",

    "however , when @xmath594 , changes in @xmath55 produce little change in the transmitted intensity because the probe is almost completely absorbed , a feature not accounted for by considering the s / n of @xmath42 .",
    "we therefore choose the fractional uncertainty in the measured od @xmath55 as the metric for the quality of the image , which we will now derive by propagating @xmath60 through the image analysis .      in determining the fractional uncertainty of @xmath55 ,",
    "an important consideration is the effect of optical pumping , which transfers atoms out of the cycling transition ( @xmath1@xmath2 ) . to minimize optical pumping effects",

    "@xmath62 is species specific , depending on the atomic states that contribute to optical pumping and the transition probabilities associated with those states .",

    ", increasing @xmath45 improves the signal and therefore lowers the fractional uncertainty .",
    "the latter limit corresponds to a transferred cloud that is optically thick , where the transmitted probe is nearly extinguished , causing the measurement to be limited by photon shot noise . here",

    "this expression is valid only for small @xmath45 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ptdbrsimpl ] ) highlights the minimally - destructive nature of ptai , where the uncertainty in measurement decreases with increasing perturbation ( @xmath45 ) to the sample and as expected , is the inverse of the square root of the number of atoms lost .",
    "standard absorption imaging using low intensities of probe light can also be used as a minimally - destructive technique  @xcite . to see the benefits of ptai over absorption imaging ( in this minimally - destructive regime ) , we make a comparison of the two . following a procedure similar to that of the previous section , we obtain : @xmath74 where @xmath75 , the fraction of atoms that undergo photon recoil due to absorption , is a measure of the perturbation to the sample by the imaging process  @xcite .",
    "this expression differs from equation ( [ eq : ptdbr ] ) in that it is completely dependent on the photon shot noise .    in the low @xmath46 limit , where ptai is also photon shot noise limited ( @xmath76 ) , equation ( [ eq : ptdbr ] ) can be simplified : @xmath77 this fractional uncertainty is identical to the corresponding expression in the low @xmath55 limit for ( minimally - destructive ) standard absorption imaging , @xmath78 except for a factor of @xmath79 , which arises due to the use of the cycling transition in ptai and allows one to scatter many photons per atom .",

    "<S> partial - transfer absorption imaging is a tool that enables optimal imaging of atomic clouds for a wide range of optical depths . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to standard absorption imaging , the technique can be minimally - destructive and can be used to obtain multiple successive images of the same sample . </S>",
    "<S> the technique involves transferring a small fraction of the sample from an initial internal atomic state to an auxiliary state and subsequently imaging that fraction absorptively on a cycling transition . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms remaining in the initial state are essentially unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the technique , discuss its applicability , and compare its performance as a minimally - destructive technique to that of phase - contrast imaging .    since the realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec )  @xcite , and later fermi degeneracy  @xcite , in dilute atomic gases </S>",
    "<S> , the field of ultracold gases has expanded rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> while the properties of ultracold gases are still undergoing active research , such gases are also used as tools to study a wide variety of phenomena , including those traditionally explored in condensed matter physics  @xcite . even though experiments are becoming increasingly complex and often require ever - more - sensitive optical imaging , the standard approaches to imaging remain essentially unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> standard imaging techniques work _ optimally _ for a limited range of cloud densities . here </S>",
    "<S> we describe and analyze a technique , partial - transfer absorption imaging ( ptai ) , which was recently demonstrated  @xcite , and present data illustrating the utility of this technique . </S>",
    "<S> ptai enables the optimal imaging of clouds of almost any optical depth ( od ) . </S>",
    "<S> the flexibility of ptai , combined with ease of use , makes it an important tool for imaging ultracold gases .    in choosing an imaging technique for an ultracold atomic cloud , </S>",
    "<S> one traditionally has three options : absorption , fluorescence or phase - contrast imaging . </S>",
    "<S> resonant imaging techniques , such as absorption and fluorescence imaging , exploit the strong interaction of ultracold gases with laser light . in these techniques , </S>",
    "<S> the scattering of photons by the atoms leads to heating and destruction of the sample , typically allowing only one image to be taken per sample . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , resonant absorption imaging can not be used for optically thick ( high column density ) clouds , due to extinction of the imaging probe beam , which leads to loss of spatial and number information . </S>",
    "<S> modifications such as imaging off - resonance , or imaging after expanding the cloud in time - of - flight , can overcome this limitation , but make reconstructing the original cloud profile more difficult . </S>",
    "<S> fluorescence imaging works similarly to absorption imaging , but detects the scattered photons from the cloud instead of the transmitted probe beam . </S>",
    "<S> however , the solid angles for collecting fluorescent light are typically restricted , making it less effective , except in the case of very low optical depth  @xcite ( column density ) .    phase - contrast imaging </S>",
    "<S> ( pci )  @xcite and other dispersive techniques  @xcite are typically used to image clouds of high ( on - resonant ) ods . such techniques use off - resonant probe light to avoid extinction of the beam and detect the phase shift due to the atom - light interaction in the transmitted probe beam . since the scattering cross - section is reduced by imaging off - resonance , </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation to the sample is typically small ( _ i.e. _ minimally - destructive ) , allowing the cloud to be imaged multiple times . </S>",
    "<S> pci is typically not used for imaging clouds of low od as it gives a weak signal .    using ptai , </S>",
    "<S> one retains the advantages of absorption imaging for optically thin clouds while also being able to image optically thick clouds , without losing spatial and atom number information . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , as with pci , ptai can be minimally - destructive and allows for multiple images of the same sample . in this technique , </S>",
    "<S> a fraction of the atoms are transferred to an auxiliary internal state that has a cycling transition , and then resonantly imaged . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms remaining in the original state are virtually transparent to the probe light . </S>",
    "<S> the recoil momentum imparted by many scattered photons from the imaging light cause the transferred cloud to be ejected from the trap . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining atoms , being transparent , are essentially unperturbed , stay trapped , and can subsequently be re - imaged .    ptai is advantageous over pci in that the degree of perturbation of the sample can be more easily varied , even for successive images of the same sample . </S>",
    "<S> this is useful in situations where the od of the atomic cloud is changing significantly as a function of time or of the number of images . </S>",
    "<S> an example is measuring loss processes , such as when characterizing feshbach resonances  @xcite or efimov states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ptai could also be particularly useful for studying _ in situ _ dynamics of quasi two - dimensional condensates where the cloud od in the tightly confined direction may not be high enough to obtain a good phase - contrast image @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> any measurement on an ultracold sample perturbs it . in a minimally - destructive imaging technique , there is a trade - off between the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and the perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in pci , decreasing the probe light detuning improves the s / n but also causes more absorption and therefore greater perturbation to the system  @xcite . in ptai , one transfers a certain number of atoms to the auxiliary state according to the desired s / n . </S>",
    "<S> one can then scatter as many photons from the transferred atoms as one wants without causing any additional perturbation . as an aside </S>",
    "<S> , we note that standard resonant absorption imaging might also be made minimally - destructive  @xcite by lowering the amount of incident light so that less than one photon per atom is scattered on average ( see section [ comparison_abs ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> recently freilich _ _ et al.__@xcite used ptai to transfer atoms to an untrapped state from a magnetically trapped bec . </S>",
    "<S> since the focus of that work was to study vortex dynamics that had spatial features too small to see _ in situ _ , the atomic distributions were imaged after expansion in time - of - flight . in this article , we focus on using ptai to obtain an accurate minimally - destructive image of the _ in situ _ density profile . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we study its scope and usefulness , making quantitative comparisons with pci . </S>",
    "<S> there have been several other approaches used to address the limitations of standard imaging techniques  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , such schemes have typically been destructive and could not be used to take multiple images .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : imaging ] , we discuss the technique and its applicability . in section [ sec : caseexamples ] , we present a demonstration of the technique . in section [ sec : noise ] , we discuss noise and uncertainty in the measurement and compare the performance of the technique to pci as a minimally - destructive imaging technique . </S>"
