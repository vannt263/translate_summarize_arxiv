    "non - abelian solitons play an important role in gauge theories of elementary particle physics @xcite .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to study gravitating gauge fields .",
    "the first example of gravitating non - abelian solitons was discovered by bartnik and mckinnon in the four - dimensional einstein - yang - mills theory for the gauge group su(2 ) @xcite . soon after the bk discovery it was realized that , apart from solitons , the einstein - yang - mills model also contains non - abelian black holes @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the su(3 ) branch of similar solutions exists also .",
    "such solutions can be thought of as eigenstates of non - linear eigenvalue problems , which accounts for the discreteness of some their parameters .",
    "the most surprising fact here is the existence of the bartnik - mckinnon particles , which have not any analogue in flat space . from the physical point of view",
    "it proceeds from the fact that the classical yang - mills equations have not any topologically trivial regular solutions .",
    "in fact , it is connected with the confinement problem in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the standard opinion will be that _ only _ quantized su(3 ) gauge field may form regular objects , for example , a hypothesized flux tube connecting two interacting quarks .",
    "however , it is known @xcite that in such sourceless non  abelian gauge theories have no classical glueballs @xcite which otherwise would be an indication for the occurrence of confinement in the quantized theory .",
    "the reason simply is that nearby small portions of the yang",
    " mills fields always point at the same direction in internal space and therefore must repel each other as similar charges .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate gravitating quantum non - abelian gauge fields . the main problem here is to describe quantum non - abelian gauge fields in a non - perturbative manner . in ref .",
    "@xcite is offered an approximate non - perturbative approach to quantization of su(3 ) gauge field .",
    "it is shown that using some assumptions and approximations one can reduce the su(3 ) lagrangian to the lagrangian describing two interacting scalar fields .",
    "thus , in this letter we will investigate a boson star filled with two interacting scalar fields which can be considered as a gauge condensate .",
    "the boson star was first discovered theoretically by kaup @xcite and by ruffini and bonazzola @xcite ( for reviewing the boson star , see refs.@xcite and @xcite , and other references are cited therein ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the boson star is considered filled with the complex doublet of scalar fields coupled to an su(2 ) non - abelian gauge field .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the emission spectrum from a simple accretion disk model around a compact object is compared with the cases of a black hole and a boson star . it was found that , for certain values of the boson star parameters , it is possible to produce spectra similar to those which are generated when the central object is a black hole .",
    "one can say that the presented here solution is a quantum su(3 ) version of the bartnik - mckinnon particle - like solution .",
    "let us consider einstein gravity interacting with two scalar fields @xmath0 .",
    "the metric is @xmath1 dt^2 -       \\displaystyle \\frac{e^{\\nu(r)}}{1 + \\displaystyle \\frac{m(r)}{r } } dr^2 -       r^2 \\left (          d \\theta^2 + \\sin^2 \\theta d \\varphi^2      \\right ) , \\label{sec2 - 10}\\ ] ] the lagrangian for scalar fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 is @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "the potential @xmath6 is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the constant which can be considered as a cosmological constant @xmath9 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that these scalar fields present a quantum gauge field . in short",
    "it can be shown by the following way . in quantizing strongly interacting su(3 ) gauge fields - via heisenberg s non - perturbative method @xcite one first replaces the classical fields by field operators @xmath10 .",
    "this yields the following differential equations for the operators @xmath11 where @xmath12 ; @xmath13 are su(3 ) color indices .",
    "these nonlinear equations for the field operators of the nonlinear quantum fields can be used to determine expectation values for the field operators @xmath14 .",
    "one problem in using these equations in order to obtain expectation values like @xmath15 , is that these equations involve not only powers or derivatives of @xmath15 ( _ i.e. _ terms like @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) but also contain terms like @xmath18 . starting with eq .",
    "one can generate an operator differential equation for the product @xmath19 consequently allowing the determination of the green s function @xmath20 @xmath21 however this equation will in it s turn contain other , higher order green s functions . repeating these steps leads to an infinite set of equations connecting green s functions of ever increasing order .",
    "this construction , leading to an infinite set of coupled , differential equations , does not have an exact , analytical solution and so must be handled using some approximation . the basic approach in this case is to give some physically reasonable scheme for cutting off the infinite set of equations for the green s functions .",
    "using some assumptions and approximations on 2- and 4-points green s functions one can reduce the initial su(3 ) lagrangian to an effective lagrangian describing two interacting scalar fields ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the scalar fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 which are under discussion here appear in the following way .",
    "we assume that in the first approximation two points green s functions can be calculated as follows @xmath22 where @xmath23 ; @xmath24 are spatial indices . and @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
