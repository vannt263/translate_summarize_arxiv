    "suspensions of non - brownian particles were recently shown to flow irreversibly when subjected to sufficiently high , uniform oscillatory strain @xcite even at low reynolds number ( stokes flows ) .",
    "the significance of this phenomenon is enhanced by the fact that time reversibility is one of the most basic symmetries of physics , and stokes flows have long been used to demonstrate hydrodynamic reversibility .",
    "furthermore , a distinct threshold strain amplitude was found above which particles fail to return to their original positions upon flow reversal .",
    "this system provides one of the few confirmed examples of a non - equilibrium phase transition @xcite .",
    "since suspensions are an important class of fluids in chemical , biological , and industrial applications , the appearance of complex dynamics in such flows is significant .",
    "these experiments have led to a number of theoretical works aimed at explaining the non - equilibrium phase transition @xcite .",
    "random , irreversible particle interactions provide a mechanism for particle self - organization , which leads to a divergent relaxation time at the onset of irreversibility .",
    "similarities have been demonstrated between this transition and plastic depinning phenomena @xcite .",
    "uniformly sheared particle suspensions can also exhibit self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite when random interactions and gravitational settling compete .",
    "it has not yet been determined how irreversible particle motion develops in suspension flows that are strained inhomogeneously , a far more general situation . in this paper",
    ", we consider the onset of irreversible behavior for dense suspensions ( 40% by volume ) in an oscillatory channel flow . here , the strain is largest near the walls and negligible at the center , so some regions may locally exceed the critical strain amplitude , while others do not .",
    "we find that the transition to irreversibility is markedly different compared to the couette flow case studied previously .",
    "self - organization and shear - induced migration contribute to a delayed , simultaneous onset of critical behavior across the channel .",
    "however , non - local particle activity generated in high strain regions near the channel walls prevents the system from becoming reversible even where the strain is negligible , i.e. at the channel centerline .",
    "in contrast to the couette flow case , the fluctuation relaxation time does not diverge at the transition .",
    "these experiments provide important guidance for modeling and suggest additional experimental investigations .",

    "two regimes of migration are observed in oscillatory pressure - driven systems @xcite , where large oscillation amplitudes cause migration to the centerline , and small amplitudes produce a slight migration toward the wall . in our study ,",
    "significant migration toward the centerline is observed at large oscillation amplitude , with negligible migration for the smallest strain amplitudes tested [ fig . [ fig:2](b ) ] .",
    "while the bulk effects of these phenomena are well documented , their consequences for particle self - organization and the onset of irreversibility are unknown .",

    "( b ) a subset of the same data shows that the development of irreversibility is simultaneous throughout the channel.,width=8 ]    irreversible behavior does not occur only where the local strain amplitude surpasses a critical value @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "as the wall strain amplitude is increased , regions in the center of the channel ( @xmath19 ) , where the local strain is negligible , show an increase in diffusivity of two orders of magnitude [ fig . [ fig:3](a ) ] .",
    "although the rate of increase is greater near the wall , the local diffusivity shows a nearly exponential increase with the wall strain amplitude including the centerline , where the local strain amplitude is negligible [ fig . [ fig:3](b ) ] .",
    "the transition to irreversibility in uniformly sheared particle suspensions has been shown to exhibit the characteristics of a continuous phase transition .",
    "the characteristic relaxation time @xmath20 for periodically sampled particle fluctuations to reach a steady state was shown to diverge at the onset of irreversibility in the case of uniformly strained suspensions @xcite .",
    "following the analysis of cort _ et al .",
    "_ , the relaxation time is obtained by fitting a time series of the local particle msds consisting of 500 cycles from periodically sampled data to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the initial and steady values of the particle msd , respectively @xcite .",

    "( b ) the local critical strain , @xmath27 , observed at the global onset @xmath28 , as a function of the local concentration , @xmath29 .",
    "the much steeper variation here compared with the uniformly strained case demonstrates that concentration variations alone are insufficient to account for the simultaneous criticality across the channel.,width=8 ]    for small wall strains , particles reorganize quickly within a few cycles ( @xmath30 cycles ) and settle into a reversible steady state .",
    "as the wall strain is increased , @xmath20 increases abruptly across the entire channel at @xmath31 indicating a simultaneous onset of irreversible behavior [ fig . [ fig:4](a ) ] .",
    "thus , the local critical strain is elevated at the wall and depressed near the channel center ( compared to @xmath32 for @xmath2 in uniform shear ) @xcite .",
    "we also note that @xmath20 does not diverge , but rather maintains an elevated value ( @xmath33 cycles ) as @xmath14 increases further .",
    "the transition to irreversibility is sensitive to the particle concentration @xcite , and for the conditions tested here , the volume fraction can vary from 30% at the walls to 50% in the center of the channel as a result of shear - induced migration [ fig . [",
    "fig:2](c ) ] .",
    "the delayed onset of irreversibility can be explained _ partially _ by this effect . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) , we examine the variation in local critical strain amplitude as a function of the local particle concentration ( for the single detected critical wall strain , @xmath34 ) and compare it to the critical strain amplitude for the previously studied couette flow . the much steeper variation here compared with the uniformly strained case shows that concentration variations alone are insufficient to explain the simultaneous criticality across the channel .",
    "an important additional factor is the role of irreversible activity near the walls , which appears to influence the core of the channel some distance away . as evidence for this effect",
    ", we note that coordinated particle motion is observed in the center of the channel once @xmath34 has been exceeded [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) ] ( see also video2 @xcite ) .",
    "other works have drawn attention to the importance of correlated particle motion or `` transient clusters '' to the rheology and flow of suspensions @xcite .",
    "we quantified this collective motion by a displacement correlation function @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the separation between any two particles .",
    "the corresponding correlation length is denoted by @xmath37 ; the largest measurable correlations are limited by the finite system size . below the critical strain ,",
    "particle motion in the periodically sampled data is minimal and spatially uncorrelated across the channel [ fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ( inset ) ] . however , once the critical strain is surpassed , the correlation length increases in the center , but remains small near the walls [ fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ] .",
    "the larger correlation length of the particle motion in the center region implies that these fluctuations originate from irreversible disturbances some distance away rather than from local particle interactions .",
    "( ) and @xmath26 ( ) .,width=8 ]",
    "we have studied the onset of irreversible motion in particle suspensions in an oscillatory channel flow , where the shear strain is non - uniform .",
    "the transition is shown to be quite different from the previously studied couette flow case in that it does not exhibit a divergent relaxation time .",
    "strikingly , the transition is delayed to higher wall strain amplitude , and occurs simultaneously across the channel , even where the local strain is negligible .",
    "we find that self - organization and shear - induced migration alone can not explain the simultaneous onset .",
    "the transition to irreversible dynamics is not governed purely by the local strain , but depends also on disturbances generated some distance away .",
    "this work is an important step in understanding the coupled behavior of irreversible particle motion ( activity ) , local particle concentration , and imposed strain @xcite .",
