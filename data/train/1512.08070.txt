    "2ec_. this follows from the fact that for any instance of _",
    "2ec _ , we can assume , wlog , that the costs are metric and the solutions do not include multi - edges@xcite , in which case we can apply the @xmath11-approximation due to frederickson and jaja@xcite . for _",

    "2ec _ can be formulated as an integer linear program ( ilp ) as follows , i.e.:@xmath15 the linear programming ( lp ) relaxation of _",
    "2ec _ , denoted by @xmath4 , is obtained by relaxing the integer requirement in ( [ ilptwoec ] ) .",
    "we use opt(_2ec _ ) ( resp .",

    "@xmath17 is defined to be the subgraph of @xmath2 obtained by taking all edges @xmath12 for which @xmath18 .",
    "we are interested in the _ integrality gap _",
    "@xmath3 for @xmath4 , which is the worst case ratio between opt(_2ec _ ) and opt(@xmath4 ) , i.e. @xmath19 this gives a measure of the quality of the lower bound provided by @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , a polynomial - time constructive proof of @xmath20 would provide a @xmath21-approximation algorithm for @xmath3 .    even though _",
    "2ec _ has been intensively studied , little is known about @xmath3 , except that @xmath22@xcite in general , and @xmath23 for the unweighted form of the problem in which one is given a graph and all edge costs are 1 ( see@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in@xcite , carr and ravi study @xmath3 , and conjecture that @xmath24 , however no examples are known for which the integrality gap ratio comes close to @xmath25 .",
    "in@xcite , alexander , boyd and elliott - magwood also study @xmath3 and make the following stronger conjecture based on their findings :    @xcite[conjecture ] the integrality gap @xmath3 for @xmath4 is @xmath5 .    to investigate @xmath3 further",
    ", a natural next step is to study @xmath26 for some interesting class of cost functions .",
    "we investigate @xmath3 for the set of cost functions optimized at a particular family of feasible solutions for @xmath4 . a feasible solution @xmath16 for @xmath4",
    "is called a _ half - integer solution _ if @xmath27 for all @xmath28 , and it is called _ degree - tight _ if @xmath29 for all @xmath30 .",
    "finally , a degree - tight half - integer solution is called a _ half - triangle solution _ if the edges in the support graph @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath31 ( called _ half - edges _ ) form disjoint 3-cycles ( called _ half - triangles _ ) joined by paths of edges of value 1 ( called _ _ ) .",
    "the half - triangle solutions are of interest for studies of @xmath3 as there is that @xmath32 is greatest for cost functions optimized at such solutions ( see@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "for example , the largest such ratio known is asymptotically @xmath5@xcite , and comes from the infinite family of _ 2ec _ problems shown in figure [ 65worsecaseexample ] , where the numbers shown are the edge costs , edges @xmath33 not shown have cost equal to the minimum cost @xmath33 path , and the `` gadget '' pattern is repeated @xmath21 times .",
    "this family is optimized for @xmath4 by the half - triangle solution @xmath16 shown in figure [ 65worsecaseexample2 ] .",
    "also , in a computational study which found @xmath3 exactly for all @xmath2 up to @xmath34 and all half - integer solutions up to @xmath35 , @xmath3 was given by a half - triangle solution for all values of @xmath36@xcite .",
    "0.45 @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.45 @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the main result of this paper is to show that conjecture[conjecture ] is true for any cost function optimized at half - triangles solutions .",

    "2ec _ of cost at most @xmath38 , which implies that @xmath39 for any cost function optimized at half - triangle solutions .",

    "a key idea used in our methods is that of convex combination . in the context of this paper , given a graph @xmath42",

    "here @xmath48 is the _ incidence vector _ of subgraph @xmath44 ( i.e. @xmath49 is the number of copies of edge @xmath14 in @xmath44 ) .",
    "our method is essentially an averaging argument , and can be described as follows : let @xmath16 be any feasible solution of @xmath4 , and suppose we can show that @xmath50 is greater than or equal to a convex combination for some value @xmath21 ( in particular @xmath51 ) .",
    "then for any non - negative cost vector @xmath52 we have @xmath53 .",
    "this implies that for at least one of the @xmath44 , @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath52 is optimized at @xmath16 for @xmath4 , we then have @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and thus @xmath57 for @xmath52 .",
    "given a graph @xmath42 , we sometimes use @xmath58 to denote @xmath59 , and @xmath60 to denote @xmath61 . a graph @xmath62",
    "is called _ cubic _ if every vertex of @xmath62 has degree three .",
    "a _ cut _ in @xmath62 is a set of edges whose removal disconnects @xmath62 into two components , sometimes referred to as the _ shores _ of the cut .",
    "we call a cut _ proper _ if both shores have cardinality at least two . given a vector @xmath63 that is a convex combination , the _ occurrence _ of an edge @xmath14 in that convex combination is @xmath64 .",
    "we sometimes refer to the occurrence of a pattern _ a _ of edges in a convex combination , in which case we mean @xmath65 , and we use the notation @xmath66 to denote it .    in this section , we prove our main result which is that @xmath67 can be expressed as a convex combination for any half - triangle solution @xmath16 .",
    "we do this by first considering the cubic graph we get by shrinking all half - triangles to pseudo - vertices and replacing all 1-paths by singles edges . we obtain a convex combination result for this cubic graph , then show how we can use this result and certain patterns for the half - triangle edges to obtain the result that @xmath67 is a convex combination .",
    "@xmath68 given a cubic 3-edge connected graph @xmath42 , the vector @xmath69 defined by @xmath70 , for all @xmath71 , is a convex combination in which none of the 2-edge connected spanning subgraphs use more than one copy of any edge in @xmath59 .",
    "suppose the contrary , and let @xmath42 be the smallest counter - example for which @xmath72 does not hold .",
    "since @xmath72 can be shown to be true directly for the unique graph @xmath62 with @xmath74 ( see figure [ basecase ] , where bold lines indicate edges in @xmath44 and dotted lines indicate edges omitted ) , we can assume @xmath75 .",
    "for any edge @xmath77 , let the unlabeled adjacent vertices at @xmath78 be @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and the unlabeled adjacent vertices at @xmath81 be @xmath52 and @xmath82 .",
    "since @xmath62 is 3-edge connected , has no proper 3-edge cut and @xmath75 , it follows that @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath52 and @xmath82 are all distinct .",
    "this situation is illustrated on the left of figure[nonontrivial3ec ] , where some incident edges are not shown for vertices @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath52 and @xmath82 .",
    "removing @xmath78 and @xmath81 and their incident edges , and adding edges @xmath83 and @xmath84 yield a new cubic 3-edge connected graph @xmath85 with fewer vertices than @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , @xmath86 holds , so there exists a set of connected spanning subgraphs @xmath44 with multipliers @xmath87 , @xmath88 such that @xmath83 and @xmath84 occur @xmath89 times overall in the convex combination .",
    "there are four patterns possible depending on the absence of @xmath83 and @xmath84 in @xmath44 .",

    "we use two , we use multiplier @xmath96 for each , otherwise we use multiplier @xmath87 . in figure [ patternstomissingedge ] the resulting occurrences of the corresponding patterns in @xmath62 are indicated .",
    "moreover , using ( [ lambdasequiv ] ) we have the occurrence of edges @xmath97 and @xmath98 is @xmath99 , the occurrence of @xmath100 and @xmath101 is @xmath102 , and the occurrence of edge @xmath33 is @xmath103 , and all the other edges occur @xmath89 of the time ( illustrated on the right of figure [ patternstomissingedge ] ) . for simplicity , we will always work with exact fractions : should the occurrence of @xmath33 be less than @xmath104 of the time , we will add it back to arbitrary subgraphs so that it appears exactly @xmath104 overall .      applying the same technique for all edges",
    "@xmath71 taken as edge @xmath33 means that we have @xmath105 convex combinations , which we will refer to as @xmath106 for each @xmath12 .",
    "note that for any edge @xmath107 , @xmath108 occurs @xmath104 in @xmath109 , @xmath108 occurs @xmath110 in @xmath106 for each of the four edges @xmath14 adjacent to @xmath108 , and @xmath108 occurs @xmath89 in the rest of the convex combinations @xmath106 .",
    "we now take a convex combination of the @xmath111 convex combinations @xmath106 , @xmath12 , by multiplying every multiplier @xmath87 used in these convex combinations by @xmath112 . summing the occurrence of every edge in this new convex combination",
    "gives @xmath113therefore , we have a convex combination for @xmath114 for @xmath62 and @xmath72 holds true , contradiction .",
    "notice that the ends of the three edges must be distinct since @xmath62 is 3-edge connected . in this case",
    "we contract each shore of the cut to a single vertex , to obtain graphs @xmath115 with pseudo - vertex @xmath116 and @xmath117 with pseudo - vertex @xmath118 ( as shown in figure[3ecsplitting ] ) . both @xmath119 and @xmath120",
    "are smaller than @xmath62 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , so @xmath123 and @xmath124 hold .",
    "moreover the patterns formed by the occurrence of the edges incident to @xmath116 and @xmath118 are unique and identical in the subgraphs in the corresponding convex combinations .",
    "for instance , exactly @xmath125 of the time , one of the incident edges will not be in the subgraph , on both sides of the cut , and this is true for each of the three incident edges .",
    "the remaining subgraphs contain all three incident edges .",
    "these constant patterns allow us to `` glue '' ( reconnect the edges as there were before the inductive step ) the subgraphs for @xmath119 and @xmath120 together , in such a way that identical patterns at @xmath116 and @xmath118 are matched .",
    "this results in a convex combination for @xmath114 that shows @xmath72 holds , which gives a contradiction .",
    "we now use lemma [ thmthreeseventh ] to obtain our main result below .",
    "we call a graph a _ half - triangle graph _ if @xmath62 is the support graph of a half - triangle solution @xmath16 .",
    "if all 1-paths in @xmath62 consist of a single edge , we call @xmath62 _ simple_.    [ defthm ] @xmath126 given a simple half - triangle graph @xmath42 and a specified 1-edge @xmath127 , the vector @xmath128 defined by @xmath129is a convex combination in which none of the 2-edge connected spanning multi - subgraphs use more than one copy of a half - edge or the edge @xmath130 , and all of them use either one or two copies of a 1-edge .",
    "if @xmath62 has only two half - triangles , then @xmath131 can be shown directly , using the @xmath44 and @xmath87 shown in figure [ specialcase ] , where edges represented by dotted lines are omitted , and @xmath132 and @xmath133 contain a multi - edge .",
    "otherwise , let be the graph obtained from @xmath62 by shrinking each half - triangle to a pseudo - vertex .",
    "graph @xmath95 is cubic and 3-edge connected and has @xmath134 , therefore by lemma [ thmthreeseventh ] , @xmath86 holds , and yields a convex combination for @xmath95 with an edge occurrence of @xmath89 for all edges .",
    "let the subgraphs in this convex combination be @xmath135 with multipliers @xmath136 .    for each subgraph @xmath137 in the convex combination for @xmath95 , the half - triangles ( previously contracted to pseudo - vertices )",
    "will now be expanded to conclude the proof .",
    "we will add 1-edges and half - edges to each expanded @xmath137 in such a way that we create a convex combination for the original half - triangle graph @xmath62 that gives the required occurrence for each edge for the theorem . to accomplish this , for each triangle @xmath138 in each subgraph , we will add half - edges in patterns , where each pattern is used a fraction of the time ( either @xmath139 , or @xmath140 ) . to facilitate this",
    ", we simply assume that we start with a new convex combination of @xmath95 which contains six copies of each subgraph @xmath137 , where each copy has a coefficient of @xmath141 .",
    "now consider any triangle @xmath138 in @xmath62 and let its incident edges be @xmath142 , @xmath63 and @xmath143 . in the convex combination created for @xmath95 , we have all three of these edges , or just two of these edges occur in each subgraph @xmath137 .",
    "let @xmath144 note that @xmath145 , and each of the 1-edges @xmath142 , @xmath63 and @xmath143 occur @xmath89 of the time , thus each is missing exactly @xmath125 of the time .",
    "thus @xmath146",
    "first we consider any expanded triangle @xmath138 which is not incident with edge @xmath130 . for each subgraph @xmath137",

    "note that using each pattern one third of the time can be accomplished by using the patterns of figure[expandingpseudoverticesnoedgemissing ] for @xmath138 for two of the six copies of each @xmath137 where @xmath142 , @xmath63 and @xmath143 occur .",
    "then for each subgraph @xmath137 in which @xmath143 is omitted and @xmath142 and @xmath63 occur , we consider both triangle @xmath138 and the other triangle @xmath149 incident with @xmath143 . in this case",
    "we include the edges in @xmath138 incident with @xmath143 @xmath150 of the time , and the other edge in @xmath138 @xmath150 of the time , and do the opposite in triangle @xmath149 . in all cases",
    "we also include two copies of edge @xmath143 .",
    "the patterns are illustrated in figure[expandingpseudoverticesoneedgemissing ] and result in an occurrence of @xmath150 for each edge in @xmath138 .",
    "note that using each pattern half of the time can be accomplished by using each of the two patterns shown in figure[expandingpseudoverticesoneedgemissing ] for @xmath138 ( and @xmath149 ) in three of the six copies of each @xmath137 in which @xmath143 is omitted .",
    "we do the same for the cases where @xmath142 or @xmath63 are omitted in @xmath137 .",
    "the total occurrence of each half - edge in @xmath138 is @xmath151 which by ( [ newlambdas ] ) is @xmath152 .",
    "we can arbitrarily add back half - edges in the convex combinations to obtain an occurrence of exactly @xmath153 for these edges ( for a complete illustration of the operations and the pattern occurrences , see figure[expandingpseudovertices ] ) .",
    "note that each 1-edge which is not @xmath130 is now doubled whenever it was previously omitted , and thus occurs @xmath5 of the time .",
    "also note that all patterns used in the expansion of the half - triangles ensure that the new multi - subgraphs created from the subgraphs @xmath137 for @xmath95 are also 2-edge connected and spanning in @xmath62 , as required .",
    "next we consider any expanded triangle @xmath138 which is incident with edge @xmath130 , and wlog let @xmath154 .",
    "for each subgraph @xmath44 in which all three edges @xmath142 , @xmath63 and @xmath130 occur , we include two of the three edges in @xmath138 @xmath155 of the time , using the two patterns illustrated in figure[expandingpseudoverticespnotmissing ] ( so we use each pattern in three of the six copies of @xmath137 ) .",
    "then for each subgraph @xmath137 in which @xmath130 is omitted and @xmath142 and @xmath63 occur we include the two edges of @xmath138 incident with @xmath130 in any of these operations .",
    "recall this occurs @xmath156 of the time , by ( [ newlambdas ] ) .",
    "note that we do not double edge @xmath130 .",
    "the total occurrence of each edge of @xmath138 is exactly @xmath153 , and @xmath130 occurs exactly @xmath89 of the time ( see figure [ expandingpseudovertices ] for a complete illustration of these operations and the pattern occurrences ) .",
    "we now have , over all cases , the half - edge occurrence is @xmath153 , @xmath130 occurs @xmath89 of the time , and the occurrence of the other 1-edges is @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , none of the 2-edge connected spanning multi - subgraphs use more than one copy of a half - edge or the edge @xmath130 , and all of them use either one or two copies of a 1-edge . thus @xmath131 holds .",
    "suppose the contrary , and let @xmath62 be the smallest counter - example for which @xmath131 does not hold .",
    "let @xmath119 , @xmath120 be the two sides of the cut @xmath158 in @xmath62 , with @xmath159 and @xmath160 in @xmath119 and @xmath161 and @xmath21 in @xmath120 , and wlog choose @xmath158 such that @xmath162 is 3-edge connected and does not contain @xmath130 .",
