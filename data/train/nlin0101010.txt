    "the transition to turbulence in spatially extended systems does not necessarily take place in all points simultaneously but can be preceeded by the formation of localized structures that grow to eventually fill space .",

    "can be confined to propagating spirals @xcite .",
    "localized turbulence has also been observed in plane couette flow @xcite where the fraction of space filled with turbulent flow has been used as a measure to define the transition to turbulence @xcite . besides these transitional phenomena localized turbulent spots can also be observed in high reynolds number boundary layers @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to connect both the localization of the spots , i.e. the coexistence of a laminar and turbulent phase of the shear flow , and the propagation of the sharp boundaries , i.e. a front - like structure , to phenomena studied in considerable detail within amplitude models @xcite .",
    "indeed , some models show qualitatively similar behavior .",
    "there are , however , several problems that raise questions about the applicability of such models .",
    "for instance , they are not derived from the navier - stokes equation and the extend to which they reflect the hydrodynamical processes and interactions remains open .",
    "furthermore , amplitude equations work best if they can be applied in a situation of linear instability and small amplitudes @xcite , such as the onset of rayleigh - bnard convection near the critical point @xcite .",
    "but many of the turbulent spots arise in shear flows that are linearly stable , at least in the reynolds number region of interest here .",
    "such behavior can be captured in higher - order ginzburg - landau models @xcite , but the required large amplitudes complicate a quantitative comparison .",
    "moreover , investigations of plane couette flow show that the turbulent state is not stable but can decay spontaneously for lower reynolds number values @xcite .",
    "it is our aim here to analyze the evolution of turbulent spots in parallel shear flows , in particular their spanwise spreading .",
    "our flow has free - slip boundary conditions and is driven by a volume force . despite the change in boundary conditions we observe features similar to those in experiments on plane couette flow with rigid boundary conditions and a linear shear profile : this supports the expectation that there are perhaps universal aspects .",
    "the model is moreover well suited for high resolution direct numerical simulations with a fourier - pseudospectral method and allows for a detailed investigation of the dynamics in the transitional region . in particular , we focus on the characterization of the front which separates the laminar and the turbulent region , on the mechanism by which it propagates , on the reynolds number dependence of the front speed and on the large scale flow in the laminar surrounding of the spot .",

    "@xmath35 the local growth rate becomes positive , indicating a linear instability .",
    "investigations of other front - propagation problems , usually within a ginzburg - landau model , show that it is not only the local instability that determines the front speed but that the local curvature in wave number space has to be included as well . in the absence of a derivation of an amplitude equation in a turbulent medium",
    "we phenomenologically take the amplitude in the ginzburg - landau equation to model the envelope of the turbulent intensity @xmath103 , calculated in the middle of the cell at @xmath44 and @xmath11 .",

    "this analysis of the front propagation mechanism , with a local approximation , only cubic terms in the amplitude model and without a discussion of slow transients @xcite that could arise in such models , is rather simplified and can only give an indication of the expected front velocity .",
    "nevertheless , it seems to us that even when these improvements are included the model can not account for the observed spot spreading rates : first of all , it can not say anything about the dynamics below a reynolds number of about 200 , where the spot spreads but where there is no instability . and",
    "secondly , even above this reynolds number , where there is a linear instability , the calculated front speed differs significantly from the observed one .    besides the linear instability mode for spot growth",
    "there is another possibilty , based on the non - normal amplification of perturbations near the spot interface .",
    "because of the action of the perturbation on the basic profile , streamwise vortices need not decay monotonically but can first grow on a time scale of order @xmath27 to an amplitude about a factor @xmath27 larger than the initial amplitude .",
    "this so - called lift - up effect @xcite is most likely responsible for the occurence of streamwise streaks in turbulent shear flows where longitudinal modulations can give rise to secondary instabilities and a perpetual non - periodic time evolution @xcite .",
    "indeed we do observe this cyclic reproduction of the coherent structures in the interface region of the spot as demonstrated in the sequence of fig .",
    "the model then is that the turbulent interior of the spot induces a small perturbation near the interface which will then be amplified and grow turbulent .",
    "the statistical analysis of section  [ sec_basic ] shows that not all perturbations grow turbulent .",
    "thus , if most of the perturbations grow turbulent , the spot will spread , but if most of the perturbations decay , it will shrink . the observed coincidence between the critical reynolds number for transition and the one for spot growth can naturally be explained in this picture .",
    "however , we do not see how to derive other quantitative conclusions from this model .",
    "in particular , the front speed would be given as the quotient of the width of the rolls generated ( this can be read off rather accurately from the frames ) and the time a perturbation needs to grow turbulent .",
    "the latter depends on the amplitude of the initial seed , the threshold for the transition to turbulence and the amplification rate , neither of which seems accessible to independent determination .",
    "our analysis of a shear flow with free slip boundary conditions on two parallel surfaces has revealed many similarities to plane couette flow between rigid walls . as in that case",
    "three velocities connected with the spot can be identified , the velocities of the advancing front , of the outward flow component and of the phase speed of ( oblique ) waves .",
    "they differ in value and in @xmath27-dependence , and relations between them are unknown .",
    "the dependence of the front velocity with respect to reynolds number is consistent with experimental findings @xcite .",
    "many of the results reported here parallel the ones for plane poiseuille flow .",
    "we also find waves and instabilities in the neighborhood of the spot , but they do not lead to quantitative predictions for the front velocity .",
    "the conclusions we draw from this investigation highlight a dilemma : on the one hand side the large scale flow outside the spot does not seem to be important : the spot grows independent of whether there is a linear instability of basic flow plus large scale exterior flow or not , and if there is a linear instability the derived front speed is slower than the observed one .",
    "moreover , the behavior expected from the non - normal amplification mechanism can explain some aspects of the dynamics , especially for lower reynolds numbers .",
    "on the other hand , if the outflow is suppressed , as in the case of a turbulent ribbon that spans the cell in streamwise direction , no growth is observed despite the random initialization of seeds near the spot interface .",
    "perhaps this can explain the observed stop of growth in some experiments @xcite .",
    "so it seems that spot growth is a subtle interplay between local features ( e.g. non - normal amplification ) and global features ( such as the external flow ) .",
    "the connection between both and a quantitative estimate of the growth velocity remain a major puzzle in the dynamics of turbulent spots in parallel shear flows ."

    "<S> three regions in the spanwise spot cross - section can be identified : a turbulent interior , an interface layer with prominent streamwise streaks and vortices and a laminar exterior region with a large scale flow induced by the presence of the spot . </S>",
    "<S> the lift - up of streamwise streaks which is caused by non - normal amplification is clearly detected in the region adjacent to the spot interface . </S>",
    "<S> the spot can be characterized by an exponentially decaying front that moves with a speed different from that of the cross - stream outflow or the spanwise phase velocity of the streamwise roll pattern . </S>",
    "<S> growth of the spots seems to be intimately connected to the large scale outside flow , for a turbulent ribbon extending across the box in downstream direction does not show the large scale flow and does not grow . </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , the large scale flow induces a linear instability in the neighborhood of the spot , but the associated front velocity is too small to explain the spot spreading .    2 </S>"
