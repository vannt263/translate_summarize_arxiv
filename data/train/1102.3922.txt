    "for the last fifteen years , the evolutionary , spectral , and atmospheric theory of brown dwarfs has evolved in tandem with the explosive growth in the number of known examples .",
    "that number now stands near 1000 .",
    "this maturing theory has been used to interpret spectroscopic and photometric observations of such substellar - mass objects ( smos ) and , thereby , to derive effective temperatures ( ) , gravities ( @xmath5 ) , bolometric luminosities , compositions , masses ( @xmath6 ) , and ages ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the focus of study has been the new spectroscopic types , l and t , that have emerged to accomodate objects with from @xmath0500 k to @xmath02200 k. both chemical equilibrium and non - equilibrium models have found roles and gradual improvements in molecular opacity and thermochemical databases suggest that objects with molecular atmospheres may someday be studied with the same precision as are stars with simpler atomic atmospheres , the latter albeit after almost a century of development .    however , most brown dwarfs are found as singletons , and those in binaries have only rarely been used to derive dynamical masses with which to provide independent checks on spectroscopically - derived masses ( konopacky et al .",
    "2010 ; liu , dupuy , & leggett 2010 ) . too often , however , such comparisons are cast as fundamental tests of core assumptions in the models .",
    "little mention is made of the equal importance of atmospheric opacities , metallicities , cloud models , and ages in determining whether theory fits data .",
    "in fact , these last - mentioned quantities are crucial in determining the physical properites of a given brown dwarf .",
    "in addition to obtaining independent masses , measuring the radii of brown dwarfs can be an equally powerful means of testing the associated physical theory ( burgasser , burrows , & kirkpatrick 2006 ) .",
    "however , here too one is testing a multi - parameter theory , and not a universal radius ( @xmath8)@xmath4mass relation .",
    "the latter exists only for cold , very old , objects of a given elemental composition .",
    "hot , evolving brown dwarfs with a priori unknown atmospheric and interior compositions ( and opacities ) can span a ( wide ) range ( perhaps 25% ) of radii for a given mass and age .",
    "the brown dwarf s atmospheric opacities determine the rate with which heat escapes the convective core , and at which the core entropy evolves , and it is the core entropy which sets the radius , for a given mass and internal composition .",
    "gas - phase atmospheric opacities can be augmented by silicate and iron cloud opacities .",
    "the presence of clouds , for which there is as yet no rigorous or credible model , complicates the theory and interpretation of the measured physical properties of brown dwarfs .",
    "the thicker the atmosphere , the slower the radius shrinks and the larger is the radius at a given mass and age .",
    "since the gas - phase opacities depend upon composition ( atmospheric metallicity ) and extant cloud models are still crude , without additional constraints on these factors there is an inherent ambiguity in the comparison between measured and theoretical radii that should temper any conclusions drawn .",
    "what is more , rapid rotation and ( perhaps ) magnetic activity ( chabrier , gallardo , & baraffe 2007 ; morales et al .",
    "2009 ) can further complicate the interpretation of an observed radius and what one can deduce from differences between measured and model radii .    for a given mass and age",
    "there is a physical , realistic _",
    "range _ of possible radii that varies with atmospheric metallicity and cloud optical depth , both of which would need to be measured to properly falsify theoretical models . for simplicity , evolutionary models",
    "have frequently been provided by theorists for only a restricted set of parameters ( e.g. , at solar metallicity ) and for a single ad hoc prescription for clouds ( or with no clouds ) ( burrows et al . 1993,1997,2001,2006 ; chabrier & baraffe 1997 ; baraffe et al . 1998,2003 ; saumon & marley 2008 ) .",
    "however , these models have been applied quite generally , with an assumption of universality that is not warranted . as a consequence , any deviation between these theoretical models and physical measurements ,",
    "be they of radius or mass , must first account for the effects of different atmospheres before declaring anything about , for example , the underlying equation of state or fundamental assumptions of the modeling exercise .",
    "moreover , without a good constraint on the age of the brown dwarf ( perhaps from a good estimate of the primary s age and the assumption of coevality ) , any radius measurement is of correspondingly limited utility if the goal is to test structural theory beyond its  zeroth - order \" aspects .",
    "recently , numerous exoplanet transit surveys have collectively discovered and characterized more than one hundred transiting companions to nearby stars .",
    "these surveys include _ kepler _ ( koch et al .",
    "2010 ; borucki et al .",
    "2010 ) , _ corot _ ( baglin et al .",
    "2006 ) , wasp ( pollacco et al . 2004 ) , ogle ( udalski et al . 2002 ; konacki et al . 2003 ) , and hat ( bakos et al . 2002 ) .",
    "importantly , byproducts of such surveys , and their radial - velocity follow - up , are radii and masses for almost all of them , enabling the type of structural study to which we alluded above .",
    "most of the transiting companions have masses near or below that of jupiter and most of them are very close to their primaries .",
    "such proximity introduces the need to incorporate the effects of irradiation ( and perhaps tidal heating ) in any interpretative study of the radius@xmath4mass relation of objects in this mass range .",
    "however , a small subset of the transiting companions found are quite massive ( above @xmath015 ) and the radii of such smos should not be affected by stellar irradiation ( burrows et al . 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , data for these more massive objects can be used to constrain brown dwarf theory .",
    "of most interest for such a study are _",
    "kepler s _ lhs 6343 ( johnson et al . 2010 ) , corot-15b ( bouchy et al . 2011 ) , corot-3b ( deleuil et al . 2008 ) , and wasp-30b ( anderson et al . 2011 ) .",
    "since they reside in a physical region that is seamlessly connected to that of brown dwarfs , the very - low - mass stars ( vlms ) ogle - tr-122b ( pont et al .",
    "2005 ) and ogle - tr-123b ( pont et al .",
    "2006 ) , though of stellar mass , test the same basic theories .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate a new suite of evolutionary models with new sets of atmospheric boundary conditions for various atmospheric metallicities , with and without clouds ( i.e. , clear ) . with these models , we are able to demonstrate and quantify the dependence of the radius of a brown dwarf of a given mass and age on the variety of different atmospheric characteristics expected .",
    "brown dwarfs should vary in metallicity and cloud cover .",
    "higher - metallicity atmospheres cool more slowly and , therefore , result in larger brown dwarf radii , all else being equal .",
    "cloudy atmospheres similarly retard radius shrinkage and lead to larger radii at a given mass and age .",
    "though we do not yet know how to incorporate this possibility , higher - metallicity atmospheres may also have thicker cloud decks , amplifying the effect of increasing metallicity .",
    "be that as it may , one should expect a range of realistic brown dwarf radii at a given mass and age .",
    "our paper quantifies this range to highlight this important fact , while also exploring the dependence on the helium mass fraction ( @xmath1 ) .    with the models we generate , we fit various of the recently measured transiting brown dwarf radii .",
    "we have chosen for this study the brown dwarfs lhs 6343c ( johnson et al .",
    "2010 ) , corot-15b ( bouchy et al . 2011 ) , corot-3b ( deleuil et al.2008 ) , and wasp-30b ( anderson et al . 2011 ) , and the vlms ogle - tr-122b ( pont et al . 2005 ) and ogle - tr-123b ( pont et al .",
    "2006 ) , but the generic nature of the expected spread in radius at a given mass and age is the true focus of this investigation .",
    "while documenting representative theoretical differences in radius evolutions for different metallicities and helium fractions ( with and without clouds ) , we at the same time demonstrate that radius@xmath4mass measurements do not constrain solely the equation of state .",
    "the atmospheric opacities ( and , less so , the helium fraction and overall internal compositions ) are important factors in the interpretation of any radius measurement .",
    "moreover , the significant remaining uncertainties in the ages of all these systems , and the difficulties and potential systematic inaccuracies in the measurements themselves , partially undermine any attempt to arrive at definitive conclusions concerning the accuracy or usefulness of any theoretical evolutionary model .",
    "nevertheless , the magnitude of the expected theoretical spread in radii for brown dwarfs at a given mass and age should be more robust , and , as we demonstrate , is certainly not trivial .    in section [ data ]",
    ", we summarize the data for the transiting objects upon which we focus in this paper .",
    "then , in section [ method ] we review the techniques we have employed to calculate the evolutionary models , using an atmosphere / spectral code to obtain the boundary conditions for our henyey evolutionary code . in section [ general ] , we discuss the general trends and behaviors of the full model suite , after which in section [ individual ] we determine individual object characteristics from comparisons with the collection of new models .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] , we review the overarching conclusions concerning the radius@xmath4mass relation that have emerged from this study .",

    "2001,2004 ) .    therefore , to incorporate clouds into the spectral and atmosphere models , we introduce a flexible parametrization that allows us to vary cloud opacities and effects . for this study",

    "we chose @xmath02300 k as our cloud base since it is where the most refractory species ( calcium - aluminum silicates ) condense .",
    "we chose the forsterite condensation line to cap this region because forsterite has one of the lowest condensation temperatures ( for a given pressure ) .",
    "hence , the physical region where refractory clouds reside is more extensive than where forsterite alone would reside . to attempt a multi - species meteorological model , incorporating the optical properties of all the expected refractories and the role of convection in grain growth , and to pretend to model the various particle sizes and shapes and the interaction between the various grain species ( mantling , collisions , etc . ) , would introduce extra complexity wholely out of proportion with the sparse dataset available for these very - remotely - sensed objects .",
    "note that if only forsterite clouds obtained , the  clausius - clapeyron \" condensation line would be the natural cloud base ( and not the @xmath02300 k line ) , but that convection and turbulence would still likely extend the cloud upward to lower pressures .",

    "this is the motivation for introducing the parameter @xmath50 , thereby capturing this physical extension above the forsterite condensation line .    for the cloud models in this study , we set @xmath54 and @xmath55 and use a modal particle size @xmath56 @xmath57 m ( sudarksy et al . 2000 ) , where the size distribution is given by : @xmath58}\\ , .\\ ] ] we use mie scattering theory with a table of complex indices of refraction as a function of wavelength to calculate the absorption and scattering opacities for the grains in the clouds . in summary , with this general cloud model we place clouds where they may be likely to reside , over the collective condensation region , and then vary the modal particle size of forsterite grains to create a model set with a wide range of possible cloud optical thicknesses .    to mimic the transformation of a young , cloudy object evolving into an old , cloud - free object , and the l - to - t transition , we linearly combine cloudy ( @xmath59 ) and cloudfree ( @xmath60 ) spectra using the phenomenological prescription : @xmath61 thus",

    "although our approach is intrinsically different from @xmath69 parametrization of saumon & marley ( 2008 ) , the resulting cloud structures and temperature profiles are similar across the l - to - t transition .",
    "an evolutionary henyey code is used to establish the mapping between @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( mass - age ) pairs . with the equation of state ( eos ) for hydrogen / helium mixtures of ( saumon , chabrier , & van horn 1995 ) and specified values of the deuterium and helium fractions ,",
    "the code solves the equations of stellar structure .",
    "we emphasize that the hydrogen / helium eos of saumon , chabrier , & van horn ( 1995 ) employs the volume addition law for such mixtures and does not have a rigorous means to incorporate heavy elements in a consistent fashion .",
    "hence , though the core and atmosphere will certainly have the same [ fe / h ] , we do not include heavies in our eos .",
    "currently , there does not exist a reliable eos for more complicated mixtures .",
    "if the matter were an ideal gas , then one could easily incorporate any range of elemental abundance mixtures by calculating the appropriate mean molecular weight .",
    "however , the material in smos experiences significant coulomb interaction effects .",
    "indeed , at the high densities and low entropies encountered in their cores , the coulomb effects are important . at higher densities ,",
    "degeneracy effects predominate , and the eos , depending as it does on the electron fraction per baryon , again simplifies . however , with brown dwarfs we are often in the intermediate regime where coulomb and degeneracy effects compete , an awkward regime to treat well . at times",
    ", theorists have employed altered helium fractions to treat heavies , boosting @xmath1 by an  appropriate \" amount and then using the h / he eos with the enhanced @xmath1 ( spiegel , burrows , & milsom 2011 ; guillot et al .",

    ", a measurement of a brown dwarf radius may be less useful than some might expect for testing the hydrogen / helium equation of state .",

    "this slightly counterintuitive result at larger masses is due to the enhanced core hydrogen burning rate for the larger @xmath1 , despite the slightly smaller hydrogen fraction . in hydrostatic equilibrium ,",
    "the fact that at higher mean molecular weight the adiabat is higher results in a higher core temperature for an isentropic core . hence , larger @xmath1 ( which translates into a higher mean molecular weight ) results in higher central temperatures , which generate higher thermonuclear powers .",

    "the condition for the latter is that the core thermonuclear power equal the atmospheric luminosity @xmath4 the first mass for which this condition is satisfied defines the main sequence edge .",
    "however , even for lower masses , thermonuclear power can retard the decay of the core entropy , which for a given mass determines the outer radius . that the specific heat decreases with increasing @xmath1 is a slightly mitigating effect , but this is trumped by the enhancement in nuclear burning rate . the same phemonenon was identified in spiegel , burrows , & milsom ( 2011 ) in the context of deuterium burning .",

    "in this paper , we have generated a collection of evolutionary models for brown dwarfs and very - low - mass stars for different atmospheric metallicities , with and without clouds .",
    "these models employ realistic atmosphere boundary conditions that allow us to consistently predict , given a detailed opacity model , the evolution of the object s radius .",

    "the spread in radius at a given mass can be as large as @xmath00.1  to @xmath00.25 ( or @xmath010% to @xmath025% ) , with higher - metallicity , higher - cloud - thickness atmospheres resulting quite naturally in larger radii , all else being equal .",
    "for each 0.1 dex increase in atmospheric [ fe / h ] , the radius is expected to increase by @xmath01% to @xmath02.5% , depending upon age and mass .",

    "conversely , one should expect a range of radii for the natural range of metallicities and possible cloud properties expected for substellar objects and vlm stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "in addition , we have calculated the effect of helium fraction on brown dwarf and vlm radii and find that , while for smaller masses and older ages radius decreases with increasing helium fraction ( as expected ) , for more massive brown dwarfs and a wide range of ages it increases with helium fraction .",
    "this runs counter to common lore , which expects that higher mean molecular weights universally result in smaller radii .",
    "we find that the increase in radius in going from @xmath2 to @xmath3 can be as large as @xmath00.025 ( @xmath02.5% ) .",

    "we do not suggest that the cloud model we constructed for this investigation is definitive , nor uniquely applicable .",
    "rather , we engineered a cloud model , and its corresponding opacities and optical depths , to be representative of the generic effect of the clouds we know reside in brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "we have sought merely to demonstrate that the presence or absence of clouds has an important effect on the radius of a brown dwarf .",
    "we note that many other cloud models can be constructed which may prove in the long run to be more viable .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative effect of clouds that we have highlighted is robust .",
    "similarly , and more straightforwardly , atmospheric metallicity has a direct and clear effect on brown dwarf radii that needs to be accounted for in any interpretation of radius measurements .",
    "ten to twenty - five percent variations in radius exceed any reasonable error stemming from uncertainities in the equation of state alone and serve to emphasize that measurements of brown dwarf radii constrain a collection of effects , importantly including the atmosphere and condensate cloud models . without an independent measure of the atmospheric metallicity , constraints on the surface clouds , and a good age estimate , a measurement of a brown dwarf radius may be more difficult to interpret than previously thought .    increasing the atmospheric metallicity of the vlm stars we studied in this paper from 0.0 to 0.5 increases their radii by @xmath04% .",
    "if we increase their atmospheric metallicitiy from -0.5 to 0.5 , their radii increase by @xmath010% .",
