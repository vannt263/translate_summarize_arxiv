    "these are the generalization to a non - zero @xmath5 of the polarizabilities introduced in real compton scattering ( rcs ) .",
    "let us recall that polarizabilities measure how much the internal structure of a composite particle is deformed when an external em field is applied .",
    "the description of the rcs process at low energy involves six polarizabilities ( @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ) which parametrize the unknown part of nucleon structure , due to its internal em deformation ( see ref.3 and references therein ) .",
    "performed since the sixties , rcs experiments have measured the proton electric and magnetic polarizabilities @xmath8 and @xmath9  @xcite , the results of which can be summarized as : i ) the proton is a rather rigid object ( polarizabilities are small ) , ii ) @xmath9 is smaller than @xmath8 , due to a cancellation between its paramagnetic and diamagnetic contributions .",
    "these observables can be generalized to any @xmath5 , such that in vcs at low energy one probes the nucleon polarizability locally inside the particle , with a distance scale given by @xmath5 .",
    "equivalently , vcs can be seen as elastic scattering on a nucleon placed in an applied em field , and hence the gps can be seen as a measurement of `` distorted '' form factors . in all cases",
    "these observables are intrinsic characteristics of the particle , and provide a valuable and original test of models describing nucleon structure .",
    "vcs is accessed by photon electroproduction  @xmath10 , which is the coherent sum of the compton process and the bethe - heitler ( bh ) process , or electron bremsstrahlung ; see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "the main kinematic variables are defined in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] : the initial and final photon three - momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the final photon angles @xmath13 and @xmath14 , in the @xmath15 center of mass .",
    "the  @xmath16  kinematics is fully defined by these four variables plus the virtual photon polarisation @xmath17 .",
    "= 11.7 cm = 3.cm    = 11.cm = 2.5 cm    the low - energy behavior of the amplitude @xmath18 has first been worked out by p. guichon _",
    "only a brief summary is given here , and more details can be found in ref.5 .",
    "the compton amplitude decomposes into a born term , characterized by a proton in the intermediate state , and a non - born term containing all other intermediate states .",
    "the bh and born amplitudes are entirely calculable , with proton em form factors as inputs . the non - born amplitude @xmath19 contains the unknown part of the nucleon structure . below pion threshold",
    "a low energy theorem ( let ) allows to expand @xmath19 in powers of @xmath12 ; the first term of the expansion is a known analytical function of six independent gps , which are the goal of the measurements .",
    "these gps are derived from a multipole expansion of @xmath19 .",
    "one defines mutipole amplitudes  @xmath20   according to the two involved em transitions : @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) stands for initial ( final ) photon polarization states ( @xmath23 longitudinal , magnetic , electric ) , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the total angular momentum of the initial ( final ) transition , and @xmath26 stands for proton ( non)spin - flip .",
    "the @xmath27 multipoles depend on photon momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the gps are defined ( up to dimensional factors ) as the limit of @xmath27 when @xmath28 , i.e. in the limit of a static em field ; they are denoted @xmath29 and depend only on @xmath11 .",
    "table [ tab1 ] summarizes the notations for the two scalar ( @xmath30 ) and the four spin gps ( @xmath31 ) , and also shows their continuity to the real photon point ( @xmath32 ) .",
    ".the six lowest order generalized polarizabilities ( also called dipole gps , due to @xmath33).[tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "polarizabilities and generalized polarizabilities are intrinsic characteristics of composite particles . as such it is interesting to measure them for every hadron , including e.g. the neutron , pion , etc , although this may seem a task for the far future .",
    "undoubtedly , investigations of the vcs process on the proton have been fruitful , and will continue to bring exciting new results in the coming years .",
    "future developments are foreseen in various c.m .",
    "energy domains : @xmath34 at low energy , the mapping of the unpolarized structure functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 versus @xmath5 can be completed , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be disentangled by an @xmath17-separation . by studying   @xmath39 with a polarized beam and recoil proton polarimetry , one can in principle disentangle the six independent gps entering the first order term of the let , giving access to the spin gps .",
    "such experiments are planned at mainz and bates .",
    "@xmath34 in the resonance region , the vcs process was investigated for the first time by the jlab e93 - 050 experiment .",
    "it demonstrated the feasibility of gp extraction above pion threshold , owing to an enhanced sensitivity of the vcs cross section to gps in the delta resonance region .",
    "future experiments along these lines at high @xmath5 are foreseeable , either with or without polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "@xmath34 vcs at higher energies is certainly a very active field , with growing interest in deep vcs and the gpds . using a longitudinally polarized electron beam ,",
    "the hermes and jlab - clas collaborations have determined a single spin asymmetry in  @xmath40  @xcite , giving the first input to gpd models , and more such experiments are planned at jlab , hermes and compass in the near future .",
    "as energies increase , experimental resolution limitations make it more and more difficult to isolate the one - photon electroproduction channel , and all present and future experiments plan to detect all three particles in the final state in order to reach exclusivity .",
