    "a precise extraction of the cabibo - kobayashi - maskawa parameters is predicated on our ability to control the theoretical uncertainties involved in the predictions of heavy hadron decays . as such , it is imperative that we perform our calculations within a systematic expansion .",
    "heavy quark effective theory@xcite leads to one such approximation scheme .",
    "it leads to predictions for the inclusive heavy hadron decay rates and spectra@xcite  as an expansion in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as well as predictions for heavy to heavy exclusive rates at zero recoil .",
    "thus , with our present theoretical methods we are capable of extracting @xmath6 at the level of a few percent .",
    "however , prospects for measuring @xmath3 are much bleaker .",
    "the standard method of extraction based on the lepton endpoint spectrum will likely be plagued by large theoretical uncertainties@xcite , while an extraction from the hadronic spectrum@xcite will suffer from the difficulty of the measurement itself . given that exclusive modes have already been measured",
    ", it would be nice if we could get a handle on the exclusive form factors themselves .",
    "unfortunately , our ability to calculate in qcd is limited to inclusive quantities due to the fact that quark - hadron duality is in itself an inclusive concept .",
    "if we attempt to completely eliminate the excited states from our calculation we begin to probe the dynamics of confinement , of which we are effectively ignorant . however , if we do not eliminate the excited states , but merely note that their contribution is positive definite , then we can derive bounds on the form factors instead of predictions .",
    "this idea was originally formulated by bjorken to derive upper bounds@xcite on form factors as a function of momentum transfer @xmath7 , including a well - known bound on the slope of the isgur - wise function at zero recoil .",
    "in addition , voloshin@xcite was able to find a lower bound at zero recoil .",
    "a few years later , bigi @xcite showed that these bounds can be derived from sum rules similar to those developed for deep inelastic scattering , and are in fact the leading order term in a systematic expansion in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "these sum rules were then used to refine bounds on heavy - to - heavy matrix elements at or near zero recoil@xcite and were applied as well to heavy - to - light form factors far from zero recoil @xcite . in the latter reference , momentum - dependent lower bounds were also developed .",
    "these bounds are useful for several reasons .",
    "they may be used to fine - tune and discriminate among models used extensively for ckm extractions and monte - carlo simulations of backgrounds .",
    "given the measured @xmath7 dependence of a form factor , the upper and lower bounds may be used to extract a value for @xmath3 without relying on models . since model predictions for  and",
    "decay rates vary by more than a factor of four , it is reasonable to ask whether comparing the total rate to the integrated bounds may yield a more accurate extraction of @xmath3 .",
    "we will see that the  sum rule can place a more restrictive lower bound on @xmath3 than can be obtained by the union of models .",
    "an upper bound may be derived as well using recent work@xcite describing the shape of form factors to handle the problematic zero recoil region .    in this letter",
    "we continue the work begun in ref .",
    "@xcite by including the effect of radiative corrections on the form factor bounds .",
    "these effects are of leading order for the lower bounds , and in one case dominate the upper bound . due to the length of the calculations we only present partial results here and leave the more technical aspects for a subsequent , longer publication , where we will present the full one loop radiative corrections to the hadronic tensor @xmath8 defined by t^(vq , q^2 ) & = & d^4 x  e^-i q x b(v)| t ( j^(x ) j^(0 ) ) |b(v ) + & & -g^ t_1 + v^v^ t_2 - i ^",

    ". these corrections are useful in their own right since they can be used to calculate physical rates with arbitrary cuts , via a simple numerical integration .",
    "let us briefly review the derivation of the bounds .",
    "we follow the notation used in @xcite and refer the reader to this reference for details .",
    "the idea is to equate the inclusive rate , which is calculable within perturbative qcd using an operator product expansion , with the sum over exclusive states .",
    "the sum over exclusive states is then truncated , and the equality is changed to an inequality . more explicitly , equating partonic and hadronic sums over intermediate states in eq .",
    "( [ tdef ] ) , we have [ mastersr ] & & | h| aj | b |^2 4 m_b e_h + + & & - _ x ( 2)^3 ^(3)(p_x - q ) | b| aj | x |^2 2 m_b ( + e_h + e_x -2 m_b ) = a^ t^ope _ a^. here @xmath13 is an arbitrary four - vector chosen to pick out the form factor of interest for the @xmath14 transition ( eventually we will take @xmath15 to be a pion or rho ) , @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the first two terms represent the local cut in the complex @xmath19 plane corresponding to the semi - leptonic decay process .",
    "the third term arises from the `` distant cut , '' corresponding to the pair production process .",
    "the sum over states contains the usual phase space integration @xmath20 for each particle , while @xmath21 is shorthand for _ x h ( 2)^3 ^(3 ) ( p_x + q ) . to justify the use of the ope on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ata ] ) , we perform a contour integral over @xmath16 with a weighting function as described in @xcite .",
    "we choose the weighting function @xmath22 to be @xmath23 .",
    "the results depend rather mildly on the precise form of the weight function .",
    "] delta has the effect of cutting off the contribution from excited states , which in turn improves the bound beyond what one would get trivially from insisting that the one exclusive mode be less than the inclusive rate .",
    "however , as discussed above it is not possible to choose @xmath24 to be too small , since as we eliminate the contributions from excited states we become more sensitive to hadronization effects , and errors due to duality violation become important .",
    "thus , we must choose @xmath24 small enough to maximize the utility of our bounds , yet large enough to preserve their validity , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a typical hadronic scale .",
    "furthermore , the ope is an expansion in @xmath27 , so we can expect it to converge only when the hadronic three momentum @xmath28 is sufficiently large , @xmath29 .    by appropriate choice of contour we may eliminate the contribution from the unphysical cut .",
    "the upper bound may then be found by noticing that the excited state contribution is positive definite , leading to d  w _ ( )  a^ t^ope _ a^. a lower bound can found by using the fact that ( e_1 - e_h ) w_(e_x -e_h )   w_(e_x -e_h )  , where @xmath30 is the energy of the first excited state more massive than @xmath15 .",
    "the contribution of multi - particle states with energies less than that of the first excited resonance has been neglected , as they are suppressed by both phase space and large-@xmath31 power counting .",
    "we therefore have both upper and lower bounds , [ bnds ] d  w _ ( )  a^ t^ope _ a^ d  w _",
    "( )  a^ t^ope _ a^ .",
    "since eq .",
    "( [ mastersr ] ) forces @xmath32 , we see that the last term above may be interpreted as the average excitation energy of the higher states contributing to the sum rule , weighted by @xmath33 . as emphasized in @xcite , the excitation energy begins at @xmath34 and receives radiative corrections of order @xmath35 .",
    "since these two quantities are numerically comparable , the lower bounds are not trustworthy without the radiative corrections , which we now include . furthermore , given that our bounds are only valid when @xmath36 , we see that the lower bound will only be useful if  1 .",
    "thus , we see again there is a trade off between the utility and validity of the lower bound , although we are helped in this case by the fact that typical hadronic masses @xmath37 are numerically larger than nonperturbative condensates such as @xmath38 .",
    "the range in @xmath39 for which the lower bounds are both useful and reliable depends on the nonperturbative corrections @xmath40 presented in @xciteand the radiative correction @xmath41 presented here .",
    "we will see that the usefulness of the lower bound depends sensitively on the numerical value of the heavy quark parameter @xmath42 .",

    "the lower bound for data set c is not shown because it is unphysical once perturbative corrections are included ( that is , it becomes negative ) .    to assess the convergence of the perturbative and nonperturbative expansions , we look at the upper and lower bounds at @xmath64 , corresponding to @xmath65 . for data set a with @xmath58 and @xmath66 , the perturbative corrections in eq .",
