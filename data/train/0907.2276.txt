    "the past several years have witnessed tremendous progress in our understanding of the mathematical structure of scattering amplitudes , particularly in maximally supersymmetric theories .",
    "it is easy to argue that the seeds of this progress were sown over two decades ago by the discovery  @xcite of the stunningly simple formula , @xmath5 to denote superspace amplitudes with the overall delta - function of supermomentum conservation suppressed . ]",
    "@xmath6 for the maximally helicity violating ( mhv ) color - ordered subamplitude for @xmath0-gluon scattering .",
    "the importance of this formula goes far beyond simply knowing the answer for a certain scattering amplitude , which one may or may not be particularly interested in . rather , the mere existence of such a simple formula for something which would normally require enormously tedious calculations using traditional feynman diagram techniques suggests firstly that the theory must possess some remarkable and deeply hidden mathematical structure , and secondly that if one actually is interested in knowing the answer for a certain amplitude it behooves one to discover and understand this structure . in other words ,",
    "the formula  ( [ eq : pt ] ) is as important psychologically as it is physically , since it provides strong motivation for digging more deeply into scattering amplitudes .",
    "much of the progress on gluon amplitudes can be easily recycled and applied to graviton amplitudes due ultimately to the klt relations  @xcite which roughly speaking state that `` gravity is yang - mills squared '' .",
    "slightly more precisely , the klt relations express an @xmath0-graviton amplitude as a sum over permutations of the square of the color - ordered @xmath0-gluon subamplitude times some simple extra factors ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "there are several indications that maximal supergravity may be an extraordinarily remarkable theory  @xcite , and possibly even ultraviolet finite  @xcite , but our feeling is that even at tree level we are still far from fully unlocking the structure of graviton amplitudes .    to illustrate this disparity we need look no further than the simplest graviton amplitudes .",
    "the original bgk ( berends , giele and kuijf ) formula for the @xmath0-graviton mhv amplitude  @xcite is now over 20 years old . for later convenience we review here a different form due to mason and skinner  @xcite , who proved the equivalence of the original bgk formula to the expression @xmath7 where the sum indicates a sum over all @xmath8 permutations of the labels @xmath9 and we use the convention @xmath10    the fact that any closed form expression exists at all for this quantity , the calculation of which would otherwise be vastly more complicated even than the corresponding one for @xmath0 gluons , is an amazing achievement .",
    "nevertheless the formula has some features which strongly suggest that it is not the end of the story .",
    "first of all , the formula  ( [ eq : ms ] ) does not manifest the requisite permutation symmetry of an @xmath0-graviton superamplitude .",
    "specifically , any superamplitude @xmath11 must be fully symmetric under all @xmath12 permutations of the labels @xmath13 of the external particles , but only an @xmath14 subgroup of this symmetry is manifest in  ( [ eq : ms ] ) ( several formulas which manifest a slightly larger @xmath1 subgroup are known  @xcite ) .",
    "of course one can check , numerically if necessary , that  ( [ eq : ms ] ) does in fact have this symmetry , but it is far from obvious .",
    "moreover , even the @xmath14 symmetry arises in a somewhat contrived way , via an explicit sum over permutations .",
    "undoubtedly the summand in  ( [ eq : ms ] ) contains redundant information which is washed out by taking the sum .",
    "this situation should be contrasted with that of yang - mills theory , where  ( [ eq : pt ] ) is manifestly invariant under the appropriate dihedral symmetry group ( not the full permutation group , due to the color ordering of gluons ) .",
    "secondly , one slightly disappointing feature of all previously known mhv formulas including  ( [ eq : ms ] ) is the appearance of `` @xmath15 '' , which indicates that a particular cyclic ordering of the particles must be chosen in order to write the formula , even though a graviton amplitude ultimately can not depend on any such ordering since gravitons do not carry any color labels .",
    "this vestigial feature usually traces back to the use of the klt relations to calculate graviton amplitudes by recycling gluon amplitudes .",
    "an important feature of graviton amplitudes is that they fall off like @xmath16 as the supermomenta of any two particles are taking to infinity in a particular complex direction ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for the most complete treatment ) , unlike in yang - mills theory where the falloff is only @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that this exceptionally soft behavior of graviton tree amplitudes is of direct importance for the remarkable ultraviolet cancellations in supergravity loop amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 falloff of  ( [ eq : ms ] ) is manifest for each term separately inside the sum over permutations .",
    "two classes of previously known formulas for the @xmath0-graviton mhv amplitude are : those like  ( [ eq : ms ] ) which manifest the @xmath16 falloff but only @xmath14 symmetry , and others ( see for example  @xcite ) which have a larger @xmath1 symmetry but only manifest falloff like @xmath17 . in the latter class of formulas",
    "the stronger @xmath16 behavior arises from delicate and non - obvious cancellations between various terms in the sum .",
    "this is both a feature and a bug .",
    "it is a feature because it implies the existence of linear identities ( which have been called bonus relations in  @xcite ) between individual terms in the sum which have proven useful , for example , in establishing the equality of various previously known but not obviously equivalent formulas  @xcite .",
    "but it is a bug because it indicates that the @xmath1-invariant formulas contain redundant information distributed amongst the various terms in the sum .",
    "the bonus relations allow one to squeeze this redundant information out of any @xmath1-invariant formula at the cost of reducing the manifest symmetry to @xmath14 .",
    "it is difficult to imagine that it might be possible to improve upon the parke - taylor formula  ( [ eq : pt ] ) for the @xmath0-gluon mhv amplitude .",
    "however , for the reasons just reviewed , we feel that  ( [ eq : ms ] ) can not be the end of the story for gravity .",
    "ideally one would like to have a formula for @xmath0-graviton scattering that ( 1 ) is manifestly @xmath18 symmetric without the need for introducing an explicit sum over permutations to impose the symmetry _",
    "vi et armis _ ; ( 2 ) makes no vestigial reference to any cyclic ordering of the @xmath0 gravitons , and ( 3 ) manifests @xmath16 falloff term by term , making it unsqueezable by the bonus relations .    in this paper",
    "we present and prove the `` tree formula ''  ( [ eq : main ] ) for the mhv scattering amplitude which addresses the second and third points but only manifests @xmath1 symmetry . in section 2",
    "we introduce the tree formula and discuss several special cases as well as the general soft limit .",
    "in section 3 we work out the simple link representation of the amplitude in twistor space , from which new physical space formula follows .",
    "finally the proof is in section 4 .",
    "* note added *    after this paper appeared we learned of an ansatz for the mhv graviton amplitude presented in section 6 of  @xcite which upon inspection is immediately seen to share the nice features of the tree formula .",
    "in fact , although terms in the two formulas are arranged in different ways ( labeled tree diagrams versus young tableaux ) , it is not difficult to check that their content is actually identical .",
    "interestingly the formula of  @xcite was constructed with the help of `` half - soft factors '' similar in idea to the `` inverse soft limits '' which appeared much more recently in  @xcite .",
    "our work establishes the validity of the ansatz conjectured in  @xcite and demonstrates that it arises naturally in twistor space .",
    "here we introduce a formula for the @xmath0-graviton mhv scattering amplitude which we call the `` tree formula '' since it consists of a sum of terms , each of which is conveniently represented by a tree diagram .",
    "the tree formula manifests an @xmath1 subgroup of the full permutation group . for the moment we choose to treat particles @xmath19 and @xmath0 as special . with this arbitrary choice",
    "the formula is : @xmath20 to write down an expression for the @xmath0-point amplitude one draws all inequivalent connected tree graphs with vertices labeled @xmath21 .",
    "( it was proven by cayley that there are precisely @xmath22 such diagrams . ) for example , one of the 125 labeled tree graphs contributing to the @xmath23 graviton amplitude is    ( 120,100)(0,0 ) ( 30,50)(110,50 ) ( 30,50)(1.7157,21.7157 ) ( 30,50)(1.7157,78.2843 ) ( 1.7157,21.7157)101 .",
    "( 1.7157,78.2843)101 .",
    "( 30,50)101 .",

    "( 110,50)101 .",
    "( 1.7157,21.7157)(0,0)@xmath24 ( 1.7157,78.2843)(0,0)@xmath25 ( 30,50)(0,0)@xmath26 ( 70,50)(0,0)@xmath27 ( 110,50)(0,0)@xmath28    according to  ( [ eq : main ] ) the value of a diagram is then the product of three factors :    1 .",
    "an overall factor of @xmath29 , 2 .   a factor of @xmath30 for each propagator connecting vertices @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and 3 .   a factor of @xmath33 for each vertex @xmath31 , where @xmath34 is the degree of the vertex ( the number of edges attached to it ) .",
    "an alternate description of the formula may be given by noting that a vertex factor of @xmath35 may be absorbed into each propagator connected to that vertex .",
    "this leads to the equivalent formula @xmath36      we defer to section iv a formal proof of the tree formula as the impatient reader may be sufficiently convinced by seeing the formula in action here for small @xmath0 and by noting that it has the correct soft limits for all @xmath0 , as we discuss shortly .",
    "for each of the trivial cases @xmath37 there is only a single tree diagram , @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , which immediately reproduce the correct expressions .    for @xmath40",
    "there are three tree diagrams @xmath41 which can easily be verified by hand to sum to the correct expression .",
    "agreement between the tree formula and other known formulas such as  ( [ eq : ms ] ) may be checked numerically for slightly larger values of @xmath0 by assigning random values to all of the spinor helicity variables .",
    "a simple implementation of the tree formula in the mathematica symbolic computation language is presented in the appendix .",
    "the mhv tree formula is evidently quite different in form from most other expressions in the literature . in particular",
    ", no reference at all is made to any particular ordering of the particles ( there is no vestigial `` @xmath15 '' ) , and the manifest @xmath1 arises not because of any explicit sum over @xmath42 but rather from the simple fact that the collection of labeled tree diagrams has a manifest @xmath1 symmetry . in our view",
    "these facts serve to highlight the essential `` gravitiness '' of the formula , in contrast to expressions such as  ( [ eq : ms ] ) which are ultimately recycled from yang - mills theory",
    ".    one interesting feature of the mhv tree formula is that it is , in a sense , minimally non - holomorphic .",
    "graviton mhv amplitudes , unlike their yang - mills counterparts , do not depend only the holomorphic spinor helicity variables @xmath43 .",
    "the tree formula packages all of the non - holomorphicity into the @xmath44 factors associated with propagators in the tree diagrams .",
    "each diagram has a unique collection of propagators and a correspondingly unique signature of @xmath45 s , which only involve @xmath46 of the @xmath0 labels .    like the mhv tree formula",
    ", the mason - skinner formula  ( [ eq : ms ] ) ( unlike most other formulas in the literature , including the original bgk formula ) has non - holomorphic dependence on only @xmath46 variables . in our labeling of  ( [ eq : ms ] ) we see that @xmath47 and @xmath48 do not appear at all . of course we do not mean to say that @xmath5 is `` independent '' of these two variables since there is a suppressed overall delta function of momentum conservation @xmath49 which one could use to shuffle some @xmath50 s into others .",
    "rather we mean that the tree and ms formulas have the property that all appearance of two of the @xmath50 s has already been completely shuffled out .",
    "it is an illuminating exercise to attempt a direct term - by - term comparison of the mhv tree formula with the ms formula  ( [ eq : ms ] ) .",
    "for the first non - trivial case @xmath40 the ms formula provides the two terms @xmath51 if we now expand out the bracket @xmath52 then we find four terms : one of them is proportional to @xmath53 and is identical to the first line in  ( [ eq : fivepoint ] ) , another proportional to @xmath54 is identical to the last line in  ( [ eq : fivepoint ] ) .",
    "the remaining two terms are both proportional to @xmath55 and may be combined as @xmath56 which with the help of a schouten identity we recognize as precisely the second line in  ( [ eq : fivepoint ] ) .",
    "we beg the reader s pardon for allowing us to indulge in one final example . expanding the ms formula for @xmath57 into @xmath58 s and",
    "@xmath59 s yields a total of 36 terms .",
    "for example there are 6 terms proportional to the antiholomorphic structure @xmath60 , totalling @xmath61.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] after repeated use of schouten identities this amazingly collapses to the single term @xmath62    we believe that these examples are representative of the general case . expanding out all of the brackets in the @xmath0-graviton ms formula generates a total of @xmath63 ^ 2 $ ] terms , but there are only @xmath22 possible distinct antiholomorphic signatures .",
    "collecting terms with the same signature and repeatedly applying schouten identities should collapse everything into the terms generated by the mhv tree formula .",
    "note that this is a huge simplification : @xmath22 is smaller than @xmath63 ^ 2 $ ] by a factor that is asymptotically @xmath64 .",
    "we certainly do not have an explicit proof of this cancellation ; instead we are relying on fact that the ms formula and the tree formula are separately proven to be correct in order to infer how the story should go .    to conclude this discussion",
    "we should note that we are exploring here only the structure of the various formulas , not making any claims about the computational complexity of the mhv tree formula as compared to  ( [ eq : ms ] ) or any other known formula .",
    "no practical implementation of the ms formula would proceed by first splitting all of the brackets as we have outlined .",
    "indeed a naive counting of the number of terms , @xmath8 in  ( [ eq : ms ] ) versus @xmath22 for the tree formula , suggests that for computational purposes the former is almost certainly the clear winner despite the conceptual strengths of the latter .",
    "let us consider for a moment the component amplitude @xmath65 with particles @xmath19 and @xmath0 having negative helicity .",
    "the universal soft factor for gravitons is  @xcite @xmath66 it is simple to see that the mhv tree formula satisfies this property : the tree diagrams which do not vanish in the limit @xmath67 are those in which vertex 1 is connected by a propagator to a single other vertex @xmath68 .",
    "such diagrams remain connected when vertex 1 is chopped off , leaving a contribution to the @xmath19-graviton amplitude times the indicated factor @xmath69 .",
    "thinking about this process in reverse therefore suggests a simple interpretation of  ( [ eq : soft ] ) in terms of tree diagrams  it is a sum over all possible places @xmath68 where the vertex 1 may be attached to the @xmath19-graviton amplitude .",
    "this structure is exactly that of the `` inverse soft factors '' suggested recently in  @xcite , and we have checked that the mhv tree formula may be built up by recursively applying the rule proposed there .",
    "before turning to the formal proof of the tree formula in the next section , here we work out the link representation of the mhv graviton amplitude in twistor space , which was one of the steps which led to the discovery of the tree formula .",
    "two papers  @xcite have recently constructed versions of the bcf on - shell recursion relation directly in twistor space variables . we follow the standard notation where @xmath70 , @xmath71 are respectively fourier transform conjugate to the spinor helicity variables @xmath72 , @xmath50 , and assemble these together with a four - component grassmann variable @xmath73 and its conjugate @xmath74 into the @xmath75-component supertwistor variables @xmath76 in the approach of  @xcite , in which variables of both chiralities @xmath77 and @xmath78 are used simultaneously , an apparently important role is played by the link representation which expresses an amplitude @xmath5 in the form @xmath79.\\ ] ] here one splits the @xmath0 particles into two groups , one of which ( labeled by @xmath68 ) one chooses to represent in @xmath77 space and the other of which ( labeled by @xmath80 ) one chooses to represent in @xmath78 space .",
    "the integral runs over all of the aptly - named link variables @xmath81 and we refer to the integrand @xmath82 as the link representation of @xmath5 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the bcf on - shell recursion in twistor space involves nothing more than a simple integral over @xmath77 , @xmath78 variables with a simple ( and essentially unique ) measure factor .",
    "the original motivation for our investigation was to explore the structure of link representations for graviton amplitudes .",
    "we will always adopt the convenient convention of expressing an n@xmath83mhv amplitude in terms of @xmath84 @xmath77 variables and @xmath85 @xmath78 variables .",
    "the three - particle mhv and @xmath86 amplitudes @xmath87 seed the on - shell recursion , which is then sufficient ( in principle ) to determine the link representation for any desired amplitude .    for example , the four - particle amplitude is the sum of two contributing bcf diagrams @xmath88 where we use the notation @xmath89 remarkably the two terms in  ( [ eq : fourp ] ) combine nicely into the simple result presented already in  @xcite : @xmath90 this simplification seems trivial at the moment but it is just the tip of an iceberg . for larger @xmath0 the enormous simplifications discussed in the previous section , which are apparently non - trivial in physical space , occur automatically in the link representation .    for example",
    "the five particle mhv amplitude is the sum of three bcf diagrams , @xmath91 which nicely simplifies to @xmath92 this expression already exhibits the structure of the mhv tree formula ( except that here particles 1 and 2 are singled out , and the vertices of the trees are labeled by @xmath93 ) .",
    "subsequent investigations for higher @xmath0 reveal the general pattern which is as follows .",
    "returning to the convention where particles @xmath19 and @xmath0 are treated as special , the link representation for any desired mhv amplitude may be written down by drawing all tree diagrams with vertices labeled by @xmath94 and then assigning    1 .",
    "an overall factor of @xmath95 , 2 .   for each propagator connecting nodes @xmath31 and @xmath32 , a factor of @xmath96 , 3 .   for each vertex @xmath31 , a factor of @xmath97 , where @xmath34 is the degree of the vertex labeled @xmath31 .",
    "it is readily verified by direct integration over the link variables that these rules are precisely the link - space representation of the physical space rules for the mhv tree formula given in the previous section .",
    "here we present a proof of the mhv tree formula .",
    "one way one might attempt to prove the formula would be to show directly that it satisfies the bcf on - shell recursion relation  @xcite for gravity  @xcite , but the structure of the formula is poorly suited for this task .",
    "instead we proceed by considering the usual bcf deformation of the formula @xmath98 by a complex parameter @xmath2 and demonstrating that @xmath99 has the same residue at every pole ( and behavior at infinity ) as the similarly deformed graviton amplitude , thereby establishing equality of the two for all @xmath2 .    in this section",
    "we return to singling out particles 1 and 2 , letting the vertices in the tree diagrams carry the labels @xmath100 .",
    "then the mhv tree formula  ( [ eq : main ] ) can be written as @xmath101 ( note that we continue to work with the component amplitude  ( [ eq : component ] ) ) where the factors @xmath102 associated with the propagators of a diagram are independent of 1 and 2 .",
    "let us now make the familiar bcf shift  @xcite @xmath103 which leads to the @xmath2-deformed mhv tree formula @xmath104^{\\deg(a)-2}.\\ ] ] here we are in a position to observe a nice fact : since each tree diagram is connected , the degrees satisfy the sum rule @xmath105 which guarantees that each individual term in  ( [ eq : deformedm ] ) manifestly behaves like @xmath16 at large @xmath2 .",
    "this exceptionally soft behavior of graviton amplitudes is completely hidden in the usual feynman diagram expansion .",
    "-point mhv amplitude .",
    "only the first diagram contributes to the residue at @xmath106.,title=\"fig : \" ] -0.5 cm    a complex function of a single variable which vanishes at infinity is uniquely determined by the locations of its poles as well as its residues .",
    "having noted that  ( [ eq : deformedm ] ) has the correct behavior at large @xmath2 , we can conclude the proof of the mhv tree formula by demonstrating that  ( [ eq : deformedm ] ) has precisely the expected residues at all of its poles . in order to say what the expected residues are we shall use induction on @xmath0 . as discussed above the tree formula",
    "is readily verified for sufficiently small @xmath0 , so let us assume that it has been established up through @xmath19 .",
    "we can then use bcf on - shell recursion ( whose terms are displayed graphically in  ) to determine what the residues in the deformed @xmath0-point amplitude ought to be .    without loss of generality",
    "let us consider just the pole at @xmath107 .",
    "the only tree diagrams which contribute to the residue at this pole are those with @xmath108 , meaning that the vertex labeled 3 is connected to the rest of the diagram by a single propagator .",
    "chopping off vertex 3 gives a subdiagram with vertices labeled @xmath109 .",
    "clearly all diagrams which contribute to this residue can be generated by first considering the collection of tree diagrams with vertices labeled @xmath109 and then attaching vertex @xmath26 in all possible ways to the @xmath110 vertices of the subdiagram .",
    "we therefore have @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes that we have dropped terms which are nonsingular at @xmath113 , the sum over @xmath32 runs over all the places where vertex 3 can be attached to the subdiagram , and @xmath114 indicates all edge factors associated the subdiagram , necessarily independent of 3 . using the schouten identity",
    "we find that @xmath115 so we have after a couple of simple steps ( and using  ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) ) @xmath116    on the other hand we know from the on - shell recursion for the @xmath0-point amplitude that the residue at @xmath117 comes entirely from the first bcfw diagram in  , whose value is @xmath118 where @xmath119 assuming the validity of the mhv tree formula for the @xmath19-point amplitude on the right , the expression  ( [ eq : temp ] ) evaluates to @xmath120 where @xmath121 . after simplifying this result with the help of  ( [ eq : phat ] ) we find precise agreement with  ( [ eq : agree ] ) , thereby completing the proof of the mhv tree formula .",
    "the tree formula introduced in this paper has several conceptually satisfying features and almost completely fulfills the wish - list outlined in the introduction .",
    "it appears to be a genuinely gravitational formula , rather than a recycled yang - mills result .",
    "is it , finally , the end of the story for the the mhv amplitude , as the parke - taylor formula  ( [ eq : pt ] ) surely is for the @xmath0-gluon mhv amplitude ?    among the wish - list items the mhv tree formula fails only in manifesting the full @xmath18 symmetry . of course it is possible that there simply does not exist any natural more primitive formula which manifests the full symmetry .",
    "it is not obvious how one could go about constructing such a formula , but we can draw some encouragement and inspiration from the recent paper  @xcite which demonstrates how to write manifestly dihedral symmetric formulas for nmhv amplitudes in yang - mills theory as certain volume integrals in twistor space .",
    "different ways of dividing the volume into tetrahedra give rise to apparently different but equivalent formulas for nmhv amplitudes .",
    "the same goal can apparently also be achieved by writing the amplitude as a certain contour integral where different choices of contour produce different looking but actually equivalent formulas  @xcite .",
    "perhaps in gravity even the mhv amplitude needs to be formulated in a way which is fundamentally symmetric but which nevertheless requires choosing two of the @xmath0 gravitons for special treatment .    in yang - mills theory",
    "the only formula we know of which manifests the full dihedral symmetry for all superamplitudes is the connected prescription  @xcite which follows from witten s formulation of yang - mills theory as a twistor string theory  @xcite .",
    "perhaps finding fully @xmath18 symmetric formulas for graviton superamplitudes requires the construction of an appropriate twistor string theory for supergravity , an important question in its own right which has attracted some attention  @xcite . an important motivation for witten s twistor string theory",
    "was provided by nair s observation  @xcite that the parke - taylor formula  ( [ eq : pt ] ) could be computed as a current algebra correlator in a wzw model . the bgk formula ( essentially  ( [ eq : ms ] ) )",
    "can similarly be related to current correlators and vertex operators in twistor space  @xcite , but we hope that the new mhv tree formula might provide a more appropriate starting point for this purpose and perhaps shed some more light on a twistor - string - like description for supergravity .",
    "another obvious avenue for future research is to investigate whether any of the advances made here can be usefully applied to non - mhv amplitudes .",
    "unfortunately we have not yet found any very nice structure in the link representation for non - mhv graviton amplitudes .",
    "recently in  @xcite it was demonstrated how to solve the on - shell recursion for all tree - level supergraviton amplitudes , following steps very similar to those which were used to solve the recursion for supersymmetric yang - mills  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    "a crucial role was played by what was called the graviton subamplitude , which is the summand of an @xmath0-particle graviton amplitude inside a sum over @xmath122 permutations .",
    "the decomposition of every amplitude into its subamplitudes allowed for a very efficient application of the on - shell recursion since the same two legs could be singled out and shifted at each step in the recursion .",
    "unfortunately there is no natural notion of a subamplitude for the mhv tree formula , making it very poorly suited as a starting point for attempting to solve the on - shell recursion . in our view",
    "the fact that the tree formula apparently can neither be easily derived from bcf , nor usefully used as an input to bcf , suggests the possible existence of some kind of new rules for the efficient calculation of more general gravity amplitudes .",
    "the arrangement of supergravity amplitudes into ordered subamplitudes also proved very useful in  @xcite for the purpose of expressing the coefficients of one - loop supergravity amplitudes in terms of one - loop yang - mills coefficients .",
    "it would certainly be very interesting to see if any of aspects of the mhv tree formula could be useful for loop amplitudes in supergravity , if at least as input for unitarity sums  @xcite .",

    "<S> we present and prove a formula for the mhv scattering amplitude of @xmath0 gravitons at tree level . </S>",
    "<S> some of the more interesting features of the formula , which set it apart as being significantly different from many more familiar formulas , include the absence of any vestigial reference to a cyclic ordering of the gravitons  making it in a sense a truly gravitational formula , rather than a recycled yang - mills result , and the fact that it simultaneously manifests both @xmath1 symmetry as well as large-@xmath2 behavior that is @xmath3 term - by - term , without relying on delicate cancellations . </S>",
    "<S> the formula is seemingly related to others by an enormous simplification provided by @xmath4 iterated schouten identities , but our proof relies on a complex analysis argument rather than such a brute force manipulation . </S>",
