    "it is widely believed that diffusive shock acceleration is the mechanism from which cosmic rays get their energy .",
    "there are various models to account for the origin of cosmic rays below about @xmath2eev . at low energies ,",
    "up to about @xmath3 ev , supernova explosions into the interstellar medium give a reasonable and successful explanation for the data for protons . at higher energies ,",
    "several models have been proposed , most notably a galactic wind termination shock ( jokipii & morfill 1987 ) , and multiple shocks in an ensemble of ob superbubbles and young supernova remnants ( axford 1992 ) . a comprehensive ,",
    "albeit tentative , theory has been proposed by biermann ( 1993 and later papers ) that explains the cosmic ray spectrum , with its chemical abundances and the knee feature as resulting from a combination of supernova explosions into the interstellar medium , and supernova explosions into strong stellar winds of progenitor wolf - rayet stars ( biermann 1993 ; biermann & cassinelli 1993 ; biermann 1995 ) . above the `` ankle '' at about 3eev ( the ultra - high energy cosmic ray regime , called uhecr hereafter ) , a simultaneous change in spectrum and composition of the cosmic ray spectrum ( bird 1994 ) suggests a change of origin . as argued already by cocconi ( 1956 ) particles of higher",
    "energy need to come from outside our galaxy due to the very large larmor radius , and therefore need to be accelerated in extragalactic sources . here",
    "we concentrate on these high energy particles that almost certainly come from extragalactic sources .",
    "it is well known that the extragalactic cosmic ray spectrum must show the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff at about 60eev due to interactions with the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) , regardless whether protons , heavy nuclei or photons are considered as the energetic particles ( greisen 1966 ; zatsepin & kuzmin 1966 ) .",
    "pair production and the cosmological evolution of radiation backgrounds set limits for the distance of cosmic rays even at lower energies , thus any extragalactic model of cosmic ray origin must propose at least some sources in our cosmological neighborhood which can account for the highest energies . in an expansion of an earlier proposition by biermann & strittmatter ( 1987 ) which predicted maximum proton energies in active galaxies of @xmath4 ev , rachen & biermann ( 1993 ) developed a model to accelerate cosmic rays up to a few 100eev at strong shocks at the end of extended jets in powerful radio galaxies ( fr - ii radio galaxies , fanaroff & riley 1974 ) . it has been shown that even for a moderate proton content in the jets this model can generally account for the cosmic ray flux above the ankle , and is consistent with air shower data suggesting a takeover from heavy to light nuclei in this energy range ( rachen , stanev & biermann 1993 ) .",
    "it can be shown that this model can be extended to a maximum particle energy in the source of about @xmath5 ev ( biermann 1996 ) .",
    "one prediction of this particular model has been tested successfully , and that is the expected correlation of arrival directions of very high energy cosmic rays with the large scale distribution of radio galaxies , in the supergalactic plane ( stanev 1995 ; hayashida 1996 ) .",
    "however , the uncertain proton content of the jets , the energy limitation for cosmic rays due to the relatively small acceleration region in hot spots , the finite life time of hot spots , and the large distance of the closest well known fr - ii radio galaxy set strong constraints on the predictability of the model , and leaves room for other contributions to the highest energy cosmic rays . in particular , after the detection of a 320eev air shower by fly s eye ( bird 1994 ) , and another 200eev event by the agasa ground array ( hayashida 1994 ) , the various acceleration models have been critically reviewed ( elbert & sommers 1995 ; biermann 1996 ) and new models have been suggested .",
    "most of them are based on astrophysical objects whose physical properties are under controversial discussion , as the decay of topological defects ( bhattacharjee 1991 ; sigl , schramm & bhattacharjee 1994 ; protheroe & johnson 1996 ; protheroe & stanev 1996 ) , or rapid acceleration in gamma ray burst sources ( milgrom & usov 1995 ; vietri 1995 ; waxman 1995 ) , but the poor statistics of events above 100eev allows a variety of other explanations , including the earlier proposal of radio galaxy origin ( rachen 1995 ; stanev 1995 ; biermann 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "recent work shows that there could be sites for shock acceleration in extragalactic space alternative to the strongly constrained acceleration in radio galaxy hot spots . according to hydrodynamic simulations of large scale structure formation ( kang 1994a ;",
    "cen & ostriker 1994 ) , accretion shocks are formed in the baryonic component around non - linear structures collapsed from the primordial density inhomogeneities as a result of gravitational instability .",
    "those structures can be identified as pancake - like supergalactic planes , still denser filaments , and clusters of galaxies which form at intersections of pancakes , in any variants of the many cosmological models .",
    "they are surrounded by the hot gas heated by the accretion shocks and the particles can be accelerated to very high energies at these shocks via first order fermi process .",
    "kang , jones & ryu ( 1995 ) and kang , ryu & jones ( 1996 , krj96 hereafter ) suggested that the accretion shocks around the clusters of galaxies could be as fast as 10003000and so could be good acceleration sites for the uhecrs up to several 10eev , provided there is a turbulent magnetic field so that the diffusion is in the bohm limit , and if the magnetic field around the clusters is order of microgauss .",
    "we note here the maximum energy could be shifted to super - gzk values , if the field geometry is close to being quasi - perpendicular ( jokipii 1987 ) .",
    "the significance of the accretion shocks is that they are the largest and longest lived shocks in the universe , so that they naturally get past the primary factors normally limiting fermi acceleration to such high energies .",
    "especially the accretion shocks formed around the clusters of galaxies which have the deepest gravitational potential well are the strongest and thus could accelerate the particles to the maximum possible energy .",
    "independently norman , melrose & achterberg ( 1995 ) showed with the help of a similar argument that the shocks associated with the large - scale structure formation could accelerate the protons up to @xmath6eev if there is a primordial field of 110 nanogauss , or if microgauss field can be self - generated in shocks .    in the present study we have estimated the contribution of the cr protons from an ensemble of the cluster accretion shocks distributed in the universe by adopting some simple models for the accretion flows onto clusters , the strength , geometry , degree of irregularities of the magnetic field near the cluster accretion shocks , and the cosmological evolution of the cluster distribution .",
    "the details of the models will be given in  2 . in ",
    "3 the estimated cr proton spectrum has been compared with actual observations in order to see if the proposed origin could explain the energy spectrum of uhecrs with reasonable physical parameters and models .",
    "we discuss the implication of these results and models also in  3 .",
    "we adopt for the following @xmath7 and write the hubble constant as @xmath8 ; in numerical calculations we use @xmath9 .",
    "= 3.7 in      it is generally accepted that both galaxy distribution in the observed universe and matter distribution in numerically simulated universe in most of generic cosmological scenarios show sheetlike and filamentary structures on large scale ( de lapparent , geller & huchra 1991 ; melott 1987 ; white 1987 ) .",
    "numerical simulations based on even a hierarchical clustering model such as variants of cdm models also indicate that the dominant nonlinear structure is a network of filaments ( white 1996 ) and the filaments became longer , straighter and clumpier as the hierarchical collapse proceeds ( summers 1996 ) .",
    "clusters of galaxies , especially the richest ones , form mostly at the vertices where several filaments intersect .",
    "they grow nonlinearly by gravitationally attracting matter along the filaments and also strengthen and align the filaments at the same time .",
    "the dominance of filaments in the visual impression of large scale matter distribution could be understood _ in part _ by the facts that the filaments as mostly intersecting curves between pancakes should naturally have higher density contrast than pancakes themselves ( see west , villumsen & dekel 1991 ) , and that a simulated universe is most often presented as a two - dimensional projection or a slice cut where sheetlike structures can not be easily seen .",
    "it also depends to some degree on choosing a right level of density contrast .",
    "thus , for example , knots ( clusters ) will become dominant if one chooses to look at only the highest density peaks .",
    "although formation of shocks and subsequent heating of the gas by them , when matter accretes toward these large - scale coherent structures , are implicit in any cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , the visual impression of accretion shocks has became clear only after high resolution eulerian codes were introduced to the numerical cosmology ( ryu 1993 ; bryan 1995 ) .",
    "interested readers are referred to kang ( 1994b ) for the details of a comparison of various cosmological hydrodynamic codes .",
    "they have demonstrated the accretion shocks can be captured clearly in the simulations done by these high - resolution eulerian codes , while their existence is not so obvious in the simulations done by the particle codes based on the sph method ( see their figs . 5 ) .",
    "1 shows a slice cut through a simulated universe based on the standard cdm model previously reported by kang ( 1994a ) .",
    "readers are referred to their paper for the details of the cosmological model parameters , which should not be crucial to the current discussion .",
    "the left panel shows the x - ray luminosity modeled by @xmath10 and could be a representative distribution of x - ray clusters .",
    "being weighted toward the higher density region , this shows the knot - like distribution with some alignments of several knots into filaments / sheets .",
    "the right panel shows the gas temperature distribution .",
    "the hotter region of @xmath11k is represented by solid contour curves , while the colder region of @xmath12k by dotted contour curves .",
    "shocks can be seen clearly as strong gradients in temperature distribution , and they encompass the region of moderately overdense regions of sheetlike / filamentary structures . the most prominent cluster in the lower - left corner has been shown in fig . 1 of krj96 in which the velocity pattern clearly shows accretion flows from the background igm and along the filaments toward the cluster .",
    "these figures demonstrate that the accretion shocks associated with the large - scale coherent structures do indeed exist , even though any direct observations of such shocks have not been made yet .",
    "it is apparent from the diffusive shock acceleration theory that some particles are accelerated by these large - scale shocks .",
    "the accretion shocks around clusters of galaxies , being the fastest shocks generated by the deepest potential wells , are our focus in the present paper .      the temperature of the intracluster medium ( icm ) within a cluster can be obtained with a reasonable accuracy from the x - ray observations ( david 1993 ) .",
    "fortunately , important physical parameters such as the velocity of an accretion shock , the velocity dispersion of galaxies , and the depth of the potential well of the cluster can be related rather well with the icm temperature .",
    "thus one can deduce such parameters from the observed temperature of x - ray clusters , for example , by assuming that the gas is in a hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravitational potential due to total mass including both the dark and baryonic matter . here",
    "we take another approach in which one - dimensional ( 1d ) spherical collapse of clusters is modeled as the collapse of an initially overdense point - mass perturbation followed by the secondary infall of background medium .",
    "such models have been studied both semi - analytically ( fillmore & goldreich 1984 ; bertschinger 1985 ) and numerically ( ryu & kang 1996 ) .",
    "in such an accretion flow the infalling baryonic matter is stopped by a shock , while the collisionless matter forms many caustics . in this paper",
    "we assume that the evolution of clusters and the properties of the accretion shocks can be represented by such flows .",
    "although this 1d approach does not account for the virialization of the central region of clusters , we will show below essential characteristics of real clusters can be related with parameters of the accretion shock through this model .",
    "one can expect the evolution of such a flow and its accretion rate should be dependent upon the expansion of background universe for the given initial power spectrum of density perturbations ( @xmath13 is constant for a point - mass perturbation ) .",
    "the flow solution in an @xmath14 universe approaches a self - similar form ( bertschinger 1985 ) due to the scale - free nature of the problem and so can be treated analytically . in a low density universe ( @xmath15 ) , however , either open or flat with the cosmological constant , the solution is not self - similar and can be studied only numerically ( ryu & kang 1996 ) . here",
    "we will consider the accretion flows only in the einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath14 ) , and adopt the one - dimensional ( 1d ) , self - similar accretion given by bertschinger ( 1985 ) as an evolutionary model for clusters and the accretion shocks .",
    "since the solution is self - similar , the shock parameters such as the radius and velocity of the accretion shock , and the postshock gas temperature can be uniquely determined by a single parameter at a given epoch .",
    "for example , the mass contained inside the outermost caustic , @xmath16 at present epoch can be such a parameter . the radius and velocity of the accretion shock , and the postshock temperature at @xmath17 mpc",
    "are given by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively ( ryu & kang 1996 ) .",
    "the reason that @xmath21 is an interesting quantity will be given shortly .",
    "if one follows the evolution of a given perturbation , on the other hand , the length scale of the accretion flow which is proportional to the turn - around radius will grow with time as @xmath22 .",
    "the position of the shock , @xmath23 , in units of @xmath24 and the velocity of the shock , @xmath25 , in units of @xmath26 are fixed , so the shock radius and velocity for the same perturbation evolves as @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    here",
    "we attempt to relate the physical parameters of the accretion shocks with observed temperature of x - ray clusters which often represents the emission weighted temperature in the core within @xmath29 mpc .",
    "we note that the temperature of the postshock gas in the 1d self - similar solution increases toward the center , in fact , to infinity , while observed icm temperature distribution of most clusters is nearly isothermal , and in some cases shows a clear depression towards the center due to cooling .",
    "this discrepancy comes about , because the extrapolation of the self - similar evolution to @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is not valid during the initial collapse when the accreted mass is not much greater than the mass inside the initial perturbation .",
    "also the 1d self - similar solution does not account for the virialization of the core region .",
    "according to the 3d cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( crone , evrard & richstone 1994 ; kang 1994a ; navarro , frenk & white 1995 ) , the icm is shock heated to the virial temperature and then settles into hydrostatic equilibrium with an approximate isothermal structure , which is consistent with the observed temperature distribution of the clusters .",
    "cosmological sph simulations ( navarro 1995 ; evrard , metzler & navarro 1995 ) showed that simulated clusters of different masses in fact have similar structures when scaled to a fixed density contrast ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "navarro also showed that the temperature profile of simulated clusters can be approximated within a factor of two by that of the 1d self - similar solutions for the outer region , @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the radius at @xmath35 ) , while the inner region , @xmath36 , is isothermal . from this consideration , we have made a simple approximation that the observed x - ray temperature of a cluster is similar to @xmath37 of the self - similar solutions , and so it provides the direct information about the shock velocity and radius from the self - similar solutions .    from the equations given",
    "above which relates @xmath23 , @xmath21 , and @xmath25 with the cluster mass @xmath38 and their redshift dependences , one can find them as a function of @xmath39 and @xmath40 in an @xmath14 universe as follows .",
    "@xmath41 evrard , on the other hand , showed that @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a _ conservative _ estimate for the boundary separating the inner virialized region from the outer infalling flow .",
    "they gave the scaling relation @xmath44 for clusters at @xmath45 for an @xmath14 universe .",
    "the fact that the ratio of the shock radius of the self - similar solution to the characteristic radius of virialized region in 3d simulation is @xmath46 seems reasonable , since @xmath23 corresponds to the radial position at @xmath47 and so it should be larger than @xmath42 . according to ryu & kang ( 1996 ) ,",
    "the clusters of a given temperature have smaller accretion velocity by less 20% for @xmath48 in either open or flat with @xmath49 universes .",
    "since we use observed temperature distribution for the cluster abundance to be discussed below , the main results of our model should remain valid for a low @xmath50 cosmology .    according to bertschinger ( 1985 ) , the gas density upstream to the shock is @xmath51 .",
    "thus all the shock parameters necessary for our model can be obtained from the observed redshift and x - ray temperature . in the following we adopt @xmath52 in all numerical calculations .",
    "the strength and morphology of the intergalactic magnetic fields remain largely unknown and observational tasks to detect them are very challenging even with today s technology ( see , for a review , kronberg 1994 ) .",
    "theoretical study on the generation of the primordial fields and their subsequent amplification during the structure formation is also still in its infancy . in fact",
    "it is not clear at all that there was a primordial magnetic field .",
    "recent study by kulsrud ( 1996 ) , however , showed that a weak seed field can be generated at shocks and then amplified via the protogalactic turbulence during the structure formation up to equipartition with the turbulence . an alternative theory ( biermann 1996 ) uses magnetic stellar winds as the sources of magnetic fields for galaxies and their environment . on observational fronts ,",
    "there exist some concrete observations that can be used in inferring the general distribution of the magnetic fields in intergalactic space .",
    "the current observational upper limit for a large - scale , pervading field is about @xmath53gauss ( kronberg 1994 ) , where @xmath54 is the assumed reversal scale of the magnetic field topology in units of 1 mpc .",
    "thus , if the reversal scale throughout the universe were larger than 1 mpc , such as @xmath55 mpc , the bubble - scale of the galaxy distribution , then this upper limit would be reduced by a factor of 6.3 ( for @xmath9 ) .",
    "the magnetic fields inside typical galaxies are observed to be order of 3 - 10@xmath56gauss , and magnetic fields near the @xmath56gauss level are also common in core regions of rich clusters according to many recent observations ( kim , tribble & kronberg 1991 ; taylor & perley 1993 ; taylor , barton & ge 1994 ) ; some cooling flow clusters clearly show magnetic fields even higher than those typical in the interstellar medium of galaxies ( see kronberg 1994 ) .",
    "studies on the field generation via dynamos in the cooling flows ( ruzmaikin 1989 ) and the field inputs from radio galaxies inside clusters ( enlin 1996 ) have attracted some attention recently .",
    "here we are concerned most with the fields near the accretion shocks on larger scale than cluster core , that is , within @xmath57mpc around clusters of galaxies .",
    "observation of such fields has been attempted by kim ( 1989 ) in which fields of 0.1 @xmath56gauss level were deduced _ in the plane of the supercluster _ connecting the coma cluster and a1367 by assuming equipartition between the magnetic fields and relativistic particles .",
    "this `` bridge '' of emission region of @xmath58mpc seems to be infalling toward the coma and is within the supergalactic plane ( so presumably inside the accretion shocks ) .",
    "valle ( 1990,1993 ) , on the other hand , suggested the existence of a magnetic field component of @xmath59gauss in a 10mpc region around the virgo cluster , in this case using an assumed length scale of 10 mpc .",
    "this might represent the fields outside the accretion shocks encompassing the supergalactic plane .",
    "here we adopt a simple , but common assumption that the icm magnetic field is in rough equipartition with the thermal energy of the gas .",
    "then the field strength in postshock region can be estimated from the thermal energy inside the shock ( in the postshock region ) according to @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "then the postshock field is given by @xmath64^{1\\over 2 } \\big[1+z\\big]^{3\\over 2 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath65 is a factor which controls the field strength in terms of the equipartition value , that is , @xmath66 means the equipartition between the field and thermal energies .",
    "for fiducial values of @xmath67 and @xmath9 , this gives for @xmath66 the fields of 0.52 - 1.64@xmath56gauss for @xmath68kev at @xmath45 .",
    "it is much harder to estimate the fields in the unshocked infalling flow upstream to the shock , so here we will simply assume @xmath69 for a turbulent field .",
    "we note here that the turbulent amplification of the field could generate some fields not only downstream but also upstream to the shocks due to turbulent nature of the flows ( kulsrud 1996 ) .",
    "we consider two kinds of models for the particle diffusion .",
    "the theoretical minimum for the diffusion coefficient in a strongly turbulent field with parallel geometry ( the mean field is parallel to the flow direction ) is given by the bohm formula ( see , , drury 1983 ) .",
    "@xmath70 where @xmath71 is the gyroradius and @xmath72 is the velocity of the particle . on the other hand ,",
    "the minimum diffusion coefficient in the perpendicular shocks ( the mean field is perpendicular to the flow direction ) ( jokipii 1987 ) is given by @xmath73 for high energy particles , @xmath74 , so @xmath75 is smaller than @xmath76 by a factor of @xmath77 .",
    "the rate of diffusive acceleration is determined by the diffusion coefficients @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the diffusion coefficient parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field , respectively , and @xmath81 is the angle between the field and the shock normal ( jokipii 1987 )",
    ". here we will follow jokipii ( 1987 ) in assuming that @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the ratio of the mean free path parallel to the magnetic field to the gyroradius .",
    "this is the result from standard kinetic theory which does not take account of field - line meandering .",
    "the bohm diffusion coefficient corresponds to the case where the field is turbulent on a scale of @xmath71 _ at all momenta _ , so it is effectively equivalent to the case of @xmath85 and @xmath86 with a random distribution of the obliquity . on the other hand , the minimum diffusion coefficient in a perpendicular shock , which is referred as the jokipii diffusion throughout this paper , corresponds to the case of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the shock velocity in units of @xmath90 .",
    "the latter is derived from the condition that @xmath91 $ ] , which implies that the particles should be scattered before they drift through the shock .",
    "this condition is necessary to maintain the isotropy of the particle distribution .",

    "we further assume that the process with which the particles escape from the shock is momentum - independent , that is , the particle spectra injected into intergalactic ( ig ) space has the same shape of the proton spectra at the shock .",

    "since this escape process depends on the diffusion length , the particle spectrum injected into the ig space has a strong dependence on the momentum , that is , only highest energy particles with longest diffusion length can diffuse out from the shock .",

    "the evolution of cluster population can be calculated by using various methods based on so - called press - schechter formalism , if the background cosmology ( @xmath50 and @xmath144 ) and the initial density power spectrum are given ( eke , cole & frenk 1996 ; kitayama & suto 1996 ; bond & myers 1996 ) .",

    "theses studies as well as most numerical studies ( kang 1994a ; tsai & buote 1996 ) indicate that the standard cdm model of a critical density universe produces too many clusters compared to observed local cluster abundance .",

    "( castander 1995 ; ebeling 1995 ) seem to indicate that clusters have evolved very little or not evolved at all in this redshift range , which is more consistent with low bias or low density models .    in order to model the distribution of cosmological population of clusters , first we adopted a temperature distribution function of clusters given by henry and arnaud ( 1991 ) which was derived from the observed local clusters .",
    "the number density in unit comoving volume at the present is given by for @xmath148110kev , @xmath149 secondly , we made a simple assumption that the comoving density of cluster evolves as a power - law of a scale factor , @xmath150 , that is , @xmath151 .",

    "it has been pointed out that the characteristic spikes occurring in @xmath173 close to the cutoff are exaggerated because of the continuous loss approximation ( yoshida & teshima 1993 ; protheroe & johnson 1996 ) . in the integration over redshift , however , those features are smoothed out , and it should only be noted that the cutoff is not quite as sharp as proposed by this method .",

    "we note from fig .  3 , however , that the transition from quasi - perpendicular jokipii diffusion to bohm diffusion does not lead to a linear decrease of @xmath102 , so that the model can work also for moderately oblique shocks with @xmath178 .",

    "the reduction of the field from the equipartition by a factor of up to two , however , still can give a reasonable fit to the observations .",
    "= 7.7 in    = 7.7 in      we need to consider why nature would choose an injection efficiency at a level of order @xmath1 .",
    "it is believed that a supernova blast wave can transfer a few ( @xmath187% of the explosion energy into the cosmic ray component and the particles accelerated by the remnant shock are injected into the interstellar medium when the shock either decays into a sonic wave or breaks up due to various instabilities .",
    "it would be natural to assume that a similar fraction of the kinetic energy of the infalling flow is likely to be transferred to the crs . unlike a supernova blast wave which expands from a point - like explosion into the interstellar space , however , an accretion shock forms due to the converging flow associated with gravitational collapse . the particles will be mostly confined near the shock and so the escape of particles by swimming against infalling flows upstream will be very rare .",
    "this calls for some physical models of escape of crs from the cluster shocks which can explain that only a few percent of accelerated particles ( which contains only a few percent of the infall energy ) is injected into the intergalactic space . here",
    "we must note that the escape process can not be energy dependent , because then the spectrum could not match the observations . in case of galactic cosmic rays which travel against the solar wind to reach the earth ,",
    "strong attenuation is severely energy dependent , and so the solar wind does not provide a good example apparently .    for clusters which are connected with filaments or supergalactic planes , the particles can escape from the clusters along the filaments / sheets since the field lines are mostly likely parallel along those structures according to the flow velocity inside the filaments / sheets ( see , for example , fig . 1 of krj96 ) .",
    "in such a picture the low apparent efficiency is simply a measure of the difficulty of feeding the particles into the sheets from the surrounding of a cluster .",
    "if this conjecture is right , the arrival direction of uhecrs should show a correlation with the supergalactic plane , and so identifying a source cluster with a particular cr event may become less stringent .",
    "the particles can also leak when the accretion shock becomes unstable and breaks up temporarily due to strong activities of agns inside the cluster .",
    "this could be the only possible escape route for the particles accelerated by isolated clusters which are not part of superclusters .",
    "the issue is closely related with the topology and the turbulent nature of the magnetic fields in the sheets , filaments and around clusters and will be discussed in upcoming papers .",
    "for our model to work , the magnetic field just outside clusters of galaxies must be of order 0.1 microgauss , but can not be less , since then the larmor radius condition would fail , the particles could not be contained .",
    "does this imply that we require a primordial magnetic field ?",
    "we note that in the evolution of clusters , repeated formation of giant radio galaxies is likely , and they can break out and pollute the environment over very large distances with magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , with such a model tracing the large scale magnetic fields to very large radio galaxies , one would not need a primordial magnetic field .",
    "of course , a primordial magnetic field would have to be weaker than the observational constraints , given by the cosmological limits on the faraday rotation of distant radio sources ; a primordial magnetic field is likely nearly homogeneous inside the bubble structure of the galaxy distribution , and so an upper limit of @xmath188picogauss would obtain , with a substantial strengthening towards the spatial environment near to clusters .",
    "if we use an inverse parker wind model ( as an analogy to the expansion of the gas from a radio galaxy ) to do such an extrapolation , scale the magnetic field strength inversely with the distance to a cluster , then such an upper limit is just about compatible with the magnetic fields required by our model .    in conclusion",
    ", we can not decide between the two possibilities , a primordial magnetic field , and one that derives from radio galaxies , or some other sources such as normal galaxies , even on the large scale .",
    "the accretion shock produces cosmic rays scaling with the overall energetics of the cluster , but with only some fraction of the shock kinetic energy ; thus the energy density of cosmic rays inside clusters is expected to be less than 10% of the thermal energy content in our model of the intracluster medium . on the other hand , the cosmic rays injected from radio galaxies may produce magnetic field strengths and energy densities of cosmic rays close to equipartition : enlin ( 1996 ) proposed that radio galaxies can push the cosmic ray content in clusters to the stability limit such as is believed to happen in the interstellar medium due to supernova explosions ( see , parker 1969 for a review ) . as demonstrated by enlin ( 1996 )",
    "these two alternatives may be decidable in the near future with gamma - ray observations due to the pion decay production in pp - collisions .",
    "there is a study of the haverah park events by stanev ( 1995 ) , which shows that the arrival directions of the uhecrs are not uniform , but seem to show positive correlations with the supergalactic plane ; a related study of the agasa events by hayashida ( 1996 ) supports a connection between the supergalactic plane and the arrival directions of at least a significant fraction of uhe crs .",
    "this supports models for the extragalactic origin of the highest energy cosmic rays , especially the ones in which the sources are likely to be associated with the supergalactic plane .",
    "they include radio galaxies and cluster accretion shocks .",
    "we have looked at the distribution of local clusters ( @xmath147 ) and generated a map of the cluster accretion shocks weighted by the particle flux above a few times @xmath189 eev ( kang , rachen & biermann 1996 ) .",
    "the map shows the similar degree of correlations with the supergalactic plane as the arrival directions of the uhecrs found in stanev ( 1995 ) and hayashida ( 1996 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that rich clusters beyond the local supergalactic plane ( @xmath190mpc ) such as the coma ( 8.3kev ) , perseus ( 6.3kev ) , 3c129 ( 6.2kev ) , a3571 ( 7.6kev ) , and centaurus ( 3.9 kev ) clusters are at low supergalactic latitudes .",
    "these rich clusters are dominant contributors of uhe crs according to our model .",
    "the virgo cluster is the most prominent cluster in the local supercluster , but its temperature is only only 2.4 kev .",
    "thus its contribution through the accretion shock is important only for energies below gzk cutoff ; of course , it may have an additional contribution from its radio galaxies .      concerning the events above 100eev",
    ", the present model can give a straightforward explanation for the enhancement of highest energy events detected by the haverah park experiment at high north galactic latitudes ( see stanev 1995 , and references therein ) , since the virgo and coma clusters are in that direction .",
    "on the other hand , the applicability of the hot spot acceleration model to the center - brightened radio galaxies m87 harbored by the virgo cluster is not yet clear . whether the 320eev fly s eye event",
    "may be explained in the context of cluster accretion shock acceleration , remains to be investigated .",
    "the awm7 cluster ( @xmath191kev , @xmath192 ) might be the closest rich cluster to the general direction of this event .",
    "alternatively , there is a candidate radio galaxy , 3c134 ; its redshift is unknown due to obscuration , but its distance can be estimated from radio size - luminosity relations to be in the range @xmath193mpc , thus it may well be the closest fr - ii radio galaxy ( rachen 1995 ) .",
    "this estimate has been recently confirmed by an infrared detection of the central galaxy ( hartmann 1996 ) .",
    "all in all , since the maximum energy of acceleration may vary strongly between individual objects in both models , one may have to consider both possibilities in the explanation of the highest energy events .",
    "the studies on the expected cr spectrum and distribution from galaxy cluster accretion shocks seem to give strong evidences for a significant uhecr contribution , which could reach up to the highest observed energies .",
    "some aspects of the model need further detailed considerations , however , since it has to rely on several somewhat speculative assumptions",
    ". a first question could be if one can prove observationally the existence of large - scale accretion shocks around clusters .",
    "although the shocks and the hot component of igm can be clearly seen to exist in most of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , independent of the details of cosmological models ; it is observationally challenging to detect such shocks because the hot gas does not radiate or absorb photons at a detectable level .",
    "but the hot gas of @xmath194k heated by the large - scale accretion shocks seems to be a major component of the intergalactic medium in the simulated universes ( nath & biermann 1993 ; ostriker & cen 1996 ) .",
    "one can also ask if the model would work for lower density universes such as open cdm models and flat cdm models with cosmological constant , because it is expected that the accretion flows are weaker in such cosmologies .",
    "another crucial assumption for our model is the magnetic field in equipartition with the thermal energy in the vicinity of accretion shocks .",
    "the general topology and turbulent nature of the large - scale magnetic field are also closely related with our particle diffusion model and the escape process .",
    "we note that the jokipii expression for the possible range of the diffusion coefficient in an oblique shock geometry has been derived going to the absolute limit of what is geometrically possible ; it may be an extreme overstatement of the limit relevant in nature .",
    "therefore , we emphasize that we use this as an assumption going into the modelling . on the other hand ,",
    "considering the loss time scale and comparing the two limits , bohm and jokipii ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the maximum energy possible is only moderately changed , even when we are 1/3 of the way between jokipii and bohm limits .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the speculative nature of the jokipii _ limit _ has relatively little influence on our essential result , as long as nature allows us to go two thirds of the way towards jokipii s limit .",
    "this demonstrates that the theoretical studies on how a magnetic field is generated and amplified during the structure and galaxy formation ( kulsrud 1996 ; ryu , kang & biermann 1996 ; biermann 1996 ) , as well as the observational studies on how the real magnetic field in the igm is distributed are very important to further development of our model .",
    "we thank d. ryu for helpful discussion on the self - similar evolution of clusters and comments on the manuscript .",
    "we are grateful to l. drury , the referee , for critical review of our paper ."
