    "for this reason , we can not establish the number of observed flares and their duration , therefore we can not use this information to compare the observed lightcurve with that calculated with the clumpy wind model of @xcite , as has been done in previous work @xcite . however , it is possible to compare the observed cumulative luminosity distribution out of eclipse with that calculated with the clumpy wind model . for the former , the _",

    "for the latter , we adopted the physical parameters for the o8.5i primary and the neutron star secondary reported above , and the force multiplier parameters ( see * ? ? ? * ) obtained by @xcite for a o8.5i star ( @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 ) .",

    "the obtained low value of the terminal velocity can be explained as follows : when the wind is highly ionized by the x - ray photons emitted by the neutron star , the high ionization modifies the dynamics of the line - driven stellar wind of ob supergiants ( especially in close binary systems ) , leading to a reduction of the wind velocity in the direction of the neutron star ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the mass loss rate is lower than the typical mass loss rate of o8.5i stars , which is of the order of @xmath192m@xmath138yr@xmath8 @xcite , but in agreement with the hypothesis that the mass loss rates derived from homogeneous - wind model measurements with the h@xmath193 method are overestimated by a factor of 210 if the wind is clumpy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that the x - ray variability of  is not totally due to the accretion of an inhomogeneous wind .",
