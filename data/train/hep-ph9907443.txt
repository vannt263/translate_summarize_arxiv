    "emission and absorption of soft particles cause hardly any recoil to an energetic source .",
    "surprisingly , this trivial fact gives rise to a great deal of simplification in quantum field theoretical calculations .",
    "this is the subject we wish to review in the article .",
    "such a source with an energy @xmath1 may be _ relativistic _ when @xmath2 is large and @xmath3 is small , or _ non - relativistic _ when @xmath2 is small and @xmath3 is large .",
    "for example , a high - energy quark is a relativistic source of gluons , and a heavy nucleus at rest is a non - relativistic source of soft pions .",
    "the origin of this simplification is a _ decomposition formula _",
    "@xcite for the tree amplitude @xmath4 of @xmath5 identical bosons .",
    "this formula allows @xmath4 to be decomposed into a sum of products of _ irreducible amplitudes _",
    "@xmath6 , where @xmath3 runs from 1 to @xmath5 , labeling the number of bosons in it .",
    "the number @xmath7 of irreducible factors in each term again varies from 1 to @xmath5 , but to preserve the total number of bosons emitted the condition @xmath8 must be obeyed .",
    "an irreducible amplitude @xmath6 differs from a feynman tree amplitude @xmath9 only in having the product of vertex factors @xmath10 in @xmath9 replaced by their nested commutator @xmath11\\cdots]]]$ ] in @xmath6 .",
    "the decomposition formula is combinatorial in nature and will be discussed more fully in sec .",
    "it is valid whatever @xmath12 s are , and whether the bosons are on - shell or off - shell .",
    "the latter makes it possible for the tree diagram in question to be a part of a much larger feynman diagram , thus allowing the decomposition of tree amplitudes to be applied fruitfully to loop diagrams as well .",
    "the vertex factors @xmath12 are matrices causing a change in the spin and internal quantum numbers of the energetic source after each emission ( or absorption ) .",
    "they are _ abelian _ if the spin and quantum numbers remain the same after each emission . in that case",
    "they are diagonal and commute with one another , so all @xmath6 vanish except @xmath13 . as a result , the @xmath5-boson amplitude @xmath4 is factorized into a product of @xmath5 single - boson amplitudes @xmath14 .",
    "such a decomposition for abelian vertices have been known for a long time under the name of an _ eikonal formula _ @xcite .",
    "it is often used to demonstrate the cancelation of infrared divergence in qed @xcite , and to establish the geometrical nature of a scattering amplitude at high energy @xcite .",
    "it is well documented in text books so we shall not discuss it any further until sec .  5 , when its recoil correction is considered .",
    "let us examine more carefully what decomposition means in the non - abelian context .",
    "we shall concentrate on the predominant situation when the vertices @xmath12 are generators of a lie group . in that case",
    "the emitted bosons carry the quantum numbers of the adjoint representation . since a nested commutator of generators is a generator",
    ", the @xmath3 bosons emitted in @xmath6 also carry a total quantum number in the adjoint representation .",
    "we may therefore think of these @xmath3 bosons together to form a _ quasi - particle _ , with the same quantum number as an original boson .",
    "the irreducible amplitude @xmath6 is then an amplitude for the emission of a single quasi - particle .",
    "for that reason we shall use the terms ` irreducible amplitude ' and ` quasi - particle amplitude ' interchangeably .",
    "the decomposition formula then says multi - quasi - particle amplitudes are always factorizable into products of single - quasi - particle amplitudes , much like the abelian case .",
    "thus the decomposition formula is also referred to as the _ factorization formula_. in this language the only difference between abelian and non - abelian vertices is that a quasi - particle in the abelian case is the original boson , whereas in the non - abelian case it may have a complicated structure consisting of many bosons .",
    "this difference is eventually responsible for the gluon to reggeize and not the photon , because the quasi - particle in high - energy scattering turns out to be just the reggeon . for more details",
    "see sec .  4 .",
    "the decomposition formula is able to simplify calculation in at least three ways .",
    "first , all the terms in @xmath4 with @xmath15 can be computed from @xmath6 with @xmath16 , which in turn can be computed from @xmath9 with @xmath16 . the only new term needed to be computed at order",
    "@xmath5 is the quasi - particle amplitude @xmath17 , thus reducing the labor of computation .",
    "secondly , factorization often allows @xmath4 of all @xmath5 to be summed up , typically into an exponential function of @xmath6 .",
    "this is important in problems where phase is of paramount concern , as in the unitarization of total cross section in sec .  4 , and the coherent reduction of radiation in the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect to be discussed later and in sec .  5",
    "thirdly , quite often all @xmath6 have the same order of magnitude @xmath18 , irrespective of what @xmath3 is .",
    "this will be the case for the examples discussed in secs .  3 and 4 .",
    "in that case terms with the product of @xmath7 irreducible amplitudes are of order @xmath19 , and it is important to note also that these are also terms with quantum numbers made up of @xmath7 adjoint objects .",
    "this correlation between the magnitude and the quantum number is useful as we shall illustrate in sec .",
    "3 . in particular , when @xmath20 , this means that magnitude is determined by the quantum number . to see that let @xmath21 be the set of internal quantum numbers first appearing in the tensor product of @xmath7 adjoint objects .",
    "for example , in the case when the internal quantum number is @xmath22 color , octet alone is in @xmath23 , whereas singlets , deculplets , anti - decuplets , and 27-plets are in @xmath24 . in this notation ,",
    "amplitudes belonging to @xmath21 is of order @xmath19 when @xmath20 .",
    "though small , such subdominant amplitudes can be extracted in this approach simply by multiplying @xmath7 dominant amplitudes @xmath6 together , each of order @xmath18 .",
    "this is not something that can be obtained in the usual way short of carrying out the very difficult task of calculating each feynman diagram to an accuracy of @xmath19 .",
    "these subdominant contributions are needed in sec .  4 to preserve the froissart bound when total cross section is extrapolated to asymptotic energies .",
    "these advantages of the decomposition formula will be illustrated with two concrete examples . in sec .  3 , we consider a source made up of @xmath25 constituents .",
    "that source may be a heavy nucleus emitting soft gluons @xcite , or a baryon emitting soft pions in a qcd theory with @xmath25 colors @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of each of the @xmath26 feynman diagram making up @xmath4 is of order @xmath27 , since each boson can be emitted from any of the @xmath28 constituents .",
    "it will be shown that the irreducible amplitude @xmath17 corresponds to emission of all @xmath5 pions from the _ same _ constituent , hence @xmath17 is of order @xmath29 , independent of @xmath5 .",
    "unless there are selection rules forbidding it , the individual bosons would like to be emitted from as many different constituents as possible to maximize the matrix element .",
    "this leads to the classical approximation used in the mclerran - venugopalan model @xcite . in the case",
    "when @xmath4 describes a scattering amplitude with one incoming and @xmath30 outgoing pions , terms in the decomposition with @xmath15 vanish .",
    "this is so because at least one of the @xmath7 irreducible factors must contain only outgoing pions , and by energy conservation this can not survive .",
    "since the only surviving term has @xmath31 , @xmath4 is of order @xmath32 @xcite , rather than the magnitude @xmath27 of each of its feynman diagrams .",
    "this enormous cancelation even for a moderate @xmath5 is not something one can easily obtained by calculating directly from the feynman diagrams .    in sec .",
    "4 we consider parton diffractive scattering in perturbative qcd , in the limit of small coupling @xmath33 , and high energy @xmath34 so that @xmath35 . the scattering amplitude @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is the impact parameter ) is no longer a tree , but it can still be decomposed into irreducible amplitudes @xmath38 using the tree decomposition for each of the two fast partons . the irreducible amplitude @xmath39 is characterized by the exchange of @xmath7 mutually interacting quasi - particles , and is of order @xmath40 , so once again we have a factor @xmath41 per quasi - particle . this observation will be used to devise a way to unitarize the bfkl - pomeron amplitude @xcite , so that the total cross section when extrapolated to asymptotic energies obey the froissart bound @xcite .",
    "so far we have neglected the recoil of the energetic source .",
    "we will consider how to include it in the abelian situation in sec .",
    "this is prompted by the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect in qed @xcite , which describes a suppression of radiation for a particle traversing in a dense medium .",
    "more specifically , consider an energetic electron with energy @xmath42 moving in a medium of scatterers spaced apart by a distance @xmath43 .",
    "let the energy of the emitted photon be @xmath44 , and the energy of the final electron be @xmath45 .",
    "neglecting the mass of the charged particle , the longitudinal momentum transfer in such a process is @xmath46 . if @xmath47 , emission from different scatters is coherent , as if it came from one source instead of many .",
    "this causes a suppression of radiation compared to the case when the emission is incoherent , when the intensity of emission is proportional to the number of scatters .",
    "this suppression is the lpm effect .",
    "since @xmath48 , we must also compute the influence of scatters to @xmath49 for consistency , and as we shall see in sec .",
    "5 , this calls for a recoil correction to the same order .",
    "consider a relativistic source moving parallel to the z - axis at nearly the speed of light .",
    "its transverse position @xmath50 and its lightcone distance @xmath51 are fixed provided the emission of particles causes no recoil .",
    "this classical picture holds even quantum mechanically for the following reason .",
    "let @xmath52 be the on - shell momentum of the energetic source after all emissions ( @xmath53 ) , and @xmath54 the outgoing momentum of the @xmath55th boson ( fig .  1 ) , with @xmath56 for every @xmath57 and every @xmath55 .",
    "then the propagators of fig .",
    "1 can be approximated by p(p+k ) , where @xmath58 is an appropriate sum of @xmath59 s and the term @xmath60 has been neglected compared to @xmath61 .",
    "the propagator in configuration space is obtained by fourier transform to be p(x)&&1(2)^4d^4(p+k)e^-i(p+k)x 1(p+k)^2-m^2+i + & & -i^+e^-ipx ^2(x_)(x^-)(x^+),where the lightcone coordinates",
    "are defined by @xmath62 . with this definition and with the mass of the source neglected , the only non - zero component of the source momentum",
    "may be taken to be @xmath63 .",
    "when the source particle propagates from @xmath64 to @xmath65 with @xmath66 , this expression confirms that the transverse and the lightcone positions of the particle are fixed , while its lightcone time @xmath67 goes forward as it propagates , as in the classical picture .    note that if the feynman propagator in is replaced by the cutkosky propagator",
    "@xmath68 $ ] , then the factor @xmath69 in is replaced by 1 .    for a non - relativistic source with @xmath70 ,",
    "the corresponding propagator becomes -i2me^-imx^0 ^ 3(x)(x^0 ) .      to conform to bose - einstein statistics , the emitted bosons in fig .",
    "1 must be symmetrized , with the full @xmath5-boson amplitude @xmath4 given by a sum of @xmath26 permuted diagrams . labeling these permuted diagrams by the order of their bosonic emissions , as in @xmath71=[\\s_1\\s_2\\cdots \\s_n]$ ] , so that fig .",
    "1 is @xmath72 $ ] , we have a_n=_[]s_na[]=_[]s_nv[]p [ ] , where the sum is taken over the set @xmath73 of all permutations of @xmath5 objects .",

    "the argument of this cutkosky propagator becomes @xmath80 .    in configuration space ,",
    "each feynman propagator is given by .",
    "the cutkosky propagator is given by the same formula with @xmath69 replaced by 1 .",
    "we shall denote the product of propagators in the configuration space by @xmath81 $ ] , so that the configuration - space amplitude is a_n=_[]s_nv[]p [ ] . to establish the decomposition formula , the most important factor in @xmath81 $ ] is @xmath82=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\theta(x_i^+-x_{i+1}^+)$ ] , where @xmath83 is the spacetime coordinate of the initial source if it is off - shell , and it is @xmath84 if it is on - shell .",
    "we shall denote the amplitude by @xmath85 when @xmath81 $ ] is replaced by @xmath82 $ ] .    before we proceed note that the propagator in contains no numerator factor .",
    "this implies that either helicity is conserved as in a vector - boson emission from a relativistic source , or that the spin - flip information is encoded in the vertex factor @xmath12 as in non - relativistic yukawa interaction . to illustrate how the numerator can formally be made to disappear ,",
    "suppose the energetic source to be a spin-@xmath86 particle .",
    "if @xmath87 is the momentum of the propagator , as in , then the numerator is @xmath88 .",
    "we then move the @xmath89 factor leftward and the @xmath90 factor rightward , and absorb them into the vertex factors @xmath91 . in this way the numerator factor can be made to disappear .",
    "to explain the decomposition formula , look at the simplest case when @xmath92 : a_2&=&v_1v_2+v_2v_1",
    "+ & = & ( + ) v_1v_2 + + & = & @xmath93v_1 $ ] @xmath94v_2$]+ , where the identity @xmath95+\\theta[21]=\\theta[1]\\theta[2]\\equiv \\theta(x_1^+-x_0^+ ) \\theta(x_2^+-x_0^+)$ ] has been used .",
    "we shall now write this formula in a way that can be generalized to all @xmath5 .",
    "for that purpose introduce the _ quasi - particle amplitude _ q[]&= & , which is obtained from the feynman amplitude @xmath96 $ ] by replacing the products in @xmath75 $ ] by their nested commutators .",
    "if @xmath97 are sequences of non - overlapping numbers , we will also let q[|||]=q[ ] q[]q[ ] .",
    "in other words , vertical bars ( or _ cuts _ ) are used to separate the factors into products .    with this notation",
    ", we can rewrite to be a_2&=&q[1|2]+q[21 ] .",
    "the general decomposition formula is given by @xcite a_n&=&_[]s_nq_c [ ] , where @xmath98 $ ] is by definition equal to @xmath99 $ ] with vertical bars suitably inserted into the argument @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "the rule for insertion is the following : a vertical bar is inserted after the number @xmath101 in @xmath71 $ ] if and only if there is no number to its right smaller than it .",
    "thus for example @xmath102=\\widetilde q'[1|2]$ ] , and @xmath103=\\widetilde q'[21]$ ] , so is a special case of .",
    "more complicated examples for @xmath104 are : @xmath105= \\widetilde q'[6431|2|85|7]= q'[6431]q'[2]q'[85]q'[7]$ ] , and @xmath106=q'[1|2|3|854|76]=q'[1]q'[2]q'[3]q'[854]q'[76]$ ] .",
    "these are illustrated graphically in fig .  2 , where a cut denotes factorization in the configuration space .",
    "we have also shown simplified versions where each quasi - particle is indicated by a single thick vertical line .",
    "note however from the remark in the paragraph following that in momentum space , a vertical means replacing the feynman propagator by the corresponding cutkosky propagator .    to obtain the decomposition formula for the full configuration - space amplitude @xmath107 ,",
    "we simply remove the prime on both sides of . to get the decomposition formula for the momentum - space amplitude @xmath4 ,",
    "we will remove the tilde on both sides as well . with or without tilde and/or prime ,",
    "@xmath108 is always related to @xmath109 by the same rule of insertion of vertical bars .",
    "it is the multi - quasi - particle amplitude ( also known as the _ non - abelian cut amplitude _ ) that factorizes according to the vertical bars into products of the irreducible single - quasi - particle amplitudes @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "the irreducible amplitude @xmath110 $ ] ( without vertical bars ) is always obtained from the feynman amplitude @xmath74 $ ] by replacing the products of @xmath12 s with their nested commutators .",
    "these are the quantities @xmath6 mentioned in the introduction , with @xmath3 being the length of @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to incorporate the decomposition formula into feynman diagrams by a slight modification of the latter .",
    "all that one has to do is to add cuts to the energetic tree(s ) according to the insertion rules .",
    "2 and 4 are examples of such _ non - abelian cut diagrams _ @xcite .",
    "ordinary feynman rules remain unchanged , except for two modifications .",
    "a cut propagator is a cutkosky propagator instead of a feynman propagator , and the product of vertex factors @xmath12 between cuts are changed into their nested commutators .",
    "note that individual feynman diagrams are not the same as individual cut diagrams , but according to and their permuted sums are equal .",
    "consider a non - relativistic source made up of @xmath28 constituents , with @xmath111 being the creation and annihilation operators for these constituents .",
    "bosons interact with the source through a vertex of the form @xmath112 .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath12 is of order @xmath113 , since each boson can be emitted from any of the @xmath28 constituents of the source .",
    "see fig .",
    "if we have a product of @xmath3 such operators , @xmath114 , then its matrix element is of order @xmath115 .",
    "in contrast , since @xmath116=\\psi^\\dagger[\\gamma_i,\\gamma_j ] \\psi$ ] , the matrix element of nested commutators of @xmath12 is of order @xmath117 .",
    "we may therefore identify the common magnitude @xmath18 with this number @xmath28 , if @xmath118 . since this nested commutator is still given by a one - body operator",
    ", we may interpret the irreducible or quasi - particle amplitude @xmath6 as describing emissions of the @xmath3 bosons from the same constituent in the source .    as discussed in the introduction",
    ", we may now conclude that the amplitude @xmath4 for the inelastic reaction _ 1+s_2+_3++_n+s , where the non - relativistic source @xmath119 is either a heavy nucleus or a baryon with @xmath25 colors , is of order @xmath120 , instead of @xmath121 when the reaction is described by tree amplitudes like figs .  1 and 3 .    in particular , for @xmath122",
    ", we obtain the effective coupling of the pion to the source to be @xmath123 . if the source @xmath119 is a baryon with a large color @xmath28 , it is known @xcite that @xmath124 so the yukawa coupling constant is @xmath125 . the interaction is then very strong .",
    "under such a circumstance , each feynman tree diagram is of order @xmath126 , and loop diagrams will be even larger .",
    "there seems to be no reason at all to be able to calculate the process using tree diagrams alone , yet doing so fairly realistic baryons can be obtained @xcite .",
    "what happens is that although individual tree diagrams are large , their sum gives rise to a small amplitude @xmath127 , so loop diagrams computed from @xmath4 are negligible .",
    "moreover , for large @xmath28 , meson - meson direct couplings are small , so sums of tree diagrams like figs .",
    "1 and 3 indeed dominates the whole reaction process in @xcite .",
    "in order to appreciate what decomposition can do for this process , let us first summarize what is known about the qcd calculation of this amplitude , at high energy @xmath34 and small momentum - transfer @xmath128 .    even assuming the qcd coupling @xmath129 to be very small , each loop integration is capable of producing a factor @xmath130 , so the additional factor for each loop is likely to be @xmath131 and not just @xmath129 . if @xmath35 which we shall assume from now on , loops of every order must be computed , and then summed .",
    "such a difficult task can usually be attempted only in the leading - log approximation , where the highest power of @xmath130 is kept at each order .",
    "this is equivalent to keeping only the lowest power of @xmath129 for fixed @xmath131 .",
    "such leading - log calculations have been carried out @xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution is of order @xmath129 ( for fixed @xmath35 ) , and is mediated by the exchange of a color - octet object known as the reggeized gluon , or reggeon for short . for a truly elastic scattering one",
    "needs a color - singlet exchange .",
    "that amplitude is of order @xmath132 and the effective object being exchanged is known as a bfkl pomeron .",
    "the dependence on @xmath131 is also known .",
    "this dependence leads to a total cross section @xmath133 growing like @xmath134 . extrapolated to a large @xmath135 , such a power growth violates unitarity and the froissart bound , which forbids any total cross section to grow faster than @xmath136 .",
    "this problem arises because we extrapolate the bfkl pomeron amplitude , correct for @xmath33 and @xmath35 , beyond its region of validity to very large @xmath135 . to cure the problem",
    "we must add the necessary subdominant terms before extrapolation .",
    "this is not unlike extrapolating the first born approximation valid for weak coupling , to a strong - coupling regime where contributions from higher born terms must be included . at high energy",
    "this task is somewhat simplified because there is an impact - parameter representation for the amplitude a(s,)&=&2isd^2be^i***b*a(s , b ) , + a(s , b)&=&1-e^2i(s , b ) .",
    "born approximation corresponds to small phase shift @xmath137 , whence the born amplitude @xmath138 in the impact - parameter space is proportional to @xmath137 .",
    "higher born approximations are given simply by powers of the phase shift .",
    "to simulate the problem encountered by the bfkl pomeron , onsider an interaction mediated by the exchange of a spin-@xmath139 particle with an interaction range @xmath140 .",
    "the phase shift at large @xmath37 has the form @xmath141 .",
    "it is small if @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "when @xmath135 becomes large , the phase shift is no longer small , so the full expression has to be used .",
    "the born approximation violates the froissart bound when extrapolated to large @xmath135 , but the full expression can be shown not to @xcite .",
    "this would be a good way to cure the problem of the bfkl pomeron if it could be interpreted as a phase shift .",
    "for this scenario to be true it is necessary to demonstrate that the correction terms are given by powers of the phase shift .",
    "unfortunately this is difficult to do , for factorization is not easy to prove by the usual means , and in any case in the region @xmath33 and @xmath35 where we have control , the correction terms are small and difficult to calculate .",
    "however , as discussed in the previous sections , multi - quasi - particle amplitudes do factorize , and within that formalism subdominant terms can also be calculated just by multiplying a number of dominating terms .",
    "so with the help of the decomposition formula it is at least hopeful that we may be able to interpret the bfkl - pomeron amplitude as a phase shift .",
    "the reality is actually more complicated .",
    "we shall summarize here what transpires and the detail can be found in ref .",
    "first we must find a decomposition formula suitabke for the parton - parton amplitude , by applying the result of sec .  2 to each of the two energetic partons . in the region of interest ,",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath35 , it turns out that the amplitude @xmath36 can be decomposed into sums of products of irreducible amplitudes @xmath144 .",
    "this is analogous to the situation in sec .  2 where the tree amplitude @xmath145 can be decomposed into sums of products of the irreducible amplitudes @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "the difference is that each @xmath110 $ ] is a single - quasi - particle amplitude , but @xmath38 is characterized by @xmath7 mutually interacting quasi - particles being exchanged in the @xmath146-channel , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the difference arises because gluon interaction was ignored in the tree amplitude considered in sec .",
    "when included , gluons within the same quasi - particle as well as those in different quasi - particles may interact , which is why single - quasi - particle amplitudes do not necessarily factorize anymore .",
    "nevertheless , each quasi - particle is still a color octet , and each would be associated with a common magnitude of the order of @xmath41 , in the sense that _",
    "k(s , b)=o(_s^k ) .",
    "the factorized multi - quasi - particle amplitudes of all orders can be summed up to an exponential form to yield the impact - parameter representation , with the phase shift given by ( s , b)=_k=1^_k(s , b ) .    to connect this with the bfkl - pomeron amplitude ,",
    "let us first use to conclude that the dominant amplitude for @xmath36 , in the region @xmath33 and @xmath35 , comes from @xmath147 and is of order @xmath129 . in this regime , @xmath148 is mediated by the exchange of a single color - octet quasi - particle .",
    "as stated in the beginning of this section , such a dominant octet amplitude is the reggeon amplitude , so we can simply identify the totality of single quasi - particles with a reggeon . to obtain a color - singlet amplitude ,",
    "at least two quasi - particles must be exchanged , in which case @xmath36 is dominated by a combination of @xmath149 and @xmath150 , both of order @xmath132 .",
    "the first term describes two non - interacting quasi - particles , and the second two mutually interacting ones .",
    "we may therefore identify the bfkl - pomeron amplitude with the color - singlet component of this two - quasi - particle amplitude .",
    "thus feynman diagrams can be summed up to give a unitary formula respecting the froissart bound , and the phase shifts @xmath147 and @xmath150 can be obtained from the leading - log reggeion and the bfkl - pomeron amplitudes .",
    "we might want to drop the @xmath39 for @xmath151 on the grounds that they are subdominannt according to , but they may no longer be small when @xmath135 is extrapolated .",
    "so far the propagator has been taken to be where all recoils are ignored . motivated by the need of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @xcite , we shall study in this section how to include recoil . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the lpm effect is of order @xmath152 , so recoil correction to this order has to be taken into account . in what follows we shall discuss how recoil can be incorporated into the propagator , how this correction affects abelian factorization , and finally how the new factorization can be summed up into an exponential form for the wave function .",
    "we will not carry this forward to discuss the lpm effect as such because discussions can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the factorization and the subsequent rendering of an exponential form is important because phase information , which is crucial for the radiation suppression contained in the lpm effect , is contained in the exponent .",
    "the treatment below parallels the discussion in ref .",

    "<S> quasi - particle can be made up of many bosons , though always with a total quantum number identical to that of a single boson . </S>",
    "<S> this decomposition enables certain amplitudes of all orders to be summed up into an exponential form , and it allows subleading contributions of a certain kind , which is difficult to reach in the usual way , to be computed . for bosonic emissions from a heavy source with many constituents , </S>",
