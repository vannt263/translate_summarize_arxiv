    "in uniform magnetic fields , a trajectory of a charged particle wraps around a magnetic flux , leading to the discretized orbital levels known as the landau levels . each level has degenerate states and the density of states is given by @xmath4 . also , spin-@xmath5 fermions are subject to the zeeman energy splitting , with which the @xmath6-th landau level ( @xmath6ll ) has the following spectrum at the tree level , @xmath7 where the magnetic fields are applied to the @xmath8-direction , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the electric coupling constant and the fermion mass , respectively .",
    "a remarkable aspect for the fermionic case is that the energy of the lowest landau level ( lll ) at @xmath11 does not depend on the value of @xmath2 , since the energy gained by the zeeman effect cancels out the zero point energy arising from the orbital motion . therefore _",
    "the @xmath2-dependence of the lll energy appears only through the radiative corrections_. those radiative corrections vary for different theories : our objective is to use such sensitivity to explore the structure of theories , especially quantum chromodynamics in the infrared ( ir ) regime .",
    "the characteristic scale is given by the qcd renormalization scale parameter , @xmath12 .",
    "( for an extensive review on magnetized systems , see ref .",
    "@xcite . )    the magnetic field we shall consider is strong , @xmath0 , perhaps much stronger than can be realized in experimental laboratories could reach @xmath13 @xcite , but this size is much smaller than other scales relevant at early epoch .",
    "magnetars have surface magnetic fields of electron mass scale and might have even larger magnetic fields at their cores by squeezing the surface fluxes , but how magnetic fluxes are distributed in magnetars remains an unsettled issue . ] ; the magnetic fields at rhic and lhc are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , and persist only for a short time @xcite .",
    "thus the applicability of our arguments to phenomenology is subtle , but it is not our primary purpose . the strong field regime has been studied in the lattice simulations @xcite , and we use them to test various theoretical concepts and methods of calculations , aiming at applications to other unexplored domain , e.g. , physics of cold and dense qcd . indeed , the similarities between the low energy dynamics of qcd at high density and in strong magnetic fields have been pointed out @xcite . for example , the `` qcd kondo effect '' , that is induced by the infrared instability near the fermi surface , was recently studied first in dense qcd @xcite , and then it was shown that the similarity between the fermi surface effect and the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional low energy dynamics in strong magnetic fields manifests itself as the `` magnetically induced qcd kondo effect '' @xcite .",
    "specific problems address in the present work are theoretical paradoxes observed in the recent lattice qcd studies .",
    "two problems can be thought of as the representatives : ( i ) _ the @xmath2-dependence of the chiral condensate _",
    "@xcite : the chiral effective models or chiral perturbation theory confirmed the magnetic catalysis @xcite and explain the lattice data at @xmath16 well , while beyond @xmath17 , their predictions start to deviate from the lattice results which show the linear rising behavior , @xmath18 .",
    "( ii ) _ inverse magnetic catalysis _",
    "@xcite : the ( 2 + 1)-flavor lattice results at the physical pion mass show that the chiral restoration temperature ( @xmath19 ) decreases at larger @xmath2 , by @xmath20 at @xmath21 , and this decreasing behavior continues to the maximal magnetic fields achieved on the lattice , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "typical model calculations @xcite instead predict the qualitatively opposite behavior : @xmath19 grows rather rapidly as @xmath2 increases .",
    "effective models leading to these paradoxes have certain common features .",
    "those models predict the dynamically generated quark mass , which is large ( @xmath23 ) and strongly @xmath2-dependent , e.g. , @xmath24 or @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the uv cutoff of the model ) .",
    "let us see how this estimate causes the aforementioned problems . at large @xmath2 ,",
    "the proper fermion bases are the ritus bases by using which one can include the background @xmath2 effects in the full order .",
    "the chiral condensate can be written as [ @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath29 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the two - dimensional propagator for the @xmath6-th ll . therefore if the mass gap rapidly grows as @xmath2 increases",
    ", the two - dimensional condensate @xmath31 also does .",
    "then @xmath32 no longer depends on @xmath2 linearly , contradicting with the lattice results .",
    "the estimate of @xmath33 also causes a problem for the critical temperature , because with such large mass gap the thermal fluctuations of quarks are not activated until the temperature reaches @xmath34 .",
    "then the chiral restoration temperature keeps growing as @xmath2 increases , contradicting with the inverse magnetic catalysis . due to the suppression of the quark fluctuations , it is also difficult to explain the @xmath2-dependence of various gluonic quantities observed in the lattice data @xcite .",
    "note also that in the lattice simulations the inverse magnetic catalysis can be observed only when the quark mass is sufficiently small near the physical point @xcite .    to cure these problems ,",
    "several authors have emphasized fluctuation effects of various kinds , including hadronic fluctuations @xcite or the back - reaction from quark to gluon sector @xcite . several elaborated model studies took into account these fluctuations , and it became clear that models predicting @xmath33 do not reproduce the inverse magnetic catalysis @xcite .",
    "after all , the large fluctuation effects , that is expected to be necessary for the inverse magnetic catalysis phenomenon , are not well activated with such a large mass gap .",
    "note also that the fluctuation arguments alone do not explain why the chiral condensate depends on @xmath2 linearly .    keeping these problems in mind",
    ", we proposed that the quark mass gap can stay around @xmath35 even for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "if this is true , we have @xmath36 so that @xmath37 . in addition , at larger @xmath2 quark fluctuations are no longer suppressed , but enhanced due to the ir phase space extended by the magnetic fields .",
    "indeed , a perturbative effective potential at a _ fixed _ effective quark mass indicates the reduction of @xmath19 as @xmath2 increases @xcite .",
    "all these features seem consistent with the lattice results .",
    "of course , the question is how to get the mass gap of @xmath35 .",
    "the estimate strongly depends on the nature of the interactions .",
    "as argued in the previous works @xcite , the @xmath2-dependence drops off from the mass gap if the ir contributions of the interactions dominate over the uv contributions .",
    "this observation is consistent with the schwinger - dyson studies in which the ir enhanced force was examined @xcite .",
    "this feature is presumably very specific to non - abelian gauge theories , not present in typical effective models .",
    "one of the weakness in our arguments was that the quark self - energies are generally gauge - dependent quantities , and sometimes our intuition does not work well for such objects .",
    "for example , the quark self - energies can be ir divergent in coulomb gauge type confining models @xcite .",
    "these artifacts disappear at the level of color - singlet objects for which artificial contributions cancel each other , leaving only physical quantities .",
    "thus in this paper we will try to deduce ( or define ) the constituent quark mass out of the hadron spectra ; in fact this is how the concept of the constituent quark mass has been developed in traditional arguments .",
    "this observation motivates us to study mesons in strong magnetic fields - meson condensates ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) is omitted from the very beginning by our setup . ] . in the present context",
    ", a sketchy argument was already presented in ref.@xcite , while in this paper we will give a more elaborate account of meson properties .",
    "we focus on mesons of light flavors with quantum numbers allowing a quark and an anti - quark to stay at the lll .",
    "other mesons that inevitably contain higher lls at any time slice have the energy of @xmath38 and will not be discussed . in this selection ,",
    "neutral mesons as well as charged mesons come into our game , and they are as light as @xmath35 .",
    "studies of neutral mesons require treatments beyond those by purely hadronic models , since at large @xmath2 magnetic fluxes penetrate hadrons and couple to quarks inside .",
    "this causes the structural change in neutral mesons @xcite .",
    "for the lattice studies , see refs.@xcite . as an example , in fig.[fig : meson_intro ] we show a schematic picture of a meson state to be discussed in this paper ( see sec.[sec : bseq ] for the outline ) .",
    "we will study mesons at finite transverse momenta for construction of the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model at finite @xmath2 .",
    "the weak field regime was studied in the purely hadronic description in refs .",
    "@xcite , while our concern in this paper is the strong field regime which requires considerations at the quark level .",
    "our approach has some overlap in philosophy with those in refs .",
    "@xcite , although the details are different .",
    "we will find that the transverse momentum dependence in the meson spectrum is sensitive to the nature of the interactions .",
    "in particular , if the ir component dominates , the energy cost associated with the transverse momenta is suppressed by @xmath39 for neutral mesons and @xmath40 for charged mesons , and thereby the meson energy grows very slowly as a function of the transverse momentum .",
    "this allows many meson states to stay at low energy . at finite temperature",
    ", the hrg pressure grows with an increasing @xmath2 , approaching the percolation or chiral restoration regimes at lower @xmath41 compared to the @xmath42 case .",
    "this would offer a _ gauge invariant _",
    "description for the inverse magnetic catalysis .    for all these purposes ,",
    "we analyze the structures of the schwinger - dyson and bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "most of parametric estimates will be given assuming the long - range interactions , such as linear rising or harmonic oscillator potentials .",
    "the use of them provides illuminating predictions dramatically different from models of short - range interactions .",
    "we will address why such difference emerges .",
    "our analyses for the quark self - energy and bound state spectra are essentially based on the large @xmath43 approximation in which the back reaction from the quark sector to the gluon sector can be ignored .",
    "for example , the magnetic field induced quark screening effects for long - range forces , such as the reduction of the string tension observed in the lattice qcd @xcite , will not be manifestly taken into account . but",
    "those effects enhance the inverse magnetic catalysis behavior and are in line with our original proposal . in this paper we will show that even without these back reaction effects one can address a plausible mechanism to explain the inverse magnetic catalysis .",
    "this paper is intended for the first part of a series of papers . in this paper",
    "we try to address generic aspects of meson problems , leaving more quantitative and model - dependent estimates for the second paper .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : preparation ] , we introduce the ritus bases for fermions , and discuss the @xmath2-dependent form factor and schwinger phase which arise from the quark - gluon vertices .",
    "we argue why the lll and higher lls tend to decouple at large @xmath2 in asymptotic free theories . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sdeq ] , we analyze general structures of the schwinger - dyson equation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bseq ] we proceed to analyses on the structure of the bethe - salpeter equations for neutral and charged mesons .",
    "more specific aspects are elaborated in secs .",
    "[ sec : neutral ] and [ sec : charged ] for neutral and charged mesons , respectively . in sec.[sec : hrg ] , we discuss the meson resonance gas , using the knowledges deduced in the previous sections .",
    "sec.[sec : summary ] is devoted to summary and outlook . in [ sec : app ] , we discuss some operator relations which are useful to classify the meson states made of quarks in the lll .",
    "in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath2 , our tree level langrangian reads @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a quark field with the flavor index @xmath46 and the current quark mass @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is a @xmath49 external gauge field .",
    "we use the euclidean signature @xmath50 so that we do not have to distinguish @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53-matrices are defined as hermitian matrices , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "below we use notations , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and the counterparts for momenta , assuming that a uniform magnetic field is applied in the @xmath8-direction .",
    "we choose the landau gauge @xmath58 , and will find that this choice simplifies an issue of gauge dependence in the schwinger - dyson equation . for later convenience , we also introduce the short - hand notations , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the sign function .",
    "there are three steps to construct the ritus bases .",
    "( i ) the first step is to project out the spin of charged fermions as the energy levels in a magnetic field are subject to the zeeman effect .",
    "this can be done by using the spin - projection operators @xmath62 as @xmath63 it is important to remember that @xmath64 commutes with @xmath65 , while anti - commute with @xmath66 which flips the spin .",
    "( ii ) secondly , noting that momenta @xmath67 and @xmath68 are conserved in the landau gauge , we can expand fermion fields as @xmath69 where the index @xmath70 labels an orbital level in the transverse motion .",
    "@xmath71 is the normalized harmonic oscillator function . in this work",
    ", we will use the explicit form at @xmath72 which is given by @xmath73 \\,.\\ ] ] note that the principal quantum number @xmath6 appearing in the energy level ( [ eq : energy ] ) is the sum of the orbital level index @xmath70 and the zeeman splitting @xmath74 with the @xmath75-factor ( @xmath76 ) , i.e. , @xmath77 ; the energy levels are two - fold degenerated except for the unique ground state @xmath11 .",
    "( iii ) therefore , the last step is to relabel the fermion fields since the orbital level indices are not conserved numbers even at the tree level .",
    "we set @xmath78 for the lll , and @xmath79 for the higher lls ( hlls ) .",
    "we also define @xmath80 , which will be useful to have a concise expression of the action below .",
    "then the zero - th order quark action for a flavor @xmath46 can be written as a sum of the landau levels as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 for the lll , and @xmath83 for the hlls with @xmath84 .",
    "note that the @xmath2-dependence drops off from the tree - level lagrangian for the lll , as emphasized in introduction .",
    "while the ritus bases diagonalize the tree - level lagrangian , interactions induces transitions between different lls at the quark - gluon vertices .",
    "in particular the @xmath2-dependence of the lll appears only through the interactions . using the expansion ( [ eq : expand ] ) by the ritus basis",
    ", the vertex of a @xmath46-flavored quark reads @xmath85 where @xmath86 is color matrices normalized as @xmath87 = \\delta_{ab}/2 $ ] , and @xmath88 is a gluon field accompanying the coupling constant @xmath89 .",
    "we find in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vertex ] ) that the integral is factorized because the ritus bases do not manifestly depend on @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the last integral factor works as an overlap function among the plane - wave basis for a gluon and the ritus bases for two quarks . performing the integral ,",
    "this factor can be written in a product form @xmath92 the phase factor @xmath93 is called the schwinger phase , and its explicit form is given by @xmath94 which depends upon @xmath95 , that is , the average of fermion momenta before and after the interaction .",
    "this exponent is gauge variant ; the residual symmetry in the landau gauge , @xmath96 preserves magnetic fields but shifts the fermion momenta in the @xmath97-direction .",
    "an advantage in the landau gauge is that the exponent is common to all of the combinations of couplings between different lls .",
    "we will see that the schwinger phase provides physical effects when we calculate many - body states .",
    "the other factor at the vertex depends only on the momentum transfer flowing into the gluon line as @xmath98 we call it the form factor . for the momentum transfer @xmath99 , we find @xmath100 when @xmath101 , these power factors weaken the relevance of interactions in the ir regime , @xmath102 .",
    "thus the @xmath101 processes , in which a quark hops from @xmath70-th to @xmath103-th orbital level , are dominated by the uv interactions .",
    "in asymptotic free theories , these uv interactions are in the weak - coupling regime and can be treated within the perturbation theory . on the other hand , such ir suppressions do not occur for the @xmath104 processes , so that results are sensitive to the ir structure of the interactions .",
    "therefore , one must directly handle the non - perturbative features of gluon propagators and quark - gluon vertices explicitly .      in this work we focus on the lll in the strong field limit . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex ] , the interaction lagrangian is given by @xmath105 note that the @xmath66 component drops off because @xmath106 .",
    "more physically , the @xmath66 vertices flip spins and inevitably couple the lll to hlls , so that it is irrelevant when we consider only the low energy sector .",
    "this observation also suggests that the relevant gauge fields at the low energy are @xmath107 , while @xmath108 s tend to decouple from the low energy dynamics .",
    "the lattice simulations for gluon condensates and string tensions have indeed shown that configurations of @xmath107 are more screened than @xmath108 , and this behavior can be understood from the suppression of the coupling to @xmath108 at the lll @xcite .",
    "a final comment is on the form factor .",
    "one finds its explicit form at the lll as @xmath109 which cuts off the uv contribution when @xmath110 is larger than @xmath111 . in other words ,",
    "the size of @xmath111 determines to what extent the uv sector can participate in the lll dynamics .",
    "there is another important remark : at @xmath112 , the form factor behaves as @xmath113 which means that the @xmath2-dependence can be dropped off from the ir sector .    with these observations ,",
    "now we can see that there are two distinct contributions in the interactions , namely , the magnetic - field _ dependent _ contributions from the uv interactions , and magnetic - field _ independent _ contributions from the ir interactions .",
    "the @xmath2-dependence of the quark self - energies , chiral condensates , meson spectra , and so on , is determined by the competition between the uv and ir contributions , and thus is very sensitive to the fundamental nature of theories one considers .",
    "for instance , if one employs the models involving contact interactions , the uv contributions are strongly enhanced , and then the quark self - energies are very sensitive to the value of @xmath2 . in contrast , theories involving stronger ir interactions show a much weaker @xmath2-dependence .",
    "therefore , in this respect , qcd should be distinguished from the models that do not properly include the dynamics of the gluonic sector .",
    "this section is devoted to general analyses on the schwinger - dyson equations for the self - energy of the lll . for simplicity",
    "we consider the rainbow approximation only as shown in fig . 3 , but we expect that our arguments hold even after this restriction is removed . assuming the strong field limit , we restrict both the external and intermediate quark states to the lll . for @xmath114 , the impact of hll intermediate states to the lll self - energies was found to be small produces a uv divergence .",
    "however , this uv divergence should be nothing but the divergence in the vacuum at @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the divergence can be absorbed into the renormalized current quark mass at @xmath42 , and the remaining hll contributions result in only ( very ) small higher order @xmath2-corrections @xcite . in short ,",
    "the summation of discretized energy levels and the integral of continuum states yield similar results , so details of the hll contributions do not play a major role in the lll self - energies . ] , so we may ignore it @xcite .    the dressed quark propagator for the lll can be written as @xmath115^{-1 } { \\mathcal{p}}_+ = s_0 + s_0 ( -{\\bf \\sigma } ) s_0 + \\cdots \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath116 is the tree propagator of the lll , and for the moment we suppress flavor indices .",
    "the self - energy @xmath117 is decomposed into @xmath118 we have dropped off the @xmath119 component because the @xmath66 structure is forbidden by the projection operators as @xmath106 . denoting the gluon propagator as @xmath120 , the schwinger - dyson equation is then given by @xmath121 ^ 2   \\label{eq : sd } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath122 is the casimir for the fundamental representation .",
    "we will keep the general form of the gluon propagator @xmath123 which includes insertions of gluon self - energies and is convoluted with dressed vertices .",
    "we emphasize that in the self - energy calculations the schwinger phases from two vertices exactly cancel out .",
    "next , we will show that the self - energy is independent of the transverse momenta even after radiative corrections are included . to prove it , we compare the self - energies @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "first we notice that , in contrast to the @xmath42 cases , the propagator depends on @xmath126 only through the self - energy part .",
    "secondly , the integrand other than the propagator part depends only on the difference @xmath127 .",
    "thus , by shifting the integration variable @xmath128 , we find @xmath129   - s[k_l ; { \\bf \\sigma } ( k_l,{\\vec{k}}_\\perp ) ]   \\ , \\right ] \\times   d_{l ' l '' } ( p - k ) \\left [ { \\mathcal{r}}_{00}({\\vec{p}}_\\perp - { \\vec{k}}_\\perp ) \\right]^2   \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this relation must hold for any values of @xmath130 .",
    "an obvious candidate is @xmath131 , which is independent of @xmath132 ; in this case the lhs and rhs both vanish in the above equation .",
    "this is a natural solution as the perturbative calculation also results in the @xmath132-independent self - energy .    with the above solution ,",
    "we may write @xmath133 , and then find that the integral equation ( [ eq : sd ] ) is factorized as follows . the separation between the longitudinal and transverse momentum dependences allows us to define a two - dimensional effective propagator by @xmath134 ^ 2 \\,,\\ ] ] and the dimensionally reduced schwinger - dyson equation in the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions by @xmath135 ( we should remember that the flavor indices for @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 are suppressed . )    in this equation , the only one origin of the @xmath2-dependence is the form factor hidden in the definition of @xmath138 , since the lll propagator does not contain any manifest @xmath2-dependence . therefore our problem to examine the @xmath2-dependence is now reduced to the study of the effective propagator ;",
    "if the effective propagator strongly depends on @xmath2 , the self - energies also do ; if not , we will find the self - energies ( nearly ) independent of @xmath2 , which , as mentioned in introduction , provides the key ingredient of the scenario for the magnetic catalysis and inverse catalysis of the chiral condensate observed by the lattice qcd simulations .",
    "in this section we investigate general structures of the bethe - salpeter equations for bound states composed of the fermions in the lll , and discuss characteristic differences between neutral and charged mesons .",
    "the self - energies discussed in the previous section is supposed to be used as an input to the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "we consider the bethe - salpeter amplitude defined by @xmath139 where @xmath140 are conserved total momenta , and @xmath141 and @xmath142 are momenta carried by a quark and an anti - quark , respectively ( see fig.[fig : bsamp ] ) . especially we will be interested in the equal - time amplitude , which is defined as @xmath143 in which the @xmath144 and @xmath145 hit the meson state at the same time .",
    "using relative and center - of - mass ( com ) coordinates , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively , the coordinate - space expression can be constructed as @xmath148 where @xmath149 is some normalization factor .",
    "( here we included @xmath150 in the definition since the integral still contains @xmath151 which will be combined with the exponential factor . )    from this form of the wavefunction , we can already get some insights on the bound state problem . at a large @xmath2",
    ", the probability distributions in the @xmath91-direction are localized around @xmath152 and @xmath153 with the variances of @xmath154 , reflecting the cyclotron motion of each quark . therefore the relative and com coordinates are roughly given by combinations of the conserved momentum @xmath151 and the expectation value of the relative momentum @xmath155 as @xmath156 to get intuitive pictures for our bound state problem , first we stress that the momenta we are dealing with are the `` canonical '' momenta which are gauge - variant .",
    "after making a gauge choice , this momentum is related to the `` guiding center '' around which particles exhibit the cyclotron motion .",
    "more intuitively appealing quantity is the `` kinetic '' momentum , @xmath157 , which is related to the velocity .",
    "for instance a particle at large @xmath91 has large canonical momentum @xmath158 but also large @xmath159 .",
    "as the sum of them , the kinetic momentum is not large and remains @xmath160 as expected from the cyclotron motion ; a particle with large @xmath161 has neither large velocity nor large lorentz force .    except the quantum aspects related to the vector potential and guiding center ,",
    "the remaining part can be understood within the classical picture .",
    "like the ( classical ) hall effect , a particle ( anti - particle ) drifts in the direction orthogonal to those of magnetic fields and a force acting on it .",
    "the direction of the drift depends on the electric charge .",
    "now let us examine two characteristic examples .",
    "in case of @xmath162 for the neutral mesons [ fig.[fig : hall_drift](left ) ] , we have @xmath163 in this case , the relative momentum is related to the com coordinate .",
    "we find that the neutral meson spectra are degenerated with respect to this momentum since the spectra are independent of the location of the com coordinate in a constant magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "the conserved total momentum @xmath151 manifestly enters the bound state problem because , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rr_n ] ) and fig.[fig : hall_drift ] , it corresponds to the relative distance between a particle and an anti - particle . in the classical picture , the relative distance",
    "is naturally kept fixed since the particle and anti - particle drift in the same direction with the same velocity , as a consequence of @xmath164 .",
    "moreover this also indicates that besides the conserved momentum @xmath151 , there should be another constant of motion that is related to the relative distance in the @xmath97-direction .",
    "indeed such conserved quantity appears in our bethe - salpeter equation as shown below .",
    "another characteristic case is bound states of equal charges @xmath165 ( fig.[fig : hall_drift](right ) ) , which does not exist in the mesonic system ( because of the difference between @xmath166 and @xmath167 ) but can be applied to diquark or dielectron systems . in such cases , @xmath168 should be replaced by @xmath169 , and this procedure is equivalent to taking @xmath170 in the transverse dynamics of the mesonic systems .",
    "then , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : r1 ] ) and ( [ eq : r1 ] ) , we find @xmath171 the spectra again should not depend on the location of @xmath172 , so that the spectra are degenerated with respect to @xmath151 in contrast to the case of neutral mesons discussed above .",
    "on the other hand , the relative distance @xmath173 depends on the non - conserved momentum @xmath174 , leading to nontrivial oscillating modes which couple the motions in the @xmath91- and @xmath97-directions . in the classical picture ,",
    "a particle and anti - particle drift in the opposite direction while keeping their com coordinate in the @xmath91-direction at @xmath175 ; this motion around a fixed point can be interpreted as a rotating mode whose radius becomes large for higher excitations .",
    "below we will provide more precise statements by analyzing the mathematical structure of the bethe - salpeter equation , and will see that the above heuristic arguments indeed capture the essence of the bound state problems .      in the rainbow ladder approximation , the bethe - salpeter equation for a pair of fermions in the lll states is written down as @xmath176   \\gamma_{l ' }   s^{f ' } ( q_l^- )   \\label{eq : bs } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath177 summarizes the schwinger phases ( [ eq : sch ] ) and the form factors ( [ eq : ff ] ) as @xmath178 } \\,.\\ ] ] before examining roles of @xmath177 , let us first note that the @xmath2-dependence enters the lll dynamics only through the factor @xmath177 .",
    "further we find that the exponents of form factors and schwinger phases appear with an inverse factor of @xmath179 as @xmath180 and @xmath181 , respectively .",
    "therefore , if one plays with theories of the enhanced ir interactions , that factor can be set to @xmath182 , and then the spectra are of the order of @xmath183 independently of @xmath2 .",

    "this behavior is in favor of explaining the linear @xmath2-dependence of the chiral condensate , which has been observed in the lattice simulations . with the same mechanism",
    ", it follows that the meson states at low energy are also nearly @xmath2-independent .",
    "moreover , we found interesting @xmath2-dependence of the transverse momenta , which is essential to count the density of states of mesons at low energy . with this @xmath2-dependence of the meson spectra",
    ", it was shown that at low temperature , the pressure of meson gas parametrically grows as @xmath375 as @xmath369 increases .",
    "this behavior was commonly found in contributions of both neutral and charged mesons . in particular , contributions from neutral mesons are drastically different from those at small @xmath369 ; strong magnetic fields can intrude a neutral composite meson , causing a strong structure change and modification of the spectrum .",
    "the percolation and chiral restoration were discussed within the hadron resonance gas picture .",
    "two phenomena are intimately connected by the overlap of thermally excited hadrons ; at larger @xmath2 , such overlap occurs at lower @xmath41 , because of the enhanced phase space due to the magnetic fields .",
    "finally we close our discussions by repeating the importance of the ir gluons , since their impacts on the qcd phenomenology are so distinct from those based on perturbative gluons or short - range interactions .",
    "the examples can be found for qcd at finite density such as the quarkyonic chiral spirals  @xcite , at finite temperature such as the improved equation of state  @xcite and the massless mode which induces positivity violation  @xcite , and also in external magnetic fields such as the quark mass gap which resolves the puzzle posed by the lattice results  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the application of such an approach to heavy - ion phenomenology has shown signatures of a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "all these studies so far have shown significant importance of the role of long - range interactions / confinement effects in various aspects of qcd under extreme conditions , ranging from static to dynamic properties .",
    "it is thus very encouraging to keep exploring along this direction , which will certainly improve our understanding of the qcd phase transition .    in the second part",
    ", we will address more quantitative aspects , using models of various types of interactions .",
    "this work was supported by nsf grants phy09 - 69790 and phy13 - 05891 ( t.k . ) , jsps grants - in - aid no .",

    "[ sec : locking ]    in this paper we consider only the strong field regime where the lll approximation is the proper starting point . in such a regime ,",
    "usual classifications of states , in terms of the angular momentum or isospin , are not as useful as in the @xmath42 case .",
    "on the other hand , we are also interested in how meson states at @xmath42 are connected to those at large @xmath2 .",
    "to observe the relation between these two limiting cases , we investigate how the meson interpolating fields at @xmath42 reduce to the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional fields in the llls .",
    "the good summary of the algebra can be also found in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us begin with the @xmath376-operator , @xmath377 where @xmath378 is the third component of the spin operator , and @xmath379 can be regarded as the two - dimensional @xmath380 which characterizes the moving directions in the @xmath8-direction .",
    "using @xmath381 , we can define the right- and left - movers whose momenta are oriented in the @xmath382 and @xmath383 directions , respectively : @xmath384 we use the indices ( @xmath385 ) to label the moving directions ( or two - dimensional chirality ) , and distinguish them from the four - dimensional chirality ( @xmath386 ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath387 and @xmath388 depends on the spin directions of fields .",
    "we find the relations for spin up and down states , respectively , as @xmath389 for the spin down states , the chiralities in four- and two - dimension appears to be opposite .",
    "now let @xmath390 and consider the lll fields .",
    "the spin - flavor contents are @xmath391 . as in the above",
    ", we find quark moving in the @xmath8-direction , and more @xmath392 quark moving in the @xmath383-direction . ]",
    "@xmath393 when considering @xmath394 , one should flip the direction of spin .",
    "next we map the four - dimensional quark bilinear operators from four to two space - time dimensions . in doing this",
    "we will keep only the lll fields .",
    "the scalar and pseudo - scalar operators which can be made of the lll fields are listed as @xmath395 operators such as a @xmath396 necessarily contain the hll fields , so that such combinations were omitted here .",
    "these expressions imply that the scalar and pseudo - scalar mesons are light when they are neutral , e.g. , @xmath397 , and are as heavy as @xmath398 when they are charged , e.g. , @xmath399 .",
    "note that in the pseudo - scalar channel the sign of the operator flips for @xmath400-quarks . due to this sign flip ,",
    "the isosinglet ( isovector ) operators made of the llls in 4d behave as isovector ( isosinglet ) in 2d .",
    "this observation becomes important when one considers the annihilation of a quark and anti - quark in the llls into purely gluonic configurations , such as instantons .    for vector currents ,",
    "there are two types of operators that couple to low energy states .",
    "the first type is composed of like - charge fields @xmath401 where @xmath65 preserves the spin of fields . for instance , it couples @xmath402 to @xmath403 , or @xmath404 to @xmath405 , etc .",
    "the expression implies that vector mesons with @xmath406 become light when they are neutral , e.g. , @xmath407 and @xmath408 , but becomes heavy when they are charged , e.g. , @xmath409 .",
    "the second type is composed of unlike - charge fields @xmath410 where @xmath66 flips the spin of fields and thereby can couple the lll fields with different flavors . in this respect , @xmath66-matrices may be regarded as `` flavor''-matrices for the lll dynamics .",
    "note also that @xmath411 and @xmath400 in the lll have the opposite two - dimensional chirality , so that @xmath412 and @xmath413 behave as 2d scalar operators , rather than vector ones .",
    "therefore 4d operators producing mesons with @xmath414 states end up with scalar mesons in 2d at large @xmath2 .",
    "the expression implies the spin - charge locked states which are realized in such a way that @xmath415 are light , while @xmath416 , @xmath417 , etc .",
    "are heavy .",
    "next we consider axial - vector currents .",
    "the longitudinal components can be related to the vector currents as @xmath418 therefore the 4d axial - vector and vector currents couple to the same 2d states . since the 4d axial - vector currents also couple to the nambu - goldstone bosons , at large @xmath369",
    "the correlators of axial - vector , vector , and pseudo - scalar show the same low energy behaviors governed by the llls .",
    "the transverse components are @xmath419 which can be regarded as flavor off - diagonal 2d pseudo - scalar operators .    for tensor operators ,",
    "there are three kinds of operators .",
    "the first two operators do not mix up different spin states and can be reduced to ( @xmath420/2 $ ] ) @xmath421 and @xmath422 the third one mixes spins ( or flavors ) , @xmath423 which can be regarded as flavor off - diagonal 2d vector operators .    in summary",
    ", many 4d operators , that couple to different meson states , show the same asymptotic behaviors , and can be reduced to 2d operators . in particular , operators having very different structures in four dimensions can look the same in the language of 2d operators made of the llls .",
    "for instance , we have seen that the axial - vector , vector , and pseudo - scalar operators in 4d couple to the same pseudo - scalar mesons in 2d .",
    "this implies that in strong magnetic fields these correlators at a long distance scale are saturated by the same asymptotic states .",

    "<S> we study properties of neutral and charged mesons in strong magnetic fields @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the qcd renormalization scale . assuming long - range interactions , we examine magnetic - field dependences of various quantities such as the constituent quark mass , chiral condensate , meson spectra , and meson wavefunctions by analyzing the schwinger - dyson and bethe - salpeter equations . based on the density of states obtained from these analyses , we extend the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model to investigate thermodynamics at large @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath2 increases the meson energy behaves as a slowly growing function of the meson s transverse momenta , and thus a large number of meson states is accommodated in the low energy domain ; the density of states at low temperature is proportional to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this extended transverse phase space in the infrared regime significantly enhances the hrg pressure at finite temperature , so that the system reaches the percolation or chiral restoration regime at lower temperature compared to the case without a magnetic field ; this simple picture would offer a gauge invariant and intuitive explanation of the inverse magnetic catalysis . </S>"
