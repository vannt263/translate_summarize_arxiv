    "let us begin with the statement from the preface to the proceedings of the meeting held in 2006 on `` applications of random matrices in physics '' : @xcite _ random matrices are widely and successfully used in physics for almost 60 - 70 years , beginning with the works of wigner and dyson .",
    "initially proposed to describe statistics of levels in complex nuclei , the random matrix theory has grown far beyond nuclear physics , and also far beyond just level statistics .",
    "it is constantly developing into new areas of physics and mathematics , and now constitutes a part of the general culture and curriculum of a theoretical physicist . _ besides applications in all branches of quantum physics , rmt is being used in disciplines such as econophysics , wireless communication , information theory , multivariate statistics , number theory , neural and biological networks and so on .",
    "the focus in this article is on the frontier topic of statistical properties of isolated finite many - particle quantum systems @xcite .",
    "examples for these systems are atoms , atomic nuclei , mesoscopic systems ( quantum dots , small metallic grains ) , interacting spin systems modeling quantum computing core , ultra - cold atoms and so on .",
    "a route to investigate statistical properties is to employ the classical goe or gue or gse random matrix ensembles with various deformations . for these , as wigner states : _ the assumption is that the hamiltonian which governs the behavior of a complicated system is a random real symmetric or complex hermitian or quaternion real matrix , with no special properties except for its symmetric or hermitian or quaternion real nature .",
    "_ however , for most of the isolated finite many - particle quantum systems , their constituents predominantly interact via two - particle interactions and the classical random matrix ensembles are too unspecific to account for this most important feature .",
    "one refinement which retains the basic stochastic approach but allows for this feature consists in the use of embedded random matrix ensembles @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is more appropriate to represent an isolated finite interacting quantum system , say with @xmath1 particles ( fermions or bosons ) in @xmath2 single particle ( sp ) states by random matrix models generated by random @xmath3-body ( note that @xmath5 and most often we have @xmath6 ) interactions and propagate the information in the interaction to many particle spaces .",
    "thus we have random interaction matrix models for @xmath1-particle systems . in the simplest version ,",
    "the @xmath3-particle hamiltonian ( @xmath7 ) of a spinless fermion ( or boson ) system is represented by goe / gue / gse and then the @xmath1 particle @xmath7 matrix is generated using the @xmath1-particle hilbert space geometry .",
    "the key element here is the recognition that the @xmath4 lie algebra transports the information in the two - particle spaces to many - particle spaces . as a goe / gue / gse random matrix ensemble in two - particle spaces is embedded in the @xmath1-particle @xmath7 matrix , these ensembles are generically called embedded ensembles ( ee ) . with gue embedding",
    "we have egue and in this paper egue is used throughout . for ee ,",
    "a general formulation for deriving analytical results is to use the wigner - racah algebra of the embedding lie algebra @xcite .",
    "the focus in the present paper is on transition strengths and they are not yet studied in any detail using ee @xcite .",
    "also , as emphasized in @xcite , there are many open questions in the random matrix theory for transition strengths in finite interacting quantum many - particle systems .    for finite quantum many - particle systems , induced by a transition operator",
    ", a given system makes transitions from its states to the states of the same system or to the states of another system .",
    "examples are electromagnetic transitions ( then the initial and final systems are same ) , nuclear beta and double beta decay ( then the initial and final systems are different ) , particle addition to or removal from a given system and so on . given a state with energy @xmath8 and say it is connected to a state @xmath9 by a transition operator @xmath10 , then the transition strengths are @xmath11 and these will determine for example the life time of a state .",
    "it is important to recognize that the transition strengths probe the structure of the eigenfunctions of a quantum many - body system and thus they are very important from the point of view of experiments probing the structure of a system .",
    "also , they are needed in many applications ( for example , beta decay transition strengths are essential for nucleosynthesis studies ) . in the statistical theories ,",
    "it is more useful to deal with the corresponding transition strength density ( this will take into account degeneracies in the eigenvalues ) defined by i_(e_i , e_f ) = i(e_f)|e_f e_i|^2i(e_i ) .",
    "[ strn - eq1 ] in eq .",
    "( [ strn - eq1 ] ) , @xmath12 are state densities normalized to the dimension of the @xmath1 particle spaces .",
    "note that @xmath8 and @xmath9 belong to the same @xmath1 particle system or different systems depending on the nature of @xmath10 , the transition operator .",
    "working towards developing a complete statistical theory for transition strength densities ( transition strengths multiplied by the density of states at the initial and final energies ) for isolated finite many - particle quantum systems , we have started a program to derive formulas for the lower order bivariate moments of the strength densities generated by a variety of transition operators .",
    "in general , the hamiltonian may have many symmetries with the fermions ( or bosons ) carrying other degrees of freedom such as spin , orbital angular momentum , isospin and so on .",
    "also we may have in the system different types of fermions ( or bosons ) and for example in atomic nuclei we have protons and neutrons .",
    "in addition , a transition operator may preserve particle number and other quantum numbers or it may change them . among all these various situations , in our program",
    "we have considered five different systems : ( i ) a system of @xmath1 spinless fermions and a transition operator that preserves the particle number ; ( ii ) a system of @xmath1 spinless fermions and a transition operator that removes say @xmath0 number of particles from the @xmath1 fermion system ; ( iii ) same as ( ii ) but for particles addition operator ; ( iv ) a system with two types of spinless fermions with the transition operator changing @xmath0 number of particles of one type to @xmath0 number of other particles as in nuclear beta and double beta decay ; ( v ) same as ( i)-(iii ) but for spinless boson systems . in @xcite , results are presented for ( i ) . in the present paper results",
    "are presented for ( ii ) and their extensions to ( iii ) and ( iv ) are briefly discussed ; ref .",
    "@xcite gives results from a first study for ( iv ) .",
    "let us add that ( ii ) and ( iii ) are important for example in nuclear physics as one and two particle removal and addition to a nucleus are important experimental probes of the structure of the atomic nucleus ; see for example @xcite .",
    "thus , the results in sections 3 - 5 have applications in nuclear physics .",
    "now we will give a preview .",
    "section 2 gives some basic results for egue(@xmath3 ) for spinless fermion systems as derived in @xcite .",
    "using these results , formulas for the lower order bivariate moments of the transition strength densities for the situation ( ii ) above are derived and they are presented in detail in section 3 . using these ,",
    "results in the asymptotic limit are derived and they are presented in section 4 .",
    "extension of the results in section 3 to the situations ( iii ) and ( iv ) above are briefly discussed in section 5",
    ". finally , in section 6 gives conclusions and future outlook .",
    "let us consider @xmath1 spinless fermions in @xmath2 degenerate sp states with the hamiltonian @xmath13 a @xmath3-body operator , = _ i , j v_ij(k)a^_i(k)a_j(k),v_ij(k ) = k , i k , j .",

    "[ strn - eq3 ] here the over - line indicates ensemble average . from now on we will drop the hat over @xmath7 and denote when needed @xmath7 by @xmath22 . in physical systems in general @xmath6 but in some systems such as atomic nuclei and bec",

    "used here is the @xmath4 tensorial decomposition of the @xmath22 operator giving @xmath26 irreducible parts @xmath27 and then , h(k ) = ^k_=0 ; _ w _ , _ ( k ) b^ , _ ( k ) .",
