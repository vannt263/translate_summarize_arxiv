    "in a number of domains such as medical applications , atmospheric sciences , microbiology , environmental science , and reliability theory among others , data are positive , right - skewed , with their highest values decaying exponentially . among the most suitable models used by researchers and practitioners to deal with this kind of data are usually parametric distributions as the log - normal , gamma and weibull distributions . however , known distributions are not always enough to reach a good fit to the data .",
    "this has motivated the interest in the development of more flexible and better adapted distributions , which have been generated using different strategies such as the combination of known distributions @xcite , introduction of new parameters in given distributions @xcite , transformation of known distributions @xcite , and junction of two distributions by splicing @xcite .    in this paper , a new procedure to develop new distributions",
    "is proposed .",
    "the aim is to guarantee that a probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath2 defined for @xmath3 , for some @xmath4 , exponentially decays to 0 as @xmath5 and as @xmath6 .",
    "an advantage of this condition is that this itself still holds if any polynomial @xmath7 with @xmath8 is included as a factor in such pdf . in this way",
    ", the new distribution would have great flexibility in neighborhoods of 0 and @xmath9 by controlling @xmath10 , thus capturing a wide variety of shapes and tail behaviors .",
    "we refer to this new distribution as the generalized exponential log - squared distribution ( gel - s ) .",
    "the above - mentioned features for pdfs are also satisfied by the log - normal and related distributions .",
    "further , the log - normal distribution may be considered a particular case of gel - s , however , as will be seen later , the latter does not generalize the log - normal distribution .",
    "the aim of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , to study statistical properties of the gel - s distribution and methods for estimating its parameters .",
    "second , to provide empirical evidence on the great flexibility of the gel - s distribution to fit real light - tailed and right - skewed data from different domains . for numerical assessments ,",
    "the implementation of this model is done using functions in the r software @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "the pdf associated to the new three - parameter distribution is introduced by considering the condition on pdfs indicated above , and explicit expressions of its cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) and survival function ( sf ) are provided in some cases .",
    "further , closeness of the new distribution with well - known distributions is discussed .",
    "section [ sec2 ] presents statistical properties of the new distribution .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the maximum likelihood method for estimating the parameters of the new distribution . in section [ sec4 ]",
    ", the performance of the parameter estimation method is studied using simulations .",
    "section [ sec5 ] shows applications of the new distributions to real data sets coming from different domains .",
    "section [ sec6 ] concludes the paper presenting discussions and conclusions and next further steps .",
    "proofs are presented in the annexe .",
    "in this section , the gel - s distribution is introduced .",
    "the pdf of the new cdf is defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the normalizing constant .",
    "this function holds exponential decays at its tails : writing @xmath13 and noting that , if @xmath14 , @xmath15 or if @xmath16 , @xmath17 and , by applying the lhpital rule , @xmath18 then we have , for any @xmath8 , @xmath19 further , this means that both tails of this function are light @xcite , which implies that @xmath20 reaches 0 very fast when @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "due to difficulties in the manipulation of @xmath20 for any @xmath8 , for instance for computing integrals of this function , this study was limited to cases when @xmath10 takes non - negative integer values .",
    "therefore , in this paper , the definition of the pdf will be considered as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the normalizing constant .",
    "the deduction of @xmath12 is presented in annexe [ proofs ] .",
    "the cdf is then , for @xmath3 , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the cdf of a standard normal random variable ( rv ) .",
    "the deduction of @xmath25 is presented in annexe [ proofs ] . from ( [ deff ] ) the sf @xmath26 associated to @xmath25",
    "may be deduced by using its definition @xmath27 , but following similar computations as in the deduction of @xmath25 and using the property @xmath28 , the following expression for @xmath26 is obtained , for @xmath3 : @xmath29    relating @xmath20 with the pdf of a log - normal distribution with parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 , writing @xmath32 gives that the former distribution becomes the latter one if @xmath14 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "hence , the log - normal distribution is a particular case of the gel - s distribution , implying that the gel - s distribution might thus inherit the importance that the log - normal distribution has taken to model data @xcite .",
    "however , the new distribution is not an extension of the log - normal distribution since the latter is built when considering the rv @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a rv following a normal distribution , but the introduction of @xmath37 in @xmath38 gives an expression that is not related to any expression based on normal rvs .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for further details on the log - normal distribution and its generalizations .    as discussed above ,",
    "the gel - s distribution is close to the log - normal distribution .",
    "other pdfs that are close to the new pdf in terms of their structures are presented in table [ tab01 ] , where the new pdf is included in order to appreciate similarities and differences among them . through these pdfs two main functions multiplying each other",
    "are identified : one that is based on the exponential function and a second function formed by the remaining part . according to the functions based on the exponential function , the gel - s , two - parameter log - normal and three - parameter log - normal distributions are very similar to each other , whereas on the second functions the gel - s and gamma distributions are close to each other .",
    ".distributions that are close to the gel - s distribution [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ figfatigue ] presents a histogram with 55 bins of the fatigue data used and the overlay of the fitted gel - s model reached .",
    "in this paper , a new right - skewed three - parameter distribution , with support @xmath0 for some @xmath1 and with pdf showing exponential decays at its both tails , was introduced .",
    "we called this distribution the generalized exponential log - squared ( gel - s ) distribution .",
    "the proposed original distribution had the limitation that one of its parameters @xmath39 was not easily tractable as a continuous parameter , but it was tractable when it took the values 0 , 1 , 2 ,  .",
    "this led to a reformulation of the proposed distribution by limiting @xmath39 to take non - negative integers .",
    "we proved that the gel - s distribution is close to well - known distributions such as the two - parameter and three - parameter log - normal and gamma distributions , but the new one does not generalizes any of these distributions .",
    "statistical properties of the gel - s distribution were analyzed .",
    "closed forms for the @xmath40th moment and for statistics as the mean , variance , skewness , and kurtosis were provided . also , the mode and quantile function were studied . the maximum likelihood method ( mle ) for estimating the parameters of the distribution gel - s was proposed , but it can not be applied using derivatives since one of its parameters is not continuous .",
    "this led to the formulation of a strategy that still applies derivatives which consisted in fixing k and thereafter , computing derivatives with respect to the other parameters .",
    "simulations conducted to assess the performance of the above - strategy for estimating parameters were performed , finding that for small samples that were not enough right - skewed , the true parameters could not be recovered . despite this last issue",
    ", applications performed on four well - known real light - tailed and right - skewed data sets related to different domains showed that the new distribution outperformed other competitors .",
    "thus , the new distribution seems to be a promising model for representing light - tailed and right - skewed data .",
