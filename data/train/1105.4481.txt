    "most stars form in clusters @xcite . therefore , understanding the formation process of star clusters is a key step towards a full understanding of how stars form .",
    "recent observations have revealed that star clusters form in turbulent , magnetized , parsec - scale dense clumps of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "these clumps contain masses of @xmath9 , fragmenting into an assembly of cores that collapse to produce stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ". in cluster - forming clumps , stellar feedback such as protostellar outflows , stellar winds , and radiation rapidly start to shape the surroundings . because of the short separations between forming stars and cores ,",

    "* ) . however , the roles of the stellar feedback on cluster formation remain poorly understood observationally .    according to recent theoretical studies , two main scenarios of cluster formation are now under debate . for these two scenarios ,",
    "the roles of the stellar feedback on cluster formation are different .",
    "one is the rapid , dynamical formation model , in which the large - scale turbulent flow mainly controls star formation in cluster - forming clumps , and star formation is envisioned to complete in a short time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", cluster formation is expected to be terminated by stellar feedback due to initial star burst within a couple of turbulence - crossing times , so that star formation efficiencies ( sfes ) can stay low at a observed level in nearby cluster - forming regions ( sfe @xmath10 0.1 ) . to promote rapid gravitational collapse and thus rapid star formation ,",
    "the magnetic fields should be weak dynamically .",
    "another scenario is the quasi - virial equilibrium model , in which cluster formation is considered to continue at least for several dynamical , or free - fall , times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because supersonic turbulence dissipates rapidly in a turbulence - crossing time",
    ", additional turbulent motions should be injected to maintain the supersonic turbulence .",
    "protostellar outflow feedback is proposed to play a significant role in the turbulence regeneration @xcite .",
    "the moderately - strong magnetic fields are also important to impede the rapid global gravitational collapse . in this case",
    ", the global inflow and outflow are expected to coexist , interacting with themselves . as a result",
    ", the cluster - forming clumps as a whole can keep quasi - equilibrium states for a relatively long time .    in an effort to discriminate between the two scenarios and constrain the theory of cluster formation ,",
    "we have made a start on a systematic observational study of a nearby infrared dark cloud ( irdc ) , serpens south , with a focus on the stellar feedback .",
    "recent observations strongly suggest that irdcs are in the very early phase of star cluster formation @xcite and presumably still retain the primordial structure of the cluster s natal cloud . in particular , in the early phase of evolution , the protostellar outflows are likely to play a more dominant role in cloud dynamics , compared to the stellar winds and radiation , because they are more powerful in the early protostellar evolution @xcite .",
    "therefore , irdcs are expected to be suitable to explore the roles of protostellar outflows on cluster formation .",
    "serpens south is a nearby embedded cluster , recently discovered by @xcite using the spitzer space telescope .",
    "the accurate distance to serpens south remains unknown .",
    "most of the previous studies adopt the same distance as the serpens cloud core , located about 3@xmath11 north , because the ysos associated with serpens south have the same lsr velocities as the serpens cloud core , whose distance is usually adopted as 260 @xmath12 37 pc @xcite .",
    "however , larger distances of 415@xmath13 pc , 380 pc , and 360@xmath14 pc have been recently claimed for the serpens cloud core based on a vlba parallax of ec95 , a young aebe star embedded in serpens cloud core @xcite , seds of ysos base on the near infrared observations @xcite , and x - ray luminosity functions @xcite , respectively . according to @xcite , the serpens south",
    "cloud appears to be seen in absorption against pah emission from the w40 hii region .",
    "therefore , the distance to w40 is likely to be an upper limit to the distance to serpens south , although even the former has not yet been determined to any satisfactory precision ( 300 pc @xmath15 900 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper , we assume 260 pc as the distance to serpens south .    from the spitzer irac observations",
    ", @xcite revealed that the cluster contains about 60 class i protostars and 40 class ii sources .",
    "recently , @xcite have discovered 7 class 0 candidates in this region through the herschel gould belt survey ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the central part of the cluster , the fraction of class i protostars relative to all the ysos ( class i / ii ) reaches about 80 % at the high surface density of 430 pc@xmath8 .",
    "these observations indicate that serpens south is undoubtfully in the very early stage of cluster formation , i.e. , serpens south is a `` protocluster '' that are forming a number of stars .",
    "@xcite also estimated the median projected distance between nearest neighbor ysos to be about 3700 au , significantly shorter than the typical length of protostellar outflow lobes , implying that the outflows can potentially influence star formation in this region .",
    "recent dust continuum observations have revealed that the cluster is located at the constricted region in a long filamentary cloud that is recognized as a dark cloud in mid - infrared ( @xmath16 m ) wavelength @xcite .",
    "several sub - filaments also appear to converge toward the main filament ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "very recently , @xcite carried out near - infrared ( jhks ) polarization observations toward serpens south using the imaging polarimeter sirpol which is a polarimetry mode of the near - infrared camera sirius mounted on the irsf 1.4 m telescope at the south africa astronomical observatory .",
    "they found that the global magnetic field is spatially well - ordered and almost perpendicular to the main filament .",
    "several sub - filaments appear to be parallel to the global magnetic field .",
    "these observational facts imply that moderately - strong magnetic field played a role in the course of the formation of the serpens south filament .",
    "the moderately - strong magnetic field appears consistent with the quasi - virial equilibrium model where the magnetic fields significantly impede the global gravitational collapse ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "first , we describe the details of our co @xmath17 and hco@xmath1 @xmath18 observations toward serpens south in section [ sec : observations ] .",
    "we present in section [ sec : results ] our co @xmath17 and hco@xmath1 @xmath18 maps toward serpens south , which reveal a number of powerful collimated outflows and clumpy structure in the central part of the protocluster , respectively .",
    "we also compare our co @xmath17 map with the three - color spitzer irac image ( 3.6 @xmath19 m in blue , 4.5 @xmath19 m in green , 8.0 @xmath19 m in red ) to help identify the molecular outflow lobes . in the three - color image ,",
    "the knots created by shocks due to the outflows are found as extended green objects with excess in 4.5 @xmath19 m emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we derive the global properties of the outflows identified from our co @xmath17 map .",
    "then , in section [ sec : discussion ] , we briefly discuss how the observed outflows influence the clump dynamics .",

    "we make the image , by combining scans along the two axes that run at right angles to one another using the plait algorithm developed by emerson & graeve ( 1988 ) , in order to minimize the `` scanning effect '' .",
    "the observation region was extended to a larger @xmath24 box ( box 2 in fig .",

    "the main - beam efficiency , @xmath26 , was 0.57 at 345 ghz .",
    "we used a 345 ghz sis heterodyne receiver , which had the typical system noise temperature of about 200 k in dsb mode at the observed elevation .",
    "the temperature scale was determined by the chopper - wheel method , which provides us with the antenna temperature , @xmath27 , corrected for the atmospheric attenuation . as a backend",
    ", we used four sets of 1024 channel autocorrelators , providing us with a frequency resolution of 125 khz that corresponds to 0.11 km s@xmath6 at 345 ghz . after subtracting linear baselines ,",
    "the data were convolved with a gaussian - tapered bessel function ( magnum et al .",
    "2007 ) and were resampled onto a @xmath28 grid .",
    "the resultant effective fwhm resolution is @xmath29 .",
    "the typical rms noise levels are 0.11 k and 0.51 k in @xmath30 with a velocity resolution of 0.5 km s@xmath6 for box 1 and box 2 and 3 , respectively .    as for the spitzer irac data ,",
    "archival data in three irac bands ( 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8.0 @xmath19 m ) were obtained for serpens south .",
    "all the data had been reduced with the basic calibration data ( bcd ) pipelines developed by infrared processing and analysis center ( ipac ) , and mosaicked with the mosaicking and point source extraction ( mopex ) software developed by spitzer science center .",
    "the mean fwhms of the point response functions ( prfs ) are 1@xmath23.66 , 1@xmath23.72 , 1@xmath23.98 , for the three bands , respectively ( see spitzer space telescope observer s manual version 8.0 ) .",
    "since both the co ( @xmath0 ) and hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) transitions have higher critical densities ( approximately , @xmath31 and 10@xmath32 @xmath33 , respectively ) and higher transition energies ( @xmath34 and 43 k , respectively ) than those of the lower transition lines such as co ( @xmath35 ) , it allows us to examine higher density and/or higher temperature gas . in figure",
    "[ fig : copeak ] , we present the co ( @xmath0 ) velocity integrated intensity map in the ranges from @xmath36 km s@xmath6 to + 15 km s@xmath6 , which shows that the co ( @xmath0 ) emission tends to be much stronger in the southern box with about @xmath37 area ( boxes 1 and 2 ) , while a relatively weak emission can be seen in the northern box with about @xmath38 area ( box 3 ) .",
    "in fact , the serpens south protocluster resides in box 1 , and the strong co ( @xmath0 ) emission originates mainly from the powerful molecular outflows of the cluster member ysos , as described in the next subsection .",
    "we note that the weak co ( @xmath0 ) emission was detected in the entire observed area , indicating that the molecular gas is widely distributed in much larger area .",
    "we also present in figures [ fig : peaksmall]a , [ fig : peaksmall]b , and [ fig : peaksmall]c , the co ( @xmath0 ) peak intensity , hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) peak intensity , and 1.1 mm continuum maps , respectively , toward box 2 .",
    "the 1.1 mm continuum map was taken by the aztec camera @xcite on the aste 10 m telescope @xcite .",
    "the positions of class i and ii sources identified by @xcite from the spitzer irac observations are plotted in figures [ fig : peaksmall]a through [ fig : peaksmall]c .",
    "the 1.1 mm map indicates that the dense gas is distributed along a long filament running from north to south .",
    "this filament ( hereafter , the main filament ) has several sub - filaments that appear to converge toward the main filament .",

    "the co ( @xmath0 ) spectra often show double - peak line profiles , whereas the hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) spectra often show single - peak line profiles . by comparing the co ( @xmath0 ) and hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) spectra ,",
    "it is clear that the co ( @xmath0 ) line profiles appear to be caused by self - absorption in the range from @xmath39 to @xmath3 10 km s@xmath6 , rather than multiple velocity components .",
    "strong co ( @xmath0 ) and hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) emission come from almost the same part where the 1.1 mm emission is strongest and the serpens south protocluster is located .",
    "in fact , the co ( @xmath0 ) and hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) emission peaks coincide reasonably well with the 1.1 mm peak .",

    "[ fig : profile3 ] suggests that the clump contains several subfragments .",

    "[ fig : hcochannelmap ] .",
    "as shown in the next subsection , these two subfragments contain the possible driving sources of the outflows .",

    "the positions of these two subfragments coincide reasonably well with those of the 3 mm compact sources recently identified by the nma observations ( fukuda et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the co line profiles have prominent blueshifted and/or redshifted wings near the region where the co emission is strongest , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile1 ] .",
    "the line wings sometimes extend over the velocity range of @xmath41 30 km s@xmath6 .",
    "these prominent wings indicate the presence of powerful molecular outflows in this region . the co ( @xmath0 ) peak intensity map indicates that there are several local peaks and ridges near the central dense part of the protocluster . as shown in section [ subsec : outflow ] , these peaks trace the outflow lobes reasonably well .",
    "similar high - velocity wings can also been seen in the hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) line profiles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : profile3 ] ) that are are sometimes extended in the range from about 3 km s@xmath6 to 15 km s@xmath6 around the subfragments located near the 1.1 mm peak .    in the southern part of box 2 ,",
    "the redshifted components of the identified outflows tend to be extremely weak ( see also the line profiles presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile1]b ) .",
    "it is unclear what causes the extremely - asymmetric line profiles in the southern area .",
    "one possibility is the existence of a foreground cloud in the velocity of around 10 km s@xmath6 in the southern area . the foreground cloud , if cold , preferentially absorbs the redshifted outflow components .",
    "another possibility is the existence of the global infall toward the southern part of the cloud .",
    "if the cloud envelope is infalling , the foreground infall gas having velocities similar to the redshifted outflow components can absorb the redshifted components . in the next subsection",
    ", we identify the molecular outflow lobes from co ( @xmath0 ) data and discuss several features of the outflow lobes in detail .      here , using the co ( @xmath0 ) data cubes , we attempt to identify high - velocity components that originate from molecular outflows .",
    "first , we scrutinize the velocity channel maps ( figs .",
    "[ fig : channelmap ] and [ fig : channelmap2 ] ) and the position - velocity diagrams ( see e.g. , fig . [",

    "thus , identifying outflows from the @xmath42co emission alone is extremely difficult in this crowded area .",
    "therefore , we compare the co image with three - color spitzer irac images ( 3.6 @xmath19 m in blue , 4.5 @xmath19 m in green , 8.0 @xmath19 m in red ) of this region , which are presented in figure [ fig : spitzer ] .",

    ", we refer to such objects as infrared h - h objects .",
    "to identify the infrared h - h objects , we first made an image of the remaining emission in the spitzer irac band 2 ( 4.5 @xmath19 m ) image after the subtraction of the emission in band 1 ( 3.6 @xmath19 m ) .",
    "this image processing in practice allows us to discriminate between shocks and stars , displaying them with positive and negative values , respectively @xcite .",
    "we then visually inspected the image to search for mid - infrared outflows .",

    "[ fig : bluered2 ] the blueshifted and redshifted high - velocity components identified from hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) . in the following , we describe some of the main features of the high - velocity components we identified from the co ( @xmath0 ) data .",
    "the relatively strong blueshifted components b1 and b4 are well localized in the channel maps and appear at the maps within the wide range of 0.75 km s@xmath6 to 5.75 km s@xmath6 .",
    "these lobes have extremely high - velocity blueshifted components .",
    "in particular , the b1 component has moderately - strong emission even in the velocity range of about @xmath1510 km s@xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : profile1 ] ) .",
    "there are also many infrared h - h objects associated with these two components .",
    "the b1 and b4 appear to move away from the central dense part toward north and south , respectively .",
    "in fact , the most distant infrared h - h object associated with b4 has a bow shape , consistent with the interpretation that it is moving away from the dense part ( see fig . [",
    "fig : spitzer2]b ) . as mentioned below",
    ", the b4 component might originate from a compact 3 mm source located at the 1.1 mm peak , recently identified by the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) observations ( fukuda et al . in prep . ) .",
    "if this is the case , the corresponding redshifted components are likely to be r2 and r3 .",
    "the position of the 1.1 mm peak is indicated by a diamond ( source 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spitzer2]b ) in the spitzer image .",
    "it appears that no clear spitzer sources are associated with the 1.1 mm peak .",
    "the 3 mm source discovered by the nma observations may be a deeply - embedded , extremely - young protostar such as a class 0 source .",
    "in fact , the hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) line profile toward source 2 shows blue - shifted part that are stronger than the red - shifted part ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : blueskewed ] ) .",
    "such a blue - skewed profile of an optically - thick line may be indicative of infalling gas , suggesting that the 3 mm source located at the 1.1 mm peak is an infalling object having a powerful outflow .",
    "there are two faint blueshifted components labeled with b2 and b3 .",
    "they are vaguely seen in the channel maps with high velocities ( 0.75 km s@xmath6 @xmath3 1.75 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "some infrared h - h objects appear to be associated with the b3 component ( see fig . [",
    "fig : spitzer2 ] ) .",
    "the position - velocity diagram indicates that the blueshifted component b8 is likely to be the outflow component that appears to move away toward south .",
    "the blueshifted components b14 and b7 are located near the edge of box 1 .",
    "although b7 appears to move from north west to south east from its morphology , the driving source remains unknown .",
    "there is no redshifted counterpart associated with b7 .",
    "the b7 component is also associated with some extended green objects suggesting that the ambient gas is shocked by the b7 component ( see fig .",

    "the b14 component also do not have a redshifted counterpart .",
    "there is a compact dust continuum source immediately south of b14 , where @xcite found two protostar candidates by the herschel observations .",
    "the spitzer image also shows two compact sources at the same places as the dust continuum source and the herschel protostar candidates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spitzer3 ] ) .",
    "we suggest that the northern source is likely to be the driving source of b14 .",
    "this interpretation appears to be supported by the fact that the 1.1 mm emission is weak at the position of the b14 component , apparently breaking the main filament into two parts ( see fig . [",
    "fig : bluered3]a ) , and bending the northern part of the filament toward south .",
    "there are some infrared h - h objects in the southern part of b14",
    ". these objects may originate from b14 .",
    "the relatively - faint blueshifted component b6 is clearly seen in the channel maps in the range of 3 km s@xmath6 to 5 km s@xmath6 , apparently moving toward the south - west direction .",
    "the possible driving source is one of the class i sources identified by @xcite ( source 3 in fig .",

    "the b6 component appears to point toward the relatively - strong blueshifted component b9 .",
    "however , it is unclear whether b9 originates from the outflow lobe .",
    "the peak of b9 is about 0.4 pc away from the 1.1 mm peak .",
    "the position - velocity diagram may imply that this component has different lsr velocity ( @xmath43 km s@xmath6 ) from the central dense part and does not show the velocity structure typical of the outflow lobe ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pvmap]b ) . however , there are no ysos associated with the same area as the b9 component .",
    "therefore , this component might be a fossil of the outflow lobe or infalling gas toward the central dense part along a sub - filament .",
    "further investigation is needed to clarify the origin of this component .",
    "there is a redshifted component r1 between the two blueshifted components b1 and b2 .",
    "this redshifted component is clearly seen in the peak intensity map and appears to move away from the dense part .",
    "this component appears to be associated with a blueshifted component , which can be seen in the velocity channel maps with 4.75 km s@xmath6 and 5.75 km s@xmath6 .",

    "several infrared h - h objects are associated with these components .",
    "interestingly , at the area between r2 and r3 , the 1.1 mm emission shows a double - peak feature and the 1.1 mm emission tends to be weak on the line connecting between r2 and r3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bluered3]b ) .",
    "in addition , there is an area having relatively strong 1.1 mm emission just at the north of r2 .",
    "this morphology leads us to the following possibility : the redshifted lobes r2 and r3 come from the same source and r2 went through the dense part , reaching and hitting the dense part located at the north .",
    "the r3 component appears to coincide with the high - velocity component identified by the hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) map ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bluered2 ] ) .",
    "such high - velocity dense gas may suggest that the outflow is very young . as mentioned above , the possible driving source is a 3 mm source recently discovered by the nma observations , whose position almost coincides with the 1.1 mm peak ( source 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spitzer2 ] , fukuda et al . in prep . ) .",
    "however , other unknown sources might be the real driving sources of these outflow lobes because this central part is very dense and crowded .",

    "the possible driving source is one of the class i objects identified by @xcite ( source 4 in fig .",

    "5 of @xcite . in the northern box with about @xmath38 area ( box 3 ) we found three molecular outflows ,",
    "all of which show clear bipolar features : b10 and r5 , b11 and r6 , and b12 and r7 .",
    "since this region is out of our spitzer image , we can not identify the driving sources .    in box 2",
    ", we identified four additional high - velocity components labeled by b13 and r9 .",
    "these components possibly originate from some outflows .",
    "however , further observations would be needed to clearly identify the outflow lobes .",
    "we note that the directions of the outflow lobes often appear to be roughly along the global magnetic field direction that is running almost perpendicularly to the main filament @xcite , e.g. , b2 , b5 , b6 , b9 , b15 , b16 , r4 , r8 , and r10 .",
    "however , several components , e.g. , b1 , b3 , b4 , r2 , and r3 , appear to be independent of the global magnetic field direction .",
    "this indicates that the central dense part is magnetically supercritical and therefore , the local supersonic turbulence have presumably perturbed the magnetic field significantly . in fact , the recent numerical simulations of cluster formation indicate that even the moderately - strong magnetic field causes a significant misalignment between the global field direction and the outflow propagation directions because of the strong turbulence @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : bluered ] shows that the high - velocity components are crowded in the central dense part where the protocluster resides and therefore it is very difficult to clearly discriminate the individual outflow lobes from the data .",
    "therefore , we postpone to accurately evaluate the physical properties of the individual outflows until high spatial resolution data taken by interferometric observations become available . in the following ,",
    "we calculate some global physical properties of the outflowing gas located at the cluster center . on the other hand ,",
    "five bipolar outflows mentioned in the previous subsection can be easily identified in the co ( @xmath0 ) map , because they are found in relative isolation .",
    "however , we postpone to calculate the individual outflow parameters of these bipolar outflows because the rms noise level is relatively high with a significant scanning effect , precluding accurate estimation of the outflow parameters .",
    "examination of the spectra in the cloud shows that ambient @xmath42co spectra away from the outflows appear to cover a velocity range of 6 to 11 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we thus assume that the emission in this velocity range include ambient emission for the entire cloud .",
    "therefore , the integration ranges used are @xmath45 to 4 km s@xmath6 for the blue - shifted emission and 11 to 30 km s@xmath6 for the red - shifted emission , respectively .",
    "the outflow masses were calculated under the assumption of lte , a distance of 260 pc , and optically - thin emission in the line wings with an excitation temperature of 30k .",
    "we note that the physical quantities estimated below are insensitive to the excitation temperature .",
    "the estimated quantities increase only by 20 % over the range of @xmath46 k.    following @xcite , the outflow mass @xmath47 , the outflow momentum @xmath48 , and kinetic energy @xmath49 are estimated as @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively , where @xmath53 is the mass of the @xmath54-th channel , @xmath55 is the lsr velocity of the @xmath54-th channel and @xmath56 is the systemic velocity of the driving source . here",

    "we adopt @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 is the solid angle of the object and @xmath69 is the distance to the object . from these quantities , we calculate the characteristic velocity as @xmath70",
    ".    table [ tab : outflow ] summarizes the outflow parameters derived from the co ( @xmath0 ) data .",
    "the physical quantities presented in table [ tab : outflow ] depend on the adopted velocity interval for the integration .",
    "for example , if we change the velocity intervals as @xmath45 to 6 km",
    "s@xmath6 ( @xmath45 to 2 km s@xmath6 ) for the blue - shifted emission and 9 to 30 km s@xmath6 ( 13 to 30 km s@xmath6 ) for the red - shifted emission , the total mass , momentum , and energy change by + 65% ( @xmath1550% ) , 20% ( @xmath1530% ) , and 5 % ( @xmath1513 % ) , respectively .",
    "this indicates that the total momentum and energy do not depend strongly on the adopted velocity intervals , although the total mass does .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the outflow components with lower velocities have lower momenta and kinetic energies . as mentioned above",
    ", the distance to serpens south remains uncertain . if we adopt @xmath71 pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , instead of 260 pc , then the mass , momentum , and energy increase further by a factor of 2.5 . therefore , a main uncertainty on the estimation of the outflow parameters comes from the adopted distance to the cloud , rather than the adopted velocity intervals .",
    "the hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) line emission has a critical density of @xmath72 @xmath33 , and thus traces the dense molecular gas . here , we estimate the mass and radius of the central dense clump , using the hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) data ( see fig . [",
    "fig : profile3]a ) .",
    "the mass of the hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is evaluated from @xmath73 m_\\odot   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the above expression , the mass and radius of the central clump are estimated to be about 80 @xmath5 and 0.1 pc , respectively , where we assumed lte and the excitation temperature of 14 k @xcite .",
    "the mean density is estimated to be @xmath74 @xmath33 .",
    "the estimated mean density is smaller than the critical density of the hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) line by an order of magnitude .",
    "this may suggest that the central clump contains multiple small subfragments that are not spatially - resolved in our observation .",
    "in fact , recent numerical simulations of cluster formation suggest that the central dense region of a cluster forming clump consists of multiple thin filaments that tend to fragment into denser blobs by the destruction due to the outflow feedback @xcite . however , it is difficult to verify such a clumpy structure only from our observations .",
    "higher spatial resolution observations will be needed to reveal the density structure of the dense clump .",
    "the fractional abundance of hco@xmath1 relative to h@xmath65 is assumed to be @xmath75 , which is adopted from @xcite .",
    "we note that the fractional abundance of the hco@xmath1 remains uncertain toward serpens south .",
    "however , from the 1.1 mm data , the 1.1 mm mass in the same area as that of the hco@xmath1 clump is evaluated to be @xmath76 @xmath5 , which is not far from the mass estimated from the hco@xmath1 emission .",
    "therefore , the adopted hco@xmath1 abundance is likely to be reasonable .",
    "the fwhm one - dimensional velocity width of hco@xmath1 is estimated to be @xmath77 km s@xmath6 near the cluster center .",
    "the estimated velocity width corresponds to the mach number of about 5 .",
    "according to recent theoretical studies , two main scenarios for cluster formation are proposed .",
    "one is the rapid , dynamical formation model , in which the large - scale flow mainly controls the formation of cluster - forming clumps .",
    "star formation is considered to complete rapidly within a few crossing times before initial turbulence decays significantly @xcite . in this model , the magnetic field",
    "is expected to be dynamically weak to promote rapid global gravitational collapse . to terminate cluster formation",
    ", this model envisions the stellar feedback by the initial star burst that disperses the dense gas away from the parent clumps , and eventually the clumps are destroyed .",
    "the second scenario is the quasi - equilibrium model . in this model , star formation process",
    "is considered to be slow and continue at least for several dynamical times @xcite . because supersonic turbulence dissipates quickly in a turbulence - crossing time @xcite",
    ", additional turbulent motions should be injected to maintain the supersonic turbulence . in cluster - forming clumps ,",
    "protostellar outflow feedback is considered to be a plausible way of driving a significant fraction of supersonic turbulence @xcite .",
    "the protostellar outflow - driven turbulence can maintain the clump close to a quasi - virial equilibrium at least for several dynamical times @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is expected to be dynamically important to impede rapid global gravitational collapse .",
    "very recently , @xcite found that the global magnetic fields associated with the serpens south filament are well ordered , implying that the moderately - strong magnetic field played an important role in the formation of the filament .",
    "the magnetic structure is likely to be consistent with the quasi - equilibrium model .    to further constrain these cluster formation models ,",
    "it is thus important to clarify the dynamical state of the clump and the energy budget of the current outflows in this region , because these two cluster formation models predict the very different star formation duration timescales . in the following ,",
    "we attempt to estimate the injection rate of the turbulent energy due to the outflows and the dynamical state of the dense clump .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the total energy injection rate ( mechanical luminosity ) due to the protostellar outflows and energy dissipation rate of supersonic turbulence in the dense clump . from fig .",
    "[ fig : bluered ] , the mean length of the outflow lobes can be estimated to be 0.1 - 0.2 pc , and the mean velocity along the line - of - sight direction is about 7 km s@xmath6 ( see table [ tab : outflow ] ) . from these values , the mean dynamical time of the outflows , @xmath78 , can be evaluated as @xmath79 years , assuming @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the total energy injection rate due to the outflows is obtained as @xmath80 on the other hand , the energy dissipation rate of supersonic turbulence is estimated to @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the nondimensional coefficient , @xmath83 is the one - dimensional ( 1d ) fwhm velocity width corrected for the contribution of the thermal pressure assuming the temperature of 14 k ( see equation [ 3 ] of @xcite ) , and @xmath84 is the driving scale of supersonic turbulence . from the hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 )",
    "data , we can derive the energy dissipation rate as @xmath85 where we adopted the velocity width and the driving scale @xmath84 as @xmath86 km s@xmath6 and the clump diameter of @xmath87 pc , respectively .",
    "both the energy injection rate @xmath88 and energy dissipation rate @xmath89 are proportional to the distance to the cloud , @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the relative importance between @xmath88 and @xmath89 is irrespective of the distance uncertainty . the energy injection rate due to the outflows is somewhat larger than the energy dissipation rate .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the outflow feedback can contribute significantly to the generation of supersonic turbulence in the clump .",
    "since we identified about 5 pairs of the outflows in the densest part , the mean outflow momentum for a single outflow may be estimated to be about 2 m@xmath4 km s@xmath6 .",
    "if we assume the median stellar mass of 0.5 m@xmath4 , then this gives the outflow momentum per unit stellar mass of about 4 km s@xmath6 , corresponding to the non - dimensional parameter @xmath90 of about 0.04 ( see also maury et al .",
    "2009 for the case of ngc2264-c ) , which gauges the strength of a outflow , where the wind velocity of 100 km s@xmath6 is adopted .",
    "this value is somewhat smaller than the fiducial values adopted by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ". the estimated value may be somewhat underestimated because the outflow lobes are assumed to be optically - thin .",
    "if the effect of the optical depth is taken into account , the value of @xmath90 is presumably larger than the estimated value by a factor of a few .",
    "even for a small value of @xmath91 , @xcite demonstrated that the outflow feedback can supply sufficient momentum to dynamically support a parsec - scale cluster - forming clump for several free - fall times , by means of the 3d mhd turbulent simulations .",
    "we note that if the distance to serpens south is as large as about 900 pc , the upper limit of the distance to w40 @xcite , the outflow strength @xmath90 is estimated to be @xmath92 .      in the following ,",
    "we investigate the dynamical state of the serpens south clump , by applying the virial analysis .",
    "the virial equation for a sphere is given by @xmath93 where the terms , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , denote the moment of inertia , internal kinetic energy , and gravitational energy , respectively . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the surface pressure term .",

    "here , we adopt @xmath102 for simplicity , which means no magnetic support . the value @xmath103 is a dimensionless parameter of order unity which measures the effects of a nonuniform or nonspherical mass distribution @xcite . for a uniform sphere and a centrally - condensed sphere with @xmath104 , @xmath105 and 1 , respectively . for the hco@xmath1 clump ,",
    "the effects of the nonspherical mass distribution appear to be small because the aspect ratios are not so far from unity ( see also figure 2 of bertoldi & mckee 1992 ) . here",
    ", we adopt @xmath106 because the clump seems centrally - condensed .    then , the terms @xmath95 and @xmath96 are estimated to be @xmath107 m@xmath4 km@xmath7 s@xmath8 and @xmath108 m@xmath4 km@xmath7 s@xmath8 , respectively , which yields the virial ratio , the ratio between @xmath109 and @xmath96 , of 0.8 @xmath15 1.1 .",
    "this value increases by a factor of about 1.3 , if we adopt the magnetic field strength derived by @xcite . the dense clump as",
    "a whole is close to quasi - virial equilibrium . on the other hand ,",
    "the outflow kinetic energy of the central dense part detected in the co ( @xmath0 ) emission is derived as @xmath110 m@xmath4 km@xmath7 s@xmath8 , corresponding to about 7 % the global gravitational energy , where we adopted the value corrected for the inclination angle @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the energy input due to the current outflows may not contribute to change the global kinetic energy significantly .",
    "in other words , the current outflow activity observed in serpens south appears not to be enough to disperse the whole cluster - forming clump ( see also maury et al .",
    "2009 for the case of ngc2264-c ) .",
    "we note that the terms @xmath95 and @xmath96 increase with @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively , and therefore the virial ratio decreases by a factor of 1.6 if we adopt @xmath71 pc , instead of 260 pc .",
    "since this factor and the factor due to the magnetic support almost cancel each other out , the dense clump is likely to be close to the virial equilibrium .",
    "the presence of class ii ysos in this region suggests that star formation has lasted over @xmath113 years , assuming the typical class ii timescale of about @xmath113 yr .",
    "however , the low fraction of class ii relative to class i sources implies that the ages of the ysos in this region may be younger than those in other nearby cluster - forming regions @xcite .",
    "the age of this region may be @xmath114 yr .",
    "this corresponds to a few @xmath3 20 free - fall times of the clump assuming the mean density of @xmath115 cm @xmath116 , where @xmath117 according to @xcite , about 30 class i and ii stars are associated with the area where we detected the strong hco@xmath1 emission . assuming the median stellar mass of 0.5 m@xmath4 , the star formation efficiency in the dense part is derived as about 15 @xmath15 20 % , as reasonably high as those of other nearby cluster - forming clumps .",
    "this corresponds to about 1 @xmath15 5 % of the star formation rate per free - fall time .",
    "this value is in good agreement with that estimated by @xcite .",
    "since the current outflow activity does not provide enough kinetic energy to destroy the clump , subsequent star formation is expected to continue .",

    "most of these outflow components appear to move away from the dense part . in the northern part",

    "most of the outflow components tend to be anti - correlated with the dense gas traced by the 1.1 mm continuum emission .",

    "a couple of strong redshifted outflow components appear to interact with the dense gas .",
    "\\3 . the central dense clump detected by the hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) emission has a mass of 80 @xmath5 and a radius of about 0.1 pc , with an axis ratio of about 2 .",

    "the dense clump has very clumpy structures .",
    "some of the subfragments appear to coincide with the positions of the class 0 candidates identified by @xcite .",
    "we estimated the global physical quantities of the outflows .",

    "<S> we present the results of co ( @xmath0 ) and hco@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) mapping observations toward a nearby embedded cluster , serpens south , using the aste 10 m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> our co ( @xmath0 ) map reveals that many outflows are crowded in the dense cluster - forming clump that can be recognized as a hco@xmath1 clump with a size of @xmath3 0.2 pc and mass of @xmath3 80 m@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the clump contains several subfragments with sizes of @xmath3 0.05 pc . by comparing the co ( @xmath0 ) map with the 1.1 mm dust continuum image taken by aztec on aste </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the spatial extents of the outflow lobes are sometimes anti - correlated with the distribution of the dense gas and some of the outflow lobes apparently collide with the dense gas . the total outflow mass , momentum , and energy are estimated at 0.6 @xmath5 , 8 @xmath5 km s@xmath6 , and 64 @xmath5 km@xmath7 s@xmath8 , respectively </S>",
    "<S> . the energy injection rate due to the outflows is comparable to the turbulence dissipation rate in the clump , implying that the protostellar outflows can maintain the supersonic turbulence in this region . </S>",
    "<S> the total outflow energy seems only about 10 percent the clump gravitational energy . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the current outflow activity is not enough to destroy the whole cluster - forming clump , and therefore star formation is likely to continue for several or many local dynamical times . </S>"
