    "in a recent study of the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) toward a region of anomalous microwave emission , iglesias - groth et al . ( 2008 ) have shown evidence for the presence of the naphthalene cation , @xmath10 , the simplest policyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) , in the line of sight towards the moderately reddened star cernis  52 ( bd+31@xmath11 640 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , cernis 1993 ) .",
    "the pahs , including the naphthalene cation , have been also detected in a cometary dust sample returned to earth by stardust and in interplanetary dust particles , possibly of cometary origin ( see the review by li 2009 ) .",
    "cernis  52 is an early type star , classified as a3v by cernis ( 1993 ) , has coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( j2000.0 ) , and is located at an angular separation of less than one degree from the very young stellar cluster ic  348 in the perseus ob2 molecular complex .",
    "the photometric distance to star cernis  52 is 240 pc ( cernis 1993 ) , consistent with a location in the molecular complex ob2 where the microwave emitting cloud is also most likely located ( see watson et al .",
    "the uncertainties prevent to conclude whether the star is embedded in a cloud of this young star forming region or lay behind .",
    "iglesias - groth et al .",
    "( 2008 ) claimed that the relative strength of several diffuse interstellar bands detected in the spectrum of cernis  52 was consistent with the presence of a molecular cloud in the line of sight . the anomalous microwave emission detected in the direction to perseus ( watson et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) could be associated to electric dipole radiation of fast spinning hydrogenated carbon - based molecules in a molecular cloud , a mechanism originally proposed by draine and lazarian ( 1998 ) .",
    "it is important to establish whether the cloud responsible for the excess color of cernis  52 hosts the carriers of both , the diffuse interstellar bands observed in the spectrum of this star and the anomalous microwave emission detected in its line of sight .",

    "we present a precise determination of the stellar parameters and a detailed chemical composition study of the star cernis 52 .",
    "this abundance analysis should provide indications of the likely li abundance for the star , i.e. , if the star is not chemically peculiar should have a lithium abundance no greater than the cosmic li abundance of a(li)+12$]]@xmath16 in this paper we will discuss with special attention the naphthalene cation s feature at 6707.4   in the spectrum of cernis  52 and investigate the relationship of this star with the perseus star forming region .",
    "we have made use of spectroscopic data obtained with the 2dcoud cross - dispersed echelle ( cs23 , tull et al .",
    "1995 ) at the 2.7 m harlan j. smith telescope at mcdonald observatory ( texas , usa ) .",
    "we observed the star cernis  52 on 26 , 27 august 2007 , and 1 , 2 march 2008 in the spectral range @xmath17 , with resolving power @xmath18 and  @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "these two datasets were independently reduced and properly combined to produce final spectra of snr  @xmath20150 and 250 , respectively , at the position of h@xmath21 for a dispersion of 0.05 / pixel .",
    "we also performed spectroscopic observations with the cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph sarg ( gratton et al .",
    "2001 ) at the telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( la palma , canary islands , spain ) .",
    "we observed the target star on 4 november 2006 in the spectral ranges @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with a spectral resolution of @xmath24 and a final snr  @xmath25 at h@xmath21 for a dispersion of 0.034 / pixel .",
    "early - type rapidly rotating hot stars were also observed for correction of possible telluric absorptions in all campaigns .",
    "all the spectra were reduced within iraf , wavelength calibrated and co - added after correction for telluric lines .",
    "firstly , each of the three final spectra was cross - correlated ( within the package molly ) with a synthetic spectrum properly broadened with a @xmath26  .",
    "thus , we corrected these spectra for their radial velocities and derived a rotational velocity of @xmath9  by comparing broadened and veiled versions of a a3v synthetic spectrum in steps of 5  , adopting an spherical rotational profile with linearized limb - darkening @xmath27 , appropriate to the spectral type of the star ( al - naimiy 1978 ) .",
    "finally , we estimate a radial velocity of cernis  52 at @xmath28  .",
    "the cross - correlation was performed in the spectral range @xmath29   and masking the broad h@xmath21 profile and the interstellar features at 5889 - 95   and 6280   .",
    "this determination is consistent with the mean radial velocity of the young cluster ic  348 , which has been recently estimated at @xmath30  from 30 near solar - mass cluster members ( dahm 2008 ) .",
    "however , nordhagen et al . ( 2006 ) derived a mean cluster velocity of @xmath31  , also from 30 cluster members .",
    "we also determine a radial velocity of @xmath32  from the narrow atomic interstellar lines  d 5889 - 95   , 6708   and 7698   .",
    "the uncertainty on the velocity comes from the dispersion of these velocity measurements .",
    "these determinations share the velocity of the most luminous cluster member hd281159 ( @xmath33  , evans 1967 ) and an expanding supernova shell in which the young cluster ic  348 is embedded ( @xmath34  , snow et al .",
    "in addition , these atomic interstellar lines have a velocity consistent with that of the interstellar hyperfine transitions of the molecule @xmath35 measured in radio wavelegths ( rosolowsky et al .",

    "using the camera fastcam ( oscoz et al . 2008 ) attached to the nordic optical telescope ( not ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos , we obtained images in @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 bands of cernis  52 on 25 october 2008 .",

    "the slit length was @xmath49 in both campaigns .",
    "since the slit width was quite large and the seeing during the observations was typically @xmath50 , most of the light from the companion star must have entered in the slit and contaminated the spectrum of cernis  52 . assuming that the primary is a3v and that both stars are a physical pair we can estimate the spectral type of the companion from the observed magnitude difference in the r - band .",
    "we adopt a @xmath51@xmath52  k and @xmath53@xmath54 for the primary .",
    "thus , we find a probable @xmath51@xmath55  k for the companion from suitable bolometric corrections ( bessell et al .",
    "1998 ) and assuming that both stars share the same color excess .",
    "thus , we search for evidence of the spectrum of a solar - type companion in the 2007 and 2008 final spectra of cernis  52 .",
    "we cross - correlated these spectra with the spectrum of the sun ( kurucz et al .",
    "1984 ) , properly broadened with different rotational velocities and in a radial velocity range from -150 to 150 , but we did not find any clear signature of this star in the cross - correlation function .",
    "it is likely that the companion star have slightly contaminated the spectrum of cernis  52 . from the magnitude difference in the @xmath39 band and taking into account that",
    "the companion star was partially out from the slit , we estimate the flux ratio of both stars in our spectrum at @xmath56 in the wavelength region corresponding to the @xmath39 band .",
    "however , as we will see this is not sufficient to explain the level of veiling found in the analysis of the photospheric features of cernis  52 .",
    "there must be another reason for the apparent weakness of the stellar features .    in fig .",
    "[ c52dss2r ] we display an optical image from the palomar digital sky survey of cernis  52 with a field size of @xmath57 . in this dss-2 red image",
    "one can see an entended emission of interstellar gas surrounding the star which may be the reason why the spectrum of cernis  52 is veiled .",
    "our spectra were not background subtracted , since the star is very bright and the raw images do not show any clear sky line . however , in the raw images there is neither any indication of the presence of this nebulosity , appart from the high number of counts of the sky , and any signal must have been subtracted when correcting for the scattered light . in fig .",
    "[ c52dss2r ] we see that the interstellar cloud is more prominent towards the north of the star , @xmath58 from the star center .",
    "however , we do not see any asymmetry in the signal of the sky spectrum which may indicate that the slit was not positioned south@xmath59north .",
    "the interstellar cloud may have contaminated our spectra but we suspect that most of the light coming from the cloud must have been subtracted during the data reduction . a discussion of the interstellar emission in the proximity of cernis  52 , using spitzer data , is deferred to a forthcoming paper ( s. iglesias - groth et al .",

    "the position of the star is in between the theoretical tracks with masses 2.2 and 1.8 .",
    "these masses and the derived @xmath90imply a radius in the range @xmath181 .",
    "the young cluster ic  348 has an age of 37  myr , according to trullols & jordi ( 1997 ) , from a sample of 123 stars in a wide range of spectral types .",

    "they used photometric data of a large sample of k7-m8 spectral - type stars , although they also obtained spectroscopic data .",
    "herbig ( 1998 ) also studied the age of roughly 100 stars of this cluster and found a spread between 0.7 and 12 myr .",
    "all these studies depend on spectral - type classifications which may be uncertain , however , they seem to support that the age of ic  348 likely range between 1 and 12  myr .",

    "we know the photometric magnitudes in five different filters : @xmath182 ( from cernis 1993 ) , @xmath183 and @xmath184 mag , and @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 mag from the 2mass catalog . except for the 2mass magnitudes",
    ", we adopted _ ad hoc _ the values for the uncertainties on the photometric magnitudes of cernis  52 .",
    "we derived the radius of the star from the surface gravity , @xmath2@xmath188 dex , and assuming a mass of 2   .",
    "this radius , together with the spectroscopic estimate of the effective temperature , @xmath74@xmath189  k , provides an intrinsic bolometric luminosity in the range @xmath190 .",
    "we determined the absolute bolometric magnitude from the following formula : @xmath191 , where the solar bolometric magnitude is @xmath192 ( iau simposium 1999 ) and the solar luminosity is @xmath193  erg  s@xmath69 .",
    "the apparent bolometric magnitude , @xmath194 , was derived using the bolometric corrections , @xmath195 , for non - overshooting atlas  9 models ( bessell , castelli , & plez 1998 ) . the bolometric corrections were determined as @xmath196 . for the 2mass infrared magnitudes we computed the theoretical colors @xmath197 , for @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 , from gonzlez hernndez & bonifacio ( 2009 ) .",
    "we adopt the color excess , @xmath13 mag , from cernis ( 1993 ) which seems to provide consistent distances when using optical and infrared magnitudes .",
    "we compute the magnitude corrected for extinction in each filter as @xmath201 , where @xmath202 were obtained using the relation @xmath203 , with @xmath204 , the ratio of total to selective extinction , given by the coefficients provided in mccall ( 2004 ) .",
    "this author gives @xmath205 with deviations unlikely to exceed 0.05 .",
    "note that using a different value , e.g. @xmath206 as derived for cernis  77 ( bd+31@xmath11 643 ) in snow et al .",
    "( 1994 ) or @xmath207 as in cernis ( 1993 ) , lead to small corrections to the distance determination , by 21 and 12  pc respectively .",
    "the apparent magnitude , @xmath208 , was decontaminated from the magnitude of the companion star , according to the stellar parameters derived in section  [ seccont ] .",
    "we estimate the flux ratio of both stars , @xmath209 , from theoretical magnitudes which were interpolated in the grid of theoretical colors @xmath210 and @xmath211 ( bessel et al . 1998 ) and the color @xmath212 and magnitudes @xmath213 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 ( gonzlez hernndez & bonifacio 2009 ) .",
    "finally , the corrected magnitude is derived from the following expression    @xmath214    where @xmath208 is the corrected magnitude in the filter @xmath215 , @xmath216 is the observed magnitud which contains the flux of both stars , and @xmath217 , the flux ratio @xmath209 in the filter @xmath215 . in table",
    "[ tbldist ] we show the derived distance for each filter with different sets of the relevant parameters .",
    "note that the relatively small formal error in the distance estimate for each filter is calculated by assuming the magnitudes equal @xmath218 .    .",

    "the filled circle represents the position of cernis  52 .",
    "the triangles and squares following the tracks represent the position of the theoretical stars at the age of 3 and 9 myr respectively . ]",
    "we have derived a distance of 231@xmath7  pc for the star cernis  52 , according to the adopted stellar parameters and mass in section  [ seciron ] and  [ discage ] .",
    "cernis ( 1993 ) argued that the star cernis  52 is a member of the young cluster ic  348 .",
    "this author derived a distance to cernis  52 of 236  pc from the @xmath38 magnitude , adopting a spectral type of a3v and a color excess @xmath13 .",
    "he also derived a distance to the cluster ic  348 of @xmath219  pc from 13 probable members of the cluster .",
    "trullols & jordi ( 1997 ) provide a photometric determination of the distance to ic  348 based on the filter @xmath38 of @xmath220  pc from 43 cluster members .",
    "these distance determinations rely on spectral type classification .",
    "herbig ( 1998 ) argued that spectral types derived from spectroscopy would produce types somewhat later , and thus smaller @xmath221 , and concluded that the trullols & jordi ( 1997 ) photometric distance should correspond to a spectroscopic distance of 276  pc .",
    "our distance determination to cernis  52 seems to be in agreement with that of the young cluster ic  348 .    to sum up , all the arguments provided in this paper support cernis  52 as being a member of the young cluster ic  348 , and place the star far enough to explain the large color excess , and the presence of the interstellar features recently discovered by iglesias - groth et al .",
    "these intestellar features must be caused by the known dark clouds already mentioned by cernis ( 1993 ) , in particular , the dark cloud l1470 which covers all the young cluster ic  348 .",
    "the triplet 61568   required a high o abundance ( [ o / h]@xmath222 ) , whereas the best fit abundance of the triplet 77715   is [ o / h]@xmath223 ( see fig .  [ figo ] ) .",
    "this is unexpected since the triplet at 77715   shows stronger negative nlte corrections than the triplet 61568   ( baschek et al .",
    "this may indicate the existence of some veiling at 7773   , instead of the zero value adopted ( according to the extrapolation of the veiling previously derived as a function of wavelength ) .",
    "similar problems are found in the b triplet 516783   ( see fig .  [ figmg ] ) .",
    "for these features we depict the synthetic spectra computed using the best fit abundance given by the feature 5173   , and this abundance is unable to reproduce both mg features at 5167 and 5183   .",
    "there are other features over the whole spectrum that can not be reproduced with the synthetic stellar spectra which may be related to the presence of unknown dibs .",
    "we emphasize that for the chemical abundance analysis we have chosen only those features that are not affected by any known interstellar absorption band .",
    "the photospheric abundances of the star seems to be almost solar within the error bars , i.e. , the star does not belong to the group of chemically peculiar ( cp ) a - type stars .",
    "there appears to be a correlation between the presence of chemical anomalies and the rotational velocity of these stars ( e.g. fossati et al .",
    "2008 ; takeda et al .",
    "thus , stars with @xmath224  are underabundant in o and ca ( down to [ x / h]@xmath225 ) , and overabundant in fe ( [ fe / h]@xmath226 ) and specially ba ( up to [ ba / h]@xmath227 ) , whereas si and s shows near - solar abundances .",
    "cernis  52 has a rotational velocity on the edge between `` peculiar '' and `` normal '' a stars . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ figba ] , we depict the ba line which gives an abundance [ ba / h]@xmath228 , which is even lower than the solar abundance .",

    "upper panel : synthetic spectra are computed with a(li)@xmath54 ( solid line ) and a(li)@xmath229 ( dashed line ) .",
    "we emphasize that a(li)@xmath229 must be the maximum li abundance in this star ( see section  [ disnaph ] ) .",

    "we also display the combined spectrum ( dashed line ) including the spectrum of cernis  52 contributing with 90% of the stellar flux and the spectrum of the companion star contributing at 10% , respectively .",
    "the dashed line shows a synthetic spectrum with a(li)@xmath229 and 4.0 , for cernis  52 and the companion , respectively .",
    ", width=283 ]      in our paper announcing the discovery of the naphthalene cation ( iglesias - groth et al . 2008 ) , we noted that the strongest band of the interstellar cation appeared at 6707.4  , i.e. very close to the stellar resonance line . the abundance analysis presented in this paper",
    "was expected to provide indications of the likely li abundance for the star , i.e. , a star without abundance anomalies is very likely to have a lithium abundance no greater than the local abundance of a(li)@xmath232 ( see bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ figsi ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ figli ] we show three synthetic spectra : ( i ) two of them computed only considering the star cernis  52 and with a already too high li abundance , a(li)@xmath54 and a cosmic li abundance , a(li)@xmath229 , and , ( ii ) the other combining the spectrum of cernis  52 with a(li)@xmath229 and the spectrum of the companion star with a(li)@xmath54 , contributing with 90 and 10% , respectively , to the stellar flux .",
    "we estimated the rotational velocity ( see section  [ secrot ] ) at @xmath233  from many stellar lines in the spectral range @xmath99 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ figsi ] and more clearly in fig .",
    "[ figli ] , the stellar lithium line at 6707.8  is unable to fill the whole feature even if we increase the li abundance up to a(li)@xmath54 . in the second case ,",
    "we choose a rotational velocity for the companion star of 100  to reproduce this broad feature , but even using a very high li abundance , a(li)@xmath54 , is not enough to completely fill this broad feature .",
    "the required li abundance able to fit this feature , a(li)@xmath234 , is extraordinarily high .",
    "again a(li)@xmath229 is a highly probably maximum for the companion at @xmath74@xmath55k .",
    "we must emphasize that even with this large rotational velocity and abnormally high li abundance for the companion star , the feature is still not perfectly reproduced by the synthetic spectrum .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ figba ] , we depict the subordinate line at 6103.4   .",
    "the subordinate li line is very weak and the feature at 6103   is dominated by a line at 6102.2   and a line at 6103.5   .",
    "thus , increasing the li abundance from a(li)@xmath229 to a(li)@xmath54 has a negligible effect on the line profile .",
    "thus , we can not estimate the li abundance from this subordinate li line .",
    "polosukhina & shavrina ( 2007 ) suggested that the li abundance obtained in cp stars with magnetic fields from the li subordinate line may be higher than that derived from the resonance li line by 0.20.4 dex .",
    "this may suggest vertical stratification of li .",
    "in addition , cp stars shows enhanced li abudances up to a(li)@xmath54 .    in section  [ discabu ]",
    "we discarded the possibility that cernis  52 is a cp star , so its li abundance must be at the most the cosmic li abundance , i.e. a(li)@xmath229 .",
    "therefore , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figli ] , the stellar li line should only be responsible for a small fraction of the equivalent width of the broad feature at 6707.4   .",
    "all the above statements confirm that this broad feature must have a insterstellar origin and most probably linked to the naphthalene molecule .",
    "the other broad feature at 6756   ( see fig",
    ".  [ figsi ] ) is probably another interstellar feature ( s. iglesias - groth et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "finally , another detection of pahs in the interstellar medium has been recently discovered by iglesias - groth et al .",
    "these authors report a pah band at @xmath235   , the anthracene cation , @xmath236 .",
    "we have performed a detailed chemical analysis of the star cernis  52 .",
    "we apply a technique that provides a determination of the stellar parameters , taking into account any possible source of veiling .",
    "we find @xmath107 k , @xmath237 , @xmath4 } = -0.01 \\pm 0.15 $ ] , and a veiling ( defined as @xmath238 ) of less than 55% at 5000  and decreasing toward longer wavelengths .",
    "the spectrum of cernis  52 shows many features very likely related with the interstellar medium .",
    "in addition , we discover in photometric images a companion 1.7  mag fainter star at a distance of @xmath239 , but this star only contributes with 10% of the stellar flux in our spectra and hardly affect the stellar features of cernis  52 .",
    "the derived chemical abundances are roughly solar within their error bars .",
    "this prevent the star from being a chemically peculiar star .",
    "we have compared the stellar parameters with pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks of solar metallicity and see that the star is consistent with being a pre - main - sequence a - type star with an age of @xmath180  myr .",
    "we have estimated the distance to cernis  52 using the available johnson - cousins and 2mass photometric data , at 231@xmath7  pc according to the stellar parameters and its error bars .",
    "this value also agrees with the distance to the cluster ic  348 .",
    "we confirm that the feature at 6707.4   is not related with a stellar lithium line because the rotational velocity of the star , @xmath9  , is too low to explain the broad feature associated with the naphthalene cation .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a companion star can not either explain this feature even for an abnormally high li abundance , @xmath240 + 12 > 5 $ ] dex .",
    "as already stated in cernis ( 1993 ) , the interstellar features , in particular , the naphthalene cation , that appear in the spectrum of cernis  52 may form in the dark cloud l1470 which covers all the cluster ic  348 and is at about the same distance .",
