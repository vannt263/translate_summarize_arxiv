    "<S> these resonances allow us to extract characteristic effective fermi velocities , as high as @xmath1  m / s , for the observed `` dressed '' landau level transitions , as well as the broadening of the resonances , which increases with landau level index .    </S>",
    "<S> scanning confocal raman microscopy has emerged as a key tool for studying the unique properties of graphene . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , raman spectroscopy has proven to be highly useful not only to identify graphene  @xcite , but also to extract information on local doping  @xcite , strain  @xcite , and lattice temperature  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> allows for both ( i ) tuning the landau damping of the highest optical phonon mode at the @xmath2  point ( g  mode ) and ( ii ) shifting the raman line when the g  mode is resonantly coupled to energetically matched ll transitions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these coupled modes are known as magneto - phonon resonances ( mprs ) and they provide a unique way to study electron - phonon interaction and many - body physics . </S>",
    "<S> although different mprs have been measured in magneto - raman experiments on graphene on graphite @xcite and multilayer graphene on sic @xcite and sio@xmath3 @xcite , for exfoliated graphene only a single mpr at around @xmath4  t has been observed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while direct electronic ll - excitations for single- to penta - layer graphene have been recently studied for suspended graphene @xcite , revealing interesting insights into landau level physics , the interaction of landau levels with the g  mode at low magnetic fields for exfoliated single - layer and bilayer graphene has not yet been observed and investigated .     and on hbn . </S>",

    "<S> the high quality of our hbn - graphene - hbn sandwich devices allows us to observe magneto - phonon resonances down to 2.1  t for slg . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to quantitatively study the influence of the electron - phonon interaction on the g  mode at low magnetic fields by pinning the charge carrier density in our samples . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we extract characteristic lifetimes for the observed landau level excitations as well as high values of the effective fermi velocities , a hallmark of electron - electron interaction effects , which appear to be ll transition and/or @xmath0  field dependent . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we report on mprs in bilayer graphene . here </S>",
    "<S> the extracted effective fermi velocities are lower , showing that many - body effects are less pronounced as compared to single - layer graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> a schematic illustration of a typical sample is shown in figure  [ fig1]a , where a graphene flake is partly deposited on sio@xmath5 and partly on hbn . </S>",
    "<S> the upper side of the graphene flake is completely covered with a second hbn flake . </S>",
    "<S> this type of sample gives us invaluable capability to compare the material parameters of the _ same _ graphene flake , where one surface is in direct contact with two kinds of substrates . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a dry and resist - free fabrication method similar to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , where we pick - up an exfoliated graphene flake with an hbn flake and deposit it onto the hbn - sio@xmath3 transition area of the substrate . this procedure has been shown to produce high - quality devices , as proven by transport measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an optical image of such a structure with single - layer graphene is shown in figure  [ fig1]b . in figures  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]d and [ fig1]e we show two raman spectra from the different substrate regions ( see labeled regions and stars in figure  [ fig1]b ) . in both cases the characteristic hbn , g and 2d  peaks are observed . </S>",

    "<S> the 2d  line also contains information on the underlying substrate . </S>",
    "<S> for graphene encapsulated in hbn , we regularly find values of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) down to 16  @xmath6 , while sio@xmath5 supported graphene shows values above 22  @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> an optical image of a bilayer graphene flake encapsulated in hbn is shown in figure  [ fig1]c . </S>",
    "<S> a corresponding raman spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig1]f revealing the typical 2d  line shape , which consists of four lorentzians ( see inset in figure  [ fig1]f ) @xcite .        for the low temperature magneto - raman measurements we employ a commercially available confocal raman setup , allowing us to perform spatially - resolved experiments at a temperature of 4.2  k and magnetic fields of up to 9  t. we use an excitation laser wavelength of 532  nm with a spot diameter on the sample of around 500  nm . for detection , we use a ccd spectrometer with a grating of 1200  lines / mm . </S>",
    "<S> all measurements in this work are performed with linear laser polarization .    in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a we show a color - encoded two - dimensional plot of the raman intensity as a function of magnetic field and raman shift for a spot on the area of slg encapsulated in hbn . for the hbn and 2d  line </S>",
    "<S> we observe only a weak @xmath0  field dependence ( see supplementary information ) , in agreement with earlier studies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the g  line , however , shows significant @xmath0  field dependence , which result from the resonant coupling of the g  mode to inter - band ll transitions whose energies are given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the absolute value of the energy of the @xmath9th landau level . in particular , the feature at @xmath10  t ( see arrows in figure  [ fig2]a ) </S>",
    "<S> can be attributed to the resonant coupling of the @xmath11-transition ( see figure  [ fig2]b ) and the g  mode . </S>",
    "<S> a close - up around the g  line is shown in figure  [ fig2]c , with the arrow highlighting the @xmath11-mpr . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the magneto - raman spectra taken on slg encapsulated in hbn , the spectra obtained on slg deposited on sio@xmath3 do not show any resonant behavior as highlighted in figure  [ fig2]d , indicating the strong influence of the substrate material on the properties of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore focus our discussion on the hbn - slg - hbn data . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a close inspection of the individual raman peaks at different @xmath0 fields ( see figure  [ fig2]e ) reveals that the g  line can be well described by a single lorentzian at all @xmath0  fields even across the resonance .     field as obtained from lorentzian fits to the data . </S>",

    "<S> we observe three resonances at around 2.1  t , 3.7  t , and 5.8  t ( see e.g. arrows in figure  [ fig3]b ) . at these values , the energies of the ll transitions </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 , @xmath11 , and @xmath13 ( see below ) match the energy of the g mode phonon at zero @xmath0 field @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this is highlighted in figure  [ fig3]c , where we show the dependence of @xmath12 and @xmath13 on @xmath0  field ( see also vertical dashed lines in figure  [ fig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant behavior of the most prominent feature at 3.7  t can be further visualized by plotting the data in a three - dimensional representation ( figure  [ fig4]a ) and as an argand diagram ( figure  [ fig4]b ) . when projected on the @xmath22-@xmath23 plane ( figure  [ fig4]b ) the resonance appears as a circle . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is a hallmark of a special case of the dynamics of a non - hermitian two level system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal width of the argand circle @xmath24@xmath6 depends on the strength of the electron - phonon interaction at the @xmath11 level crossing as well as on the charge carrier density @xmath25 , which might block ll excitations due to the pauli principle ( see supplementary information ) , and the lifetimes of the involved states .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) @xmath18 versus @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> . the @xmath0  field value of each point is color encoded and corresponds to the points shown in panel ( a ) . ]    in order to separate the influence of these effects and to gain quantitative values , an independent control of the charge carrier density is desirable . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by repeating the mpr - experiment on an electrically contacted hbn - graphene sandwich device . </S>",
    "<S> although different processing steps , including electron beam lithography , reactive ion etching , and metal ( cr / au ) evaporation , are needed  @xcite , the sample quality allows the observation of mprs of similar quality and at similar @xmath0 fields as for the unprocessed sample in figure  [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of figure  [ fig5]a shows the investigated device . a four - terminal back gate characteristic of the graphene resistance is shown as a black trace in figure  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig5]a and a carrier mobility of around @xmath26  @xmath27/(vs ) and a width of the conductance minimum  @xcite of @xmath28  @xmath29 are extracted from these data ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the high quality of our sample is also seen in the quantum hall measurement ( see figure  [ fig5]b ) , where already at @xmath30  t well - separated lls are established , which is in good agreement with our observation of the @xmath11-mpr . to pin the charge carrier density close to the cnp , we make use of the recently reported photo - doping effect in graphene - hbn - heterostructures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when shining light of sufficient intensity on a gated graphene - hbn sandwich device , nitrogen vacancies or carbon impurities in the hbn can get charged up to the point where they completely screen the electric field due to the applied back - gate voltage . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> laser illumination of a graphene - hbn sandwich device pins the carrier density in graphene very close to the cnp , independent of the applied gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> this happens on time scales much faster than the raman acquisition time , thanks to a laser power of 2  mw at a spot size of 0.25  m@xmath31 , which corresponds to an intensity that is a factor @xmath3210@xmath33 higher than that used in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> the pinning of the carrier density results in the fact that the position and the line width of the g  line become essentially independent of the back - gate voltage , as shown in figure  [ fig5]c . </S>",
    "<S> when turning off the laser , the cnp remains pinned to the last value of the gate voltage that was applied before . </S>",
    "<S> this memory effect , also called photo - induced doping  @xcite , is shown in figure  [ fig5]a , where the red and blue traces represent two back gate characteristics that are shifted by the photo - induced doping effect , but are otherwise nearly unmodified . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , it has been shown that the width @xmath34 of the conductance minimum is independent of the photo - doping value  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is thus a good estimate for the upper limit of the pinned charge - carrier density in graphene under raman measurements . for the investigated sample </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath35  @xmath29 ( see supplementary information ) .        </S>",
    "<S> having knowledge of the charge carrier density , we can now follow ando @xcite and goerbig _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to quantitatively investigate the low @xmath0  field mprs ( see gray data points in figures  [ fig5]d and [ fig5]e ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the dependence of the position @xmath18 and the width @xmath19 of the g  line as a function of the magnetic field can be well understood in terms of the renormalization of the phonon propagator due to electron - phonon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon self - energy @xmath36 for ( nearly ) zero doping is given by    @xmath37    where @xmath38    in the equations above , @xmath39 represents the @xmath40 inter - band ll transition energies , while @xmath12 denotes the energies of the @xmath41 inter - band ll transitions as defined above ( see also figure  [ fig2]b ) . the according @xmath42 and @xmath43 account for the finite lifetimes of the different ll excitations and @xmath44 and @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> denote the coupling constants of the @xmath12- and @xmath46-transitions to the g  mode , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the @xmath46-transitions to the g mode , which has also been observed in previous studies@xcite , is only due to higher order processes @xcite , generally making @xmath47 . the @xmath13  transition , in particular , has to be included as it is needed to account for the resonance at around 5.8  t. since the charge carrier density in our sample is low enough not to affect the strength of the resonances , we do not need to take into account the filling factor dependence of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , near zero doping , all intra - band ll excitations are blocked by the pauli principle .    </S>",
    "<S> the above expression for the phonon self - energy can finally be used to find the pole of the renormalized phonon propagator by solving the equation @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> its roots are related to the position @xmath18 and fwhm @xmath19 of the g  mode via @xmath49 . to account for non - electronic broadening effects , </S>",
    "<S> we make the replacement @xmath50 , with @xmath51 being the broadening of the phonon due to non - electronic processes and @xmath14 the g  mode frequency at zero @xmath0 field .    in figures  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5]d , [ fig5]e and [ fig5]f we show the comparison between calculation and experiment . the strength of the mprs is comparable to that on the unprocessed samples , showing that our etching and contacting techniques do not reduce the device quality . </S>",
    "<S> the red traces show the theoretical result taking a constant fermi velocity of @xmath52  m / s and a constant broadening parameter @xmath53  @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> these two parameters were chosen such that the @xmath11-mpr is described well . </S>",
    "<S> values for the other parameters are obtained as follows . </S>",
    "<S> while the g mode phonon frequency at @xmath54  t , @xmath55  @xmath6 , can be directly extracted from the data , the non - electronic phonon broadening @xmath56  @xmath6 can be extracted from the residual @xmath19 at higher magnetic fields ( e.g. at 8  t ) where no ll transitions are energetically matched with the phonon mode . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - phonon coupling parameter @xmath57 is fixed by the value of @xmath19 at very low magnetic fields as it has to guarantee the right amount of landau damping . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted @xmath44 is in good agreement with values reported by other groups @xcite . for the phenomenologically introduced @xmath45 we used a value of @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> a constant @xmath59 for all ll excitations evidently overestimates the strength of the mprs at low magnetic field values ( see arrows in figure 5d ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the positions of the resonances do not match between theory and experiment if a constant fermi velocity is used for all ll excitations ( see vertical dashed lines in figures  [ fig5]e and [ fig5]f ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the @xmath13-mpr appears in the calculation at a lower magnetic field value than in the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we thus phenomenologically modify the model and assign different widths and effective fermi velocities ( following shizuya  @xcite ) to the three visible mprs ( see caption of figure  [ fig5 ] and table  [ tab1 ] ) and end up with the blue traces in figures  [ fig5]d-5f , which are in better quantitative agreement with the experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we observe that the extracted effective fermi velocities are significantly higher compared to earlier mpr and infrared measurements on graphene and graphene related systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the high values of @xmath60 to many - body effects which arise since our samples consist of exfoliated graphene single - layers with low doping and low doping fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> so far only suspended slg showed similarly high values @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath60  values we extracted from the measurement of mprs on 13 spots on three different samples are displayed in table  [ tab1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the errors on @xmath60 are below @xmath61  m / s . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted values indicate that @xmath60 decreases with @xmath0  field and might also depend on the transition as has been predicted by theory @xcite .    finally , we find that the widths of the ll excitations are strongly dependent on the ll indices of the involved states ( see last column in table 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic lifetime decreases with increasing ll index , resulting in strong suppression of all @xmath12 for @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> this observation might be attributed to the additional decay channels arising from an increased number of energetically lower and unoccupied lls for excitations with higher @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can not gain independent insights on the @xmath0 field dependence of the ll broadening  @xcite as we are limited to extract @xmath63 for each transition from the corresponding mpr .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      ( blue lines ) as a function of @xmath0  field . </S>",
    "<S> the black line represents the phonon frequency at zero @xmath0  field . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) and ( c ) @xmath18 and @xmath19 as functions of @xmath0  field . </S>",
    "<S> the data points are extracted from lorentzian fits to data taken on the sample shown in figure  [ fig1]c . a running average of 25  mt was used . </S>",
    "<S> the red lines are computed using equation eq .  </S>",
    "<S> s2 ( see supplementary information ) with the parameters given in the text . ]    </S>",
    "<S> our fabrication technique , yielding samples with high carrier mobility and low doping , can also be applied to bilayer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to investigate mprs in exfoliated blg , which could not have been studied earlier . </S>",
    "<S> the most relevant ll transitions in blg are inter - band excitations in the lower subbands , which we also denote by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 now denotes the energy of a landau level in the lower subband of blg ( see supplementary information ) and @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> their evolution with @xmath0  field is shown in figure  [ fig6]a . </S>",
    "<S> as for the case of slg , we fit single lorentzians to every raman spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 as a function of @xmath0  field are shown in figures  [ fig6]b and [ fig6]c , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> two resonances at around 6.4  t and 8.1  t can be well identified , which can be attributed to the ll transitions @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the red curves are calculated using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> s2 ( see supplementary information ) , with @xmath69  m / s , @xmath70 , @xmath71  @xmath6 , @xmath72  @xmath6 and @xmath73  @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the magnitudes of the resonances below 9  t are significantly lower as compared to the case of single - layer graphene ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) , which , however , is in good agreement with our calculation . interestingly , </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to single - layer graphene , a constant fermi velocity is sufficient to describe our data . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , compared to slg , the fermi velocity is reduced , indicating that electron - electron interaction effects play a minor role in bilayer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we do not know the charge carrier doping in our bilayer sample , a suppression of many - body effects might also be due to finite charge carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to describe both resonances with the same ll exciton broadening .    in summary , we investigated the @xmath0  field dependence of the g  line phonon renormalization of exfoliated single - layer and bilayer graphene for low magnetic fields . for single - layer graphene </S>",
    "<S> we have compared the substrate influence of sio@xmath3 and hbn . </S>",
    "<S> while no distinct features could be observed on sio@xmath3 , the raman spectra on hbn showed distinct magneto - phonon resonances . for a quantitative discussion of the parameters involved in the coupling of landau level transitions to the raman g  mode we investigated an electrically contacted graphene sample to pin the charge carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> we found high effective fermi velocities of up to @xmath1  m / s , which varied for the three observed ll excitations . due to the low charge carrier density , we attribute this finding to many - body contributions to the energy of the ll excitons . </S>",
    "<S> we show that landau level excitations with higher landau level index have reduced lifetimes , possibly linked to the existence of an increased number of intermediate ll states that lead to additional decay channels . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we observed mprs in exfoliated bilayer graphene . here , a constant fermi velocity and a single landau level excitation width for all resonances is sufficient to reach good agreement with theory . </S>",
    "<S> our work paves the way towards a more refined understanding of electronic many - body effects in the presence of magnetic fields in single - layer and bilayer graphene and can be easily extended to other two - dimensional materials . </S>"
