    "approximately half of the elements heavier than iron in the universe are produced via a series of @xmath12 neutron capture reactions and competing @xmath13-decays ( the @xmath9-process ) . during the @xmath9-process",
    ", the neutron number density is relatively low , of the order of 10@xmath14 n @xmath15 .",
    "when the flux reaches an unstable nucleus , it typically decays rather than capture another neutron and the @xmath9-process proceeds via the isotopes around the valley of @xmath13-stability ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the astrophysical sites of the @xmath9-process are core he and shell c burning in massive stars for the elements lighter than sr @xcite , and the `` he intershell '' of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars for the elements between sr and bi @xcite .",
    "stars with initial masses lower than roughly 9 @xmath11 reach the agb phase in the final phases of their evolution , when both h and he have been exhausted in the core leaving c and o in electron degenerate conditions .",
    "production of nuclear energy occurs in the h and he shells , which are located between the core and the extended convective envelope and are separated by the thin he intershell layer .",
    "agb stars experience thermal pulses ( tps ) when the usually dormant he burning shell is suddenly activated .",
    "a large amount of energy is released , which drives convection in the he intershell . during tps",
    "the star expands and cools and the h burning shell is inactive .",
    "while he burning turns from the convective to the radiative regime , and eventually switches off , the convective envelope can penetrate the underlying he intershell and carry to the surface the products of he burning , in particular carbon and the elements heavier than iron made by the @xmath9-process .",
    "this mixing process is known as the `` third dredge - up '' ( tdu ) .",
    "after the tdu is ended , the star contracts and heats up again and h burning resumes until another tp occurs and the cycle is repeated .",
    "this sequence of events can occur from a few times to hundreds of times , depending on the stellar mass and the mass - loss rate .",
    "agb stars suffer from very strong stellar winds , which erode the envelope roughly within a million years and shed the newly synthesized material mixed to the surface by the tdu into the interstellar medium .",
    "eventually , the c - o degenerate core is left as a cooling white dwarf ( see * ? ? ? * for a review on agb stars ) .    according to the current standard model @xcite",
    ", some protons must diffuse from the convective envelope into the he intershell at the end of each tdu in order to produce enough @xmath4c to account for the observed abundances of the @xmath9-process elements at the surface of agb stars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a thin layer",
    "is then produced , known as the @xmath4c `` pocket '' , which is rich in @xmath4c made via @xmath16c(@xmath17,@xmath18)@xmath4n(@xmath19)@xmath4c .",
    "when in this region the temperature reaches about @xmath20 k , the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o reaction is activated and generates neutrons that trigger the @xmath9-process @xcite .",
    "considerable effort has been devoted to the direct measurement of the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o cross section @xcite .",
    "these measurements have been performed at energies down to 270 kev , whereas the gamow window is at 190 @xmath21 40 kev , corresponding to a temperature of 100 mk .",
    "since this energy is far below the coulomb barrier , the reaction cross section is extremely small and direct measurement is sensitively limited by background signals and very difficult to perform in laboratories on the earth s surface . while a measurement has been proposed at the underground laboratory of luna @xcite , at present , the experimental cross sections have to be extrapolated below 270 kev .",
    "a microscopic cluster model analysis of the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o and @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath0 ) reactions by @xcite suggested that this extrapolation is critically affected by the 1/2@xmath2 subthreshold resonance in @xmath3o ( @xmath22 = 6.356 mev , just 3 kev below the @xmath0-decay threshold ) .",
    "the contribution from this resonance depends strongly on the @xmath0-width of the 1/2@xmath2 state in @xmath3o , which can be derived from the spectroscopic factor ( @xmath1 ) or the asymptotic normalization coefficient ( anc ) of @xmath0-cluster in this state .",
    "the @xmath1 and the anc can be determined from the angular distribution of the direct @xmath0-transfer reaction using distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) or coupled reaction channels ( crc ) analysis .",
    "although three indirect measurements via the ( @xmath23li,@xmath24 ) or the ( @xmath6li,@xmath25 ) system have been performed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to study the @xmath1 or the anc of the 1/2@xmath2 state , there still exists a significant discrepancy of up to a factor of @xmath1030 in the derived @xmath1 and anc .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to perform a new measurement of the @xmath1 and the anc via an independent transfer reaction .",
    "in addition , it is necessary to understand the impact of the different resulting @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o rates on the @xmath9-process nucleosynthesis in agb stars .    in this paper",
    "we determine a new stellar rate of the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o reaction and incorporate it in calculations of the @xmath9-process nucleosynthesis in agb stars .",
    "first , we measure the angular distribution of the @xmath4c(@xmath5b,@xmath6li)@xmath3o reaction to determine the @xmath1 and the anc for the 1/2@xmath2 state in @xmath3o . using this experimental anc",
    "we derive the @xmath0-width for the 1/2@xmath2 subthreshold resonance , which is currently the most uncertain parameter for determining the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o rate .",
    "finally , we use the new rate and different rates available in the literature as input for simulations of agb stars to study their influence on the abundance of some selected @xmath9-process elements and isotopic ratios .",
    "the measurement of the angular distribution for the @xmath4c(@xmath5b,@xmath6li)@xmath3o reaction was performed at the hi-13 tandem accelerator of china institute of atomic energy ( ciae ) in beijing .",
    "we used a @xmath5b beam with an energy of 50 mev leading to the production of the excited states in @xmath3o at @xmath22 = 3.055 mev , 3.843 mev , 4.554 mev and 6.356 mev .",
    "the angular distribution of the elastic scattering for the entrance channel ( @xmath5b+@xmath4c ) was also measured .",
    "we used a self - supporting @xmath4c target with a thickness of 75@xmath216 @xmath26g/@xmath27 and an initial purity of 88% .",
    "a 26 mev @xmath14li beam was also delivered for measurement of the exit channel ( @xmath14li+@xmath3o ) elastic scattering .",
    "natural silicon monoxide of 86@xmath217 @xmath26g/@xmath27 was prepared onto a 40@xmath213 @xmath26g/@xmath27 carbon foil , serving as the oxygen target .",
    "in addition , a self - supporting @xmath16c target of 66@xmath215 @xmath26g/@xmath27 was used for calibration of the focal plane and background subtraction during the whole experiment .    to monitor the possible buildup of @xmath16c , the @xmath5b elastic scattering on the @xmath4c target was measured at the start and at the end of the measurement for each angle .",
    "this showed that the @xmath16c buildup was negligible compared to the initial impurity in the @xmath4c target , possibly due to the rather low gas pressure ( @xmath2810@xmath29 mb ) in the reaction chamber . to determine the absolute amount of @xmath16c in the @xmath4c target we measured the angular distributions of the @xmath5b+@xmath16c elastic scattering with both the natural @xmath16c target and the enriched @xmath4c target .",
    "the absolute amounts of @xmath16c and @xmath4c in the @xmath4c target were found to be 9.0@xmath210.7 and 66@xmath215 @xmath26g/@xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the beam current was measured by a faraday cup covering an angular range of @xmath306@xmath31 in a laboratory frame and used for the absolute normalization of the cross sections at @xmath32 .",
    "the faraday cup was removed when measuring the cross sections at @xmath33 . a si @xmath34 telescope located at @xmath35",
    "was employed for the relative normalization of the cross sections at @xmath33 by measuring the elastic scattering of the incident ions on the targets .",
    "in addition , the ratio of current integration in the faraday cup to the elastic scattering events was measured at the start and the end of the measurement for each angle @xmath33 by restoring the faraday cup .",
    "the ratios changed by less than 2% , which thus led to a reliable normalization of the cross sections at @xmath33 .",
    "the reaction products were focused and separated by a q3d magnetic spectrograph and recorded by a two - dimensional position - sensitive silicon detector ( pssd , 50@xmath3650 mm ) fixed at the focal plane of the spectrograph .",
    "the two - dimensional position information from the pssd enabled the products emitted into the acceptable solid angle to be recorded completely .",
    "the energy information from the pssd was used to remove the impurities with the same magnetic rigidity .    due to the presence of @xmath16c in the @xmath4c target ,",
    "the @xmath14li events from the @xmath4c(@xmath5b,@xmath6li)@xmath3o@xmath37 ( 6.356 mev ) reaction were mixed with those from the @xmath16c(@xmath5b,@xmath6li)@xmath8o@xmath37 ( 6.917 mev ) reaction . to evaluate this background",

    "note that the measurements for these three states were not affected by the @xmath16c background .",
    "the finite - range distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) method with the fresco code @xcite was used to analyze the experimental angular distributions of the transfer reaction .",

    "we included the formation of the @xmath4c pocket by artificially allowing an exponentially decreasing proton profile to form just below the base of the convective envelope at the end of each tdu episode over a mass of 0.002 @xmath11 ( roughly 1/10@xmath98 of the mass of the he intershell , in the low - mass agb models considered here ) .",
    "the details of this procedure and the codes used to compute the models have been described previously ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we considered four models , which are summarized in table [ tab5 ] : a @xmath993 @xmath11 model of metallicity @xmath1000.02 similar to that discussed by @xcite , a @xmath991.8 @xmath11 model of @xmath1000.01 from @xcite , and @xmath991 @xmath11 and @xmath991.5 @xmath11 models of @xmath1000.0001 from @xcite .",
    "we selected these models for three reasons .",
    "( 1 ) models of higher masses probably do not experience the @xmath4c neutron source as protons burn while being ingested in the he intershell , preventing the formation of the @xmath4c pocket @xcite .",
    "it is still not clear what the effect of this burning is on the whole stellar structure and the @xmath9-process , but it seems reasonable to us for the time being to not include a @xmath4c pocket for masses larger than @xmath104 @xmath11 . in these massive agb stars ,",
    "the temperature in the tps exceeds 300 mk so that the @xmath101ne(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath102 mg reaction is activated and likely plays the role of the main neutron source @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the @xmath4c in the pocket normally burns before the onset of the following tp @xcite , however , in some cases the temperature may not be high enough for this to happen and some @xmath4c could be left over to burn in the following tp ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our lowest - mass models",
    "the first few @xmath4c pockets are ingested in the following tp while they still contain a relatively large amount of @xmath4c .",
    "these models are thus qualitatively different from the @xmath993 @xmath11 model where @xmath4c always burns before the onset of the next tp . in details , we have 6 , 15 , and 2 tdu episodes in the @xmath991.8 @xmath11 model of @xmath1000.01 , and the @xmath991.5 @xmath11 and @xmath991 @xmath11 models of @xmath1000.0001 , respectively .",
    "these numbers represent also the number of @xmath4c pockets introduced in each models , since a @xmath4c pocket is introduced after each tdu episode . of these @xmath4c pockets ,",
    "the first 4 and 3 for the @xmath991.8 @xmath11 and @xmath991.5 @xmath11 models , respectively , are ingested in the following tp while the abundance of @xmath4c by number is still higher than 10@xmath103 .",
    "the same occurs for both the @xmath4c pockets introduced in the @xmath991 @xmath11 model . as the agb star evolves the temperature in the he intershell increases so that this effect disappears for later @xmath4c pockets .",
    "the exact number of ingested @xmath4c pockets relative to their total number increases with decreasing the stellar mass and increasing the metallicity .",
    "this is because the temperature decreases for lower masses and higher metallicities and thus the chance of some unburnt @xmath4c surviving to be ingested in the next tp is higher .",
    "( 3 ) finally the low - mass and low - metallicity models ( 1 @xmath11 and 1.5 @xmath11 , @xmath104=0.0001 ) present a further regime for the activation of the @xmath4c neutron source .",
    "proton ingestion episodes occur in the first few tps during which a small amount of protons are ingested directly inside the tps and thus some extra @xmath4c is produced and burnt inside these convective regions @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we schematically illustrate the location in time and space where the different regimes operate within the thermally - pulsating structure of an agb star and indicate the models where the regimes occur .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we display the variations of the abundance of some selected @xmath9-process elements and isotopic ratios at stellar surface at the end of the evolution obtained from our models using the present @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o rate with respect to the two compilations , cf88 and nacre , respectively ( see fig . [ fig5 ] for a comparison of reaction rates ) .",
    "the results obtained using the rates from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite agree with the present rate within 10% for all the models .",
    "the rate from @xcite produces larger variations , but always within those reported for the cf88 and nacre rates . using the rate from @xcite on the other hand produces variations outside of the ranges in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , e.g. , pb is up to 40% lower than the value obtained using the present rate .",
    "we chose to plot the elements representing the first @xmath9-process peak ( sr ) , the second @xmath9-process peak ( ba ) , and the third @xmath9-process peak ( pb ) .",
    "these can be observed in stars and provide a description of the overall @xmath9-process distribution , which is a function of the total time - integrated neutron flux .",
    "we further plot two isotopic ratios : @xmath105zr/@xmath106zr and @xmath107kr/@xmath108kr .",
    "these are sensitive to the activation of the branching points at @xmath109zr and @xmath110kr , respectively , and thus to the local value of the neutron density .",
    "these ratios can be measured in meteoritic stardust silicon carbide ( sic ) grains that originated in c - rich agb stars .",
    "we also report on the production of fluorine , however , we find that its production is not significantly sensitive ( by @xmath11110% at most ) to the choice of the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o reaction in all four models ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in the 1.8 @xmath11 , @xmath1000.01 model we find that the overall @xmath9-process distribution changes when different @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o rates are used .",
    "the present rate produces 16% more ba and 25% more pb than the slower cf88 rate . on the other hand , the present rate results in a 14% lower abundance of pb than the faster nacre rate .",
    "these differences are a signature of a different efficiency of the @xmath9-process .",
    "a lower efficiency produces less ba and pb than sr because for the neutron capture flux to reach ba and pb higher number of neutrons per fe seed are required . slower rate results in more @xmath4c",
    "left over in the pocket to be engulfed in the following tp and the @xmath9-process is less efficient when @xmath4c is engulfed in the tp than when @xmath4c burns radiatively for two reasons .",
    "( i ) in the radiative @xmath4c pocket there is no mixing among the different layers of the pocket and thus @xmath112n nuclei produced in the region of the pocket where the initial number of proton is higher than 0.01 are not mixed to the @xmath4c - rich layer .",
    "this produces the highest @xmath9-process efficiency because @xmath112n is a neutron poison via the @xmath112n(@xmath113)@xmath112c reaction , which removes neutrons from being captured by fe seeds and their progeny . in the convective tp instead @xmath4c nuclei",
    "are mixed with the @xmath112n present in the pocket as well as in the h burning ashes .",
    "( ii ) the neutrons in the radiative @xmath4c pocket are released over a very small mass ( 0.002 @xmath11 in our models ) , there are more neutrons present locally per initial fe seed and the flux of neutron captures can reach to the heaviest elements up to pb . in the convective tp instead",
    "the neutrons are released over a larger mass ( @xmath100.01@xmath450.02 @xmath11 in our models ) , there are less neutrons per fe seed resulting in the production of the lighter @xmath9-process elements like sr .",
    "the isotopic ratios plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] behave in the opposite way of pb because the local neutron density is higher , and thus branching points are more activated , when @xmath4c is ingested in the tps due to the higher temperature resulting in a shorter burning timescale .",
    "interestingly , the low - metallicity @xmath114 models present the opposite result to the @xmath115 model . e.g. , in the 1 @xmath11 model the present rate produces 25% less pb than the slower cf88 rate .",
    "these stellar models have lower masses and a much larger fraction of @xmath4c burns while ingested in the tp , together with @xmath112n , due to both incomplete burning of the @xmath4c pocket before the next tp and the proton ingestion episodes .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath112n acts a neutron poison via the ( @xmath113 ) channel , but at the same time it is destroyed by @xmath0-captures in the tp .",
    "hence , the timescale of @xmath4c ingestion and burning with respect to that of @xmath112n has an impact on the final neutron flux .",
    "this could explain why slower @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o rates produce more free neutrons since if neutrons are released at later times there is less @xmath112n to capture them .",
    "in these conditions , one should also consider the effect of recycling of the protons made by the @xmath112n(@xmath113)@xmath112c reaction .",
    "these protons can be captured by the abundant @xmath16c to make more @xmath4c , but also by @xmath4c itself .",
    "it is difficult to evaluate analytically the final outcome of all these combined effects .",
    "overall , our numerical models , which solve simultaneously mixing and burning in the tps , indicate that the present rate results in a lower overall neutron flux than the cf88 rate .",
    "this is accompanied by a higher or a lower neutron density , depending on the stellar mass and the exact ratio of @xmath4c burning convectively to @xmath4c burning radiatively .",
    "17% lower and 22% higher @xmath107kr/@xmath108kr ratios , which are extremely sensitive to even small changes in the neutron density , are obtained for the 1 @xmath11 and 1.5 @xmath11 models , respectively .    in the 3 @xmath11 , @xmath1000.02 model we do not find any variations in the resulting abundances within 5% .",
    "this is because in this model @xmath4c always completely burns before the onset of the next tp .",
    "the total integrated neutron flux is thus determined only by the initial amount of @xmath4c in the pocket and not by how fast it burns .",
    "we expect the same behavior for more massive agb model if a @xmath4c pocket was to be considered in these cases .",
    "the isotopic ratios in this model are also not sensitive to the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o rate as they depend mainly on the neutrons released in the tps when the @xmath101ne neutron source is marginally activated .",
    "it is interesting to compare the predicted abundances of the @xmath9-process elements and isotopic ratios with the observations .",
    "we find that some differences up to 25% are predicted by the @xmath9-process models , particularly for pb , when varying the @xmath4c burning rates .",
    "pb can be measured in carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars in the milky way halo , which are believed to carry the chemical signature of mass transfer from a more massive companion during its agb phase .",
    "however , the spectroscopic abundances in @xmath9-process - enhanced stars are currently determined with typical uncertainties around 80% ( see table 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , larger than the differences found here .",
    "in addition , the formation of the @xmath4c pocket itself is very uncertain and there is no agreement on exactly which mechanism drives it , and on the impact of processes such as rotation and magnetic fields .",
    "also the details of the proton ingestion episodes found in our low - metallicity models depend on the treatment of convective borders in stars , one of the largest uncertainties in stellar modeling .",
    "future observations with high resolution and high signal to noise ratio spectra of low - metallicity stars , and further understanding of the formation of the @xmath4c pocket and the proton ingestion episodes will be all important for better constraining the @xmath9-process model predictions .",
    "isotopic ratios affected by branching points are indicative of the @xmath4c burning rate , even though also in this case , other uncertainties including the neutron - capture cross section of the unstable nucleus at the branching point may have a more important effect .",
    "the @xmath105zr/@xmath106zr ratio has been measured in s - type agb stars and in meteoritic stardust sic grains that originated from agb stars of roughly solar metallicity .",
    "the data of @xmath105zr/@xmath106zr from meteoritic grains are more precise ( with uncertainties as low as 5%@xmath4510% , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than the data from s - type stars , where often it was only possible to derive upper limits @xcite .",
    "the differences of 22% found here when changing the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o rate do not drastically change the interpretation of the data , which mostly indicate strong deficits in @xmath105zr , with respect to solar , and are overall matched by agb models @xcite . in the case of @xmath107kr/@xmath108kr ,",
    "stardust sic data range from @xmath100.5 to 2 of the solar ratio of 1.52 @xcite .",
    "our agb models of metallicity around solar ( @xmath104=0.01,0.02 ) , which are believed to well represent the parent stars of this stardust , only produce @xmath107kr/@xmath108kr ratios lower than solar .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the @xmath107kr atoms are probably implanted in sic by the high - velocity winds experienced during the evolution that follows the agb , the post - agb and the planetary nebula nucleus phases .",
    "the effect of the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o reaction rate needs to be evaluated with regards to the composition of kr inside the he intershell , which is exposed to the surface during these final phases of the evolution instead of the surface abundances as done in the present work . in this context",
    "the possibility of a proton ingestion in the very late tp sometimes occurring during the post - agb evolution also has to be taken into account .",
    "first simulations of this proton ingestion event by @xcite have shown that the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o reaction rate plays a main role in determining the final abundances ( see their fig .",
    "these models need to be further investigated in relation to the present @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o reaction rate and the @xmath107kr/@xmath108kr ratios in sic grains .",
    "we determined the stellar rate of the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o reaction and incorporated the new reaction rate in calculations of the @xmath9-process nucleosynthesis in agb stars .",
    "the @xmath1 and anc for the 6.356 mev 1/2@xmath2 subthreshold state in @xmath3o were obtained from the measurement of the @xmath4c(@xmath5b,@xmath6li)@xmath3o angular distribution .",
    "this provided an independent examination to shed some light on the existing discrepancies in the @xmath1 and anc values derived from different authors .",
    "based on the measured anc , we extracted the @xmath0-width of the 1/2@xmath2 state in @xmath3o , which is currently the most uncertain parameter for determining the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o reaction rate . by using the present @xmath0-width and considering the properties of @xmath3o states up to 8.342 mev as well as their interferences , we derived the astrophysical s - factor and the stellar rate of the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o reaction . at a temperature of 100 mk",
    "the new rate is roughly two times larger than the cf88 value and two times smaller than that recommended by nacre ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . verification of the present result using other independent techniques is desirable , e.g. , the trojan horse approach @xcite , and the isospin symmetry approach based on a measurement of the 1/2@xmath2 6.560 mev state in @xmath3f @xcite .",
    "in addition , an extension of the experimental data of @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o toward lower energies is highly desirable , which can probably only be performed in an underground laboratory , e.g. , luna ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we incorporated different @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o reaction rates in calculations of the @xmath9-process nucleosynthesis in agb stars and found that : ( 1 ) if @xmath4c burns completely in radiative conditions during the interpulse phase ( as for stars of initial mass greater than @xmath102 @xmath11 ) , there is no change in the final results . ( 2 ) if some @xmath4c burns instead inside the convective tps ( for stars of initial mass lower than @xmath102 @xmath11 ) , we find changes of up to 25% in the @xmath9-process results , particularly for pb . there are model uncertainties related to the result of point ( 2 ) : a ) when @xmath4c burning in the tps is due to incomplete burning of the @xmath4c during the interpulse period , the exact stellar mass and metallicity range where incomplete burning of the @xmath4c during the interpulse period occurs , as well as tp numbers , and the exact amount of @xmath4c ingested , all depend sensitively on the temperature and density in the @xmath4c pocket , on the interpulse period , and on the details of the inclusion of the @xmath4c pocket .",
    "b ) when @xmath4c burning in the tps is due to ingestion of protons directly inside the tp ( as in low - mass and low - metallicity stars , as well as in post - agb stars experiencing a late tp , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the amount of @xmath4c and neutrons produced strongly depends on the physical and numerical treatment of the mixing scheme adopted , which is at present uncertain .    due to these model uncertainties together with the fact that the stellar observations have relatively large error bars , it is presently not possible to conclude if the new rate of the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o reaction provides the best match to the available observational constraints .",
    "this may be however possible in the future , when development of recent 3d hydrodynamical models of the proton ingestion episodes @xcite will allow a better understanding of neutron production and the @xmath9-process inside tps to be compared to the composition of stellar observations and stardust grains .",

    "<S> we present a new measurement of the @xmath0-spectroscopic factor ( @xmath1 ) and the asymptotic normalization coefficient ( anc ) for the 6.356 mev 1/2@xmath2 subthreshold state of @xmath3o through the @xmath4c(@xmath5b,@xmath6li)@xmath3o transfer reaction and we determine the @xmath0-width of this state . </S>",
    "<S> this is believed to have a strong effect on the rate of the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o reaction , the main neutron source for _ slow _ neutron captures ( the @xmath9-process ) in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . </S>",
    "<S> based on the new width we derive the astrophysical s - factor and the stellar rate of the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o reaction . at a temperature of 100 mk </S>",
    "<S> our rate is roughly two times larger than that by @xcite and two times smaller than that recommended by the nacre compilation . </S>",
    "<S> we use the new rate and different rates available in the literature as input in simulations of agb stars to study their influence on the abundances of selected @xmath9-process elements and isotopic ratios . </S>",
    "<S> there are no changes in the final results using the different rates for the @xmath4c(@xmath0,@xmath7)@xmath8o reaction when the @xmath4c burns completely in radiative conditions . when the @xmath4c burns in convective conditions , as in stars of initial mass lower than @xmath102 @xmath11 and in post - agb stars , some changes are to be expected , e.g. , of up to 25% for pb in our models . </S>",
    "<S> these variations will have to be carefully analyzed when more accurate stellar mixing models and more precise observational constraints are available .    </S>"
