    "in addition to their theoretical significance in complex analysis , conformal mappings are important in classical engineering applications , such as electrostatics and aerodynamics @xcite , but also in novel areas such as computer graphics and computational modeling @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study numerical computation of conformal mappings @xmath0 of a domain @xmath1 into @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the domain is bounded and that there are either one or two simple ( and non - intersecting ) boundary curves , i.e. , the domain @xmath3 is either simply or doubly connected .",
    "it is usually convenient to map the domains conformally onto canonical domains , which are in our case rectangles @xmath4 or annuli @xmath5 .",
    "while the existence of such conformal mappings is expected because of riemann s mapping theorem , it is usually not possible to obtain a formula or other representation for the mapping analytically .",
    "several different algorithms for numerical computation of conformal mappings have been described in the literature .",
    "one popular method involves the schwarz - christoffel formula , which can also be generalized for doubly connected domains .",
    "a widely used matlab implementation of this method is due to driscoll @xcite and a fortran version for the doubly connected case is due to hu @xcite . for theoretical background concerning these methods",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are several approaches which do not involve the schwarz - christoffel formula , e.g. , the zipper algorithm of marshall @xcite .",
    "a method involving the harmonic conjugate function is presented in @xcite , but this method is different from ours as it does not use quadrilaterals . for an overview of numerical conformal mappings and moduli of quadrilaterals ,",
    "see @xcite . historical remarks and an outline of development of numerical methods in conformal mappings",
    "is given in @xcite .    in this paper , we present a new method for constructing numerical conformal mappings .",
    "the method is based on the harmonic conjugate function and properties of quadrilaterals , which together form the foundation of our numerical algorithm .",
    "the algorithm is based on solving numerically the laplace equation subject to dirichlet - neumann mixed - type boundary conditions , which is described in @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first attempt to construct conformal mappings by using @xmath6-fem .",
    "it should be noted , that the presented method is not restricted to polygonal domains , and can be used with domains with curvilinear boundary as well .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "first the preliminary concepts are introduced and then the new algorithm is described in detail . before the numerical examples , the computational complexity and some details of our implementation are discussed .",
    "the numerical examples are divided into three sections : validation against the schwarz - christoffel toolbox , the analytic example , simply connected domains , and finally ring domains .",
    "in this section we introduce the required concepts from function theory , and present a proof of a fundamental result leading to a numerical algorithm .",

    "the dirichlet - neumann problem can be solved by using any suitable numerical method .",
    "one could also solve the cauchy - riemann equations numerically ( see e.g. @xcite ) but it is not necessary .",
    "instead we solve @xmath40 directly from the conjugate problem , which is usually computationally much more efficient , because the mesh and the discretized system used in solving the potential function @xmath22 can be used for solving @xmath40 as well .",

    "2 .   solve the dirichlet - neumann problem associated with @xmath27 to obtain @xmath100 .",
    "3 .   then @xmath101 is the conformal mapping from @xmath9 onto @xmath43 such that the vertices @xmath102 are mapped onto the corners @xmath103 .    in the case of ring domains ,",
    "the construction of the conformal mapping is slightly different .",
    "the necessary steps are described below and in figure [ fig : algorithm ] .",

    "3 .   use the algorithm [ alg : hqr ] .",
    "note that the choice of the steepest descent curve is not unique due to the implicit orthogonality condition .",
    "the @xmath6-fem implementation we are using is described in detail in @xcite . for elliptic problems ,",
    "the superior accuracy of the higher order methods with relatively small number of unknowns has to be balanced against the much higher integration cost and the cost of evaluating the solution at any given point in the domain .",
    "it should be emphasized though , that the conjugate function method is not dependent on any particular numerical pde solution technique .",
    "indeed , we fully expect that similar results could be obtained with , for instance , fine - tuned integral equation solvers .    in the context of solution of the conjugate pair problems , it is obvious that we have to integrate only once .",
    "moreover , the factorization of the resulting discretized systems can be , for the most part , used in both problems without any extra work .",
    "therefore , although in principle two problems are solved , in practice the work is almost proportional to that of one .",
    "however , the computation of the contour lines necessarily involves a large number of evaluations of the solution , that also become more expensive as the order of the method increases .",
    "here we give a short overview of the @xmath6-fem following closely to the one in @xcite . in the @xmath106-version of the fem",
    "the polynomial degree @xmath106 is used to control the accuracy of the solution while keeping the mesh fixed in contrast to the @xmath11-version or standard finite element method , where the polynomial degree is constant but the mesh size varies .",
    "thus , the @xmath106-version is often referred to as the @xmath106-extension .",
    "the @xmath6-method simply combines the @xmath11- and @xmath106- refinements .",
    "these different refinement strategies also imply different sets of unknowns or degrees of freedom : in the @xmath11-version or the standard finite element method , the unknowns or degrees of freedom are associated with values at specified locations of the discretization of the computational domain , that is , the nodes of the mesh . in the @xmath106-method , the unknowns are coefficients of some polynomials that are associated with topological entities of the elements , nodes , sides , and the interior .    for optimal @xmath6-convergence one should refine the mesh geometrically toward corners and let the degree of polynomial shape functions increase with distance from the corners .",
    "for an example of such a mesh see figure  [ fig : mesh ] . in the examples computed below ,",
    "we have used a constant value of the order over the whole mesh .    in the following one way to construct a @xmath106-type quadrilateral element",
    "the construction of triangles follows similar lines .",
    "first of all , the choice of shape functions is not unique .",
    "we use the so - called hierarchic integrated legendre shape functions .",
    "the integrated legendre polynomials are defined for @xmath111 $ ] as @xmath112 and can be rewritten as linear combinations of legendre polynomials @xmath113 the normalizing coefficients are chosen so that @xmath114    using these polynomials we can now define the shape functions for a quadrilateral reference element over the domain @xmath115\\times[-1,1]$ ] .",
    "the shape functions are divided into three categories : nodal shape functions , side modes , and internal modes .",
    "there are four nodal shape functions . @xmath116 which taken alone",
    "define the standard four - node quadrilateral finite element .",
    "there are @xmath117 side modes associated with the sides of a quadrilateral @xmath118 , with @xmath119 , @xmath120 for the internal modes we choose the @xmath121 shape functions @xmath122 the internal shape functions are often referred to as bubble - functions .",
    "note that some additional book - keeping is necessary .",
    "the legendre polynomials have the property @xmath123 .",
    "this means that every edge must be globally parameterized in the same way in both elements to where it belongs .",
    "otherwise unexpected cancellation in the degrees of freedom associated with the odd edge modes could occur .",
    "let us divide the degrees of freedom of a discretized quadrilateral into five sets , internal and boundary degrees of freedom .",
    "the sets are denoted @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , for internal , dirichlet @xmath126 , dirichlet @xmath93 , neumann with dirichlet @xmath126 in the conjugate problem , and neumann with dirichlet @xmath93 in the conjugate problem , degrees of freedom , respectively .",
    "the discretized system is @xmath127 taking the dirichlet boundary conditions into account , we arrive at the following system of equations , using @xmath128 , @xmath129 for the conjugate problem , simply change the roles of @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "note that @xmath132 is present in both systems and thus _ has to be factored only once_.      let @xmath22 and @xmath40 be solutions of the dirichlet - neumann problem and its conjugate problem , respectively . in computing",
    "the contour lines , the solutions and their gradients have to be evaluated at many points @xmath133 .",
    "evaluation of the solution in @xmath6-fem is more complicated than in the standard fem . in a reference - element - based system such as ours , in order to evaluate the solution at point @xmath133 one must first find the enclosing element and then the local coordinates of the point on that element .",
    "then every shape function has to be evaluated at the local coordinates of the point .",
    "this is outlined in detail in algorithm [ alg : hpeval ] .",
    "similarly evaluation of the gradient of the solution requires two polynomial evaluations per one geometric search .      1 .",
    "find the enclosing element of @xmath133 .",
    "2 .   find the local coordinates @xmath135 on the element .",
    "3 .   evaluate the shape functions @xmath136 .",
    "4 .   compute the linear combination of the shape functions @xmath137 , where @xmath138 are the coefficients from the solution vector .    finding the images of the canonical domains",
    "is equivalent to finding the corresponding contour lines of @xmath22 and @xmath40 .",
    "since both solutions have been computed on the same mesh , evaluating the solutions and their gradients at the same point is straightforward . in algorithm [ alg : contour ]",
    "the two - level line search is described in detail .      1 .",
    "find the solutions @xmath134 and @xmath140 .",

    "set @xmath149 and repeat until the opposite neumann boundary has been reached .",
    "the solution time of a single problem can be divided into three parts , the setting up of the problem , the solution of the dirichlet - neumann and its conjugate problem , and the evaluation of the mappings . in short , in the absence of fully automatic mesh generators for this class of problems , the setting up of the problem remains the most time consuming part .",
    "we have implemented the algorithm using mathematica  8 .",
    "the time and memory requirements , in terms of degrees of freedom , have been reported for the dirichlet - neumann problems in @xcite . in the examples below ,",
    "the solution times vary from few seconds to at most two minutes on standard hardware ( as defined in table [ table : countour ] ) .",
