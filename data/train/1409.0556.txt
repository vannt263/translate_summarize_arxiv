    "the holographic correspondence @xcite is a powerful nonperturbative tool that has been widely used to investigate the properties of strongly coupled non - abelian gauge theories with a large number of colors .",
    "in fact , its relevance to the physics of the strongly - coupled quark gluon plasma formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite became evident after the discovery @xcite that strongly coupled ( spatially isotropic ) plasmas that can be described by holographic methods behave as nearly perfect fluids where the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio , @xmath3 , is close to the estimates obtained within relativistic hydrodynamic modeling of heavy ion collisions ( for a recent discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "other applications of the correspondence to the physics of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) have been reviewed in @xcite .",
    "given the recent interest regarding the effects of strong electromagnetic fields in the physics of strong interactions @xcite , it is natural to investigate whether holography can also be as insightful in this case .",
    "for instance , it has been shown in @xcite that in a presence of a magnetic field , @xmath1 , the shear viscosity tensor of strongly coupled @xmath0 sym theory becomes anisotropic and the shear viscosity coefficient in the direction of the magnetic field violates the @xmath4 result @xcite .    motivated by the recent lattice work on the effects of strong external ( abelian ) magnetic fields on the qcd heavy quark potential at zero temperature done in @xcite , in this paper we study the effect of a constant magnetic field on the heavy quark potential in strongly coupled @xmath0 sym theory both at zero and nonzero temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the magnetic field distinguishes the different orientations of the @xmath6 pair axis with respect to direction of the magnetic field ( defined here to be @xmath7 axis ) and , thus , there is now a perpendicular potential , @xmath8 , for which the pair s axis is on the transverse plane @xmath9 and also a parallel potential , @xmath10 , for which the @xmath6 axis coincides with that of the magnetic field .",
    "clearly , other orientations are possible but here we shall focus only on these two cases . also , in this paper we will not solve the schrdinger equation associated with this anisotropic potential ( for recent studies of the effect of magnetic fields on the masses of bound states see , for instance , @xcite ) .    these heavy quark potentials ( both at zero and nonzero temperature ) in the gauge theory are defined in this paper via their corresponding identification involving the appropriate wilson loops @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a rectangular time - like contour of spatial length @xmath13 in the @xmath7 direction and extended over @xmath14 in the time direction while @xmath15 is the corresponding contour of spatial length @xmath16 in the @xmath17 direction sym theory , the wilson loop also contains the coupling to the six @xmath18 adjoint scalars @xmath19 . in this paper",
    "we shall neglect the dynamics of the scalars and the holographic calculation of the wilson loop is defined in 5 dimensions . ] .",
    "we shall follow dhoker and kraus construction of the holographic dual of @xmath0 sym theory in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite and perform the calculations of the loops defined above in the background given by the asymptotic @xmath20 holographic einstein - maxwell model to be reviewed below .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we review the necessary details about the holographic dual of @xmath0 sym theory in the presence of a magnetic field at zero temperature and perform the calculation of the parallel and perpendicular potentials and forces in this case .",

    "in this paper we have studied how the inclusion of a constant magnetic field @xmath1 affects the interaction between heavy @xmath6 pairs in strongly coupled @xmath0 sym theory both at zero and finite temperature by computing rectangular wilson loops using the holographic correspondence .",
    "the magnetic field makes the heavy quark potential and the corresponding force anisotropic and we found that the attraction between the heavy quarks weakens in the presence of the magnetic field ( both at @xmath23 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "although , in practice , in the model considered here this effect only becomes relevant when @xmath77 is extremely large @xcite .",
    "we note that ref .",
    "@xcite studied the anisotropy in the heavy quark potential induced by a nontrivial axion field in the bulk @xcite and found a reduction in the binding energy of the @xmath6 pair .",
    "this result is consistent with ours even though the source of anisotropy used in @xcite is different than the one used here ( the constant magnetic field ) .",
    "this agreement between different anisotropic holographic models has also been found to hold in the case of transport coefficients since the shear viscosity coefficient along the direction of anisotropy computed in the axion - induced model @xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite display the same qualitative behavior .",
    "one may think that results in this paper give support to the idea that in a strongly coupled plasma deconfinement is facilitated by the inclusion of a magnetic field .",
    "however , such a conclusion may only be properly drawn in the case where the underlying gauge theory is not conformal at @xmath23 and @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , the lattice results of ref .",
    "@xcite show that in qcd in a magnetic field at @xmath23 the absolute value of the coulomb coupling in the direction of the magnetic field is enhanced with respect to its vacuum value while this coupling is suppressed in the case perpendicular to the magnetic field . on the other hand , the string tension perpendicular to the field is enhanced with respect to its vacuum value while the string tension parallel to the field is suppressed .",
    "this illustrates how complicated the effects of a magnetic field - induced anisotropy can be in a gauge theory with a mass gap .",
    "it is interesting to see that the relative behavior we found between the perpendicular and parallel potentials in strongly coupled sym qualitatively agrees with the perturbative calculation carried out in @xcite for the coulomb - like part of the quark - antiquark potential in qcd at zero temperature , with the absolute value of the perpendicular potential being suppressed with respect to the potential in the direction of the magnetic field , which in turn is consistent with the behavior found on the lattice @xcite .",
    "however , notice that sym and qcd are very different theories in the vacuum and that , in particular , there is no confinement in sym while in qcd for large quark - antiquark separations the potential becomes linear in the quark - antiquark separation ( in the absence of dynamical quark flavors ) , instead of coulomb - like .",
    "moreover , even for the coulomb - like part of the qcd quark - antiquark potential at zero temperature , the overall behavior is different than what we have found here for the strongly - coupled @xmath0 sym theory .",
    "in fact , in our case both the parallel and perpendicular potentials are enhanced with respect to the isotropic , zero magnetic field case .",
    "also , both the parallel and perpendicular forces between the quark and the antiquark are suppressed with respect to the @xmath2 case .",
    "in fact , if one rewrites the potential as @xmath79 , one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that in the ultraviolet limit @xmath80 the potentials and forces go back to the vacuum result of ref .",
    "however , for finite quark - antiquark separations , the effect of the magnetic field becomes relevant and the suppression observed for the parallel and perpendicular forces with respect to the isotropic , zero magnetic field case may be then related to some type of screening effect due to an effective change in the  coupling constant \" @xmath81 due to the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "it would be interesting to study modifications of the holographic setup addressed here and consider systems that are not conformal at @xmath23 and @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , consider a confining theory at zero temperature and finite magnetic field with confinement scale @xmath82 . in this case , there is already a relevant dimensionless ratio @xmath83 and , for instance , one can study how the mass gap of the theory is affected by the presence of the magnetic field and also how the area law of the rectangular wilson loop becomes anisotropic and can be used to define a string tension for the heavy quark potential that depends on the angle between the @xmath6 pair and the magnetic field direction .",
    "such a model could be easily constructed following the bottom up studies in @xcite this time involving a dynamical metric , a scalar field , and a vector field in the bulk .",
    "the parallel and perpendicular potentials computed in this non - conformal model could be more easily compared to the lattice qcd study of ref .",
    "moreover , since such models are tuned to describe some of the thermodynamical properties of the strongly coupled qcd plasma found on the lattice @xcite , after the inclusion of the magnetic field , one could directly study in these models how the external field affects the deconfinement transition @xcite and also the role played by the paramagnetic behavior of qcd matter @xcite on the determination of other quantities , which also has been studied on the lattice @xcite .",
    "moreover , one could also investigate in such a model how the external field modifies other dynamical observables @xcite that could be relevant to the phenomenology of the qgp formed in heavy ion collisions .",

    "<S> in this work we use the gauge / gravity duality to study the anisotropy in the heavy quark potential in strongly coupled @xmath0 super - yang mills ( sym ) theory ( both at zero and nonzero temperature ) induced by a constant and uniform magnetic field @xmath1 . at zero temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the magnetic field decreases the attractive force between heavy quarks with respect to its @xmath2 value and the force associated with the parallel potential is the least attractive force . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the same occurs at nonzero temperature and , thus , at least in the case of strongly coupled @xmath0 sym , the presence of a magnetic field generally weakens the interaction between heavy quarks in the plasma . </S>"
