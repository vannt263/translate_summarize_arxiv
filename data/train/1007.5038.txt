    "in recent years the connection between the bohr - mottelson ( bm ) collective model @xcite and the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite has been the subject of many studies @xcite .",
    "the bm collective model is built on the assumption that the nucleus is composed by a set of strongly interacting fermions that can be treated as a quantum liquid .",
    "the surface of such a liquid is characterized in terms of the hill - wheeler shape variables @xmath5 @xcite and the euler angles . under this approximation ,",
    "nuclear excitations are small amplitude vibrations and rotations , corrected by the coupling between them @xcite .",
    "the ibm was designed to describe the collective quadrupole degrees of freedom in medium mass and heavy nuclei .",
    "the ibm hamiltonian was written from the beginning in second quantization form in terms of the generators of the u(6 ) algebra , subtended by @xmath6 and @xmath7 bosons which carry angular momenta @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively @xcite .",
    "therefore , the connection between both models is not evident .",
    "an approximated connection comes from considering the ibm as the second quantization of the shape variables @xmath5 @xcite . during the eighties",
    "many studies on the connection between both models were done .",
    "the intrinsic state formalism @xcite was used , but also the complete set of eigenstates @xcite was analyzed through a holstein - primakoff transformation @xcite or by a isometric transformation @xcite .",
    "more recently , the problem of the mapping between both models has been addressed by rowe and collaborators @xcite .",
    "both models presents three special limits that can be solved easily and for which the connection between the models is known .",
    "these three cases are : i ) the bm anharmonic vibrator and the dynamical symmetry u(5 ) ibm limit , ii ) the bm @xmath4-unstable deformed rotor and the dynamical o(6 ) ibm limit , and iii ) the bm axial rotor and the dynamical symmetry o(6 ) ibm limit including @xmath10 interactions @xcite .",
    "note that , although traditionally accepted , the correspondence of the dynamical symmetry su(3 ) ibm limit to a submodel of the bm has never been explicitly probed @xcite .",
    "each of these limits is assigned to a particular shape using the hill - wheeler variables @xmath5 @xcite : spherical , deformed with @xmath4-instability , and axially deformed , respectively . for transitional situations",
    "the correspondence between the two models is difficult and a possible way to establish a mapping between bm and ibm is through numerical studies .    among the transitional hamiltonians , a specially interesting case occurs when it describes a critical point in the transition from a given shape to another . in general , for such a situation , where the structure of the system can change abruptly by applying a small perturbation , both , the bm and the ibm , have to be solved numerically . however , few years ago iachello proposed schematic bohr hamiltonians that intend to describe different critical points and that can be solved exactly in terms of the zeroes of bessel functions .",
    "the first of these models is known as e(5 ) @xcite .",
    "e(5 ) is designed to describe the critical point at the transition from spherical to deformed @xmath4-unstable shapes .",
    "the potential to be used in the differential bohr equation is assumed to be @xmath11independent and , for the @xmath12 degree of freedom an infinite square well is taken .",
    "similar models were proposed later on by iachello , called x(5 ) and y(5 ) @xcite , to describe the critical points between spherical and axially deformed shapes and between axial and triaxial deformed shapes , respectively .",
    "all these models give rise to spectra and electromagnetic transition rates that depend on a couple of free parameters ( including a scale ) . in spite of their simplicity ,",
    "some experimental examples were found @xcite , just after the appearance of these models .    in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on x(5 ) and related models ( the connection between e(5 ) and related models and the ibm was already deeply studied in @xcite ) .",
    "the formulation of x(5 ) attracted immediately attention both experimentally and theoretically . soon after the introduction of the x(5 ) model , the nucleus @xmath13sm was proposed by casten and zamfir @xcite as a realization of it .",
    "other experimental examples proposed are : @xmath14nd , @xmath15gd , @xmath16ce , @xmath17yb , @xmath18hf , @xmath19os , @xmath20ra , and @xmath20th @xcite , although the last two candidates could be better described combining quadrupole and octupole degrees of freedom @xcite . concerning theoretical extensions of x(5 ) , bonatsos and collaborators studied a sequence of potentials of the type @xmath21 , that allows to go from the vibrational limit , @xmath22 , to x(5 ) , @xmath23 @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite spectra and transition rates for the potentials of the type @xmath21 , with @xmath24 , @xmath25 and , @xmath0 , are given explicitly and compared with the original x(5 ) ( infinite square well potential ) case .",
    "other extension of x(5 ) is x(3 ) , which is a rigid version of x(5 ) @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite the authors studied the connection between x(5 ) and a two parameters free ibm calculation . in reference",
    "@xcite the authors compared x(5)-@xmath3 , x(5)-@xmath2 , and x(3 ) also with a restricted two parameter ibm calculation with a number of bosons @xmath26 . in references @xcite the authors treat an exactly separable version of the davidson potential and of the x(5 ) potential , respectively .",
    "finally , in reference @xcite the author studied the effect that the @xmath27 coupling has in solving the bm equation for the x(5 ) potential .",
    "as mentioned above , all these models are produced in the bm scheme and a natural question is to ask for the correspondence of them with the ibm .",
    "is the ibm able to produce the same spectra and transition rates ?",
    "if yes , does the obtained ibm hamiltonian correspond to a critical point ?",
    "this work is intended to answer these questions for the x(5 ) and related models ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and , @xmath31 potentials ) and analyze the convergence as a function of the boson number , @xmath32 .",
    "for that purpose , a large set of x(5 ) and related models results for excitation energies and transition rates are taken as reference for numerical fits of the general ibm hamiltonian .",
    "this procedure will allow to establish the ibm hamiltonian which best fit the different x(5)-@xmath21 models and their relation with the critical points .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec - fit ] the fitting procedure is described and the obtained results are commented .",
    "section [ sec - crit ] is devoted to study the energy surfaces of the fitted ibm hamiltonians and to analyze them in relation to the critical point .",

    "will be kept fixed to the su(3 ) value @xmath45 .    although one could use the most general ibm hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) to describe the x(5)-models a natural question is whether it is possible or not to reduce the number of free parameters . a priori ,",
    "it is not obvious which terms of the hamiltonian can be taken out . to answer this question",
    "one can rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) in terms of casimir operators ( the definitions for the casimir operators have been taken from @xcite ) : @xmath46 +    \\frac{18}{35 } \\kappa_4 \\,\\hat c_2[u(5)]\\\\    & + & \\big(\\kappa_1-\\frac{3}{8}\\kappa_2-\\frac{\\kappa_3}{10}-\\frac{\\kappa_4}{14}\\big)\\,\\hat    c_2[o(3 ) ] + \\frac{\\kappa_2}{2}\\,\\hat c_2[su(3 ) ] + \\big(\\frac{\\kappa_3}{2}-\\frac{3}{14 } \\kappa_4\\big)\\,\\hat c_2[o(5 ) ]    -\\frac{\\kappa_0}{4}\\,\\hat c_2[o(6 ) ] .",
    "\\label{ham - cas}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is expected that for the description of the x(5)-models one will need the contribution of the three ibm dynamical symmetry chains . in the hamiltonian ( [ ham - cas ] )",
    "two contributions come from the u(5 ) algebra , the linear and the quadratic casimir operators .",
    "therefore , it becomes a reasonable `` antsatz '' to remove the u(5 ) quadratic casimir operator .",
    "that implies to fix @xmath47 .",
    "note that its contribution to the rest of casimir operators is absorbed by the rest of the parameters .",
    "but for the x(5)-@xmath0 case.,width=529 ]      in this section we describe the procedure for getting the ibm hamiltonian parameters that best fit the different x(5)-models .",
    "the @xmath48 test is used to perform the fitting .",
    "the @xmath48 function is defined in the standard way , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of data , from a specific x(5)-model , to be fitted , @xmath51 is the number of parameters used in the ibm fit , @xmath52 is an energy level ( or a b(e2 ) value ) taken from a particular x(5)-model , @xmath53 is the corresponding calculated ibm value , and @xmath54 is an arbitrary error assigned to each @xmath52 .    at this point",
    "it is necessary to explain how do we treat the @xmath4 band head in the x(5 ) model .",
    "the position of this band is not determined by the model , therefore an extra parameter should be introduced for determining the gamma band head , specifically the location of the band head @xmath55 state .",
    "consequently , besides the ibm hamiltonian parameters , there is this extra free parameter , @xmath56 , in the fit .",
    "this parameter gives the optimum position of the @xmath4 band in a given x(5)-model for which the best ibm fit is obtained .    in order to perform the fit",
    ", we minimize the @xmath48 function for the energies , using @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , as free parameters of the ibm hamiltonian and @xmath56 as free parameter for the position of the gamma band head . note that besides the qualitative argument presented in section [ sec - model ] to justify the election of @xmath47",
    ", we have extensively explored other possibilities , as for example @xmath62 @xcite . for this election",
    "the improvement in @xmath48 is not worthy and for some particular cases even affects negatively .",
    "in addition , in this case the @xmath48 function is very flat and the correlation that exists between the free parameters generates non physical oscillations in the value of the fitted parameters .",
    "we have also explored the case @xmath63 and @xmath47 , which produces a important increase in the @xmath48 value .",
    "the @xmath47 selection produces a smooth and consistent behavior of the fitted parameters , as can be observed in figures [ fig - par - ener - x5 ] , [ fig - par - ener - x5-b8 ] , [ fig - par - ener - x5-b6 ] , [ fig - par - ener - x5-b4 ] , and [ fig - par - ener - x5-b2 ] .    for doing the fit and the minimization of the @xmath48 function",

    "the different symbols in the figure correspond to the ibm hamiltonians fitted to one of the x(5 ) models ( see legend ) for n ranging from 10 to 70 .",

    "several important features can be extracted from this figure .",
    "the main one is that the x(5 ) case , for the whole range of @xmath32 , is always very close to the maxwell set , _",

    "x(5)-@xmath0 , x(5)-@xmath1 , and x(5)-@xmath2 seat on the coexistence region for small or moderate n values , but they go towards the prolate deformation region as @xmath32 increases , although they are always very close to the antispinodal line . finally , the case x(5)-@xmath3 lies on the deformed region but it approaches to the coexistence area as n increases . in general , one observes that the mapped ibm energy surfaces moves further away from the coexistence region as one changes from x(5 ) through x(5)-@xmath0 , x(5)-@xmath1 , x(5)-@xmath2 , and x(5)-@xmath3 . in general , the higher the value of n is ( x(5)-@xmath107 ) , the closer to the coexistence region is the ibm energy surface . in all the cases",
    "one observes that the different models always move in the direction of the second order phase transition point as n increases .    in order to illustrate graphically the shapes of the energy surfaces obtained with the different ibm hamiltonians , we plot in figure [ fig - ener - r1-r2 ] the axial ibm energy surfaces @xmath108 ( eq .

    "in this paper , we have studied the connection between the x(5)-models and the ibm on the basis of a numerical mapping between these models . to establish the mapping we have performed a best fit of the general ibm hamiltonian to a selected set of energy levels produced by several x(5)-models ; as an additional parameter we have used the energy of the gamma band head , which is not fixed by the x(5)-models .",
    "later on , a free parameter check of the wave functions , obtained with the best fit parameters , has been done by calculating relevant b(e2 ) transition rates .",
    "all calculations have been done as a function of the number of bosons .",
    "once the best fit ibm hamiltonians to the different x(5)-models are obtained , their energy surfaces are constructed and analyzed with the help of the catastrophe theory so as to know how close they are to a critical point .    we have shown that it is possible , in all cases , to obtain a mapping between the x(5)-models and the ibm with a reasonable agreement for both energies and b(e2 ) transition rates . in general , the goodness of the fit to the energies and b(e2 ) transition rates is independent on the number of bosons .",
    "globally , the agreement is similar for all the models : for the energies the best agreement is for x(5)-@xmath0 and x(5)-@xmath1 while the worst is for x(5 ) .",
    "anyway , the @xmath48 values obtained that give the goodness of the fits are comparable for all the models .",
    "additional tests have been done to the produced wave functions by calculating b(e2 ) transition rates .",
    "no free parameters are included in these calculations . in this case , the best agreement ( smallest @xmath48 value ) is obtained for x(5 ) while the worst is for x(5)-@xmath3 .",
    "a consequence of this good general agreement is that it would be almost impossible , from an experimental point of view , to discriminate between a x(5)-model and its corresponding ibm hamiltonian when only few low - lying states are considered ( usually the four lowest states in the ground , beta , and gamma bands . )",
    "we have also proved that the x(5 ) model corresponds to an ibm hamiltonian which is very close to the first order phase transition region , getting closer for larger values of @xmath32 .",
    "x(5)-@xmath0 , x(5)-@xmath1 , and x(5)-@xmath2 models seat on the coexistence region for small and moderate values of @xmath32 , but they slightly move into the deformed region for the larger values of @xmath32",
    ". finally x(5)-@xmath3 stands all the way in the deformed region , although very close to the coexistence region . in all the cases the system evolves towards the second order critical point as n increases .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the conclusions raised in this work are somehow dependent on the constrains imposed in the fitting procedure .",
    "on one hand we have checked that the inclusion , or not , of high lying states in the bands considered in the fit does not strongly affect to the results . on the other hand",
    "we have extensively checked the case with @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "this later case generates values of @xmath48 similar to the ones presented in this work , but the global picture of the mapped ibm hamiltonians to the x(5)-models is not so consistent as one the shown here .",
    "in particular , the change of the hamiltonian parameters as a function of n or as a function of the considered x(5)-model is not smooth enough .",
    "there are instabilities in the fitting procedure due to the fact that the produced @xmath48 surface is very flat .    finally , it is worth mentioning the differences between the x(5)-models / ibm and the e(5)-models / ibm mapping @xcite . for the e(5)-models the agreement for both ,",
    "the energies and the b(e2 ) transition rates is really remarkable and much better than for the x(5)-models .",
    "globally , the best agreement is obtained for the e(5)-@xmath2 hamiltonian and the worst for the e(5 ) case . for the case of very large number of bosons the only e(5)-model that can be reproduced exactly by the ibm is e(5)-@xmath2 , corresponding such a hamiltonian with the critical point of the model ( @xmath100 ) ( as shown in @xcite ) .",
    "all the e(5)-models correspond to ibm hamiltonians very close to the critical area , @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , one can say that the e(5)-models are appropriate to describe transitional @xmath11unstable regions close to the critical point .",
    "however , not all the x(5)-models are suitable for describing the critical area between the axially deformed and the spherical shapes , only x(5 ) is really appropriated to this end .",
    "finally , for the e(5)-models it is observed the existence of something similar to a quasidynamical symmetry @xcite , we call this phenomenon quasi - critical point symmetry . in the case of the x(5)-models we can not talk about quasi - critical point symmetry because the agreement between ibm and the x(5)-models is not good enough , only in the case of the ground state band for x(5 )",
    "we have the appropriated agreement to say that a quasi - critical point symmetry is present .",
