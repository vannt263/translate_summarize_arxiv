    "the prospect of observing large fluctuations of parity - odd observables in heavy ion collisions has recently gained great attention due to measurements by the star collaboration at the rhic ( the relativistic heavy ion collider ) @xcite .",

    "the magnetic field lines , which have @xmath2 in qcd , can be randomly parallel or anti - parallel to the electric field lines .",
    "however , since each flux tube might be responsible for dozens of particles , there might exist the opportunity to view these fluctuations .",
    "observation of such fluctuations would validate the existence of coherent color magnetic flux , which is a basic feature of a non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "the experimental manifestation of fluctuations comes from the parity - odd value of @xmath3 , which is randomly positive or negative within a given tube . via anomalous chiral couplings , these fields couple to the electromagnetic field @xmath4 . in the participant region of a heavy ion collision , where there exists a strong coherent transverse magnetic field",
    "@xmath5 due to the passing ions , one can then generate a non - zero electric field due to the coupling with the color fields .",
    "this electric field is then randomly parallel or anti - parallel to the electric field , and should last a few tenths of a fm/@xmath1 .",
    "since each flux tube generates an electric field with random signs , the averaged electric field fluctuates as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of such tubes .",
    "angular correlations might then scale as @xmath8 .",
    "since there are fewer tubes than particles , one might hope that this fluctuation stands out compared to random fluctuations .",
    "the size of the correlations observed by star is of the order of @xmath9 to @xmath10 , and given that these typically have multiplicities , @xmath11 , of a few hundred particles at mid - rapidity , the correlations are smaller than @xmath12 and much smaller than @xmath8 , so one can not neglect correlations that involve a handful of particles , such as charge or momentum conservation .",

    "this results in a correlation between positive and negative particles , i.e. , for every positive particle emitted at an angle @xmath29 , there tends to be a negative particle emitted with @xmath30 and with similar rapidity .",
    "charge balance functions @xcite represent a measure of such correlations , and have already been measured as a function of relative rapidity for identified particles and for relative pseudo - rapidity @xmath31 for non - identified particles .",

    "the separation of the balancing charges is consistent with the charges being emitted from regions with the same collective rapidity , with the separation being solely driven by the final thermal motion of the decoupling source .",
    "this spread tends to be of the order of a half unit of rapidity .",
    "similarly , one would expect that any charged particle would be accompanied by a balancing charge with a similar relative angle .",
    "the degree of correlation can be quantified by @xmath35 , which would be unity if the balancing charge was always emitted exactly along the same direction , and would be zero if the balancing charge were to be emitted randomly .",
    "such preliminary correlations have been presented by star @xcite , and show that the balancing charge tends to be emitted in within a few tens of degrees of its companion in central collisions .",
    "as expected , the correlations are significantly broader in relative angle for peripheral collisions .    for the case of correlations to be considered here , @xmath36 where it has been assumed that only one charge @xmath37 balances the charge @xmath38 and that its relative angle @xmath39 . here",

    "this suggests that @xmath54 would be negative , which would also give a positive contribution to @xmath26 in eq .",

    "( [ eq : gamma_chargeconservation_general ] ) should dominate the other two terms .",
    "the fraction @xmath40 can be related to the normalization of the charge balance function , which is near 0.5 in star measurements .",
    "about half of the reduction comes from the fact that some particles within the @xmath57 unit of rapidities covered by star are not recorded due to finite efficiency or for having too low of a transverse momentum @xmath58 .",
    "the other half of the reduction comes from the balancing charge lying outside the rapidity range of the detector . for a particle with rapidity of zero",
    ", the balancing charge tends to be largely inside the acceptance , while for a particle emitted barely within the rapidity acceptance , the balancing charge has a 50% chance of being outside .",
    "thus , overall the contribution from @xmath40 due to the balancing charge being outside the acceptance is about 0.75 . if one were to use the efficiency and acceptance corrected values of the multiplicity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_chargeconservation ] ) , rather than the number @xmath11 of charges actually recorded , the fraction @xmath40 one would use should be on the order of 0.75 .",
    "given that collective flow accounts for about half of the final motion of the particles , one might expect @xmath59 . for very peripheral collisions , one would expect a smaller value . if the charge balance function were measured fully as a function of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , all of the quantities on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_chargeconservation ] ) can be extracted from experimental analyses .",
    "ignoring charge conservation for the moment , the implications of momentum conservation are best understood by considering the correlation calculated independently of the charge of the particle . in that case , @xmath62 where @xmath38 and @xmath37 are summed over both charged and neutral particles , i.e , from 1 to @xmath63 .",
    "momentum conservation implies , @xmath64 the effects of momentum conservation would be mostly model - independent if the definition of @xmath65 was defined in terms of @xmath66 instead of the angles alone .",
    "instead , we will make a simplifying assumption that all particles have the same @xmath58 .",

    "experimentally , the same - sign is defined as the average of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and assuming that the momentum balance is shared equally amongst the charges @xmath77    as stated above , this result was predicated on the assumption that all particles had the same @xmath58 . to remove this model dependence",
    ", one could consider the same quantity weighted with the transverse momenta of the particles , @xmath78 with the sums covering all charged particles . in that case , one comes up with the same answer as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_momentumconservation ] ) , but without the model dependence , and with @xmath79 being weighted with @xmath80 , @xmath81    in practice , only a subset of particles are measured . in that case",
    "some of the momentum balance comes from unmeasured particles and one might expect @xmath82 . in the star experiment at rhic for which these correlations were measured , tracks were measured for the central two units of rapidity .",
    "however , the initial colliding beams approached with @xmath83 units of rapidity with over half of the tracks emerging with rapidities outside the star acceptance",
    ". these particles can serve as a source of momentum , which can quench the momentum conservation condition , thus reduce the magnitude of @xmath27",
    ". however , the transverse momentum of a given track is more likely to be balanced by neighboring particles , which have similar rapidities .",
    "this is particularly true when considering the components of the momenta responsible for elliptic flow .",
    "for instance , consider a particle with final momentum transverse momentum @xmath84 .",
    "some of that momentum is generated by the passing nuclei , which impart a momentum @xmath85 which is balanced by particles well outside the acceptance .",
    "a second component of the momentum @xmath86 comes from interactions with neighbors with similar rapidity . for the track @xmath38 , @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "since the momenta @xmath85 are generated at very early times , before particles can gain awareness of the elliptic anisotropy of the collision region , the vectors @xmath89 are isotropically distributed in the @xmath90 plane .",
    "when one calculates the correlation , @xmath91 and given that the vectors @xmath85 are isotropic and uncorrelated , @xmath92 applying momentum conservation , @xmath88 , @xmath93 similarly , one can calculate @xmath71 with the same decomposition and find , @xmath94 using the isotropy of @xmath85 to eliminate the first term in the first line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : v2deriv ] ) . by inspection of the last two expressions ,",
    "one again finds @xmath95 thus , since elliptic flow is expected to be generated from local interactions , one expects the damping of elliptic flow from finite acceptance to be due to edge effects . if momentum conservation is confined to within a half unit of rapidity , the damping might be a few tens of percent at most for a large acceptance experiment like star .    if one were to explore an observable without the @xmath96 weight",
    ", one would again have the negative contribution from momentum conservation , but it would be more strongly damped by the conservation being spread out over a much greater rapidity range .",
    "furthermore , such an observable is significantly affected by jets or hot spots which make positive contributions to the correlations .",
    "such observables are studied under the moniker of @xmath58 fluctuations .    the contribution from charge correlation",
    "was ignored in the expression above for @xmath97 , as if the two sources of correlation could be treated independently . however , this is not the case . for a charged particle observed with momentum @xmath98 ,",
    "one expects a particle of similar momentum but opposite charge .",
    "the same - sign correlation explicitly ignores the contribution of this balancing particle , but its momentum nonetheless needs to be balanced , and since the momentum balance was assumed to be spread equally amongst all charges , it magnifies @xmath97 .",
    "the momentum that must be balanced is increased by the factor @xmath99 .",
    "this gives the final estimate for the same - sign angular correlation , @xmath100 where the factor of @xmath101 came from assuming the charged multiplicity is two thirds the total multiplicity , @xmath102 . the same enhancement factor should also be applied to the expression for the @xmath58 weighted correlation , @xmath103",
    "the first source of correlation we consider derives from the electric field of the incoming nuclei , which can contribute to charge separation , i.e. , @xmath28 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : paritycartoon ] , the magnetic field lines in the participant region combine constructively , whereas the electric field lines from the two nuclei would average to zero in the participant region .",
    "however , the location of the participants within that volume fluctuates given the random nature of the nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "once the center - of - mass of the initial collisions strays from the center ( @xmath104 ) the averaged electric field is no longer zero .",
    "the highly lorentz - contracted fields from the spectators impart an impulse @xmath105 to charged particles in the participant region . due to the contraction the field decays within a few tenths of a fm/@xmath1 , so only the charge from the initial state",
    "is affected . for",
    "the purposes of making a crude estimate here , we label that fraction @xmath106 , and note that it might be at most a few tens of percent .",
    "the impulse such a charge @xmath38 feels from a highly relativistic particle @xmath37 is @xmath107 to estimate the effect , we considered spectators and participants to be randomly positioned in spheres of 7 fm radius , then using a 35 mb cross section considered the net impulse imparted onto positive charges located according to the collision points from all the protons in the initial beams , which were assumed to move along straight - line trajectories .",
    "the rms @xmath105 for a charge in the participant region was @xmath108 2.5 mev/@xmath1 for central collisions and rose to @xmath108 5 mev/@xmath1 for very peripheral collisions .",
    "the induced @xmath109 for particles of a given charge , given the original distribution of @xmath48 was random , is @xmath110 the contribution to the angular correlations is then , @xmath111 since @xmath105 is less than one percent of the mean @xmath58 , this effect comes out on the order of @xmath112 , which is significantly smaller than the charge- and momentum - conservation effects described in the previous sections . however , for the most central collisions , where the conservation induced effects become very small , there would appear to be a chance that these effects could contribute .    although rather small , the expression above still significantly over - estimates the effect .",
    "this is because the initial impulse will be reduced when the initial momenta are absorbed and thermalized by the medium . assuming the particles move for a time @xmath113 before being absorbed",
    ", the charge separation in momentum space translates into a small dipole moment in the thermalized fireball .",
    "one can estimate the dipole moment by calculating how far the particles move before @xmath113 , which might be a few tenths of a fm/@xmath1 .",
    "once that dipole moment is super - imposed onto a simple blast - wave picture of the final state , it again translates into a momentum anisotropy , but tends the value for @xmath109 tends to be lower by a factor @xmath114 than the expression above , where @xmath115 is the collective velocity at the edge of the fireball ( @xmath116 ) , @xmath117 is the decoupling temperature , and @xmath118 is the initial size of the overlap region .",
    "this effectively reduces the effect by an order of magnitude .",
    "however , for higher @xmath58 particles , one might expect the particles to avoid thermalization .",
    "furthermore , for higher @xmath58 the fraction @xmath106 might be higher .",
    "thus , it might be expected that a modest , at best , contribution from this effect might survive for higher @xmath58 .",
    "the contribution from fluctuating initial conditions should behave very similarly to the effect from parity fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuating initial conditions lead to electric fields which are on the order of 10% of the magnetic fields .",
    "it is more difficult to estimate the degree to which electric fields are generated by the anomalous coupling to the qcd fields and the magnetic field . given that the coupling involves extra powers of both the qcd and electromagnetic coupling constants , the generated electric fields might well be smaller than those considered here .",
    "if such is the case , the effect of parity fluctuations would be far too small for observation .",
    "the most direct way to distinguish between the contributions from charge- and momentum- conservation from contributions from fluctuating initial conditions , or equivalently from parity fluctuations , would be to consider the rapidity range over which the correlations extend .",
    "for the conservation effects , the correlation should be confined to approximately on unit of relative rapidity , whereas the effect of fluctuation initial conditions should extend several units of rapidity .",
    "in addition to the charge separation due to the coulomb force , one might also consider forces from the nuclear mean field , which due to the difference in the proton and neutron number would also be non - zero .",
    "although the coupling constant for nuclear forces is larger by two orders of magnitude , the force is short range and only involves a few neighbors .",
    "the net result is difficult to predict , but might have a stronger impact than the electric force considered here .",
    "again , the correlation might extend several units of rapidity , but the magnitude of the effect would scale differently with the centrality",
    ".    a final source of correlation has to do with the two - particle correlation induced by final - state interactions .",
    "these correlations are driven by identical - particle interference , mutual coulomb attraction or repulsion , or strong interactions between the particles .",
    "strong interactions mainly contribute through resonant interactions , and thus mainly affect opposite sign correlations .",
    "however , these contributions are already included as part of the charge balance functions .",
    "a decaying neutral particle contributes to the charge balance function by having the balancing charge located in a narrow range of invariant relative momentum , which , depending on the invariant mass , might either broaden or narrow the charge balance function , but not change the overall normalization .",
    "similarly , coulomb interactions pull positives and negatives toward one another in momentum space , while pushing the positives and negatives further apart .",
    "again , these forces do not change the normalization of the balance function , but can affect the width , leading to a larger value of @xmath56 .",
    "identical particle statistics are mainly important for pions due to their larger phase space density .",
    "this draws same - sign pairs together in momentum space .",
    "again , such correlations can not change the fact that electric charge is locally conserved , so the normalization of the balance function is unaffected .",
    "since the integrated strength of identical particle correlations is the average phase space - density , which averages to less than 10% over the acceptance , this implies that less than 10% of the strength of the balance function is pushed away from very small relative angle to larger relative angles , which might reduce @xmath56 by a few percent .",
    "it appears there are few effects that could modify the difference , @xmath28 . from the considerations in this section",
    ", it would seem that the combination @xmath28 should be dominated by charge conservation effects as described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_chargeconservation ] ) , since competing effects would appear to be much smaller .",
    "thus , this expression should be trustworthy to within the 10 - 20% level .",
    "it is easier to imagine effects that would contribute to @xmath27 besides momentum conservation .",
    "the effects of jets being quenched differently between in - plane and out - of - plane is difficult to assess .",
    "here , we replot the correlations measured by star in a way that better emphasizes how they might compare to correlations induced by momentum and charge conservation .",
    "the correlations @xmath28 and @xmath27 are each presented in fig .",

    "[ fig : results ] .",
    "the multiplicity @xmath11 was taken by assuming that the detector covered 2 units of pseudo - rapidity with the multiplicity being equal to 1.85 times the number of participants .",
    "the factor 1.85 comes from a phobos analysis that showed the multiplicity scaling with the number of participants to the 10% level @xcite .",
    "the number of participants depends on the centrality and its extraction is modestly model dependent .",

    "the correlations sensitive to charge correlation , @xmath120 , are shown by red circles . if the angular width of the balance function is narrowly peaked , and if an observed particle has a high probability of having its charge - balancing partner fall within the rapidity range of the detector , the scaled correlation should be @xmath121 unity as shown in eq .",

    "the fraction @xmath40 of balancing charge found within the 2 units of rapidity covered by star can in principle be determined from balance function analyses .",
    "these analyses showed that the integrated strength of the balance function describes the chance of finding a balancing charge .",
    "this probability tended to be in the neighborhood of 0.5 for non - identified particles .",
    "however , some of this reduction was due to the non - ideal efficiency of the detector or the @xmath58 cutoffs .",
    "since the quantity @xmath11 used to scale the correlations was corrected for efficiency and for @xmath58 cutoffs , the fraction @xmath40 should only refer to the fraction of balance charge that lay outside the rapidity acceptance of star , roughly @xmath57 units .",

    "balance functions from star in term of the relative azimuthal angle have appeared in preliminary form and it appears that the widths have @xmath56 are near 0.5 within a few tens of percent . combining with an estimate of @xmath40 , it would not be surprising if the first term , @xmath125 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaled ] ) is approximately 1/3 , which would explain a bit more than half of the observed correlation in fig .",

    "one does expect @xmath127 to be positive and @xmath126 to be negative , hence , they should help push the right - hand side toward the data , but with an unknown amount .",
    "thus , one can only conclude that the majority of the correlation @xmath28 seems to derive from combining charge conservation with elliptic flow , but the possibility remains that this source could fall short of the total observed correlation by a few tens of percent .",
    "if the measurement of @xmath28 turns out to be too large to be described by folding local charge conservation with elliptic flow , it would demand considering other sources of correlation . as shown in sec .",

    "the same considerations apply to electric fields generated by coupling to parity fluctuations in the qcd sector .",
    "if the generated electric fields are 10% of the magnetic field strength , the imparted momenta are also on the order of 5 mev/@xmath1 .",
    "again , the considerations of having only a fraction of charge affected , and of having particles re - thermalized , would make such a signal far too small .",
    "thus , if coupling electro - magnetic and qcd fields through the anomalous coupling is to account for a significant fraction of the observed correlation , the generated electric field would have to be nearly as strong as the driving magnetic field .",

    "in fact , the relation for @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaled ] ) is more a consistency check than a test of charge conservation .",
    "the most telling way to distinguish correlations is to view the correlations in the most differential form possible , given the limited statistics .",
    "for instance , the balance function can be evaluated in terms of the two angles , @xmath128 this observable can be thought of as the conditional distribution for seeing an extra particle of opposite sign at @xmath129 , given the observation of a first particle at @xmath130 , and integrating over @xmath129 should yield unity for perfect acceptance and efficiency ( also assuming equal numbers of positives and negatives ) .",

    "preliminary charge balance functions have not shown such a peak for @xmath133 , but analyses have not yet been performed where @xmath130 is constrained to be near @xmath134 .",
    "furthermore , one can help discriminate sources of correlation by binning according to relative rapidity .",
    "if the source of the correlation is charge conservation plus elliptic flow , the peak should be confined in relative rapidity to one unit , the width of the measured balance function in relative rapidity .",

    "[ sec : other ] , to extend over a wide range of rapidity .",
    "assuming that the direction of the color magnetic flux also extends over the entirety of a flux tube , one would also expect parity fluctuation induced correlations to also extend well beyond one unit of rapidity .",

    "the fraction @xmath69 describes the fraction of the momentum responsible for @xmath71 that falls within the same rapidity range must be less than unity , and if the rapidity range is dominated by final thermal motion , one might expect , within a few tens of percent , @xmath135 .",

    "[ sec : momentumconservation ] , evaluating the @xmath58 weighted correlation as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammaprime ] ) should reduce the model dependence and give a better feel for how much of the observed correlation comes from momentum conservation combined with elliptic flow .",
    "it is possible that other sources of correlation are responsible for a significant fraction of the signal .",
    "for example , the quenching of jets , or mini - jets , might have a reaction - plane dependence .",
    "if the same - sign correlation is indeed largely driven by momentum conservation combined with anisotropic flow , this correlation might provide important insight into dynamics and perhaps even bulk properties of the matter .",
    "gavin has proposed using @xmath58 correlations binned by relative rapidity as a means to gain insight into viscosity or heat conductivity @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to understand the degree to which jets interfere with such interpretations , as even soft - sector particles may have originated from quenched jets or mini - jets .",
    "in contrast , the quantity @xmath137 is only sensitive to the part of the momentum correlations that contribute to the elliptic anisotropy .",
    "thus , if @xmath138 were analyzed as a function of the relative rapidity , one might gain a more robust insight into transport coefficients .    returning to the motivating suggestion that parity fluctuations drive these observables",
    ", it now seems that the bulk of the observed correlation @xmath28 can be explained by the combined effects of local charge conservation and elliptic flow . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_chargeconservation_general ] ) would seem to explain half or more of the contribution , and after accounting for the additional terms , this has the potential to explain nearly all the signal . further analysis of charge balance functions should show the degree to which the three terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_chargeconservation_general ] ) contribute individually to the effect .",
    "the same - sign correlation , which by itself does not promote the idea of parity fluctuations , might be similarly explained by momentum conservation coupled to elliptic flow .",
    "however , until @xmath58 weighted correlations are constructed , more quantitative conclusions are unwarranted .    fluctuating initial conditions combined with the electric fields of the spectator nuclei in the previous section also provide correlations of the same sign as those observed .",
    "these effects have much in common with the effect one would expect from parity fluctuations .",
    "the correlations would extend multiple units of rapidity and would affect opposite - sign and same - sign correlations in the opposite direction .",
    "however , the estimates of the previous section suggest that such contributions might are too small to be observable , even though the effective electric fields were of the order of 10% of the strength of the magnetic fields",
    ". given that the electric field generated from the magnetic field coupling to parity - odd term in the qcd fields might easily be less than 10% of the magnetic field , this underscores that explaining the observed correlations through parity fluctuations would require surprisingly large couplings of the parity odd @xmath4 terms in the qcd and electromagnetic sectors .",
