    "the susceptibility @xmath8 of the square lattice ising model has been shown by wu , mccoy , tracy and barouch  @xcite to be expressible as an infinite sum of holomorphic functions , given as multiple integrals , denoted @xmath9 , that is @xmath10 .",
    "b. nickel found  @xcite that each of these @xmath9 s is actually singular on a set of points located on the unit circle @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the usual ising model temperature variable .",
    "these singularities are located at solution points of the following equations : @xmath13 from now on , we will call these singularities of the `` nickelian type '' , or simply `` nickelian singularities '' .",
    "the accumulation of this infinite set of singularities of the higher - particle components of @xmath14 on the unit circle @xmath15 , leads , in the absence of mutual cancellation , to some consequences regarding the non holonomic ( non d - finite ) character of the susceptibility , possibly building a natural boundary for the total @xmath16 .",
    "however , it should be noted that new singularities that are not of the `` nickelian type '' were discovered as singularities of the fuchsian linear differential equation associated  @xcite with @xmath17 and as singularities of @xmath17 _ itself _",
    "@xcite but seen as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "they correspond to the quadratic polynomial @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast with this situation , the fuchsian linear differential equation , associated  @xcite with @xmath21 , does not provide any new singularities .",
    "some remarkable russian - doll structure as well as direct sum decompositions were found for the corresponding linear differential operators for @xmath7 and @xmath21 . in order to understand the `` true nature '' of the susceptibility of the square lattice ising model , it is of fundamental importance to have a better understanding of the singularity structure of the @xmath22-particle contributions @xmath1 , and also of the mathematical structures associated with these @xmath9 , namely the _ infinite set _ of ( probably fuchsian ) linear differential equations associated with this infinite set of holonomic functions .",
    "finding more fuchsian linear differential equations having the @xmath1 s as solutions , beyond those already found  @xcite for @xmath7 and @xmath21 , probably requires the performance of a large set of analytical , mathematical and computer programming `` tours - de - force '' .    as an alternative , and in order to bypass this `` temporary '' obstruction , we have developed , in parallel , a new strategy .",
    "we have introduced  @xcite some single ( or multiple ) `` model '' integrals as an `` ersatz '' for the @xmath9 s as far as the locus of the singularities is concerned .",
    "the @xmath9 s are defined by @xmath23-dimensional integrals  @xcite ( omitting the prefactor ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath27    the two families of integrals we have considered in  @xcite are very rough approximations of the integrals ( [ chi3tild ] ) .",
    "for the first family , we considered the @xmath0-fold integrals corresponding to the product of ( the square of the ) @xmath28 s , integrated over the whole domain of integration of the @xmath29 ( thus getting rid of the factors @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) . here , we found a subset of singularities occurring in the @xmath1 as well as the quadratic polynomial condition @xmath32 .",
    "for the second family , we discarded the factor @xmath30 and the product of @xmath33 s , and we restricted the domain of integration to the principal diagonal of the angles @xmath29 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "these simple integrals ( over a _ single _ variable ) , were denoted  @xcite @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is given by ( [ thex ] ) .    remarkably these very simple integrals",
    "both _ reproduce all the singularities _",
    ", discussed by nickel  @xcite , as well as the quadratic roots of @xmath38 found  @xcite for the linear ode of @xmath7 .",
    "one should however note that , in contrast with the @xmath9 , no russian - doll or direct sum decomposition structure is found for the linear differential operators corresponding to these @xmath39 .",
    "another approach has been introduced as a simplification of the susceptibility of the ising model by considering a magnetic field restricted to one diagonal of the square lattice  @xcite . for this `` diagonal susceptibility ''",
    "model  @xcite , we benefited from the _ form factor decomposition _ of the diagonal two - point correlations @xmath40 , that has been recently presented  @xcite , and subsequently proved by lyberg and mccoy  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0-fold integrals @xmath41 were found to exhibit remarkable direct sum structures inherited from the direct sum structures of the form factor  @xcite .",
    "the linear differential operators of the form factor  @xcite being closely linked to the second order differential operator @xmath42 ( resp .",
    "@xmath43 ) of the complete elliptic integrals @xmath44 ( resp .",
    "@xmath45 ) , this `` diagonal susceptibility '' model  @xcite is closely linked to the elliptic curves of the two - dimensional ising model . by way of contrast , we note that the singularities of the linear ode s for these @xmath0-fold integrals  @xcite @xmath41 are quite elementary ( consisting of only @xmath22-th roots of unity ) in comparison with the singularities we encounter for the integrals on a single variable ( [ chinaked ] ) .",
    "these two approaches corresponding to two different sets of @xmath0-fold integrals of the ising class  @xcite are complementary : ( [ chinaked ] ) is more dedicated to reproduce the non - trivial head polynomials encoding the location of the singularities of the @xmath9 , but fails to reproduce some remarkable ( russian - doll , direct sum decomposition ) algebraico - differential structures of the corresponding linear differential operators , while the other one  @xcite preserves these non - trivial structures of the corresponding linear differential operators but provides a poorer representation of the location of the singularities ( @xmath22-th roots of unity ) .",
    ".1 cm    in this paper , we return to the integrals ( [ chi3tild ] ) where , this time , the natural next step is to consider the following family of @xmath0-fold integrals @xmath46 which amounts to getting rid of the ( fermionic ) factor @xmath47 in the @xmath0-fold integral ( [ chi3tild ] ) .",
    "this family is as close as possible to ( [ chi3tild ] ) , for which we know that finding the corresponding linear differential ode s is a huge task .",
    "the idea here is that the methods and techniques we have developed  @xcite for series expansions calculations of @xmath7 and @xmath21 , seem to indicate that the quite involved fermionic term @xmath47 in the integrand of ( [ chi3tild ] ) should not impact greatly on the location of singularities of these @xmath0-fold integrals ( [ chi3tild ] ) .",
    "this is the best simplification of the integrand of ( [ chi3tild ] ) for which we can expect to retain much exact information about the location of the singularities of the original ising problem .",
    "however , we certainly do not expect to recover from the @xmath0-fold integrals ( [ in ] ) the local singular behavior ( exponents , amplitudes of singularities , etc ... ) .",
    "getting rid of the ( fermionic ) factor @xmath47 are we moving away from the elliptic curves of the two - dimensional ising model ?",
    "could it be possible that we lose the strong ( russian - doll , direct sum decomposition ) algebraico - differential structures of the corresponding linear differential operators inherited from the second order differential operator @xmath42 ( resp .",
    "@xmath43 ) of the complete elliptic integrals @xmath44 ( resp .",
    "@xmath45 ) but keep some characterization of elliptic curves through more `` primitive '' ( universal ) features of these @xmath0-fold integral like the location of their singularities ?    in the sequel , we give the expressions of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and the fuchsian linear differential equations for @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the computation ( linear ode search of a series ) becomes much harder .",
    "consequently we use a _ modulo prime _ method to obtain the form of the corresponding linear ode with totally explicit singularity structure .",
    "these results provide a large set of `` candidate singularities '' for the @xmath9 . from the resolution of the landau conditions  @xcite for ( [ in ] ) , we show that the singularities of ( the linear odes of ) these multiple integrals actually reduce to the concatanation of the singularities of ( the linear odes of ) a set of one - dimensional integrals .",
    "we discuss the _ mathematical , as well as physical , interpretation _ of these new singularities",
    ". in particular we will see that they correspond to _ pinched landau - like singularities _ as previously noticed by nickel  @xcite .",
    "among all these polynomial singularities , the quadratic numbers @xmath54 are highly selected .",
    "we will show that these selected quadratic numbers are related to _",
    "complex multiplication for the elliptic curves _ parameterizing the square ising model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ( [ singode ] ) presents the multidimensional integrals @xmath55 and the singularities of the corresponding linear ode for @xmath56 , that we compare with the singularities obtained from the landau conditions .",
    "we show that the set of singularities associated with the odes of the multiple integrals @xmath57 reduce to the singularities of the odes associated with a _ finite number of one - dimensional integrals_. section ( [ bridge ] ) deals with the _ complex multiplication for the elliptic curves _ related to the singularities given by the zeros of the quadratic polynomial @xmath58 .",
    "our conclusions are given in section ( [ conclu ] ) .",
    "for the first two values of @xmath22 , one obtains @xmath59 and @xmath60    for @xmath61 , the series coefficients of the multiple integrals @xmath55 are obtained by expanding in the variables @xmath62 and performing the integration ( see [ a0 ] ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a @xmath65 hypergeometric series dependent on @xmath66 .",
    "the advantage of using these simplified integrals ( [ in ] ) instead of the original ones ( [ chi3tild ] ) is twofold .",
    "using ( [ integratedsum ] ) the series generation is straightforward compared to the complexity related to the @xmath1 . as an illustration note",
    "that on a desk computer , @xmath50 are generated up to @xmath67 in less than 10 seconds cpu time for all values of @xmath0 , while the simplest case of the @xmath68 , namely @xmath69 , tooks three minutes to generate the series up to @xmath67 .",
    "this difference between the @xmath50 and @xmath68 increases rapidly with increasing @xmath0 and increasing number of generated terms .",
    "we note that for the @xmath50 quantities and for a fixed order , the cpu time is decreasing with increasing @xmath0 . for @xmath68",
    "the opposite is the case .",
    "the second point is that , for a given @xmath22 , the linear ode can be found with less terms in the series compared to the linear ode for the @xmath1 . indeed for @xmath17 , 360 terms were needed while 150 terms were enough for @xmath70 .",
    "the same feature holds for @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( 185 terms for @xmath71 and 56 terms for @xmath72 ) .    with the fully integrated sum ( [ integratedsum ] ) ,",
    "a sufficient number of terms is generated to obtain the linear differential equations .",
    "we succeeded in obtaining the linear differential equations , respectively of minimal order five and six , corresponding to @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "these linear ode s are given in [ a ] .",
    "for @xmath55 ( @xmath75 ) , the calculations , in order to get the linear odes become really huge .",
    "for this reason , we introduce a modular strategy which amounts to generating large series _",
    "modulo a prime _ and then deducing the ode modulo that prime . note that the ode of minimal order is _ not necessarily the simplest one _ as far as the required number of terms in the series expansion to find the linear ode is concerned .",
    "we have already encountered such a situation  @xcite . for @xmath76 ( resp .",
    "@xmath77 ) , the linear ode of minimal order is of order 17 ( resp .",
    "27 ) and needs 8471 ( resp .",
    "9272 ) terms in the series expansion to be found .    actually , for @xmath76 ( resp .",
    "@xmath77 ) , we have found the corresponding linear odes of order 28 ( resp .",
    "42 ) with _ only _ 2208 ( resp .",
    "1838 ) terms from which we have deduced the minimal ones .",
    "the form of these two minimal order linear odes obtained modulo primes is sketched in [ a ] . in particular , the singularities",
    "( given by the roots of the head polynomial in front of the highest order derivative ) , are given with the corresponding multiplicity in [ a ] .",
    "some details about the ode search are also given in [ a ] .",
    "we have also obtained very long series ( 20000 coefficients ) modulo primes for @xmath78 , but , unfortunately , this has not been sufficient to identify the linear ode ( mod .",
    "prime ) up to order 100 .",
    "the singularities of the linear ode for the first @xmath55 are respectively zeros of the following polynomials ( besides @xmath79 ) : @xmath80    for @xmath81 and @xmath82 , besides modulo primes series calculations described above , we also generated very large series from which we obtained in floating point form , the polynomials given in [ singphi7phi8 ] ( using generalised differential pad methods ) .    if we compare the singularities for @xmath50 to those obtained with the `` diagonal model '' presented in  @xcite , i.e. @xmath83 , one sees that the singularities of the linear ode for the `` diagonal model '' are identical to those of the linear ode of the @xmath50 for @xmath84 ( and are a proper subset to those of @xmath50 for @xmath85 ) .",
    "the additional singularities for @xmath86 are zeros of the polynomials : @xmath87 for @xmath88 , the zeros of the following polynomials ( among others ) are singularities which are not of nickel s type ( [ sols ] ) and do not occur for @xmath83 : @xmath89    the linear odes of the multiple integrals @xmath50 thus display _ additional singularities _ for @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 see below ) compared to the linear ode of the single integrals @xmath93 .",
    "we found it remarkable that the linear odes for the integrals @xmath83 display all the nickelian singularities , as well as the new quadratic numbers @xmath94 found for @xmath17 .",
    "it is thus interesting to see how the singularities for @xmath93 are included in the singularities for @xmath95 and whether the new ( with respect to @xmath83 ) singularities can be given by one - dimensional integrals similar to @xmath83 .",
    "let us mention that the singularities of the linear ode for @xmath73 ( respectively @xmath74 ) _ are remarkably also singularities _ of the linear ode for @xmath76 ( respectively @xmath77 ) . in the following , we will show how this comes about and how it generalizes . for this , we solve in the sequel the landau conditions for the @xmath22-fold integrals ( [ in ] ) .",
    "we remind the reader that the landau conditions  @xcite are _ necessary _ conditions for singularities to be the singularities of the _ integral representation itself_. in a previous paper  @xcite , we have shown for particular integral representations belonging to the ising class integrals  @xcite , that in fact the solutions of landau conditions identify for specific configurations ( see below ) with the singularities of the ode associated with the quantity under consideration .    the landau conditions  @xcite amount to carrying out algebraic calculations  @xcite on the integrand ( [ in ] ) to get singularities of these @xmath0-fold integrals or even , as we will see in the sequel , singularities of the corresponding linear ode  @xcite .    in the sequel we use the following integral representation  @xcite : @xmath96    defining @xmath97 the integral @xmath55 ( see its expansion ( [ integral ] ) in [ a0 ] ) , becomes @xmath98 where the dirac delta s are introduced to take care of the conditions @xmath99 on both the angles @xmath100 and the auxillary angles @xmath101 .",
    "the landau conditions  @xcite can easily be written  @xcite : @xmath102 together with ( [ angles ] ) .",
    "the landau singularities are obtained by solving these equations in all the unknowns , where the parameters @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 should not be all equal to zero .    in this paper ,",
    "our aim is not to find all the solutions of the above equations but to show that the singularities of the linear ode for the @xmath50 are solutions of the landau conditions .",
    "furthermore , in working out various ising class integrals  @xcite and the two models of  @xcite ( see [ bb ] ) , we remarked that the singularities of the linear ode are , in fact , included in a particular `` configuration '' .",
    "what we mean by `` configuration '' is the set of values ( equal to zero or not ) of the parameters @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath106 .",
    "the `` configuration '' we consider @xmath107 corresponds to _ pinch singularities _ on the manifolds @xmath108 .",
    "one may also be convinced to take @xmath109 , since the integrand is periodic in @xmath100 and @xmath110 .",
    "let us stress that the the configuration considered where all the lagrange multipliers of the singularity manifolds @xmath111 are different from zero ( @xmath112 for any @xmath113 ) leads to the so - called _ leading landau singularities _ following the terminology of page 54 of  @xcite .",
    "the landau conditions become : @xmath114 and : @xmath115    the landau singularities are solutions of these conditions ( see [ singland ] for details ) .",
    "note that the first three conditions ( [ laneq1 ] ) , ( [ laneq2 ] ) , ( [ laneq3 ] ) are invariant by the transformation : @xmath116 but the landau conditions ( [ laneq1 ] ) , ( [ laneq2 ] ) , ( [ laneq3 ] ) together with ( [ angles2 ] ) are invariant by transformation ( [ trans ] ) _ if and only if _ @xmath0 _ is even_. this distinction between even and odd integer @xmath0 ( corresponding to the symmetry breaking of @xmath117 ) is reminiscent of the distinction between even and odd integer @xmath0 for the @xmath9 associated with the distinction between low and high temperature regimes .",
    "the landau conditions yield two families of singularities expressed in terms of chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind .",
    "the first family reads : @xmath118 , \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad    0 \\,\\,\\le\\,\\ , p_2\\ , \\,\\le\\ , \\,[n/2]\\,\\,-p_1 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second family is given by the elimination of @xmath119 from : @xmath120 with @xmath121.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one recognizes in the first set of equations ( [ famil1corps ] ) , a generalization of the singularities given by nickel @xcite for the pinch singularities coming from the product of the @xmath122 s , and also derived for our multiple integral denoted @xmath123 in  @xcite .",
    "these have been written as  @xcite : @xmath124 note that , comparatively to ( [ famil1corps ] ) , the integer @xmath125 should be even .",
    "the second set of equations ( [ famil2corps ] ) is a generalization of the singularities we derived for @xmath93 in  @xcite . in both formulae ,",
    "one notes the occurrence of a second varying integer @xmath126 , leading to a better understanding of the singularities of these integrals . indeed with @xmath126 running , the linear ode for @xmath50 will automatically contain all the singularities of the linear odes for @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 .    for @xmath131 , we have checked that the singularities specific to @xmath131 ( @xmath132 in ( [ famil1corps ] ) , ( [ famil2corps ] ) ) also appear as singularities of the linear ode in floating point form ( see appendix d for details ) . for @xmath133 , part of the singularities",
    "appear in floating point form , while for @xmath134 ( i.e. singularities of @xmath70 ) , no singularities appear in floating point form .",
    "similarly , for @xmath82 , we have checked that the singularities specific to @xmath82 ( @xmath135 in ( [ famil1corps ] ) , ( [ famil2corps ] ) ) also appear as singularities of the linear ode in floating point form ( see appendix d for details ) . for @xmath136 , no singularities appear in floating point form .",
    "let us remark that the non observation of some singularities in floating point form is not really significant .",
    "indeed , we have used 1250 ( resp .",
    "1200 terms ) for @xmath137 ( resp .",
    "@xmath138 ) while the @xmath137 and @xmath138 linear odes need more than 20000 terms .",
    ".2 cm figure [ f : fig1 ] shows the first family of singularities ( [ famil1corps ] ) displayed in the complex @xmath139 plane close enough to the unit @xmath139-circle .",
    "this figure clearly shows a quite rich structure for these set of points .",
    "this figure looks like a network of nodal points linked together by ( cardioid - like ) curves that can , at first sight , hardly be distinguished from arcs of circles . in particular the selected points",
    "@xmath140 as well as the singularities for @xmath141 , like @xmath142 can be seen to occur quite clearly as some of these nodal points .",
    "figure [ f : fig2 ] shows the first family of singularities ( [ famil1corps ] ) far from the unit circle .",
    "figure [ f : fig3 ] shows all the singularities altogether ( first and second family ) close to the unit @xmath139-circle .",
    "finally figure [ f : fig4 ] shows all the singularities together ( ( [ famil1corps ] ) , ( [ famil2corps ] ) ) that are not so close to the unit @xmath139-circle . .2",
    "cm    the accumulation of singularities one can see on figure [ f : fig1 ] near @xmath143 and @xmath144 seem to confirm the statement made in orrick _",
    "@xcite that these two points are two quite unpleasant points for the susceptibility of the ising model for which the series expansions are not even asymptotically convergent .",
    "besides reproducing exactly the singularities of the linear ode for @xmath50 , it is remarkable to see from the formula ( [ famil1corps ] ) , ( [ famil2corps ] ) , how to track where each singularity - polynomial comes from .",
    "this allows one to understand how the singularities of the ising like integrals @xmath123 and @xmath93 ( see @xcite ) and even the nickelian singularities ( [ sols ] ) emerge in these multiple integrals ( [ in ] ) .",
    "this comes simply from the partition ( [ part - integers ] ) and the equivalent one in ( [ famil1corps ] ) .",
    "consider for instance the singularities @xmath145 occurring in @xmath146 , which are given by ( [ famil1corps ] ) for @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath135 .",
    "as far as conditions on the integration angles ( see ( [ phi - diag ] ) below ) , this arises from a situation where two angles are equal and the three others are equal .",
    "recall that the @xmath93 integrals are constructed with the following restrictions on the angles : @xmath149 one sees that a generalization of this model ( [ phi - diag ] ) is simply : @xmath150.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by the condition on the angles , _ this case is indeed one dimensional _ , with : @xmath151    the model ( [ phi - diag ] ) is obviously given by ( [ diag - gener1 ] ) for @xmath152 .",
    "the nickelian singularities are also given by ( [ diag - gener1 ] ) for @xmath153 , but this time , the underlying model is `` zero - dimensional '' .",
    "the model constructed along the same lines as in  @xcite corresponds to an integrand : @xmath154 the nickelian singularities arise as poles .    for @xmath155 ,",
    "the singularities given by the model ( [ diag - gener1 ] ) , which appear in ( [ in ] ) , are thus given neither by ( [ sols ] ) nor by @xmath83 .",

    "the series of coefficients of @xmath162 is generated along the same lines as for @xmath83 ( see [ a0 ] ) .",
    "the fuchsian linear differential equation is of order six and this order is independent of the value of @xmath163 in ( [ phi5 ] ) .",
    "the singularities of the linear ode are zeros of the following polynomials : @xmath164 we obtain singularities ( from the last two polynomials ) appearing for @xmath165 and not occurring for @xmath166 .",
    "the occurrence of the singularities @xmath167 for ( the linear ode of ) @xmath76 _ but not for _ ( the linear ode of ) @xmath168 is explained along similar lines .",
    "note that these singularities are common to ( the linear ode of ) @xmath73 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the polynomial @xmath169 appears for ( the linear ode of ) @xmath76 from ( [ famil1corps ] ) , namely : @xmath170 one sees that the polynomial @xmath171 will appear for all combinations of @xmath22 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 such that : @xmath174 in other words , the polynomial that arises for given @xmath22 and @xmath172 , _ will also appear _ for the same value of @xmath172 and for @xmath175 .",
    "the singularities corresponding to @xmath176 occur for @xmath165 with @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 , but ( [ fulfill ] ) is also satisfied for @xmath180 , @xmath178 and @xmath132 which shows a situation with three angles , with two of them equal .",

    "we obtain the singularities @xmath190 and @xmath191 occurring for ( the linear ode of ) @xmath77 but not for ( the linear ode of ) @xmath192 .    similarly , for @xmath193 , ( @xmath194 goes to 3 ) , one obtains for @xmath195 , the singularities as zeros of the following polynomial @xmath196 , which has indeed been found numerically in the linear ode search on a large series corresponding to @xmath78 ( see [ singphi7phi8 ] ) .",
    "we have the remarkable fact that the singularities of the linear ode for the multiple integral @xmath50 are given by a finite set of singularities of linear odes of a set of one - dimensional integrals , namely , @xmath197 one - dimensional integrals , with @xmath198 $ ] .",
    "for instance , the singularities of the four - dimensional integral @xmath76 identify with those of , at most , three one - dimensional integrals .",
