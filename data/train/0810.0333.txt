    "one way to perform such a coherent control electrically is based on matrix berry phases@xcite .",
    "there are several semiconductor nanosystems with spin - orbit coupling terms @xcite that exhibit matrix berry phases : they include excitons@xcite , cdse nanocrystals@xcite , acceptor states of p - type semiconductors@xcite , and ring spin filters@xcite .",

    "are invariant under time - reversal operation @xcite and the discrete energy levels are doubly degenerate , and these properties are responsible for the generation of matrix berry phases@xcite .",
    "coherent manipulation can be achieved by changing external parameters adiabatically in time . according to the theory of matrix berry phase@xcite the groundstate of a doubly degenerate hilbert subspace of these ii - vi and iii - v n - type semiconductor quantum dots changes adiabatically in time as @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the instantaneous _ degenerate _ single electron or many - body eigenstates (",
    "the overline in @xmath2 means time - reversal state of @xmath1 ) .",
    "the time dependent schrdinger equation for the expansion coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath4 of eq.([eq : time - dep - state ] ) can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the adiabatic parameters labeled by @xmath8 .",
    "the time evolution of the groundstate is governed by the @xmath9 non - abelian vector potentials ( navps ) between the degenerate eigenstates @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "ii - vi and iii - v semiconductor quantum dots usually contain several electrons , and many - body effects may affect the matrix berry phase .",
    "formal expressions for many - body navps can be derived including many body exchange and correlation effects@xcite .",
    "correlation effects are taken into account by writing many body eigenstates as a linear combination of single slater determinant wavefunctions .",
    "when odd number of electrons are present the groundstates are doubly degenerate . at each time",
    "instant @xmath13 they can be written as linear combinations of slater determinant states @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is time reversal operator and @xmath17 is the number of instantaneous slater determinant states in the linear combinations .",
    "these states are time reversal states of each other .",
    "( we have suppressed @xmath13 in the quantities appearing in eq.([eq : groundstates ] ) , and from now on we will do so unless explicitly written ) .",
    "the diagonal elements of the navps are @xmath18 where the elements of the navp between slater determinant states are @xmath19 ( the slater determinant states in this expression can have different total confinement energies ) .",
    "it can be shown that if @xmath20 is non - zero one can find single - electron wavefunctions @xmath21 and @xmath22 so that @xmath23 when the single electron eigenstates @xmath21 and @xmath22 belong to different energy shells @xmath24 are called single electron _ inter - shell _ navps@xcite .",
    "the other diagonal elements @xmath25 are given by eq.([eq : diagonal ] ) except that @xmath26 is replaced by @xmath27 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements are @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "within this approach one can use a hartree - fock approximation based on single slater determinant groundstates , and show that fermion antisymmetry does not change the value of the matrix berry phase .",
    "these formal results have not been applied to investigate the interplay between matrix berry phase and many - body correlations of ii - vi and iii - v semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "for example , not much is known about how the effects beyond hartree - fock approximation , i.e. , correlation effects , change the matrix berry phase .",
    "the total many - electron hamiltonian consists of four terms : the kinetic part @xmath30 , confinement potential @xmath31 , spin - orbit terms @xmath32 , and electron - electron interactions @xmath33 : @xmath34 note that @xmath31 _ may or may not _ be invariant under two - dimensional inversion operation .",

    "it can be shown that , when the lateral electric confinement potential has inversion symmetry , i.e. , @xmath31 is invariant under two - dimensional inversion operation , the matrix berry phase is absent@xcite .",
    "this is because off - diagonal elements of single electron _",
    "intra - shell _ navps , eq.([eq : intra ] ) , may vanish .",
    "however , in the many - electron case the navps may take finite values since they are related to the single electron _ inter - shell _ navps , which can be non - zero , as can be seen from eq.([eq : inter ] ) .",
    "it is thus unclear whether the matrix berry phase remains zero or not .",
    "in addition , it is not understood how many - body correlation effects change quantitatively the matrix berry phase when a distortion potential breaks inversion symmetry of the lateral electric confinement potential .",
    "such a quantitative estimate should be valuable in understanding experimental results of matrix berry phases .    in order to investigate these issues we use the formal results of eqs.([eq : groundstates])-([eq : offdiagonal ] ) .",
    "we have investigated the effect of many - body correlations , and have found that they do not induce a finite matrix berry phase when the lateral confinement potential is invariant under two - dimensional inversion operation .",
    "this is an _ exact _",
    "the main physics is that although there is coupling between different single electron energy levels , many - body correlation effects cancel this coupling .",
    "on the other hand , for lateral confinement potentials without inversion symmetry we find that many - body quantum fluctuations change the matrix berry phase . in this case",
    "it is difficult to investigate exactly correlation effects .",
    "we have treated them in an approximation that includes a finite number @xmath17 of many - body basis vectors , and have performed a numerical computation to estimate the effect of quantum fluctuations on the matrix berry phase .",
    "our approximate calculation shows that the effect of quantum fluctuations on the matrix berry phase becomes more significant as the ratio between the coulomb strength and the single electron energy spacing increases .",
    "the main results of our investigation may be tested experimentally in semiconductor dots , as we discuss in sec.4 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we describe our model hamiltonian . in sec.3",
    "we compute the matrix berry phase when the lateral confinement potential is not invariant under two - dimensional inversion operation .",
    "discussions are given in sec.4 .",
    "the total single electron hamiltonian of a ii - vi or iii - v n - type semiconductor quantum dot contains an electric confinement potential and spin orbit coupling terms .",
    "an electron with the effective mass @xmath36 of such a system can be described by the hamiltonian@xcite @xmath37 where the two - dimensional lateral confinement potential is @xmath38 and the vertical confinement potential is @xmath39 ( here the two - dimensional coordinate is @xmath40 ) . an electric field e is applied along the z - axis and electrons are confined in a triangular potential @xmath39 , and it is assumed that only the lowest subband along the z - axis is occupied .",
    "thus in our model quantum dots are effectively quasi - two dimensional .",
    "the rashba constant @xmath41 changes when the electric field e is varied .",
    "the potential @xmath42 perturbs the two dimensional harmonic potential with the strengths @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this potential can be realized by applying a constant electric field along the y - axis and its strength @xmath45 is controlled by the magnitude of the applied electric field along the y - axis .",
    "the crucial point about @xmath46 and @xmath39 is that they can be changed _ electrically _ , which provides a means to control coherently electron spins .",
    "the rashba spin orbit term@xcite is @xmath47 with pauli spin matrices @xmath48 and a momentum operator @xmath49(similarly with @xmath50 ) .",
    "the dresselhaus term can be also included , but since it does not change results qualitatively we _ omit _ it here .",
    "the hamiltonian , eq.([eq : singleham ] ) , represents a simple model of the physical system , but it has all the correct symmetries .",
    "it is invariant under time reversal operation and each eigenenergy is doubly degenerate .",
    "the hamiltonian is not invariant under two - dimensional inversion operation @xmath51 since the rashba spin - orbit term breaks inversion symmetry . in order to build up many - body wavefunctions",
    "we need to first construct single electron eigenstates .",
    "each of these wavefunctions consists of the spin - up and down components : @xmath52 where @xmath53 are eigenstates of two - dimensional harmonic oscillators .",
    "when the lateral potential has two - dimensional inversion symmetry the effect of many - body correlations will not produce a finite value of the matrix berry phase . this can be shown to be an exact result .",
    "( see appendix b ) .",
    "it follows from the transformation properties of the wavefunctions under inversion operation .",
    "it should be stressed that although the lateral potential has inversion symmetry the total hamiltonian does not .",
    "when the inversion symmetry of @xmath46 is broken many - body correlations will induce a finite value of the matrix berry phase .",
    "it is not possible to compute this effect exactly unlike the case when @xmath46 has inversion symmetry . in a previous work",
    "a truncated single electron @xmath54 hamiltonian matrix was used@xcite .",
    "however , many - body states built from these approximate single electron wavefunctions do not adequately describe many - body correlation effects . in this paper",
    "we find improved single electron wavefunctions , and use them to build many - body wavefunctions . here",
    "we will compute the degenerate groundstates approximately by using a finite number of slater determinant basis states , i.e. , using @xmath55 in eq.([eq : groundstates ] ) .",
    "this approximation should be valid as long as the single electron energy spacing is larger than or comparable to the characteristic coulomb energy scale .",
    "we employ an improved approximation of a @xmath56 truncated single electron hamiltonian matrix , whose eigenvectors can be written , according to eq.([eq : single - eigen ] ) , as @xmath57 these expansion coefficients @xmath58 of the basis states @xmath59 are eigenvectors of the @xmath56 hamiltonian matrix    @xmath60    the basis vectors of this hamiltonian matrix are ordered as @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , etc . to reduce the number of independent external parameters we can set the ratio between the harmonic frequencies",
    "be a constant , for example , @xmath64 .",
    "then the energies of the two - dimensional harmonic oscillators are @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this matrix are @xmath68 where @xmath69 because of time reversal symmetry each eigenenergy is doubly degenerate .",

    "there is some arbitrariness in choosing these eigenstates since new eigenstates may be obtained by applying unitary transformation to the old set in each degenerate energy shell@xcite .",

    "the quantities @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 are too complicated and lengthy to give here , however , they are all purely real or imaginary .",
