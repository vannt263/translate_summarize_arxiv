    "soliton equations has been largely studied in the past in terms of integrability conditions and solutions @xcite .",
    "these solutions have been discovered through numerous techniques such as bcklund transformations , inverse scattering methods , lax pairs formulation , @xmath1-expansions , wronskian formulation and bilinear hirota method .",
    "the later ones will be of interest in this paper .",
    "to this instance , the hirota derivative is defined as @xmath2    in this paper , we consider the boiti - leon - manna - pempinelli ( blmp ) equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 and subscripts represent partial differentiation with respect to the given variable .",
    "this equation has received small attention @xcite and here we propose to give some new classical solutions through the hirota and wronskian methods .",
    "to do so , we note that the blmp equation is strongly related to the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation .",
    "indeed , let us take @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an arbitrary function of the variable @xmath7 , then @xmath8 satisfies @xmath9 defining @xmath10 , we see that @xmath11 satisfies the kdv equation , which has the following bilinear form @xcite @xmath12 using the change of variable @xmath13 .",
    "thus @xmath14 satisfies the blmp equation for @xmath15 a solution of the above bilinear equation associated to the kdv equation .",
    "this suggests that the blmp equation possesses multisoliton and rational similarity solutions and many other solutions as we will demonstrate .    without doing the reduction ( [ uform ] ) in @xmath16 but using the change of variable given above , we can bilinearize , in general , the blmp equation ( [ blmp ] ) by casting @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an arbitrary function of @xmath7 .",
    "one then gets the bilinear equation @xmath19    after considering the classical analysis of the blmp equation , it is natural to ask what would be its supersymmetric ( susy ) counterpart .",
    "susy extensions of nonlinear partial differential equation ( pde ) has , in the past few decades , been largely studied in terms of integrability and solutions , see for example @xcite . here , we consider for the first time a @xmath0 susy extension of the blmp equation ( [ blmp ] ) .",
    "to produce a @xmath0 susy extension of the blmp equation , we extend , as usual , the space @xmath20 to the superspace @xmath21 @xcite where @xmath22 is a grassmann variable which satisfies @xmath23 . as usual , we consider a fermionic superfield @xmath24 to get non trivial susy extensions @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0 susy extension of the blmp equation ( [ blmp ] ) is given as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denotes the supercovariant derivatives defined as @xmath28 using the finite taylor expansion @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a complex - valued fermionic ( odd ) function and @xmath31 is a complex - valued bosonic ( even ) function , we get a set of two equations @xmath32 in the fermionic limit where @xmath30 is set to zero , we retrieve the classical blmp equation as expected .    as in the classical case ,",
    "the susy blmp equation is related to the susy kdv equation . indeed ,",
    "supposing that @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 , then the above set of equations leads to @xmath36 in the fermionic limit , we get the classical kdv equation for the variable @xmath37 .",
    "the equations ( [ eqn11 ] ) and ( [ eqn22 ] ) becomes the susy kdv equation first proposed by manin and radul @xcite after identifying @xmath38 .",
    "we thus get a series of solutions of the susy blmp equation using this procedure .    in section 2 ,",
    "we give new classical solutions of the blmp equation using the wronskian and hirota bilinear formulation . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the susy bell polynomials which will be the key ingredient of our analysis . in section 4 , we give solutions of the susy blmp equation , _",
    "e.g. _ soliton and periodic solutions .",
    "there is also an attempt to find the superpartner solutions of the given classical solutions @xmath31 of the blmp equation . in section 5 ,",
    "we produce bilinear bcklund transformations using the susy bell polynomials described in section 3 .",
    "in the introduction , we have shown a link between the blmp equation and the kdv equation .",
    "it means that , for example , we can produce rational similarity solutions for the blmp equation based on the corresponding ones for kdv .",
    "indeed , for the rational similarity solutions @xcite , we get @xmath39 where the functions @xmath40 are known as the yablonskii - vorobev polynomials and are defined recursively @xcite as @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for example , we get the solutions @xmath44 this infinite series of rational similarity solutions have not been obtained before",
    ".    we can exhibit soliton solutions .",
    "indeed , for the @xmath45-soliton solution one gets for the function @xmath46 @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the above solutions has been deduced from the reduction of the blmp equation to the kdv equation via ( [ uform ] ) .    using a wronskian formulation for the kdv equation @xcite",
    ", we get rational , positon , negaton and complexiton solutions of the blmp equation . to this instance",
    ", we look for solutions @xmath50 of the following form @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "the resulting function @xmath55 is called a wronskian solution of order @xmath45 .",
    "the wronskian solution requires @xcite that the functions @xmath56 satisfy the following linear pde s @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "when @xmath59 is real , we get three cases of solutions : rational ( @xmath60 ) , positon ( @xmath61 ) and negaton ( @xmath62 ) . for the complexiton solution , the eigenvalues @xmath59 are supposed to be complex .",
    "here we give some examples and refer the interested readers to @xcite for further discussions on the wronskian solutions .    a negaton solution of second order @xmath63 a positon of second order @xmath64 and a complexiton @xmath65    ) for @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 , a negaton of second order ( [ un ] ) ( @xmath70 ) and a positon of second order ( [ up ] ) ( @xmath70 ) for @xmath35 and @xmath71.,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ] ) for @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 , a negaton of second order ( [ un ] ) ( @xmath70 ) and a positon of second order ( [ up ] ) ( @xmath70 ) for @xmath35 and @xmath71.,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ] ) for @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 , a negaton of second order ( [ un ] ) ( @xmath70 ) and a positon of second order ( [ up ] ) ( @xmath70 ) for @xmath35 and @xmath71.,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ]    where @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "indeed , if the following constraints are supposed @xmath80 where @xmath81 is an arbitrary complex constant , then the bilinear form ( [ genbili ] ) is automatically satisfied and we get a solution of the blmp equation @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are integration constants and @xmath18 is an arbitrary function of the variable @xmath7 used in ( [ bilinearfunction ] ) to bilinearize the blmp equation . at our knowledge ,",
    "the above solution is new .",
    "here we give an example for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , one gets the kink - type solution @xmath87    most of the above solutions are new and will be useful in subsequent sections to construct superpartners of the supersymmetric blmp equation .",
    "the bell polynomials are known as an alternative to tedious calculations of finding a bilinear form of an equation @xcite .",
    "indeed , we are able to rewrite the equation in terms of the bell polynomials and to get simultaneously the change of variable and the bilinear form of the studied equation . for more details ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .    for our present analysis",
    ", we introduce a particular case of the susy bell polynomials .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for a more general introduction to the susy bell polynomials .",
    "let @xmath88 be a superdifferentiable bosonic superfield @xcite where @xmath89 .",
    "the super bell polynomials are defined as @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the supercovariant derivatives defined in ( [ cov ] ) .",
    "the super bell polynomials enjoys a remarkable property given by @xmath92    the super binary polynomials are defined , using the super bell polynomials , as @xmath93 where the different derivatives of @xmath94 are replaced by the superfields @xmath95 and @xmath96 using the following procedure @xmath97 as an example , we have that @xmath98 the super binary bell polynomials are related to the susy hirota derivative @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have the following relation @xmath99 where the super hirota derivative is defined as @xmath100    the super @xmath101-polynomials @xcite are a particular class of ( [ binbell ] ) where we take @xmath102 .",
    "we have that @xmath103 a direct consequence of ( [ binbell ] ) is that @xmath104 whenever @xmath105 is odd .",
    "in this section , we propose a bilinear form of the susy blmp equation ( [ sblmp ] ) and give multisolitons and superpartner solutions . in order to get this form ,",
    "let us cast the change of variable @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a bosonic superfield , @xmath108 is a fermionic superfield and integrate with respect to @xmath109 and secondly by @xmath110 .",
    "we thus get the fermionic equation @xmath111 where the constants of integration as been set to zero and we recall that @xmath112 . using the following p - polynomials @xmath113 equation ( [ ssblmp ] ) can be rewritten as the polynomial equation @xmath114 we thus cast @xmath115 and we get the bilinear form of the susy blmp equation ( [ sblmp ] ) given by @xmath116 note that if @xmath117 then we get @xmath118 and , in terms of components , if @xmath119 , the bilinear equation ( [ sbilimod ] ) becomes @xmath120 in order to find the dispersion relations of @xmath121 and @xmath122 , one as to solve the set of equations @xmath123 which is equivalent to @xmath124 thus we get @xmath125 .",
    "this shows that to get non - trivial multisoliton solutions , one as to consider the super bilinear form @xmath126      as usual , in order to get super multisolitons of the susy blmp equation ( [ sblmp ] ) , we use the @xmath127-expansion of @xmath128 @xmath129 and substitute this expansion in the super bilinear form ( [ sbili ] ) . for the super travelling wave or one super soliton solution",
    ", we take @xmath130 and @xmath131 for all @xmath132 . introducing @xmath128 in the super bilinear form ( [ sbili ] )",

    "we refer the readers to @xcite for more details on the construction of supersymmetric multisoliton solutions .      in section 2 ,",
    "we have presented numerous classical solutions of the blmp equation ( [ blmp ] ) .",
    "here we get for some of them , the superpartner @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is an odd constant and @xmath140 using @xmath141 .",
    "let us consider solution ( [ trav ] ) which takes the form @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 . in this case",

    "bcklund transformations @xcite has been shown to be useful in constructing new solutions from known ones and give nonlinear superposition formulas .",
    "the above sections have exhibited new solutions of the classical and susy blmp equation .",
