    "novae near maximum light are so luminous - ranging from m@xmath4 to @xmath5 @xcite - that they can be detected with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) out to cosmologically interesting distances , beyond the useful ranges of rr lyrae stars , cepheids and planetary nebulae . after the announcement of their discovery in the andromeda galaxy @xcite",
    ", @xcite claimed that novae behave as standard candles , with light curves that can be interpreted to yield the distances to their host galaxies .",
    "zwicky s initial correlation between the maximum magnitude of a nova and its rate of decline ( now known as the mmrd relation ) , was improved upon by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if the mmrd relation did indeed calibrate novae as standard candles , then they could be used to independently measure distances to galaxies with cepheids .",
    "more important , they could determine distances to e.g. elliptical galaxies with no cepheids , to low luminosity dwarf galaxies @xcite , and even to intergalactic tramp novae @xcite which act as tracers of stars unbound to any galaxy .    because it is _",
    "not _ just wd mass , but also total accreted envelope mass that control nova tnrs , and because different accretion rates can produce a vast range of accreted envelope masses @xcite , the scatter in the mmrd was predicted to be significant @xcite .",
    "the many observed mmrd relations in the literature are summarised in @xcite .",
    "it is clear from their figure 17 that the observational scatter in an mmrd plot is far from negligible . with the discovery of",
    " faint , fast novae \" in m31 @xcite and in m87 @xcite , increasing the observed scatter in mmrd plots to 3 magnitudes , it is now evident from observations that the above - noted predictions from theory were correct : the mmrd has no value as a distance indicator @xcite .",
    "@xcite reached the same conclusion , based on a smaller and less densely sampled group of nine novae in the virgo cluster elliptical galaxy m49 .",
    "fortunately , there is another methodology that has been proposed to use novae as distance indicators .",
    "@xcite suggested that all novae reach roughly the same absolute magnitude , @xmath6 , about 15 days after maximum light .",
    "the goal of this paper is to use our recently - reported _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst )",
    "survey of novae in m87 , and their light curves , to provide the most robust determination of the epochs of minimum scatter , and the values of nova absolute magnitudes at those epochs in two of the most frequently - used hst filters .    in section 2",
    "we summarise our observations of well - observed novae in m87 . in section 3",
    "we plot the light curves of all m87 novae with well - observed maxima , and the daily standard deviations of those light curves , to demonstrate that the buscombe - de vaucouleurs relation _ is _ a very useful standard candle , and to determine the time and amplitude of its minimum scatter .",
    "we compare those results with previous determinations in section 4 , and offer guidelines for optimal use of novae as distance indicators .",
    "our results and conclusions are summarised in section 5 .",
    "we carried out daily _ hubble space telescope _",
    "advanced camera for surveys ( hst / acs ) imaging of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 in the f606w ( @xmath7 band ) and f814w ( @xmath8 band ) filters taken for hst cycle-14 program 10543 ( pi - e. baltz ) over the 72 day interval 24 december 2005 through 5 march 2006 , with a few 5-day gaps at the end of the run .",
    "full details of the observations , data reductions , detections and characterisations of 41 variables - 32 certain and 9 likely novae - and their images , and light and color curves , are given in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) .",
    "this survey for extragalactic novae is unprecedented , because hst observations rule out gaps due to weather , and there are no variations in limiting magnitude due to variable seeing or lunar phase .",
    "24 of the above noted 41 m87 novae were detected both before and after maximum light , and their brightnesses were measured within 12 hours of maximum light .",
    "the numbering of these novae below follows the nomenclature of paper i. our daily sampling over a 10 week span was deep enough to be almost impervious to m87 s background light , revealing novae to within 10 \" of the galaxy s nucleus .",
    "in addition , novae were detected over a nearly 6 magnitude range of brightness , so that even the faintest and fastest of novae were easily detected .",
    "the apparent hst f606w and f814w magnitudes of the novae presented in paper i were converted to absolute magnitudes using the distance modulus to m87 derived by @xcite , i.e. ( m - m)@xmath9 .",
    "the hst f606w and f814w light curves of 24 novae in m87 with well - defined maxima are shown in figures 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "the daily means of those light curves are shown in figure 3 , and the daily standard deviations of the light curves of those same 24 novae are presented in figure 4 .",
    "the largest sample of novae studied to measure the absolute magnitudes of novae 15 days after maximum light is due to @xcite . for 46 well - observed novae in m31 , the galaxy , and the magellanic clouds he determined @xmath10 = @xmath11 . @xcite and @xcite used their ground based samples of 11 and 6 galactic novae to determine values of @xmath12 = @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "@xcite used 15 galactic novae to determine @xmath12 = @xmath15 . finally , hst observations of 5 novae in m49 allowed @xcite to measure @xmath16 = @xmath17 .",
    "all of the above studies of galactic novae were plagued by ( relatively ) uncertain distances and reddenings , while the sample size of @xcite was only 5 novae .",
    "in addition , none of the above studies had cadences dense enough to definitively determine the epoch of minimum scatter of the absolute magnitudes of novae after maximum light .",
    "figure 4 yields the most robust determination ever of the epochs of minimum standard deviation of nova light curves . for",
    "the f606w filter the first significant minimum deviation occurs on day 17 ; for the f814w filter the minimum deviation occurs on day 20 .",
    "( minor local minima afterwards are ignored ) .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the @xcite empirical , photographic determination of minimum deviation at 15 days after maximum light , but our sample is larger , of higher cadence and based on hst ccd magnitudes.we use the m87 distance modulus noted in section 2 , and assume absorptions to m87 of a(v ) = 0.07 and a(i ) = 0.04 .",
    "the absolute f606w and f814w magnitudes on those dates , from figure 3 , are then @xmath18 = @xmath1 and @xmath19 = @xmath3 .",
    "these values are the key result of this paper . in light of our relatively large sample of m87 novae ,",
    "all at the same distance , our dense sampling with no gaps , invariant seeing and immunity to lunar phase , we suggest that our derived values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 are now the most reliable values when using novae as standard candles .",
    "using a sample of 24 novae in m87 observed daily with hst , we have determined that the optimal epochs for using novae as distance indicators are at 17 and 20 days after maximum light , when using the hst f606w and f814 filters , respectively .",
    "the absolute f606w and f814w magnitudes on those dates are @xmath18 = @xmath1 and @xmath19 = @xmath3 .",
