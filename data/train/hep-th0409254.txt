    "recently , much work has been devoted to the study of the operator @xmath0 in four dimensional yang - mills theories in the landau gauge , where a renormalizable effective potential for this operator can be consistently constructed @xcite .",
    "this has produced analytic evidence of a nonvanishing condensate @xmath2 , resulting in a dynamical mass generation for the gluons @xcite .",
    "a gluon mass in the landau gauge has been reported in lattice simulations @xcite as well as in a recent investigation of the schwinger - dyson equations @xcite . besides being multiplicatively renormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory in the landau gauge ,",
    "the operator @xmath0 displays remarkable properties .",
    "in fact , it has been proven @xcite by using brst  ward identities that the anomalous dimension @xmath3 of the operator @xmath0 in the landau gauge is not an independent parameter , being expressed as a combination of the gauge beta function , @xmath4 , and of the anomalous dimension , @xmath5 , of the gauge field , according to the relation @xmath6 which can be explicitly verified by means of the three loop computations available in @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath7 turns out to be multiplicatively renormalizable also in the linear covariant gauges @xcite .",
    "its condensation and the ensuing dynamical gluon mass generation in this gauge have been discussed in @xcite .    moreover , the operator @xmath0 in the landau gauge can be generalized to other gauges such as the curci - ferrari and maximal abelian gauges .",
    "indeed , as was shown in @xcite , the mixed gluon - ghost operator runs only over the @xmath8 off - diagonal components .",
    "] @xmath9 turns out to be brst  invariant on - shell , where @xmath10 is the gauge parameter . in both gauges ,",
    "the operator @xmath11 turns out to be multiplicatively renormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory and , as in the case of the landau gauge , its anomalous dimension is not an independent parameter of the theory @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the analytic evaluation of the effective potential for the condensate @xmath12 in these gauges can be found in @xcite . in particular , it is worth emphasizing that in the case of the maximal abelian gauge , the off - diagonal gluons become massive due to the gauge condensate @xmath13 , a fact that can be interpreted as evidence for the abelian dominance hypothesis underlying the dual superconductivity mechanism for color confinement .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyse the renormalization properties of the operator @xmath14 in three dimensional yang - mills theories in the landau gauge",
    ". this investigation might be useful in order to study by analytical methods the formation of the condensate @xmath15 in three dimensions , whose relevance for the yang - mills theories at high temperatures has been pointed out long ago @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the possibility of a dynamical gluon mass generation related to the operator @xmath7 could provide a suitable infrared cutoff which would prevent three dimensional yang - mills theory from the well known infrared instabilities @xcite , due to its superrenormalizability .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sect.2",
    "we discuss the renormalizability of the three dimensional yang - mills theory in the landau gauge , when the operator @xmath16is added to the starting action in the form of a mass term , @xmath17",
    ". we shall be able to prove that the renormalization factor @xmath18 of the mass parameter @xmath19 can be expressed in terms of the renormalization factors @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the gluon field and of the gauge coupling constant , according to @xmath22 this relation represents the analogue in three dimensions of the eq.@xmath23 .",
    "in sect.3 we give an explicit verification of the relation @xmath24 by using the large @xmath1 expansion method .",
    "in sect.4 we present the generalization to the nonlinear curci - ferrari gauge .",
    "in order to analyze the renormalizability of three dimensional yang - mills theory , in the presence of the mass term @xmath25 , we start from the following gauge fixed action @xmath26 with @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the lagrange multiplier enforcing the landau gauge condition , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the faddeev - popov ghosts . concerning the mass term in expression @xmath32 , two remarks are in order .",
    "the first one is that , although in three dimensions the gauge field might become massive due to the introduction of the chern - simons topological action @xcite , one should note that the mass term considered here is of a different nature .",
    "in fact , unlike the chern - simons term , the mass term @xmath33 does not break parity . as a consequence , the starting action @xmath34 is parity preserving .",
    "therefore , the parity breaking chern - simons term can not show up due to radiative corrections .",
    "the second remark is related to the superrenormalizabilty of three dimensional yang - mills theories , as expressed by the dimensionality of the gauge coupling @xmath35 . as shown in @xcite , a standard perturbation theory",
    "would be affected by infrared singularities in the massless case .",
    "however , the presence of the mass term prevents the theory from this infrared instability , allowing one to define an infrared safe perturbative expansion .    following @xcite , the action @xmath36 is left invariant by a set of modified brst  transformations , given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 notice that , due to the introduction of the mass term @xmath39 , the operator @xmath40 is not strictly nilpotent , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath41 therefore , setting @xmath42 we have @xmath43 the operator @xmath44 is related to a global @xmath45 symmetry @xcite , which is known to be present in the landau , curci - ferrari and maximal abelian gauges @xcite .",
    "finally , in order to express the brst  and @xmath44 invariances in a functional way , we introduce the external action @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are external sources invariant under both brst and @xmath49 transformations , coupled to the nonlinear variations of the fields @xmath50 and @xmath31 .",
    "it is easy to check that the complete classical action , @xmath51 is invariant under brst and @xmath44 transformations @xmath52 when translated into functional form , the brst and the @xmath44 invariances give rise to the following ward identities for the complete action @xmath53 , namely    * the slavnov - taylor identity    @xmath54    * with @xmath55 * the @xmath44 ward identity @xmath56 with @xmath57    in addition , the following ward identities holds in the landau gauge @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _    * the gauge fixing condition and the antighost equation @xmath58 * the integrated ghost equation @xcite @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 notice that the breaking term @xmath62 in the right - hand side of eq.@xmath63 , being linear in the quantum fields , is a classical breaking , not affected by quantum corrections @xcite .      having established all ward identities obeyed by the classical action @xmath53 , we can now proceed with the characterization of the most general local counterterm compatible with the identities ( [ sti ] ) , ( [ wwi ] ) , ( [ beq ] ) and ( [ gh ] ) .",
    "let us begin by displaying the quantum numbers of all fields , sources and parameters @xmath64 in order to characterize the most general invariant counterterm which can be freely added to all orders of perturbation theory , we perturb the classical action @xmath53 by adding an arbitrary integrated , parity preserving , local polynomial @xmath65 in the fields and external sources of dimension bounded by three and with zero ghost number , and we require that the perturbed action @xmath66 satisfies the same ward identities and constraints as @xmath53 to first order in the perturbation parameter @xmath67 , which are @xmath68 this amounts to imposing the following conditions on @xmath69@xmath70 with @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 following the algebraic renormalization procedure @xcite , it turns out that the most general local , parity preserving , invariant counterterm @xmath69 compatible with all constraints ( [ stt ] ) , ( [ dw ] ) , ( [ bc ] ) and ( [ gc ] ) , contains only two independent free parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and is given by @xmath77      it remains now to discuss the stability of the classical action @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ to check that @xmath65 can be reabsorbed in the classical action @xmath78 by means of a multiplicative renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath35 , the mass parameter @xmath19 , the fields @xmath79 and the sources @xmath80 , namely @xmath81 with the bare fields and parameters defined as @xmath82 the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 , are easily seen to be related to the renormalization of the gauge coupling constant @xmath35 and of the gauge field @xmath50 , according to @xmath83 concerning the other fields and the sources @xmath47 , @xmath48 , it can be verified that they are renormalized as @xmath84 @xmath85 finally , for the mass parameter @xmath19 , @xmath86 which , due to eq.([rgh ] ) , can be rewritten as @xmath87 equation ( [ rgh ] ) expresses the well known nonrenormalization property of the ghost - antighost - gluon vertex in the landau gauge . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "this is a direct consequence of the ghost ward identity ( [ gh ] ) .",
    "also , as anticipated , equation ( [ rm ] ) shows that the renormalization of the mass parameter @xmath19 can be expressed in terms of the gauge field and coupling constant renormalization factors .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that eqs.([rgh ] ) , ( [ rm ] ) are in complete agreement with the results obtained in the case of the four dimensional yang - mills theory in the landau gauge @xcite .",
    "although we did not consider matter fields in the previous analysis , it can be easily checked that the renormalizability of the mass operator @xmath0 and the relations ( [ rm ] ) , ( [ rm1 ] ) remain unchanged if massless spinor fields are included , namely @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "in fact , as was pointed out in @xcite , the addition of massless fermions does not break the parity invariance of the starting action @xmath90 .",
    "of course , the inclusion of the matter action ( [ sf ] ) requires the introduction of a suitable renormalization factor @xmath91 for the spinor fields .      in the previous section",
    "we have proven that the massive three dimensional yang - mills action ( [ si ] ) is multiplicatively renormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory , displaying interesting renormalization features , as expressed by equations ( [ rgh ] ) and ( [ rm ] ) .",
    "only two renormalization constants , @xmath21  and @xmath20 , are needed at the quantum level .",
    "these factors should be computed order by order by means of a suitable regularization , which in the present case could be provided by dimensional regularization . due to the absence of parity breaking terms",
    ", this would give an invariant regularization scheme .",
    "furthermore , we recall that yang - mills theory in three dimensions is a superrenormalizable theory , a property which reduces the number of divergent integrals .",
    "it is thus worth looking at the feynman diagrams of the theory .",
    "let us begin with the one loop ghost - antighost self - energy .",
    "it is almost trivial to check that , due to the transversality of the gluon propagator in the landau gauge , the feynman integral for the ghost self - energy @xmath92 where @xmath93 stands for the external momentum , is free from ultraviolet divergences . as",
    "a consequence we have that , at one loop order in @xmath94 , @xmath95 analogously , by simple inspection , it turns out that the one loop correction to the ghost - antighost - gluon vertex is also finite .",
    "the same feature holds for the one loop feynman diagrams contributing to the four gluon vertex , from which it follows that in @xmath94 @xmath96 moreover , from equation ( [ rgh ] ) , we have @xmath97 so that @xmath98 in @xmath94 .",
    "we see therefore that , at one loop order , the theory is completely free from ultraviolet divergences , a feature which also holds in the presence of massless fermions . at",
    "higher orders , ultraviolet divergences could show up .    to provide a non - trivial check of the validity of the relation ( [ g1 ] ) from another point of view",
    ", we shall make use of the large @xmath1 expansion , given the existence of a fixed point in the @xmath99-function . within this large @xmath1 expansion technique",
    ", it is commonly known that this fixed point can be obtained by analytic continuation of the one existing in @xmath100 dimensions .",
    "this will be considered in the following section .",
    "having established the renormalizability of the mass operator in the landau gauge , we verify the result in qcd using the large @xmath1 critical point method developed in @xcite for the non - linear @xmath75 model and extended to qed and qcd in @xcite .",
    "briefly , this method allows one to compute the critical exponents associated with the renormalization of the fields , coupling constants or composite operators at the @xmath101-dimensional fixed point of the qcd @xmath102-function .",
    "the critical exponents encode all orders information on the respective anomalous dimensions , @xmath103-function and operator anomalous dimensions and are more fundamental than their associated renormalization group functions in that they are renormalization group invariant . knowing the explicit location of the @xmath101-dimensional fixed point allows one to convert the information encoded in the exponents to the explicit coefficients in the four dimensional perturbative expansion of the renormalization group functions .",
    "since we are interested in the renormalization of @xmath104 in the landau gauge and its connection with the gluon and ghost wave function renormalization we will show that , in agreement with eqs.([rm ] ) , ( [ rm1 ] ) , the critical exponent associated with the landau gauge renormalization of @xmath105 at leading order in large @xmath1 is simply the sum of the gluon and ghost wave function critical exponents .",
    "the latter have already been determined in @xcite . moreover , since the computation is in @xmath101-dimensions , @xmath106  @xmath107  @xmath101  @xmath107  @xmath108 , the three dimensional result of the previous sections will emerge _",
    "naturally_.      as we are interested in the critical exponents and therefore the anomalous dimensions of the composite operator @xmath132 in the large @xmath1 expansion , we follow the method of @xcite . there",
    "the critical exponent @xmath133 associated with the qcd @xmath99-function was computed at @xmath134 in @xmath101-dimensions by inserting the composite operator @xmath135 into a gluon @xmath106-point function and applying the method of @xcite to determine the critical dimension of its associated coupling . for the anomalous dimension of @xmath104",
    "we follow the same approach and note that the appropriate @xmath134 large @xmath1 diagrams are given in figure 1 where a gluon line counts one power of @xmath120 which is why there are two _ and _ three loop feynman diagrams at this order .",
    "the latter three loop graph in fact contains the relevant contribution from the triple gluon vertex which is absent in the natm lagrangian . unlike perturbation theory",
    "the propagators of figure 1 are not the usual ones .",
    "their asymptotic scaling forms are deduced from dimensional analysis and consistency with lorentz symmetry . in the landau gauge",
    "we have , @xcite , @xmath136 ~~,~~ c(k ) ~\\sim~ \\frac{c}{(k^2)^{\\mu-\\gamma}}\\ ; , \\label{nfprops}\\ ] ] in momentum space at leading order as @xmath137 as one approaches the @xmath101-dimensional fixed point .",
    "we have given the ghost propagator asymptotic scaling form for completeness and to define its scaling dimension even though it is not needed at @xmath134 for the explicit computation of the critical exponent of @xmath138 .",
    "the powers of the propagators are defined as @xmath139 where @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the momentum independent amplitudes though only the combinations @xmath143 and @xmath144 appear in calculations , @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath145 for shorthand , @xmath146 is the critical exponent of the quark field , @xmath147 is the critical exponent of the quark - gluon vertex anomalous dimension and @xmath148 is the ghost critical exponent .",
    "we note that the explicit @xmath134 values of the critical exponents in @xmath101-dimensions in the landau gauge are , @xcite , @xmath149 \\frac{\\eta^{\\mbox{o}}_1}{t_f } ~~,~~ \\eta_{c \\ , 1 } ~=~ - \\ , \\frac{c_a\\eta^{\\mbox{o}}_1}{2(\\mu-2)t_f }   \\;,\\label{expvals}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we will use the notation @xmath150 . the expression for the ghost anomalous dimension follows from the usual slavnov - taylor identity as expressed in exponent language , @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the anomalous dimension of the ghost - gluon vertex and was shown in @xcite to vanish in the landau gauge at @xmath134 .",
    "the explicit computation of the exponent associated with the renormalization of @xmath104 , which we will call @xmath153 , is deduced by inserting ( [ nfprops ] ) into the diagrams of figure 1 and applying the procedure of @xcite to determine the scaling dimension of the operator insertion , @xmath154 .",
    "the value of @xmath153 is deduced from the relation @xmath155 where the first two terms correspond to the anomalous part of the gluon critical dimension or wave function renormalization . for completeness",
    "we note that the corresponding critical exponent in the thirring model , @xmath156 , is deduced by dimensionally analysing the final term of ( [ natmlag ] ) giving @xmath157 in practice a regularization has to be introduced for the feynman integrals which is obtained by shifting the exponent of the vertex renormalization , @xmath147 , to the new value of @xmath158 . here",
    "@xmath159 plays a role akin to @xmath160 in dimensional regularization . though it should be stressed that we are working in fixed dimensions , @xmath101 , and not dimensionally regularizing here . the actual contribution to @xmath154",
    "is determined from the residue of the simple pole in @xmath159 from the sum of all the diagrams of figure 1 . in @xcite",
    "the two and three loop diagrams were computed using various techniques such as integration by parts and uniqueness , @xcite , after the regularized feynman integrals were broken up into a set of basic integrals which were straightforward to determine and a set which required a substantial amount of effort particularly in the case of the three loop diagram .",
    "we have used the same integrals here but supplemented with an extra set since the operator insertion of @xmath104 alters the power of the internal gluon line containing the operator insertion .",
    "an example of one of the tedious graphs in this respect is that illustrated in figure 2 where we have indicated the power of the propagator beside the line .",
    "we have used coordinate space representation where one integrates over the location of the internal vertices , @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 , but with @xmath164 corresponding to the external coordinate or momentum of the diagram . to determine the residue with respect to the @xmath159-pole we convert the integral to momentum representation , @xcite , which produces the first diagram of figure 3 . there",
    "we have nullified the regularization since the associated factor from the transformation is @xmath165 which , due to the denominator factor , is clearly divergent as @xmath159  @xmath166  @xmath167 since @xmath168  @xmath112  @xmath169 .",
    "to proceed we use the language of @xcite and apply a conformal transformation to the first diagram of figure 3 based on the left external point .",
    "then integrating the unique triangle and subsequent unique vertex before undoing the original conformal transformation finally produces the second diagram of figure @xmath129 . the factor associated with these manipulations from the first diagram of figure 3",
    "is @xmath170 . to deduce the value of the final diagram which is @xmath159-finite we integrate by parts on the top right internal vertex based on the line with exponent 1",
    "this produces four two loop diagrams .",
    "however , these intermediate diagrams are in fact divergent though their sum is finite .",
    "to ensure the correct finite part emerges , one introduces a temporary intermediate regularization prior to integrating by parts by shifting the exponent of the line labeled @xmath171 to an exponent of @xmath172 .",
    "in fact two of the resulting diagrams then cancel exactly , leaving two integrals which are related to the function @xmath173 defined in @xcite and evaluated exactly in @xcite .",
    "explicitly one has the difference of @xmath174 and @xmath175 and expanding in powers of @xmath49 a finite expression emerges .",
    "accumulating all the contributions the final contribution of the integral of figure 2 to the critical exponent computation is @xmath176    having completed the computation of all the intermediate basic integrals we note that the transverse contribution of each of the four diagrams of figure 1 to @xmath177 are respectively , @xmath178\\eta _ { 1}^{\\mbox{o}}}{2(\\mu -2)t_{f}}~~ ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{(\\mu -1)^{2}c_{a}\\eta _ { 1}^{\\mbox{o}}}{(\\mu -2)t_{f}}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , @xmath179 in @xmath101-dimensions .",
    "clearly this is equivalent to the sum of anomalous dimension parts of the landau gauge gluon and ghost critical exponents at @xmath134 .",
    "more explicitly , from ( [ expdefn ] ) and ( [ expvals ] ) , @xmath180 which due to our choice of conventions and notation was the way this identity was originally uncovered in @xcite prior to the all orders proof of @xcite and its subsequent expression in the form of ( [ g1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , ( [ stnfreln ] ) is an explicit @xmath101-dimensional verification of the all orders result of the previous section .",
    "moreover , it nicely recovers the @xmath101-dimensional case of @xcite .",
    "as three dimensional qcd is of interest in other problems , we note that the explicit three dimensional value of @xmath156 is @xmath181 in two dimensions , interestingly the critical exponent does not run to its mean field value and one has @xmath182",
    "the mass operator @xmath0 in the landau gauge can be generalized to other gauges , such as the curci - ferrari and the maximal abelian gauge . in this case",
    "the mixed gluon - ghost mass operator @xmath183 has to be considered , where @xmath10 stands for the gauge parameter .",
    "let us consider here the case of the curci - ferrari nonlinear gauge .",
    "for the gauge fixed action we have @xmath184 notice that in this case also the faddeev - popov ghosts @xmath30,@xmath185 are massive .",
    "moreover , the curci - ferrari gauge reduces to the landau gauge in the limit @xmath186 .",
    "the action ( [ cf ] )  is invariant under the brst and @xmath44 transformations of eqs.([sm ] ) , ( [ d ] ) . introducing the external action",
    "@xmath187 it follows that the complete classical action @xmath188 turns out to be constrained by the slavnov - taylor identity @xmath189 and by the @xmath44 ward identity @xmath190 due to the presence of the quartic ghost - antighost term @xmath191 and of @xmath192 the additional ward identities ( [ beq ] ) and ( [ gh ] ) of the landau gauge do not hold in the present case .",
    "nevertheless , identities ( [ stcf ] ) and ( [ dwcf ] ) ensure the multiplicative renormalizability of the model . proceeding as in the previous section ,",
    "it turns out that the most general invariant counterterm contains five free independent parameters , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 and is given by @xmath196 the parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 are easily seen to correspond to a multiplicative renormalization of the fields , sources and parameters , according to @xmath197 and @xmath198 in particular , from eqs.([zmcf ] ) it follows that the renormalization factor @xmath18 is not independent , being expressed in terms of the ghost renormalization factor @xmath199  and of the renormalization factor @xmath200 of the source @xmath48 coupled to the composite ghost operator @xmath201 .",
    "again , these results are in complete agreement with those obtained in the four dimensional case @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have analysed the renormalization properties of the mass operator @xmath0 in three dimensional yang - mills theories in the landau gauge . in analogy with the four dimensional case ,",
    "the renormalization factor @xmath18 is not an independent parameter of the theory , as expressed by the relations ( [ rm ] ) and ( [ rm1 ] ) , which have been explicitly verified in the large @xmath1 expansion method .",
    "these results will be used in order to investigate by analytical methods the possible formation of the gauge condensate @xmath202 .",
    "this would provide a dynamical generation of a parity preserving mass for the gluons in three dimensions , a topic which has been extensively investigated in recent years .",
    "for instance , see @xcite .    finally , we underline that the curci - ferrari gauge allows one to study the generalized mixed gluon - ghost condensate @xmath203 . in particular ,",
    "as discussed in the four dimensional case , the presence of the gauge parameter @xmath10 could be useful to investigate the gauge independence of the vacuum energy , due to the formation of the aforementioned condensates .",
