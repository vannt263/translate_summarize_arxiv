    "the electronic structure of atoms and molecules is usefully probed by external electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the development of intense lasers has permitted such probing in regimes where simple perturbative treatments are not valid and one must use a nonperturbative semiclassical approximation or a numerical approach .",
    "experiments with molecules display a much richer range of phenomena than with atoms , due to the additional molecular degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "these include above threshold ionization @xcite , multiple ionization @xcite , alignment effects @xcite , electron localization @xcite , non - sequential double ionization @xcite , direct excitation @xcite , stabilization @xcite , dissociative recombination @xcite , and separation effects @xcite .",
    "however , molecules ( even the simplest diatomic molecules ) and their ionization are clearly more difficult to treat theoretically .",
    "many approximation techniques have been developed and applied to atomic ionization processes @xcite , but much less is known for molecular systems .",
    "realistic calculations are rather complicated and one loses some of the physical intuition that can often be gained from simple models . in this paper",
    "we present the exact analytical solution for a simple molecular ionization model .",
    "the molecule is taken to be one - dimensional .",
    "this approximation is remarkably good in the strong - field regime where the ionization is predominantly along the field direction , so that the system is effectively one - dimensional @xcite .",
    "the simplest such one - dimensional molecule consists of two atomic wells represented by attractive delta function wells of strength @xmath0 , separated by a distance @xmath1 .",
    "this is a well - known soluble model @xcite .",
    "this molecule always supports an even parity bound ground state and a continuum , and if @xmath2 it also supports an odd parity bound excited state .",
    "there is a long tradition of using model potentials such as zero - range potentials in atomic and molecular physics @xcite .",
    "the presence of an external electrostatic field , of field strength @xmath3 , dramatically changes the basic character of the spectrum , converting the bound states into quasi - bound states and modifying the resonance structure of the continuum .",
    "these spectral changes are seen directly in the spectral function @xmath4 : the quasi - bound states are poles of @xmath4 at complex values of the energy @xmath5 , where the real part of the pole gives the energy location of the quasi - bound level and the imaginary part gives the width , and hence lifetime , of the level .",
    "since this molecular ionization model is exactly soluble , we can easily investigate the dependence of these quasi - bound levels on the relevant physical parameters  the field strength @xmath3 , the atomic well depth @xmath0 , and the atomic separation parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the same applies for the `` continuum '' , where resonance structures appear due to the delicate interplay between tunneling , binding and scattering effects .",
    "the solution presented here uses the weyl - titchmarsh - kodaira ( wtk ) spectral theorem @xcite .",
    "this spectral theorem expresses the completeness of the wavefunctions of the schrdinger equation in a general way that applies not just to the familiar discrete spectrum models ( such as the infinite square well or the harmonic oscillator ) , but also to systems with discrete and continuum spectra ( such as the finite square well or the hydrogen atom ) , and even to systems with a purely continuous spectrum , such as for ionization problems where there are no true bound states .",
    "the wtk approach is well suited for numerical implementation and has been applied long ago to the stark effect in atomic hydrogen @xcite .",
    "an interesting soluble one - dimensional atomic model consisting of a single finite square well on the half - line is solved using the wtk method in @xcite .",
    "more recently , the numerical wtk approach has been used for studying strong - field ionization effects in effectively one - dimensional diatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "various numerical and approximate methods for computing resonance locations and widths are compared in @xcite .",
    "this current paper is complementary to @xcite , but the choice to represent the atomic wells by delta function wells makes the entire molecular ionization problem analytically solvable , thereby bypassing the numerical part of the computation .",
    "we also mention that this one - dimensional molecular ionization model has been studied in @xcite using the solution of the associated lippman - schwinger equation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains a summary of the implementation of the weyl - titchmarsh - kodaira ( wtk ) method for computing the spectral function .",
    "this is applied in section 3 to the one - dimensional molecular model without an applied electric field . in section 4 the electric field",
    "is applied and the exact solution for the spectral function is derived .",
    "the dependence of the spectral function on the various physical parameters is explored through plots and also analytically .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the simpler case of atomic ionization , obtained from the molecular solution by taking the atomic separation parameter , @xmath6 , to zero . in this case",
    "we also study the large orders of perturbation theory for the stark shift and show its relation to the nonperturbative level width .",
    "the final section contains some concluding comments .",
    "the weyl - titchmarsh - kodaira ( wtk ) spectral theorem @xcite for quantum mechanical hamiltonians is very general , covering not just simple hamiltonians like the harmonic oscillator which have only bound states , but also hamiltonians with both bound and continuum states .",
    "it also extends to ionization problems where the spectrum is purely continuum .",
    "indeed , in his classic book @xcite , titchmarsh solves the half - line `` atomic '' problem of a binding delta function potential well plus a constant electric field .",
    "this approach can be applied directly to any one - dimensional or radial schrdinger problem .",
    "the wtk method can be summarized as follows .",

    "similarly , going to the left , we construct the linear combination _ - ( x , e)=u_-(x , e)+m_-(e ) v_-(x , e ) [ mm ] such that it is normalizable on the interval @xmath17 when the energy @xmath5 has a small positive imaginary part .",
    "this determines the coefficient function @xmath20 .",
    "the spectral function , and the completeness of the wavefunctions , can be expressed in terms of these coefficient functions @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "for example , the spectral function is ( e)=_0 ( ) [ spectral ] this wtk method is well suited to numerical implementation for arbitrary potential wells @xcite . in the models studied in this paper",
    "the situation is even simpler , since the independent solutions @xmath10 and @xmath11 are known in analytic form for all @xmath22 ; the `` integration '' process simply involves applying the correct continuity and discontinuity boundary conditions at the locations of the two delta function potentials .",
    "this will be shown in detail in section [ molelectric ] .",
    "we first review the model without the electric field . we choose the following simple double - delta - function potential to represent the diatomic molecule : v(x)= - g[potential ] where @xmath23 .",
    "this potential has two binding delta - function wells located at @xmath24 , and chosen for simplicity to have equal strength @xmath25 .",
    "this problem , without an external electric field , is a standard problem in quantum mechanics courses @xcite .",
    "the potential ( [ potential ] ) always supports a bound ground state which has even parity , and if @xmath26 it also supports a bound excited state which has odd parity . in this section",
    "we present the wtk solution as an introductory illustration of the method .    in the vicinity of @xmath9 the potential ( [ potential ] ) vanishes .",
    "thus , the two independent solutions , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , of the schrdinger equation ( [ schrod ] ) , which satisfy the normalization conditions ( [ norm ] ) are u(x , e)= ( x ) , v(x , e)= - .",

    "the widths of the quasi - bound states can be derived from the imaginary part of the poles of the spectral function . because of the complicated dependence of the quasi - bound state energies on the system parameters @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath6 , it is difficult to derive simple analytical expressions for the line widths . however , in the large atomic separation limit , as @xmath63 , we can use wkb to approximate the tunneling rate , and hence the line width , as @xmath82 \\label{width}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the full stark - shifted energy of the lower quasi - bound state .    in the limit of infinitely large well strength , @xmath85 , the @xmath86 term in ( [ poles ] ) dominates and",
    "the zeros of ( [ poles ] ) lie on the positive real axis .",
    "if the field strength @xmath3 is small , the first order asymptotic expansion of the airy functions @xcite : @xmath87 for @xmath88 can be used to estimate the location of the zeros of ( [ poles ] ) .",
    "these approximate zeros are determined by the expressions : @xmath89 note that expression ( [ fwrexpression ] ) approximates the zeros of @xmath90 , while ( [ wwrexpression ] ) approximates the zeros of @xmath91 .",
    "solutions for expression ( [ fwrexpression ] ) are the energies obtained using the wkb approximation for a half wedge potential with an infinitely high wall at @xmath44 . therefore , we interpret the energies satisfying ( [ fwrexpression ] ) as those of the backscattering states between the left well and the electric field , which is the ramsauer effect illustrated in figures 5 and 6 . similarly , expression ( [ wwrexpression ] ) yields the same set of energies obtained from the wkb approximation for a potential well in an electric field with infinitely high walls at @xmath44 and @xmath92 , and therefore ( [ wwrexpression ] ) determines the energies of backscattering states between the two wells , also in the presence of the electric field .",
    "in general , the exact resonances reflect a competition of these scatterings amongst the linear potential and the atomic wells .",
    "a nice feature of our molecular analysis is that the `` atomic '' analogue of the molecular model studied in section [ molelectric ] can be obtained simply by setting the separation parameter , @xmath6 , of the two wells to zero .",
    "all the expressions carry over smoothly in this @xmath93 limit .",
    "the corresponding potential is ( note that the delta function strength becomes @xmath94 in this limit ) : v(x)=-2 g ( x)-fx [ atompotential ] this atomic problem has also been discussed in terms of the corresponding green s functions in @xcite .      the spectral function is given , as before in ( [ starkspectral ] ) , by ( e)=_0 i m ( ) [ atomspectral ] where the coefficient functions in ( [ pluscoeff ] ) and ( [ minuscoeff ] ) now simplify to : a_+^(u)(e)&= & ( bi^(- ) - g f^-1/3 bi(- ) ) + b_+^(u)(e)&=&- ( ai^(- ) -g f^-1/3 ai(- ) ) + a_+^(v)(e)&=&-f^-1/3 bi(- ) + b_+^(v)(e)&=&f^-1/3 ai(- ) + a_-^(u)(e)&= & ( bi^(- ) + g f^-1/3 bi(- ) ) + b_-^(u)(e)&=&- ( ai^(- ) + g f^-1/3 ai(- ) ) + a_-^(v)(e)&=&-f^-1/3 bi(- ) + b_-^(v)(e)&=&f^-1/3 ai(- ) [ atomcoeff ] taylor expanding in @xmath38 leads to a more explicit expression for the spectral function : ( e)&= & + & & -2 cm ( - )      it is well known that perturbation theory for an unstable quasi - bound state produces a divergent non - alternating series , with which an imaginary part can be associated using borel techniques .",
    "this was first explicitly investigated for the unstable @xmath95 anharmonic potential @xcite , then in extensive detail for the @xmath96 potential @xcite , and is a very general property of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the same ideas apply to the stark effect problem , as has been investigated exhaustively for atomic systems @xcite .",
    "the quasi - bound states correspond to poles of the spectral function , namely solutions to ^2+^2=0 [ atompoles ] the real part of the quasi - energy can be found by making a perturbative expansion for the real part , @xmath97 , of the energy e_real",
    "=- g^2_n=0^a_n ( ) ^2n [ atompt ] as in ( [ ptenergy ] ) . when the field strength @xmath3 vanishes , there is a single ( even ) bound state at @xmath98 .",
    "thus , @xmath99 , as is consistent with ( [ lead ] ) when @xmath93 .",
    "the width of the quasi - bound state can be estimated by writing e = e_real + i e_imag where we expect @xmath100 to be exponentially small .",
    "indeed , expanding the imaginary part of ( [ atompoles ] ) immediately leads to the leading behavior e_imag~- g^2 [ atomimag ] in agreement with the @xmath93 limit of the molecular case ( [ width ] ) .",
    "we now show how this is consistent with an analysis of the divergence of the perturbative expansion for the real part of the quasi - bound energy level .",
    "first , note that the @xmath101 term in ( [ atompoles ] ) is exponentially small in the small @xmath3 limit , and so can be neglected .",
    "thus the real part is determined by ai(_n=0^a_n ( ) ^2n ) bi(_n=0^a_n ( ) ^2n ) = [ atomcondition ] in the small @xmath3 limit we can use the asymptotic expansions ( [ airyaasymptotic],[airybasymptotic ] ) of the airy functions to make an expansion of ( [ atomcondition ] ) in powers of @xmath102 , thereby successively determining the coefficients @xmath103 .",
    "it is trivial to program this expansion in _ mathematica _ , and the results for the first 21 expansion coefficients are shown in table 1 @xcite .",
    ".this table lists the coefficients @xmath103 appearing in the perturbative expansion ( ) for the quasi - energy level fo the atomic system in an electric field .",
    "note that these coefficients are non - alternating in sign , and that their magnitude , @xmath104 $ ] , grows very fast with the perturbative order @xmath105 , as is shown in the third column .",
    "the fourth column shows the ratio of the @xmath103 to the leading factorial growth rate in ( ) , and the fifth column gives the fourth - order richardson extrapolation @xcite of this ratio , showing its rapid approach to unity .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notice that all the @xmath103 have the same sign , and their magnitude grows very rapidly .",
    "in fact , the leading growth rate at large orders @xmath105 of the perturbation series is factorially fast : a_n^(lead)=()^2n(2n ) [ leading ] the last two columns of table 1 show how quickly this leading growth rate is achieved .",
    "the final column uses fourth order richardson extrapolation @xcite for the ratio of the exact coefficients to the leading behavior in ( [ leading ] ) , and the rapid onset to the leading growth shows that after 10 terms one is already well and truly into the asymptotic regime described by ( [ leading ] ) .",
    "since the perturbative series ( [ atompt ] ) for the energy is divergent and non - alternating , it is not borel summable @xcite .",
    "however , one can associate an imaginary part with such a divergent series using standard borel dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "this technique provides a bridge between perturbative and nonperturbative physics , and is well studied in a wide variety of physics contexts @xcite .",
    "the argument can be motivated and illustrated roughly as follows .",
    "consider the following _ alternating _ divergent series obtained by an asymptotic expansion of the integral _",
    "0^ ~_n=0^ ( -1)^n c^2n(2n ) [ borel ] where @xmath106 .",
    "the integral on the left - hand - side of ( [ borel ] ) is the borel sum of the alternating divergent series of the right - hand - side .",
    "this argument does not work for the corresponding nonalternating series , @xmath107 , as one would encounter a pole on the @xmath108 integration axis .",
    "the behavior at such a pole must be defined by some sort of prescription .",
    "the standard principal parts prescription associates with this non - alternating divergent series a non - perturbative imaginary part @xcite ( _ n=0^c^2n(2n ) ) ~ [ pp ] thus , using the leading growth rate ( [ leading ] ) for the perturbative coefficients @xmath103 we see that this borel approach associates an imaginary part for the quasi - bound energy level equal to ( e)~-g^2 this agrees precisely with the imaginary part ( [ atomimag ] ) found directly from the properties of the airy functions , as well as with a simple wkb estimate .",
    "in this paper we have presented the exact analytic solution for the spectral function for the simple one - dimensional molecular ionization model of a diatomic molecule represented by two attractive delta function wells in an external static electric field .",
    "the weyl - titchmarsh - kodaira spectral theorem provides a simple construction for the spectral function in terms of suitably normalized solutions to the schrdinger equation . in this case",
    "these solutions are airy functions , and the spectral function can be expressed in closed form in terms of airy functions .",
    "thus , the spectral function can easily be plotted using a program such as _ mathematica _ @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the spectral function on the relevant physical parameters , the field strength @xmath3 , the well strength @xmath0 , and the well separation parameter @xmath6 , is illustrated in section 4 by a collection of plots .",
    "this helps develop a body of intuition for the behavior of the quasi - bound states as they are stark shifted and broadened , and also for the resonance structures in the `` continuum '' , which reflect a competition between ramsauer - townsend resonant scattering between the two atomic wells and between one or both atomic well(s ) and the linear field potential .",
    "the most important extension of this model would be to consider the effect of time - dependence in the background electric field , which introduces yet another physical scale into the problem @xcite .",
