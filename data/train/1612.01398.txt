    "the study of interstellar hydrides has received a great push in the recent years , much of it due to observations made from the _ herschel space observatory_. having relatively large rotational constants , many rotational transitions of hydrides lie in the millimiter- and sub - millimitr wave regions , which are difficult , albeit not impossible , to access from ground - based observatories , even for sites as good as those of alma or apex . since hydrides are some of the first molecules to form in space from atomic gas and molecular hydrogen , they provide invaluable information about the environment in which they are found @xcite .",
    "among some of the recent molecules identified in _ herschel _ s spectra are the chlorine - bearing compounds h@xmath1cl@xmath0 @xcite and hcl@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the related hcl neutral had already been identified in the interstellar medium by @xcite .",
    "h@xmath1cl@xmath0 has later been detected in a variety of lines of sight @xcite , both in absorption and emission , also from _ herschel _ s spectra , and in an extragalactic source in alma spectra @xcite .",
    "the only published detection of hcl@xmath0 that we are aware of is that reported by @xcite in the line of sight of the luminous continuum sources w49n and w31c near the galactic center .",
    "the key chemical pathways leading to the formation and destruction of chlorine - containing molecules in the insterstellar medium ( ism ) are described in @xcite and references therein .",
    "succinctly , since the ionization potential of cl is 12.8 ev , slightly lower that that of h , chlorine is mostly in ionized form in the diffuse medium , and it is known to react exothermically with h@xmath1 to form hcl@xmath0 .",
    "further reaction with h@xmath1 forms h@xmath1cl@xmath0 , which can produce neutral hcl or cl upon electron recombination .",
    "chemical models @xcite predict the highest concentrations of hcl@xmath0 in regions with low extinction @xmath2 ) , with molecular h@xmath1 accounting for less than 1 % of the available h.    the identification of hcl@xmath0 by @xcite , relied on the calculated transition frequencies and hyperfine patterns derived from a dunham - type isotope - independent fit of two sets of laboratory data @xcite : the first one was an extensive set of vis - uv emission measurements @xcite comprising more that 8000 transitions in the @xmath3 band of all isotopologues . the precision of those lines was @xmath4 @xmath5 , and the spectral resolution was too low to provide any information on the hyperfine structure ( hfs ) . the second set of data @xcite provided 34 accurate frequencies in the millimiter - wave region , resolving the chlorine hyperfine patterns of three rotational transitions for h@xmath6cl@xmath0 and h@xmath7cl@xmath0 .",
    "this allowed @xcite to perform a joint analysis of both sets of data yielding highly accurate predictions , enough to identify the hcl@xmath0 transitions in _ herschel _ s spectra .",
    "however , the fit did not contain any rotationally resolved data from vibrational transitions in the ground state . adding that information to the global fit",
    "will improve the accuracy of the predictions of the model for other transitions and may facilitate possible observations in the future in the infrared ( ir ) region of the spectrum .",
    "indeed , ir observations from ground platforms at high spectral resolution are a way to build up in the study of interstellar hydrides , providing an alternative and complementary tool to the millimiter and sub - millimeter observations , especially now that the _ herschel _ mission is over .",
    "the instrument great onboard sofia covers the frequency region of the lowest - frequency rotational transitions of h@xmath6cl@xmath0 and h@xmath7cl@xmath0 , although telluric lines at 1441.1 and 1444.0 ghz overlap some of the hyperfine components of the transitions and might hinder the observations . nevertheless , there are current observation programs of hcl@xmath0 with great toward sgr b2 ( m ) , w31c ( g10.6 - 0.4 ) , g29.96 - 0.02 , w49n , w51 , w3(oh ) , and ngc6334i @xcite .",
    "in this paper we provide a set of accurate wavenumbers for vibration - rotation transitions of the @xmath8 band of h@xmath6cl@xmath0 and h@xmath7cl@xmath0 in the mid - ir , as well as an extended and improved fit with millimeter - wave , optical and ir data .",
    "there is one previous laboratory ir study by diode laser spectroscopy , described in a preliminary note @xcite , where 20 fine transitions of h@xmath6cl@xmath0 and 13 fine transitions of h@xmath7cl@xmath0 , were measured with an uncertainty of @xmath9 @xmath5 .",
    "the limited number of observations was most likely due to the patchy coverage of lead salt diode lasers . on account of the much more extensive and accurate set of wavenumbers obtained in this investigation ,",
    "those results have not been included in the present work .",
    "the apparatus used in this experiment is basically the same that has been used recently for the investigation of the ir spectra of nh@xmath10d@xmath0 and arh@xmath0 ions @xcite .",
    "it is based on an ir difference - frequency laser spectrometer , a hollow - cathode discharge reactor , and a double modulation technique with phase - sensitive detection .",
    "the only major change with respect to those previous works is the substitution of the linbo@xmath10 crystal for a mgo - doped periodically poled linbo@xmath10 chip with different poling periods , covering without gaps the 1900 - 4300 @xmath5region when pumped by the 514 nm line of an ar@xmath0 laser , and providing significantly more ir power than our previous setup ( @xmath11 mw vs. @xmath12w . )",
    "the accuracy and repeatability of the frequency scale rely on the active frequency locking of the ar@xmath0 laser to an hyperfine transition of @xmath13i@xmath1 , and a high - accuracy wavemeter , calibrated with the same laser , resulting in a 3@xmath14 accuracy of 10 mhz ( 3.3@xmath15 @xmath5 ) in the ir frequency scale .",
    "the instrumental resolution is @xmath16 mhz ( 10@xmath17 @xmath5 ) , so the observed linewidths are limited by the doppler effect .    in most of the experiments , the cathode was water - cooled , although , in a second step , some lines were recorded again using a flow of liquid nitrogen . a thermocouple resting at the mid - point of the cathode read @xmath18330 and @xmath18180 k , respectively , under discharge conditions .",
    "the plasma was operated in a flow of hcl diluted in he , passed through a dry - ice / ethanol trap to remove possible water traces .",
    "the strongest signals were obtained with a partial pressure of he of 1.2 mbar , and a partial pressure of hcl below the resolution of the available capacitance pressure meter ( 0.001 mbar ) .",
    "the discharge current was 325 ma , with 400 v rms between electrodes .",
    "the rest of operating conditions are similar to those reorted in @xcite .",
    "line positions were calculated with the polynomial expressions given by @xcite , that do not account for any hyperfine splitting , and later they were taken from the prediction available at the jpl database @xcite , entry c036005 , with frequencies for all hyperfine components .",
    "the accuracy was high enough to find the lines within less than 0.02 @xmath5from their expected positions . between 6 and 200 scans",
    "were averaged for each line , depending on its intensity , attaining signal - to - noise ratios between 10 and 500 .",
    "the investigated region spanned the 2337 - 2774 @xmath5interval .",
    "atmospheric co@xmath1 absorption hampered the detection at lower frequencies ( higher-@xmath19 lines in the @xmath20-branch ) , and we kept a similar @xmath21 range for the @xmath22-branch .",
    "no attempt was made to cancel the earth s magnetic field in the experiments ( 44.6 @xmath23 t in madrid ) , since the calculation of zeeman energies by @xcite showed a worst - case splitting ( that of the @xmath24 lines ) of only 3 mhz , much smaller than their doppler width .",

    "these lines split into multiplets due to the hfs of the levels ( @xmath45 ) arising from the interaction with the cl nucleus spin . in low-@xmath19 transitions ,",
    "the hfs is clearly evident , although not completely resolvable , and its amplitude rapidly diminishes as @xmath19 increases .",
    "figure [ fig : figf]a shows an example of lines where the hyperfine components can not be resolved due to their proximity and the doppler broadening of the lines . in turn , figure [ fig : figf]b shows the @xmath46 line of h@xmath6cl@xmath0 line recorded at @xmath47 k , where the hfs is almost completely resolved .",
    "there are intermediate cases where the hfs manifests as broadening or asymmetries of the lines , an example is shown in figure [ fig : figf]c . in this case , both @xmath27 and @xmath28 components of the @xmath48 line of h@xmath7cl@xmath0 overlap , and , together with the hfs , yield a complex , unresolved asymmetric profile . the same line in the @xmath30 ladder is split into @xmath27 and @xmath28 components , also with an asymmetric profile ( the @xmath28 component is outside the frequency range of the figure ) .",
    "it must be noted that the proton hfs could not be resolved in the thz study by @xcite . in the present work , we access lines more sensitive to this interaction , but , as could be expected from the larger doppler widths and the magnitude of the splittings predicted by theory @xcite , we have not been able to resolve it either , and only the cl hyperfine interaction has been considered .    from the line width of a gaussian profile fitted to unresolved transitions with negligible hfs broadening ,",
    "we have obtained kinetic temperatures of @xmath49 k for the spectra recorded with water cooling , and @xmath50 k for those with liquid nitrogen cooling .",
    "the ratio of intensities of different @xmath19 lines under rotational equilibrium is also in agreement with this estimation .",
    "the ratio of intensities of lines with the same @xmath19 in @xmath51 leads to a much higher spin temperature , near @xmath52 k , as can be inferred from the higher intensity of the @xmath30 lines as compared with the calculations assuming boltzmann equilibrium in figures [ fig : figf]a and [ fig : figf]c .",
    "this is not surprising since there is no reason to expect an equilibrium between rotational , vibrational , or spin temperatures in a plasma .",
    "moreover , @xcite also observed a high spin temperature , and the emission data from @xcite showed vibrational excitation up to @xmath53 .",

    "the full hamiltonian and its mass and magnetic relationships among parameters are described in the appendix of @xcite , in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "note that in @xcite the signs should be reversed in the definition of @xmath148 parameters involving @xmath149 and @xmath150 related terms , and that the two rightmost factors in equations a4 and a5 should be removed .",
    "the new fit increases the number of fitted lines from 8137 to 8324 ( 8103 lines from the optical data from @xcite ; 34 lines from @xcite and 187 lines from this work ) .",
    "the present data were weighted according to their estimated uncertainty .",
    "lines that showed no significant broadening or asymmetries were fitted to gaussian profiles to obtain the line center , while for clearly asymmetric lines the centroid frequency was used .",
    "some blends were appropriately intensity weighted and severely blended lines , where @xmath151 components could not be resolved , were not used . the new assignments , observed and calculated frequencies , and their residuals are shown in table [ tab : linelist ] .    the present high - precision data , together with the high - precision thz data of @xcite , provide anchor points for an improved analysis of the molecular parameters for the @xmath31 state , which are shown in table [ tab : dunham_parameters ] as determined by @xcite and presently",
    "the precision of many of the dunham parameters is improved , especially the higher - order @xmath152 terms that were previously completely dependent on the optical data . unlike some of the more heavily correlated parameters associated with the spin - orbit distortion and electron - spin rotation ,",
    "the @xmath149 and @xmath150 terms from the prior analysis do not deviate much outside the prior uncertainty ( all less than 1.1@xmath14 ) .",
    "the precision afforded by the new data refines these values by factors of 6.1 and 7.3 for @xmath141 and @xmath153 , respectively , and by factors of 2.0 and 1.5 for @xmath154 and @xmath155 , respectively .",
    "the most dramatically modified parameters in the present fit are , not surprisingly , the most heavily correlated ones , @xmath131 and @xmath138 , which change by about 7 - 8@xmath14 outside the previously determined error bars .",
    "the changes stem from the new sensitivity to the @xmath139 parameter , which changes by about 4@xmath14 outside its prior uncertainty and is determined 13@xmath156 more precisely .",
    "the combined changes in @xmath138 and @xmath139 produce the anti - correlated change in @xmath157 , which is then further removed from its near equivalence with @xmath141 and thus implies that hcl@xmath0 is less consistent with the pure - precession hypothesis , but only by 3% .",
    "the basic dunham parameters and the associated bob terms are fairly stable upon addition of the higher fidelity vibrational data .",
    "this is seen in @xmath158 and @xmath159 , which can be very sensitive to changes in the vibrational data set , but here only change by @xmath1601.5@xmath14 .",
    "this indicates that the previous data set achieved a broad enough scope in vibration and mass to accurately determine these subtle effects",
    ". however , higher - order terms in the dunham model remain susceptible to the breadth and scope of the data and statistically significant changes occur in many of these terms . the only other parameters to have changed by more that 3@xmath14 of its prior uncertainty are @xmath123 and @xmath128 , which appear to have correlated ( and anti - correlated ) commensurate changes with @xmath159 , which is not outside of 3@xmath14 of the prior uncertainty due to the larger uncertainty in that parameter .",
    "due to correlation , any improvement in the precision of these two parameters is not obvious .",
