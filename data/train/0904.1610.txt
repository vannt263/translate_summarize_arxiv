    ", there is a clear inner bubble , and with the combined dataset , an outer bubble is seen to the nw .",
    "the s bubble now appears to be split into an inner and outer bubble , with the outer bubble to the se .",
    "these outer bubbles may be ghost bubbles arising from a previous outburst by the agn .",
    "the radio lobe emission from the agn fills the outer bubbles and the spectral index steepens in these regions ( zhao et al .",
    "bright shells surround the inner bubbles , and a filament extends from the n bright shell to the agn .",
    "this was found previously to be associated with h-@xmath10 emission ( blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) , and this feature is now revealed to extend much closer to the agn .    3.0truein    0.2truein    an unsharp - masked ( 0.310 kev ) image of a2052 is shown in figure 2 with a slightly larger field of view than the image shown in figure 1 .",
    "it was created by dividing an image smoothed with a 0.98 arcsec gaussian by an image smoothed with a 9.8 arcsec gaussian .",
    "the features described above and visible in figure 1 are also seen in the unsharp - masked image , sometimes more clearly .",
    "the outer bubbles are revealed more prominently and ripple - like surface - brightness discontinuities are seen surrounding the cluster center , with two discontinuities visible most clearly to the ne of the agn .",
    "to investigate the nature of the surface brightness discontinuities , we have fitted a spherically symmetric density model , including three power - law components with two discontinuities to a ne sector of the cluster and determined the jumps in density that are represented by these surface brightness changes .",
    "the ne sector has an opening angle of 100@xmath11 ( position angles @xmath12 to @xmath13 from n ) .",
    "the fitted model is shown with the emission measure profile in fig .",
    "the emission measure was calculated using projected spectral fits , and is fairly insensitive to temperature . assuming a constant temperature , rather than fitting for the temperature in each region , changes the emission measure values by @xmath14 .",
    "the best - fitting model is an excellent fit with @xmath15 for 22 d.o.f .",
    "a single density jump model does not provide a good fit with @xmath16 for 25 d.o.f .",
    ", nor does a model without a jump . with the best - fitting model ,",
    "two jumps in density are found , at radii of 45 and 67 arcsec ( 31 and 46 kpc ) from the agn , coincident with the surface - brightness edges .",
    "the power - law indices for the three components are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , going from the center of the cluster outward .",
    "the inner density jump is a factor of @xmath19 and the outer density jump is a factor of @xmath20 .",
    "these density discontinuities are consistent with shocks with mach numbers of @xmath21 for the 31 kpc feature and @xmath22 for the 46 kpc feature .",
    "the inner feature was briefly noted in blanton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and our mach number is consistent with the limit found in the earlier paper .",
    "the very similar mach numbers for the two shocks may indicate that the feedback cycle for a2052 is regular , with similar amounts of energy injected into the cluster with each outburst of the radio source . for each shock , we would expect the temperature to jump by a factor of 1.2 .    3.1truein    0.2truein      in order to examine the temperature structure near the potential shock regions as well as in the cluster center in general , we generated a temperature map . the tessellated temperature map is shown in figure  [ fig : vtmap ] .",
    "each bin was fitted using only counts from that area , so the extraction regions are well - defined and do not overlap .",
    "the bins were generated using the algorithm provided by diehl & statler ( 2006 ) , which is a generalization of cappellari & copin s ( 2003 ) voronoi binning algorithm , and requiring roughly 1100 net counts per bin ( see randall et al .",
    "2008 for more details ) .",
    "each bin was fitted in the @xmath23 kev energy range with an apec thermal plasma model with temperature and abundance allowed to vary , and absorption fixed at the galactic value of @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "the color bar gives the best fit temperaures in kev .",
    "no sharp rise in temperature is seen associated with either of the jumps in surface brightness corresponding to the shock regions . in general , the cluster is coolest at the center with the bright shells of emission surrounding the bubbles exhibiting the coolest temperatures , @xmath26 kev .",
    "2.5truein    0.2truein    we have measured the projected temperature profile in the same ne sector used for the emission measure profile .",
    "the fits were performed using the apec model , as described above .",
    "the profile is shown as the solid points in the upper panel of fig .",
    "5 . as in the temperature map ,",
    "no large jumps in temperature are seen inside with the shocks , indicated with dashed lines in fig .",
    "profiles of density and pressure are also shown in fig .",
    "the density was determined by deprojecting the surface brightness profile , assuming that the emissivity is constant in spherical shells .",
    "we use the method described recently in wong et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and also in kriss et al .",
    "since the surface brightness is proportional to @xmath27 , the density is not a very sensitive function of the temperature .",
    "we have used our projected spectral fits when calculating the conversion from count rate to flux , which is used in combination with the surface brightness deprojection to determine the density . as a comparison , we have also calculated the density directly from the deprojected spectral fits , using the projected volume at each radius , and find that the density values agree to within @xmath14 with those calculated by deprojecting the surface brightness . however , since the errors in the spectral fits ( both for the temperatures and normalizations ) are much larger for the deprojected spectra , the errors in the density values are much larger in this case .    the temperature map in fig .  4 and the temperature profile ( solid points ) in fig .  5 both",
    "display projected temperatures , and so include the contribution of gas along the line - of - sight to the gas at the radii of interest , in the vicinity of the shocks .",
    "this projection can make it more difficult to detect any temperature rise that may be associated with the shocks .",
    "we have therefore performed a spectral deprojection for the ne sector .",
    "the spectrum for the outermost annulus was fitted with a model including galactic absorption and an apec model , with temperature and abundance allowed to vary .",
    "the next annulus in was then fitted with a model including the best fit from the outermost annulus with the normalization scaled to account for the projection of this outer annulus onto the current annulus being fitted .",
    "parameters from the outer annulus fit were frozen and another apec component was added for the current annulus .",
    "spectra were fitted in this manner for each annulus , including the fits from all exterior annuli properly scaled and frozen .",
    "see blanton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for further description of this technique .",
    "the temperatures resulting from the deprojection are shown as the open circles in the upper panel of fig .",
    "5 . in addition",
    ", we have used the deprojected temperatures to recalculate the pressures , shown as the open circles in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "5 .    with the spectral deprojection , for the inner shock , the best fitting pre - shock temperature is @xmath28 kev and the post - shock temperature is @xmath29 kev . for the outer shock , these values are @xmath30 kev and @xmath31 kev , respectively . therefore , for the inner shock ,",
    "the temperatures are consistent with a rise inside the shock by a factor as large as 1.2 , and for the outer shock this value is as large as 1.3 . in both cases , then , the temperatures inside and outside the shocks are consistent with what is predicted for shocks with mach number 1.2 ( a temperature rise with a factor of 1.2 ) .",
    "while the temperatures we measure in the density jump regions are consistent , within the errors , with what is expected with a shock model , the best - fitting temperatures are approximately constant across the jumps .",
    "if a temperature rise is not seen associated with a potential shock , the abrupt change in density may be due to an isothermal shock or a cold front .",
    "possible isothermal shocks have been seen in perseus ( fabian et al .",
    "2006 , mach 1.26 ) as well as the clusters a2199 and 2a 0335 + 096 ( sanders & fabian 2006 , both mach 1.5 ) .",
    "this may indicate that thermal conduction is efficient in these regions .",
    "however , a lack of an observed rise in temperature may also result from adiabatic expansion and orientation effects ( mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) .",
    "cold fronts typically display a sharp change in density in one direction ( see markevitch & vikhlinin 2007 for a review ) , and are not usually seen to extend 360@xmath11 around the center of a cluster .",
    "the outer density jump feature is much sharper and less extended to the ne than to the sw and could be associated with a cold front related to either a merger or sloshing of the cd galaxy .",
    "the inner jump feature extends 360@xmath11 around the center of the cluster and is probably more likely associated with a shock .",
    "however , this geometry could be possible if there were a cold front occurring along our line - of - sight .",
    "the central cd galaxy has a fairly large peculiar velocity of @xmath32 km s@xmath4 relative to the cluster mean ( oegerle & hill 2001 ) , which could be related to merger activity along our line - of - sight possibly producing a cold front .        we have calculated an average sound speed of 820 km s@xmath4 in the central region of the cluster based on a temperature of @xmath33 kev .",
    "if we assume the two density jump features are shocks , we can calculate a cycle time for the radio source ( where the cycle time is the interval between outbursts ) .",
    "the outer shock is at a projected distance of 46 kpc from the agn and the estimated speed , based on the mach number above , is 980 km / s .",
    "the inner shock is at a projected distance of 31 kpc from the agn , and the estimated speed for this feature is 970 km / s .",
    "if the shocks are due to a series of outbursts from the radio source , their positions and speeds of propagation imply a cycle time of @xmath34 yr .",
    "a similar cycle time was inferred from the perseus data from measuring the ripple separation ( fabian et al .",
    "this time is only slightly longer than the synchrotron radio age of the lobes in abell 2052 ( @xmath35 yr , zhao et al .",
    "we can also estimate the cycle time using the locations of the ghost cavities and assuming that they rose buoyantly at some fraction of the local sound speed . using the se ghost cavity , we estimate a cycle time of approximately @xmath36 yr ( @xmath37 yr ) if the cavities rose at 0.5 times ( 1 times ) the local sound speed , roughly consistent with our estimate from the shock features .    fitting a cooling flow model ( including galactic absorption and an extra thermal apec model to account for overlying gas ) to the cluster spectra within a radius of 137@xmath38 = 95 kpc yields a mass deposition rate of @xmath39 yr@xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to a cooling luminosity of @xmath40 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "heating from the central agn can come in the form of shock heating as well as buoyantly rising bubbles inflated by the radio lobes .",
    "if the density jump features represent shocks , we may calculate the shock heating per unit volume using @xmath41 where p is the pre - shock pressure , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the time interval between shocks ( mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) . for the inner shock ,",
    "using the pre - shock pressure of @xmath44 dyn @xmath25 , and the expected pressure jump of a factor of 1.55 , we find @xmath45 erg @xmath46 s@xmath4 , or an energy input rate of @xmath47 erg s@xmath4 within the spherical volume interior to the inner shock using the cycle time calculated from the potential shock feature separation of @xmath48 yr .",
    "therefore , energy input from the shocks may contribute to heating , but falls short by a factor of approximately five of offsetting the cooling .",
    "we may also estimate the energy input from buoyantly rising bubbles . here",
    ", the heat input comes from the work done in inflating the bubbles and the energy content of any gas within the bubbles , @xmath49 ( churazov et al .",
    "2002 ) , using @xmath42 . using the pressure in the bubble rims of @xmath50 dyn @xmath25 ,",
    "computing the n and s bubble volumes using a bubble radius of @xmath51 = 7.2 kpc , and using the cycle time inferred from the outer bubble positions of @xmath36 yr ( @xmath52 yr ) , we find an energy input rate of @xmath53 erg s@xmath4 ( @xmath54 erg s@xmath4 ) .",
    "if we assume that the bubbles are filled with relativistic plasma ( @xmath55 ) then @xmath56 ( churazov et al .",
    "2002 ) and the energy input rate is slightly higher , @xmath57 erg s@xmath4 ( @xmath58 erg s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the combination of direct shock heating and energy input from buoyantly rising bubbles can then offset the cooling of the gas in the center of a2052 .",
