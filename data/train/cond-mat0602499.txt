    "currently , the development of techniques for coherent manipulation and control of electron spins in semiconductor nanostructures is an area of vibrant research activity .",
    "such techniques are needed for many coherent spintronic devices @xcite , such as a datta - das transistor @xcite , and for quantum computing using the spin of an electron in a quantum dot ( qd ) as a qubit @xcite .",
    "however , the decoherence time of an electron spin constitutes a fundamental obstacle on the way to realization of a qd - based quantum computation @xcite . in order to enhance the coherence time ,",
    "a quantum memory protocol has been recently suggested @xcite which allows mapping of the quantum state of the electron spin on the collective spin of the nuclei present in the qd , thereby taking advantage of the intrinsically longer coherence times of nuclear spins . under ideal circumstances ,",
    "the proposed scheme allows to encode and , at later time , to retrieve , the electron spin state with near 100% reliability .",
    "furthermore , it can be extended to implementing arbitrary 1- and 2-qubit operations @xcite .",
    "imperfections , which should be expected in realistic settings , lead to errors , thus deteriorating the fidelity of the quantum memory protocol @xcite .",
    "some errors can be reduced @xcite , but some are inherent to the protocol , such as the incomplete polarization of the nuclear spins and the spread in the hyperfine interactions between the electron and the nuclei in the qd . in this work ,",
    "we use numerical simulations @xcite to analyze the effect of these errors on the performance of the quantum memory protocol .",
    "we show that the scheme remains feasible for the spin bath polarizations exceeding 80% , with the minimum fidelity of @xmath0% .",
    "first , let us recall the scheme of ref .  .",
    "the electron with a spinor wave function @xmath1 is injected into an empty quantum dot , and starts interacting with the bath of @xmath2 nuclear spins in the dot .",
    "the most important part of this interaction is the isotropic contact hyperfine coupling .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system , taking into account the zeeman energy of the electron spin in the external field @xmath3 , becomes @xmath4 where @xmath5=1/2 is the electron spin , @xmath6 are the spins of the nuclei ( the fact that the nuclear spins of ga and as are not 1/2 is not important here , up to renormalization of the appropriate parameters , and we will consider them as spin-1/2 in the following discussion ) , and @xmath7 is the contact coupling determined by the electron density @xmath8 at the site @xmath9 of @xmath10-th bath spin , and by the land factors @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the magnetons @xmath13 , @xmath14 of the electron and the nuclei , respectively . at maximum polarization , the nuclei can produce an effective field @xmath15 tesla @xcite .    other terms in the hamiltonian ( [ hamt ] ) can be omitted when discussing the storage and retrieval processes due to their smallness at the relevant timescales .",
    "these are , e.g. , the zeeman energy of the nuclear spins , the dipolar coupling between the bath spins , or between the electron spin and the bath spins .",
    "also , we assume that the injection is performed quickly , so that the approximation of the sudden change of the hamiltonian is applicable , and neither the state of the bath nor the state of the electron spin are affected by the injection process .",
    "alternatively , fast control of the zeeman splitting of the electron allows for the electron spin - nuclear spin system to be brought into resonance in a sudden approximation , and is similar in nature to the controlled injection / ejection of electrons from the quantum dot .",
    "if the electronic wave function were spread uniformly over the dot volume , making all @xmath16 equal to @xmath17 , and if the nuclear spins were completely polarized ( i.e. , if the bath were in the state @xmath18 ) then , for the external field adjusted to be @xmath19 , the motion of the compound system ( the electron and the bath spins ) would become a sinusoidal oscillation between the states @xmath20 and @xmath21 $ ] where @xmath22 ( @xmath2 is the number of the nuclei in the dot ) .",
    "thus , after half - period of such oscillations , the initial state of the electron spin becomes encoded in the state of the bath , and the electron can be ejected from the quantum dot . in order to retrieve this information after some time",
    ", another electron in the state @xmath23 can be injected , and after a half - period of the oscillations , the state of the electron spin is again @xmath24 .",
    "of course , for this two - step scheme to work , the delay between the information encoding and retrieval should be small in comparison with the characteristic times of the omitted terms in the hamiltonian ( in practice , these terms should be reduced using , e.g. , nmr techniques @xcite ) .    however , real baths are incompletely polarized and the approximation of complete polarization is _ never _ applicable to a real bath with @xmath25 . to explain this ,",
    "let us consider a highly polarized state of the bath described by a density matrix @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is chosen such that @xmath29 .",
    "for such a bath , the polarization is @xmath30 , and for large @xmath31 the value of @xmath32 is very small .",
    "however , the statistical weight @xmath33 of the states with a given value @xmath34 of @xmath35 is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , the integer @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is a binomial coefficient .",
    "the distribution @xmath33 is approximately gaussian centered at @xmath40 with the rms @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , unless @xmath42 is unrealistically small ( @xmath43 ) , a very large number of the bath states are involved in the time evolution , as opposed to only two states @xmath44 and @xmath45 involved in the case of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "all these states have different oscillations frequencies , and form complex time - dependent superpositions , so that the fidelity of the information encoding and retrieval is reduced .",
    "the errors associated with @xmath48 ( incomplete polarization ) and @xmath49 ( spread in the hyperfine couplings ) are intrinsic to the protocol .",
    "curiously , the symmetry properties of the spin interaction allows for some correction , by state engineering and spin - echo techniques , for these errors @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we consider qualitatively the analytical behavior of the storage protocol when inhomogeneity is negligible ( @xmath50 ) but polarization is less than perfect , and indicate how many of the effects of different oscillation frequencies and hilbert space dimension lead to only moderate decreases in the fidelity of storage and retrieval .",
    "we then evaluate the same situation numerical in section iii , and develop the useful measures of performance for the protocol . in section iv ,",
    "the numerical results are extended to the case of inhomogeneous interaction ( @xmath51 ) , and then in section v the minimal fidelity of the protocol ( minimized over all possible electron spin states ) is calculated .",
    "as indicated above  @xcite , for @xmath46 and @xmath48 the fidelity of the quantum memory protocol remains high if @xmath53 , even for @xmath54 .",
    "it is instructive to understand this robustness in detail .    to grasp the idea ,",
    "let us consider only the first , encoding , step .",
    "we note that for @xmath46 , the total spin of the nuclear bath @xmath55 is an integral of motion .",
    "if the initial state of the bath is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the value of @xmath55 and @xmath58 is the value of @xmath35 , then the time - dependent wave function of the compound system is @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are defined similarly ) .",
    "the relevant matrix elements are @xmath66    the oscillation frequencies @xmath67 are strongly dependent on both @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for the bath s initial density matrix @xmath26 , the statistical weight for the state @xmath56 is @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are integers , and @xmath71 is a binomial coefficient . for @xmath53 , both @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    "are small ( note that @xmath74 , so that @xmath10 is close to @xmath2 ) , and for a given @xmath58 , it is easy to see that @xmath75 . the main contribution to the evolution comes only from the states with @xmath76 , and the states with larger values of @xmath77 have too small a weight to impact the oscillations , and , correspondingly , to reduce the fidelity .",
    "thus , the distribution of the frequencies @xmath67 in eq .  [ oscills ] is determined only by @xmath78 , and a spread of the oscillation frequencies @xmath79 is much smaller than the mean frequency @xmath80 .    using eqs .",
    "[ oscills],[wim ] it is easy to obtain an analytical approximation for @xmath81 and @xmath52 in the leading order in @xmath42 ( but uniformly in time ) , since @xmath82 , @xmath83 . for the spin",
    "initially polarized along the @xmath84-axis ( @xmath85 ) , @xmath86 while for the initial `` spin - up '' state , @xmath87 where @xmath88 , and only @xmath89 is influenced in the leading order in @xmath42 .",
    "the difference between the results for transverse ( x ) and parallel ( z ) states indicates that the memory protocol is not isotropic : its performance depends in part upon the spin state being stored . as such",
    ", in analyzing errors , we will consider several different performance measures , described in detail below .",
    "we first consider the reliability of numerical simulations .",
    "we focus on the case of @xmath46 in order to assess reliability of our simulations with @xmath90 ( presented below , performed for the case of @xmath49 ) , and to quantify the fidelity in detail , without omission of higher - order terms in @xmath42 .",
    "the case of @xmath46 is a good check since it allows analytical solution , so that the results for @xmath90 can be directly compared with the results for realistic value @xmath91 .",
    "let us focus first on the encoding step to determine what will be useful performance measures for the protocol . since @xmath92 in eqs .",
    "[ oscills ] , the components @xmath93 , @xmath94 of the electron spin rotate with time in the @xmath84@xmath95 plane with the angular velocity of order of @xmath96 .",
    "this rotation is uniform , and does not depend on the particular values @xmath97 , @xmath98 of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , because the hamiltonian ( [ hamt ] ) is invariant with respect to the rotation in the @xmath84@xmath95 plane ( @xmath99 commutes with @xmath100}$ ] for any @xmath101 ) . as a result , even in perfect situation of @xmath47 , @xmath46 , for the initial value of @xmath102 , the final retrieved value @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "however , this error is noticeable only for relatively small @xmath2 ( @xmath105 ) , since the total time of the interaction of the electron spin with the bath is only one oscillation period , i.e. , roughly @xmath106 , while the angular velocity is of order of @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , this error is easily recoverable by application of a correcting pulse of the external field @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , a physically meaningful measure of errors associated with decoherence of the @xmath93 operator is the total transverse component of the electron spin , @xmath108 which is proportional to @xmath109 if @xmath102 .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a  d ) , where we plotted the oscillations of @xmath97 and @xmath110 for @xmath47 ( left column , ( a ) and ( c ) ) , and for @xmath111 ( right column,(b ) and ( d ) ) , for the initial condition @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",

    "the fact that the latter value is different from 100% is due to the modest number of bath spin @xmath2 . indeed , as seen from eq .",
    "[ analytfid ] , for large @xmath2 , the value of @xmath273 for completely polarized bath differs from unity by the terms of order of @xmath138 , and therefore goes to zero for large @xmath2 .    using the analytical approach described in sec .",
    "[ qualitanalyt ] , we can estimate the minimum fidelity for small @xmath42 in the approximation of all @xmath279 _ const_.",

    "indeed , the analytical calculations of ref .   and section [ s : numerics ] of this paper suggests that at 100% polarization the error arises from the inhomogeneous hyperfine coupling , and hence scales as @xmath292 . while it corresponds to few percent for the simulations presented in fig .  [ fig9 ] ( @xmath90 ) , for realistic dots ( @xmath293 ) , it is well below @xmath294 .",
    "we study numerically the long - lived memory for electronic spin in a quantum dot taking into account the errors inherent in the protocol for a realistic system : the incomplete polarization of the bath of nuclear spins and the spread in the hyperfine interactions between the electron and the nuclei in the quantum dot .",
    "although the imperfections deteriorate the fidelity of the quantum information retrieval , the scheme remains feasible for the spin bath polarizations exceeding 80% , with a minimum fidelity of @xmath295% .",
    "fidelity is determined mostly by the retrieved value of @xmath116 , and increases linearly with increasing polarization of the bath .    since direct simulation of a real system with @xmath296 nuclear spins is currently impossible , we consider the system of @xmath90 spins coupled to the electron spin .",
    "such a step requires justification , and accordingly a major part of our work is devoted to understanding the reliability of our simulations . by comparing different aspects of the numerical calculations with the analytical results , we show that our results give adequate estimates for realistic situations , with a precision of 58% .",
    "the errors considered in this work may be reduced by changes to the storage protocol or altered by considering of more realistic initial conditions .",
