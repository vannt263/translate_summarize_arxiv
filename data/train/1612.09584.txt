    "the manipulation and switching of ordered states by optical pulses is an active research field which connects fundamental theoretical issues to important technological applications .",
    "two decades ago beaurepaire _ et al .",
    "_ showed that short laser pulses can melt the ferromagnetic spin order in ni in less than a picosecond @xcite . in ferrimagnets , such as gd - fe alloys ,",
    "the energy injected by light pulses can result in a switching of the sublattice magnetization @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was shown that the polaronic mott insulator tas@xmath0 can be switched from the insulating commensurate charge density wave phase into a conducting so - called  hidden state \" ( with an unconventional form of charge order ) by applying short laser pulses @xcite .",
    "the investigation of such light - induced switching mechanisms is at least partially motivated by the quest for a fast and energy - efficient memory technology @xcite . over the last decades the performance of memory devices has lagged behind the rapid gains in processing power .",
    "desirable features of a high - performance memory include electrically or optically controlled fast write and erase operations , fast read - out , low energy consumption and a non - volatile nature of the stored information .",
    "ideally , the free energy landscape is characterized by at least two minima corresponding to physically distinct realizations of the order , and the switching between these minima can be accomplished without a transient melting of the order , through the application of a suitable force which rotates the order parameter .",
    "if this rotation furthermore involves no displacement of charge , and does not couple to static lattice distortions , it may be potentially accomplished on a very fast , electronic timescale , and at little energy cost .    while existing memory technologies are based on  conventional \" order parameters such as magnetization or charge order , we will explore in this work a fundamentally different , and rather exotic type of ordered state , which involves a symmetry breaking on the two - particle level (  composite order \" ) .",
    "we will show that this type of order , which has recently been detected in rb@xmath1cs@xmath2c@xmath3 @xcite , and theoretically explained in ref .  , encompasses a range of desirable properties which make it interesting for memory applications .",
    "alkali - doped fulleride compounds have been investigated extensively because of their unconventional form of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "these systems can be described by a half - filled three orbital hubbard model with degenerate bands derived from the t@xmath4 molecular orbitals .",
    "the characteristic and unusual feature of this class of materials is an effectively negative hund coupling , resulting from the overscreening of the small bare hund coupling by jahn - teller phonons @xcite .",
    "such three - orbital systems with negative hund coupling exhibit , in an experimentally relevant range of interactions or pressure , a spontaneous orbital selective mott transition @xcite .",
    "this is a transition into a long - range ordered phase with a composite order parameter , namely an orbital - dependent double occupation . while different types of such orders exist , the most stable one features one metallic and two insulating orbitals .",
    "there are thus three different realizations of this most stable order , which can be distinguished by their conductance anisotropy , and which may be used to store information .",
    "since the spontaneous orbital - selective mott ( sosm ) phase has no ordinary orbital moment , i.e. all three orbitals remain half - filled , this electronic order should not induce static lattice distortions and it may thus be possible to switch it efficiently between the different physical realizations of the order parameter .",
    "alkali - doped fullerides in the sosm phase hence provide a potential platform for ultra - fast and energy efficient persistent memory devices .",
    "the essential physics of alkali doped fullerides is captured by the half - filled three orbital hubbard model with negative hund coupling @xcite .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath5 with @xmath6 the annihilation operator for an electron with spin @xmath7 in orbital @xmath8 at site @xmath9 , @xmath10 the chemical potential , and @xmath11 .",
    "the orbitals are labeled according to their symmetry @xmath12 .",
    "assuming for simplicity nearest - neighbor hopping on a cubic lattice , the symmetry of the orbitals implies that hopping occurs only between orbitals of the same type , with @xmath13 if the nearest - neighbor bond @xmath14 is directed along @xmath8 , and @xmath15 otherwise . note",
    "that this orbital - dependent hopping implies an anisotropic conductance of the sosm phase .",
    "the interaction term @xmath16 is of the slater - kanamori form , @xmath17 and we choose @xmath18 .",
    "this value of @xmath19 is substantially larger than in realistic compounds @xcite , where it is around @xmath20-@xmath21 , but the physics does not depend qualitatively on the value of @xmath22 and the above choice is advantageous from a numerical point of view @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that while the pair - hopping term stabilizes the sosm phase , the composite order also appears in the ising approximation ( @xmath23 ) , so we will first discuss the results for this simpler model .    to describe the laser excitation which is later used to switch between different sosm phases we include an electric field in the model , by multiplying the hopping @xmath24 with a time - dependent peierls factor @xmath25 , where the phase @xmath26 is the projection of the vector potential @xmath27 onto the bond vector @xmath28 , and the vector potential @xmath27 is related to the electric field by @xmath29 .",
    "due to the orbital - dependent anisotropy of the hoppings , one can therefore selectively modify the hoppings for the three orbitals by a suitable choice of the time - dependent polarization of the field , which determines the components @xmath30 along the @xmath8-direction .    to solve the time - dependent lattice problem",
    ", we use the nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory @xcite , which maps the lattice system to an auxiliary three - orbital impurity problem with the same interactions as eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) , subject to a self - consistency condition for the hybridization function . for the orbital - dependent hoppings introduced above",

    "we have also replaced @xmath33}(t , t')$ ] by @xmath38 , which approximates the orbital - dependent local density of states by a semi - ellipse of bandwidth @xmath39 corresponding to an infinitely connected bethe lattice .",
    "we expect that the shape of the density of states does not qualitatively affect the results presented below .",
    "we choose @xmath40 ev in the following , to set this energy scale to a value approximately equal to the bandwidth of a@xmath41c@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the nonequilibrium impurity model is treated with a strong - coupling perturbative impurity solver @xcite .",
    "the latter approach is suitable for the strongly correlated regime that we are interested in , and it can be straightforwardly applied to multiorbital problems by introducing pseudo - particles for each atomic eigenstate @xcite . to enable an efficient simulation",
    ", we have automatized the detection of degeneracies in the large set of self - energy and green function diagrams , which allows us to reach the relevant timescales both at the first order ( non - crossing approximation , nca ) and second order ( one - crossing approximation , oca ) level .",
    "specifically , for the half - filled model with @xmath23 , the symmetry analysis reduces the number of nca self - energy diagrams from 384 to 156 , and the number of nca green function diagrams from 192 to 96 .    to mimic energy dissipation to the lattice and to explore the heating effect on the order parameter dynamics we locally couple a bosonic heat bath to the electrons @xcite",
    "this is done by adding a self - energy of the form @xmath42 to the hybridization function of each orbital , where @xmath43 is the equilibrium propagator of a boson with energy @xmath44 at inverse temperature @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the electron - boson coupling strength @xcite .",
    "we start by briefly discussing the essential properties of the sosm states characterized by a coexistence of insulating and metallic orbitals @xcite . in the model with density - density interactions ( @xmath23 ) , the order is characterized by the quantities @xmath47 and @xmath48 defined as  @xcite @xmath49 here , @xmath50 is the double occupation in orbital @xmath8 . for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 [ @xmath54 ev , @xmath55 ev , @xmath56 k ] ,",
    "the orbital - dependent double occupations in the @xmath57 state are @xmath58 , @xmath59 , while in the @xmath60 state , we find @xmath61 , @xmath62 ( nca results ) . figure  [ figeq ] shows the corresponding orbital - dependent spectral functions .",
    "the @xmath57 state ( left panel ) features two insulating and one metallic orbital .",
    "( since @xmath63 , the insulator is a paired mott insulator , with an enhanced double occupation as compared to the metal , so that @xmath64 . ) in the @xmath60 state ( middle panel ) , the first two orbitals are metallic and in the third orbital the electrons are paired , which results in @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath66 , @xmath67 state is difficult to stabilize in equilibrium .",
    "it has one insulating , one metallic and one bad - metallic orbital , whose spectral function exhibits a narrow gap in the quasi - particle peak . here ,",
    "the double occupations satisfy @xmath68 and @xmath69 . by permuting the orbitals",
    ", we can generate three equivalent @xmath57 and @xmath60 states , and six equivalent @xmath70 states , as illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figeq ] .",
    "all these states can be distinguished by their unique anisotropic conductivity .    in ref .",
    "it was shown that in equilibrium , the @xmath57 state is the stable sosm state , so that in the following , we will focus on the ultrafast switching between the different @xmath57 states , i.e. between states with the following combination of metallic ( @xmath71 ) and insulating ( @xmath72 ) orbitals : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "we found that switching between different sosm states is possible by applying various types of time - dependent perturbations , such as ( i ) time - dependent crystal field splittings , ( ii ) time- and orbital - dependent interactions @xmath77 , and ( iii ) time - dependent electric fields .",
    "protocols of the type ( i ) and , indirectly , ( ii ) may be realized by the selective driving of phonon modes , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "however , such a switching is limited by the intrinsic timescale of the phonons , and it involves ( at least temporarily ) the appearance of ordinary orbital moments . here , we are interested in potentially faster switching protocols , which are limited only by some electronic timescale , and which do not induce any symmetry - breaking at the one - body level . a promising pathway is the direct coupling of the electric field of the laser to the electrons .",
    "static @xcite or periodic @xcite electric fields are known to reduce the effective hopping in systems with well separated low - energy bands , as is the case in a@xmath41c@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "for example , for an oscillating field @xmath78 and in the limit of high - frequencies , the peierls factor can be replaced by its time - average , given by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the bessel function and @xmath37 the lattice spacing . to gain some insights into the switching dynamics , we will therefore first study simplified protocols , in which the _ amplitude _ of the hopping is modified in an orbital and time - dependent way , with the constraint that the orbital - dependent hoppings can only be reduced from their bare values , i.e. , the term @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_field ] ) is replaced by a time - dependent real function @xmath82 . in section [ sec : field ] we will then confirm that a switching can also be achieved by explicitly simulating the electric field , using similar protocols .",
    "figure  [ figswitch ] illustrates a possible switching protocol .",
    "the left panel shows the time evolution of the hopping parameters , the middle panel the resulting evolution of the double occupation and the right panel the rotation of the order parameter in the @xmath83-@xmath84 plane .",
    "since we are manipulating the hopping , it is natural to think of the sosm state as a state with orbital - dependent kinetic energy .",
    "the absolute value of the kinetic energy @xmath85 is reduced for the insulating orbitals and enhanced for the metallic orbital . to switch from @xmath86 to @xmath87",
    ", we first suppress the hopping in orbitals @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this breaks the symmetry between the insulating orbitals and leads to a reduction in the kinetic energy associated with the third orbital .",
    "after about 60 fs , the kinetic energies ( and double occupations ) in orbitals 1 and 3 reach similar values .",
    "if one would turn the hopping back on at this point , one would end up in a @xmath90 state with two metallic and one insulating orbital .",
    "however , since this state is not the thermodynamically most stable one , we instead switch on the hopping in orbital @xmath88 only .",
    "this leads to an increase in @xmath91 and a faster evolution of orbitals @xmath88 and @xmath89 towards an insulating state with @xmath92 and @xmath93 . at the same time",
    ", orbital @xmath94 turns metallic , so that we end up in the stable @xmath87 state .    while especially the second part of the switching protocol leads to a reduction in the magnitude of the order parameter , the latter recovers to the thermal value as energy",
    "is dissipated to the bath , without adverse effect on the stability of the switched state .",
    "the cooling dynamics is evident in the evolution of the double occupation after time @xmath95 fs and in the radial outward drift of the order parameter in the right panel .    to illustrate how the nature of the orbitals changes during the switching , we show in fig .",
    "[ figspectra ] the time evolution of the orbital - resolved local spectral functions .",
    "the latter have been obtained as @xmath96 , with @xmath97 fs @xcite .",
    "the shortest switching time which can be realized depends on several factors , such as the minimal value of the hopping in the switching protocol , the maximum reduction in the order parameter that one is willing to tolerate , and the parameters of the heat bath . for an efficient cooling ,",
    "the boson frequency @xmath44 has to be relatively small , and the boson coupling @xmath46 has to be sufficiently large .",
    "we choose @xmath98 and @xmath99 because these values allow to stabilize sosm states with qualitatively correct features in the spectral functions , and an order parameter switching on numerically accessible timescales @xcite .      in this section",
    "we consider the model with rotationally invariant interaction ( @xmath100 in eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) ) , but otherwise identical parameters . in this case",
    ", the system reacts more strongly to a reduction of the hopping , and the switching between different @xmath57 states is faster than in the model with density - density interaction ( fig .",
    "[ figswitch1 ] ) .",
    "also , after a rapid switching , we observe small amplitude and phase oscillations of the order parameter around the new @xmath57 state .",
    "to excite the amplitude mode directly , we start in the @xmath101 state and quench the hopping for all orbitals to 80% of the initial value at @xmath102 .",
    "( in an experiment , this could be achieved by a strong field pulse with polarization aligned in the body diagonal of the crystal . )",
    "the resulting evolution of @xmath47 is shown in the first panel of fig .",
    "[ fighiggs ] .",
    "it exhibits well - defined , but strongly damped amplitude oscillations . since this symmetric quench",
    "does not excite a phase mode , @xmath48 remains zero during and after the pulse .",
    "to excite both modes , we apply an asymmetric quench , where the hopping in orbital 2 is reduced at @xmath102 and in orbitals 1 and 3 after a time delay of @xmath103 fs .",
    "the resulting dynamics of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 order parameters is shown in the middle panel .",
    "while the initial oscillation period of both modes is similar , it grows for subsequent oscillations in the case of the @xmath47 mode , which indicates that the free energy minimum in the @xmath47 direction becomes shallower due to heating , while it does not change substantially in the @xmath48 direction .",
    "the third panel shows the evolution of the order parameter in the @xmath47-@xmath48 plane , which also illustrates that the period of the two modes drifts apart at later times .      in this final section ,",
    "we show that switching is also possible by simulating the electric field of the laser . in the following",
    ", we will set @xmath104 to a constant and include a field through the peierls phase in eq .  .",
    "we considered two switching protocols : ( i ) switching through wannier - stark localization induced by static fields with @xmath105 , and ( ii ) switching through a bandwidth renormalization induced by periodic fields with frequency @xmath106 . in case ( i )",
    "we found that while it is possible to rotate the order parameter under the influence of quasi - static fields , it seems very difficult to switch off a quasi - static field in such a way that the order does not melt . in case ( ii )",
    "we were able to rotate the order parameter without melting , although the heating effect is larger than in the case of a hopping quench .",
    "we consider in this section the model with density - density interactions , and the same parameters ( @xmath54 ev , @xmath55 ev , @xmath56 k ) as in the previous simulations .    in the quasi - static field switching illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figper ] , we apply fields of equal strength @xmath107 ( measured in units of @xmath108 , with @xmath37 the lattice spacing @xcite ) to the orbitals 2 and 3 between time @xmath109 fs and @xmath110 fs , while orbital 1 is exposed to a small field of strength @xmath111 ( @xmath112 equal to the initial gap size ) from time @xmath102 to time @xmath109 fs .    while this protocol succeeds in rotating the order parameter in a time of less than @xmath113 fs , both a rapid or smooth switch - off of the strong static field results in a melting of the order .",
    "the transient switching may however provide a seed for the symmetry breaking which occurs after cooling .",
    "it might also be possible to avoid the melting by applying a periodic modulation during the switch - off procedure , but in this case it is more natural to design a scheme which is based entirely on periodic fields .    in the periodic driving protocol ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ figper ] ) , we follow the same strategy as in the case of the hopping quench , and apply the field for @xmath114 fs in band 2 and for @xmath115 fs in band 3 .",
    "the field amplitude is @xmath116 and the frequency @xmath117 ev , which corresponds to an effective bandwidth renormalization by a factor @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "a lower frequency or stronger effective band renormalization leads to stronger heating effects ( note that the correlated density of states has a bandwidth of about 2 ev ( fig .",
    "[ figeq ] ) ) .",
    "we studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of composite orbital order in a three band model with negative hund coupling that captures the essential properties of fulleride compounds .",
    "the composite ordered state corresponds to the jahn - teller metal phase @xcite , which exhibits a coexistence of two ( paired ) mott insulating and one metallic orbital @xcite . in a cubic system with orbitals of @xmath119 type symmetry there",
    "exist three equivalent ordered states with metallic conduction in the @xmath120 direction , respectively , which may be used to store information .",
    "while the read - out of this information can be easily accomplished , a prerequisite for building a memory device based on these states is a reliable and fast switching mechanism between the three equivalent states .    using the nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory in combination with a strong - coupling ( nca ) impurity solver we showed that the effective hopping reduction induced by strong quasi - static or periodic electric fields can induce the desired controlled rotation of the order parameter .",
    "while the switching speed depends on the energy dissipation rate and on the presence or absence of pair - hopping terms , we found that the write operation can in principle be accomplished in a time of o(100 fs ) , which is very fast compared to the o(100 ps ) write speed of the currently fastest proposed technologies for non - volatile memories @xcite .",
    "furthermore , both the write and erase operations can be performed at the same speed , without relying on a thermal melting of the order .",
    "the field strengths and modulation speeds considered in this study are achievable with current day technology , and the @xmath121 bands in fulleride compounds are separated from other bands by a gap of about 1 ev @xcite .",
    "it therefore appears that the electric - field controlled switching of composite order in this class of materials on a sub - picosecond timescale is a realistic proposition , provided that suitable bulk crystals can be synthesized .",
    "since the ordered states have no ordinary orbital moment , they should not induce static lattice distortions , so that the switching time is not limited by lattice dynamics",
    ".    our investigation pushes the limits of nonequilibrium dmft simulations beyond the previously studied single band models and simple order parameters and demonstrates how this theoretical tool can contribute to the exploration of complex nonequilibrium phenomena in correlated multi - band systems .",
    "while this work provides a proof of principle , a material - specific , realistic calculation would have to involve the hopping amplitudes for an fcc lattice , as well as a simulation of field - induced excitations into or out of higher lying bands .",
    "the latter effect is difficult to treat explicitly within nonequilibrium dmft since the memory requirement grows rapidly with increasing number of bands , but it could be taken into account approximately by attaching a fermionic bath with a suitable density of states .",
    "we leave such a material - specific , quantitative simulation as an interesting topic for a future study .",
