    "in the emerging 5 g radio systems , one of the envisioned key scenarios is a high - density network of low - bitrate terminals and sensors with applications , e.g. , in remote metering , health care , smart homes and vehicles @xcite .",
    "this use case , often referred to as the internet - of - things ( iot ) , targets to serve enormous numbers of devices , potentially up to 1 million devices per km@xmath0 , and hence 5 g and beyond base - stations ( bss ) should have extremely good spatial multiplexing and beamforming capabilities .",
    "intense research efforts have recently suggested that one potential solution is to adopt very large antenna arrays , up to hundreds of antenna units , at the bss together with proper transmitter and receiver processing , commonly known as massive mimo @xcite .    in networks with very large numbers of devices and bss",
    "being equipped with large number of antenna units together with associated rf chains , the cost- and energy - efficiency ( bit / joule ) aspects are particularly emphasized . typically , the stringent requirements to reduce costs and energy consumption translate to the use of low - cost components with non - ideal characteristics . in this respect",
    ", there is an urgent need to address the problems regarding the achievable communication performance as well as required waveform schemes , transceiver architectures , and signal processing methods under such non - ideal hardware modules .    in the context of multi - user communications ,",
    "@xcite provide a detailed analysis and discussion on the uplink rates achievable by massive mimo bss with non - ideal hardware . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide a sum - rate analysis for massive mimo uplink impaired by phase - noise showing the imposed limitations on data transmission interval and number of scheduled users .",
    "then focusing on a single - user scenario , @xcite study the achievable mimo downlink rates and mutual information under different assumptions regarding the channel state information ( csi ) at transmitter ( tx ) and/or receiver ( rx ) and for high and low snr regimes , respectively , when the receiver deploys 1-bit adcs .",
    "however , no actual solutions or techniques for the waveform design or spatio - temporal precoding is proposed .",
    "then , the article @xcite considers space - time coding for improved link reliability in 1-bit quantized single - user mimo systems while , again , no methods or solutions are proposed how beyond 1 bit / s / hz spectral efficiency , per real domain and per rx antenna , can be achieved . regarding the signal processing and waveform aspects of fully digital beamforming based massive mimo bss , @xcite propose hardware - efficient implementations of linear spatial precoding which target for better energy - efficiency at massive mimo transmitters .",
    "the works in @xcite also focus on energy - efficiency of massive mimo txs and propose constant - envelope waveform design , enabling the use of energy - efficient non - linear power amplifiers in base - stations .",
    "interestingly , based on the above literature review , the problem of _ multi - user waveform design and optimization to facilitate very low - cost and highly energy - efficient sensor receivers _ is not yet addressed in the existing literature , especially in the timely iot or internet - of - everything ( ioe ) use case where receivers can potentially adopt adcs with very low , possibly even single - bit , conversion accuracy . in such iot / ioe use case , where the number of user devices or terminals can be in the order of 1 billion or even more @xcite , minimizing the energy - consumption , silicon area , and implementation costs of the terminals , through the adoption of highly simple hardware , is a primary concern . to this end , in a very different context of high rate ( multi - gbps ) single - input single - output ( siso ) applications , @xcite provide a related study , seeking to enhance the energy - efficiency of the receiver by adopting simple 1-bit adcs together with oversampling . in @xcite , the mutual information analysis shows that it is in principle possible to achieve rates higher than 1 bit / s / hz per real dimension even when adopting such 1-bit quantization ( per real dimension ) in the receiver . in the same work , a linear temporal precoding scheme in the form of controlled inter - symbol - interference ( isi )",
    "is proposed where a brute force method is used to optimize the overall isi in the considered single - user siso case .",
    "then,@xcite extended the system model in @xcite to frequency - flat block - fading miso channels , and proposed well - structured and hence faster solutions to the isi optimization problem compared to the approach in @xcite .    in this paper , we study a multi - user massive mimo downlink system where the bs serves simultaneously multiple users , each equipped with simple 1-bit receivers ( rxs ) , at the same time - frequency resource , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : mimosystem1bit_trx ] . specifically , we focus on the composite tx waveform design and optimization , in the form of novel spatio - temporal precoding , allowing the spatially multiplexed users to have spectral efficiencies higher than 1 bit / s / hz ( per real dimension , and per receiver antenna ) despite the corresponding receivers preserve only 1-bit information of the received signal .",
    "the main rationale is to include the information about the transmitted symbol into the controlled isi of the oversampled signal such that the receiver can extract this information and can uniquely decode the transmitted symbol using the 1-bit quantized observation . in this respect , we substantially extend the works in @xcite and @xcite with several novel contributions which can be listed as follows :    \\1 ) in contrast to fairly simple single - user studies in @xcite and @xcite , this paper focuses on multi - user massive mimo scenario where multiple users , each equipped with a 1-bit receiver , are served simultaneously at the same time - frequency resource .",
    "\\2 ) in @xcite and @xcite , the search or optimization of the isi sequence is done for a simplified system model where there are no constraints on the tx and/or rx filters .",
    "however , practical tx filters have transmission bandwidth constraints stemming from the spectral mask and emission requirements of the system whereas practical rx filters have bandwidth constraints determined by the desired suppression level of adjacent channel signals and other out - of - band noise and interference . in this paper",
    ", we consider such practical tx and rx filters which both contribute to the overall observable isi in the receivers .",
    "3 ) the overall quantization precoder design is formulated as a constrained convex optimization problem , seeking to maximize the robustness against noise and residual iui , under the practical constraints related to bandlimitation , tx power and tx / rx pulse - shape filtering .",
    "\\4 ) furthermore , the problem formulation is also largely generalized to facilitate arbitrary isi memory lengths unlike the studies of @xcite and @xcite where the isi memory is strictly limited to 1 symbol duration .",
    "\\5 ) finally , in contrast to @xcite and @xcite , the precoding function of input - symbols is not limited to be linear in this paper .",
    "we show that the direct design of the precoding function is challenging for arbitrary lengths of isi memory and hence , alternatively , we propose designing and optimizing the processed ( precoded ) output samples directly .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic system and signal models are introduced in section [ sec : basic system and signal models ] .",
    "then , the principles of multi - user - multiantenna waveform design and detection are addressed in section [ sec : principles of spatio - temporal waveform design and detection for 1-bit receivers ] .",

    "in this article , we consider a time - division duplex ( tdd ) based multi - user massive mimo network , and focus on its downlink where bs has @xmath17 antennas and serves @xmath18 receivers simultaneously at a given time - frequency resource , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . stemming from the assumed iot / ioe / sensor application and to simplify the notations ,",
    "the receivers are all assumed to be single - antenna devices .",
    "such single - antenna user device assumption is also fairly common in the existing massive mimo literature , such as the seminal works @xcite .",
    "there are , however , no technical limitations in applying the developed techniques also in the context of multi - antenna ue receivers in massive mimo networks , as long as the spatial channels from the base - station array towards the individual antennas of a given ue are mutually uncorrelated .",

    "the target is to achieve a spectral efficiency of @xmath22 bit / s / hz per real - dimension where @xmath23 is the input modulation size per real - dimension . for a given transmission bandwidth of @xmath24 and input modulation size @xmath23 , the spectral efficiency per real - dimension",
    "is given by @xmath25 bits / s / hz . by transmission bandwidth @xmath24 , we mean that the baseband equivalent transmit waveform is essentially bandlimited to frequencies of @xmath26 , in two - sided spectral notations",
    ". then following directly from the above spectral efficiency constraints , the transmission bandwidth should satisfy @xmath27 where the upper limit corresponds to @xmath28 .",
    "the basic baseband equivalent block - diagram of the assumed communication system with essential tx and rx processing blocks is shown in fig . [",

    "the composite input - symbol block is processed by tx precoder which , at a general level , maps the matrix of original data - symbols @xmath3 to a matrix of precoded samples @xmath42 . in this work",
    ", we consider a special case of this mapping which is done in two stages , namely the novel quantization precoding followed by a maximum - ratio transmission ( mrt ) or zero - forcing ( zf ) type spatial channel precoder .",
    "the role of the channel precoder is to provide coherent combining of a particular user stream at the intended rx whereas the other user streams are combined incoherently and thereby provide separation of user streams together with beamforming gain in desired signal strength . on the other hand , _",
    "the role of the novel quantization precoding is to enable a particular rx to decode its intended stream considering that the rx has oversampled 1-bit observations which carry only the sign information of the underlying signal .",
    "_ this decomposition separates the two problems , namely 1 ) spatial multiplexing of multiple user streams , and 2 ) temporal coding of each user stream enabling the intended 1-bit rx to uniquely decode the input - symbols from quantized observations .",
    "such two - stage decomposed spatio - temporal precoding approach is directly stemming from the physical propagation and processing chains , namely the transmitted antenna signals are first propagating through the multi - user mimo channel , after which the observation of a given receiver is being sampled and quantized by the single - bit adc .",
    "thus , the overall waveform optimization building on the spatio - temporal two - stage precoding approach is designed in a corresponding manner , such that channel precoding matches the propagation channel while the quantization precoding matches then the single - bit adc characteristics .    in this two - stage processing , the quantization precoding first maps the data - matrix @xmath3 to a precoded matrix @xmath43 expressed as @xmath44 where @xmath45 with @xmath46^t$ ] .",

    "separate per @xmath47 and @xmath48 quantization precoding is directly stemming from the fact that the rx side single - bit adcs also operate separately on the @xmath47 and @xmath48 components of the received signal . in this work",
    "we mainly study two choices of @xmath52 , namely @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the former one corresponds to mapping from input - symbols to a sequence of samples at input symbol - rate whereas in the latter case , the sequence of precoded samples appears at the same oversampled rate as in the rx . in general",
    ", the sample period after the quantization precoding stage can be written as @xmath55 .",
    "detailed descriptions of novel quantization precoding design and optimization are provided in sections [ sec : principles of spatio - temporal waveform design and detection for 1-bit receivers ] and [ sec : design of quantization precoded sequence ] , while here the presentation is limited to general - level input - output expressions to establish fundamental signal models that are then utilized in the actual design and optimization .",
    "quantization precoding is followed by precoding via an @xmath56 spatial channel precoder matrix @xmath57 , written here as @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61^t$ ] . throughout this paper , we assume narrowband flat fading channels between the bs transmitter and @xmath18 receivers , collected into an @xmath62 multi - user mimo channel matrix @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the complex fading coefficient from @xmath65 tx antenna to @xmath66 user rx having i.i.d .",
    "zero - mean gaussian distribution with variance @xmath67 where without of loss of generality we set @xmath68 .",
    "the narrowband assumption is well - justified in the considered iot / ioe / sensor applications where commonly the radio access channel bandwidth is only in the order of a few tens to a few hundreds of khz , and thus with any reasonable delay spread , especially at the center - frequencies where massive mimo is feasible , the channel is essentially flat fading .",
    "then , the corresponding zf and mrt spatial precoders are given up to a scaling constant as @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 refers to the corresponding estimated multi - user mimo channel , while .",

    "the transmitted continuous waveforms from each antenna branch pass then through multi - user mimo channel arriving at the receivers .",
    "the @xmath47 and @xmath48 components of the noisy received signal are then filtered via identical real - valued low - pass receive filters which are essentially limiting the received signal double - sided bandwidth to the useful signal bandwidth @xmath24 and suppressing all spectral components outside this band .",
    "then , the filtered @xmath47 and @xmath48 signals are converted to digital samples via 1-bit adcs which are effectively modeled as sampling and single - bit quantization .",
    "notice that typically bss and also high - throughput terminals with good processing power adopt both analog and ( multi - rate ) digital filters for channel selection whereas here the channel selectivity is assumed to be achieved purely through analog rx filters .",
    "this complies well with the target scenario of highly simple iot / sensor receivers , addressed in this article .",
    "appendix [ app : trx_process ] provides detailed derivations and discussions related to more detailed tx and rx filtering characteristics , channel hardening principle and the corresponding signals at different stages .",
    "based on those derivations , the sampled complex noisy received signal at user @xmath30 , prior to 1-bit quantization , can be expressed as @xmath71 where @xmath72 with @xmath73 denoting the filtered gaussian noise process .",

    "the final outputs of the adcs in the @xmath47 and @xmath48 branches are then formed by the single - bit quantization of the sampled received signal , and can be compactly written as @xmath77 notice that while the fundamental signal models ( 5)-(7 ) are here derived for single - antenna ues , exactly the same models can be used in the context of multi - antenna ue devices , assuming that the spatial channels from the base - station array towards the individual antennas of a given ue are sufficiently uncorrelated . in an extreme example , all @xmath18 receive antennas can belong to the same ue and thus the user index @xmath30 corresponds essentially to the receiver antenna index towards which the particular transmit stream is beamformed . to this end , spatial multiplexing of multiple streams towards a single ue and the waveform optimization solutions developed in this article",
    "are complementary techniques to increase the spectral efficiency of the radio link and the overall radio system under 1-bit receivers .      in the final stage of rx processing , based on the 1-bit quantized @xmath47 and @xmath48 observations , the receiver performs detection , i.e. , makes decisions about the transmitted input symbols . here",

    "classically , this is modeled through state machine and the detection is addressed using viterbi algorithm based sequence detector . in our case , however , the isi appearing in the received signal model is between the _ precoder output samples _ , which are directly influenced and controlled in the waveform optimization .",
    "thus , as long as the precoder optimization is carried out properly , reliable detection can be achieved using a simple memoryless symbol level detector , using only the 1-bit quantized received samples of the corresponding symbol duration .",
    "this will be elaborated in more details in the upcoming sections .",

    "the third constraint is due to the bandwidth constraint of the signal transmitted from each antenna branch and as elaborated in detail in appendix b , the parameter @xmath180 determines the amount of out - of - band emissions which is typically dictated by the emission constraints of the system .",

    "the complete optimization - based framework for quantization precoder design can finally be formulated in an algorithmic form as follows :      the convex constrained optimization problem given in can be solved via available convex optimization tools such as cvx @xcite .",

    "while this topic is partially outside the main scope of this article , we address the impact of imperfect rx filter knowledge in the numerical evaluations in section [ sec : simulations ] , where corresponding simulation examples are provided .",
    "similarly , since the analog rx filters are commonly of the infinite impulse response ( iir ) form , while our system model derivations strictly - speaking assume fir rx filtering , we will also study in section [ sec : simulations ] the impact and the resulting system performance using iir rx filters .",
    "finally , for the fairness of the technical presentation and contents , it is to be acknowledged that while the latency of the detector processing in the receiver is very small , the latency of the overall precoding processing in the bs transmitter is directly proportional to the symbol block - length @xmath38 .",
    "this is because the precoder optimization process and the corresponding resulting mapping from the data symbols to the sequence of quantization precoded samples operate on the input symbol block as a whole .",
    "in this section , we present comprehensive numerical evaluations , in terms of simulated ser curves , for the complete multi - user system illustrated in fig . [ fig : mimosystem1bit_trx ] where the quantization precoder outputs are designed based on the algorithm described in section [ sec : design of quantization precoded sequence ] . in all the simulations , unless otherwise stated , the used data modulation is 16-qam ( 4-ask per real - dimension ) , tx and rx oversampling factors are @xmath200 , the input block size is @xmath201 , the dft size is @xmath202 and @xmath203 . in general , both single - user and multi - user scenarios are evaluated , and also the number of antennas assumed to be adopted in the bs is varied . in general , the per user ser values",
    "are always averaged over 100 independent input symbol block and channel response realizations , while the shown ser values are then further averaged across the users .    in general ,",
    "the chosen filters reflect only one possible realistic setup , but are in no way any limiting or critical factor in the proposed overall waveform design and optimization framework . under the above filtering characteristics , @xmath204 and hence , when combined with the assumed modulation , the spectral efficiency @xmath205 bits / s / hz per real dimension and per user .",
    "thus , when spatially multiplexing , e.g. , @xmath206 users , the total system spectral efficiency is already @xmath207 bits / s / hz .    in the baseline simulations , it is assumed that the bs has perfect knowledge of the tx and rx sampled filter coefficients while the case of having some uncertainty in this knowledge is also experimented . in all the results , the csi used in the channel precoder calculations is always estimated via orthogonal uplink pilots transmitted simultaneously by all user terminals . denoting the number of uplink pilots transmitted by each user as @xmath208 , then @xmath209 orthogonal pilot matrix @xmath210 is formed by stacking each user pilot data as row vectors which satisfies @xmath211 .",

    "notice that this definition essentially relates the total transmit power and the noise power of an individual receiver , hence in a multiuser setting , the transmit snr from an individual user stream perspective is actually smaller .    finally ,",
    "even though some approximations were made in deriving the basic signal models for the waveform optimization purposes , no such approximations are made in the numerical evaluations in calculating the received signal .",

    "<S> is dominated by the high - resolution analog - to - digital converters ( adcs ) , there is a growing interest towards deploying receiver architectures with reduced - bit or even 1-bit adcs . in this paper , we study waveform design , optimization and detection aspects of multi - user massive mimo downlink where user terminals adopt very simple 1-bit adcs with oversampling . in order to achieve spectral efficiency higher than 1 bit / s / hz per real - dimension , and per receiver antenna , we propose a two - stage precoding structure , namely a novel quantization precoder followed by maximum - ratio transmission ( mrt ) or zero - forcing ( zf ) type spatial channel precoder which jointly form the multi - user - multiantenna transmit waveform . </S>",
    "<S> the quantization precoder outputs are designed and optimized , under appropriate transmitter and receiver filter bandwidth constraints , to provide controlled inter - symbol - interference ( isi ) enabling the input symbols to be uniquely detected from 1-bit quantized observations with a low - complexity symbol detector in the absence of noise . </S>",
    "<S> an additional optimization constraint is also imposed in the quantization precoder design to increase the robustness against noise and residual inter - user - interference ( iui ) . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the spatial channel precoder , in turn , is to suppress the iui and provide high beamforming gains such that good symbol - error rates ( sers ) can be achieved in the presence of noise and interference . </S>",
    "<S> extensive numerical evaluations illustrate that the proposed spatio - temporal precoder based multiantenna waveform design can facilitate good multi - user link performance , despite the extremely simple 1-bit adcs in the receivers , hence being one possible enabling technology for the future low - complexity iot networks .    </S>",
