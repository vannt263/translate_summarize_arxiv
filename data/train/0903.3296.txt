    "it is a rare event that one can make exact statements about a strongly correlated electron system , especially in dimensions bigger than one .",
    "competing interactions usually render the problem even more difficult , but sometimes they are also helpful for the analysis . in particular , on highly frustrated lattices",
    "it is possible to construct a macroscopic number of ground states ( gss ) using localized single - particle excitations as building blocks . on the one hand , such a construction has been applied to the so - called flat - band hubbard models in order to show that they exhibit fully saturated ferromagnetism for suitable electron fillings ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", so - called localized magnon states have been found to yield exact many - body gss for highly frustrated quantum antiferromagnets in high magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the localized - magnon gss have important consequences for the low - temperature magneto - thermodynamic properties like an enhanced magnetocaloric effect close to the saturation field @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the corresponding thermodynamics of flat - band hubbard models did not seem to have been investigated despite the long history of these models @xcite .",
    "this motivated us to start studying the thermodynamic properties of correlated electron systems on highly frustrated lattices @xcite . here",
    "we summarize some aspects of the construction of localized - electron gss as well as their consequences for the low - temperature thermodynamics and present some complementary numerical results .",
    "we will discuss two classes of models of correlated electrons .",
    "firstly , we consider the @xmath1-site hubbard hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the lattice sites , @xmath4 are pairs of nearest neighbors , the @xmath5 are the usual fermion operators , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "note that we have chosen @xcite non - standard sign conventions for the hopping integrals @xmath9 and the chemical potential @xmath10 in order to emphasize the analogy with the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model in a magnetic field .",
    "secondly , we consider the @xmath0 model with hamiltonian @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the projector which eliminates doubly occupied sites and @xmath13 are spin-1/2 operators acting on a singly occupied site @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath0 model ( [ eq : tj ] ) arises as the large-@xmath14 limit of the hubbard model ( [ eq : hub ] ) , yielding the relation @xmath15 up to second order in the hopping integrals @xmath9 . however , the implied relation between the @xmath16 is not important for our purposes .",
    "we will therefore ignore it and choose @xmath17 .",
    "conversely , one could choose a site - dependent coulomb repulsion @xmath18 in the hubbard model ( [ eq : hub ] ) without affecting any of our main conclusions .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our main conclusions apply to any highly frustrated lattice .",
    "however , for the sake of concreteness , we will focus on the sawtooth chain sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sawtooth ] .",
    "the hopping integrals @xmath9 are @xmath19 along the base line and @xmath20 along the zigzag - line , respectively .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed along the chain direction .",
    "the single - electron problem is solved as usually by introducing a momentum @xmath21 . on the sawtooth lattice one",
    "finds two branches whose dispersions read @xmath22 remarkably , the lower branch @xmath23 becomes completely flat , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath21-independent for @xmath24 . the sawtooth hubbard model ( [ eq : hub ] ) with this choice of hopping integrals is a particular case of tasaki s model which exhibits saturated ferromagnetism for a half - filled flat band , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the number of electrons is @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "it is common practice to introduce on - site energies for tasaki s model @xcite such that the flat - band condition @xmath24 can be replaced by a condition for the on - site energies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , since this generalization does not change any of the fundamental physics , we will not pursue this either here .",
    "there are many frustrated lattices which yield a lowest completely flat single - electron band , including popular lattices like the kagome and pyrochlore lattices in two and three dimensions , respectively .",
    "in fact , a completely flat lowest single - electron band can be taken as the defining property of a highly frustrated lattice .",
    "given such a flat band of excitations , one can transform back to real space and localize the excitations in a finite region . such `",
    "localized electron excitations ' live in trapping cells which for the sawtooth chain are the valleys formed by three neighboring sites ( see bold lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : sawtooth ] ) .",
    "typically , each site adjacent to a trapping cell is connected to several sites of the trapping cell such that destructive quantum interference between the different paths prevents escape of the electron .",
    "now one can occupy each trapping cell independently by electrons with the two different spin projections . for @xmath26 ,",
    "this yields many - electron gss of the hubbard model ( [ eq : hub ] ) by construction . for @xmath27 , double occupancy of a trapping cell",
    "is forbidden , but a subset of these states remain exact eigenstates : completely spin - polarized states or states consisting of spatially sufficiently separated localized electron excitations ( like the two bold valleys in fig .",
    "[ fig : sawtooth ] ) remain exact eigenstates also for @xmath27 .",
    "positivity of the coulomb term in the hubbard model ( [ eq : hub ] ) implies that such states remain in fact _ ground states _ for @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , the same class of states are also exact eigenstates of the @xmath0 model ( [ eq : tj ] ) . however , in this case the magnetic interaction term is no longer a positive operator . thus , for sufficiently strong @xmath29 other states may acquire lower energy , as has been observed for the sawtooth chain with @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the exact eigenstates under discussion are ground states of the @xmath0 model ( [ eq : tj ] ) generally only for sufficiently small @xmath32",
    ".    one can tune the energy of the flat band to zero by setting @xmath33 with a suitable @xmath34 .",
    "for the sawtooth chain with @xmath31 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sawdisp ] ) shows that @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "all localized - electron gss have zero energy for @xmath37 .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the gs degeneracy is always macroscopic by giving an explicit lower bound .",
    "an alternative lower bound can be derived along the lines of section 2.6.4 of @xcite : take a unit cell of the lattice with @xmath38 sites such that it contains at least one trapping cell which does not overlap with the corresponding trapping cell in the neighboring unit cells ( for the sawtooth chain one can use a unit cell of two valleys , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath39 ) . then each of these trapping cells can be either empty or independently occupied by a spin - up or -down electron .",
    "this yields @xmath40 gss , _",
    "i.e. _ , a lower bound for the gs entropy per site @xmath41 .",
    "two cases should be distinguished for the further analysis .",
    "if all trapping cells are non - overlapping , spatial separation is automatically ensured and each trapping cell can be independently occupied by up to one electron in the presence of repulsive interactions .",
    "it is straightforward to count the localized - electron gss and compute their contribution to thermodynamic quantities for any model of this type @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the average over the localized - electron gss does not yield any macroscopic magnetic moment in this case @xcite .    in the case where trapping cells",
    "overlap , two electrons with different spin projection generally feel the repulsive interaction if they are localized in overlapping regimes .",
    "this favors parallel spin alignment in the gs for larger electron fillings .",
    "if all trapping cells are connected and each of them is occupied by one electron , these arguments give rise to a fully saturated ferromagnetic gs ( flat - band ferromagnetism ) @xcite . in order to count all localized - electron gss ,",
    "we decompose the system into @xmath42-electron clusters , each of which has a @xmath43-fold spin degeneracy @xcite . in one dimension , a suitable labeling yields a mapping to a dimer - type model which can be solved with a transfer matrix method @xcite . for the sawtooth chain with @xmath31",
    "we find a gs entropy per site @xmath44 @xcite , which should be compared to the above lower bound @xmath45 and the lower bound of @xcite : @xmath46 .",
    "note that the dimer mapping can be applied to other one - dimensional models like a model originally due to watanabe @xcite or two kagome - like chains @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the localized - electron states should form a basis of the gs manifold for @xmath26 in order to ensure completeness also for @xmath27 .",
    "this completeness condition can be satisfied if the flat band is separated by a finite gap from the next dispersive band , as is the case for the sawtooth chain . however",
    ", if a dispersive band touches the flat band , this gives rise to additional gss .     per site @xmath1 in the grand canonical ensemble for the sawtooth chain with @xmath24 for two values of the chemical potential @xmath10 .",
    "exact diagonalization ( ed ) results are for @xmath47 sites . ]",
    "now we illustrate and extend some of the above general considerations by presenting a comparison with exact diagonalization ( ed ) for the sawtooth chain . fig .  [",
    "fig : cmulog ] shows the specific heat @xmath48 in the _ grand canonical ensemble _ for @xmath24 and two values of @xmath10 .",
    "firstly , we observe a low - temperature maximum around @xmath49 in the ed results for both values of the chemical potential .",
    "this low - temperature maximum is ( almost ) the same for a finite-@xmath14 hubbard model , the @xmath50 hubbard model ( which is equivalent to the @xmath51 case of the @xmath0 model ) , and even the @xmath0 model with @xmath52 .",
    "this maximum is well described by the effective dimer model @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , it arises from the gs manifold which is split due to the deviation @xmath53 .",
    "comparison with other system sizes than the @xmath47 results of fig .",
    "[ fig : cmulog ] reveals some finite - size effects for @xmath54 while they are negligible for @xmath55 @xcite . note that the limit @xmath56 can be carried out in the effective dimer model ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmulog ] ) @xcite .",
    "the remaining states give rise to another maximum in @xmath48 at a higher temperature @xmath57 .",
    "the area under this second maximum is clearly smaller in the @xmath0 model than in the hubbard model , reflecting the reduced hilbert space .",
    "finite - size effects are negligible in the high - temperature region @xcite .     per site @xmath1 in the canonical ensemble for the sawtooth chain with @xmath58 electrons .",
    "all results are for the @xmath50 hubbard model , or equivalently the @xmath0 model with @xmath51 . ]",
    "we use the @xmath0 model with @xmath51 to discuss some complementary aspects .",
    "the specific heat @xmath48 of the effective dimer model vanishes identically in the _ canonical ensemble _ since the energy of a localized electron state depends only on the electron number @xmath42 .",
    "accordingly , the low - temperature maximum in @xmath48 disappears for @xmath31 , as illustrated by the ed results for @xmath58 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnlog ] .",
    "however , a detuning @xmath59 leads to a splitting of the gs manifold such that the low - temperature maximum reappears , as demonstrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : cnlog ] for @xmath60 ( note that finite - size effects tend to be bigger in the canonical ensemble than in the grand canonical ensemble ) .",
    "this shows that the low - temperature maximum in @xmath48 is not only robust under a small violation of the flat - band condition , but that such a detuning actually helps to stabilize this feature .",
    "for the sawtooth hubbard model with @xmath24 , @xmath47 sites , and different values of @xmath14 .",

    "we quantify the excitations in the sectors with @xmath71 using the integrated number of states with an energy of at most @xmath72 above the degenerate gs manifold .",
    "this quantity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : statesn12 ] for the @xmath47 hubbard model with different values of @xmath14 .",
    "the case @xmath73 is representative of the generic situation while the energy of the lowest excited state is smallest in the sector @xmath74 .",
    "we observe that an appreciable density of states appears at rather low energies above the highly degenerate gss . the fact that the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : statesn12 ] are very similar for small @xmath14 when @xmath72 is scaled by @xmath14 indicates that these low - lying excitations originate from states which used to be gss for @xmath26 . the finite - size dependence at @xmath58 and @xmath64 is analyzed in fig .",
    "[ fig : statesu4 ] for the example @xmath63 . in order to be able to compare different values of @xmath1 , we divide the integrated number of states by the number of gss @xmath75 ( see legends of fig .  [",
    "fig : statesu4 ] for the values ) .",
    "we observe that the density of low - energy excitations increases with @xmath1 , even when compared to @xmath75 .",
    "it is not completely clear at present whether this indicates the absence of a thermodynamic excitation gap for @xmath76 , which would imply quantitative corrections to the dimer model for all temperatures @xmath77 . in any case , this large density of low - lying excitations is probably the origin of the small deviations for @xmath78 in fig .",

    "a splitting of this gs manifold , e.g. , by a small deviation @xmath79 or deviation from the ideal flat - band geometry leads to a characteristic low - temperature peak in the specific heat .",
