    "<S> infrared features of the ghost propagator of color diagonal and color antisymmetric ghost propagator of quenched su(2 ) and quenched su(3 ) are compared with those of unquenched kogut - susskind fermion su(3 ) lattice landau gauge .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare 1 ) the fluctuation of the ghost propagator , 2 ) the ghost condensate parameter @xmath0 of the local composite operator ( lco ) approach and 3 ) the binder cumulant of color anti - symmetric ghost propagator between quenched and unquenched configurations .    </S>",

    "<S> the binder cumulant defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the color anti - symmetric ghost propagator measured by the sample average of gauge fixed configurations via parallel tempering method becomes @xmath7 in all the momentum region . </S>",
    "<S> the binder cumulant of the color antisymmetric ghost propagator of quenched su(2 ) can be explained by the 3-d gaussian distribution , but that of the unquenched milc@xmath2 deviates slightly from that of the 8-dimensional gaussian distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the stronger singularity and large fluctuation in the quenched configuration could be the cause of the deviation of the kugo - ojima confinement parameter @xmath8 from 1 , and the presence of ordering in the ghost propagator of unquenched configurations makes it closer to 1 . </S>"
