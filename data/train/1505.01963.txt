    "in this report , we propose a numerical scheme for the computation of the so - called hyperbolic mean curvature flow @xmath0 here @xmath1 is a family of smooth curves , @xmath2 denotes the curvature and @xmath3 is the unit outer normal vector .    this and similar types of hyperbolic problems were derived as models of oscillatory interface motions .",
    "for example , @xcite derives a model equation based on hamilton s principle , considering stationary points of a geometrical action with local energy density consisting of kinetic and internal energy @xmath4 if the initial velocity is normal to the interface , the velocity remains normal during the motion , which leads to the equation @xmath5 employing the variational structure , the authors show that the flow is locally well - posed and study conditions under which blow - up occurs .",
    "in the case of graphs , they show uniqueness of solution satisfying certain entropy condition .",
    "similar equation @xmath6 which is found to be related to a hyperbolic monge - ampre equation , is studied in @xcite with an emphasis on the development of singularities . the derivation of the equation is not given but its relation to equations for the motion of relativistic strings in minkowski space is mentioned .",
    "on the other hand , regarding damped oscillations , which appear on the solid - liquid interface of some crystals during melting or crystallization , @xcite derived the model equation @xmath7 ( also see the references therein ) . here ,",
    "@xmath8 are the normal velocity and normal acceleration , and @xmath9 denote the interfacial energy , kinetic coefficient , effective density and a driving force for crystallization , respectively .    equation ( [ hmcf ] ) is also addressed in @xcite , where local existence and relations for the evolution of geometrical quantities are shown .",
    "it is a special case of a model equation for the motion of bubbles obtained in @xcite , @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the material derivative of the velocity vector , @xmath12 denotes mass density , @xmath13 is a factor corresponding to pressure , @xmath14 is surface tension and @xmath15 denotes additional sources of momentum .",
    "the numerical solution of the above hyperbolic mean curvature flows have been addressed only scarcely . except for straightforward front tracking schemes",
    ", @xcite develops a crystalline algorithm for the motion of closed convex polygonal curves .",
    "these methods can not directly manage singularities , such as topological changes or the presence of junctions in the multiphase case , yet such problems can be resolved by adopting the level - set approach .",
    "a level - set method for curvature dependent accelerations based on the results of sethian and osher is presented in @xcite . in this method",
    ", a nonlinear ill - posed problem has to be solved and it is not clear how the ideas can be extended to the multiphase setting",
    ".    therefore , in this paper we aim at constructing a numerical scheme based on threshold dynamics of the bmo type .",
    "the bmo algorithm was presented in @xcite and is based on the fact that frequent thresholding of the solution to the heat equation approximates the evolution of level sets according to the standard ( parabolic ) mean curvature flow .",
    "it is not obvious that such a method would be feasible for curvature accelerated motions . nevertheless , investigating the formulae for the solution to the wave equation has revealed that level sets of the solutions whose initial condition is the signed distance to the interface , evolve with normal acceleration equal to their mean curvature , when the thresholding interval approaches zero .    in the following ,",
    "we will present and formally justify the resulting algorithm ( which we call hbmo , the hyperbolic bmo algorithm ) together with its device for propagating velocities over the redistancing step without the need for explicit computation of velocities .",
    "we then comment on potential extensions of our scheme to more general flows , such as those involving phase volume constraints or the motion of junctions .",
    "we also include several numerical results and numerical confirmations regarding the proposed method .",
    "the proposed hbmo algorithm for numerical approximation of the motion ( [ hmcf ] ) in the case of a planar closed curve reads as follows .",
    "+    ' '' ''    given : initial curve @xmath16 , its normal velocity @xmath17 , a final time @xmath18 and a time step @xmath19 .    1 .",
    "extend @xmath17 in a suitable way to a neighborhood of @xmath16 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath20 $ ] solve the initial value problem @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the signed distance function to @xmath16 .",

    "2 .   define @xmath29 as the zero level set of @xmath24 .    ' '' ''    in this section , we explain the ideas behind the derivation of the above hbmo algorithm and provide a formal justification for its convergence .",
    "we divide the explanation into two parts .",
    "we begin by addressing the construction of the first curve @xmath23 ( steps 1 - 3 in the algorithm ) , which will clarify the reason why a threshold - type scheme for the wave equations leads to accelerations proportional to curvature .",
    "then we treat further hbmo steps ( step 4 in the algorithm ) , focusing on obtaining the propagation of interfacial velocities throughout the evolution .",
    "given an initial closed smooth planar curve @xmath16 and its smooth initial normal velocity @xmath17 , we construct an approximation @xmath23 of the curve s evolution by hmcf at time @xmath30 .",
    "this is done as follows :    1 .",
    "extend @xmath17 to the neighborhood of @xmath16 in @xmath31 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the orthogonal projection of @xmath34 on @xmath16 , i.e. , the nearest point to @xmath34 on the curve @xmath16 .",
    "2 .   solve the initial value problem @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the signed distance function to @xmath16 , and where we take @xmath37 here , ( but we keep the general coefficient @xmath38 for later convenience ) .",
    "we remark that the velocity @xmath17 is defined only in a neighborhood of @xmath16 but , since @xmath16 is smooth and @xmath30 can be taken small enough , this fact will not hinder the subsequent step due to the finite speed of propagation .",
    "3 .   define @xmath23 as the zero level set of @xmath24 .",
    "we now examine the evolution of the interface , making use of the explicit representation formula .",
    "the solution to ( [ wave_eq ] ) is equal to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the solution of @xmath41 here and in the sequel , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are points in @xmath44 . using the poisson formula for @xmath40 and a change of variables , we find that the formula for the original solution @xmath45 reads @xmath46    in order to analyze the resulting motion , we take a point on the interface and rotate and translate the coordinate system , so that the point becomes the origin and the outer normal to the interface points in the direction of the @xmath47-axis .",
    "we assume that the interface is smooth in a neighborhood of the origin",
    ". then the value of the signed distance function at any point @xmath48 can be approximated by the following taylor expansion ( see @xcite ) , provided that @xmath49 in ( [ transpoisson ] ) is close to the origin and @xmath50 is sufficiently small ( depending on the smoothness of the interface ) : @xmath51 here @xmath2 is the curvature of the interface at the chosen point ( now the origin ) and the @xmath52 s are smooth functions .",
    "we remark that the error functions , denoted by @xmath52 ( with @xmath53 multiindex ) , will vary from place to place and are always assumed to be smooth and bounded functions of their variables .",
    "we now proceed to calculate the contribution of each term in the signed distance expansion to the solution of wave equation @xmath54 .    for the first term",
    "@xmath55 we have @xmath56 here we use the change of variables @xmath57 to transform the domain of integration to a fixed ball @xmath58 .",
    "also we use the fact that the function @xmath59 is odd with respect to the @xmath47-axis , hence its integral over @xmath58 vanishes .    by a similar calculation ,",
    "the second term @xmath60 gives @xmath61    the third term @xmath62 contributes to the solution as follows : @xmath63    the fourth term @xmath64 yields @xmath65    the velocity term is approximated by its taylor series as follows : @xmath66 since @xmath67 .",
    "finally , the error term in the signed distance expansion can be evaluated as @xmath68    the solution to the wave equation with initial condition @xmath69 in the neighborhood of the origin can thus be written in the following way : @xmath70    from this result we can make the following observation . if the distance travelled by the interface in the normal direction ( i.e. , the @xmath47-direction ) after time @xmath30 is denoted by @xmath71 , then this distance can be calculated from the relation @xmath72 .",
    "in particular , @xmath73 this relation implies that , in terms of the order in @xmath30 , the second order approximation of @xmath71 is @xmath74 , since the error term is of order @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the error term can be estimated by @xmath76 and solving the above equation for @xmath71 , we obtain @xmath77 this means that the interface moves with initial velocity @xmath17 and with an acceleration equal to @xmath78 , the @xmath79-multiple of the curvature . thus taking @xmath37",
    ", we obtain the desired approximation of the interface @xmath80 .",
    "if we want to apply the above scheme to all time steps , the velocities along the interface would need to be computed .",
    "this would severely complicate the numerical solution , even if the velocity field was known .",
    "the difficulties inherent to such an approach are made clear , for example , when considering evolutions that involve topological changes ( e.g. , interfaces that split apart , or contact each other ) .",
    "on the other hand , if we reset the initial velocity to zero , the interface will always accelerate from zero velocity and the accumulated velocities will not propagate .",
    "hence , we need to provide a modification of the above scheme which inherits the velocity from the previous time step and accelerates the interface depending on its curvature .    in order to design a scheme that avoids computation of interface velocities , it is necessary to account for the position of the interface at both the previous and the current time step .",
    "thus , it is natural to consider a vanishing initial velocity in the wave equation and an initial condition of the form @xmath81 here @xmath82 denotes the signed distance function to the present interface @xmath28 , @xmath83 is the signed distance function to the interface at previous time step @xmath84 , and both @xmath85 and @xmath86 denote real numbers ( see figure [ xi - coords ] below ) .",
    "-coordinate system.[xi - coords ] ]    in order to find a precise expansion of the signed distance function @xmath83 to the previous interface , it is necessary to calculate the change in the direction of the outer normal to the interface .",
    "let us denote the point on the previous interface @xmath84 by @xmath87 and the curvature at that point by @xmath88 .",
    "analogous notation is also used for the next interface @xmath28 .",
    "we are now considering @xmath89 , but we still write the symbol @xmath90 since we will be able to choose @xmath85 and @xmath86 to propagate the interface s velocity over each time step . according to ( [ sol1step ] ) , the solution of the wave equation ( [ wave_eq ] ) with initial condition @xmath83 in the @xmath91-coordinate system of figure [ xi - coords ] reads @xmath92 we want to compute the unit outer normal @xmath93 to the level set of @xmath94 at the point @xmath95 in the @xmath91-coordinate system . hence , @xmath96 where @xmath97 this yields @xmath98 and @xmath99    from ( [ normn ] ) we can calculate the deviation angle of the normal in one time step , @xmath100 since @xmath101 .",
    "hence , we conclude that @xmath102 .",
    "the @xmath49-coordinate and @xmath91-coordinate are rotated by the vector @xmath93 and thus , @xmath103 we can now write the signed distance @xmath83 in terms of @xmath49 , as follows ( for simplicity we write @xmath3 , instead of @xmath104 ) : @xmath105 because of ( [ nudef ] ) , the last error term can be written as @xmath106    computing the solution of the wave equation with initial condition @xmath83 and zero initial velocity , we obtain @xmath107 \\\\ & & + \\tfrac{(\\kappa_{n-1})_{x_1}}{6 } [ 3\\nu x_2(c^2t^2+x_1 ^ 2)+3\\nu^2 x_1(c^2t^2+x_2 ^ 2 ) ] -   \\tfrac{(\\kappa_{n-1})_{x_1}}{4 } \\nu^2 x_1(3c^2t^2+x_1 ^ 2 ) \\\\ & & -\\tfrac{\\kappa_{n-1}^2}{2 } [ -\\nu x_1(3c^2t^2+x_1 ^ 2 ) -\\tfrac{7}{2 } \\nu^2x_2(c^2t^2+x_1 ^ 2 ) + 2 \\nu",

    "the solution for for the initial condition @xmath108 evaluated at the point @xmath109 thus reads @xmath110   -\\tfrac{\\kappa_{n-1}^2}{2(1+\\nu^2 ) } \\delta_{n-1 } [ c^2\\tau^2 ( 1+\\nu^2 ) + \\nu^2 \\delta_{n}^2 ] \\big\\ } \\\\ & & + \\sum_{|\\alpha| = 4 } e_{\\alpha}(\\tau,\\delta_n)(\\tau,\\delta_n)^{\\alpha } +   \\sum_{|\\alpha| \\geq 3 } e_{\\alpha}(\\tau , \\delta_{n-1},\\delta_n)(\\tau,\\delta_{n-1})^{\\alpha } . \\ ] ]    the distance @xmath111 traveled by the interface in the normal direction then satisfies @xmath112 , which can be written as @xmath113 where the error terms are of order @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , the quantities @xmath115 and @xmath3 are of order @xmath116 , at worst . since the lowest order approximation of the above equation is @xmath117",
    "we see that @xmath118 must be of order @xmath119 , which is at most @xmath116 .",
    "hence the @xmath120 and @xmath121 terms ( including their coefficients ) are of order @xmath122 or higher and can be neglected . in this way",
    "we obtain the solution @xmath118 to the equation as @xmath123    it is natural to choose @xmath124 so that @xmath125 and @xmath126 , i.e. , @xmath127 . moreover , setting @xmath128 yields @xmath129 which is the desired relation between @xmath118 and @xmath115 .",
    "in particular , if we assume that the curvature is changing smoothly , relation ( [ acc - curve ] ) can be rewritten as follows , @xmath130    to see that this is a correct approximation , consider the one - dimensional point - mass motion with initial velocity @xmath17 and acceleration @xmath131 , thus solving @xmath132 .",
    "the solution is @xmath133 our algorithm ( [ obsc ] ) , including the initial step from the previous subsection , thus gives the approximation @xmath134 the corresponding total distance is @xmath135 which converges as @xmath136 to the function ( [ 1dsol ] ) by the trapezoidal rule .",
    "the above analysis also shows that the accumulation of errors through time does not spoil the approximation of the interface , at least until the development of singularities .",
    "* remark*. regarding the 3d problem , assuming that the signed distance can be expanded as @xmath137 then a similar approach using the solution to the three - dimensional wave equation suggests the validity of our method in higher dimensions : @xmath138   \\\\ & = & x_3 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\kappa_1 ( t^2+x_1 ^ 2 ) + \\frac{1}{2 } \\kappa_2 ( t^2+x_2 ^ 2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this yields the distance traveled by interface in time @xmath50 as @xmath139 confirming that our scheme can also be used with the three - dimensional wave equation , and likely in any higher dimension .",
    "thresholding dynamical algorithms have the computational advantage that there is no need to calculate curvatures , and singularities are implicitly handled by the partial differential equation .",
    "moreover , they are extremely simple to implement ( here , we need only solve the wave equation ) .",
    "thus , one can construct the corresponding numerical method in a number of ways  we will make use of standard finite differences , as well as _ minimizing movements _ for use in investigating volume preserving motions .",
    "our approximation method for computing the hmcf ( [ hmcf ] ) requires one to solve a wave equation , for which there are a number of schemes .",
    "since we are considering an interfacial motion embedded in the solution to a wave equation , care needs to be taken when detecting the interface and constructing the signed distance functions .",
    "in particular , the precise location of the interface is needed . without this information",
    ", errors arising from its approximation will propagate via the evolution of the signed distance functions .    in the same vein ,",
    "since the governing partial differential equation is hyperbolic , care must be taken in the numerical implementation of the method when constructing initial conditions .",
    "in particular , phase locations are encoded by vectors at the nodes of the discretized domain , and so the finite element assumptions can introduce initial interfaces that are not smooth .",
    "one approach to alleviating issues caused by this is to use one step of the original bmo algorithm to smooth the initial interface .",
    "this is easily done , since it only requires one to solve the vector valued heat equation for a small time",
    ".    we will first perform a convergence test for an idealized version of our algorithm .",
    "this test assumes that no errors are introduced under spacial discretization .",
    "our second test introduces the spacial discretization , but computes signed distance functions utilizing an idealized representation of the interface .",
    "the final test removes this idealization and examines our algorithm s order of convergence using standard finite differences .",
    "this section investigates the convergence rate of our algorithm for a simple test problem , under a slight idealization . for a circle evolving by ( [ hmcf ] ) with initial normal velocity @xmath17 ( we assume @xmath140 for simplicity )",
    ", one can compute the evolution of the circle s radius @xmath141 analytically by solving @xmath142 multiplying the equation by @xmath143 and integrating we obtain @xmath144 where @xmath145 is determined by the initial conditions .",

    "the solution can thus be expressed as @xmath149 ^ 2 \\right ) , \\ ] ] which yields a more simple form for zero initial velocity : @xmath150 ^ 2 } .\\ ] ]    since the function @xmath151 tends to infinity when @xmath152 , the radius vanishes in a finite time , which can be computed from the relation @xmath153 after substituting values of integration constants , this gives @xmath154 we remark that the extinction time for zero initial velocity is @xmath155 ( see figure [ hmcfode ] ) .",
    ".[hmcfode ] ]    let us now calculate the numerical approximation due to our scheme .",
    "that is , we consider two circles of radii @xmath156 , centered at the origin , which describe the initial conditions .",
    "we then compute the radius of the circle given by the @xmath157-level set of the solution ( after time @xmath50 ) to the problem @xmath158 here , @xmath128 and @xmath159 is the signed distance function to the circle of radius @xmath160 , which can be written as @xmath161 . hence , denoting @xmath162 , the initial condition is given by @xmath163 and the solution of the above initial value problem ( sufficiently far away from the origin ) is @xmath164 since the initial condition is radially symmetric and there is no interaction with a boundary , we can restrict the values of @xmath49 to points on the @xmath49-axis of the form @xmath165 , where @xmath166 .",
    "then the above simplifies to @xmath167 the exact form of the solution to the above equation is difficult to find , since it involves elliptic integrals .",

    "contrast to parabolic mean curvature flow , we observe oscillations in the interfacial motion  the effect of acceleration is also evident in the motion of the phase region s centre .",
    "since the solution to the wave equation depends only on local information , one can formulate a multiphase algorithm which is akin to the original multiphase bmo algorithm in @xcite .",
    "in particular , thresholding a collection of independently evolving wave equations , can formally be shown to compute multiphase interfacial motions with normal acceleration equal to curvature .",

    "this fact allows one to obtain the curvature of the interface by computing the laplacian of ( [ scalardist ] ) .",
    "moreover , as shown in @xcite , this setting introduces a multiple well potential which allows one to express multiphase volume constrained motions .",
    "our approximation method for computing multiphase interfacial dynamics thus repeats the pde step ( [ vpde ] ) and the thresholding step ( [ trunc ] ) .",
