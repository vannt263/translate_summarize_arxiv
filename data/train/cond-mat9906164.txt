    "the object of our study is the self organization of an ensemble of interacting individuals : we would like to develop a model of a co - evolving ecosystem . in this paper only the very few steps of this project are presented ; we study the emerging features of asexual populations in very simple environments .    this paper complements ( and sometimes overlaps ) the review by baake and gabriel  @xcite .",
    "many of the mathematical topics we deal with ( say , error threshold , mutational meltdown , muller s ratchet ) find there a correct biological perspective .",
    "we also suggest baake and gabriel s review as a source of commented references .",
    "several models exist concerning the properties of multi - species populations ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) , however we would like to start at a more elementary level , based on individual dynamics .",
    "our basic building block is a very simple schematization of an individual : just a string of symbols ( the _ genotype _ ) corresponding to a few phenotypic traits , which are functions of the genotype . in this way we model haploid individuals both without sexual reproduction and without polymorphism . in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to the study of spatially homogeneous systems ( spatial mean field ) , which means that we are simulating the evolution in a well stirred container .    in a very fundamental model , each individual would feed on somebody else , including the external source of energy .",
    "a similar approach is presented in the web - world model  @xcite , which is however based on the species concept , rather than on individual dynamics . in many cases ,",
    "one is interested in only a part of an ecosystem .",
    "very few studies ( if any ) take into consideration all interactions among organisms , say from mammals and plants to the microscopic world . one is tempted to assume that an ecosystem ( which should in principle correspond to the whole earth ) can be broken into subsystems each of which is weakly coupled to the rest of the world and has different characteristic times .",
    "for instance , one could focus on animals , considering the vegetables as a static substrate . or , alternatively , study the vegetables considering the animals as self - averaging fluctuations .",
    "this simplification is valid only for a limited amount of time , which may be long on the individual time - scale .",
    "eventually , a rearrangement ( say , climate change , asteroid impact , human pollution ) will heavily change the system .",
    "this focusing on a part of the whole system can be modeled by the concept of the _ fitness landscape_. this landscape is customary defined as the average number of offsprings which reach the reproduction age , and in general it is originated by complex interactions with many other individuals . since the outside world is considered fixed , also the interactions with individuals belonging to it do not change with time . thus the reproduction rate can be divided into a static term ( the static fitness landscape ) and an interaction term , which depend on the presence of individuals in the subsystem under study .",
    "the internal interactions can be classified into predation ( parasitism ) , competition or cooperation , depending on how the presence of an individual affects the reproduction rate of another one . in a fundamental description ,",
    "only predation or parasitism should be present ; however , the average over the outside world can induce the presence of competition or cooperation between two individuals in the same subsystem .",
    "the evolution on a static fitness landscape ( i.e. without internal interactions among individuals ) is a very interesting subject by itself , and will be studied in this article limited to very smooth landscapes .",
    "this subject is directly related to the properties of genealogical trees .",
    "since the landscape is fixed , the evolution of a population can be obtained as a sum over all possible stories of individuals , in a way similar to using a path integral approach in equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "this equivalence is investigated further in section  [ sec : path ] .",
    "we find that on a flat enough landscape and for large enough mutation rates the asymptotic distribution is indeed a boltzmann one , in which the fitness plays the role of the energy and mutations that of a temperature .",
    "one of the most striking feature of evolution is the breakdown of an uniform distribution ( both in the genotypic and in the phenotypic space ) and the formation of the clusters of individuals that are eventually denoted as `` species '' .",
    "the definition of a species is not a trivial task .",
    "one definition ( a ) is based simply on the phenotypic differentiation among the clusters , and can be easily applied also to asexual organisms , such as bacteria . another definition ( b ) , that applies only to sexual organism ,",
    "is based on the inter - breeding possibility .",
    "finally ( c ) , one can define the species on the basis of the genotypic distance of individuals , taking into consideration their genealogical story  @xcite .",
    "many properties of genealogical trees on flat landscapes have been studied by derrida , higgs and peliti  @xcite , both for asexual and sexual reproduction .",
    "their conclusion is that species ( defined using the reproductive isolation , definition ( b ) ) can appear in flat static landscapes provided with sexual reproduction and discrimination of mating . in some sense",
    "these authors have identified definitions ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "also the reason for the existence of species is quite controversial  @xcite .",
    "we are here referring to the formation of species in a spatially homogeneous environment , i.e.  to _ sympatric _ speciation . in this frame of reference ,",
    "a niche is a phenotypic realization of relatively high fitness .",
    "species have obviously to do with niches , but one can not assume that the coexistence of species simply reflects the presence of `` pre - existing '' niches ; on the contrary , what appears as a niche to a given individual is co - determined by the presence of other individuals ( of the same or of different species ) .",
    "in other words , niches are the product of co - evolution .",
    "most authors consider sexual discrimination as the fundamental ingredient for the formation of species in flat ( or almost flat ) fitness landscapes ( no niches ) . in this paper",
    "we deal only with asexual populations , so we stick to the phenetic definition ( a ) . instead of the `` species '' term ( which has a very precise meaning for biologists  @xcite )",
    "we adopt the weaker term `` quasi - species '' , to indicate a group of phenotypically similar individuals , separated ( again , in the phenotypic space ) by other groups .",
    "we further use the term `` speciation '' to denote the process of division of a quasi - species in two or more groups , or , considering a quasi - static situation , the coexistence of several quasi - species .",
    "the speciation phenomenon can occur on static landscapes with several ( almost degenerate ) maxima , which correspond to the niche concept .",
    "however , as discussed in section  [ sec : coexistence ] , in this case the coexistence depends sensitively on the mutation rate , or is just a transient phenomenon . on very rough landscapes",
    ", this transient behavior can extend to very long times , in a way similar to the spin glass behavior  @xcite .",
    "the roughness of the landscape depends also on the observation scale , and is minimal on the individual level and much larger on the species level .",
    "since we are interested in the individual dynamics , we assume quite smooth landscapes .",
    "one of the first studies of evolution an a static landscape was performed by eigen and others  @xcite . they investigated the role of mutation in destroying a quasi - species located around the fittest strain .",
    "this effect is called the error threshold transition , and takes the form of a real phase transition ( first order ) in the limit of infinite genome length and infinite population  @xcite . the error threshold for finite populations",
    "has been studied in refs .",
    "this phase transition is not present for smooth landscapes ( for an example of a study of evolution on a smooth landscape , see ref .",
    "the limit of long genomes is interesting , since in this case one can neglect to consider back mutations  @xcite . in this case",
    "another mechanism is present , the so called muller s ratchet  @xcite or stochastic escape  @xcite , which , for finite populations , causes the loosing of fitter strains by stochastic fluctuations .",
    "since it relies on a random process , the average escape time is of the order of the exponential of the size of the strain  @xcite , and thus this effect is relevant only for small populations .    on the other hand",
    ", this effect can lower the average fitness of the population below a viable threshold , after which extinction can occur  @xcite while the distribution still retains the quasi - species bell shape .",
    "both the error threshold and the muller s ratchet phenomenon will be investigated in section  [ sec : toy ] .    in section  [ sec : dynamicalevolution ]",
    ", we include the effects of the interactions among individuals belonging to the subsystem under study .",
    "the most fundamental terms are two - body interactions . in this paper",
    "we are mainly interested in the speciation phenomenon , i.e.  to the differentiation of otherwise similar individuals .",
    "intra - specific cooperation , i.e.  the increase of reproduction rate due to the presence of a genetically related individual is presumably due to familiar or group structure , and will not be considered here .",
    "we assume that the more similar two individuals are , the greater is the competition term that lowers their fitness .",
    "one can think that this competition term arises from averaging over shared resources belonging to the outside world .",
    "one of the most interesting feature that originates from the inclusion of an intra - specific competition term is phenotypic differentiation .",
    "let us assume that the static fitness landscape has a single smooth maximum . without competition , the distribution of an asexually reproducing population would follow a bell shaped curve , peaked around the maximum and whose width is given by mutation and also by the curvature of the maximum ( for small mutation rates ) . if the competition term is large enough , this single peak curve will split into several `` quasi - species '' , separated by the range of the inter - specific competition , as shown in section  [ sec : phenotypicspeciation ] .",
    "the fact that one can observe phenotypic splitting of a population solely due to competition is very interesting . in presence of sexual reproduction ( which has not been studied here ) the competition lowers , since the phenotypic distribution is broader .",
    "this could well be a valid reason for the evolutionary survival of sexual reproduction in spite of its cost  @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the splitting due to competition holds even in presence of sexual reproduction ( under study at present ) , it may be invoked as an effective mechanism for sympatric speciation .",
    "mutations act on the genotype , while selection acts on the phenotype .",
    "a single mutation can greatly alter the phenotype .",
    "however , if one neglects immediately lethal mutations ( they simply change the fitness of the genome ) , most of surviving mutants have very similar phenotypes with respect to the parent .",
    "thus , in many cases one can get rid of the genotypic space : for large scale evolution ( formation of species ) one can assume that mutations induces a diffusion in the phenotypic space , while for small scale evolution ( asymptotic distribution of intra - specific traits ) one can assume that mutations are able to generate all possible phenotypic traits .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we discuss the ingredients needed in our models . in section  [ sec : ca ] we present a cellular automaton model of an evolving ecosystem which is our microscopic reference system .",
    "the spatial mean field theory of it allows us to obtain ( section  [ sec : mf ] ) the well known mutation - selection equation ( corresponding to a reaction - diffusion process in the genotypic space ) .",
    "we then develop some considerations about evolving ecosystems without competition : in section  [ sec : path ] we examine to what extent an evolutionary system can be considered equivalent to an equilibrium statistical model ; in section  [ sec : toy ] we present a toy model exhibiting the error threshold , the mutational meltdown  @xcite and the muller s ratchet effects ; finally , in section  [ sec : phenotypicevolution ] we derive the shape of a quasi - species as a function of the height and curvature of a maximum of the static fitness landscape .",
    "these last results will be useful to determine the distribution of quasi - species in presence of competition .",
    "afterward , in section  [ sec : coexistence ] we analyze to what extent coexistence can be present on a static fitness landscape .    in section  [ sec : dynamicalevolution ]",
    ", we introduce the intra - specific competition interaction .",
    "we show that such a model can present phenotypic differentiation ( speciation : formation of quasi - species ) even in absence of sexual reproduction .",
    "since the evolution in the genotypic space is difficult to analyze theoretically , we present in section  [ sec : phenotypicspeciation ] a model of phenotypic evolution which still exhibits the speciation effect and that can be analyzed analytically . these approximate analytical results are confirmed by monte carlo simulations in the effective genotypic space , as reposted in section  [ sec : hypercubic ] .",
    "the conclusions are illustrated in the last section .",
    "the fundamental ingredient of evolutionary models is the genetic information transmitted from one generation to the other , and the selection mechanism that models the distribution of this information . in what follows",
    "we consider discrete generations , since they are more directly implemented on a computer .",
    "the cellular automaton model that presented in section  [ sec : ca ] is our microscopic reference system . by varying some parameters it may present both non - overlapping and overlapping generations .    in the simplest version , the genetic information ( _ genotype _ ) of an individual",
    "is represented by a binary string @xmath0 of @xmath1 symbols @xmath2 . in this way we are modeling haploid ( only one copy of each gene ) organisms , i.e.   bacteria or viruses or , more appropriately ,",
    "more archaic , pre - biotic entities .",
    "the choice of a binary code is not fundamental but certainly makes things easier .",
    "it can be justified by thinking of a purine - pyrimidine coding of dna or of good and bad alleles for genes . in this second version",
    ", @xmath3 represents a good gene and @xmath4 a bad one . for bacteria",
    ", one can prove that major and minor codons work in such a way  @xcite .",
    "sometimes we represent a genome using ising - like variables @xmath5 .    during the individual life ,",
    "errors ( mutations ) accumulate into the germ line ( which for unicellular organisms coincide with the somatic line ) .",
    "when one individual reproduces , it duplicates its genetic material , and during this process other mutations can occur .",
    "these errors are transmitted to the progeny and cause the fact that even for asexual organisms the offspring can be different from the parent .",
    "we do not think that the differences between these two kinds of hereditary mutations causes qualitatively different behaviors , at least at the level of schematization of this work .    while there is a great variety of possible mutations ( insertions , deletions , transposition , inversions , etc ) , from a mathematical point of view it is preferable not to alter the length of the genome ( otherwise we should introduce a three - symbols code , say 1 for good genes , -1 for bad genes and 0 for empty positions , i.e.  neutral genes ) .",
    "we can define the distance between two genomes @xmath6 and @xmath7 as the minimal number of point mutations needed to pass from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and this coincides with the hamming distance @xmath8 .",
    "thus , all possible genomes of length @xmath1 are distributed on the @xmath9 vertices of an hypercube .",
    "a point mutation corresponds to a unit displacement on that hypercube ( short - range jumps ) .    for simplicity",
    "we assume that all point mutations are equally likely , while in reality they depend on the identity of the symbol and on its positions on the genome .",
    "for real organisms , the probability of observing a mutation is quite small .",
    "we assume that at most one mutation is possible in one generation .",
    "we denote with @xmath10 the probability of having one point mutation per generation .",
    "other mutations correspond to long - range jumps in the genotypic space .",
    "a very rough approximation consists in assuming all mutations equiprobable .",
    "let us denote with @xmath13 the probability per generation of this kind of mutations .",
    "the long - range mutation matrix , @xmath14 , is defined as @xmath15    in the real world , only a certain kind of mutations are possible , and in this case @xmath14 becomes a sparse matrix @xmath16 .",
    "we introduce a sparseness index @xmath17 which is the average number of nonzero off - diagonal elements of @xmath16 .",
    "the sum of these off - diagonal elements still gives @xmath13 . in this case",
    "@xmath16 is a quenched sparse matrix , and @xmath14 can be considered the average of the annealed version .",
    "both @xmath18 and @xmath14 are markov matrices .",
    "moreover , they are circular matrices , since the value of a given element does not depend on its absolute position but only on the distance from the diagonal .",
    "this means that their spectrum is real , and that the largest eigenvalue is @xmath19 .",
    "since the matrices are irreducible , the corresponding eigenvector @xmath20 is non - degenerate , and corresponds to the flat distribution @xmath21 .",
    "we discuss in details the properties of these matrices in appendix  a.    we use the following _ easter egg _ representation for quasi - species in the boolean hyper - cubic space : starting from the origin of axis , we perform a step of a fixed length @xmath22 with an angle @xmath23 if the @xmath24th bit ( @xmath25 ) of genotype @xmath6 has value one . in this way one",
    "locates the _ master sequence _ ( all zeros ) at the origin ; the strains with one bad gene , distributed according to the bad gene position at distance @xmath22 ; the strains with two bad genes at an approximate distance of @xmath26 , and so on .",
    "an example of the resulting hypercube for @xmath27 is shown in figure  [ fig : hyper ] .",
    "the other necessary ingredient is the selection mechanism , which can either modify the survival probability of individuals or their reproduction efficiency .",
    "the selection does not act directly on the genome , but rather on the _ phenotype _ ( how an individual appears to others ) .",
    "the phenotype @xmath28 of a given genotype @xmath6 can be thought of as an array of morphological characteristics , and generally lives in a much simpler space than the genotype .",
    "we consider the simplest case , for which @xmath29 is just a real variable .",
    "moreover we consider @xmath29 as a single - valued function of the genotype @xmath30 , which is not the general case , since polymorphism or age dependence are usually present .    in general ,",
    "the selection mechanism is represented by the concept of the _ fitness function _",
    "@xmath31  @xcite , which depends on the phenotype of the individual and on those present in the environment .",
    "the fitness function can be defined as the average variation rate of the number of individuals that share that phenotype in a given environment , _ if at least one individual were present_. this implies that one can speak of the fitness of phenotypes that never appeared in the environment .",
    "the fitness function summarizes the effects of reproduction and death rate , etc .",
    "the more apt an individual , the larger its fitness .",
    "if direct interactions are not present , then the fitness does not depend on the presence of other individuals , and it is a function of the individual phenotype only .",
    "this leads to the concept of _ fitness landscape _",
    ", analogous to the potential surface for noninteracting particles .",
    "this analogy will be stressed in section  [ sec : path ] .",
    "evolution thus can be considered an _ adaptive walk _ in the fitness landscape @xcite looking for the fitness optimum where displacements in this space are due to mutations . in presence of a vanishing mutation rate and an infinite population ,",
    "the system evolves until it reaches a local maximum of the fitness .",
    "the effects of mutations and finite populations ( genetic drift ) can lead to the escape from a local maximum ( see section  [ sec : toy ] ) .",
    "as already noticed , the genotypic space is a high dimensional hypercube .",
    "analytical results in such a space are very difficult to obtain .",
    "the phenotypic space is much simpler , and one is tempted to study evolution in such a space .",
    "for instance , assume that the phenotype @xmath28 is simply given by the sum of bits in @xmath6 .",
    "the phenotypic space is thus degenerate ( there are several genotypes with the same phenotype ) and since point mutations change the phenotype by one unit , it is possible to write the mean - field evolution in phenotypic space by inserting the appropriate degeneration factors .",
    "for a generic fitness function one can study the evolution in phenotypic space only in the limit of a very flat landscape and a vanishing mutation rate , assuming that mutations are able to connects all the genotypes , ( for instance , using long - range mutations ) .",
    "we use the following form for the phenotype @xmath29 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a random function of @xmath6 , uniformly distributed between @xmath34 and @xmath4 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the magnetic term @xmath36 represents a non - epistatic interaction among loci , @xmath37 represents a weakly rough landscape , while @xmath38 modulates a widely rough landscape ( it can be thought as an approximation of a spin - glass landscape ) .",
    "the exact definition of the fitness function is deferred to the next section , in which a microscopic model will be presented .",
    "we see in section  [ sec : mf ] that in a mean field approach , the reproduction rate can be approximated by @xmath40 which has a form reminiscent of a statistical mechanics model .",
    "we call @xmath41 the fitness _ tout court _ , while @xmath42 is a parameter that can be used to modulate the steepness of @xmath31 . we always use @xmath43 .",
    "the fitness is composed by two parts : the _ static fitness _",
    "@xmath47 , and the _ interaction term _ , whose kernel is the interaction matrix @xmath48 .",
    "the field @xmath47 represents a fixed or slowly changing environment ; the matrix @xmath48 defines the chemistry of the world and is fixed in time .",
    "a phenotype @xmath29 with static fitness @xmath49 represents individuals that can survive in isolation ( say , after an inoculation into an empty substrate ) , while a strain with @xmath50 represents predators or parasites that require the presence of some other individuals to survive ( again , the phenotype can also not be present in the environment ) . in this paper",
    "we generally consider a static fitness function @xmath51 , with a single maximum .",
    "the matrix @xmath48 mediates the interactions between two strains . for a classification in terms of usual ecological interrelations",
    ", one has to consider together @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "one can have four cases :"
