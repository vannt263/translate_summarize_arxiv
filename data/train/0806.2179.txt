    "cosmological shocks are collisionless shocks which form in a tenuous plasma via collective electromagnetic interactions between baryonic particles and electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "they play key roles in governing the nature of the igm through the following processes : in addition to the entropy generation , cosmic - rays ( crs ) are produced via diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) @xcite , magnetic fields are generated via the biermann battery mechanism @xcite and weibel instability @xcite and also amplified by streaming crs @xcite , and vorticity is generated at curved shocks @xcite .",
    "cosmological shocks in the intergalactic space have been studied in details using various hydrodynamic simulations for the cold dark matter cosmology with cosmological constant ( @xmath0cdm ) @xcite . in this contribution",
    ", we describe the properties of cosmological shocks and their implications for the intergalactic plasma from a simulation using a pm / eulerian hydrodynamic cosmology code @xcite with the following parameters : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , @xmath4/(100 km / s / mpc ) = 0.7 , and @xmath5",
    ". a cubic region of comoving size 100 @xmath6 mpc was simulated with @xmath7 grid zones for gas and gravity and @xmath8 particles for dark matter , allowing a uniform spatial resolution of @xmath9 kpc .",
    "the simulation is adiabatic in the sense that it does not include radiative cooling , galaxy / star formation , feedbacks from galaxies / stars , and reionization of the igm .",
    "a temperature floor was set to be the temperature of cosmic background radiation .",
    "as a post - processing step , shocks in the simulated volume are identified by a set of criteria based on the shock jump conditions . then the locations and properties of the shocks such as shock speed ( @xmath10 ) , mach number ( @xmath11 ) , and kinetic energy flux ( @xmath12 ) are calculated .    in the top panels of figure 1",

    "internal shocks are found within the region bounded by external shocks .",
    "external shocks have high mach numbers of up to @xmath16 due to the low temperature of the accreting gas in the void region .",
    "internal shocks , on the other hand , have mainly low mach numbers of @xmath17 , because the gas inside nonlinear structures has been previously heated by shocks and so has high temperature .     in units of @xmath18 .",

    "the frequency of cosmological shocks in the simulated volume is represented by the quantity @xmath23 , the area of shock surfaces per unit comoving volume , in other words , the reciprocal of the mean comoving distance between shock surfaces . in the top left panel of figure 2",
    ", we show @xmath24 per unit logarithmic shock speed interval at @xmath13 .",
    "we note that the frequency of low speed shocks with @xmath25 km s@xmath20 is overestimated here , since the temperature of the intergalactic medium is unrealistically low in the adiabatic simulation without the cosmological reionization process .",
    "although shocks with @xmath26 a few @xmath27 10 km s@xmath20 are most common , those with speed up to several @xmath28 km s@xmath20 are present at @xmath13 . the mean comoving distance between shock surfaces is @xmath29 when averaged over the entire universe , while it is @xmath30 inside the nonlinear structures of clusters , filaments , and sheets .    in order to evaluate the energetics of cosmological shocks ,",
    "the incident shock kinetic energy flux , @xmath31 , is calculated . here",
    "@xmath32 is the preshock gas density .",
    "then the average kinetic energy flux through shock surfaces per unit comoving volume , @xmath33 , is calculated .",
    "the top right panel of figure 2 shows @xmath34 per unit logarithmic shock speed interval .",
    "energetically the shocks with @xmath35 km s@xmath20 , which form in the deepest gravitation potential wells in and around clusters of galaxies , are most important .",
    "those responsible for most of shock energetics are the internal shocks with relatively low mach number of @xmath36 in the hot igm , because they form in the high - density gas inside nonlinear structures . on the other hand",
    ", external shocks typically form in accretion flows with the low - density gas in voids , so the amount of the kinetic energy passed through the external shocks is rather small .",
    ", and cr acceleration efficiency , @xmath37 , as a function of mach number .",
    "symbols are the values estimated from numerical simulations based on a dsa model and dotted and dashed lines are the fits .",
    "solid line is for the gas thermalization efficiency for shocks without crs . ]    in addition to the gas entropy generation , the acceleration of crs is an integral part of collisionless shocks , in which electromagnetic interactions between plasma and magnetic fields provide the necessary viscosities .",
    "supra - thermal particles are extracted from the shock - heated thermal particle distribution @xcite . with @xmath38 of the particle flux passing through the shocks injected into the cr population , up to @xmath3960% of the kinetic energy of strong quasi - parallel shocks can be converted into cr ions and the nonlinear feedback to the underlying flow can be substantial @xcite . at perpendicular shocks ,",
    "however , the cr injection and acceleration are expected to be much less efficient , compared to parallel shocks , since the transport of low energy particles normal to the average field direction is suppressed .",
    "so the cr acceleration depends sensitively on the mean magnetic field orientation .    time - dependent simulations of dsa at quasi - parallel shocks with a thermal leakage injection model and a bohm - type diffusion coefficient have shown that the evolution of cr modified shocks becomes self - similar , after the particles are accelerated to relativistic energies and the precursor compression reaches a time - asymptotic state @xcite .",
    "the self - similar evolution of cr modified shocks depends somewhat weakly on the details of various particle - wave interactions , but it is mainly determined by the shock mach number . based on this self - similar evolution , we can estimate the gas thermalization efficiency , @xmath40 , and the cr acceleration efficiency , @xmath37 , as a function shock mach number , which represent the fractions of the shock kinetic energy transferred into the thermal and cr energies , respectively .",
    "figure 3 shows the results of such dsa simulations @xcite . from the figure",
    ", we expect that at weak shocks with @xmath17 the energy transfer to crs should be @xmath41 % of the shock kinetic energy at each shock passage , whereas at strong shocks with @xmath42 the transfer is very efficient and the flow should be significantly modified by the cr pressure .",
    "adopting the efficiencies shown in figure 3 , the thermal and cr energy fluxes dissipated at each cosmological shock can be estimated as @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "then the total energies dissipated through the surfaces of cosmological shocks during the large - scale structure formation of the universe can be calculated @xcite .",
    "the bottom panels of figure 2 show the thermal and cr energies , integrated from from @xmath22 to 0 , normalized to the total gas thermal energy at @xmath13 , as a function of shock speed . here",
    "we assume crs are freshly injected at shocks without a pre - existing population .",
    "the shocks with @xmath45 km s@xmath20 are most responsible for the shock dissipation into heat and crs .",
    "the figure shows that the shock dissipation can count most of the gas thermal energy in the igm @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the total cr energy , @xmath46 ) , to the total gas thermal energy , @xmath47 ) , dissipated at cosmological shocks throughout the history of the universe is about 0.4 ( where @xmath48 is the minimum shock speed ) , giving a rough estimate for the energy density of cr protons relative to that of thermal gas in the igm as @xmath49 .",
    "because of uncertainties in the dsa model such as the field obliquity and the injection efficiency , however , it is not meant to be an accurate estimate of the cr energy in the igm . yet",
    "the results imply that the igm could contain a dynamically significant cr population .",
    ") . here , @xmath50 is the present age of the universe . ]",
    "vorticity can be generated in the igm either directly at curved cosmological shocks or by the baroclinity of flow .",
    "the baroclinity is resulted mostly from the entropy variation induced at cosmological shocks .",
    "therefore , the baroclinic vorticity generation also can be attributed to the presence of cosmological shocks .",
    "a quantitative estimation of the vorticity in the igm was made using the data of the simulation described in  1 @xcite .",
    "the bottom panels of figure 1 show the distribution of the vorticity around a cluster complex .",
    "the distribution closely matches that of shocks , as expected .",
    "the top panels of figure 4 show the magnitude of the vorticity in the simulated volume as a function of gas temperature and density . here",
    "the vorticity magnitude is given in units of the reciprocal of the age of the universe , @xmath51 .",
    "there is a clear trend that the vorticity is larger in hotter and denser regions . at the present epoch ,",
    "the rms vorticity is @xmath52 to @xmath53 in the regions associated with clusters / groups of galaxies ( @xmath54 k ) and filaments ( @xmath55 k ) , whereas it is on the order of unity in sheetlike structures with @xmath56 k and even smaller in voids with @xmath57 k.    with @xmath58 interpreted as the local eddy turnover time , @xmath59 represents the number of eddy turnovers of vorticity in the age of the universe .",
    "it takes a few turnovers for vorticity to decay into smaller eddies and develop into turbulence .",
    "so with @xmath60 , the flows in clusters / groups and filaments is likely to be in the state of turbulence . on the other hand , with @xmath61 the flow in sheetlike structures and voids",
    "is expected to be mostly non - turbulent .    in order to estimate the energy associated with the turbulence in the igm",
    ", the curl component of flow motions , @xmath62 , which satisfies the relation @xmath63 , is extracted from the velocity field . as vorticity cascades and develops into turbulence ,",
    "the energy @xmath64 is transferred to turbulent motions , so it can be regarded as the turbulence energy , @xmath65 . as",
    "shown in @xcite , @xmath66 in clusters / groups .",
    "in particular , the mass - averaged value is @xmath67 in the intracluster medium ( icm ) , which is in good agreement with the observationally inferred values in cluster core regions @xcite . in filaments and sheets ,",
    "this ratio is estimated to be @xmath68 and it increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "how have the intergalactic magnetic fields ( igmfs ) arisen ?",
    "the general consensus is that there was no viable mechanism to produce strong , coherent magnetic fields in the igm prior to the formation of large - scale structure and galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , it is reasonable to assume that weak seed fields were created in the early universe . a number of mechanisms , including the biermann battery mechanism @xcite and weibel instability @xcite working at early cosmological shocks ,",
    "have been suggested @xcite .",
    "the turbulence described in  4 then can amplify the seed fields in the igm through the stretching of field lines , a process known as the turbulence dynamo . in this scenario",
    "the evolution of the igmfs should go through three stages : ( i ) the initial exponential growth stage , when the back - reaction of magnetic fields is negligible ; ( ii ) the linear growth stage , when the back - reaction starts to operate ; and ( iii ) the final saturation stage @xcite .    in order to estimate the strength of the igmfs resulted from the dynamo action of turbulence in the igm , we model the growth and saturation of magnetic energy as : @xmath69&{\\rm for}\\ t'<4 , \\\\ ( 0.36/41 ) \\times ( t'-4 ) + 0.04&{\\rm for}\\ 4<t'<45 , \\\\ 0.4 & { \\rm for}\\ t'>45 , \\end{array } \\right . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] based on a simulation of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence @xcite . here",
    "@xmath70 is the number of eddy turnovers .",
    "this provides a functional fit for the fraction of the turbulence energy , @xmath65 , transfered to the magnetic energy , @xmath71 , as a result of the turbulence dynamo .",
    "the above formula is convoluted to the data of the simulation described in  1 , setting @xmath72 , and the strength of the igmfs is calculated as @xmath73 .",
    "the resulting magnetic field strength is presented in the bottom panels of figure 4 . on average",
    "the igmfs are stronger in hotter and denser regions .",
    "the strength of the igmfs is @xmath74 g inside clusters / groups ( the mass - averaged value for @xmath54 k ) , @xmath75 g around clusters / groups ( the volume - averaged value for @xmath54 k ) , and @xmath76 ng in filaments ( with @xmath55 k ) at present .",
    "the igmfs should be much weaker in sheetlike structures and voids .",
    "but as noted above , turbulence has not developed fully in such low density regions , so our model is not adequate to predict the field strength there .",
    "we note that in addition to the turbulence dynamo , other processes such as galactic winds driven by supernova explosions and jets from active galactic nuclei can further strengthen the magnetic fields to the igm ( for references , see * ? ? ?",
    "shocks are inevitable consequences of the formation of large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "they heat gas , accelerate cosmic - ray particles , produce vorticity and turbulence , and generate and amplify magnetic fields in the igm . by applying detailed models of the dsa and the turbulence dynamo to the data of a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of a concordance @xmath0cdm universe",
    ", we have made the following quantitative estimates : @xmath77 in the igm , @xmath78 in the icm , @xmath79 in filaments and sheets , @xmath74 g inside clusters / groups , @xmath80 g around clusters / groups , and @xmath81 ng in filaments at present .",
    "our results suggest that the non - thermal components can be energetically significant in the intergalactic plasma of large - scale structure , as in the interstellar plasma inside our galaxy .",
