    "in recent years , transport properties in unconventional superconductor junctions have been studied both theoretically and experimentally . in these junctions , a zero energy state ( zes )",
    "@xcite formed at the junction interface plays an important role in the tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "it is now well known the zes is responsible for zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) in the high - t@xmath7 superconductor junctions  @xcite and related phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies clearly relate the formation of the zes to the zbcp in tunneling spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "since the formation of the zes is a general phenomenon in unconventional superconductor junctions , the zbcp is also expected in spin - triplet superconductor junctions   @xcite .",
    "actually , the zbcp has been observed in junctions of sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6  @xcite and ube@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the zbcp has also been theoretically predicted for organic superconductors ( tmtsf)@xmath9x very recently   @xcite",
    ".    from a view of future device application , transport properties in hybrid structures consist of ferromagnets and superconductors have attached much attention .",
    "it was pointed out in ferromagnet / insulator / spin - singlet unconventional superconductor ( f / i / s ) junctions that the amplitude of the zbcp decreases with increasing the magnitude of the exchange potential in ferromagnets .",
    "this is because the exchange potential breaks the time - reversal symmetry and suppresses the retro - reflectivity of the andreev reflection  @xcite .",
    "thus the zbcp is sensitive to the degree of spin - polarization in ferromagnets .",
    "since the tunneling conductance is independent of the magnitude of the insulating barrier  @xcite , it is possible to estimate the spin - polarization in ferromagnets through the temperature dependence of the zbcp .",
    "an experimental test would be carried out in la@xmath10sr@xmath11mno@xmath12/yba@xmath5cu@xmath12o@xmath13 junctions in near future  @xcite .    when spin - triplet superconductors are attached to ferromagnets  @xcite ,",
    "the zbcp depends not only on the spin - polarization also on other parameters such as relative angles between the @xmath0-vector in triplet superconductors and the magnetic moment in ferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "thus it may be possible to know details of the pair potential by comparing the characteristic feature of the zbcp in theoretical calculations and those in experiments .",
    "for this purpose , it is necessary to know effects of another ingredients such as temperatures and the profile of the pair potential near the junction interface on the zbcp .",
    "it is known that the amplitude of pair potential is drastically suppressed at a surface or a interface of superconductors in the presence of the zes  @xcite .",
    "although there are several studies on tunneling phenomena in ferromagnet / unconventional superconductor junctions so far @xcite , such issues have never been addressed yet .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the tunneling conductance in ferromagnet / unconventional superconductor junctions as a function of temperatures and degrees of spin - polarization in ferromagnets , where the spatial dependence of the pair potential is determined self - consistently based on the quasiclassical green s function theory .",
    "we choose @xmath0-wave , and @xmath14-wave symmetries for the pair potentials which are candidates for pairing symmetries of high-@xmath15 cuprates and sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6 , respectively . for comparison",
    ", we also study the conductance in @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave superconductor junctions . from the calculated results , we reach the following conclusions .",
    "\\(1 ) in @xmath0-wave junctions with ( 110 ) orientation and @xmath2-wave junctions , an incident quasiparticle from a ferromagnet always feels the zes irrespective of the incident angles .",
    "the zero - bias tunneling conductance ( zbc ) at the zero temperature is insensitive to the barrier potential at the interface .",
    "this result indicates a possibility to estimate the magnitude of the spin - polarization of ferromagnets at sufficiently low temperatures ( @xmath16 ) in experiments .",
    "( 2)in @xmath0-wave junctions with ( 110 ) orientation and @xmath2-wave junctions , the zbc monotonically decreases with increasing temperatures for small magnitudes of spin - polarization . on the other hand for large magnitudes of polarization ,",
    "the zbc becomes an increasing function of temperatures .",
    "while for @xmath0-wave junctions with ( 100 ) orientation and @xmath3-wave junctions , where the zes does not appear , the zbc is an increasing function of @xmath16 independent of the spin - polarization . for @xmath4-wave junctions , the zbc first decreases with increasing @xmath16 then increases .",
    "( 3)for @xmath1-wave junctions , the zbc has various temperature dependence depending on the direction of the magnetic moment in ferromagnets .",
    "this unique property is peculiar to spin - triplet superconductors .",
    "\\(4 ) throughout this paper , we calculate the zbc in two ways ; i ) the spatial dependence of the pair potential is assumed to be the step function ( non - scf calculation ) , ii ) the spatial depletion of the pair potentials is determined self - consistently ( scf - calculation ) . by comparing the conductance in the two ways , we found that the results in the non - scf calculation are qualitatively the same with those in the scf - calculation .",

    ", the effects of the spatial dependence of the pair potentials on the conductance are not be negligible  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the polarization and temperature dependence of the zero - bias conductance ( zbc ) in f / i / s junctions , where we have chosen the symmetry of the pair potential as @xmath0-wave for high @xmath15 cuprates and @xmath4-wave for sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6 . as a reference",

    "the @xmath83 dependence of the tunneling conductance only appears in the spin - triplet superconductor junctions . on the basis of the numerical results , we reach the following conclusions .",
    "\\(1 ) when injected quasiparticles from ferromagnets always feel the zero - energy resonance state , @xmath130 , @xmath0-wave junction with ( 110 ) orientation and @xmath2-wave junction , the zero - bias tunneling conductance ( zbc ) at the zero temperature is insensitive to the barrier potential at the interface .",
    "this property is useful for the determination of the degree of the spin - polarization in ferromagnets at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "one of the promising candidate is lasrmno / ybacuo(bisrcacuo ) with well oriented ( 110 ) oriented interface . within our theory , below 0.1k we can estimate the magnitude of polarization of ferromagnets through the value of the conductance of the junctions .",
    "\\(2 ) for @xmath0-wave junctions with ( 110 ) orientation and @xmath2-wave junctions , the zbc decreases with increasing temperatures when the degree of the polarization , @xmath114 , is small . for large @xmath114 , the zbc is an increasing function of @xmath16 .",
    "the presence of the zes explains these behavior . in @xmath0-wave junctions with ( 100 ) orientation and @xmath3-wave junctions ,",
    "the zbc is an increasing function of @xmath16 independent of @xmath114 .",
    "this is because the zes does not appear at these junction interface . for @xmath4-wave junctions ,",
    "the zbc first decreases with increasing @xmath16 then increases .",
    "\\(3 ) in @xmath1-wave junctions , the temperature dependence of the zbc depends on the direction of the magnetization axis of ferromagnets because of the spin degree of freedom of cooper pairs in spin - triplet superconductors .",
    "\\(4 ) throughout this paper , we have calculated the zbc in two ways ; i ) the spatial dependence of the pair potential is assumed to be the step function ( non - scf calculation ) , ii ) the spatial depletion of the pair potentials are determined self - consistently ( scf - calculation ) .",
    "we have confirmed that there are no remarkable differences between the conductance in the non - scf calculation and those in the scf calculation .    in this paper ,",
    "effects of random potentials in ferromagnets are not taken into account .",
    "recently , there are several works on random scattering effects in unconventional superconductor junctions  @xcite .",
    "it is actually interesting to study transport properties of junctions where diffusive ferromagnets are attached to unconventional superconductors . in the present paper ,",
