    "<S> we derive the finite size dependence of the clustering coefficient of scale - free random graphs generated by the configuration model with degree distribution exponent @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> degree heterogeneity increases the presence of triangles in the network up to levels that compare to those found in many real networks even for extremely large nets . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that for values of @xmath1 , clustering is virtually size independent and , at the same time , becomes a _ de facto _ non self - averaging topological property . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that a single instance network is not representative of the ensemble even for very large network sizes .    </S>",
    "<S> null models are critical to gauge the effect that randomness may have on the properties of systems in the presence of noise . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to have the maximum understanding of the null model at hand , something not always easy to achieve . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case of the most used null model of random graphs , the configuration model ( cm )  @xcite    given a real network , the configuration model preserves the degree distribution of the real network , @xmath2 , whereas connections among nodes are realized in the most random way , always preserving the degree sequence either the real one or drawn from the distribution @xmath2 and avoiding multiple and self - connections . in principle , the cm generates graphs without any type of correlations among nodes . for this reason </S>",
    "<S> , it is widely used in network theory to determine whether the observed topological properties of the real network might be considered as the product of some non trivial principle shaping the evolution of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> this program is severely hindered when the network contains nodes with degrees above the structural cut - off @xmath3  @xcite , where @xmath4 is the average degree and @xmath5 the size of the network . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case of scale - free networks with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and a natural cut - off @xmath8 most often found in real complex networks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this apparently simple null model develops all sort of anomalous behaviors in this case , e. g. , the appearance of strong non - trivial degree correlations among nodes  @xcite , difficulties in the sampling of the configuration space  @xcite , or the presence of phase transitions between graphical and non - graphical phases  @xcite , to name just a few .    </S>",
    "<S> clustering or the presence of triangles in the network is yet another example of anomalous behavior associated to the cm . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of clustering as a topological property is related to the fact that nearly all known real complex networks have a very large number of triangles whereas the cm has a vanishingly small number in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the absence of triangles is convenient from a theoretical point of view as it allows us to use generating functions techniques to solve many interesting problems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , given the empirical observations , it seems to be a quite unrealistic assumption . </S>",
    "<S> this has led to the common understanding that clustering observed in real networks can not be explained by the cm and , thus , is the product of some underlying principle . while we fully agree with this statement , in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show that it must be taken with care . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , depending on the heterogeneity of @xmath2 , the cm can generate , on average , nearly size - independent levels of clustering . </S>",
    "<S> besides , in such cases , sample - to - sample fluctuations do not vanish when @xmath9 , meaning that the same degree sequence may generate either very high or very low levels of clustering , independently of the network size .    </S>",
    "<S> clustering can be quantified using different metrics  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we use the average clustering coefficient @xmath10 , defined as the average ( over nodes of degree @xmath11 ) of the local clustering coefficient of single nodes @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the number of triangles attached to node @xmath14 . in the absence of high degree nodes , </S>",
    "<S> the clustering coefficient of a random graph generated by the cm is given by  @xcite @xmath15 and , therefore , vanishes very fast in the large system size . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason why the tree - like character of networks generated by the cm has always been taken for granted . </S>",
    "<S> however , eq .  ( [ clustering1 ] ) is clearly incorrect when the degree distribution is scale - free , as it predicts a behavior @xmath16 that diverges for @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ clustering1 ] ) fails in this case because its derivation does not account for the structural correlations among degrees of connected nodes . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the correct scaling behavior of the clustering coefficient for scale - free random graphs with @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the cm , as originally defined , defines a micro - canonical ensemble , in the sense that the degree of every single node is given a priori and , once the degree sequence is fully known , the network is assembled in the most random way while preserving the degree sequence . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case of scale - free networks , this approach resists any analytic treatment . instead , here we adopt a different strategy and work with the canonical ensemble of the cm . in this ensemble , each node is given not its actual degree but its expected degree . </S>",
    "<S> this relaxes the topological conditions to close the network and opens the door to an analytic treatment . specifically , the model is defined as follows    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> each node is assigned a hidden variable @xmath18 drawn from the probability density @xmath19 with @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the cut - off value @xmath21 is , in principle , arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> however , often @xmath21 is the so - called natural cut - off , defined as the expected maximum value out of a sample of @xmath5 random deviates given from the probability density @xmath22 . in the case of interest of a scale - free distribution , the natural cut - off scales as @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> each pair of nodes is visited once and connected with probability @xmath24 where @xmath18 and @xmath25 are the hidden variables associated to each node , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the expected minimum degree of the network . </S>",
    "<S> the particular form chosen for the connection probability ensures that the entropy of the ensemble is maximal  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that the average degree of a node with hidden variable @xmath18 is @xmath28  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can think of @xmath18 and @xmath22 as the degree and degree distribution , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> parameter @xmath29 is a structural cut - off defining the onset of structural correlations , that is , nodes with expected degrees below @xmath29 are connected with probability @xmath30 and , therefore , are uncorrelated at the level of degrees . as a consequence , the global level of correlations present in the system </S>",
    "<S> is controlled by the cut - off @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> whenever @xmath31 the resulting network is fully uncorrelated whereas for @xmath32 correlations are necessary to close it . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we are interested in the range @xmath33 .    using the formalism developed in@xcite , </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : clustering ] ) is of order @xmath40 , which goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> we can , thus , approach @xmath35 as @xmath41 which becomes independent of @xmath18 . </S>",

    "<S> this expression , although involved at first glance , it is convenient because in the range @xmath47 the arguments of the three transcendent lerch functions in it go to @xmath48 in the limit @xmath49 , in which case we know that @xmath50 for @xmath51 . we then find the asymptotic behavior @xmath52 2   \\psi(\\gamma ) \\ln{\\left(\\frac{\\kappa_c}{\\kappa_s } \\right ) } & \\kappa_c\\gg \\kappa_s\\gg 1 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : clustering ] ) , and the approximate solution given by eq.([clustering_main ] ) , showing a very nice agreement . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for @xmath60 , clustering remains nearly constant in the range of sizes @xmath65 and even increases slightly for small sizes . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the slow decay of the term @xmath66 combined with the diverging logarithmic term in the numerator and functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which diverges in the limit @xmath69 . in the inset of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this figure makes evident the extremely slow decay nearly absent with the system size . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that , in practice , clustering can not be removed from the network even in very large networks when @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is , thus , not clear whether the tree - like approximation , customarily used to solve problems on random graphs , can be applied in this case . in this situation </S>",
    "<S> , one should use alternative approaches , like the one developed in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results are particularly relevant due to the abundance of real networks with values of @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to study the behavior of clustering as a function of @xmath62 for a fixed network size . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2 ] shows this behavior for different values of @xmath5 . for each size </S>",
    "<S> , there is an optimal value of @xmath62 where clustering is maximal . in the case of @xmath56 and @xmath71 , </S>",
    "<S> there is critical value @xmath72 below which clustering increases with the network size up to a maximum and then slowly decreases .    up to this point , we have been concerned only with the ensemble average of the clustering coefficient </S>",
    "<S> . however , the cm ensemble shows strong sample - to - sample fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3 ] shows the probability density function of the clustering coefficient obtained out of a sample of @xmath58 different networks generated by the canonical version of the cm . </S>",
    "<S> as it can be observed , clustering may take values in the range @xmath73 $ ] quite easily . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3 ] also shows the standard deviation @xmath74 as a function of network size and for different values of @xmath62 . in all cases , fluctuations decay as a power law of the system size , @xmath63 , with an exponent @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for @xmath60 , the exponent @xmath64 takes a very small value ( @xmath76 ) that , when combined with the behavior of @xmath10 as a function of @xmath5 results in a coefficient of variation nearly constant . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that , in this range of values of @xmath62 , clustering is _ de facto _ a size - independent but non self - averaging property . </S>",
    "<S> that is , a single network instance is not a good representative of the ensemble even for very large network sizes .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of triangles in real networks play an important role in many processes taking place on top of them , e. g. , percolation phenomena , epidemic spreading , synchronization , etc . </S>",
    "<S> it is , therefore , important to have full control over the most simple network ensembles that are used as null models to assess the presence of underlying principles shaping the topology of the system . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we have found the correct scaling behavior of the clustering coefficient of the ensemble of scale - free random graphs with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for values of the exponent @xmath1 , clustering remains nearly constant up to extremely large network sizes . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case , clustering is not self - averaging . </S>",
    "<S> this means that when comparing real networks against the cm , it is not enough to generate a single instance network , as it may result in either a very low or high level of clustering even for very large network sizes . </S>",
    "<S> these results are particularly important as the exponent value @xmath1 seems to be for yet unknown reasons the rule rather than the exception in real systems . </S>"
