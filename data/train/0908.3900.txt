    "dpvs were discovered in the small magellanic cloud after a search for be stars in the ogle - ii database ( mennickent et al .",
    "they were clearly distinguished from other variables by showing 2 linked photometric cycles ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) . a spectroscopic monitoring of some of them allowed to associate the short periodicity to the orbital period of a binary ( mennickent et al .",
    "2005 ) whereas the long term variations were found to be reddish and non strictly constant ( mennickent , assman , & sabogal 2006 , michalska et al.2009 ) .    the current census of dpvs amounts to 114 in the magellanic clouds and 11 in our galaxy ( see magnitud - color and period - period diagrams in mennickent & koaczkowski 2009a ) .",
    "after the discovery of additional variability in v393sco ( pilecki & szczygiel 2007 ) , we recognized it as the first dpv in our galaxy .",
    "later we found that in the past an additional long cycle was also reported for the galactic dpv aumon ( lorenzi 1985 ) .",
    "both stars were also found during our independent search for galactic dpvs in the asas database .",
    "few dpvs have been studied in detail , but we can get insights on dpvs as a class based on well studied and representative cases . cumulative evidence indicates that dpvs are interacting binaries with a component ( the donor ) filling their roche lobe and transferring mass to the gainer ( the primary ) .",
    "broad and variable hei lines probably probe an accretion disc that sometimes hides the primary .",
    "hi ( sometimes hei ) line emission is the rule ( although usually not quite prominent ) .",
    "it is probable that the deeper dpv eclipse corresponds mostly to the occultation of the circumprimary disc .",
    "we observed a loop in the color - magnitude diagram of lmc - dpv1 during the long cycle that interpreted in terms of mass loss ( mennickent et al .",
    "2008 , hereafter m08 ) .",
    "the same star shows discrete pa@xmath3 and pa@xmath4 absorption components following a saw - teeth pattern with the orbital period indicating outflows through the outer lagrangian points ( m08 ) .",
    "the same phenomenon could explain the depressed blue wings observed in the hei 10833    infrared spectra of v393sco near secondary eclipse ( fig.1 ) .",
    "we observe ( minor ) variability in the shape of the light curve for v393sco during main minima that could indicate changes in the properties of the circumprimary disc .",
    "in addition , the h@xmath5 emission line strength increases during supercycle maximum ( mennickent & koaczkowski 2009b ) .",
    "most dpvs with 2mass data seems to show infrared excess . in the studied cases mass ratios ( donor / gainer ) are always less than one .",
    "all these singular characteristics , plus the presence of two distinct periodicities , suggest that dpvs can be observed as a new class of interacting binaries , at least from the observational point of view .",
    "we propose that dpvs are case - a / b mass transfer binaries after mass ratio reversal in algol - like configurations .",
    "they are more massive than ordinary algols ( mennickent & koaczkowski 2009a ) , so it is possible that the mass transfer rate is larger , and the primary is rotating at critical velocity . under these circumstances ,",
    "accretion is stopped and the disc starts cumulating mass that is periodically ejected from the system .",
    "our observations indicate that mass loss occurs permanently in dpvs , mainly through the outer lagrangian points .",
    "however , the long term periodicity implies that there is another clock governing mass loss in the long term .",
    "we believe that during the supercycle the disc cumulates extra matter that is is expelled from the binary during supermaximum .",
    "the remarkable behavior of hei in v393sco ( fig.2 ) suggests that the rotational velocity of the circumprimary disc is larger during supermaximum and modulated with supercycle phase .",
    "the mechanism for this supercycle is unknown .",
    "we analyzed the possibility that the disc outer radius grows until the 3:1 resonance radius and disc starts to precess , as happens in low mass ratio suuma stars ( mennickent & koaczkowski 2009a ) .",
    "in this view precession enhances mass loss into the interstellar medium .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath0 maintains the same orbital behavior during supercycle ( fig.2 ) suggests that there is no disc precession .",
    "other more speculative hypothesis is that the primary experiences instabilities around critical velocity , gaining extra momentum during accretion until attains a velocity just above the critical one , then relaxes below critical velocity giving the extra momentum to the disc that partly escapes from the binary .",
    "additional studies are needed to confirm this view .",
    "we have initiated a program to study dpvs with high resolution optical / infrared spectrographs and robotic telescopes with the aim of shedding light on this phenomenon .",
    "in table 1 we summarize our view for dpvs in the context of algols and w serpentid stars .",
    "it is possible that the critical velocity of the gainer can be maintained only until the mass of the donor ( @xmath6 ) drops to certain value . during this period of high mass transfer rate",
    "the star behaves as a w serpentid ( with a thick circumprimary disc and chaotic mass loss ) or as a dpv ( with slightly lower @xmath7 allowing the dpv instability to operate ) .",
    "when @xmath7 drops even more , tidal forces spin down the gainer , the orbital separation ( @xmath8 ) increases , and the system becomes a typical algol star . in algols mass transfer rate if present is comparatively small , partly due to the less massive donor and also to the larger @xmath8 . @xmath3",
    "lyr probably still is not a dpv , as suggested by their very small long period amplitude and position in the @xmath9 diagram ( fig.1 ) .",

    "they are always of concern in other galaxies . + _",
