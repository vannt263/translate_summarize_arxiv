    "furthermore , let @xmath42 be an initial condition `` @xmath48close '' to @xmath49 , for some @xmath50 . roughly speaking , this initial condition has length scale @xmath51 . we will consider external potentials , @xmath5 , as in , for a scaling parameter @xmath47 satisfying @xmath52 _ i.e. _ , we assume that the external potential varies very little over the length scale of @xmath42 . for simplicity , we choose @xmath53 and @xmath54 , at the price of re - scaling the nonlinearity .",

    "these conditions say that the perturbation @xmath55 is ` symplectically orthogonal ' to the soliton manifold @xmath35 .    the main idea used to control the perturbation @xmath55 is to derive differential equations in time for the modulation parameters , @xmath27 , which depend on the external potential .",
    "these equations appear naturally when one projects solutions of onto the soliton manifold .",
    "to control the motions of @xmath27 and @xmath55 , we make use of conserved quantities : the energy @xmath57 where @xmath58 ( this is a variational derivative ) , the mass ( or charge ) @xmath59 and the `` almost conserved '' momentum @xmath60 to achieve control over the perturbation @xmath55 , we introduce a ` lyapunov functional ' @xmath61 where @xmath62 , and where @xmath63 _ i.e. _ , @xmath64 is essentially a linear combination of the conserved and almost conserved quantities . using the linear transformation @xmath65 , we change questions about the size of fluctuations around @xmath66 to ones about the size of fluctuations around the solitary wave profile @xmath67 . in this",
    "`` moving frame '' , the @xmath68 terms in the lyapunov functional introduced above take the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the moving frame the lyapunov functional depends on the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath72 , but not on @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath20 is a critical point of @xmath75 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath76 . the change of frame discussed above simplifies the analysis leading to our main result",

    "furthermore , the center of mass of the solitary wave , @xmath72 , and the center of mass momentum @xmath73 satisfy the following equations @xmath79 the remaining modulation parameters @xmath25 and @xmath74 satisfy @xmath80 a precise statement is found in the next section .",
    "this is the first result of its type covering _ confining _ external potentials .",
    "indeed , we can exploit the confining nature of the potential to obtain a _",
    "result than that of @xcite ( and that stated above ) for a certain class of initial conditions which we now describe .",
    "consider the classical hamiltonian function : @xmath81 given an initial condition @xmath42 @xmath48close to @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , we require the initial position @xmath84 and momentum @xmath85 to satisfy @xmath86 with @xmath87 , for some constant @xmath88 .",
    "for this class of initial conditions , our main result shows that the perturbation @xmath55 remains @xmath89 for longer times : @xmath90 this improvement is non - trivial .",
    "for example , it means that we can control the perturbation of a solitary wave which undergoes many oscillations near the bottom of a potential well .",
    "* remark : * we can also extend our analysis to a class of slowly time - dependent external potentials without much additional work .",

    "can , in fact , survive for arbitrarily long times .",

    "for details see appendix [ sec : fam ] .",
    "the first results of the above type , for bounded , time - independent potentials were proved in @xcite for the hartree equation under a spectral assumption .",
    "this result was later extended to a general class of nonlinearities in @xcite .",
    "neither of these works deals with a confining external potential .",
    "in particular , their results do not extend to the longer time interval  ( [ eq : longer ] ) described above .    for local pure - power nonlinearities and a small parameter @xmath47 ,",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that if an initial condition is of the form @xmath105 , then the solution @xmath106 of eq .",
    "satisfies @xmath107 in the @xmath108 topology ( dual to @xmath109 ) , provided @xmath110 satisfies the equation @xmath111 , where @xmath112 .",
    "this result was strengthened in @xcite for a bounded external potential and in @xcite for a potential given by a quadratic polynomial in @xmath113 .",
    "there have been many recent works on asymptotic properties for generalized nonlinear schrdinger equations .",
    "asymptotic stability , scattering and asymptotic completeness of solitary waves for bounded external potential tending to 0 at @xmath114 has been shown under various assumptions .",
    "see for example , @xcite .",
    "though these are all - time results , where ours is long ( but finite)-time , our approach has some advantages : we can handle confining potentials ( for which the above - described results are meaningless ) ; we require a much less stringent ( and verifiable ) spectral condition ; we track the finite - dimensional soliton dynamics ( newton equations ) ; and our methods are comparatively elementary .    our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ass ] , we state our hypotheses and the main result . in section  [ sec:2 ] , we recall the hamiltonian nature of eq .   and describe symmetries of for @xmath17 .",
