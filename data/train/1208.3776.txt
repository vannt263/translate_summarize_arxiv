    "the purpose of this section is to explain informally the nature of the results that will be stated in detail and greater generality in the course of the paper .",
    "a type of idealized multi - scattering experiment is depicted in figure [ multiscattering ] .",
    "the figure represents the flight of a molecule between two parallel solid plates . at each collision",
    ", the molecule impinges on the surface of a plate with a velocity @xmath10 and , after interacting with the surface in some way ( which will be explicitly described by a mechanical model ) , it scatters away with a post - collision velocity @xmath11 . the single scattering event @xmath12 , for some specified molecule - surface interaction model , is given by a random map in the following sense .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the half - space of vectors @xmath13 with negative third component .",
    "it is convenient to also regard the scattered velocity @xmath11 as a vector in @xmath7 by identifying vectors that differ only by the sign of their third component . a scattering event",
    "is then represented by a map from @xmath7 into the space of probability measures on @xmath7 , which we call for now the _ scattering map _ ; the probability measure associated to @xmath10 is the law of the random variable @xmath11 .",
    "thus the scattering map encodes the `` microscopic '' mechanism of molecule - surface interaction in the form of a random map , whose iteration provides the information about velocities needed to determine the sample trajectories of the molecule .",
    "the mechanical - geometric interaction models specifying the scattering map will be limited in this paper to what we call a mechanical system of _ billiard type_. essentially , it is a conservative classical mechanical system without `` soft '' potentials .",
    "interactions between moving masses ( comprising the `` wall sub - system '' and the `` molecule sub - system , '' using the language of @xcite ) are billiard - like elastic collisions .     and @xmath11 , respectively , as the pre- and post - scattering velocities at a collision event , and regard @xmath11 as a random function of @xmath10 , as explained in the text.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]     an example of a very simple interaction mechanism ( in dimension @xmath14 ) is shown in figure [ movingwall ] .",
    "that figure can be thought to represent a choice of wall `` microstructure . ''",
    "in addition to a choice of mechanical system representing the wall microstructure , the specification of a scattering map requires fixing a statistical kinetic state of this microstructure prior to each collision . for the example of figure [ movingwall ]",
    ", one possible specification may be as follows : ( 1 ) the precise position on the horizontal axis ( the dashed line of the figure ) where the molecule enters the zone of interaction is random , uniformly distributed over the period of the periodic surface contour ; ( 2 ) at the same time that the molecule crosses the dashed line ( which arbitrarily sets the boundary of the interaction zone ) , the position and velocity of the up - and - down moving wall are chosen randomly from prescribed probability distributions .",
    "the most natural are the uniform distribution ( over a small interval ) for the position , and a one - dimensional normal distribution for the velocity , with mean zero and constant variance .",
    "( the variance specifies the wall temperature , as will be seen . ) in fact , one general assumption of the main theorems essentially amounts to the constituent masses of the wall sub - system having velocities which are normally distributed and in a state of equilibrium ( specifically , energy equipartition is assumed ) . in this respect , a random - mechanical model of `` heat bath ''",
    "is explicitly given .",
    "once the random pre - collision conditions are set , the mechanical system describing the interaction evolves deterministically to produce @xmath11 .",
    "note that a single collision event may consist of several `` billiard collisions '' at the `` microscopic level . ''",
    "having specified a scattering map ( by the choices of a mechanical system and the constant pre - collision statistical state of the wall ) , a random dynamical system on @xmath7 is defined , which can then be studied from the perspective of the theory of markov chains on general state spaces ( @xcite ) .    clearly , one can equally well envision a multiple scattering set - up similar to the one depicted in figure [ multiscattering ] but inside a cylindrical channel or a spherical container rather than two parallel plates ; or , more generally , inside a solid container of irregular shape , in which case a `` random change of frames '' operator must be composed with the scattering operator to account for the changing orientation of the inner surface of the container at different collision points .",
    "( see @xcite .",
    "this is not needed in the case of plates , cylinders , and spheres . )",
    "we like to think of this general set - up as defining a _ random billiard system _ , an idea that is nicely illustrated by @xcite , for example .",
    "we are particularly interested in situations that exhibit weak scattering , in the sense that the probability distribution of @xmath11 is concentrated near @xmath10 or , what amounts to the same thing , the scattering is nearly specular .",
    "our systems will typically depend on a parameter @xmath2 that indicates the strength of the scattering , and we are mainly concerned with the limit of the velocity ( markov ) process as @xmath2 approaches @xmath3 .",
    "this will lead to novel types of diffusion processes canonically associated with the underlying mechanical systems .",
    "we call @xmath2 the _ flatness _ parameter for reasons that will soon become obvious .    for the systems of billiard type considered here",
    "( introduced in section [ billiardtypesection ] ) , the essential information concerning their mechanical and probabilistic definition is contained in two linear maps : @xmath15 and @xmath16 on @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of `` hidden '' independent variables ( whose statistical states are prescribed by the model ) and @xmath19 is the number of `` observed '' variables ( say , the @xmath20 velocity coordinates of the molecule in the situation of figure [ multiscattering ] ) .",
    "this @xmath19 is also the general dimension of @xmath7 .",
    "vectors in @xmath7 will be written @xmath21 .",
    "the maps @xmath15 and @xmath16 are non - negative definite and hermitian ; @xmath15 is a covariance matrix for the hidden velocities and , by the equipartition assumption , it is a scalar multiple of an orthogonal projection , while @xmath16 contains ( in the limit @xmath22 ) information about the system geometry and mass distribution .",
    "the first observation ( which is studied in much greater generality in @xcite ) is that the resulting markov chain on velocity space @xmath7 has canonical stationary distributions given by what we refer to as the _ post - collision _ maxwell - boltzmann distribution of velocities .",
    "( the term `` post - collision '' is used to distinguish it from the more commonly known distribution of velocities sampled at random times , not necessarily on the wall surface . )",
    "this velocity distribution has the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the restriction of @xmath16 to the subspace of `` hidden velocities , '' and @xmath26 denotes euclidean volume element .",
    "the scattering map can be represented as a ( very generally ) self - adjoint operator on @xmath27 of norm @xmath28 , which we indicate by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the flatness parameter .",
    "we denote the density of @xmath29 by @xmath30 the term @xmath31 in @xmath32 equals the speed times the cosine of the angle between @xmath10 and the normal to the scattering surface ; this cosine factor is often referred to in the applied literature as the _ knudsen cosine law . _",

    "a sample path of a legendre diffusion process is illustrated in figure [ legendre ] .",

    "for our purposes , a system of _ billiard type _ is a mechanical system defined by the geodesic motion of a point particle in a riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath69 with piecewise smooth boundary . upon hitting the boundary ,",

    "<S> this measure s density is either ( post - collision ) maxwell - boltzmann distribution or knudsen cosine law , and the random processes with infinitesimal generator @xmath5 respectively correspond to what we call _ mb diffusion _ and ( generalized ) _ legendre diffusion_. concrete examples of simple mechanical systems are given and illustrated by numerically simulating the random processes . </S>"
