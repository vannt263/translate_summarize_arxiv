    "the quest for lower temperatures in ultracold gases has lead to the development of many ingenious techniques to cool several atomic and molecular species .",
    "in particular , the explosion of activity concerning ultracold fermi gases has become possible largely owing to the success of sympathetic cooling , which allows to efficiently cool fermions by mixing them with bosons  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", this procedure has stimulated the investigation , both experimental and theoretical , of bose - fermi mixtures . here , the possibility of tuning the inter - species interaction strength using feshbach resonances  @xcite , has led to the exploration of many interesting phenomena such as collapse and phase separation  @xcite , as well as boson - mediated cooper pairing  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , feshbach resonances can also be used to generate heteronuclear molecules , which can exhibit large electric dipole moments .",
    "this opens the interesting possibility of studying dipole - dipole interactions in quantum degenerate gases  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the advent of optical - lattice confinement  @xcite has turned ultracold atomic gases into unique environments where to simulate and understand strongly correlated phenomena relevant to condensed matter systems .",
    "this has been made it possible , for example , by confining the atomic clouds in reduced dimensions , such as a one dimensional ( 1d ) array of two - dimensional ( 2d ) planes or a 2d array of 1d tubes .",
    "whereas the former has enabled the study of interesting phenomena occurring in two - dimensions  @xcite , the latter has provided us with an amazingly tunable tool to explore the physics of interacting 1d quantum systems  @xcite , of which it is much more difficult to find faithful realizations in a more conventional condensed matter context .",
    "array of one - dimensional ( 1d ) tubes of length @xmath2 .",
    "the fermions are light enough to hop between the tubes whereas bosons , which are assumed to be much heavier , are confined in the 1d tubes .",
    "the bosonic and fermionic wannier functions ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ) are also displayed .",
    "]    optical lattice confinement has also allowed to envisage the realization of new types of quantum systems .",
    "one such example , analyzed in this work , is provided by mixtures of interacting particles in mixed - dimensional lattices . in recent years",
    ", these systems have attracted an increasing amount of theoretical attention  @xcite , and very recently they have been also experimentally realized  @xcite . besides its intrinsic interest as a new category of quantum many - body systems , they may also offer advantages for reducing few - body losses and enhancing stability in strongly interacting regimes  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there has been a growing interest in understanding the properties of mixtures of ultracold bose and fermi gases . in particular , binary mixtures of bosons and spin - polarized fermions",
    "have been studied in three - dimensions ( 3d )  @xcite , 2d  @xcite and 1d  @xcite .",
    "note that the 1d geometry has a special relevance because of the central role played by quantum fluctuations and the fact that there is neither broken continuous symmetry nor , consequently , off - diagonal long - range order .",
    "the equilibrium phase diagram of 1d bose - fermi mixtures has been considered by many authors  @xcite , while the case of a bose - fermi system in an anisotropic optical lattices was studied by one of us in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to dimensionality issues , the significant interest in studying the stability of binary mixtures comes also from the possibility of tuning the bose - fermi scattering length via the feshbach resonance mechanism .",
    "indeed , in the repulsive interaction regime , the spatial overlap between bosons and spin - polarized fermions is reduced , thus ensuring the stability of the system  @xcite .",
    "when the repulsion is increased , the two components tend instead to phase separate , rather than uniformly mix : in the particular case of a 3d geometry , phase separation occurs either between a mixed phase and a purely fermionic phase or between two pure phases  @xcite . in the regime where the interaction between bosons and fermions is attractive , a significant reduction of the interatomic distance can lead to a collapse of the mixture , because of three - body recombination processes  @xcite . as discussed later , the stability of the mixture towards a collapsed phase can be enhanced in one - dimensional geometries  @xcite .    in this article , we study the phase stability of a bose - fermi mixture embedded in a mixed - dimensional optical lattice of an array of one - dimensional tubes  @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schem ] ) .",
    "the mixed - dimensionality comes from the fact that , while bosons are longitudinally confined along the tubes and strictly move in 1d , fermions are not constrained to 1d and are allowed to hop between tubes in the transverse directions .",
    "this assumption can be justified based on the fact that many realizations of bose - fermi mixtures consider bosonic species that are much heavier than the fermionic ones .",
    "we do also assume that , while bosons interact with each other , as well as with fermions , the fermionic component is polarized in a single hyperfine state and thus is non - interacting at very low temperatures .    as already mentioned , one motivation to study this geometry is that , by confining bosons in 1d , the mixture stability is enhanced  @xcite .",
    "note that , even for purely bosonic gases , the spatial overlap between bosons has been experimentally shown to be strongly suppressed by the strong correlations emerging in 1d  @xcite .",
    "in addition , mixed - dimensional systems allow to study interesting few - body  @xcite and many - body  @xcite phenomena .",
    "we should stress that the results reported here are relevant to several experimental realizations .",
    "the simplest is , for example , a mixture of light fermions and heavy bosons . in particular , in order to make contact with ongoing and future experiments  @xcite , we explicitly consider a mixture of @xmath5li ( a light fermion ) and @xmath6yb ( a heavy boson ) atoms .",
    "an alternative realization could be given by an originally imbalanced mixture of fermions in two hyperfine states  @xcite : bosons are then formed by associating fermions into feshbach molecules  @xcite , leaving out from the pairing the spin polarized excess majority fermions . when the fermions belong to the same atomic species , the feshbach molecules have twice the mass and twice the polarizability of the fermionic atoms .",
    "therefore , it should be relatively easy to confine the bosons in 1d by loading them into a two - dimensional optical lattice . on the same lattice ,",
    "the remaining majority fermions behave as the light component .",
    "we find that , since bosons are confined to strictly 1d , they can undergo fermionization .",
    "this means that , as they mix with fermions , they form a tonks - girardeau gas whose energy per unit length grows as third power of the lineal density . as a result",
    ", we find that the nature of the transition from the pure fermi gas to a mixture is always first order , implying phase separation in density space .",
    "note that this is a very different result from the one obtained by assuming that bosons form a ( quasi-)condensate , with the energy density growing as the square of the boson lineal density .",
    "the latter situation applies either to a high density bose gas in 1d or to a gas of bosons that can hop in 3d .",
    "we also find that , in the mixed dimensionality lattice , the transition between pure boson and mixed phases is continuous , while it becomes first order when the fermions are also confined in 1d .",

    "the sign of the bose - fermi interaction strength is determined by @xmath20 , which can be controlled independently from @xmath19 by resorting to an inter - species feshbach resonance . below we consider both the repulsive ( @xmath21 ) as well as the attractive ( @xmath22 ) case . at ultracold temperatures , interactions between identical fermions can be safely neglected .",
    "the bose - fermi mixture is loaded into an anisotropic optical lattice formed by a 2d @xmath23 square array of 1d `` tubes '' of length @xmath2 directed along the @xmath24-direction and equally spaced by a distance @xmath25 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schem ] ) . this can be described by an optical potential of the form @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 .",
    "the strength of the optical potential @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is determined by both the laser intensity and the boson ( fermion ) atomic polarizability , allowing the possibility of mixed dimensionality for the mixture .",
    "in particular , we assume that the bosons are tightly confined in 1d tubes and thus move strictly in 1d , while fermions can hop between the tubes",
    ". we will derive the thermodynamic phase diagram for this geometry , thus neglecting the harmonic confinement . by making use of the local density approximation , information about the experimentally relevant trapped case",
    "can be extracted from the homogeneous phase diagram plotted in chemical potential space .    because the bosons in the mixture are assumed to be more massive than fermions and/or to experience a more confining lattice potential @xmath30 , they are tightly confined along the `` tubes '' ,",

    "the ground state properties of such an interacting bosonic gas are exactly described by the bethe ansatz solution obtained by lieb and liniger  @xcite .",
    "the lack of individuality and the highly correlated behavior brought about by the 1d confinement calls for a treatment of the problem that treats the boson - boson interactions in a non - perturbative way .",
    "since a mean - field approximation fails to capture the fundamental bosonic correlations in 1d , we apply it only to the interactions between the fermions and the bosons , as we explain in what follows .      in order to render the above model",
    "tractable , we apply a mean - field approximation to the bose - fermi interaction term .",
    "we do this in such a way that the different 1d tubes become decoupled at the expense of introducing self - consistent shifts of both the boson and fermion chemical potentials . to this end , we first observe that the tight confinement of the bosons in 1d allows us to neglect the overlap between wannier functions localized at different 1d tubes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] ) and thus we can approximate the density operator of the bosons as @xmath53 in this limit , the bose - fermi interaction term @xmath54 of the hamiltonian   can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a projection of the 3d fermi density operator @xmath57 on the @xmath58-th tube : @xmath59 we note that this approximation does not decouple the different tubes yet because , even if bosons can not hop from one tube to another , the interaction between bosons belonging to different tubes is mediated by the hopping fermions , i.e. , the operator @xmath56 .",
    "however , if we rely on a mean - field approximation to replace the operator @xmath56 by its expectation value ( which , as shown in detail in app .",
    "[ app : avera ] , is a constant ) , the different tubes become decoupled , which allows for a solution of the model introduced above .",
    "we emphasize again that this kind of mean - field approximation is different from the standard treatment ( for example employed in ref .",

    "the boson interaction is treated non - perturbatively using the bethe ansatz , emphasizing that the fundamental entities subject to the mean - field interaction are the 1d tubes and not the bosons themselves .    thus , in eq .",

    "bottom panel : for an attractive mixture there is neither a triple point nor a tricritical point , rather the first order line crosses the second order line at two critical end - points ( filled [ red ] diamond ) delimiting the region of phase separation between the vacuum and a mixed phase . ]      next , we focus on the pure 1d limit , i.e. , the limit where the fermions , like the bosons , can not hop between the tubes ( i.e. @xmath175 ) . the phase diagram in chemical potential resulting from minimizing the free energy is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phas3 ] , for both repulsive and attractive bose - fermi interactions .",
    "it can be seen that , in the pure 1d limit , for both repulsive and attractive interspecies interactions , all transitions ( except for the trivial ones from the vacuum phase ) are discontinuous . in particular , the transition between the pure boson to the mixed phases , which was found to be continuous in the mixed dimensional system , becomes discontinuous as soon as the fermions are confined to 1d .",
    "[ app : fermi ] we carry on an expansion for small fermion density that allows us to establish the nature of the phase transitions where the number of fermi surfaces changes from zero to one .",
    "as shown there , the main difference between the mixed - dimensional case illustrated in the previous section and the pure 1d limit analyzed here can be traced down to the different scaling of the fermi kinetic energy with the lineal fermion density @xmath177 in 1d and 3d .",
    "in particular , whereas in 1d the fermi kinetic energy scales as @xmath178 , in 3d it scales more slowly as @xmath179 .    furthermore , similarly to what was found in the previous section , the fermionization of bosons in 1d also renders the transition between the pure fermion and mixed phases discontinuous .",
    "these results are compatible with the previous results obtained by das in ref .",
    "@xcite , where was found that the transition between the pure boson and fermion phases is discontinuous thus leading to phase separation .",
    "the main difference between the repulsive and the attractive cases is the way the transitions across which the density of fermions changes connect with the transition between the pure fermion and mixed phase .",
    "in particular , in the repulsive case ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phas3 ] ) , the three first order transition lines ( thick red solid curves ) between pure boson - pure fermion , pure fermion - mixed , and pure boson - mixed phases meet at a triple point ( filled violet square symbol ) . at this triple point ,",
    "the three phases coexist since the free energy exhibits three degenerate local minima ( see fig .  [ fig : freen ] ) . on the other hand , for the attractive case ( see lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phas3 ] ) , the triple point is absent .",
    "instead , two critical end points ( filled red diamonds ) appear . in the density phase diagram , the critical end points delimit a triangularly - shaped region ( see bottom panel of fig .  [ fig : denzt ] ) , where phase separation occurs between the vacuum and mixed phases . similarly to conclusion reached in ref .",
    "@xcite , this region can be regarded as a remnant of the collapse that occurs in the absence of a lattice in 3d bose - fermi mixtures with sufficiently large attractive interactions  @xcite .",
    "let us finally remark that 1d bose - fermi mixtures in the exactly solvable limit of equal masses ( i.e. @xmath180 ) and equal interactions strengths ( @xmath181 have been analyzed in ref .",

    "@xcite concluded that the system is always stable against demixing .",
    "however , in this work , by _ globally minimizing _ the system free energy , i.e. , by looking for the global energy minima , we find that phase separation occurs in a rather broad region of the density phase diagram and , in particular , it always occurs for small bosons and fermion densities in the pure 1d limit .",

    "bottom panel : in contrast , for the attractive case , there is no phase separation between pure phases , rather , it exists a region of phase separation between the vacuum and a mixed phase . ]",
    "to summarize , we have studied the equilibrium phase diagram of a bose - fermi system in a mixed - dimensional geometry of an array of coupled 1d tubes , where bosons are strongly localized along the 1d tubes , while fermions can hop between the tubes .",
    "because we treat the boson interaction term non - perturbatively using the bethe ansatz , we have found that the transition between the pure fermi phase and the mixed phase is always first order .",
    "this implies that , for this system , phase separation can take place between a pure fermion and a mixed phase .",
    "however , the phase transition between pure boson and mixed phases is found to be continuous for finite hoping amplitude of the fermions and phase separation can not take place between these two phases .",
    "this contrasts with the results obtained by assuming that the bosons form a quasi - condensate and thus applying a standard mean - field treatment where the boson density is replaced with its expectation value  @xcite . in that case , the free energy the transition between the pure fermion and a mixed phases can be continuous as well as discontinuous , depending on the system parameters .    in the pure 1d limit",
    ", we found that the all transitions are first order , except for the trivial ones between the vacuum state and the pure fermion or boson phases .",
    "the main differences introduced by the sign of the interaction are the existence of a triple point for repulsive interactions , and the appearance of two critical end points delimiting a first order line between the mixed and the vacuum phases .",
    "thus , the main difference between the 1d limit and the mixed dimensional system is the change in the character of the transition between the pure boson and mixed phases .",
    "we have argued ( see app .",
    "[ app : fermi ] ) that this difference is a consequence of the different scaling of the fermi gas kinetic energy contribution to the free energy function with the fermion density .    before commenting on the relevance of our findings for the experiments using @xmath0yb-@xmath1li mixtures , it is interesting to note that , because we have applied the bethe ansatz to the 1d bose hamiltonian @xmath68  , we can extend our analysis to to fermi - fermi system consisting of a light and a heavy atom .",
    "in fact , in the limit @xmath188 where @xmath189 , the boson energy , @xmath83 becomes identical to that of a free fermi gas  @xcite . by taking this limit of the bethe - energy in eq .  , we found that the phase diagrams for both repulsive and attractive fermi - fermi interactions evaluated in the same way as before are qualitatively similar to those displayed in fig .",

    "the actual experimental systems are rendered inhomogeneous by the existence of harmonic trapping .",
    "for mixed dimensionality systems , in general , and the @xmath0yb-@xmath1li system  @xcite loaded in an anisotropic optical lattice in particular , we can rely on the local density approximation and deduce the main implications for experiments from the phase diagrams in the chemical potential space shown in fig .",

    "this range determines a region in the chemical phase diagram that contains the possible phases that will coexist in the trap .",
    "lastly , we comment on the accuracy of the above mean - field approach that we have employed for the bose - fermi interaction term .",
    "indeed , as any other mean - field theory , it neglects fluctuations .",
    "we expect fluctuations to be especially important close to a phase transition . nevertheless , as shown later in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase ] , our calculations indicate that many of the phase transitions in the mixed dimensionality bose - fermi system ( cf .",
    "[ sec : mixdi ] ) and in the pure 1d limit are discontinuous .",
    "this means that , even very close to the transition point , fluctuations of the boson and fermion densities are typically suppressed and thus it can be expected that the mean - field theory to give a reliable picture .",
    "however , we also numerically observed that some of the transitions are only weakly first order . in other cases , however , the transition was found to be continuous .",
    "therefore a careful assessment of the effect of fluctuations will be required but will not be pursued here .",
    "furthermore , within the above mean - field approach , we also have neglected the inter - tube couplings as well as the effect of the bosons on the fermion properties , which are as a non - interacting fermi gas .",

    ", we have assumed that such effects are relatively weak and can only become important only for large values @xmath194 and/or very low temperatures that may not be easily achievable under current experimental conditions .    beyond the assessment the accuracy of the present mean - field approach , another interesting direction is to apply the methods developed here to mixed dimensionality systems where the 1d bosons interact via longer range interactions , such as dipolar gases or are tuned to the so - called the super - tonks regime  @xcite .",

    "therefore , eq .   reads : @xmath200 where @xmath201 , @xmath177 is the 1d density of fermions  , and @xmath202 in this derivation , we have used the fact that the boson wannier orbital @xmath203 is strongly localized around @xmath204 , thus we have neglected the contributions of the terms @xmath205 and @xmath206 different from @xmath58 , because the corresponding wavefunction overlaps are negligible .",
    "note also that the constant @xmath207   does not depend on the tube index @xmath58 .",
    "further , we can approximate @xmath208 and @xmath209 with @xmath210 , therefore the constant @xmath207 is given by : @xmath211    taking into account that the mean - field averages of the boson and fermion densities are given by the expressions  , in order to obtain the final expression of the hamiltonian , eq .  , we need to deal with@xmath212",
    "in this appendix we want to carry on an expansion for small fermion density so that to be able to establish the nature of the phase transitions where the number of fermi surfaces changes from zero to one , such as the phase transition between a pure boson and a mixed phase .",
    "this is done in the same spirit to the expansion for small boson density conducted at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : mixdi ] that has allowed us to establish that the transitions between pure fermion and any phase with a finite density of bosons can only be first order .",
    "the starting point is the mean - field hamiltonian derived in eq .  , with the difference that now , to simplify the analysis , we will assume that the fermion dispersion appearing in eq .",
    "is quadratic , @xmath213 , where @xmath214 if fermions , like bosons , move strictly in 1d , whereas @xmath215 if we instead consider the mixed - dimensional case where fermions are free to move in all three dimensions , while bosons still move strictly in 1d .",
    "note that assuming a quadratic isotropic dispersion for the fermions is expected to be a good approximation in the small fermion density regime that we are going to consider here , even if the true dispersion in the mixed - dimensional case is anisotropic : in fact , when fermions start to mix with bosons , they must necessarily occupy the lowest band energy levels , for which the dispersion can be approximated as quadratic .",
    "the anisotropy can be rescaled out when evaluating the fermion density @xmath216 as a function of the fermi wavevector @xmath217 , and yields to an overall prefactor relative to the isotropic result .",
    "considering the mean - field hamiltonian derived in eq .",
    ", the following step is to average over the fermion operator density in the fermion hamiltonian  , obtaining the fermi - dirac distribution function at zero temperature , @xmath218 .",
    "the free energy density we obtain this way will have a different dependence on the fermi density depending whether fermions move in 1d or 3d .",
    "let us start considering the case where fermions move in 1d , so that the lineal fermi density defined in eq .",
    "is @xmath219 and the free energy potential @xmath220 reads as : @xmath221 note that now the free energy potential @xmath222 depends on both the boson and fermion densities as well as on the chemical potentials .",
    "this means that minimizing @xmath223 with respect to the fermion density , @xmath224 we retrieve the free energy potential @xmath88 considered in eq .  , which global minimum with respect to the boson density gives the true thermodynamic grand - canonical free energy density  .",
    "however , if we instead minimize @xmath225 with respect to the boson density , @xmath226 so that to eliminate @xmath227 in favor of @xmath177 , @xmath101 and @xmath100 , then the free energy potential @xmath228 thus obtained can be used to study the phase transitions where the number of fermi surfaces changes from zero to one , by expanding for small values of @xmath177 . because the dimensionless function @xmath83 coming from the bethe ansatz is determined numerically ,",
    "this plan of deriving the free energy potential @xmath229 is not a trivial one .",

    "this is the result of fermionization in the tonks - girardeau limit  @xcite .    evaluating   by solving @xmath235 for @xmath236 , in both cases of high and low boson density , we obtain a series in terms of the fermi density of cubic form : @xmath237 for high boson density the coefficients , for @xmath238 , which requires @xmath100 and @xmath103 to have the same sign , are given by @xmath239 in the low boson density limit , instead , we obtain ( also for @xmath240 ) that the coefficients of the expansion   are now given by @xmath241 in this last case , note that , for @xmath242 , as we have assumed in the main text , the coefficient of the cubic term is expected to be positive and large . in both cases , while @xmath243 , the coefficient of the square term is always negative , @xmath244 , implying that the transition can not be continuous , rather it is first order . for small fermion density , the transition has place for @xmath245 and @xmath246 , implying that , for large values of the coefficient @xmath247 , @xmath248 and the transition is weakly first order , as we have indeed observed numerically in many cases .",
    "the @xmath177 expansion just carried on thus allows us to understand the nature of the transition between the pure bose gas and mixed phases and deduce that it has to be first order in the strictly 1d limit .",
    "we can merge this result with the one obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : mixdi ] , where we were expanding for small boson density ( tonks - girardeau limit ) , and found that the transition between the pure fermi gas and the mixed phases is also first order .",
    "we can thus conclude that in the 1d limit the transitions between the pure boson / fermion phases and the mixed phase , must be all first order .    for comparison purposes",
    ", we can now consider the case of mixed dimensionality , i.e. , where fermions move in 3d .",

    "thus the kinetic energy contribution to the free energy potential @xmath251 now scales differently than in the 1d limit : @xmath252 as before , we eliminate the boson density @xmath227 from the potential @xmath223 by making use of   and then we expand for small values of the fermi density @xmath177 . in this case",
    "we obtain : @xmath253 where the coefficient @xmath254 is given by the expressions   for the high boson density , while by   for the low boson density limit .",
    "the coefficient @xmath255 is in both cases instead given by : @xmath256 we can thus see that , while the coefficient @xmath254 can change sign depending on the values of the system parameters , the coefficient of the next order term , which scales like @xmath257 rather than quadratically , is always positive @xmath258 .",
    "this means that the position of the closest minimum to @xmath259 is entirely controlled by the sign of @xmath254 , that is , the transition between the pure boson and mixed phases must be continuous .",
    "by contrast , as we have argued in sec .",
    "[ sec : mixdi ] , the transition between the pure fermion and the mixed phase is independent on the dimensionality where fermions live and is always first order .",
    "the main conclusion of the simple exercise carried on in this appendix is that the different nature of the phase transitions where the number of fermi surfaces changes from zero to one between the strictly 1d case and the mixed - dimensional case is a consequence of the different scaling of the fermion kinetic energy in 1d and in 3d .",
    "note that this result is also applicable to the transitions between the pure fermion and mixed phases , as bosons in 1d at low density behave as a free fermi gas by virtue of fermionization ."
