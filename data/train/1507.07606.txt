    "over the last two decades , there has been an intense interest in nonlinear matter waves in the context of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite . in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) setting ,",
    "arguably , one of the most prototypical excitations that arise are vortex rings ( vrs ) .",
    "such toroidal - shaped vortices , or rings of vorticity , have been predicted theoretically and observed experimentally in numerous studies ; see , e.g. , the relevant reviews  @xcite .",
    "in addition to their relevance in superfluids , vrs are of intense interest in other areas , e.g. , in fluid mechanics  @xcite .",
    "superfluid vrs have been observed experimentally in helium @xcite , far before their emergence in atomic becs of dilute alkali gases . in the atomic bec setting , these states have arisen in a variety of ways .",
    "one such example is through the bending of a 3d vortex line ( i.e. , a line of vorticity ) so that it closes on itself  @xcite .",
    "vortex rings have also been experimentally realized through the decay of planar dark solitons in two - component becs  @xcite , by density engineering  @xcite ( related to earlier theoretical proposals of refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and in the evolution of colliding symmetric defects  @xcite .",
    "they have also been detected through their unusual collisional outcomes of structures that may appear as dark solitons in cigar - shaped traps  @xcite .",
    "numerical studies have also theoretically explored potential methods to generate vrs .",
    "some of these examples involve the flow past an obstacle  @xcite , bloch oscillations in an optical trap  @xcite , the collapse of bubbles  @xcite , the instability of two - dimensional ( 2d ) rarefaction pulses  @xcite , the flow past a positive ion  @xcite or an electron bubble  @xcite , the crow instability of two vortex pairs  @xcite and the collisions of multiple becs  @xcite .",
    "vr cores have an intrinsic velocity  @xcite ( a feature that can be understood by considering their cross - section resemblance to a vortex dipole which is well - known to travel at a constant speed  @xcite ) .",
    "however , this intrinsic velocity can be counterbalanced by the presence of an external trap , which is commonplace in atomic becs  @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , creates the possibility for the existence of stationary vrs , and , in fact , even of multi - rings , as discussed earlier , e.g. , in ref .",
    "the aim of the present work is to revisit the study of vrs , but from a different perspective to the above works , namely we focus of their bifurcation and emergence in the weakly nonlinear limit . in this sense",
    ", our study is partially connected to the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a somewhat similar approach was adopted . nevertheless , their work focused on a setting where the trapping was only in two out of three spatial directions ; another fundamental difference with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite is their absence of stability information in the relevant setup . on the other hand ,",
    "our study is also inspired by the pioneering work of ref .",
    "@xcite , which , in turn , motivated the experimental results of ref .  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spectrum of a dark soliton was examined ( although not in its full detail , as we will discuss below ) and some of the key instability mechanisms associated with it were elucidated .",
    "we are also motivated by the analysis presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , which used a somewhat similar approach to that used herein to explore bifurcations from a two - dimensional dark soliton to vortex - dipoles and , more generally , multi - vortex structures .",
    "our fundamental starting point will be the realization that a vr emerges from a suitable combination of two distinct states with a relative phase ( of @xmath0 between them ) , namely a planar dark soliton ( say , along the @xmath1-direction ) and of a ring dark soliton ( rds ) along the @xmath2 plane , another state studied extensively in earlier work ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "should the planar dark soliton have a lower energy than the rds , then the bifurcation happens from the former ; if the order of energies is reversed , then the bifurcation occurs from the rds . if , however , the energies are equal ( which , as we will see , happens for anisotropic traps , i.e. , when the trapping frequencies along the @xmath1- and radial @xmath3- directions satisfy @xmath4 ) , the vr state already emerges at the linear ( noninteracting ) limit .",
    "the presence of two principal modes in the coherent structure enables us to adapt a galerkin - type , two - mode methodology , originally developed for double - well potentials ; see , e.g. , relevant details in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the fundamental earlier work of ref .",
    "this two - mode approach allows us to provide a quantitative estimate , which turns out to not only qualitatively but also quantitatively predict the bifurcation / emergence point of the single vr .",
    "we use a similar approach to generalize to more complex states such as the double vr ( arising due to the combination of a double - soliton / second excited state along the @xmath1-axis , with a rds along the @xmath2 plane ) , and we further extend this approach to single and double vortex lines . since the planar dark soliton may spawn the vr , in the appropriate regime , we expand upon the work of ref .  @xcite by capturing all its modes using the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) analysis near the linear ( small - interaction ) limit .",
    "this limit enables a perturbative treatment of the relevant modes , both in the isotropic and in the anisotropic case , clearly allowing us to identify neutral modes , modes responsible for instabilities and also the bifurcations of novel states such as the vr , and the single and double solitonic vortex .",
    "we provide , both , analytical estimates and full - numerical calculations for the relevant eigenvalues , and provide connections with the analytical two mode theory discussed above .",
    "once the relevant bifurcations arise , especially those leading to the single and double vrs of focal interest herein , we turn our attention to their spectra to quantify instability and the potential stabilization mechanisms .",
    "this leads us to conclude that these states tend to be weakly unstable in the small - interaction limit , but may in principle be stabilized in the large - interaction setting .",
    "it is relevant to mention that this problem remains of particular interest , not only for theoretical but also for recent experimental studies .",
    "a notable example is the very recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the tomographic imaging of a superfluid fermi gas of @xmath5li atoms enabled the observation of the snaking instability of the planar dark soliton into a vr ( and subsequently into a vortex line ) .",
    "connecting state - of - the - art observations such as these to the understanding of stationary - state stability offered here should furnish a complete picture of the underlying complex dynamics of the system .",
    "our presentation is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : analytical ] contains the different aspects of our analytical results ; first , the bifurcation analysis ( of single and double vrs ) using the galerkin method ; and second , the spectral analysis , for the small - interaction limit , of the dark solitons which we connect to the above bifurcation structure . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , we provide detailed numerical computations of the existence and stability of dark solitons , and subsequently vrs and multi - vrs , starting from the small - interaction limit .",
    "we provide comparisons between our numerical and analytical predictions . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] , we summarize our findings and present both , our conclusions , as well as some interesting directions for future studies .",
    "in this work we utilize the 3d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , expressed in the following dimensionless form  @xcite : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the macroscopic wavefunction of the 3d bec near zero temperature , while the potential assumes the prototypical parabolic form , namely : @xmath8 the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the trapping strengths along the @xmath2 plane and @xmath1 direction , respectively , with the spherically symmetric ( isotropic ) case corresponding to @xmath11 .      in the linear limit ,",
    "( [ gpe ] ) reduces to the quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) , with energy spectrum : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the non - negative integers indexing the corresponding eigestate .",
    "let us now discuss how to construct a vr starting from the considered linear limit .",
    "intriguingly , utilizing the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , this is possible in the following way : in that work it was found that for the anisotropic trap with @xmath16 and @xmath17 the energy of a second radial excited state ( @xmath14,@xmath13,@xmath18 ) with @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( i.e.  @xmath21 ) coincides with that of the @xmath15-th excited state along the @xmath1-axis @xmath22 ( also equal to @xmath23 ) . for such anisotropic traps",
    "one can construct stationary states with @xmath15-parallel - vrs @xmath24 _ even at the linear limit_. the rds nature of the real part combined with the @xmath15 oscillations of the imaginary part along the @xmath1-direction constitutes parallel vrs with alternating vorticity .",
    "remarkably , this is a very natural 3d generalization of the 2d setting considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the above expression of eq .",
    "( [ vr ] ) , we have used the notation @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] corresponding to the eigenmode of energy @xmath26 of the qho where @xmath27 represents the hermite polynomials .",
    "generalizing the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite by considering anisotropic trap strengths @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( including the isotropic one of @xmath11 ) , the energies of the rds and the @xmath15-th solitonic state will , respectively be , @xmath28 hence , for @xmath29 , the state of lower energy will be the @xmath15-th soliton from which the @xmath15-th vr will bifurcate , while for @xmath30 , the lower energy will belong to the rds , with the bifurcation occurring from that state .      following the bifurcation phenomenology of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we first consider the limit @xmath32 which encompasses the isotropic trap , and proceed as follows .",
    "take the @xmath15-th soliton along the @xmath1-axis , focusing for now on @xmath33 , and assign this as mode @xmath34 with energy @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , assign the rds as mode @xmath36 with energy @xmath37 .",
    "if a novel state ( in this case , the single vr ) bifurcates from these two states when their phase difference is @xmath0 , then a general two - mode analysis  @xcite predicts that the number of atoms @xmath38 at the bifurcation critical point will be given by @xmath39 where for the above special case of the single vr we have @xmath40 , while @xmath41 and @xmath42 are overlap integrals .",
    "specifically , for the vr , the dark soliton state from which the bifurcation arises is @xmath43 , while the rds is @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , the general two - mode theory also predicts the chemical potential value at which the bifurcation will occur , namely @xmath45 where @xmath46 is given by eq .",
    "( [ predict ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the above integrals can be computed analytically .",
    "in particular , for the case of the single vr with @xmath33 , we find that @xmath47 as a result , the explicit prediction for the bifurcation of the vr is that : @xmath48 this provides us with an explicit prediction for the bifurcation of the first vr .      for completeness",
    ", we now consider the case of @xmath50 , where the vr now bifurcates from the rds and the subscripts of eq .",
    "( [ predict ] ) must be exchanged 1@xmath512 . for this case , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which leads to the bifurcation point : @xmath54 the superscripts in eqs .",
    "( [ pred1 ] ) and ( [ pred2 ] ) versus those of eqs .",
    "( [ pred1a ] ) and ( [ pred2a ] ) are used to illustrate which state the vr bifurcates from , 1 is for the dark soliton and 2 represents the rds .      similarly , for the double - vortex - ring ( 2vr )",
    "state @xmath56 , while the overlap integrals are given by @xmath57 hence , the corresponding prediction for the bifurcation point yields @xmath58 these predictions are valid for @xmath59 . in this case , the 2vr will bifurcate from the two - dark - soliton state of the form @xmath60 , while the higher energy state in the two - mode analysis will again be the rds .      on the other hand , for @xmath62 the prediction needs to be suitably modified . since the 2vr now bifurcates from the rds we again exchange the subscripts in eq .",
    "( [ predict ] ) . using @xmath63 ( for @xmath64 )",
    "we finally find that : @xmath65    an interesting feature is the following .",
    "for @xmath32 , the single vr bifurcates from the one - dark soliton ( @xmath33 ) and for @xmath55 the 2vr bifurcates from the two - dark - soliton state ( @xmath66 ) . in the `` intermediate '' case , @xmath67 , the 2vr state bifurcates from the rds , while the single vr bifurcates from the one - dark soliton . finally ,",
    "for @xmath68 , both the single vr and the 2vr states bifurcate from the rds . hence ,",
    "as expected , @xmath69 , i.e.  first the lower - energy single vr bifurcates , followed by the 2vr state .",
    "we remark in passing that , in line with the special - case results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the single vr bifurcates from the linear limit ( @xmath70 ) in the anisotropic case of @xmath4 , as per eq .",
    "( [ pred1 ] ) , while the 2vr bifurcates from the linear limit , precisely for the isotropic case of @xmath71 , as per eq .",
    "( [ pred3 ] ) .",
    "one can similarly generalize these types of bifurcation considerations for all higher - order rings , providing an explicit set of predictions for their emergence in the vicinity of the linear limit .",
    "this bifurcation and stability analysis naturally explains why the decay of dark solitonic states yields the corresponding @xmath15-vr states , not only in numerical simulations  @xcite , but also in experiments  @xcite .      while the emphasis here is on vrs , partly to illustrate that the different states obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite can be identified with the techniques presented herein , we also provide other special cases , namely the single- and double - solitonic vortex states .",
    "for the case @xmath55 , following the same technique as above but with @xmath72 , we obtain : @xmath73 for the single solitonic vortex ( bifurcating from the dark soliton @xmath74 ) . for the double solitonic vortex ,",
    "again bifurcating from @xmath74 but with @xmath75 , one finds the bifurcation point : @xmath76 for @xmath32 .",
    "the reverse trap anisotropies can similarly be explored .",
    "finally , and before proceeding with the stability analyses of the dark soliton and the resulting vr states that are the principal focus of the present work , let us compare our work to ref .",
    "our existence results bear significant resemblance to those of ref .",
    "@xcite , although there are also nontrivial differences . for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the focus was on bifurcations from the dark soliton ( called the kink therein ) state , whereas we especially focus on bifurcations from various states that yield vr - like solutions ( single and double vrs ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath1-direction is presumed to be homogeneous ( i.e. , untrapped ) , while here we consider the presence of a trap . for this reason ,",
    "multi - vr states ( such as those explored above ) are _ not _ possible in the framework of ref .",
    "in fact , the 2vr state in that work is one in which both rings are in the same plane , while here we explore multiple _ non - coplanar _ rings in a stationary state , rendered possible by the additional trapping along the @xmath1-direction . on a technical level too , the methodology of the reduction to a quasi - linear equation on the plane with an effective potential used in ref .",
    "@xcite , while ingenious , differs substantially from the two - mode approach utilized herein .",
    "finally , and perhaps most importantly , a principal focus that stems from our existence findings is that , we also study the stability of the obtained solutions ( see details in the following section ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , this is deferred to future studies .",
    "we now move to the stability analysis in the vicinity of the linear limit . using a taylor expansion of the solution @xmath77 and @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) , where @xmath79 correspond , respectively , to the eigenvalue and eigenfunction of a state at the linear limit , we find at o@xmath80 the solvability condition : @xmath81 this , in turn , allows us to specify @xmath82 ( to leading order ) .",
    "then , the spectral stability , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , amounts to solving the bdg eigenvalue problem @xmath83 , with @xmath84 where @xmath85 , while @xmath86 where the star denotes complex conjugate . here",
    ", we denote @xmath87 as the eigenfrequency of a given eigenstate @xmath88 with eigenvalue @xmath89 .",
    "the presence of a nonzero imaginary part of @xmath87 or , equivalently , of a nonzero real part of @xmath90 in our hamiltonian system denotes the presence of a dynamical instability .      from the above formulation",
    ", it is straightforward to analyze the stability in the case of @xmath91 .",
    "there , it is evident that the linearization spectrum consists of the diagonal contributions of @xmath92 which consist of the spectrum of @xmath93 and of its opposite . up to now",
    ", we have kept our exposition as general as possible , but from here on , we will focus on a specific state in order to showcase the relevant ideas more concretely . as our workhorse",
    ", we will use the dark soliton state @xmath94 , in a spirit similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , but with a particular view towards the bifurcation of the vr state ( as well as others such as the 2vr and the single and double solitonic vortex ) .",
    "since @xmath93 consists of the quantum harmonic oscillator , the spectrum for a dark soliton along the @xmath1-axis , when subtracting @xmath95 , will be ( see eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) ) @xmath96    recalling that @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are arbitrary non - negative integers , we now proceed to explore the relevant states and their multiplicities . the mode with @xmath97 corresponds to the _ negative energy _",
    "@xcite , or negative krein signature  @xcite , mode .",
    "such a mode , when resonant with another positive energy ( or krein signature ) one , will give rise to complex eigenvalue quartets , while collisions of modes of the same energy will be inconsequential towards changing the stability properties of the solution . the dark soliton state",
    "( with vanishing density in the @xmath98 plane ) has a neutral mode , corresponding to @xmath99 , which has a wavefunction identical to the solution itself .",
    "this mode corresponds to the phase or gauge ( u@xmath100 ) invariance of eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) .",
    "there are three additional kohn modes corresponding to symmetry which are also left invariant .",
    "specifically , @xmath101 corresponds to dipolar oscillations along the @xmath1-axis with frequency @xmath102 , while the modes @xmath103 and @xmath104 pertain to dipolar oscillations along the @xmath2-plane with frequency @xmath105 . to complete our discussion of modes with @xmath106",
    ", we need to account for five more modes .",
    "there are two degenerate modes ( due to the radial invariance of the trap in the plane ) of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , with frequency @xmath109 and three degenerate ones , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , all of which have frequency @xmath113 in the linear limit .",
    "the key question that subsequently arises is that of the fate of the eigenvalues described above , as @xmath114 becomes finite , i.e. , as we depart from the linear limit . to follow these eigenvalues , and given that the different degeneracies also hinge on the specific values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we will use as our benchmark case the isotropic scenario of @xmath115 , where the choice of unity is made without loss of generality . in this case",
    ", the zero eigenvalue has a multiplicity of three .",
    "the gauge - invariance mode must remain at zero , and so too must the two modes ( 1,0,0 ) and ( 0,1,0 ) due to the spherical invariance of the dark soliton solution , but only when the trap is isotropic .",
    "we now move to the consideration of the principal @xmath116 modes ( recall that this is really 7 pairs ) at @xmath117 . out of these",
    ", the 3 dipolar modes will remain invariant . then , however , 4 modes are subject to deviations , as soon as we depart from the linear limit .",
    "it turns out that the insightful work of ref .",
    "@xcite has already computed one sub - manifold associated with such a bifurcation . in that work",
    ", the authors recognized that the eigenvector associated with the rds @xmath118 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : uv ] ) ] and the anomalous mode @xmath119 become _ resonant _ , and identified the deviations by using degenerate perturbation theory , i.e. , constructing the matrix @xmath120 with @xmath121 and identifying its eigenvalues for @xmath122 for the above eigenvectors .",
    "that calculation , adapted to the present setting , can be rewritten as @xmath123 ( cf .",
    "( 20 ) in ref .",
    "it is important to note that the near - linear prediction is that the dark soliton should be _ immediately unstable _ due to this resonant interaction , via an oscillatory instability and a quartet of corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "this is a general feature that dark soliton ( and multi - soliton ) states possess near the linear limit due to the degeneracy of their anomalous modes ; cf .  the work of ref .",
    "however , in that work these instability `` bubbles '' were shown to terminate at some finite value of @xmath124 , hence it is of interest to explore whether a similar feature arises here , a question that we will address below numerically .",
    "on the other hand , in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , an additional ( and , as we will see , important ) sub - manifold of eigenvectors was not considered , namely that of @xmath125 and of @xmath126 . for this subspace , we find that the corresponding deviation of the eigenfrequency from the linear limit again , obtained via the degenerate perturbation theory of eq .",
    "( [ degen]) yields : @xmath127    given the decreasing trend of both of these eigenvalues , it is natural to expect that at some finite value of @xmath124 , they will hit the origin of the spectral plane . as a preamble to our numerical computations of the next section ,",
    "it is then relevant to consider what the outcome of such a collision will be .",
    "connecting these findings with our bifurcation theory results of the previous subsection , we appreciate that these collisions should be , in fact , what leads to the corresponding bifurcations and destabilizations of the dark soliton along the @xmath98 plane .",
    "in particular , the mode @xmath118 effectively corresponds to the rds .",
    "its `` collision '' with the origin and subsequent destabilization of the dark soliton along the @xmath98 plane suggests that beyond this threshold the planar dark soliton and rds mesh , which , as we have discussed before , produces the single vr state . in the same spirit",
    ", we can see that the collision of @xmath125 with the origin will produce a meshing with the planar dark soliton and lead to the bifurcation of the two solitonic vortex state , discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "in fact , assuming the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ eig2 ] ) to be useful beyond its realm of validity ( and until @xmath128 ) yields a critical point for the relevant bifurcation at @xmath129 , which coincides with the prediction of @xmath130 of eq .",
    "( [ pred8 ] ) .",
    "we will numerically examine the validity of these predictions in the next section .      in principle ,",
    "the approach adopted above ( and the associated eigenvalue count and deviations from the linear limit ) can be used for any state bifurcating from the linear limit . however",
    ", obviously , the more complicated the original state , the more difficult it becomes to account for all the relevant eigenvalues .",
    "since our focus here is on vrs and their emergence , we will also give an additional example of the case of @xmath132 ( more generally bearing in mind the case of @xmath133 ) , which will be considered in our numerical eigenvalue analysis below .",

    "@xcite appears to arise , namely the resonant interaction of the rds mode and of the anomalous mode ceases .",

    "we note , however , that as we proceed to larger values of the chemical potential , the instability appears to ( weakly ) decrease and , hence , vrs may again be long - lived in the thomas - fermi limit of large @xmath124 . additionally , it is worthwhile to note that once again the collision of @xmath118 with the anomalous mode @xmath119 leads to a resonance and an oscillatory instability for the interval @xmath182 .",

    "an additional collision of a mode bifurcating from the origin with the anomalous mode @xmath119 leads to an additional eigenfrequency quartet for @xmath191 .",
    "a key observation here is that these instabilities ( both the imaginary one and the oscillatory one for @xmath191 ) were found to persist throughout the interval of parameters considered herein . however , for large values of @xmath124 , we observe a weak tendency for both of these instabilities towards decreasing growth rates .",
    "the latter feature appears to be qualitatively consonant with the observations of ref .",
    "@xcite , suggesting that , for intermediate parameters , 2vr states were less robust than for large values of the corresponding nonlinearity - controlling parameter .",
    "once again , the theme of the thomas - fermi limit will be the subject of separate work , focusing on the dynamics and interactions of vrs as particle entities .",
    "in conclusion , we have systematically examined the full eigenvalue spectrum by linearization around a dark soliton in a 3d setting , building on considerable earlier work , most notably that of ref .",
    "@xcite . extending that work ,",
    "we have shown how to predict not only the formation and bifurcation of the ( single ) vortex ring state , but also of other states , such as the double - vortex - ring , the single- and the double - solitonic vortices , among others . we have explained how the emergence of these states can be predicted on the basis of a galerkin - type , two - mode , approach .",
    "this is analogous to how a vortex pair , and more complex states involving multiple vortices , were predicted to arise in 2d ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , a step that subsequently led to their experimental realization  @xcite .",
    "we have explored the conditions necessary for the vortex ring to emerge through a bifurcation from the planar dark soliton state , and explained when it can arise from the linear limit ( when the energy of the ring dark soliton and that of the dark soliton coincide ) .",
    "conversely , the vortex ring may arise through a bifurcation from the ring dark soliton , when the latter possesses lower energy than the planar dark soliton state .",
    "we have also highlighted similarities and differences from important related work such as the contribution of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to giving a qualitative characterization of the relevant spectra and bifurcations , in the vicinity of the linear limit , we also employed perturbation theory ( often in its more complex degenerate form ) in order to quantitatively characterize the eigenvalues responsible for the relevant instabilities and the emergence of new branches .",
    "upon obtaining a systematic understanding of when the vortex rings arise , we turned our attention to their spectral stability properties , by numerically solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equations .",
    "we thus found that at the isotropic limit , the single vortex ring may be unstable `` at birth '' , but can be stabilized at higher chemical potentials . in the anisotropic case , where the vortex ring state emerges from the linear limit , it is also immediately unstable but this instability can be relatively weak in different parametric regimes , such as that of large chemical potential .",
    "similar features were found for the double vortex ring , in qualitative agreement with earlier dynamical observations  @xcite .",
    "we believe that this study paves the way for a deeper understanding of such vortex ring states , offering an unprecedented view of their spectral features . in this light , there are numerous aspects worthy of further exploration .",
    "a more technical example involves the attempt to systematically characterize the spectrum of multiple vortex rings in the special cases where they emerge in the linear limit , i.e. , at @xmath192 for the @xmath15-th vortex ring state .",
    "a more intriguing aspect for our considerations is to explore the opposite limit more systematically , namely the thomas - fermi realm , where the single and multiple vortex rings possess particle characteristics .",
    "while in this area there is some work already done , it is rather incomplete .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a theoretical approximation of the vortex ring internal mode spectrum was obtained at this `` particle limit '' , but it was never tested against the full bogoliubov - de gennes spectrum or the three - dimensional gpe . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a particle picture is derived and favorably compared to the gpe results , but this is only done in the absence of a trap . obtaining a conclusive spectral picture for single and multi - vortex rings in the presence of a trap would certainly be of paramount importance for our understanding of the particle - like character of these complex states and of their interactions within trapped becs .",
    "finally , once these aspects are addressed , one can think of not only examining the role of thermal and/or quantum fluctuations on these rings , but also importantly of generalizing them in multi - component systems , where elaborate spinorial states exist in the form of skyrmions  @xcite and monopoles  @xcite , among many others .",
