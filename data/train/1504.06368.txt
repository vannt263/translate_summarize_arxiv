    "electronic structure calculations have played an important role in understanding the properties of a wide range of materials systems  @xcite . in particular , the kohn - sham formalism of density functional theory  @xcite has been the workhorse of ground - state electronic structure calculations .",
    "however , the kohn - sham approach requires the computation of single - electron wavefunctions to compute the kinetic energy of non - interacting electrons , whose computational complexity typically scales as @xmath1 for an @xmath2-electron system , thus , limiting standard calculations to materials systems containing few hundreds of atoms .",
    "while there has been progress in developing close to linear - scaling algorithms for the kohn - sham approach  @xcite , these are still limited to a few thousands of atoms , especially for metallic systems  @xcite .",
    "the orbital - free approach to dft  @xcite , on the other hand , models the kinetic energy of non - interacting electrons as an explicit functional of the electron density , thus circumventing the computationally intensive step of computing the single - electron wavefunctions .",
    "further , the computational complexity of orbital - free dft scales linearly with the system size as the ground - state dft problem reduces to a minimization problem in a single field  the electron density .",
    "the past two decades has seen considerable progress in the development of accurate models for orbital - free kinetic energy functionals  @xcite , and , in particular , for systems whose electronic - structure is close to a free electron gas ( for e.g. al , mg ) .",
    "also , orbital - free dft calculations are being increasingly used in the simulations of warm dense matter where the electronic structure is close to that of a free electron gas at very high temperatures  @xcite . as the reduced computational complexity of orbital - free dft enables consideration of larger computational domains ,",
    "recent studies have also focused on studying extended defects in al and mg , and have provided important insights into the energetics of these defects  @xcite .",
    "the widely used numerical implementation of orbital - free dft is based on a fourier space formalism using a plane - wave discretization  @xcite .",
    "a fourier space formulation provides an efficient computation of the extended interactions arising in orbital - free dft ",
    "electrostatics and kinetic energy functionals  through fourier transforms .",
    "further , the plane - wave basis is a complete basis and provides variational convergence in ground - state energy with exponential convergence rates .",
    "however , the fourier space formulations are restricted to periodic geometries and boundary conditions that are suitable for perfect bulk materials , but not for materials systems containing extended defects .",
    "also , the extended spatial nature of the plane - wave basis affects the parallel scalability of the numerical implementation and is also not suitable for multi - scale methods that rely on coarse - graining . in order to address the aforementioned limitations of fourier space techniques",
    ", recent efforts have focussed on developing real - space formulations for orbital - free dft and numerical implementations based on finite - element  @xcite and finite difference discretizations  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we build on these prior efforts to develop an efficient real - space formulation of orbital - free dft employing the widely used non - local wang - govind - carter ( wgc )  @xcite kinetic energy functional . as in prior efforts  @xcite",
    ", we reformulate the extended interactions in electrostatics and the non - local terms in the wgc kinetic energy functionals as local variational problems in auxiliary potential fields . however , the proposed reformulation of electrostatic interactions is notably different from previous works , and enables the evaluation of variational configurational forces corresponding to both internal atomic relaxations as well as external cell relaxation under a single framework .",
    "further , the proposed formulation naturally extends to all - electron orbital - free dft calculations of warm dense matter  @xcite . in the proposed real - space formulation ,",
    "the ground - state orbital - free dft problem is reformulated as an equivalent saddle point problem of a local functional in electron density , electrostatic potential and the auxiliary potential fields ( kernel potentials ) accounting for the extended interactions in the kinetic energy functional .",
    "we employ a higher - order finite - element basis to discretize the formulation , and demonstrate the optimal numerical convergence of both the ground - state energy and configurational forces with respect to the discretization .",
    "further , we propose an efficient numerical approach to compute the saddle point problem in electron density , electrostatic potential and kernel potentials by expressing the saddle point problem as a fixed point iteration problem , and using a self - consistent field approach to solve the fixed point iteration problem .",
    "we subsequently investigate the accuracy and transferability of the proposed real - space formulation of orbital - free dft for al and mg materials systems .",
    "to this end , we compute the bulk properties of al , mg and al - mg intermetallics , and compare it with kohn - sham dft . as orbital - free dft only admits local pseudopotentials , the kohn - sham dft calculations are conducted using both local and non - local psedupotentials .",
    "our studies indicates that the bulk properties computed using orbital - free dft for al , mg and al - mg intermetallics are in good agreement with kohn - sham dft .",
    "we further investigate the accuracy of orbital - free dft by computing the interatomic forces in al and mg , which are also in good agreement with kohn - sham dft calculations .",
    "our studies demonstrate that orbital - free dft is accurate and transferable across a wide range of properties for al , mg and al - mg intermetallics , and can be used to study properties of these materials systems that require computational domains that are not accessible using kohn - sham dft .",
    "for instance , in the present study we computed the formation energy of @xmath3 al - mg alloy containing @xmath4 atoms in a unit cell employing the proposed real - space formulation of orbital - free dft , but the same system was found to be prohibitively expensive using kohn - sham dft .",
    "we finally investigate the cell - size effects in the electronic structure of point defects , in particular a mono - vacancy in al .",
    "prior studies using fourier - based formulations of orbital - free dft have suggested that the formation energy of a mono - vacancy in al is well converged by 108 - 256 atom cell - sizes  @xcite .",
    "however , coarse - grained real - space calculations have suggested that much larger cell - sizes of the order of 1,000 atoms are required for convergence of vacancy formation energies  @xcite , which was also supported by asymptotic estimates  @xcite . in order to understand the underpinnings of this discrepancy",
    ", we use the finite - element discretized real - space formulation of orbital - free dft and compute the vacancy formation energy using two boundary conditions : ( i ) periodic boundary conditions , equivalent to fourier - space based formulations ; ( ii ) bulk dirichlet boundary conditions , where the perturbations in the electronic structure arising due to the vacancy vanishes on the boundary of the computational domain .",
    "our study suggests that while the vacancy formation energy is well converged by 108 atom cell - size using periodic boundary conditions , the electronic fields are not well - converged by this cell - size . on the other hand",
    "the bulk dirichlet boundary conditions show well converged formation energy as well as electronic fields by cell sizes of @xmath51,000 atoms , which is consistent with prior real - space calculations .",
    "this study reveals that while periodic boundary conditions show a superior convergence in formation energies due to the variational nature of the formalism , the true cell - size effects which also measure convergence of electronic fields are provided by the bulk dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "we note that the proposed real - space formulation with finite - element discretization are crucial to employing bulk dirichlet boundary conditions , which enable the study of isolated defects in bulk .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii provides a description of the orbital - free dft problem .",
    "section iii presents the proposed real - space formulation of the orbital - free dft problem , the configurational forces associated with structural relaxations , and the finite - element discretization of the formulation .",
    "section iv discusses the numerical implementation of the formulation and presents an efficient numerical approach for the solution of the saddle point real - space variational problem .",
    "section v presents the numerical convergence results of the finite - element discretization of the real - space formulation , the accuracy and transferability of the real - space orbital - free dft formalism for al - mg materials system , and the study of the role of boundary conditions on the cell - size effects in electronic structure calculations of point defects .",
    "we finally conclude with a summary and outlook in section vi .",
    "the ground - state energy of a charge neutral materials system containing @xmath6 nuclei and @xmath2 valence electrons in density functional theory is given by  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the electron - density and @xmath9 denotes the vector containing the positions of @xmath6 nuclei . in the above",
    ", @xmath10 denotes the kinetic energy of non - interacting electrons , @xmath11 is the exchange - correlation energy , @xmath12 is the hartree energy or classical electrostatic interaction energy between electrons , @xmath13 is the classical electrostatic interaction energy between electrons and nuclei , and @xmath14 denotes the electrostatic repulsion energy between nuclei .",
    "we now discuss the various contributions to the ground - state energy , beginning with the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy , denoted by @xmath11 , incorporates all the quantum - mechanical interactions in the ground - state energy of a materials system .",
    "while the existence of a universal exchange - correlation energy as a functional of electron - density has been established by hohenberg , kohn and sham  @xcite , its exact functional form has been elusive to date , and various models have been proposed over the past decades . for solid - state calculations , the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite and the generalized gradient approximation  @xcite have been widely adopted across a range of materials systems . in particular , the lda exchange - correlation energy , which is adopted in the present work , has the following functional form : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in the present work ,",
    "we use the ceperley and alder constants  @xcite in equation  .",
    "the last three terms in equation   represent electrostatic interactions between electrons and nuclei .",
    "the hartree energy , or the electrostatic interaction energy between electrons , is given by @xmath20 the interaction energy between electrons and nuclei , in the case of local pseudopotentials that are adopted in the present work , is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the pseudopotential corresponding to the @xmath23 nucleus , which , beyond a core radius is the coulomb potential corresponding to the effective nuclear charge on the @xmath23 nucleus . the nuclear repulsive energy is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the effective nuclear charge on the @xmath26 nucleus .",
    "the above expression assumes that the core radius of the pseudopotential is smaller than internuclear distances , which is often the case in most solid - state materials systems .",
    "we note that in a non - periodic setting , representing a finite atomic system , all the integrals in equations  - are over @xmath27 and the summations in equations  - include all the atoms . in the case of an infinite periodic crystal ,",
    "all the integrals over @xmath28 in equations  - are over the unit cell whereas the integrals over @xmath29 are over @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , in equations  - , the summation over @xmath30 is on the atoms in the unit cell , and the summation over @xmath31 extends over all lattice sites .",
    "henceforth , we will adopt these notions for the domain of integration and summation .",
    "the remainder of the contribution to the ground - state energy is the kinetic energy of non - interacting electrons , denoted by @xmath10 , which is computed exactly in the kohn - sham formalism by computing the single - electron wavefunctions ( eigenfunctions ) in the mean - field  @xcite .",
    "the conventional solution of the kohn - sham eigenvalue problem , which entails the computation of the lowest @xmath2 eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the kohn - sham hamiltonian , scales as @xmath32 that becomes prohibitively expensive for materials systems containing a few thousand atoms . while efforts have been focused towards reducing the computational complexity of the kohn - sham eigenvalue problem  @xcite , this remains a significant challenge especially in the case of metallic systems . in order to avoid the computational complexity of solving for the wavefunctions to compute @xmath10 , the orbital - free approach to dft models the kinetic energy of non - interacting electrons as an explicit functional of electron density  @xcite .",
    "these models are based on theoretically known properties of @xmath33 for a uniform electron gas , perturbations of uniform electron gas , and the linear response of uniform electron gas  @xcite . as the orbital - free models for the kinetic energy functional are based on properties of uniform electron gas , their validity is often limited to materials systems",
    "whose electronic structure is close to a free electron gas , in particular , the alkali and alkali earth metals .",
    "further , as the orbital - free approach describes the ground - state energy as an explicit functional of electron - density , it limits the pseudopotentials calculations to local pseudopotentials . while these restrictions constrain the applicability of the orbital - free approach , numerical investigations  @xcite",
    "indicate that recently developed orbital - free kinetic energy functionals and local pseudopotentials can provide good accuracy for al and mg , which comprise of technologically important materials systems .",
    "further , there are ongoing efforts in developing orbital - free kinetic energy models for covalently bonded systems and transition metals  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we restrict our focus to the wang - goving - carter ( wgc ) density - dependent orbital - free kinetic energy functional  @xcite , which is a widely used kinetic energy functional for ground - state calculations of materials systems with an electronic structure close to a free electron gas .",
    "in particular , the functional form of the wgc orbital - free kinetic energy functional is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 in equation  , the first term denotes the thomas - fermi energy with @xmath36 , and the second term denotes the von - weizs@xmath37cker correction  @xcite .",
    "the last term denotes the density dependent kernel energy , @xmath38 , where the kernel @xmath39 is chosen such that the linear response of a uniform electron gas is given by the lindhard response  @xcite . in the wgc functional  @xcite ,",
    "the parameters are chosen to be @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "for materials systems whose electronic structure is close to a free - electron gas , the taylor expansion of the density dependent kernel about a reference electron density ( @xmath42 ) , often considered to be the average electron density of the bulk crystal , is employed and is given by    @xmath43    in the above equation , @xmath44 and the density independent kernels resulting from the taylor expansion are given by @xmath45 numerical investigations have suggested that the taylor expansion to second order provides a good approximation of the density dependent kernel for materials systems with electronic structure close to a free electron gas  @xcite . in particular , in the second order taylor expansion , the contribution from @xmath46 has been found to dominate contributions from @xmath47 .",
    "thus , in practical implementations , often , only contributions from @xmath46 in the second order terms are retained for computational efficiency .",
    "in this section , we present the local variational real - space reformulation of orbital - free dft , the configurational forces associated with internal ionic relaxations and cell relaxation , and the finite - element discretization of the formulation .      [",
    "sec : rs - formulation ] we recall that the various components of the ground - state energy of a materials system ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : ofdft ] ) are local in real - space , except the electrostatic interaction energy and the kernel energy component of the wgc orbital - free kinetic energy functional that are extended in real - space .",
    "conventionally , these extended interactions are computed in fourier space to take advantage of the efficient evaluation of convolution integrals using fourier transforms . for this reason ,",
    "fourier space formulations have been the most popular and widely used in orbital - free dft calculations  @xcite . however , fourier space formulations employing the plane - wave basis result in some significant limitations .",
    "foremost of these is the severe restriction of periodic geometries and boundary conditions .",
    "while this is not a limitation in the study of bulk properties of materials , this is a significant limitation in the study of defects in materials .",
    "for instance , the geometry of a single isolated dislocation in bulk is not compatible with periodic geometries , and , thus , prior electronic structure studies have mostly been limited to artificial dipole and quadrapole arrangements of dislocations .",
    "further , numerical implementations of fourier - space formulations also suffer from limited scalability on parallel computing platforms .",
    "moreover , the plane - wave discretization employed in a fourier space formulation provides a uniform spatial resolution , which is not suitable for the development of coarse - graining techniques  such as the quasi - continuum method  @xcite  that rely on an adaptive spatial resolution of the basis .",
    "we now propose a real - space formulation that is devoid of the aforementioned limitations of a fourier space formulation .",
    "the proposed approach , in spirit , follows along similar lines as recent efforts  @xcite , but the proposed formulation differs importantly in the way the extended electrostatic interactions are treated . in particular , the proposed formulation provides a unified framework to compute the configurational forces associated with both internal ionic and cell relaxations discussed in  [ sec : configurationalforces ] .",
    "we begin by considering the electrostatic interactions that are extended in the real - space .",

    "we note that , while the above reformulation of electrostatic interactions has been developed for pseudopotential calculations , this can also be extended to all - electron calculations in a straightforward manner by using @xmath82 and @xmath25 to be the total nuclear charge in the above expressions .",
    "thus , this local reformulation provides a unified framework for both pseudopotential as well as all - electron dft calculations .",

    "<S> we propose a local real - space formulation for orbital - free dft with density dependent kinetic energy functionals and a unified variational framework for computing the configurational forces associated with geometry optimization of both internal atomic positions as well as the cell geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed real - space formulation , which involves a reformulation of the extended interactions in electrostatic and kinetic energy functionals as local variational problems in auxiliary potential fields , also readily extends to all - electron orbital - free dft calculations that are employed in warm dense matter calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we use the local real - space formulation in conjunction with higher - order finite - element discretization to demonstrate the accuracy of orbital - free dft and the proposed formalism for the al - mg materials system , where we obtain good agreement with kohn - sham dft calculations on a wide range of properties and benchmark calculations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate the cell - size effects in the electronic structure of point defects , in particular a mono - vacancy in al . </S>",
    "<S> we unambiguously demonstrate that the cell - size effects observed from vacancy formation energies computed using periodic boundary conditions underestimate the extent of the electronic structure perturbations created by the defect . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the bulk dirichlet boundary conditions , accessible only through the proposed real - space formulation , which correspond to an isolated defect embedded in the bulk , show cell - size effects in the defect formation energy that are commensurate with the perturbations in the electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> our studies suggest that even for a simple defect like a vacancy in al , we require cell - sizes of @xmath0 atoms for convergence in the electronic structure . </S>"
