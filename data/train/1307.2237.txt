    "provide an intuitive framework for this phenomenon in which the gravity - dependence of cloud particle size and cloud base pressure conspire to produce similar column optical depths in cool , low - gravity photospheres and slightly warmer , high - gravity conditions .",
    "this results in spectral types that appear earlier than expected based on evolutionary model - predicted temperatures and spectral type - temperature relations for field objects .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of an l - type companion to the young m3.5v star 2mass  j012250932439505 at a projected separation of 1.45@xmath0 ( @xmath152  au ) as part of our adaptive optics imaging search for extrasolar giant planets around young low - mass stars . </S>",
    "<S> 2mass  01222439  b has very red near - infrared colors similar to the hr 8799 planets and the reddest known young / dusty l dwarfs in the field . </S>",
    "<S> moderate - resolution ( @xmath2@xmath13800 ) 1.52.4  @xmath3 m spectroscopy reveals a near - infrared spectral type of l4l6 and an angular @xmath4-band shape , confirming its cool temperature and young age . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of 2mass  01222439  ab are marginally consistent with members of the @xmath5120  myr ab  dor young moving group based on the photometric distance to the primary ( 36  @xmath6  4  pc ) and our radial velocity measurement of 2mass  01222439  a from keck / hires . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the ab  dor group age for the system , but the high energy emission , lack of @xmath76707 absorption , and spectral shape of 2mass  01222439  b suggest a range of @xmath510120  myr is possible . </S>",
    "<S> the age and luminosity of 2mass  01222439  b fall in a strip where `` hot - start '' evolutionary model mass tracks overlap as a result of deuterium burning . </S>",
    "<S> several known substellar companions also fall in this region ( 2mass  j01035515  abb , ab  pic  b , @xmath8  and  b , g196 - 3  b , sdss  2249 + 0044  b , lp  261 - 75  b , hd 203030 b , and hn peg b ) , but their dual - valued mass predictions have largely been unrecognized . </S>",
    "<S> the implied mass of 2mass  01222439  b is @xmath11213  or @xmath12227  if it is an ab  dor member , or possibly as low as 11  if the wider age range is adopted . </S>",
    "<S> evolutionary models predict an effective temperature for 2mass  01222439  b that corresponds to spectral types near the l / t transition ( @xmath113001500  k ) for field objects . however , we find a mid - l near - infrared spectral type , indicating that 2mass  01222439  b represents another case of photospheric dust being retained to cooler temperatures at low surface gravities , as seen in the spectra of young ( 830  myr ) planetary companions </S>",
    "<S> . altogether , the low mass , low temperature , and red colors of 2mass  01222439  b make it a bridge between warm planets like @xmath9  pic  b and cool , very dusty ones like hr  8799  bcde . </S>"
