    "the development of abilities of manipulating spins of itinerant and confined electrons is the central problem in modern spintronics @xcite .",
    "a variety of techniques , not based on the magnetic field effects , has been proposed for solving this problem in nonmagnetic semiconductors .",
    "the first set of approaches employes the low - frequency electric field applications .",
    "these approaches utilize spin - orbit coupling , which couples spin to momentum , and , it turn , to the low - frequency electric field which influences the electron motion .",
    "spin - orbit coupling here plays a role of a magnetic field acting on the electron spin and spin - splitting the electron states energies @xcite .",
    "the other set of techniques , described as the optical spintronics , is based on the indirect spin manipulation by light with the photon energies of the order of one or tenth of mev .",
    "the interest in the optical techniques is increasing because they do not require electrical contacts attached to the sample and can allow a very fast spin control .",
    "the simplest example is absorption of circularly polarized light in a iii - v semiconductor producing electron spin polarization @xcite .",
    "one of the central concepts in spin manipulation is the spin current , where electrons with opposite spins move in the opposite directions , leading to spin accumulation at different regions of the sample . a conventional way to produce a spin current",
    "is based on the spin - hall effect induced by a constant electric field , where the sign of the hall angle depends on the electron spin direction @xcite .",
    "a set of recent proposals for producing spin current , accompanied or not by a charge current , is based on the coherent control of the one - photon and two - photon processes and light absorption in quantum wells @xcite .",
    "almost all the present techniques for optical spin manipulation are based on light absorption , that is on an incoherent process .",
    "the only exception is the recently proposed stimulated raman scattering @xcite , which can be used without photon absorption , being in this since , a coherent process",
    ".    in atomic physics , spin - orbit and magnetic field effects can be introduced by the coherent manipulations without incoherent interlevel transitions @xcite . here",
    "we propose purely coherent way of spin manipulation and spin current production based on the force acting on a two - level system close to the resonance in a nonuniform optical field @xcite .",
    "these techniques are widely used in atomic physics to manipulate the atomic motion but have not been considered for spins of electrons in solids and spintronics applications . here",
    "we propose a tool to inject a spin current and spatially separate electrons with opposite spins by a technique applied in optics to filter atoms in the ground and excited states @xcite .",
    "we will show that by a similar technique one can produce a spin - dependent dipole force acting on electrons in two - dimensional semiconductor structures .",
    "to explain the physics of the spin separation , assume first that we have a general two - level system with the ground @xmath0 ( energy @xmath1 ) and excited @xmath2 ( energy @xmath3 ) states .",
    "the system interacts with electromagnetic radiation at the frequency @xmath4 close to the interlevel resonance at @xmath5 . in the rotating wave approximation",
    ", the hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the rabi frequency , which we assume here for simplicity to be real , @xmath7= @xmath8 , determined by the amplitude of oscillating external field @xmath9 @xmath10 is the transition dipole matrix element , and @xmath11 is the frequency shift with respect to the interlevel resonance .",
    "we assume that the broadening of the levels can be neglected compared to @xmath7 . in the case of relatively weak external field if @xmath12 the system is close to the ground state @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding energy shift of the ground state obtained from hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) : @xmath13 depends on the sign of @xmath14 .",
    "assume that the electric field is nonuniform , and , therefore , @xmath15 depends on the position of the two - level system . in this case , a dipole force @xcite @xmath16 acts on the system .",
    "the direction of the force : repulsion or attraction depends on the sign of @xmath17 that is on the shift of the radiation frequency with respect to the resonance .",
    "now we apply this approach to the spin - split electron states is quantum wells . as an example we consider the ( 110 ) gaas quantum well where the spin - orbit coupling hamiltonian has the form : @xmath18 } = \\alpha ^{\\left [ n\\right ] } k_{x}\\sigma _ { z } , \\label{hso}\\ ] ] and we use the usual convention for the system axes with respect to crystal axes as @xmath19,$ ] @xmath20,$ ] and @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the coupling constant @xcite depends on the size quantization subband @xmath22 as : @xmath23 } = -\\alpha _ { d}n^{2}\\left ( \\pi /w\\right ) ^{2}/2,$ ] where @xmath24 is the bulk dresselhaus constant , and @xmath25 is the quantum well width . therefore , the spin up @xmath26-spin down @xmath27 splitting @xmath28 } = 2|\\alpha^{\\left [ n\\right]}k_{x}|$ ] strongly depends on the subband number .",
    "the advantage of this well geometry is that the @xmath29component of the spin is conserved even if momentum changes , and , therefore , it relaxes very slowly .",
    "= 5.5 cm    we consider now a quantum well irradiated by infrared light in the @xmath30polarization mode at a nonzero incidence angle @xmath31 with the electric field vector located in the incidence plane . as a result , the poynting vector of the radiation has components both in the plane of the well and perpendicular to it . in this geometry nonzero @xmath32 in the well",
    "is produced at the assumed frequency @xmath33 exactly matching the intersubband resonance such that @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the electron effective mass .",
    "for simplicity we assume zero boundary conditions for the electron wavefunction . in this case",
    ", the transition between the spin up states is shifted with respect to the resonance by @xmath36}-\\alpha^{\\left[1\\right]}\\right)k_{x}=3\\alpha^{\\left [ 1\\right ] } k_{x},$ ] while the transition between spin - down states is shifted by @xmath37 } k_{x},$ ] as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 . taking into account that typical values of @xmath38 are of the order of 1 mev , and the intersubband distance",
    "@xmath39 is of the order of 100 mev , the required frequency stability of the radiation source should be better than 0.1 percent",
    ". the broadening of the spin levels in this case can be neglected , too .    according to eq.([potential ] ) , a spin - dependent dipole force is acting on the electron in the case of coordinate - dependent electric field , and , therefore , coordinate - dependent @xmath7 defined as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the corresponding eigenfucntions .",
    "this approach is implemented in the proposal for the atomic diode @xcite , where the field is produced by a laser beam close to the atomic resonance .",
    "to estimate the upper boundary of the potential and to understand whether it is possible to observe the spin separation experimentally , we begin with the estimate of electric field @xmath43 at which the rabi frequency @xmath7 is of the same order of magnitude as the so splitting @xmath44 } /\\hbar $ ] : @xmath45 } .$ ] with @xmath44 } \\sim 1 $ ] mev , @xmath46 nm , one obtains @xmath47 @xmath48 the corresponding absolute value of the poynting vector @xmath49 @xmath50 is not high and can be achieved experimentally .",
    "to demonstrate the spin separation effect , we consider a spin - unpolarized flow of electrons through a channel of a micron or submicron width @xcite extended along the @xmath51-axis and irradiated by an electromagnetic wave in the @xmath30mode .",
    "this field has a component perpendicular to the quantum well and , therefore , leads to a nonzero rabi frequency .",
    "we assume for simplicity that all electrons entering the channel have the same momentum @xmath52 and velocity @xmath53 along the @xmath51-axis .",
    "the electrons with almost parallel momenta can be injected from a two - dimensional electron gas through a tunneling barrier ( as shown in fig.2 ) or through a narrow collimator .",
    "the tunneling probability strongly depends on the component of momentum along the channel and , therefore , leads to the collimation of the outgoing electrons .",
    "we concentrate below at the electrons that can pass through the channel .",
    "the resulting optical spin - dependent potential @xmath54 and @xmath55component of the force @xmath56 , as follows from eqs.([potential ] ) and ( [ hso ] ) are : @xmath57}}\\sigma_{z},\\text{\\qquad}f_{\\sigma } ( x , y)=-% \\frac{\\partial u_{\\sigma } ( x , y)}{\\partial y},\\ ] ] where for brevity we use @xmath58 instead of @xmath59 .",
    "we consider only the @xmath60-component of the force since it leads to a qualitative effect : spin current across the channel and spin accumulation at its boundaries .",
    "the @xmath51-component of the force , @xmath61 is nonzero , too .",
    "however , it only slightly accelerates electrons along the channel , and , despite a spin - dependence , does not have a qualitative effect on the spin density .",
    "the coordinate dependence of the rabi frequency is given by the field distribution at the quantum well surface @xmath62 , \\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the spot dimensions of the order of light wavelength of tens of microns .",
    "the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath65 depend on the shape of the infrared beam and its incidence angle .",
    "our following analysis does not depend on the details of the field distribution provided it is inhomogeneous both in the @xmath51 and @xmath60-directions . in addition , we assume that the channel boundaries , even if modify the irradiating field distribution , do not distort its shape strongly .",
    "the microchannel is shifted at the distance @xmath66 of the order of @xmath64 from the spot center to assure a nonvanishing dipole force .",
    "we also assume that the channel width @xmath67 is much smaller than @xmath68 and @xmath69 such that the available @xmath60 are limited by : @xmath70 the resulting optical potential can be estimated as @xmath71 mev .",
    "the corresponding force @xmath72}\\lambda_{y}\\right ) \\sigma_{z}$ ] leads to the spatial transverse separation in the velocities and coordinates : spin - up ( spin - down ) electrons are accumulated at the upper ( lower ) boundary of the channel , as shown below .",
    "= 5.5 cm    in the irradiated area , the electrons with opposite spins are accelerated in the opposite directions , producing spin - hall effect in a coherent optical potential .",
    "a nonzero spin current @xmath73 for @xmath74 spin component propagating in the @xmath55direction : @xmath75 appears , where @xmath76 is the spin - projected density , and @xmath77 is the corresponding velocity component with @xmath78 . we assume that in the geometry shown in fig.2 , all electrons reaching the channel boundaries , are absorbed there .",
    "the spin up electrons are accumulated near the upper side of the channel , electrons with spin down - at the lower side of it . as a result , a spin density pattern is formed .",
    "we consider electrons moving through the irradiated channel , where the force @xmath79 is approximately uniform across it and only the linear terms can be taken into account . in this case",
    "the acquired velocity and displacement for electrons , which have not yet reached the boundaries are given by : @xmath80 the first equality in eq.([vysigma ] ) is exact and does not depend on the details of the incident field distribution .",
    "solutions of equations ( [ vysigma ] ) and ( [ ysigma ] ) have the asymptotic behavior : @xmath81 and @xmath82 the resulting spin accumulation near the boundaries has the form : @xmath83 as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , and @xmath22 is the total concentration of electrons in the channel in the steady state . if neither of the spatial conditions in eqs.([n : minus ] ) , ( [",
    "n : plus ] ) is satisfied , then @xmath84 , and the total spin density is zero .",
    "the transverse spin - dependent velocity change @xmath85 can be estimated as @xmath86},$ ] where @xmath87 is the irradiated channel part passing time , and does not depend strongly on the spot size . corresponding spin - dependent transverse separation of electrons passed through the channel @xmath88 can be estimated as : @xmath89 with @xmath90 @xmath91m@xmath92 cm , @xmath93 we obtain @xmath94 @xmath91 m as an upper estimate of the displacement .",
    "the resulting spin deviation angle of the order of @xmath95 is an order of magnitude larger than the spin - hall angle due to the spin - dependent scattering by charged impurities @xcite in the diffusive regime . in the ballistic regime , the hamiltonian in eq.([hso ] ) does no lead to a transverse spin separation even if a static external electric field is applied along the channel .",
    "therefore , in the absence of external radiation , spin - hall effect in the system we consider , will vanish .    in the above consideration we assumed ballistic motion of the electrons through the channel .",
    "this assumption is justified by the fact that at mobility @xmath96 @xmath97/vs achieved in high quality samples and electron velocity @xmath98 cm / s , the free path for gaas is close to 35 micron , much larger than the spot size .",
    "we have shown that electron spins in low - dimensional semiconductor structures can be manipulated coherently by coordinate - dependent optical fields at infrared frequencies , producing optical form of spin - hall effect for electrons .",
    "the resulting spin - dependent forces are similar to the atomic state - dependent dipole forces in nonuniform optical fields used to manipulate motion of cold atoms .",
    "the separation of ballistically moving electrons with opposite spins , vanishing in the absence of external radiation , can be of the order of few tenth of a micron , that is much larger than can be expected for the spin - hall effect due to the scattering by the charged impurities in the diffusive regime .",
    "our model can be naturally extended to more general spin - orbit coupling hamiltonians , including the rashba term @xcite .",
