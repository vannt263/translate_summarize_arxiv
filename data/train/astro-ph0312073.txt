    "the availability for the first time of huge astronomical spectroscopic surveys such as the sdss , with more than @xmath0 spectra , will allow the determination of intrinsic physical parameters of a large number of galaxies , including the age distribution or star formation history and metallicity distribution of their stellar populations .",
    "the importance of the accurate knowledge of these parameters for cosmological studies and for the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution can not be overestimated .",
    "template fitting has been used to carry out estimates of the distribution of age and metallicity from spectral data .",
    "although this technique achieves good results , it is very expensive in terms of computing time and therefore can be applied only to small samples .",
    "starting from a grid of theoretical population synthesis models we constructed a set of model galaxies with a distribution of ages , metallicities and intrinsic reddening . using this set",
    "we have explored a new method that maximizes speed and accuracy .",
    "our proposed technique combines standard least - squares fitting with an active instance - based machine learning algorithm .",
    "experimental results show that this method can estimate with high speed and accuracy the physical parameters of the stellar populations . based on empirical evidence",
    "we believe that this method can be applied with equal success to other astronomical problems , reducing the computational cost and thus providing the capability of analyzing larger quantities of astronomical data .",
    "for the spectral synthesis of simple stellar populations the atmospheric models have been folded with the predicted number of stars along isochrones of given age and metal content ( bressan et al .",
    "the atmosphere models have been inserted in low resolution kurucz models ( kurucz 1993 ) in order to preserve the complete energy distribution .",
    "the models have the following characteristics :    * ages are from @xmath1 to @xmath2 in logarithmic steps : * metallicity has the values z=[0.0004 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 , 0.05 ] in solar units * the resolution is smoothed at the desired value .    for the present experiments we used solar metallicity ( 0.02 ) and a resolution of 20  .",
    "given an observed galaxy spectrum we would like to determine the relative distribution of ages and their intrinsic reddening .",
    "we restricted the problem to finding three contribution of ages : starbursts of age 1myr , an intermediate age population with age between 100myr and 1000myr and an old population with age greater than 1000myr .",
    "each of the three populations is affected by the same reddening law which is defined as follows : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the free parameter of each stellar population and @xmath5 is the wavelength , in this case going from 890 to 2.301 @xmath6 m . in order to determine the free parameters of reddening and the relative contributions we pose the problem as an optimization problem , where a modified version of a machine learning algorithm is trained to estimate the reddening parameters of the three populations",
    "once we have an estimate of the reddening we can compute the relative contribution of ages , @xmath7 , with a pseudo inverse matrix as follows : let @xmath8 $ ] be the grid of our nine theoretical models described earlier .",
    "@xmath9 is the observed spectrum , and @xmath10 is the vector of the free reddening parameters predicted by the learning algorithm for @xmath9",
    ". we can compute @xmath11 $ ] , by applying to the theoretical models the reddening function as defined in equation  [ redspectra ] .",
    "@xmath12 we know that the observed spectrum @xmath9 is the product of @xmath13 and the unknown relative contributions @xmath7 , @xmath14 @xmath15 then by computing @xmath16 , the pseudo - inverse of @xmath13 , we can determine the relative contribution of ages , as equation [ abund ] shows .",
    "the following section introduces the optimization procedure used in this work .",
    "we are interested in the problem of finding the parameters of a known analytic function that best match an observation .",
    "let @xmath9 be the observed galactic spectrum variable , let @xmath17 be a function with the same dimensionality as @xmath18 .",
    "the goal of the optimization procedure is to obtain the value of @xmath17 that minimizes the error @xmath19 . in order to solve the problem more efficiently ,",
    "we pose it as a learning problem , where a learning algorithm learns the reddening parameters , and with a forward model we compute @xmath17 .",
    "the training set used by the algorithm , @xmath20 , is formed by randomly generated reddening parameters , @xmath21 , and their corresponding galactic spectra , , where contributions of ages were also generated randomly ; its test set consists of the galactic spectra to be analyzed denoted here by @xmath22 and it outputs an estimate of @xmath23 that is expected to minimize the errors @xmath24 . when a new set of solutions @xmath23 is proposed by the algorithm , we compute their corresponding @xmath25 , using equations [ redspectra],[testspec ] and [ abund ] , and use the new pairs @xmath26 to augment the training set , and continue this iterative process until convergence is attained .",
    "since this type of active learning adds to the training set examples that are progressively closer to the points of interest , the errors are guaranteed to decrease in every iteration .",
    "the pseudocode of the algorithm is the following :    1 .",
    "generate randomly an initial set of vectors @xmath27 and compute their corresponding @xmath28 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath29 be the initial training set .",
    "3 .   let @xmath30 be the test set .",
    "4 .   while @xmath31 is not empty 1 .",
    "train an approximator a using p as training set 2 .",
    "for each @xmath32 in @xmath31 * use a to predict @xmath33 * generate @xmath34 * @xmath35 * if @xmath36 remove @xmath37 from @xmath31    in this problem the approximator mentioned in step 4.1 is locally weighted linear regression , an instance - based learning algorithm that has shown good results in similar optimization problems ( fuentes & solorio 2003 ) .",
