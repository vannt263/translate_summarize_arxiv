    "in particular , binary mt is often parameterized , following a pre - calculated grid of more detailed models that were evolved in isolation .",
    "these models are based on a sophisticated treatment of stellar evolution , with some basic assumptions for the actual mt process ( e.g. energy conservation , mass conservation , etc . ) .",
    "the hydrodynamics involved in the mt process is traditionally not modeled directly within full star cluster simulations .",
    "moreover , even if the parameterizations are able to approximate the binary evolution accurately , perturbations during mt are rarely treated properly ( and are often ignored ) .",
    "for example , a direct encounter involving a binary undergoing mt could disrupt the binary or exchange a different star into the system , thus halting the mt process .",
    "scenarios such as these are not accounted for in many star cluster dynamical models .",
    "the assumption that mt occurs in relative isolation ( even in star clusters ) is often justified by comparing time - scales ; in many clusters the duration of mt , particularly for high - mass stars , can be quite short when compared to the single - binary ( 1 + 2 ) encounter time .",
    "however , for lower - mass stars , the typical duration of mt can greatly increase ( e.g. , due to the longer thermal and nuclear time - scales within the stars ) .",
    "furthermore , the binary - binary ( 2 + 2 ) encounter time - scale can be much shorter than the 1 + 2 encounter time in clusters with large binary frequencies .",

    "]    in this paper , we begin to quantify the validity of the assumption that mt can be treated as an isolated process within star clusters .",
    "due to mass segregation and dynamical friction , most binaries live in the dense cluster core , where they may not be allowed to evolve fully before being interrupted .",
    "we use the binary evolution code ` seba ` @xcite to simulate the time evolution of the binary orbital parameters of individual binaries undergoing stable mt , as described in section  [ method ] .",
    "we then compare the mt time - scales to analytic estimates for the time - scales over which other single and binary stars in the cluster are expected to encounter , or `` interrupt '' , the ongoing mt , as calculated in section  [ times ] .",
    "we show that the fraction of interrupted binaries can reach a few tens of percent , for certain cluster parameters .",

    "we present results from @xmath5 individual binary evolution simulations performed using the ` seba ` code . `",
    "seba ` is a fast stellar and binary evolution code , that parameterizes stars by their mass , radius , luminosity , core mass , etc . as functions of time and initial mass .",
    "the binary evolution includes mass loss , mt , angular momentum loss , common envelope evolution , magnetic braking and gravitational radiation . we consider only stable mt between hydrogen - rich non - degenerate stars .",
    "the stability of mt and the mt rate depend mainly on the adiabatic and thermal response of the donor star s radius , and the response of the roche lobe , to the re - arrangement of mass and angular momentum within the binary .",

    "we use the ` seba ` code to evolve these binaries for a hubble time and produce time - averaged orbital parameters ( i.e. , mean separation , mean binary mass ) calculated over the course of stable mt , as well as the cluster age at the onset of mt and the total duration of the mt phase , @xmath12 , for each binary .",
    "we use the output from ` seba ` to calculate the expected time - scales for another single or binary star in the cluster to ( directly ) encounter , or `` interrupt '' , each of the binaries while mt is ongoing , which we will call @xmath13 .",
    "we then compare this time - scale directly to the mt duration , @xmath12 , which is calculated and outputted by ` seba ` .    to calculate the encounter time - scale , @xmath13 , we must first find the time for a single ( @xmath14 ) or binary ( @xmath15 ) star to interrupt an ongoing episode of stable mt , which we will refer to as , respectively , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "as in , @xcite , we define these timescales as follows @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the star cluster central number density , @xmath20 is the central root - mean - square velocity ( and we assume @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 is the mean mass of a star in the cluster ( for which we adopt @xmath22 @xmath23 0.5  m@xmath1 ) , @xmath24 is the binary frequency , and @xmath25@xmath26 is the mean gravitationally - focused cross section , where @xmath27 is either the time - averaged separation of the binary undergoing stable mt ( for 1 + 2 encounters ) or the orbital separation corresponding to the cluster hard - soft boundary . ] ( for 2 + 2 encounters ) . finally , the total time until a subsequent encounter is given by , @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "to calculate the parameters in equation  [ eq : tau_enc1 ] , we consider total cluster masses @xmath30 ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath10  m@xmath1  in steps of 1 in @xmath32  [ m@xmath1 ]  @xmath34 , and assume a plummer model @xcite with a half - mass radius .",

    "see @xcite for specific details .",
    "in general @xmath19 increases with increasing cluster mass , while @xmath24 decreases with increasing cluster mass ( as is consistent with observations , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we find from these binary evolution simulations that , the probability that a given binary will be interrupted during mt in a star cluster core ranges from @xmath2 1% to well over unity .",
    "the main results are plotted in figures  [ fig : fig1 ]  and  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , both @xmath35 and @xmath36 are sensitive to the total cluster mass , whereas the mt durations @xmath12 are not .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath35 and @xmath36 to @xmath30 is due to the dependence of the semi - major axis at the hard - soft boundary on @xmath30 , which results ( on average ) in tighter binaries and lower binary fractions in more massive clusters . in low - mass clusters ,",
    "the mean binary separation and binary fraction are both large , causing @xmath36 to be short . as @xmath30 increases , both the mean binary separation and binary fraction decrease along with the separation at the hard - soft boundary , causing @xmath35 and @xmath36 to decrease and increase , respectively .",
    "importantly , most binaries undergoing stable mt have time - averaged separations that are on the order of only a few stellar radii , causing @xmath35 to exceed a hubble time nearly independent of @xmath30 . on the other hand , @xmath36 is always much shorter than a hubble time , due to the larger mean separation of the entire cluster binary population . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , a bimodality is apparent in the distribution for @xmath35 at low metallicity ( i.e. z @xmath23 0.0006 ) that is not apparent in either the @xmath35 distribution at high metallicity ( i.e. z @xmath23 0.02 ) or in either of the @xmath36 distributions .",
    "this is due to a bimodality that appears in the mean binary separation during mass transfer , which dominates the 1 + 2 cross - section but not the 2 + 2 cross - section , since the mean binary separation in the cluster is much larger than the mean binary separation during mass transfer .",
    "the first peak in this bimodal distribution ( at small orbital separations ) is due to systems for which stable mass transfer is initiated in a relatively tight binary , involving relatively unevolved stars .",
    "the second peak is due to systems with asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) donors that have lost so much mass that they are less massive than their companion .",
    "consequently , the resulting mass transfer is stable . for low metallicities ,",
    "this second group is bigger , and a second peak becomes clearly visible ( relative to high metallicities ) .",
    "this is because the lifetimes of low metallicity stars are shorter relative to more metal - rich stars .",
    "therefore , low mass stars are able to evolve off the main sequence , become an agb star , and hence fill their roche lobe all within a hubble time .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we compare @xmath12 and @xmath13 for each individual encounter directly , by calculating the cumulative poisson probability or the probability that a given binary will undergo at least one encounter with another star or binary within a time interval @xmath12 : @xmath37 equation  [ eqn : poisson ] approximates the probability that a given binary undergoes a _ direct _ encounter with another star or binary in the cluster before mt stops ( shown on the x - axis in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "importantly , fly - by encounters will also perturb binaries undergoing mt , and this is not accounted for in figures  [ fig : fig1 ] and  [ fig : fig2 ] . to quantify this effect , we ran simulations of 1 + 2 encounters using the ` fewbody ` code @xcite .",
    "we fix the binary orbital parameters and relative velocity at infinity for the encounters , but sample the impact parameter in multiples of 0.5@xmath38 , where @xmath38 is the impact parameter corresponding to a distance of closest approach equal to the binary semi - major axis @xmath39 , or @xcite : @xmath40 here , @xmath22 is the mean single star mass in the cluster and @xmath41 is the relative velocity at infinity .",
    "we perform @xmath42 numerical scattering experiments for every choice of the impact parameter .",
    "all stars are assumed to be point particles with masses of 1m@xmath1 .",
    "the initial binary semi - major axis and eccentricity are 1 au and 0 , respectively .",
    "the incoming velocity at infinity is set to @xmath43 km / s .",
    "the results of these scattering experiments are illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , which shows the mean ( absolute ) change in the binary semi - major axis and eccentricity for all simulations , as a function of the impact parameter .",
    "we assume here that a fly - by encounter `` interrupts '' a given binary undergoing mt if either of the two following criteria are met : 1 ) the change in semi - major axis @xmath44 is greater than or equal to the typical stellar radius at the onset of roche lobe overflow ( @xmath45 1 r@xmath1 for most binaries ) , and/or 2 ) the change in eccentricity @xmath46 corresponds to a change in the quantity @xmath47 that is greater than or equal to the typical stellar radius at the onset of mt , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the pericenter and apocenter distances , respectively , from the binary center of mass .",
    "we assume that the magnitude of such a perturbation is sufficiently large to at least temporarily halt the mt process ( provided @xmath50 and/or @xmath51 ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , the perturbative effects of fly - bys remain significant for b @xmath52 1.5@xmath38 .",
    "moreover , both @xmath53 and @xmath54 undergo a steep drop - off between b @xmath23 1@xmath38 and b @xmath23 2@xmath38 , such that neither of our criteria for a `` significant '' perturbation are satisfied for b @xmath55 1.5@xmath38 .",
    "our analytic estimates for the 1 + 2 and 2 + 2 encounter rates are directly proportional to the gravitationally - focused cross - section @xmath56 , for some impact parameter b. hence , if fly - bys are included , the time - scales for 1 + 2 and 2 + 2 encounters should each decrease by a factor @xmath57 , as should @xmath13 .",
    "working from equation  [ eqn : poisson ] , we find that the probabilities typically increase by a corresponding factor of @xmath45 2 .",
    "that is , the ratio between the probabilities calculated with and without this additional factor of @xmath45 2.1 in our estimate for @xmath13 peak at a value of @xmath45 2 with very little scatter .",
    "the fraction of binaries expected to be interrupted during mt can be estimated from the probability distributions presented in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "to do so , we integrate the probability distributions in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] and divide by the total number of binaries .",
    "the resulting fractions are @xmath58 0.18 , 0.10 , 0.03 and 0.01 for our model clusters with @xmath30[m@xmath1 ] @xmath23 10@xmath59 , 10@xmath60 , 10@xmath61 and 10@xmath62 , respectively , and a metallicity z @xmath23 0.02 .",
    "these fractions remain the same to within @xmath63% for a metallicity z @xmath23 0.0006 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] , the mean mass transfer duration is @xmath45 10@xmath64 years during the first 1 gyr of cluster evolution , then quickly increases by roughly an order of magnitude .",
    "after this , the mean mt duration slightly and slowly decreases over the next @xmath45 12 gyr , but remains much larger than during the initial 1 gyr .",
    "hence , if the initial 1 gyr of the cluster lifetime is excluded from our calculation for the fraction of binaries expected to be interrupted during mt , these estimates increase by a factor @xmath45 2 .",
    "13 gyr seen for the z @xmath23 0.0006 case should be regarded with caution .",
    "this is due in part to small number statistics , and the presence of a handful of binaries with unusually long mt durations at late times .",
    "this is not visible in the error bars , since we are showing the standard error of the mean here , and the number of binaries included in this calculation is large .",
    "perhaps more importantly , these error bars do not reflect any inherent uncertainties in the ` seba ` code and binary evolution in general , which are certainly non - negligible . ]",
    "these fractions correspond approximately to upper limits , since we adopt the mean orbital separation at the hard - soft boundary when calculating the 2 + 2 encounter time . if we adopt instead the mean orbital separation _ below _ the hard - soft boundary ( which does not include the presence of soft binaries ) , these fractions decrease by a factor of a few ( of the same order as the increase from including fly - bys ) . from these fractions",
    ", we can also estimate the number of binaries that are expected to be directly interrupted during ongoing stable mt : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the total number of initial binaries in the cluster ( estimated as @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 is the fraction of binaries expected to undergo mt ( calculated by ` seba ` for our assumed binary orbital parameter distributions ) and @xmath69 is the fraction of binaries undergoing mt that are expected to be interrupted over a hubble time of cluster evolution ( as calculated above for our four cluster masses ) .",

    "we find that a relatively large fraction @xmath69 of binaries undergoing stable mt may encounter another single or binary star in the core of a star cluster before the mt proceeds to completion .",
    "we calculate @xmath58 0.18 , 0.10 , 0.03 and 0.01 for our model clusters with @xmath30[m@xmath1 ] @xmath23 10@xmath59 , 10@xmath60 , 10@xmath61 and 10@xmath62 , respectively , nearly independent of metallicity .",
    "these fractions are only slightly lower than we calculated in @xcite for the fraction of interrupted stellar encounters in star clusters , which ranges from @xmath71 0.01 in massive gcs to @xmath72 0.4 in low - mass ocs .",
    "the origin of this analogous dependence between the fraction of interrupted `` events '' and the total cluster mass is ultimately the same ( see below ) .    as a binary undergoing",
    "mt generally has a relatively small geometric cross section , the interloper in these cases are most often binary stars themselves , resulting in 4-body encounters that may dramatically alter the course of the binary evolution .",
    "interrupted mt is expected to occur most often in massive ocs and low - mass gcs ( @xmath73  m@xmath1 ) , where in general the binary frequency is larger , and ( detached ) binaries can have larger orbital separations and therefore larger geometric cross sections .",
    "these larger binary frequencies and geometric cross sections present in the low - mass cluster regime also result in a larger fraction of interrupted stellar encounters .",
    "no publicly available code for star cluster dynamics accounts directly for the hydrodynamics of binary mt needed to accurately model such interrupted / perturbed mt binaries . as discussed in @xcite for interrupted stellar encounters ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath74 is encouraging for numerical models of star clusters , since low - mass clusters such as ocs are most often modeled with direct @xmath4-body simulations .",
    "direct @xmath4-body codes , such as ` nbody6 ` , can in principle apply perturbations to binaries undergoing ( parameterized ) mt , if the time steps are chosen appropriately . given our results , a more detailed study of",
    "how often such cases of interrupted mt occur and how accurately they are treated in direct @xmath4-body codes is warranted .",
    "massive clusters , on the other hand , are more often modeled with monte carlo codes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ", binary evolution is assumed to run to completion in isolation . in massive gcs",
    ", we find that this assumption is much more valid than in ocs ( albeit not perfect , see figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) , similar to what was found in @xcite for interrupted stellar encounters .",
    "the time - averaged separations of binaries undergoing stable mt are typically on the order of a few solar radii .",
    "however , stable and conservative mt leads to an increase in the binary orbital separation ( if the donor is less massive than the accretor ) . generally toward the end of the mt phase , after a mass - ratio inversion , the orbits expand significantly , increasing the binary cross - section and decreasing the 1 + 2 and 2 + 2 encounter times .",
    "hence , the time - scale for interruption decreases markedly at the end of the mt phase and beyond , which is not properly accounted for in our models ( since we only use the mean binary separation during mt ) .",
    "interestingly , the final separation is on the order of @xmath55 1 au in our models , which is comparable to the hard - soft boundary in old massive ( @xmath75  m@xmath1 ) gcs .",
    "hence , these binaries become subject to ionization due to dynamical encounters with other single and binary stars after mt . assuming a mt origin ,",
    "this could be of particular relevance for blue straggler formation in gcs .",
    "in particular , this naively predicts a rough correlation whereby the fraction of blue stragglers in binaries increases with decreasing @xmath30 .",
    "even the very intimate dance of binary mt can be interrupted by an interloping single or , more often , binary star in a star cluster . up to about a quarter of all binaries undergoing stable mt in the cores of massive ocs and low - mass gcs",

    "this fraction decreases towards @xmath76% for more massive gcs , primarily because the binary frequency in these clusters is much lower .",
    "cases of interrupted mt may lead to significantly different outcomes than are assumed for isolated evolution , which in turn may impact the formation rates of mt products in star clusters , from exotic stars like blue stragglers , to sn ia and gamma - ray burst progenitors .",
