    "the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) technique is a powerful way to estimate the ground state of a quantum mechanical system .",
    "the basic idea is that one can use the variational principle to minimize energy expectation value with respect to a set of parameters @xmath0 @xmath1 following the monte carlo method for evaluating integrals , one intreprets @xmath2 as a probability distribution function .",
    "typically , one assumes a functional form for the trial wave function , @xmath3 and the numerical advantage is that one can evaluate the energy integral by simply evaluating @xmath3 .",
    "the method becomes variational when one then adjusts the parameters to optimize the trial wave function .",
    "since the spectrum of @xmath4 is bounded from below , the optimized trial wave - function provides a best approximation to the true ground state of the system .",
    "however , since @xmath5 has a partner hamiltonian , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being the kinetic energy operator ) in which the spectrum of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are identical for all states above the ground state of @xmath8 .",
    "that is to say , the ground state of @xmath9 has the same energy as the first excited state of @xmath8 and so on .",
    "this hierarchy of related hamiltonians and the algebra associated with the susy operators present a powerful formal approach to determine the energy spectra for a wide number of systems .",
    "@xcite to date , little has been done exploiting susy as a way to develop new numerical techniques .    in this paper",
    ", we shall use the ideas of susy - qm to develop a monte carlo - like scheme for computing the tunneling splittings in a symmetric double - well potential .",
    "while the model can be solved solved using other techniques , this provides a useful proof of principle for our approach .",
    "we find that the the susy / vmc combination provides a useful and accurate way to obtain the tunneling splitting for this system and excited state wave function for this system .",
    "while our current focus is on a one - dimensional system , we conclude by commenting upon how the technique can be extended to multi - particle systems and to higher dimension . in short ,",
    "our results strongly suggest that this approach can be brought to bear on a more general class of problems involving multiple degrees of freedom .",
    "surprisingly , the connection between the monte carlo technique and the susy hierarchy has not been exploited until this paper .",
    "supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy - qm ) is obtained by factoring the schrdinger equation into the form @xcite @xmath10 using the operators @xmath11 since we can impose @xmath12 , we can immediately write that @xmath13 @xmath14 is the _ superpotential _ which is related to the physical potential by a riccati equation . @xmath15 the susy factorization of the schrdinger can always be applied in one - dimension .    from this point on we label the original hamiltonian operator and its associated potential , states , and energies as @xmath8 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "one can also define a partner hamiltonian , @xmath19 with a corresponding potential @xmath20 all of this seems rather circular until one recognizes that @xmath16 and its partner potential , @xmath21 , give rise to a common set of energy eigenvalues .",
    "this principle result of susy can be seen by first considering an arbitrary stationary solution of @xmath8 , @xmath22 this implies that @xmath23 is an eigenstate of @xmath9 with energy @xmath18 since @xmath24 likewise , the schrdinger equation involving the partner potential @xmath25 implies that @xmath26 this ( along with @xmath27 ) allows one to conclude that the eigenenergies and eigenfunctions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are related in the following way : @xmath28 @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "denotes the @xmath31th state associated with the @xmath32th partner hamiltonian with similar notion for related quantities such as energies and superpotentials . ]",
    "thus , the _ ground state of @xmath9 has the same energy as the first excited state of @xmath8_. if this state @xmath33 is assumed to be node - less , then @xmath34 will have a single node .",
    "we can repeat this analysis and show that @xmath9 is partnered with another hamiltonian , @xmath35 whose ground state is isoenergetic with the first excited state of @xmath9 and thus isoenergetic with the second excited state of the original @xmath8 .",
    "this hierarchy of partners persists until all of the bound states of @xmath8 are exhausted .",
    "having defined the basic terms of susy quantum mechanics , let us presume that one can determine an accurate approximation to the ground state density @xmath36 of hamiltonian @xmath8 .",
    "one can then use this to determine the superpotential using the riccati transform @xmath37 and the partner potential @xmath38 certainly , our ability to compute the energy of the ground state of the partner potential @xmath21 depends on having first obtained an accurate estimate of the ground - state density associated with the original @xmath16 .",
    "for this we turn to an adaptive variational monte carlo approach developed by maddox and bittner.@xcite here , we assume we can write the trial density as a sum over @xmath39 gaussian approximate functions @xmath40 parameterized by their amplitude , center , and width .",
    "@xmath41 this trial density then is used to compute the energy @xmath42 = tr[\\rho_{t}e(x ) ] = \\langle v_{1}\\rangle + \\langle q[\\rho_{t}]\\rangle \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 $ ] is the bohm quantum potential , @xmath44 = -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho_{t}}}\\nabla^{2}\\sqrt{\\rho_{t}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the energy average is computed by sampling @xmath45 over a set of trial points @xmath46 and then moving the trial points along the conjugate gradient of @xmath47(x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after each conjugate gradient step , a new set of @xmath48 coefficients are determined according to an expectation maximization criteria such that the new trial density provides the best @xmath39-gaussian approximation to the actual probability distribution function sampled by the new set of trial points .",
    "the procedure is repeated until @xmath49 . in doing so",
    ", we simultaneously minimize the energy and optimize the trial function . since the ground state is assumed to be node - less",
    ", we will not encounter the singularities and numerical instabilities associated with other bohmian equations of motion based approaches .",
    "@xcite moreover , the approach has been extended to very high - dimensions and to finite temperature by derrickson and bittner in their studies of the structure and thermodynamics of rare gas clusters with up to 130 atoms . @xcite",
    "as a non - trivial test case , consider the tunneling of a particle between two minima of a symmetric double potential well .",
    "one can estimate the tunneling splitting using semi - classical techniques by assuming that the ground and excited states are given by the approximate form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the lowest energy state in the right - hand well in the limit the wells are infinitely far apart . if we assume the localized states @xmath52 to be gaussian , then @xmath53 and we can write the superpotential as @xmath54 from this , one can easily determine both the original potential and the partner potential as @xmath55 while the @xmath16 potential has the characteristic double minima giving rise to a tunneling doublet , the susy partner potential @xmath21 has a central dimple which in the limit of @xmath56 becomes a @xmath57-function which produces an unpaired and node - less ground state . @xcite using eq .",
    "[ chargeop ] , one obtains @xmath58 which now has a single node at @xmath59 .    for a computational example",
    ", we take the double well potential to be of the form @xmath60 with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 which ( for @xmath64 ) gives rise to exactly two states at below the barrier separating the two minima with a tunneling splitting of 59.32 @xmath65 as computed using a discrete variable representation ( dvr ) approach.@xcite for the calculations reported here , we used @xmath66 sample points and @xmath67 gaussians and in the expansion of @xmath45 to converge the ground state .",
    "this converged the ground state to @xmath68 in terms of the energy .",
    "this , in itself is encouraging since the accuracy of typical monte carlo evaluation would be @xmath69 in terms of the energy .",
    "plots of @xmath16 and the converged ground state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the partner potential @xmath70 , can be constructed once we know the superpotential , @xmath14 . here",
    ", we require an accurate evaluation of the ground state density and its first two log - derivatives .",
    "the advantage of our computational scheme is that one can evaluate these analytically for a given set of coefficients . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a we show the partner potential derived from the ground - state density .",
    "where as the original @xmath16 potential exhibits the double well structure with minima near @xmath71 , the @xmath21 partner potential has a pronounced dip about @xmath72 .",
    "consequently , its ground - state should have a simple `` gaussian''-like form peaked about the origin .",
    "once we determined an accurate representation of the partner potential , it is now a trivial matter to re - introduce the partner potential into the optimization routes .",
    "the ground state converges easily and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a along with its gaussians . after 1000 cg steps , the converged energy is within 0.1% of the exact tunneling splitting for this model system .",
    "again , this is an order of magnitude better than the @xmath73 error associated with a simple monte carlo sampling .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig4]b shows @xmath74 computed using the converged @xmath75 density .",
    "as anticipated , it shows the proper symmetry and nodal position .    by symmetry ,",
    "one expects the node to lie precisely at the origin .",
    "however , since we have not imposed any symmetry restriction or bias on our numerical method , the position of the node provides a sensitive test of the convergence of the trial density for @xmath75 . in the example shown in fig.[fig3 ] , the location of the node oscillates about the origin and appears to converge exponentially with number of cg steps .",
    "this is remarkably good considering that this is ultimately determined by the quality of the 3rd and 4th derivatives of @xmath76 since these appear when computing the conjugate gradient of @xmath21 .",
    "we have tested this approach on a number of other one - dimensional bound - state problems with similar success .",
    "having demonstrated that the susy approach can be used to compute excitation energies and wave functions starting from a monte carlo approach , the immediate next step is to extend this to arbitrarily higher dimensions . to move beyond one dimensional susy , ioffe and",
    "coworkers have explored the use of higher - order charge operators @xcite , and kravchenko has explored the use of clifford algebras@xcite . unfortunately , this is difficult to do in general . the reason being that the riccati factorization of the one - dimensional schrdinger equation does not extend easily to higher dimensions .",
    "one remedy is write the charge operators as vectors @xmath77 and with @xmath78 as the adjoint charge operator .",
    "the original schrdinger operator is then constructed as an inner - product @xmath79 working through the vector product produces the schrdinger equation @xmath80 and a riccati equation of the form @xmath81 for a 2d harmonic oscillator , we would obtain a vector superpotential of the form @xmath82 let us look at the @xmath83 part closer : if we us the form that @xmath84 , then @xmath85 which for the 2d oscillator results in @xmath86 .",
    "thus , @xmath87 which agrees with the original symmetric harmonic potential .",
    "now , we write the scaled partner potential as @xmath88 this is equivalent to the original potential shifted by a constant amount .",
    "@xmath89 the ground state in this potential would be have the same energy as the states of the original potential with quantum numbers @xmath90 .",
    "consequently , even with the this nave factorization , one can in principle obtain excitation energies for higher dimensional systems , but there is no assurance that one can reproduce the entire spectrum of states .",
    "the problem is neither hamiltonian @xmath9 nor its associated potential @xmath91 is given correctly by the form implied by eq .",
    "[ 2dfactr ] and eq .",
    "rather , the correct approach is to write the @xmath9 hamiltonian as a _",
    "tensor _ by taking the outer product of the charges @xmath92 rather than as a scaler @xmath93 . at first",
    "this seems unwieldy and unlikely to lead anywhere since the wave function solutions in the second sector are now vectors rather than scalers .",
    "however , rather than adding an undue complexity to the problem , it actually simplifies matters considerably .",
    "as we demonstrate in a forthcoming paper , this tensor factorization preserves the susy algebraic structure and produces excitation energies for any dimensional susy system .",
    "moreover , this produces a scaler@xmath94 tensor @xmath94 scaler hierarchy as one moves to higher excitations.@xcite",
    "in brief , we have used the ideas of susy quantum mechanics to obtain excitation energies and excited state wavefunctions within the context of a monte carlo scheme .",
    "this was accomplished without pre - specifying the location of nodes or restriction to a specific symmetry . while it is clear that one could continue to determine the complete spectrum of @xmath8 , the real challenge is to extend this technique to higher dimensions .",
    "furthermore , the extension to multi - fermion systems may be accomplished through the use of the gaussian monte carlo method in which any quantum state can be expressed as a real probability distribution .",
    "@xcite we offer this paper as the starting point for stimulating interest in developing numerical techniques based upon susy quantum mechanics .",
