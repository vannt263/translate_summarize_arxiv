    "the galaxy m33 ( ngc  598 ) is one of the closest spiral galaxies of the local group .",
    "the measured distance to m33 ranges from 730  kpc ( christian & schommer  1987 ) to 910  kpc ( kim et al .",
    "2002 ) , with the most recent estimates of sarajedini et al .",

    "@xcite in the mid - range .",
    "the proximity of m33 , together with its large angular size ( optical size 53@xmath783 , holmberg 1958 ) , and its intermediate inclination ( @xmath8=53 ) , allows detailed studies of its stellar populations and ionized nebulae .",
    "m33 is a galaxy rich in both pne and  regions .",
    "the population of pne in m33 was early investigated using an objective - prism survey by ford  @xcite and lequeux et al .",
    "the advent of wide - field ccd cameras allowed deeper surveys .",
    "magrini et al .",
    "@xcite identified 131 candidate pne .",
    "more recently , ciardullo et al .",
    "@xcite confirmed a large number of previously detected pne and identified new candidates , leading to the current number of spectroscopically confirmed pne : 138 in the m33 disk and 2 in its halo .",
    "due the closeness of m33 and the brightness of the giant  regions , their spectroscopy was obtained since the 70s .",
    "searle @xcite presented spectrophotometry of eight  regions , and further spectroscopic studies were carried on by smith  @xcite , kwitter & aller  @xcite , and by vlchez et al .",
    "several catalogs of the m33  regions have been published , such as those by courtes et al .",
    "@xcite , calzetti et al .",
    "@xcite , wyder et al .",
    "@xcite , and hodge et al .",
    "recently , the local group census ( lgc , corradi & magrini  2006 ) and the local group survey ( lgs , massey et al .",
    "2007 ) have provided deep narrow- and broad - band @xmath92 square degree coverage of m33 , disclosing a conspicuous number of new emission - line objects located at all galactocentric distances .",
    "given the wealth of information on its pn and  region populations , m33 is indeed an ideal candidate to test chemical evolution predictions .",
    "the aim of the spectroscopic studies of pne and  regions is devoted both to the individual studies of these objects , and to draw the radial metallicity gradient across the disk .",
    "in particular , pne and  regions have two very different formation ages , and the comparison of these two populations provides insight on the evolution of the host galaxy .",
    "pn progenitors are low- and intermediate - mass stars ( lims ) , with masses between 1 and 8 m@xmath10 , which must have been formed between @xmath93@xmath11 yr and 10 gyr ago ( maraston 2005 ) .",
    "instead  regions are very young .    during their evolution , lims do not modify , at least at zeroth approximation , the composition of @xmath4- elements such as oxygen , neon , argon , and sulfur .",
    "these elements are produced mainly from the nucleosynthesis of type ii supernovae and maintain their capability to testify their original presence in the interstellar cloud that gave birth to the pn progenitor . while there are indications that for extremely low metallicities both oxygen and neon could be modified , as it has been observed both in the smc and in other dwarf galaxies ( leisy and dennefeld 2006 ; magrini et al .",
    "2005 ; kniazev et al .",
    "2008 ) , at the metallicity of m33 one does not expect any nucleosynthesis activity involving these elements ( marigo 2001 ) .    on the other hand , the helium , nitrogen , and carbon abundances measured in pne do not correspond to those at the time of the progenitor s formation , since these elements are synthesized in lims .",
    "these elements hence give information on lims evolution accordingly to their initial mass and metallicity , and , at given metallicity , are helpful to constrain the pn progenitor mass and age .",
    "the m33 metallicity gradient derived from @xmath4-element abundances has been the focus of several studies already , both involving pne and  regions .",
    "the advantage of m33 with respect to our galaxy , as a playground for gradients , is that pne in m33 have well determined galactocentric distances ( with relative errors within 5@xmath0 ) compared to the large indetermination of galactic pn distances ( stanghellini et al .",
    "magrini et al .",

    "the sample of 11 pne was too small for a definite answer to the pn gradient of m33 , especially given the paucity of pne observed at large galactocentric distances .",
    "the metallicity gradient of m33 using  regions has been obtained by many authors , with broadly different results .",
    "the first studies by smith  @xcite , kwitter & aller  @xcite , and vlchez et al .  @xcite agreed on a steep oxygen gradient .",
    "garnett et al .",

    "@xcite , magrini et al .",
    "@xcite , and rosolowsky et al .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter m07a and rs08 , respectively ) seem to converge to a much shallower gradient , respectively deriving @xmath12(o / h ) / @xmath12r = -0.012@xmath50.011 , -0.054@xmath50.011 , and -0.027@xmath50.012  dex  kpc@xmath6 .",

    "@xcite , based on ne / h and s / h , gives -0.058@xmath50.014 and -0.052@xmath50.021  dex  kpc@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the rs08 sample is the largest to date , and should be used preferentially , since the results from small samples might emphasize the scatter rather than the slope .",
    "metallicity gradients in m33 have also been estimated form young giant stars ( herrero et al .",

    "2006 ) .",
    "one of the most discussed questions about the metallicity gradient in disk galaxies is how it evolves with time .",
    "chemical evolution models ( see e.g. m07b for a review of m33 models ) predict different temporal behaviors of the metallicity gradient depending on assumptions such as gas inflow and outflow rate , and star and cloud formation efficiencies .",
    "observations are needed to constrain these theoretical scenarios , but so far they have been insufficient , especially for the old populations . comparing different sets of results for the young stellar populations , such as  regions , and",
    "the old population , such as agb and rgb stars , is also delicate , since the techniques of observing and analyzing nebulae and stars are very different , each with its own collection of uncertainties .",
    "the idea behind the observations leading to this paper is to study the chemical and physical properties of a large number of pne and regions using the same set of observations , the same data reduction and analysis techniques , and identical abundance determination methods , in order to avoid all biases due to the stellar vs. nebular analysis .",
    "the chemical properties of pne and  regions will provide us with snapshots at two epochs in the life - time of m33 , in particular of its metallicity gradient .",
    "in the present paper we show the results obtained from the pn data .",
    "we have obtained the first sizable sample of m33 pne with uniformly derived abundances in order to build the first sound gradient determination from pne . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will present our own  region results , and we will compare them with the pn results presented here .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in @xmath13  [ sect_obs ] we present the observations and data reduction , in @xmath13  [ sect_abu ] we discuss the plasma diagnostics used and how we determine the abundances of the pne , and in @xmath13  [ sect_pne ] we describe the pn properties . in @xmath13  [ sec_comp ] we compare the results with the pn populations in other galaxies .",

    "we obtained spectra of 102 pne and 48  regions in m33 using the mmt hectospec fiber - fed spectrograph ( fabricant et al .",
    "2005 ) which is equipped with an atmospheric dispersion corrector .",
    "the spectrograph was used with a single setup : 270 mm@xmath6 grating at a dispersion of 1.2   pixel@xmath6 .",
    "the resulting total spectral coverage ranged from approximately 3600   to 9100  , thus including the basic emission - lines necessary for the determination of their physical and chemical properties .",

    "we present spectroscopic observations of a large sample ( 102 ) of pne in the spiral galaxy m33 .",
    "the observations were secured with the spectrograph hectospec on the 6.5  m telescope mmt .    for 32 pne",
    "the electron temperature was directly computed .",
    "empirical relationships among electron temperatures and bright emission lines as  @xmath204686 , and  @xmath203727 were used to derive electron temperatures of the remaining pne .",
    "abundance diagnostic diagrams were built to study the pn population . from the plot of n / o versus he / h we found that the pne that fulfill the dopita  @xcite definition of type i pn are 19 .",
    "most pne are non type i , implying a population mainly composed by pne from old progenitors , with @xmath13m@xmath2 and ages @xmath30.3 gyr .",
    "a tight relationship between the o / h and ne / h abundances was found , excluding the modification of both elements by pne progenitors and ensuring oxygen to be a good tracer of the galaxy metallicity .",
    "the average chemical abundances of the pne were compared to the pn population of the lmc , the smc , and the galaxy .",
    "generally speaking , the elemental abundances of the @xmath4-elements of the pne in the disk of m33 are very similar to those of the lmc .",
    "the comparison between m33 pne and regions indicates a negligible global enrichment of the m33 disk from the epoch of the formation of the pn progenitors to the present time .",
    "the radial metallicity gradients of those elements which are not modified during the lifetime of lims oxygen , neon , sulphur were derived .",
    "the best measured element , oxygen , has a slope -0.031 ( @xmath5 0.013 ) dex kpc@xmath6 in agreement within the errors with the same gradient derived from  regions -0.032 ( @xmath5 0.009 ) dex kpc@xmath6 .",
    "since the metallicity gradients of pne and regions are practically indiscernible and the mean abundances of the pn and  region populations are very close , we conclude that the chemical enrichment in m33 from the time of the formation of the pn progenitors to the present - time has been nearly negligible .",
    "pn039 has a wr central star .",
    "its spectrum shows prominent and wide features of he  ii at @xmath20 4686 , 4541 , 5411 and of he  i at @xmath20 4471 , 5876 , 6678 , 7065 .",
    "in addition other stellar lines of [ ciii ] at @xmath20 4056 and 4649 , and [ cii ] at 7107 and 7124 were detected .",
    "the fwhm of these lines is 15 , to be compared instrumental resolution of about 6  .",
    "thus , following the classification of acker & neiner  @xcite pn039 has a late - type [ wc]-9 or [ wc]-10 nucleus due to the presence of very bright [ ciii ] and [ cii ] lines respect to the [ civ ] lines .",
    "the ratio of the sulphur doublet indicates a low density limit @xmath49100 @xmath36 , and , 4363/5007 ratio is completely anomalous for a normal pn , giving an electron temperature @xmath9 30,000 k. the reddening of the nebula is null , within the errors , indicating a little presence of dust .",
