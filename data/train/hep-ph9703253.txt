    "there have been a number of attempts to obtain information on meson resonances from data on the reaction @xmath7 .",
    "earlier work @xcite was restricted to testing the compatibility of data with assumed combinations of breit - wigner resonances and smooth backgrounds .",
    "these analyses used data only on the channel @xmath8 @xcite and the results , in the main , are in strong disagreement with later @xmath9 data @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to use the barrelet zero method @xcite to translate the dips observed in the angular distributions ( cross - sections and asymmetries ) into complex zeros of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "this method requires a number of assumptions to obtain smooth zero trajectories and to fix the overall phase of the solution .",
    "the latter is crucial , because in the absence of an optical theorem the method only determines the moduli and _ relative _ phases of the amplitudes at each energy .",
    "one choice is to assume a breit - wigner form for a particular partial wave , but different choices of input phases , however plausible , lead to different solutions for the partial waves , as can be seen by comparing the results of references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an alternative method of obtaining amplitudes which overcomes the objections to earlier work , is to exploit analyticity via dispersion relations and determine the overall phase by using crossing symmetry to relate the annihilation data to known @xmath10 elastic scattering amplitudes .",
    "this in principle overcomes the problem of the absence of an optical theorem and ensures that the resulting amplitudes not only fit the annihilation data , but are also consistent with the wealth of information on the crossed channel , @xmath10 .",
    "dispersion relations at fixed-@xmath11 or fixed-@xmath12 are unsuitable because of the need to have information in unphysical regions , but this can be avoided by writing dispersion relations along hyperbolae in the mandelstam plane @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite we presented a largely model - independent set of invariant amplitudes , which by construction satisfy analyticity and crossing symmetry and simultaneously give an excellent fit to all @xmath13 data ( both in charged and neutral channels ) existing at the time @xcite and to amplitudes for @xmath10 .",
    "subsequently @xcite we showed that the structure in the invariant amplitudes , which reflects that seen directly in the experimental data , was due to the existence of resonances in the partial wave amplitudes and we presented evidence for resonance activity in four states with spins @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    since our earlier work , new differential cross - section and asymmetry data have been obtained on the @xmath8 channel at 20 center - of - mass energies in the range 1.91 mev to 2.27 mev @xcite using the lear facility at cern .",
    "these data are consistent with the earlier data @xcite , but are more accurate and also extend asymmetry measurements to lower momenta than previous experiments .",
    "however , the new experiments cover a slightly smaller range of energy . here",
    "we present an analysis of the new data , plus the older @xmath16 data @xcite , using as constraints the invariant amplitudes obtained in @xcite , thus indirectly imposing analyticity and crossing symmetry on the solution .",
    "we compare our results with other recent analyses @xcite at the end of this paper .",
    "the analysis of @xcite was performed in terms of the usual @xmath17 invariant amplitudes @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in the @xmath11-channel ,",
    "@xmath20 , it is more convenient to work with @xmath19 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the center - of - mass momentum in the @xmath23 channel ; @xmath24 is the nucleon mass ; and @xmath25 is the scattering angle in the @xmath11-channel . in the helicity basis , these two invariant amplitudes may be expressed in terms of partial - wave amplitudes by the expansions @xmath26 and @xmath27 in these relations , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the partial - wave helicity amplitudes for definite @xmath11-channel isospin @xmath30 corresponding to @xmath11-channel helicity non - flip and flip , respectively , and @xmath11 is the square of the center - of - mass energy in the @xmath11-channel . by bose statistics , @xmath31 and @xmath32 in addition , @xmath33 .",
    "the helicity amplitudes are normalized such that the integrated cross - section for @xmath34 for a definite isospin @xmath30 is @xmath35 an alternative , but equivalent , way of expressing the partial - wave content of the invariant amplitudes is to use the @xmath36 basis .",
    "if we label the new amplitudes by @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 , then , for a fixed value of isospin @xmath30 , they are related to @xmath39 and @xmath40 by @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "we will use both sets of amplitudes in the following discussion .",
    "in@xcite , the invariant amplitudes were obtained along families of hyperbolic curves in the mandelstam plane defined by a parameter @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the pion mass ; @xmath47 is the square of the center - of - mass energy in the @xmath47-channel @xmath10 ; and @xmath48 .",
    "values of @xmath49 were chosen so that the hyperbolae covered the @xmath11-channel region being analysed while staying almost entirely within the physical @xmath47-channel . to obtain amplitudes at the experimental energies , those from ref .",
    "@xcite were linearly interpolated in @xmath11 along the hyperbolae at fixed-@xmath50",
    "the data fitted consisted of experimental differential cross - sections and asymmetries for @xmath51 at 20 momenta in the range 360 mev / c to 1550 mev / c @xcite and , at each momentum , the invariant amplitudes from ref.@xcite at a grid of @xmath49-values ( or equivalently , a grid of values of @xmath52 ) .",
    "in addition , differential cross - sections for @xmath53 were included by interpolating the measured data of ref.@xcite to the momenta of the charged channel data . at each momentum",
    "we minimized the sum of the values for @xmath54 per data point for each type of data .",
    "the parameters are , at each @xmath11-value , the complex amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath55 .",
    "the number of amplitudes used in the partial - wave expansions is dictated by the form of the invariant amplitudes and the need to ensure a good representation of them , and not by criteria such as polynomial fits to the measured angular distributions , which are often truncated where the highest partial wave is still quite large .",
    "this is an important difference between our method and others @xcite which use observables in the form of legendre series truncated at a point where the size of the highest coefficient is actually large .",
    "our interpolation of the t - channel data used a method that makes no assumption about the number of partial waves which are important ( see appendix c of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , although we would expect higher partial waves to be progressively less important at lower momenta .    at each @xmath11-value",
    ", sufficient terms were used to obtain a good fit to each amplitude and to ensure reasonable smoothness of the resulting helicity amplitudes from one @xmath11-value to the next . in practice , 4 - 5 @xmath56-values",
    "were used at the lowest momentum , rising to 6 - 7 at the highest .",
    "initial estimates of @xmath28 and @xmath29 were obtained from @xcite and used as starting values in a simultaneous fit to all the data at a given momentum . in table [ table1 ] we show values of @xmath54 per data point for the differential cross - sections and asymetries in the charged channel and for the amplitudes at each of the twenty momenta . at the higher momenta",
    "we also show values of @xmath54 per data point for the neutral data . in figs",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we show the fits and/or predictions for the @xmath57 and @xmath16 data at three representative momenta .",
    "to give some idea of the quality of the fits to the invariant amplitudes , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the fits to the real and imaginary parts of @xmath58 and @xmath59 as functions of @xmath11 at a fixed value of the hyperbolic parameter , @xmath60 gev@xmath61 .",
    "the extraction of `` hard '' information on resonances from partial - wave amplitudes is a notoriously difficult problem , which has not been solved in a rigorous way even for elastic two - body reactions , and ultimately one has to resort to plausible models",
    ". we will use criteria which have proved successful in analysing reactions such as @xmath10 .",
    "thus , we will use combinations of breit - wigner resonances and flexible non - resonant backgrounds with initial parameters suggested by loops in argand diagrams , enhancements in the integrated partial cross - sections , maxima in amplitude speed plots etc .",
    ", not by fitting the original experimental data . before doing that , however , it is useful to see to what extent the `` continuity '' of the partial - wave amplitudes , which were obtained by a series of fits at fixed values of the energy , is compatible with partial - wave analyticity . to test this",
    "we have fitted the `` raw '' amplitudes with the following parametric forms constructed by analogy with the work of ref.@xcite .",

    "the factor @xmath76 ensures the correct behaviour at the @xmath77 threshold while the factor @xmath78 ensures a suitable high energy behaviour .",
    "we do not attempt to impose the correct behaviour at the @xmath79 pseudo - threshold since this is very far away from the energy region in which we are interested .",
    "the advantage in using such an a representation in the @xmath37 basis is that the @xmath77 threshold behaviour can be easily imposed , whereas in the helicity basis this is more difficult since the threshold behaviours of the two helicity states are correlated .",
    "the price for this decoupling is a correlation between the two @xmath37 basis amplitudes at @xmath80 to avoid a spurious singularity at this point .",
    "however , this is again so far from the energy region in which we are interested that we ignore this problem .",
    "the coefficients @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 in eq.[eq10a ] are determined by fitting the values of @xmath75 at the different @xmath11-values using the pietarinen technique as described in ref . @xcite . in these fits",
    "we use @xmath84 and @xmath85 and are able to achieve good fits ; it should be remarked that in these fits we take no account of correlations , neither between different amplitudes nor between the real and imaginary parts in the same amplitude .",
    "the results of these fits are shown as the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath3 where we show the dimensionless amplitudes @xmath86 the @xmath87 amplitudes are small and featureless and so are not shown .",
    "we conclude that , in the main , the single - energy amplitudes are compatible with partial - wave analyticity within plausible errors . in",
    "what follows , we have used these smooth amplitudes as the starting point for our extraction of resonance information .",
    "this is done for convenience , and it is worth remarking that no extra structure is introduced by the smoothing procedure and that we have checked that our conclusions are unaltered when the `` raw '' amplitudes are fitted .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we also show the contributions of each partial - wave helicity amplitude to the integrated partial cross - section . some systematic features are immediately apparent .",
    "firstly , in a given energy region odd-@xmath56 contributions are larger than those with even-@xmath56 .",
    "this is of course directly related to the experimental observation that the @xmath16 cross - section is approximately 1/3 of the @xmath8 cross - section over the whole of the energy range we consider .",
    "we also note the increasing importance of partial waves with lower @xmath88 as the energy decreases .",
    "many partial waves show counterclockwise loops , with the amplitude moving rapidly over some part of the energy range ; the classic signal of resonance activity . to obtain resonance parameters ,",
    "we have fitted the dimensionless amplitudes with the parametric forms @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the background term the coefficients @xmath92 are complex parameters , and to ensure the correct behaviour at the @xmath77 threshold we set @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a suitable momentum , in practice taken to correspond to @xmath95gev . in the resonance term , the parameters are the mass @xmath96 , the width @xmath97 and the complex residue @xmath98 .",
    "to ensure the correct behaviour at the @xmath99 threshold , we set @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the value of @xmath102 at @xmath103 and @xmath104 is a complex constant .",
    "both amplitudes for a given @xmath56 were fitted simultaneously , and in the absence of a realistic error analysis equal weights were assigned to each point .",
    "the results obtained by fitting the amplitudes as functions of energy , and the associated argand diagrams , are shown as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where it will be seen that the fits are as good as those using the more general parametrization of eq.[eq10a ]    the @xmath105 amplitude shows a clear resonance loop corresponding to a mass of 1.95 gev / c@xmath61 and a width 0.16 gev .",
    "the resonance dominates the real part at low energies , but there is a large background at the upper end of the range .",
    "the imaginary part has significant contributions from both resonance and background terms throughout the entire energy range . in the case of the @xmath106 amplitudes",
    ", there is a clear resonance signal in the @xmath107 amplitude corresponding to a mass of 1.97 gev / c@xmath61 and a width of 0.14 gev .",
    "this is accompanied by a substantial background contribution .",
    "the @xmath108 amplitude is by comparison much smaller . for @xmath109 , both @xmath110 and @xmath111 amplitudes",
    "have resonance behaviour .",
    "the mass is 1.93 gev / c@xmath61 and the width is 0.15 gev .",
    "the @xmath112 state has a resonance in the @xmath113 amplitude with a mass of 2.02 gev / c@xmath61 and a width of 0.22 gev .",
    "the width in the case of the raw amplitudes is slightly larger at 0.26 gev .",
    "the @xmath114 amplitude is very small .",
    "the resonance in the @xmath115 wave , which again is more prominent in the @xmath116 amplitude , has a mass of 2.02 gev / c@xmath61 and a width of 0.14 gev , which rises to 0.26 gev in the case of the raw amplitudes .",
    "the mass is in good agreement with that of the well - established f@xmath117(2050 ) resonance , and the values for the width span the accepted value of 0.21 gev .",
    "the fact that this state emerges clearly from our analysis lends weight to the validity of our procedures and the parameters of the other predicted resonances . in the @xmath118 wave there is evidence for a state at 2.19 gev / c@xmath119 with a width of 0.22 gev , again coupling stronger to the @xmath116 amplitude . finally , there is some evidence for a broad resonance in @xmath87 , but as this is just outside the range of the analysis , and the raw amplitudes shown much more scatter , we do not comment on this possibility further and it is therefore not shown .",
    "the resonance masses and widths are summarised in table [ table2 ] .",
    "where two values are given , the first corresponds to fiting the raw amplitudes and the second to fiting the smoothed amplitudes . in the other cases both values are the same .",
    "table [ table2 ] also gives the values of the product of the branching ratios @xmath120 calculated from the values of the residue parameters @xmath104 .",
    "the only case where there is a well - established resonance is the @xmath121 state f@xmath117(2050 ) with a measured mass of 2.044@xmath1220.011 gev / c@xmath61 and a width of 0.208@xmath1220.013 gev .",
    "if we identify our @xmath115 state with this , we can use the known @xmath123 branching ratio of the f@xmath117(2050 ) of 17% to estimate the @xmath77 branching ratio to be between 2% and 8% , which is not inconsistent with a conventional @xmath124 resonance . if we assume that @xmath123 branching ratios in the range 10 - 20% are also typical of daughter states in this mass range",
    ", then we can see from table [ table2 ] that the other predicted resonances with @xmath125 and @xmath126 have @xmath99 branching ratios similar to that of the f@xmath117(2050 ) . however , the states with @xmath105 and @xmath127 are different and have far larger branching ratios .",
    "indeed for the @xmath105 state the coupling is probably unreasonably large , but in this case there is a very large background accompanying the resonance and in this situation our simple parameterisation may not be appropriate to extract accurate resonance parameters .",
    "such states are unlikely to be conventional @xmath124 mesons , but are more likely to have a multiquark @xmath128 structure @xcite .",
    "three other analyses @xcite of the accurate @xmath129 data @xcite have been published.in ref .",
    "@xcite it is assumed from the outset that the data can be fitted by partial - wave amplitudes each of which is parameterised in terms of towers of nearly degenerate resonances .",
    "the analysis then fits all the data @xcite simultaneously .",
    "the motivation for this assumption is based on qualitative features of the data , such as the persistence of a very large polarization over a wide energy range , but nevertheless is really only testing the compatibility of the data with an assumed parametric form , like analyses of earlier data @xcite .",
    "the resulting speed plots show little evidence for resonance - like behaviour and only the @xmath115 and @xmath126 amplitudes show clear peaks .",
    "this illustrates the strong correlations that exist between the states in the various towers and makes it difficult to ascribe much reliability to the parameters of individual resonances .",
    "this is further illustrated by the predicted values of @xmath130 which , with the sole exception of the @xmath115 state , where the mass and width were fixed from experiment , all indicate very large branching ratios to the @xmath77 channel .    the analysis of ref . @xcite is based on the barrelet method @xcite and therefore has the usual problems intrinsic to that method associated with the unresolved phase .",
    "the initially very large number of possible solutions is reduced by using the @xmath16 data @xcite and further reduced by imposing threshold behaviour on the way zeros appear , leaving just two solutions ( a and b ) , both of which exhibit resonances which for ( b ) are in all waves from @xmath105 to @xmath115 .",
    "finally , a simple amplitude analysis has been made @xcite which finds no compelling evidence for any resonances .",
    "however , the analysis only used data in the restricted momentum range of 360 mev / c to 988 mev / c and is therefore not strictly comparable with the other analyses reported here .    the work of ref .",
    "@xcite is the most complete of the published analyses , but it is difficult to make a meaningful comparison with our own because of the significant difference in the input data to these two analyses i.e. our inclusion of invariant amplitudes and , via these , the requirement that the solution should be consistent with information in the @xmath131 channel . to see the importance of this ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the prediction of the solutions of ref .",
    "@xcite for the invariant amplitudes as functions of @xmath11 at the fixed value of @xmath132 gev@xmath61 together with our own fit to these amplitudes .",
    "it is clear , that despite the considerable errors on the invariant amplitudes , they do provide important constraints which are not satisfied by either of the solutions of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are some common results found in both analyses .",
    "both find a clear signal for the f@xmath117(2050 ) , and both find its coupling to the @xmath133 amplitude is much stronger than to @xmath134 . also , both analyses yield a low - lying @xmath105 state with a suggestion of abnormally large coupling to the @xmath99 channel .",
    "agreement for other waves is much less good .",
    "for example , for @xmath135 ref .",
    "@xcite finds a resonance only in solution b and it couples mainly to @xmath136 , whereas the @xmath135 resonance in our solution , although it has similar parameters , couples mainly to @xmath137 . likewise , there are substantial differences in masses , widths and couplings for the @xmath109 and @xmath138 waves .",
    "one place where it may be possible to decide between the various solutions is in the @xmath53 channel where dcs data exist for only a limited momentum range .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] our predictions together with those of ref .",
    "@xcite for the differential cross section and asymmetry in this channel at a lower momentum where there are no measurements . in the same figure",
    "we also show similar predictions at two higher momenta where measurements of the differential cross section exist @xcite .    in conclusion , we summarise our overall findings .",
    "we have analysed data on @xmath139 , including very accurate data in the @xmath140 channel , using constraints from crossing symmetry and analyticity to impose consistency of the solution with information on data in the @xmath10 channel .",
    "overall , we have found evidence for a rich spectrum of resonances whose couplings , with one or two exceptions , are in the range expected for normal daughter meson states with a @xmath141 structure .",
    "the exceptions are in low j states and have couplings far larger than expected .",
    "this may indicate the presence of more complex multi - quark structures with large couplings to the @xmath77 channel as expected in some models @xcite .",
