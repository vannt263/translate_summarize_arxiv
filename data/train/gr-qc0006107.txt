    "to unlock the puzzle of quantum gravity , and understand quantum spacetime , we have to learn how to treat general relativistic quantum field theories in a background independent fashion@xcite .",
    "a surprising number of research directions aimed at exploring background independent quantum field theory have recently been converging towards the spin foam formalism @xcite .",
    "a spin foam model can be seen as a rigorous implementation of the wheeler - misner - hawking @xcite sum over geometries formulation of quantum gravity .",
    "the foam - like geometries summed over are spin foams , or colored 2-complexes .",
    "a 2-complex @xmath1 is a ( combinatorial ) set of elements called `` vertices '' @xmath2 , `` edges '' @xmath3 and `` faces '' @xmath4 , and a boundary relation among these , such that an edge is bounded by two vertices , and a face is bounded by a cyclic sequence of contiguous edges ( edges sharing a vertex ) . a spin foam is a 2-complex plus a  coloring \" @xmath5 , that is an assignment of an irreducible representation @xmath6 of a given group @xmath7 to each face @xmath4 and of an intertwiner @xmath8 to each edge @xmath3 .",
    "the model is defined by the partition function : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dimension of the representation @xmath5 , @xmath11 is an amplitude associated to vertices : a given function of the colorings of the faces and edges adjacent to the vertex ; and @xmath12 is a normalization factor for each 2-complex .",
    "let us mention a few of the research directions that , following very different paths , have converged to models of this kind .",
    "one of the oldest models of this type is the ponzano and regge formulation of 2 + 1 gravity @xcite .",
    "the 2-complexes in this case are the 2-skeleta of the dual of regge triangulations , and the vertex amplitude turns out to be simply a wigner @xmath13 6j symbol . in loop quantum gravity @xcite",
    ", spin foams emerge as histories ( in coordinate time ) of quantum states of the geometry @xcite , that is , histories of spin networks@xcite . in this case",
    ", the vertex amplitude @xmath14 is given by the matrix elements of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "in covariant lattice approaches , the sum over colors corresponds to the integration over group elements associated to links , expressed in a ( `` fourier '' ) mode expansion over the group . in this case",
    "the vertex amplitude @xmath14 is a discretized version of ( the exponential of ) the lagrangian density @xcite . in topological field theories ,",
    "the vertex function is a natural object in the representation theory of the group @xmath7 , satisfying a set of identities that assure triangulation independence @xcite .",
    "finally , in the modifications of topological quantum field theories related to quantum general relativity @xcite , the topological field theory vertex amplitude is altered in order to incorporate a quantum version of the constraints that reduces the bf topological field theory @xcite to general relativity .",
    "spin foams are very much analogous to feynman diagrams . in references",
    "@xcite , indeed , it is shown that the sum ( [ z ] ) can be obtained as a feynman expansion of a field theory over a group manifold , whose interaction terms determine the vertex amplitude ( see also @xcite ) . in this context , spacetime emerges from a feynman expansion , as in the old 2d quantum gravity matrix models , or zero - dimensional string theory @xcite .",
    "as in the feynman expansions of a conventional field theory , one expects divergences to appear in the sum .",
    "there are two types of potential divergences : the ones associated to the sum over the colors of a fixed 2-complex , and the ones associated with the sum over 2-complexes . here",
    "we consider only divergences of the first kind . in conventional feynman diagrammatics ,",
    "divergences are originated by integrating over the momenta circulating along closed loops , because momentum conservation at the vertices relates the momenta of adjacent propagators . in a spin foams model ,",
    "the sum is over representations associated to faces , and a constraint analogous to momentum conservation is provided by the requirement of the existence of non trivial intertwiners on the edges .",
    "consequently , divergences are associated not to loops , as in quantum field theory , but rather to",
    "_ bubbles _ : collections of faces forming a closed surface @xcite .",
    "a way to control bubble divergences is to replace the group @xmath7 with a @xmath15-deformed group , choosing @xmath15 such that @xmath16 , and to sum only over the finite set of proper representations of the quantum group .",
    "this is done , for instance , in the turaev - viro @xcite finite version of the ponzano - regge theory .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 plays the role of a cutoff , and the physical theory is recovered by appropriately taking the @xmath17 limit .",
    "the significance of the bubble divergences depends on whether the model is topological .",
    "a topological field theory is a diffeomorphism invariant theory which does not have local degrees of freedom , but only global ones .",
    "general relativity in 3 spacetime dimensions and bf theory are topological theories . on the other hand ,",
    "a non - topological diffeomorphism - invariant theory is a theory , such as general relativity in 4d , which is generally covariant but , nevertheless , has local degrees of freedom ( waves ) . in the context of spin foam models",
    ", the fact that a theory is topological is reflected in the fact that the amplitude of a fixed 2-complex in ( [ z ] ) is independent from the 2-complex ( triangulation independence ones the manifold , i.e. , the topology is fixed ) .",
    "more precisely , in general , in a topological model , bubble amplitudes diverges in the @xmath17 limit , but topological invariance implies that the sum over colorings is the same as the one of a 2-complex in which the bubble has been removed , up to a divergent overall factor that depends only on the cutoff . in this case , therefore , divergent diagrams do not provide any additional information .",
    "the fact that a topological theory does not have local degrees of freedom is reflected in the triviality of all its  radiative corrections \" ( bubble diagrams ) .",
    "the consequence is that the sum over 2-complexes is trivial , and can be dropped , thus dropping all 2-complexes with bubbles .",
    "the situation is different in the non - topological context , and in particular , for quantum general relativity . in this case , the  radiative corrections \" , that is , the bubble amplitudes , are the ones that carry the information about the quantum behavior of the local degrees of freedom of the theory . in this context",
    "the sum over 2-complexes is necessary in order to capture all the degrees of freedom of the theory , and bubble amplitudes are physically important .",
    "examples of non - topological models are the covariant expansion in coordinate time obtained from loop quantum gravity , the iwasaki@xcite and the reisenberger@xcite models , and the barrett - crane model .",
    "the barrett - crane model is a non - topological modification of a topological model : 4d @xmath18 bf theory , or the tocy ( turaev - ooguri - barrett - yetter ) model @xcite .",
    "it is well known that 4d @xmath18 bf theory has a peculiar relation with 4d euclidean general relativity : general relativity can be seen as a 4d @xmath18 bf theory plus a constraint , which has an intriguing geometrical interpretation .",
    "the barrett - crane model is a modification of the tocy model in which this constraint is implemented in the quantum theory @xcite . as a consequence of the constraints ,",
    "topological invariance is lost and the model acquires local degrees of freedom .",
    "radiative corrections associated to bubble diagrams carry non trivial physical information , but , unfortunately , diverge @xcite . in order to be able to extract physical information from this model",
    "it is necessary to deal with these divergences .    in a companion paper @xcite ,",
    "we have begun a general study of the bubble amplitudes and the possible ways of renormalizing away their infinities ( see also @xcite ) . in particular , we have studied the version of the barrett - crane model developed in @xcite , in which the sum over complexes is explicitly implemented by obtaining the spin foam model from a field theory over a group manifold . in the course of this analysis , we have stumbled across a remarkable simple modification of the action of the barrett - crane model which leads to finite fundamental bubble amplitudes .",
    "we present this model in the present paper .",
    "we also argue that all  radiative corrections \" in the model are likely to be finite .",
    "the model we present shares with the original barrett - crane model the feature that makes it an intriguing candidate for a quantum theory of ( euclidean ) 4d general relativity : that is , it is another implementation of the constraint that reduces bf to gr . as a result , we obtain a theory , formally related to euclidean quantum general relativity , presumably finite at all orders in the expansion over 2-complexes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we recall the field theory formulation of spin foam models by discussing the tocy model@xcite , and the barrett - crane model ; then we introduce the new model . in section iii , we study the model in configuration space .",
    "we define and compute the amplitudes corresponding to the fundamental bubble diagrams .",
    "we prove finiteness of the 1-bubble diagram . in section iv , we study the model in momentum space where we show that the interaction vertex of the theory is the barrett - crane vertex .",
    "we also give another proof of the finiteness of the 5-bubble amplitude .",
    "in the appendix we review some known facts about the representation theory of @xmath18 , and we prove certain inequalities satisfied by the barrett - crane vertex amplitude , the @xmath19 , and the @xmath20-symbols .",
    "we use these inequalities to show the finiteness of the fundamental bubble diagrams .",
    "they generalize to the @xmath21-symbols .",
    "we begin by recalling the formulation of quantum bf theory , and of the barrett - crane euclidean quantum gravity , as field theories on a group manifold .",
    "these were first developed by ooguri in @xcite and by depietri et al in @xcite .",
    "then we introduce the new model .",
    "a spin foam model can be cast in the form of a field theory over a group manifold @xcite .",
    "the simplest of these theories is given by the tocy @xcite topological model , corresponding to the quantization of @xmath18 4-dimensional bf theory .",
    "we begin by describing this model , which allows us to introduce definitions relevant in the sequel .",

    "+    from now on we will use the greek letter @xmath50 to denote the symmetrization integration variables associated to vertices , while we reserve the letter @xmath51 for propagators .",
    "the feynman diagrams of the theory are obtained by connecting the five - valent vertices with propagators . at the open ends of propagators and vertices",
    "there are the four group variables corresponding to the arguments of the field . for a fixed permutation @xmath27 in each propagator",
    ", one can follow the sequence of delta functions with common arguments across vertices and propagators . on a closed graph",
    ", each such sequence must close . by associating a surface to each such sequence of propagators ,",
    "we construct a 2-complex @xcite .",
    "thus , by expanding in feynman diagrams and in the sum over permutations in ( [ propo1 ] ) , we obtain a sum over 2-complexes . in other words , a 2-complex",
    "is given by a certain vertices - propagators topology plus a fixed choice of a permutation on each propagator .",
    "from now on , a  feynman diagram \" , or simply a diagram , will denote one such 2-complexes .    according to the standard feynman rules deduced from the form of the action",

    "thus , the amplitude of any feynman diagram is given by an integral of a product of delta functions over a ( compact ) group manifold . from ( [ p ] ) and ( [ v5 ] ) we observe that the integrand defining this amplitude correspond to a product of delta functions related to each other according to fig .",
    "[ prop ] and [ vertex ] .",
    "working in configuration space , one can easily prove the topological invariance of the theory using the feynman rules derived from ( [ actionwithp])@xcite . if one expands the action ( [ actionwithp ] ) in terms of irreducible representations using the peter - weyl theorem , then the amplitude of a feynman diagram @xmath1 is @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the @xmath20-symbol constructed out of the 10 colors of the surfaces meeting at the vertex plus the five colors of the intertwiners corresponding to the five edges defining the vertex .",

    "notice that the action ( [ bcm ] ) is simply obtained by adding the @xmath58 projection to the the action ( [ actionwithp ] ) of the topological tocy .",

    "alternatively , this constraint allows one to identify the generators as bivectors defining elementary surfaces in 4d , and thus to interpret the coloring of a two - simplex as the choice of a ( discretized ) 4d geometry @xcite .    using equations ( [ pg ] ) , and ( [ ph ] ) it",
    "is straightforward to compute the kinetic operator and the interaction vertex of the barrett - crane model in coordinate space .",

    ", the propagator @xmath73 does not have a simple form in coordinate space .",
    "if we expands the action ( [ bcm ] ) in terms of irreducible representations using the peter - weyl theorem , then the amplitude of a given feynman diagram @xmath1 is given by @xmath74 where the sum is now only over simple representations of @xmath18 , and @xmath75 denotes barrett - crane vertex amplitude .",
    "this is given by the @xmath20-symbol constructed out of the 10 colors of the surfaces meeting at the vertex using the barrett - crane intertwiners .",
    "see ( [ bbcc ] ) and ( @xcite ) .",
    "the idea at the basis of the new model is the same as in barrett - crane : to modify the bf action ( [ actionwithp ] ) by inserting the projector ( [ ph ] ) which implements the restriction of bf to gr .",
    "however , this time we insert the projection in the interaction term only , keeping the same kinetic term as in the bf theory .",
    "that is , we define the new model by the action @xmath76=\\int dg_i \\left [ p_{g } \\phi(g_i ) \\right]^2 + { \\lambda \\over 5 ! }",
    "\\int dg_i \\left [ p_{g}p_{h}\\phi(g_i ) \\right]^5\\ ] ] or @xmath77=\\int dg_i \\left [ p_{g } \\phi(g_i ) \\right]^2 + { \\lambda \\over 5 ! } \\int dg_i \\left [   p_{g}p_{h}p_{g}\\phi(g_i ) \\right]^5.\\ ] ] where @xmath78 and @xmath33 are defined in ( [ pg ] ) , and ( [ ph ] ) respectively . as for the barrett - crane model , if we drop @xmath78 from the previous action we obtain the tocy topological model of section ( ii ) . as we show below",
    ", the two forms of the action define the same theory , since the extra @xmath33 in the second expression can be always absorbed into the @xmath33 of some propagator when computing an amplitude .",
    "the second form of the action simplifies the analysis of the theory in momentum space .    from ( [ tope ] )",
    "the kinetic operator becomes @xmath79 which corresponds to the projector into the space of gauge invariant fields ( @xmath42 ) . in this space",
    "its inverse is itself and the propagator of the theory is simply @xmath80 as in the tocy model .",
    "the vertex of the theory is @xmath81 the @xmath50 and @xmath82 integration variables correspond to the two projectors @xmath33 in the interaction . in the following",
    "we will show that the @xmath82 integration is redundant when computing any amplitude , and therefore the two expressions in ( [ tope ] ) and ( [ tope2 ] ) define the same theory .",
    "the key feature of this model is that , as we will argue in the following , it does not contain divergences associated to the sum over colors for fundamental bubble diagrams .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , and discussed in detail in ref.@xcite , in a spin foam model divergences arise in feynman diagrams containing bubbles , that is , closed surfaces .",
    "bubbles are the spin foam analog of the loop diagrams of standard qft . to begin the analysis",
    ", we consider here only 2-complexes that are ( the two skeleton of the ) dual of regular triangulations .",
    "therefore , we will talk equivalently about triangulations or 2-complexes .",
    "we define a _ fundamental bubble diagram _ as a bubble diagram obtained from an elementary diagram without bubbles by means of the basic 4d pachner moves on the corresponding triangulation .",
    "these are the simplest diagrams presenting bubbles , and , in this sense , _ fundamental bubble diagrams _ are analogous to one - loop diagrams in standard qft , representing the basic potentially divergent amplitudes in the model .    in four dimensions",
    "there are 3 possible pachner moves the 1 - 5 , the 2 - 4 , and the 3 - 3 pachner moves respectively plus their inverses . only the 1 - 5 and the 2 - 4 pachner moves generate bubbles . in terms of a 4d triangulation , the 1 - 5 move is defined by the split of a 4-simplex into five 4-simplices .",
    "more precisely , we put a point @xmath83 in the interior of the 4-simplex with vertices @xmath84 , we add the five segments @xmath85 , the ten triangles @xmath86 , the ten tetrahedra @xmath87 , and the five 4-simplices @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 ) .    in the 2 - 4 move ,",
    "we replace the two 4-simplexes @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , sharing the tetrahedron @xmath92 with the four 4-simplices @xmath93 where @xmath94 .    in terms of the 2-complex ( the 2-skeleton of the dual of the triangulation ) which represent feynman diagrams of our field theory ,",
    "this set of moves generate the two _ fundamental bubble diagrams_. the 1 - 5 move in the dual picture is illustrated in fig .  [",
    "we denote the diagram on the right as the _ 5-bubble diagram_. the vertices of the picture are dual to the 4-simplexes of the triangulation ; the edges of the picture are dual to the tetrahedra of the triangulation ; the surfaces ( in fact , here , all the triangles ) are dual to the triangles of the triangulation .",
    "the amplitude of a closed diagram is a number .",
    "the amplitude of an open diagram , that is , a diagram with a boundary , is a function of the variables on the boundary , as for conventional qft feynman diagrams .",
    "the boundary of a 2-complex is given by a graph , where the nodes are generated by the intersections of the edges with the boundary , and the links are generated by the intersections of the surfaces with the boundary .",
    "to start with , the amplitude of the open diagram is a function of 4 group arguments per each external line .",
    "however , consider a surface of an open 2-complex and the link @xmath95 of the boundary graph that bounds it .",
    "let @xmath96 and @xmath97 be the nodes on the boundary graph that bound @xmath95 .",
    "the surface determines a sequence of delta functions that starts with one of the group elements in @xmath96 , say @xmath98 and ends with one of the group elements in @xmath97 , say @xmath99 . by integrating internal variables all these delta functions",
    "can be contracted to a single delta function of the form @xmath100 .",
    "this is of course a function of @xmath101 .",
    "we can thus define the group variable @xmath102 , naturally associated to the link @xmath95 , and conclude that the amplitude of an open 2-complex is a function @xmath103 of one group element per each link of its boundary graph . in  momentum space \" , the amplitude of the diagram is a function over the possible colorings , in the sense of the spin networks , of the boundary graph .",
    "that is , if @xmath104 is a spin network given by a coloring of the boundary graph , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the spin network function@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ 15 ] , the thin lines in the picture represent the boundary graph of the diagram , that is the intersection of the 2-complex with a 3-sphere that bounds it .",
    "this intersection is a graph on the 3-sphere .",
    "notice that the boundary remains the same after the move is implemented .",
    "we can think of the diagram on the right as a radiative correction to the diagram on the left .",
    "the analogous picture is shown in fig .",

    "we start by computing the amplitude @xmath107 corresponding to the diagram on the right of fig .",
    "we use the second form of the action ( [ tope2 ] ) and show that the result is independent of this choice .",
    "the amplitude is a function of the group elements on the external propagators .",
    "it is obtained by writing the five vertices and the ten propagators in the diagram , and integrating on each propagator - vertex contraction .",
    "notice that we are computing the amplitude of a fixed 2-complex , and therefore the permutation in ( [ propo1 ] ) is already fixed , and we do not have to sum over permutations .",
    "let us introduce some notation .",
    "we label the five vertices in fig.[15 ] by means of an index @xmath96 that takes values from 1 to 5 .",
