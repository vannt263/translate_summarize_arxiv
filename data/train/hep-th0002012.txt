    "the f - theory vacuum @xcite constructed from an elliptically fibered   threefold @xmath2 with section determines an effective theory with @xmath3 supersymmetry in six dimensions .",
    "such supersymmetric theories will have fields in hypermultiplets , vector supermultiplets and tensor supermultiplets .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite for a discussion of such theories . )    for any particular f - theory vacuum , the taxonomy of the supermultiplets may be derived from the geometry of @xmath2 as an elliptic fibration via seemingly straightforward methods in the case of the vector and tensor multiplets @xcite .",
    "the classification of the hypermultiplet content has always been a little harder to carry out .",
    "many methods have been proposed which allow the hypermultiplets to be determined from the geometry in certain cases @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to outline a systematic approach to the problem of determining the gauge symmetry and hypermultiplet content of a given six - dimensional theory obtained from f - theory .",
    "( note that as far as the moduli space of hypermultiplets in concerned , our methods utilize the associated type iia compactification and thus also apply directly to the compactification of m - theory on @xmath2 giving an @xmath4 theory in five dimensions and to the compactification of the type iia string on @xmath2 to yield an @xmath5 theory in four dimensions , provided that the expectation values of certain ramond ",
    "ramond fields have been tuned appropriately . )",
    "the methods we employ will not be particularly new but we will see that the process of analyzing the gauge group and matter content can be quite a bit more subtle than had previously been appreciated . in particular , the case of monodromy of the fibration leading to non - simply - laced lie algebras requires some care . a particularly awkward case which has caused some confusion",
    "is when a @xmath6 monodromy acts on a curve of @xmath0 singularities , i.e. , a curve of @xmath7 fibers in f - theory language . in this paper",
    "we resolve this problem in agreement with an observation by intriligator and rajesh in @xcite concerning anomaly cancellation .    in section [ s : lcy ] we will show how many features of a lie algebra structure arise naturally from an elliptically fibered  threefold .",
    "this will allow us to elucidate the method for determining the gauge algebra . in section [ s :",
    "hyper ] we discuss exactly how to analyze the hypermultiplet content in the cases where the associated curves and surfaces within the  threefold are smooth .",
    "we discuss the cases where these curves and surfaces are singular in section [ s : odd ] .",
    "this section includes some unexpected rules we are forced to adopt for @xmath1-brane wrapping",
    ". although the results of this section are less rigorous than the preceding section , we are able to give precise results in many instances which can be extended to the general case under the fairly conservative assumption that the relevant physics is determined locally from the geometry of the singularities .",
    "finally in section [ s : num ] we emphasize the peculiar numerical predictions which arise from anomaly cancellation in the f - theory compactification on @xmath2 .",
    "we begin with a  threefold @xmath2 which admits an elliptic fibration @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a complex surface , and also assume that this elliptic fibration has a section .- field has been turned on in the base @xcite .",
    "] the type iia string compactified on @xmath2 yields an effective four - dimensional theory with @xmath5 supersymmetry ; its strong - coupling limit , known as `` m - theory compactified on @xmath2 , '' yields an effective five - dimensional theory .",
    "one more effective spatial dimension is obtained in a limit in which the areas of all components of the elliptic fibers shrink to zero  this is the `` f - theory limit . ''",
    "see , for example , @xcite for an explanation of this .",
    "we point out that most of the following analysis does not really depend upon this elliptic fibration structure and applies to m - theory and type iia compactifications of @xmath2 .",
    "we use the f - theory language as an organizational tool to give examples later on .",
    "one also has the advantage in f - theory of being able to use anomaly cancellation as a powerful tool in checking the consistency of results concerning spectra of massless particles . in the f - theory context",
    "we can freely exchange the notion of , say , an @xmath10 fiber and an @xmath11 singularity .",
    "the former is the elliptic fibration description for the latter .",
    "recall @xcite that this is because although @xmath10 is really the _ extended _ dynkin diagram of @xmath11 and that one always ignores the components of the fiber which hit the chosen section of the elliptic fibration .",
    "thus , in the zero - area fiber limit of f - theory , a shrunken @xmath10 fiber gives the same physics as an @xmath11 singularity one dimension lower .",
    "whenever rational curves in @xmath2 are shrunk down to zero size we expect @xmath1-branes of the type iia string wrapped around these curves to contribute massless particles to the spectrum .",
    "it is precisely these massless states which are the focus of our interest in this paper .",
    "actually we need to be careful with the statement that massless states appear automatically when a brane wraps a vanishing cycle .",
    "there is always the subtlety of @xmath12-fields and r - r fields which should be tuned to the right value ( usually denoted `` zero '' by convention ) to really obtain a massless state .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite the relevant parameters to worry about in this context are the r - r fields .",
    "we may see this as follows .",
    "if one considers the type iia string compactified on @xmath2 then deformations of the khler form ( and @xmath12-field ) on @xmath2 are given by vector moduli .",
    "suppose we use these khler moduli to shrink down a holomorphic @xmath1-cycle to obtain an enhanced gauge symmetry .",
    "once we reach this point of enhanced symmetry we may have a phase transition releasing new hypermultiplet degrees of freedom .",
    "thus at the point of phase transition , these new parameters , which include r - r fields , are fixed at some value . reversing this point of view",
    ", we may tune parameters in the hypermultiplet moduli space to achieve an enhanced gauge symmetry but these parameters include r - r fields . thus we need to assume always that the r - r parameters have been tuned to the appropriate values required to obtain the enhanced gauge symmetries we discuss below .",
    "witten @xcite analyzed how to determine the massless particle content for a given configuration of rational curves .",
    "let us assume that a given rational curve lives in a family parametrized by a moduli space @xmath13",
    ". in the simplest case one has an embedding @xmath14 .",
    "an isolated rational curve is a trivial example of this where @xmath13 is simply a point .    according to witten s calculation",
    ", one half - hypermultiplet may be associated to the fact that a @xmath1-brane breaks half of the supersymmetry .",
    "this half - hypermultiplet is then tensored with the total cohomology of @xmath13 in an appropriate sense .",
    "the result is that if @xmath13 is a point , then we simply obtain a single half - hypermultiplet .",
    "if @xmath13 is an algebraic curve of genus @xmath15 then we obtain a single vector multiplet and @xmath15 hypermultiplets .",
    "this was also argued by a different method in @xcite .",
    "note that for any wrapping we may also wrap with the opposite orientation to double this spectrum .    of central interest to us",
    "is the fact that compactifying a type iia string theory ( and thus m - theory and f - theory ) on a  threefold @xmath2 produces a theory with a yang  mills sector .",
    "the gauge fields may be viewed as arising from integrating the r - r @xmath16-form of the type iia string over @xmath1-cycles in @xmath2 to produce @xmath17-forms .- form field over @xmath1-cycles . ]",
    "these @xmath17-forms play the role of the yang - mills connection .",
    "in addition , the @xmath18-cycles in @xmath2 which are dual ( via intersection theory ) to these @xmath1-cycles will play an important role .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the @xmath18-form field strength of the r - r @xmath16-form in the type iia string .",
    "note that the @xmath1-branes of the type iia theory are _ electrically _ charged under this field  that is @xmath20 for a @xmath21-dimensional shape @xmath22 ( such as a six - sphere ) enclosing the seven directions transverse to a fundamental @xmath1-brane .    upon compactification we will be wrapping @xmath1-branes around a @xmath1-cycle in @xmath2 to produce a point particle in four - dimensional space - time .",
    "to find the charge of this resulting particle we may take @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a sphere in four dimensional space - time enclosing the particle and @xmath25 is a @xmath18-cycle within @xmath2 .",
    "it follows that in the type iia compactification    1 .",
    "we have @xmath26 gauge symmetries of the type @xmath27 , each labelled by an element of @xmath28 , in addition to the @xmath29 gauge symmetry coming from the r - r @xmath17-form ( whose charge is measured using @xmath30 , the generator of @xmath31 ) .",
    "2 .   if a @xmath1-brane wraps a @xmath1-cycle @xmath32 to produce a particle then the `` electric '' charge of this particle under the @xmath27 symmetry associated to a @xmath18-cycle @xmath25 will be the intersection number @xmath33 .",
    "we thus obtain a perturbative @xmath34 gauge symmetry in type iia . in the m - theory compactification",
    ", there is no r - r @xmath17-form , and the eight transverse directions to the m - theory @xmath1-brane are enclosed by @xmath35 , so the total `` perturbative '' gauge symmetry is given by @xmath36 . in the f - theory limit ,",
    "the only @xmath18-cycles which contribute gauge fields are those with intersection number zero with the elliptic fiber ; moreover , @xmath18-cycles which are the inverse images of @xmath1-cycles in the base @xmath9 are associated to tensor multiplets rather than gauge fields .",
    "thus , in the f - theory limit , we get a `` perturbative '' gauge symmetry group of @xmath37 .",
    "as is now well - known , and as we will discuss , the wrapped @xmath1-branes will elevate this @xmath38 gauge symmetry to a non - abelian lie group ( since certain wrapped branes include vector multiplets in their spectra ) , where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , or @xmath41 for iia , m - theory or f - theory , respectively .",
    "from now on we will concern ourselves only with the lie _ algebra _ of the gauge symmetry .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that , at least in f - theory , the global structure of the gauge group may be recovered from the mordell - weil group of @xmath2 as an elliptic fibration . of the gauge group",
    "is equal to the mordell - weil group ( including both the free and torsion parts ) . ]",
    "if this @xmath42 appears as the cartan subalgebra of our gauge algebra then the discussion above implies that we may make the following identifications .",
    "let @xmath43 be the ( real ) cartan subalgebra , let @xmath44 be the dual space , and let @xmath45 be the coroot lattice and @xmath46 be the weight lattice so that the cartan subgroup @xmath38 is naturally identified with @xmath47 . for the iia compactification , we take @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and in m - theory , we take @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in f - theory , we begin with the orthogonal complement within @xmath28 of the elliptic fiber @xmath52 , and then we mod out by @xmath53 ( that is , @xmath54^\\perp/\\pi^{-1}h_2(\\sigma)\\subset h_4(x)/\\pi^{-1}h_2(\\sigma)$ ] ) ; we then take @xmath55 to be the dual lattice of @xmath56 . in each case , a @xmath1-brane wrapped around a particular @xmath1-cycle is then naturally associated with an element of the weight lattice and its charges under the cartan subalgebra are given in the standard way .",
    "we work this out in detail in several particular cases .",
    "consider first the case that @xmath2 contains a `` ruled '' complex surface @xmath57 admitting a fibration @xmath58 , for some @xmath13 , where all fibers are isomorphic to @xmath59 . the fibers will shrink down to zero size in the f - theory limit .",
    "the simplest example of this is @xmath60 where @xmath13 is a riemann surface of genus @xmath15 and that @xmath61 is in the fiber direction .",
    "that is to say , in our elliptic fibration @xmath8 we have a curve @xmath62 over which the fiber is i@xmath63 .",
    "clearly we have massless states appearing for the @xmath1-branes wrapped around @xmath64 .",
    "we also have a @xmath65 symmetry associated to @xmath66 .",
    "let us consider the normal bundle of a single @xmath64 curve .",
    "this normal bundle may be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 by the adjunction formula and the fact that @xmath2 is a  space . since this curve",
    "may be translated along the @xmath13 direction one of these line bundles must be trivial .",
    "thus the normal bundle is @xmath69 where the @xmath70 describes the normal bundle direction which is also normal to @xmath71 .",
    "therefore @xmath72 .",
    "this tells us that we have a vector supermultiplet and @xmath15 hypermultiplets from wrapping @xmath1-branes around @xmath73 all with charge @xmath74 with respect to the @xmath65 gauge symmetry associated to this divisor .",
    "similarly by wrapping with the opposite orientation we obtain a copy of this except with charge @xmath75 .",
    "these vector supermultiplets enhance the @xmath65 symmetry to @xmath76 in the usual way and we have an additional @xmath15 hypermultiplets in the adjoint representation .",
    "the key point is to notice in this construction that the condition @xmath77 has played the role of the _ cartan matrix _ of @xmath76 .",
    "the next simplest case is where we have a set of curves @xmath78 which may intersect each other and are each isomorphic to @xmath59 and lying in the fiber direction .",
    "we assume that @xmath79 embeds algebraically into @xmath2 .",
    "distinct @xmath59 fibrations over @xmath13 along appropriate disjoint sections , forming a chain . in the remainder of this paper , we will continue to explain by example and will not explicitly state the most general form of the algebraic surfaces which contract to @xmath13 in the f - theory limit .",
    "] we now have a cartan matrix given purely by the configuration of @xmath78 . applying the above method we obtain the standard f - theory result of a simply - laced enhanced gauge symmetry as listed , for example , in table 4 of @xcite .",

    "this phenomenon of obtaining a non - simply - laced symmetry algebra was first noted in @xcite inspired by the construction of @xcite .",
    "there it was explained by monodromy acting on the fibers as follows .",
    "let @xmath80 be embedded in @xmath9 and let @xmath81 be a two - fold cover of @xmath80 ( branched at various points ) . over a generic point in @xmath80",
    "we see that , ignoring the component meeting the chosen section , the kodaira fiber consists of one line from @xmath71 and two lines from @xmath89 forming the ( dual ) dynkin diagram of @xmath90 . moving along a closed path in the complement of the set of branch points of @xmath85 we will exchange the two lines in @xmath89 .",
    "this action on the dynkin diagram is induced by an _",
    "outer automorphism _ of @xmath90 and the invariant subgroup under this outer automorphism can be taken to be @xmath87 .",
    "one might therefore suspect that the effective gauge algebra is the monodromy - invariant subalgebra of the simply - laced gauge symmetry generated locally by the vanishing cycles .",

    ", the outer automorphism is an involution , but this is not a requirement in general .",
    "we see then that the method of directly working out the cartan matrix from intersection theory is a better way to determine the effective gauge algebra in f - theory than trying to find subalgebras invariant under outer automorphisms .",
    "the latter method is ambiguous .",
    "one might try to assert that f - theory picks out the `` maximal '' invariant subalgebra under all possible outer automorphisms .",
    "indeed , @xmath103 is `` bigger '' than @xmath104 in as much as it has a larger dimension ( although in general @xmath105 ) .",

    "note that in the m - theory or type iia compactifications , an ambiguity of the sort we have discovered is actually to be expected . as we have already pointed out , if the ramond ",
    "ramond fields have non - zero expectation values then some of the non - abelian gauge fields will become massive ; when these are integrated out , the gauge group becomes smaller .",
    "this is precisely what happens when the outer automorphism of the covering lie group is varied in the construction above .",
    "the gauge algebra which we wish to determine is the one in which these effects have been turned off so that the f - theory limit can be taken .",
    "( a similar phenomenon of variable gauge group depending on the precise value of an outer automorphism has been observed in a closely related context by witten @xcite , and applied in @xcite ) .",
    "in the last section we described how to determine the gauge algebra in f - theory ( or m - theory or iia string theory ) by determining the cartan matrix from intersection theory .",
    "similar methods will in principle determine the hypermultiplet spectrum completely as we now discuss .",
    "first there can be the case of a family of rational curves acquiring extra rational curves at certain points in the family . in the context of elliptic fibrations",
    "this can be seen as collisions of curves in @xmath9 over which there are singular fibers .",

    "therefore we do not really seem to know what the gauge algebra is .",
    "the geometry seems to suggest @xmath225 or @xmath103 while the outer automorphism argument suggests @xmath103 or @xmath227 .",

    "this assertion corrects some statements which appeared in earlier literature where it had been assumed the resulting gauge symmetry was @xmath227 for reasons we discussed above . as mentioned in the introduction",
    "one can show that the spectrum of various f - theory models , such as point - like instantons on a @xmath229 singularity , is anomaly free for @xmath103 but inevitably would have anomalies in some cases had the gauge algebra contained @xmath227 .",
    "note that the outer automorphism of @xmath230 which yields @xmath103 actually has order @xmath18 , since its square is conjugation by the matrix @xmath231 where @xmath100 is the @xmath101 identity matrix ; @xmath232 is not a central element of @xmath230 .",
    "this outer automorphism of course still induces the required reflection of the dynkin diagram , as we explained near the end of section [ s : lcy ] .",
    "this modifies the analysis which led to eq .   as follows",
    ". we let the outer automorphism of order @xmath18 act on @xmath148 and decompose into eigenspaces : @xmath233 each of which will be a representation of @xmath149 ( possibly reducible ) .",
    "as before , the eigenspaces for eigenvalues @xmath234 can be accounted for by certain positive roots which are left invariant under the involution and by certain pairs of positive roots which are exchanged under that involution .",
    "the moduli space for the former is @xmath80 and for the latter is @xmath81 ; when we consider the quantization of the d2-branes wrapped on the corresponding curves , we find @xmath235 half - hypermultiplets for each of the invariant roots , and @xmath236 half - hypermultiplets for each of the pairs .",
    "since each pair contributes to both the @xmath203 and @xmath152 eigenspace , this adds up to a total of @xmath235 half - hypermultiplets in the adjoint representation of @xmath149 , and @xmath237 half - hypermultiplets in the representation @xmath154 .",

    "we will show in a moment that the corresponding @xmath278 singularity can be smoothed to an @xmath279 singularity with @xmath6 monodromy .",
    "this corresponds to giving a nonzero vev to a semisimple element of the adjoint hypermultiplet , and the @xmath277 gauge group gets higgsed to some rank @xmath183 subgroup @xmath280 .",
    "we still have to determine what @xmath149 without knowledge of the @xmath281 that acquires a vev .",
    "clearly @xmath282 is possible , so we could have @xmath242 .",
    "we now argue that @xmath283 is impossible .",
    "there is no embedding of @xmath227 in @xmath277 for @xmath219 .    * proof * this argument is due to r.  zierau .",
    "suppose that there were an embedding of @xmath227 in @xmath277 .",
    "then the fundamental @xmath284 dimensional representation @xmath285 of @xmath277 would restrict to a representation of @xmath227 , which necessarily decomposes as a fundamental representation @xmath286 of @xmath227 plus a trivial representation .",
    "the alternating form on @xmath285 restricts to a alternating form on @xmath286 . since @xmath286 is odd dimensional , this form is degenerate .",
    "nullspace @xmath287 is invariant under @xmath227 , and is a proper subspace since the alternating form on @xmath286 is not identically zero .",
    "this is a contradiction .    the singular surface in question given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) may be written as @xmath288 and thought of as a double cover of the @xmath289-plane branched along @xmath290 and doubly along @xmath291 .",
    "it is the double branching that makes the surface singular .",
    "we may smooth the surface by deforming to @xmath292 now the double branching has been split to @xmath291 and @xmath293 . for a fixed value of @xmath179",
    "this process replaces a nodal rational curve by a smooth rational curve , where the nodal rational curve can be viewed as two rational curves intersecting transversely at a point .",
    "that is , each pair of intersecting lines in figure  [ fig : nd ] is replaced by a single line and the surface is smoothed .",
    "this smoothing process is remarkably benign at the level of global geometry .",
    "it is often possible to perform it even when the geometry of the ambient threefold , @xmath2 , is completely smooth at all times .",
    "we can then derive the @xmath103 gauge symmetry indirectly as follows .",
    "the existence of the deformation shows that @xmath1-branes are not allowed to wrap the individual lines of figure  [ fig : nd ] .",
    "the deformation converts each pair of lines into a single new line .",
    "thus if physics is not discontinuously affected by the deformation , the @xmath1-branes contributing to vector particles must only be allowed to wrap the pairs of line in figure  [ fig : nd ] together . as we have observed in the discussion immediately preceding the main assertion",
    ", we can now conclude that we do indeed obtain @xmath103.-branes around the individual lines is not compromised by this argument .",
    "when we deform the curve of @xmath279 singularities to a curve of @xmath181 singularities we may affect the geometry of some points on this curve .",
    "thus hypermultiplets which were `` spread '' over the whole curve of singularities may be localized to isolated rational curves by this deformation process .",
    "massless vectors can not come from such isolated curves . ]",
    "there is of course a problem with the proof of our main assertion by this argument  there may be global obstructions to such a deformation .",
    "wilson s criterion suggests that such deformations only occur when @xmath294 , where @xmath80 is the base of the fibration of figure  [ fig : nd ] as a ruled surface .",
    "we address this in part by giving an example of a deformation when @xmath294 .",
    "we return to the setup introduced at the end of section [ s : hyper ] . using the notation leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : su2kdef ] ) , we write the equation @xmath295 this gives @xmath170 with @xmath6 monodromy at the generic point of @xmath80 .",
    "the deformation is simply @xmath296    to make sense of this , we have to say a little more about the blowup .",
    "the @xmath279 blowups are determined by a procedure given in @xcite after choosing an ordering of the @xmath211 factors of @xmath297 .",
    "choosing the @xmath298 factor to be in the middle , we obtain the desired geometry .",
    "the last blowup creates a single ruled surface , which smooths out the singular component .",
    "it is immediate to see from the description in @xcite that for generic @xmath199 this is a smooth deformation of the desired type .    in this model ,",
    "we have placed a restriction on the genus and have introduced localized matter at the zeros of @xmath299 . however",
    ", if we are willing to accept that the process of gauge symmetry enhancement is dictated by local geometry then this example is enough to justify our main assertion .",
    "finally we close with a note on the peculiar numerical predictions dictated by anomaly cancellation in the six - dimensional physics produced by f - theory compactified on @xmath2 .",
    "this has been discussed in many places before ( for example @xcite ) and is often used as a method of enumerating the spectrum of hypermultiplets .",
    "here we have outlined a systematic way of constructing the hypermultiplet spectrum and so the anomaly constraint becomes a peculiar numerical property of the geometry of an elliptic  threefold .    for completeness we will repeat the anomaly condition here .",
    "we consider an elliptic fibration @xmath300 with a section .",
    "let @xmath301 be the gauge group ( or algebra ) in six dimensions and @xmath302 the picard number of @xmath9 . then anomaly cancellation along the lines of @xcite yields the following @xmath303 where the hypermultiplets fall into representations @xmath304 of @xmath301 and @xmath305 is equal to @xmath17 if the representation is real or @xmath306 if the representation is complex or quaternionic ( pseudoreal ) .",
    "note that the trivial representations also contribute to the sum .",
    "these can be determined from the fact that the number of neutral hypermultiplet moduli are equal to @xmath307 .    as an example consider the extreme case of @xmath308 corresponding to @xmath309 point - like @xmath250-instantons on a binary icosahedral quotient singularity in the heterotic string @xcite .",
    "the  threefold for the f - theory description of this has @xmath310 . applying the methods of sections [ s : hyper ] and [ ss : small ] to this threefold we also arrive at a spectrum of hypermultiplets of a @xmath311 for each of the @xmath312 copies of @xmath313 .",
    "these representations are quaternionic .",
    "equation ( [ eq : anom ] ) then reads @xmath314    the anomaly condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : anom ] ) has been verified in situations illustrating theorem [ ieven ] and our main assertion ( see the footnote in section 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "note that one may obtain further conditions from the anomaly cancellation condition .",
    "for example one may require the vanishing of coefficient of each `` @xmath315 '' term in the anomaly .",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "it would be very satisfying to give a purely geometric proof of eq .",
    "( [ eq : anom ] ) and the other anomaly conditions . ( a geometric proof which covers a wide variety of cases has recently been constructed @xcite . ) sadly at present the origin of this formula without using string theory is something of a mystery .",
    "note that the existence of a section in the fibration @xmath300 is necessary for this to work .",
    "if this requirement is not satisfied then there is no six - dimensional physics and the condition need not be satisfied @xcite ( for an example , see @xcite ) .",
