    "having an explicit group acting on a statistical model has numerous advantages .",
    "this was first pointed out by @xcite in the context of the location and scale models , which then led to the notion of a transformation family , that is , a  statistical model on which a group acts transitively .",

    "furthermore , @xmath31 contains elements coming from graph automorphisms of @xmath13 . specifically ,",
    "if @xmath32 \\to[m]$ ] is such an automorphism , then the permutation matrix @xmath33 with ones on the positions @xmath34 $ ] lies in @xmath31 , since its action on @xmath24 stabilizes the zero pattern prescribed by @xmath13 . for our running example @xmath35 , the permutation matrix @xmath36\\ ] ]",

    "now that we know explicitly which matrix group @xmath31 acts on our graphical model @xmath46 , we can use this group to develop classical notions of multivariate statistics in the general context of graphical models .",

    "let @xmath47 denote the @xmath48 matrix , whose columns correspond to @xmath49 independent copies of the vector @xmath19",
    ". then an equivariant estimator for the concentration matrix is a map @xmath50 , that is , a map from the space of @xmath49-samples @xmath47 to the parameter space of the model , that satisfies @xmath51 for all realisations @xmath52 of @xmath47 .",
    "the standard example is the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) .",
    "indeed , the likelihood of concentration matrix @xmath28 given an @xmath49-sample @xmath52 equals the likelihood of @xmath53 given @xmath54 , for any @xmath55 , and this implies that the mle is @xmath31-equivariant .",

    "the mle exists with probability one if and only if @xmath49 is at least the size of the maximal clique of the given graph .",
    "however , in general , whether the mle exists , with probability one , for a given sample size @xmath49 and a given graph @xmath13 is a subtle matter ; see the recent paper by @xcite and the references therein .",
    "by contrast , the question whether for a given sample size _ any _ equivariant estimator exists , turns out to have a remarkably elegant answer for any graph @xmath13 . to state it ,",

    "theorem  [ thgeqexist ] will be proved in section  [ secequivariance ] , where we also establish upper bounds on the robustness of equivariant estimators , based on general theory from @xcite .",
    "another classical notion related to a group action on a statistical model is that of _ invariants _ on the sample space . in our case , these are maps @xmath67 defined on @xmath68 , possibly outside some measure - zero set , that are constant on @xmath31-orbits , that is , that satisfy @xmath69 for all @xmath55 .",
    "an invariant @xmath67 is called _ maximal _ if it distinguishes all @xmath31-orbits . in formulas",
    "this means that for @xmath49-samples @xmath70 , outside some set of measure zero , the equality @xmath71 implies that there exists a @xmath55 such that @xmath72 .",
    "any invariant map is then a function of @xmath67 .",
    "the relevance of maximal invariants in statistics lies in the fact that they facilitate inference for the maximum likelihood estimator in the case of transformation families [ see @xcite ] . in this case",
    "the maximal invariant is an ancillary statistics that one may chose to condition on .",
    "these ideas can be used also in the case of composite transformation families , where the inference for the index parameter @xmath73 is based on the marginal distribution of the maximal invariant statistics [ @xcite , section  5 ] .",
    "another important application of the maximal invariant is in the construction of _ invariant tests _ [ see @xcite ] .",
    "suppose , for instance , that we want to test the hypothesis that the distribution of the multivariate gaussian random vector @xmath19 lies in @xmath46 against the alternative that it does not , and suppose that for the @xmath49-sample @xmath74 the test would accept the hypothesis .",
    "then , since @xmath46 is stable under the action of any @xmath55 , it is natural to require that our test also accepts the hypothesis on observing @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the test itself would have to be @xmath31-invariant .",
    "our result on maximal invariants uses the equivalence relation @xmath76 on @xmath0 $ ] defined by @xmath77 if and only if both @xmath78 and @xmath59 , that is , if and only if @xmath79 .",

    "the lower bound on @xmath49 in the theorem ensures that the @xmath85-matrices @xmath84 \\mathbf { x } [ { { \\hspace*{-1pt}\\downarrow\\hspace{-3pt}}}i]^t$ ] are invertible for generic @xmath52 , and in particular for @xmath86 outside a set of measure zero . for the complete graph , theorem  [ thmmmaxinv ] reduces to the known statement that @xmath87 is a maximal invariant , see example 6.2.3 in @xcite , while for our running example @xmath35 it says that the rank - one matrix @xmath88^t ( \\mathbf{x}[1 ] \\mathbf{x}[1]^t)^{-1 } \\mathbf{x}[1]$ ] ( recording only the direction of the first row of @xmath52 ) and the rank - two matrices @xmath89^t ( \\mathbf{x}[1,2 ] \\mathbf { x}[1,2]^t)^{-1 } \\mathbf{x}[1,2]$ ] and @xmath90^t ( \\mathbf{x}[1,3 ] \\mathbf{x}[1,3]^t)^{-1 } \\mathbf{x}[1,3]$ ] together form a maximal invariant for @xmath41 .",
    "we stress that theorem  [ thmmmaxinv ] gives a maximal invariant under the subgroup @xmath41 , rather than under all of @xmath31 .",
    "the proof of this theorem can be found in section  [ secorbequiv ] .",
    "our final results concern the space @xmath92 of @xmath31-orbits in @xmath91 .",

    "call the resulting graph @xmath94 ; it consists of red edges only .",
    "see figure  [ figorbitspacedim ] for an example .",
    "one can show that , up to isomorphism , @xmath94 is independent of the order in which the blue edges with incident vertices were removed  though in general it is larger than the graph obtained by deleting all blue edges , their vertices , and their incident edges at once .",
    "[ thmmorbitspacedim ] the dimension of @xmath92 equals the number of blue edges in the original graph @xmath13 minus the number of red edges in @xmath13 plus the number of remaining red edges in @xmath94 .",
    "in other words , that dimension equals the number of blue edges in @xmath13 minus the number of red edges deleted in the process going from @xmath13 to @xmath94 .",
    "this number is nonnegative : indeed , if in some step a blue edge @xmath95 is being deleted together with its vertices , then for each red edge @xmath96 being deleted along with @xmath39 there is also a blue edge @xmath97 being deleted , and for each red edge @xmath98 being deleted along with @xmath99 also a blue edge @xmath100 is deleted .",
    "this shows , in particular , that @xmath101 is zero if and only if @xmath13 has no blue edges , that is , if all edges run between vertices that are comparable in the pre - order .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition found in @xcite for @xmath46 to be a transformation family ; see theorem  [ thmmmassam ] below .    for our running example",
