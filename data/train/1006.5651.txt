    "when interband pairing is weak then the gaps on different sheets of the fs can have significantly different magnitudes .",

    "the effective masses estimated for the two deformed ellipsoidal fs sheets are larger than the predicted band masses and suggest a large electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath661 for these fs sheets . a much smaller value of @xmath67 was found for the third quasi - two - dimensional tubular fs sheet .",
    "these results suggest that the superconductivity in osb@xmath0 is driven by the two ellipsoidal fs sheets .",
