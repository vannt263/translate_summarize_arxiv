    "the theory of coloured versions of such foams is equivalent to a construction that was used by the authors to topologically model fusion of information and as a model for computation @xcite , and it is this that is our main motivation .",

    "the first is a broken surface diagram of the foam , the second is a broken surface diagram of tangled spheres and intervals , the third is a @xmath4dimensional analogue of a tangle diagram , the fourth is a tangle diagram , and the fifth is a gau diagram .",

    "some , such as underlying graph and underlying w - tangle , are structures which we obtain by suppressing some of the information in an inca foam . some , such as the fundamental quandle and the linking graph , are analogues of classical link invariants .",
