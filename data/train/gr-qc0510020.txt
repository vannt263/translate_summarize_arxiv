    "detailed and accurate models of binary neutron star coalescence phenomena , from quasi - equilibrium orbits through plunge and merger to the subsequent formation of the final compact object , will be required in order to extract information regarding the structure of neutron stars from detected gravitational wave signals .",
    "one detail of some debate over the past decade has been the so - called `` neutron star crushing effect '' , reported in  @xcite .",
    "this effect was first reported in  @xcite , where binary neutron star simulations employing a variety of simplifying assumptions indicated that as the binary stars spiraled inwards , the general relativistic gravitational interaction between the two stars caused a destabilization , triggering the collapse of each star to individual black holes well _ before _ the plunge and merger phase of the inspiral . since then",
    ", studies using several different sets of approximations  @xcite predict the exact opposite , namely that the gravitational interaction between the two stars act to stabilize each star as the binary separation decreases during inspiral . an error in the formulation used in the original `` neutron star crushing effect",
    "'' studies was pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "however , subsequent studies still claim a destabilization effect  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we report on the first fully dynamical general relativistic simulation results aimed at studying this `` neutron star crushing effect '' for inspiraling binary neutron stars . in the past several years",
    ", fully general multiple - orbit binary neutron star simulations have been performed in numerical relativity  @xcite .",
    "we use the evolution code previously described in  @xcite to perform multiple - orbit simulations of binary neutron stars ( for a detailed analysis of the accuracy of the simulations performed in this article , see  @xcite ) .",
    "we begin each simulation with initial data corresponding to quasi - equilibrium , circular orbit configurations modified such that the initial orbital angular velocity of the neutron stars is decreased by varying amounts .",
    "each initial data configuration satisfies the initial value constraints of general relativity .",
    "the simulations resulting from these eccentric - orbit initial data sets permit the study , within the context of full general relativity , of the compression / decompression effect by correlating the central rest mass density of the neutron stars with the proper separation of the stars as the evolution progresses through several apastron ( maximum separation ) / periastron ( minimum separation ) points during the inspiral .",
    "we find that the stars do , in fact , stabilize as the binary separation decreases .",
    "this result is the first fully dynamic general relativistic demonstration of the decompression of binary neutron stars ; the typical simplifying assumptions made in the treatment of the problem to date , such as the truncation of a post - newtonian expansion , the imposition of quasi - equilibrium conditions , or the forcing of the spin states of the evolution of the neutron stars ( e.g. , forcing corotation or irrotation during the inspiral ) , are _ not _ made in the analysis presented here .",
    "the numerical relativity / general relativistic hydrodynamics code used here is described in  @xcite and analyzed for accuracy in  @xcite . the grid size used for simulations",
    "is @xmath0 , employing a mirror symmetry about the equatorial plane of the neutron stars , @xmath1 .",
    "we choose units such that the gravitational constant @xmath2 and the speed of light @xmath3 are identically @xmath4 .",
    "a spatial discretization of @xmath5 is used , which corresponds to roughly 40 points across the diameter of each neutron star .",
    "the boundary of the domain is thus eight neutron star diameters away from the center of mass of the system .",
    "the physical parameters of three simulations ns-1 , ns-2 , and ns-3 are shown in table  [ tab : configs ] .",
    "the initial data corresponds to the quasi - equilibrium , corotating , circular orbit initial data described in  @xcite , except that here , the initial orbital angular velocity parameter @xmath6 has been decreased from the circular orbit value by a factor of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 for simulation ns-1 , ns-2 , and ns-3 , respectively .",
    "the resulting initial data satisfies the einstein equation initial value constraints , and results in binary evolutions whose orbits contain increasing amounts of eccentricity .",
    ".the physical parameters of the initial data used for numerical relativity simulations ns-1 , ns-2 , and ns-3 .",
    "these initial data sets correspond to quasi - equilibrium , corotating , circular orbit initial data with the initial angular velocity @xmath6 reduced from the circular orbit value by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the symbols @xmath10 and @xmath11 are used to denote the initial angular momentum and total rest mass of the configuration , respectively .",
    "the initial proper separation of the neutron stars , defined by eq .  57 in  @xcite ,",
    "is denoted as @xmath12 .",
    "a polytropic equation of state with adiabatic index @xmath13 is used .",
    "the rest mass of each neutron star corresponds to @xmath14 of the maximum stable tov rest mass configuration .",
    "all physical quantities in this article are expressed in units of @xmath15 , which we define to be twice the adm mass of a single stationary neutron star configuration with rest mass @xmath16 uniformly rotating with angular velocity @xmath6 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : configs ]    the initial spin state of each of the neutron stars corresponds to a corotation with the initial orbital angular velocity . for binary neutron stars of @xmath17 solar masses each , this corresponds to a spin period of approximately @xmath18 milliseconds .",
    "however , it is important to note that during the dynamical evolution , the spins of the neutron stars do not remain tidally locked to the orbital angular velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : circ ] ) .",
    "previous quasi - equilibrium sequence inspiral studies have assumed either strictly corotating or strictly irrotational neutron star spin scenarios ; in these cases , the spin states of the neutron stars are fixed to have either corotating spin or to be irrotational during the inspiral sequence . by numerically solving the general coupled einstein / hydrodynamics equations , we are able to study the more astrophysically relevant case where the non - zero spin of each neutron star actually evolves in time via the equations of motion .    [",
    "fig : circ ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : angmom ] , the angular momentum of the binary system simulations is plotted as a function of coordinate time ; @xmath19 corresponds to roughly two orbital periods . for comparison ,",
    "the angular momentum for solutions to the 2.5 post - newtonian ( dotted curves ) and 4.5 post - newtonian ( dashed curves ) point particle equations of motion is plotted along side the simulation results ( solid curves ) .",
    "the overall rate of decrease in angular momentum for the numerical relativity simulations is roughly equivalent , if not slightly more , than predicted by the post - newtonian equations of motion .",
    "however , the difference in total angular momentum between the numerical relativity simulations ns-1 , ns-2 , and ns-3 ( solid curves ) is nearly twice as large as the difference between the post - newtonian curves , even though the post - newtonian initial data is selected using the same method as in the numerical relativity case , namely , using circular orbit initial data with a decrease in initial angular velocity of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ( see table  [ tab : configs ] ) .",
    "this is most likely due to the nonlinear effects of resolving the constraints of general relativity after decreasing the initial angular velocity parameter @xmath6 when preparing the initial data for the numerical relativity simulations .",
    "[ fig : angmom ]    contour plots of the rest mass density for the initial data , as well as the first periastron points of simulations ns-1 , ns-2 , and ns-3 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhocontour ] .",
    "the first periastron points occur just slightly before the completion of three - quarters of an orbit for all three simulations .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : l_rho_vs_u ] , we plot the proper binary separation @xmath20 ( defined to be the spatial geodesic distance between the maximum rest mass density point of each neutron star , see eq .  57 in  @xcite ) as a function of the proper time @xmath21 measured by observers located at the maximum rest mass density points of the neutron stars .",
    "an evolved proper time of @xmath22 corresponds to roughly two orbital periods .",
    "also in fig .",
    "[ fig : l_rho_vs_u ] is a plot of the maximum rest mass density @xmath23 of the neutron stars as a function of proper time @xmath21 .",
    "oscillations in @xmath24 corresponding to the fundamental radial oscillation mode of each neutron star have been filtered out ( these oscillations have a proper period of @xmath25 ) .",
    "[ fig : l_rho_vs_u ] displays a clear correlation between the maximum rest mass density of the stars and the proper separation of the stars ; smaller proper separation @xmath20 corresponds to smaller maximum rest mass density @xmath23 .",
    "more quantitatively , the correlation @xmath26 between the proper binary separation and the maximum rest mass density is computed to be @xmath27 for all simulations .",
    "convergence tests on simulation ns-3 yields a richardson extrapolation value of @xmath28 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : convergence ] ) .",
    "[ fig : l_rho_vs_u ] also shows that the correlation between orbital separation and maximum rest mass density exists over gravitational radiation reaction timescales .",
    "this is evidenced by comparing both the proper separation of the binary and the maximum rest mass density at successive apastron ( local maximum in separation ) points in fig .",
    "[ fig : l_rho_vs_u ] .",
    "first , we see that the proper separation @xmath20 at the second apastron point ( which occurs at roughly @xmath29 for all three simulations ) is approximately @xmath30 smaller than the proper separation at the first apastron point ( which occurs at the initial time @xmath31 ) .",
    "gravitational radiation emission drains the binding energy of the binary , causing an overall decrease in separation from one apastron point to the next .",
    "we also see from fig .",
    "[ fig : l_rho_vs_u ] that the maximum rest mass density of the neutron stars is smaller at the second apastron point as compared to the first apastron point .",
    "thus , these simulations also demonstrate the correlation between orbital separation and maximum rest mass density on gravitational radiation reaction timescales .    in  @xcite , a post - newtonian matched asymptotic expansion technique is used to obtain an expression for the fractional change in the central density @xmath32 of inspiraling binary neutron stars , perturbative in powers of the `` tidal expansion parameter '' @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the stellar radius and @xmath35 is the binary separation , such that @xmath36 as @xmath37 . that is , when the fractional change in the central rest mass density of the stars is expanded about @xmath38 ( i.e. infinite binary separation ) in powers of @xmath39 , post - newtonian theory predicts the first non - zero term to be @xmath40 .",
    "we note that the limited range of binary separations , along with the large values of @xmath39 obtained in our simulations ( @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the proper stellar radius computed from the proper stellar volume @xmath43 according to @xmath44 ) , prevent us from accurately determining the power of the first non - zero term in an expansion of the fractional change in the central rest mass density as in , e.g. , eq .",
    "[ eq : alphascale ] . simulations involving much smaller values of @xmath39 ( larger binary separations , which imply longer orbital periods ) , which will only be capable with adaptive mesh refinement technology and/or higher order methods , will be required to verify the post - newtonian prediction eq .",
