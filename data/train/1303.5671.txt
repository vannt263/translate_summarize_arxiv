    "we , therefore , studied the acceptance dependence of @xmath7 by performing the analysis in different acceptance bins going from forward rapidity to mid - rapidity .",

    "it is however important to properly take into account trivial differences between a+a and p+p collisions e.g. , in the size of the colliding systems . in thermodynamics",
    "the quantities which are proportional to the volume of the system are called extensive quantities .",
    "for example , the mean number of particles in a relativistic gas within the grand canonical ensemble is an extensive quantity .",
    "the ratio of two extensive quantities does not depend on the system volume and is referred to as an intensive quantity .",
    "the studied fluctuation measure @xmath7 is even more complicated because it is inversely proportional to the system volume or to the number of wounded nucleons within the wounded nucleon model . on the other hand",
    "the scaled variance , @xmath12 , is an intensive quantity .",
    "it is therefore more intuitive to get a baseline from p+p interactions for the scaled variance .",
    "the scaled variance of multiplicity distributions , obtained via the _ identity method _ is presented in fig .",

    "these are the first released results on fluctuations of identified hadrons in p+p interactions .",
    "therefore , a semi - quantitative agreement with the predictions of the epos model is remarkable .",
    "more work is needed to interpret remaining differences between the data and the model .",
    "an additional complication in the experimental study of fluctuations in a+a collisions are unavoidable volume fluctuations from event to event .",
    "these additional sources of fluctuations may mask the fluctuations of interest .",
    "for example , the scaled variance is sensitive to the volume fluctuations .",
    "a set of so - called _ strongly intensive _ quantities , which within a grand canonical ensemble depend neither on the system volume nor on its fluctuations were proposed in ref  @xcite .",
    "the experimental study of these quantities is ongoing .",
    "we presented preliminary results from na61/shine on inclusive particle production in inelastic p+p collisions and discussed its future ion program .",
    "event - by - event fluctuations of particle ratios were analyzed using a novel approach , the _ identity method_. results on excitation functions of @xmath7 in central pb+pb collisions confirm an increasing trend towards lower energies , reported earlier by na49 .",
    "the detailed study of @xmath7 reveals a strong acceptance dependence at low energies for the @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "we conclude that the different energy dependence of @xmath7 measured by na49 and star ( bes program for central au+au collisions ) is due to the different phase space coverage .",
    "moreover , using the _ identity method _",
    ", the scaled variance of the multiplicity distributions of protons , kaons and pions were reconstructed in inelastic p+p collisions of na61/shine .",
