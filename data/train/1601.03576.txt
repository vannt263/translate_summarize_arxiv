    "the macroscopic chromoelectric field induces damped plasma oscillations and simultaneously creates gluons and quarks via the schwinger mechanism @xcite . in the following section ,",
    "we show how the longitudinal flux tubes dissipate into fluctuations and discuss the resulting spectrum of quarks and gluons .",

    "our initial conditions are transverse in momentum space , we choose to enforce this property also in our definition of the occupation number .",
    "due to the fact that the temporal - axial gauge condition @xmath105 is incomplete in the sense that it leaves a residual gauge invariance under time - independent gauge transformations @xcite , we may project onto the transverse degrees of freedom at any instant of time @xmath106 we emphasize that this condition will only be fulfilled locally in time but not globally in the sense of a coulomb - gauge condition .",

    "however , both plasma instabilities and the schwinger mechanism tend to isotropize an initially anisotropic system at later times .",
    "this raises the question of whether the system will become insensitive to details of the initial conditions , or may even exhibit universal properties during its time evolution .",

    "due to energy conservation , all the energy initially contained in the one - point function is then transferred to higher correlation functions .    a similar behavior is found upon adding a macroscopic initial chromoelectric field to the chromomagnetic field , corresponding to flux tube initial conditions . in fig .",

    "the electric field , on the other hand , directly produces quarks and gluons @xcite and subsequently accelerates them via the non - abelian lorentz force .",
    "we observe for both anisotropic scenarios ( nielsen - olesen - type , flux tube ) a depletion of the initially macroscopic fields .",

    "most notably , a power - law behavior in the intermediate momentum regime is found in both scenarios , suggesting the the late - time behavior becomes very similar .",
    "in fact , the value of the fermion power - law exponent is similar to the gluon exponent on similar time scales .",
    "a related phenomenon , where the quarks inherit approximate scaling properties of nonequilibrium bosons in an intermediate momentum regime , has been observed in a yukawa theory before  @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we studied @xmath120 degenerate light quark flavors in the weak coupling regime with @xmath156 . while the initial large gluon fields or occupancies are found to have a dramatic impact on quark production ,",
    "the backreaction of the quark sector on the gluon distribution has only the expected minor consequences at weak coupling .",
    "however , what controls this backreaction is the product of the coupling squared and the number of quark flavors such that for fixed @xmath157 of order one even the weak - coupling limit becomes strongly correlated for a large enough number of flavors .",
    "this opens the striking possibility to simulate strong - interaction aspects while staying within the range of validity of our real - time lattice simulation techniques .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the corresponding numerical simulations require substantially larger resources as the number @xmath60 of pairs of male and female spinor fields has to be significantly increased in this case . as a consequence ,",
    "we perform our numerical simulations on a somewhat smaller @xmath158 spatial lattice for @xmath159 as compared to the @xmath122 spatial lattice for @xmath160 . in the following ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to either gluon overpopulation or nielsen - olesen - type initial conditions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : energ_gluon_spectra ] we study how the quark backreaction influences the gluon quasi - particle energy distribution @xmath161 for different numbers of quark flavors and fixed @xmath156 .",
    "one observes that the peak gluon distribution is reduced for @xmath162 as compared to @xmath163 . however , most remarkably we find that the shape of the gluon distribution is almost unaltered .",
    "more precisely , the rescaling of both width and height by a common factor causes both curves to practically overlap as demonstrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : energ_gluon_spectra ] . as a consequence ,",
    "the universal properties of the gluon sector endure the impact of strong quark backreactions , at least at the level of accuracy considered .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : energ_quark_gluon_spectra ] , we show the quasi - particle energy distribution of quarks @xmath164 in contrast to the gluon distribution , whose peak is around @xmath165 , the dominant quark momenta have shifted to higher values .",
    "in contrast to gluons , which can be highly occupied , the quark occupancies are limited by the exclusion principle such that more and more states at higher momenta have to be filled to account for the increased energy in the quark sector as @xmath4 is enlarged .",
    "these findings resemble results for yukawa theories , where a similar separation of momenta was found  @xcite . apparently , increasing @xmath4 results in an efficient mechanism of transporting energy from the infrared to the ultraviolet , which should lead to a quickening of kinetic equilibration .    in order to achieve chemical equilibration",
    ", the total number of produced quarks @xmath153 needs to reach its thermal equilibrium value . in view of the limitations of the current methods to describe the long - time behavior ,",
    "we consider here a rough estimate of the chemical equilibration time based on an extrapolation of the quark production rate .    to this end",
    ", we perform a linear fit of the time - dependent particle number    @xmath166    the latter being presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : totnum_quark_fit_back ] . to estimate the chemical equilibration time",
    ", we seek the point at which agreement with the stefan - boltzmann limit of massless non - interacting quasi - particles @xmath167 with the riemann zeta - function @xmath168 , is obtained .",
    "in fact , the final temperature @xmath169 of the closed system can be determined from energy conservation . for gluon overpopulation initial conditions , for instance , equating the energy density in the stefan - boltzmann limit with the energy density of the initial state @xmath170 results in @xmath171    the corresponding estimate for the chemical equilibration time",
    "@xmath172 then gives @xmath173 and @xmath174 , respectively . without taking into account the backreaction of quarks onto gluons",
    ", one would expect the total quark production rates to be proportional to the number of degenerate flavors for fixed coupling .",
    "however , we find @xmath175 which points to the reduction of scattering rates by the diminished gluon occupation numbers for enhanced quark backreactions .",
    "we have studied gluon dynamics and quark production in two - color qcd with light quarks from simulations in @xmath2 dimensional space - time .",
    "we concentrated on the weak - coupling regime in order to guarantee the applicability of the classical - statistical approximation for the gluon sector , while we simulated the quark dynamics in a stochastic approach taking into account the quantum nature of the fermions . in order to understand the importance of fermion backreaction",
    ", we studied the dynamics for different @xmath4 by changing the number of quark flavors for fixed coupling .",
    "having considered three types of initial conditions with large fields or occupancies for @xmath176 , we confirmed the universality of the dynamics near the non - thermal fixed point existing in gluon systems .",
    "the scaling exponents we found in the gluon sector are in agreement with earlier investigations in pure yang - mills simulations .",
    "we demonstrated that anisotropic initial conditions leading to plasma instabilities and schwinger pair production in qcd isotropize rather quickly for the non - expanding system , such that their subsequent approach to thermal equilibrium via energy cascade to short length scales can be described in an entirely isotropic framework .",
    "the universality of the gluon dynamics has profound effects on quark production .",
    "although very different at early stages , the total numbers and spectral distributions of quarks produced from the different gluon initial conditions considered tend to approach each other at later times .",
    "the corresponding spectral distributions of quark particle numbers acquire a shape marked by a power - law at intermediate momenta in the weak - coupling regime for small @xmath4 .    while the initial large gluon fields or occupancies are found to have a dramatic impact on quark production , the backreaction of the quark sector on the gluon distribution has only minor consequences for small @xmath4 .",
    "we increased the number of flavors such that @xmath4 becomes of order one leading to a strongly correlated fermion sector .",
    "most remarkably , we find that the shape of the gluon distribution is almost unaltered by changing @xmath1 despite the fact that the peak gluon distribution can be reduced considerably . furthermore , for a strongly correlated fermion sector",
    "the dominant quark momenta have shifted to significantly larger values as compared to the characteristic gluon momentum of @xmath165 .",
    "our estimates for the chemical equilibration time indicate that calculations neglecting the backreaction for strongly correlated quarks lead to substantially shorter times than a full calculation taking into account the impact on the gluon sector .",
    "interestingly , a prolonged chemical equilibration could have a phenomenological significance by contributing to the elliptic flow of thermal photons  @xcite , a quantity which appears to be underestimated by hydrodynamic models  @xcite .",
    "in view of applications to heavy - ion collisions , taking @xmath4 of order one is expected to be a reasonable assumption and our results provide important insights into nonequilibrium qcd dynamics from first principles . the next step would be to include the longitudinal expansion of the plasma s space - time evolution .",
