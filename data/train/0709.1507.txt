    "this establishes a surgery equivalence for the knots that are `` taken along for the ride '' during the handle slides and are unchanged ( up to surgery equivalence ) by blow - ups .",
    "the final step is to show that if any three colored knots have bordant knot complements , then at least two of the colored knots must be surgery equivalent .",

    "then , in section [ sec : cuex ] , we compute some examples using the goeritz definition of the colored untying invariant and hence establishing the lower bound of @xmath3 for the number of surgery equivalence classes which was previously done using the seifert matrix . in section [ sec : bordisminvariants ] we show that every one of the colored knot surgery invariants give the same information and thus they are all computable given a diagram for the colored knot .",

    "if we let @xmath63 we see that the choice of a different basepoint results in an inner automorphism of the knot group and thus results in an inner automorphism of the dihedral group .",
    "so the definition is well - defined for any choice of basepoint .",
    "we will then ignore basepoints from now on and denote a coloring simply by a surjection @xmath64 from the knot group onto the dihedral group .",
    "two @xmath3-colored knots @xmath65 and @xmath66 are _ surgery equivalent in the kernel of @xmath2 _ ( or simply _ surgery equivalent _ ) if @xmath67 may be obtained from @xmath13 via a sequence of @xmath12-framed surgeries of @xmath10 along unknots in the kernel of @xmath68 .",

    ", the labeling must satisfy the _ coloring condition _ which requires that the sum of the labels of the underarcs must equal twice the label of the overarc modulo @xmath3 .",
