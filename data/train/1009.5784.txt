    "the recent surge of interest in quantum hamiltonians which are not hermitian but which nonetheless possess a completely real energy spectrum , due to an unbroken @xmath0 symmetry , stems from the pioneering paper of bender and boettcher@xcite , in which they showed , by numerical and asymptotic analysis , that the entire class of hamiltonians [ x^n ] h = p^2-(ix)^n had that property for @xmath2 . apart from the trivial case @xmath3 , the simplest example is for @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .    since that initial paper",
    ", there has been intensive investigation into the properties of hamiltonians of this kind , whose progress can be followed in the reviews by bender@xcite and mostafazadeh@xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to those features that form the essential background to the present paper .    for a viable framework of quantum mechanics one",
    "needs not only a real spectrum but also a probabilistic interpretation . in standard",
    "quantum mechanics that is provided by matrix elements of the type @xmath6 , orthogonality of eigenfunctions @xmath7 , and the probability density @xmath8 . in @xmath0-symmetric quantum mechanics it is found instead that orthogonality of eigenfunctions takes the nonlocal form @xmath9 , that is , @xmath10 . in the context of quantum mechanics",
    "this is a problem because the metric involved in the corresponding normalization integral @xmath11 is not positive - definite , and we do not in the first instance have a proper probabilistic interpretation .",
    "however , it was subsequently found@xcite that another metric could be constructed , with the help of a grading operator @xmath12 , which preserved orthogonality and gave a positive normalization integral @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast to standard quantum mechanics , this metric is not universal , but is dynamically determined by the particular hamiltonian in question .",
    "the calculation of this metric is usually extremely difficult , and in most cases can only be performed approximately , either through a set of algebraic relations@xcite , or through the use of moyal brackets@xcite .    a more general framework , of which @xmath14-symmetry is a special case ,",
    "was developed by mostafazadeh@xcite .",
    "a hamiltonian @xmath15 is said to be quasi - hermitian if it can be related to a hermitian hamiltonian @xmath16 by a similarity transformation : [ htoh ] h=^-1 h , where @xmath17 is a positive - definite hermitian operator . from this",
    "we immediately see that h^=h ^-1 , where @xmath18 .",
    "the connection with the @xmath14 formulation is that @xmath19 can be identified as @xmath20 when @xmath21 is written@xcite in the exponential form @xmath22 . accordingly",
    "@xmath17 can be written as @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding action of the similarity transformation on states is just [ simy ] |=e^q | , where @xmath24 is a state of the non - hermitian system governed by @xmath15 and @xmath25 is the corresponding state in the hermitian system governed by @xmath16 .",
    "then in the @xmath15 system the positive - definite metric given by @xmath19 corresponds to the standard quantum - mechanical metric in the @xmath16 system .",
    "thus , @xcite [ simmy ]",
    "_ 1 |e^-q|_2=_1 |e^-q(e^-qe^q)e^-q|_2=_1|_2 .",
    "a surprising recent development has been the application of these ideas to classical optics@xcite-@xcite . that such a transfer is possible is due to the fact that under certain approximations the equation of propagation of electromagnetic waves reduces to the paraxial wave equation , which has the same form as the schrdinger equation , but with different roles for the objects appearing there .",
    "the equation takes the form [ opteq ] i=-(+v(x ) ) , where now @xmath26 represents the envelope function of the amplitude of the electric field , where @xmath27 is a scaled propagation distance , and @xmath28 is the optical potential , proportional to the variation in the refractive index of the material through which the wave is passing .",
    "a complex @xmath29 corresponds to a complex refractive index , whose imaginary part represents either loss or gain . in principle",
    "the loss and gain regions can be carefully configured so that @xmath29 is @xmath0 symmetric , that is @xmath30 .",
    "there is also a non - linear version of this equation , arising from sufficiently intense beams , where there is an additional term proportional to @xmath31 .    among many recent papers we may mention linear@xcite and non - linear@xcite two - channel problems , and linear@xcite and non - linear@xcite optical lattices .",
    "@xcite , where , apart from an overall additive constant , the periodic optical potential was taken to be of the form @xmath32 , is of particular interest for the present paper , since it is a potential for which the equivalent hermitian hamiltonian can readily be constructed .",
    "figures of the propagation profiles have been given , both below and above the threshold for @xmath0-symmetry breaking at @xmath33 , showing unusual features , such as non - reciprocity , power oscillations and bifurcation . in what follows we attempt to cast light on these phenomena from the point of view of the equivalent hermitian system .",
    "for the potential used in ref .",
    "@xcite , the analogue schrdinger equation takes the form [ h ] --a ( + 2i v_0)= -for an eigenstate of @xmath15 , with eigenvalue @xmath34 and @xmath27-dependence @xmath35 . below the threshold for @xmath0-symmetry breaking , @xmath36 ,",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the potential can be combined into a cosine of complex argument , according to@xcite : + 2i v_0=(2x - i ) , where @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the non - hermitian hamiltonian [ hh ] h = p^2-a ( + 2i v_0 ) can be converted into the equivalent hermitian hamiltonian [ h ] h = p^2-a by the complex shift @xmath38 .",
    "this can be implemented by the similarity transformation of eq .",
    "( [ htoh ] ) , namely h = e^-qh  e^q with @xmath39 , which ensures that the spectra of the two hamiltonians are identical .    in the symmetry - broken case @xmath40 ,",
    "the corresponding identity is instead + 2i v_0=i(2x - i ) , where @xmath41 .",
    "however , in this case we have not gained a great deal from the similarity transformation , since the equivalent hamiltonian @xmath16 is itself non - hermitian .    finally , at the critical value @xmath33 , the equivalent potential vanishes altogether , so that the equivalent theory is simply a free theory , with spectrum @xmath42 , as has been noted by longhi@xcite , among others .",
    "part of this spectrum can be observed , in the reduced zone scheme in fig .",
    "1(b ) of ref .",
    "the transformation in this case is a singular one , with @xmath43 , so the methods used below can not be implemented for this limiting case .      in what follows",
    "we shall choose @xmath44 , the value taken in ref .",
    "then the analogue schrdinger equation for @xmath16 for @xmath36 is the mathieu equation@xcite : ",
    "+ ( a-2q)=0 , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in general terms",
    "the energy levels can be found by the floquet method , whereby we take two independent solutions @xmath47 and @xmath48 with the respective initial conditions @xmath49 and @xmath50 and integrate up to the brillouin zone boundary at @xmath51 to form the discriminant d()= ( u_1()+u_2 ( ) ) . if @xmath52 , there exists a periodic bloch - floquet solution of the form [ floquetsoln ] _",
    "k(x)&=&c_k u_1(x)+d_k u_2(x ) , satisfying _",
    "k _ k(x ) , where @xmath53 .",
    "this procedure gives @xmath54 as a function of @xmath34 , a relation that has to be inverted to give the band structure @xmath55 . in the standard notation for the mathieu equation",
    ", @xmath56 is called the characteristic exponent .",
    "the values of @xmath34 where @xmath54 is an integer @xmath57 , i.e at the brillouin zone boundaries , are termed characteristic values , and are of two types , @xmath58 or @xmath59 , depending on whether the bloch wave - function is even or odd .",
    "in fact in mathematica these functions have been extended to @xmath54 non - integral ( the functions mathieua and mathieub ) , effectively mapping out the whole band structure @xmath60 without the need to go through the floquet procedure explicitly . using this method",
    "we show in fig .  1 the band structure in both",
    "the reduced and extended zone schemes for the potential of eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , or eq .  ( [ h ] ) , for @xmath61 .    for @xmath62",
    "the analogue schrdinger equation for @xmath16 is  + ( a+i)=0 , which , by a shift of @xmath63 , again becomes the mathieu equation , but with @xmath64 pure imaginary .",
    "the functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 are still defined in mathematica , apart from some minor glitches , and can again be used to map out the band structure . in this case , the characteristic feature , first observed in @xcite , is that for real energies , which one is naturally led to consider in solid - state physics , the bands no longer extend to the brillouin - zone boundary , but fold back on themselves . in the optical context , however , complex values of @xmath67 are meaningful , corresponding simply to exponential growth or decay of the beam with @xmath27 . the band structure for @xmath68 , derived using the same method ,",
    "is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in the present case the floquet functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 are precisely the even and odd mathieu functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively , up to a normalization factor . for a given value of @xmath54 , we know @xmath67 and hence can determine the value of the ratio @xmath73 in the equation ( [ floquetsoln ] ) for the bloch wave - function .",
    "away from the brillouin zone boundaries neither @xmath74 nor @xmath75 vanishes , but precisely at those boundaries one or other is zero , making the solution purely symmetric or antisymmetric .",
    "thus , for example , at @xmath76 the wave - function corresponding to the lowest band is symmetric , whereas the wave - function corresponding to the next band is antisymmetric .",
    "the bloch wave - functions can be individually normalized in the extended zone scheme according to _",
    "0^|_k(x)|^2 dx=1 for @xmath77 the orthogonality arises from the different periodicities of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "if we use periodic boundary conditions in @xmath80 , so that @xmath81 , _ -n^n^*_k_r(x)_k_s(x )  dx = e^-i ( ) _ -^^*_k_r(x)_k_s(x )  dx , where @xmath82 .",
    "the second factor gives the orthogonality for @xmath83 , while the remaining integral gives the orthogonality at the bz boundaries .",
    "in quantum mechanics a standard method of implementing time development is the method of stationary states .",
    "that is , the initial wave - function @xmath84 is expanded as a superposition of orthonormalized energy eigenstates @xmath85 : ( x , t=0)=_i",
    "c_i _ i(x ) , with c_i=_i^*(x)(x , t=0 ) dx , and then ( x , t)=_i c_i _ i(x)e^-e_i t. in the optical problem exactly the same method can be applied , with @xmath27 taking over the role of @xmath86 , and the eigenstates being the bloch wave - functions .",
    "we first apply this method to the hermitian problem of eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) and then show how it can be adapted to give the @xmath27-development for eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) .      the initial envelope @xmath87 is to be expanded in terms of the @xmath88 , according to g(x)=_r c_r _ k_r(x ) , with the coefficients @xmath89 given by c_r=_-n^n ^*_k_r(x ) g(x ) dx using the translational property of the bloch wave - functions we can reduce the integration range to the standard cell @xmath90 to @xmath91 : c_r=_0^^*_k_r(x ) g(x ) dx  , where @xmath92 , and then @xmath93 is given by [ ssh ] ( x , z)=_r c_r _",
    "k_r(x)e^-ia(k_r ) .    for definiteness",
    "let us take @xmath94 to be a broad gaussian , @xmath95 , with @xmath96  , a function used in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite . in this case",
    "the absolute values of the coefficients are given in fig .",
    "3 , which reveals that they fall off rapidly with @xmath97 , and are essentially negligible for @xmath98 .",
    "they are concentrated around the even integers , reflecting the slowly - varying nature of @xmath99 .",
    "note that by convention the wave - function is taken to be @xmath100 at positive integers @xmath54 and @xmath101 at negative integers .    when the sum of eq .",
    "( [ ssh ] ) is performed , the development of the intensity , shown in fig .",
    "4 , shows no surprises : the beam , representing a gaussian wave - front at normal incidence , essentially propagates straight ahead , with a small amount of lateral spreading .",
    "the situation , however , is very different in the non - hermitian case .",
    "we now need to fit the initial gaussian @xmath94 to the transformed wave - functions @xmath102 rather than to the @xmath78 .",
    "that is , g(x)=_r d_r _ k_r(x ) . but from eq .",
    "( [ simy ] ) , which in terms of wave - functions reads @xmath103 , this can be recast as g(x+i)=_r d_r _",
    "k_r(x ) , and then @xmath104 .    in fact , for the parameters taken , the coefficients @xmath105 differ very little from the @xmath89 .",
    "however , because we are plotting @xmath106 rather than @xmath107 , the intensity pattern is very different , showing the characteristic birefringence and power oscillations first noted in ref .",
    "figure 5 is essentially identical to fig .",
    "2(a ) in that paper .",
    "it turns out that the asymmetry is primarily due to the contribution of the bloch functions with @xmath108 .",
    "we have shown that it is a simple matter to derive the band structure of non - hermitian sinusoidal potentials of the type occurring in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) using the equivalent hermitian hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) and the corresponding mathieu and related functions built in to mathematica .",
    "the dynamics ( z - development in optics ) can also be implemented using the method of stationary states .",
    "although in practical terms the z - development of the original equation is more efficiently found by direct numerical integration using the split operator method and fast fourier transform , it is hoped that the stationary state method helps to elucidate the difference between the hermitian and non - hermitian situations .",
    "in particular it turned out for the parameters we used that the expansion coefficients did not differ significantly in the two cases : the difference between figs .",
    "4 and 5 was overwhelmingly due to the fact that in the hermitian case one was plotting @xmath107 , whereas in the non - hermitian case the relevant function was instead the continuation @xmath109 .",
    "one may ask whether the birefringence shown in fig .  5 is a general feature of @xmath0-symmetric potentials , or whether there is something special about the sinusoidal potential .",
    "in particular , does the feature persist for a periodic square - well potential ( which in practice would be much easier to construct ) ?",
    "the answer seems to be in the negative , and the transition from the sinusoidal case to the square - well case can be neatly studied by using jacobi @xmath110 functions , whose @xmath111 parameter allows one to interpolate between the two cases .",
    "that is , we replace v = a(+2iv_0 ) with [ jacobi ] w = a , rescaling the argument so that the period remains @xmath91 . the imaginary part of the potential is shown in fig .  6 for the two cases @xmath112 and @xmath113 .    for @xmath114",
    "we reproduce fig .  5 , but by the time @xmath111 reaches 0.8 the birefringence is much less prominent ( see fig .  7 , upper panel ) , and for @xmath113 , at which point the potential is essentially a periodic square - well , it has more or less disappeared ( fig .",
    "7 , lower panel ) . since in intermediate cases",
    "the wave - functions are not well - known functions , these figures were produced using the original method of direct integration of the differential equation for the @xmath27-development .",
    "a few final remarks about the limiting case @xmath115 : for this particular value the eigenfunctions for the non - hermitian @xmath29 are again known functions , in fact modified bessel functions @xmath116 , so that one might hope that the stationary state method could here be used directly for the @xmath29 itself . however , as was pointed out by longhi@xcite , this is not possible because of spectral singularities , or the non - completeness of the bessel functions at the b - z boundaries @xmath117 integer .",
    "this is another manifestation of the singular nature of the similarity transformation between the non - hermitian and hermitian problem in this case .",
