    "lindelf alternative suggest that it is reasonable to look for a function @xmath333 for which operator @xmath332 admits large local sub - harmonics with the same or with a smaller order of magnitude as the keller  osserman bound near @xmath6 .    the asymptotic behavior given in suggests to use @xmath334 as a ` prototype ' family of sub and super - harmonics in order to determine the borderline potential @xmath335 . by direct computations we have @xmath336 where @xmath337 and @xmath338 .",
    "therefore @xmath339 where the expression in brackets is of lower order as @xmath54 .",
    "now we want to construct @xmath335 such that @xmath33 is , depending on the value of @xmath340 , either a sub or a super - harmonic .",
    "set @xmath341 for some @xmath342 .",
    "with such a choice of @xmath333 we find that @xmath343 in a small parallel strip @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , @xmath344 is a local super - harmonic of @xmath332 for all @xmath345 .",
    "otherwise , for @xmath346 , @xmath347 is a local sub - harmonic of @xmath332 .",
    "further , a simple computation verifies that @xmath348 is also a local super - harmonic of @xmath332 , for all @xmath349 .",
    "thus , a phragmen  lindelf type argument similar to the one used in theorem [ t - pl ] , applied here to @xmath347 and @xmath70 defined above , shows that if @xmath350 is a local sub - harmonic of @xmath332 then either @xmath351 or @xmath352 in particular , every large solution of must satisfy @xmath102 above .",
    "note that operator @xmath332 is positive definite on @xmath27 , simply because @xmath353 in @xmath27 . as a consequence , a comparison principle similar to lemma [ comp2 ] ( i ) is valid for equation .",
    "exactly the same arguments as in lemma [ ob1 ] imply that for large @xmath165 every solution @xmath26 of satisfies a keller  osserman type bound @xmath354 combining with the phragmen  lindelf bound @xmath102 which holds for any @xmath355 , we immediately obtain a nonexistence result .",
    "next observe that if @xmath357 then for @xmath358 the function @xmath359 is a local sub - solution of with infinite boundary values .",
    "this local sub - solution can be extended to a global sub - solution in the same way as in . however , contrary to the construction in proposition  [ lbound ] , this time we can not construct sub - solutions with everywhere finite and non - zero boundary values , cf .",
    "( i ) in the conclusion from the phragmen - lindelf argument above .",
    "recall that in theorem [ exist ] the existence was based on a family of sub - solutions with finite boundary values and a super - solution with infinite boundary value . since such sub - solutions are no longer available in the present case , we sketch a different argument for the proof of the above existence result . for @xmath36",
    "let @xmath365 be the large solution of @xmath366 the sequence @xmath365 is monotonically decreasing , and if @xmath367 is the sub - solution from extended to the whole of @xmath27 , then @xmath368 by the comparison principle .",
    "therefore @xmath369 as @xmath370 locally uniformly in @xmath27 , where @xmath26 is a large solution of in @xmath27 with @xmath371 .",
    "hence @xmath372 .",
    "together with the keller - osserman upper bound from this establishes the first claim of the theorem .",
    "we now proceed to the construction of the large solution @xmath363 .",
    "let @xmath362 be any given number and set @xmath373 then a straightforward computation yields for @xmath4 small @xmath374 since @xmath375 the expression in the parenthesis @xmath376 is of lower order as @xmath377 .",
    "let @xmath378 and choose @xmath379 such that @xmath380 .",
    "then for all @xmath5 with @xmath381 one finds @xmath382 provided @xmath383 is chosen sufficiently large .",
    "hence @xmath384 is a local sub - solution .",

    "lemma [ variational ] with @xmath124 replaced by @xmath386 ) .",
    "similarly to , one can choose @xmath383 large enough so that @xmath387 is a global sub - solution of in @xmath27 .",
    "to construct a super - solution , set @xmath388 which for large @xmath389 and @xmath4 small is a local super - solution .",
    "let @xmath165 be as in lemma [ osserman ] , so that @xmath200 is a global super - solution of in @xmath27 .",
    "then one can choose @xmath248 so large that @xmath390 is a global super - solution of in @xmath27 , which coincides with @xmath391 near the boundary .",
