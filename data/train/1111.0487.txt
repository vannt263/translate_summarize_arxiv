    "the reeb foliation is a codimension one smooth foliation of the @xmath3-sphere @xmath0 obtained by glueing two reeb components @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "since the one - sided holonomies of the reeb components along @xmath6 and @xmath7 are trivial , the reeb foliation is not analytic ( `` haefliger s remark '' ) .    on the other hand the @xmath8-jet space @xmath9 for a function of @xmath10 variables carries the canonical contact structure .",
    "it is contactomorphic to the unit sphere @xmath11 minus any point . here",
    "@xmath12 has the standard contact form @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 for coordinates @xmath16 of @xmath17 ) .",
    "thus we may regard a codimension-@xmath10 submanifold @xmath18 as a system of @xmath10 first - order partial differential equations ( for implicit functions ) .",
    "if @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the system is completely integrable and regular , and therefore defines a codimension one foliation @xmath21 on @xmath22 .",
    "the leaves of @xmath21 are legendrian submanifolds of @xmath12 corresponding to the solutions .    in this article",
    "we construct an embedding of @xmath0 into the standard @xmath2 so that the image has the reeb foliation @xmath21 by legendrian submanifolds .",
    "this example shows that even a non - taut foliation can be a family of legendrian submanifolds of @xmath23 .",
    "moreover we prove    [ main ] there exists a smooth family @xmath24 of codimension-@xmath25 submanifolds of @xmath2 such that    1 .",

    "@xmath28 is an embedded contact submanifold for @xmath29 , 3 .",
    "@xmath30 admits a reeb foliation by injectively immersed legendrian submanifolds of @xmath2 , and 4 .",
    "@xmath31 is an embedded overtwisted contact submanifold for @xmath32 .",
    "the foliated submanifold @xmath33 is obtained by joining two great circles @xmath34 through the legendrian torus @xmath35 .",
    "the family @xmath28 is obtained as a byproduct in the process of isotoping @xmath36 to the unknot .",
    "the author is seeking the converse approach , i.e. , to find a foliated submanifold by using contact topology or open - books ( see remark 1 in  2 ) .",
    "let @xmath37 be the natural projection of @xmath2 to the @xmath25-simplex @xmath38 , which sends the legendrian @xmath25-torus @xmath39 to the barycenter @xmath40 . the set @xmath41 contains the great circles @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the vertex @xmath44 .",
    "except them @xmath45 is a @xmath46-fibration . on the other hand , @xmath47 is a @xmath48-fibration .",
    "now we take the coordinates @xmath49 on @xmath50 by putting @xmath51 for @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath53 let @xmath54 be the standard @xmath55 .",
    "we deform @xmath54 with the help of a certain family of simple curves @xmath56 depicted in fig.[fig ] ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "note that @xmath58 has a break point @xmath40 while @xmath59 and @xmath60 are smooth on @xmath61 .     on @xmath50 and its parametrization by @xmath62,height=132 ]",
    "we generate @xmath63 by moving the intersection of the `` wall '' @xmath64 with the fibre @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "then we can see that @xmath28 realizes the join of two large circles @xmath67 and @xmath68 . now we give a precise definition of the curve @xmath69 .",
    "put @xmath70 for @xmath71 $ ] , and take a smooth function @xmath72 and a smooth odd function @xmath73 such that @xmath74 the inverse function @xmath75 of @xmath73 is defined on @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "it is smooth on @xmath61 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "we put @xmath78 , and take the curve @xmath79    next we show that @xmath28 is a smooth submanifold . by moving the @xmath25-torus @xmath80 for @xmath81 , we see that @xmath82 is diffeomorphic to @xmath83 .",
    "moreover @xmath28 is topologically the join @xmath84 .",
    "thus it only remains for us to examine the smoothness of @xmath28 along @xmath85 .",
    "we restrict ourself to the connected component of @xmath85 corresponding to @xmath86 and omit the other component .",
    "we put @xmath87 where @xmath88 $ ] is a parameter to be eliminated .",
    "then @xmath89 is a smooth disk since it tangents to the real @xmath25-plane @xmath90 at @xmath91 . since the function @xmath73 smoothly tangents to @xmath92 at @xmath91",
    ", @xmath28 is a smooth @xmath3-sphere .",
    "next we consider the ( non-)integrability of the restriction @xmath93 of the standard contact form @xmath94 .",
    "using @xmath95 as coordinates of @xmath96 , we can write @xmath97 here the sign of @xmath98 with respect to @xmath99 coincides with that of @xmath100 , and that of @xmath101 .",
    "more generally , if a submanifold @xmath102 is presented by a simple curve @xmath103 on @xmath104 , the nagative areal verocity @xmath105 still presents the non - integrability of @xmath106 . in the case",
    "where @xmath107 , the integrability means the vanishing of the areal verocity .",
    "that is why the curve @xmath58 is broken into two rays to / from the origin @xmath40 , and @xmath30 is non - analytic .    on the other hand , for cylindrical coordinates @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are written as @xmath111 this implies that the sign of @xmath98 everywhere coincides with that of @xmath101 .",
    "now we show that the foliation of @xmath33 is a reeb foliation .",
    "the definition of @xmath33 is @xmath112 where @xmath113 $ ] is a parameter to be eliminated . on the open solid torus @xmath114",
    ", we have @xmath115 thus the surface of @xmath116-revolution of the graph of @xmath117 is a leaf .",
    "similarly , we can describe the foliation on @xmath118 .",
    "these foliations spiral into @xmath119 and form a transversely oriented reeb foliation , to which the positive hopf link @xmath120 is positively transverse .",
    "finally we see from @xmath121 that the positive hopf band @xmath122 is a supporting open - book for @xmath29 . on the other hand ,",
    "the negative hopf band @xmath123 on @xmath124 is a supporting open - book for @xmath125 .",
    "thus @xmath31 is overtwisted .",
    "indeed it has the half - lutz tube @xmath126 .",
    "moreover , since we can reverse the orientation of @xmath0 by a diffeotopy , we obtain the following `` negative stabilization '' lemma .",
    "this ends the proof .",
    "the overtwisted contact submanifold @xmath127 is diffeotopic to the standard @xmath128 .",
    "particularly @xmath129 is differential topologically unknotted , but contact topologically knotted .",
    "any closed oriented @xmath3-manifold admits an open - book decomposition ( alexander @xcite ) .",
    "we can associate to it a contact structure ( thurston - winkelnkemper @xcite ) as well as a spinnable foliation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "further any contact structure is supported by an open - book decomposition ( giroux @xcite ) . using this result , the author constructed a certain immersion of any contact @xmath3-manifold into @xmath130 or @xmath2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this construction was generalized to any dimension , i.e. , @xmath131 or @xmath132 by martnez torres ( @xcite ) .",
    "the author proved that any / some contact structure of @xmath133 can be deformed into some / any spinnable foliation ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
