    "even an approximate calculation of these matrix elements is a very difficult problem for the available qcd methods , in particular , for the lattice qcd .",

    "various heavy - to - light hadronic form factors have been obtained by this method .",

    "a new lcsr technique is suggested to calculate hadronic matrix elements for two - body nonleptonic @xmath4 decays .",
    "the sum rule is obtained from the light - cone expansion of a three - point correlation function . as a study case",
    "we consider the @xmath16 channel .",
    "one of the main objectives of this work is to quantitatively assess the factorization approximation for @xmath0 .",
    "recently , the qcd factorization approach has been developed @xcite for two - body nonleptonic @xmath4 decays .",
    "it was shown that in the limit of the heavy @xmath17 quark mass the decay amplitudes can be treated in qcd using the framework of perturbative factorization for exclusive processes @xcite , with the heavy mass playing the same role as the large momentum transfer . in the limit @xmath18 ,",

    "the kinematical region should be carefully chosen , in order to stay far away from hadronic thresholds in both channels of @xmath32 and @xmath4 currents .",

    "we find that the hard and soft nonfactorizable corrections are of the same order and their overall effect varies within @xmath1932% of the factorizable amplitude .",
    "thus , in the @xmath16 channel both effects are very small and do not influence the decay amplitude , which is predominantly factorizable .",
    "the situation is different in the case of the @xmath194 combination relevant for the colour - suppressed @xmath195 decay : + + + = [ 0.103 ] + [ ( 0.03 - 0.04)-0.104i]+[0.021 0.064 ] . [ a2 ] here the nonfactorizable corrections have a noticeable impact on the amplitude , both on its magnitude and phase .",

    "adding to @xmath172 the remaining soft effects , due to annihilation and penguins , will most probably cause further changes in the decay amplitudes .",
    "one also has to stress that the soft and hard effects in eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) are calculated in different approaches .",
    "it is more safe and consistent to estimate all nonfactorizable effects using one and the same method , and the lcsr approach offers such a possibility .",
    "there have been several attempts to calculate nonleptonic decays of heavy mesons using ope and qcd sum rules @xcite and focusing on nonfactorizable matrix elements . an important prediction of this approach , as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , is the channel - dependence of nonfactorizable effects .",
    "however , certain complications manifested themselves in the derivation procedure of the sum rules .",
    "the original method @xcite of four - point correlation functions , applied to two - body @xmath22 decays , was plagued by a presence of light - hadron states in the dispersion relation for the heavy - meson channel .",
    "these states , as explained in sect .",
    "2 , originate due to the absence of an external momentum in the @xmath17-quark decay vertex . a different procedure suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath196 ( and used in ref .",
    "@xcite for other channels ) avoids this problem .",
    "if we apply the latter procedure to @xmath0 , the starting point is then a two - point hadronic matrix element @xmath197 .",
    "the expansion of the operator product in a series of local operators , t\\{j^()_5(x)o(0 ) } = _ k c_k(x)o^eff_k(0 ) , [ expan ] reduces @xmath198 to a set of simpler matrix elements , @xmath199 , which have to be calculated separately using , e.g. , qcd sum rules .",
    "only the lowest - dimension operator is usually taken into account for @xmath200 . matching the result of this calculation with the dispersion relation for @xmath198 in the channel of the current @xmath201 ,",
    "one finally obtains the two - pion matrix element @xmath202 .",
    "this estimate is rather ambiguous , because quark - hadron duality can not be applied to the hadronic matrix elements involved in this procedure .",
    "the method suggested in this paper avoids any unwanted contamination of the dispersion relation , due to the auxiliary external four - momentum in the @xmath17 -decay vertex . with this additional element , the sum rule for the hadronic matrix element",
    "is directly obtained from the initial three - point correlation function , as demonstrated in sect .  2 .",
    "one therefore does not need to follow the two - stage method of effective operators .",
    "apart from these essential improvements , there is also a very important difference between lcsr derived in this paper and sum rules obtained before . at all stages of the calculational procedure described in sect .",
    "2,3 we use the light - cone ope .",
    "in contrast , the sum rules obtained from four - point correlation functions @xcite are based on the short - distance expansion in local condensates . similarly , the method of effective operators @xcite employs a truncated short - distance expansion ( [ expan ] ) .",
    "this might be a reasonable approximation for a specific kinematics of @xmath196 considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the pion energy does not scale with the heavy mass ( see also a discussion on this point in the second paper of ref .",
    "however , as already emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , if the non - spectator hadron carries a large energy @xmath203 , as in @xmath0 , the resummation of local operators with the same twist is necessary .",
    "in fact , such a resummation is implicitly performed within the procedure of the light - cone ope employed in sect .",
    "it is instructive to demonstrate what happens if one employs a truncated short - distance expansion , instead of the light - cone one , in the correlation function ( [ corr ] ) .",
    "we consider again the diagram in fig .",
    "1b with the effective operator @xmath35 , and perform a short - distance expansion similar to the one in eq .",
    "( [ expan ] ) : id^4y  e^i(p - k)yt\\{j^()_5(y)_1(0 ) } = c_(p - k)|u(0)^^(0)b(0 ) , [ expan2 ] retaining only one local operator with the lowest dimension . to obtain the corresponding wilson coefficient @xmath204",
    "one simply has to put @xmath205 in the argument of the gluon field in the quark propagator ( [ prop ] ) .",
    "this local limit corresponds to the quark propagating in the static gluon field , a usual approximation for the condensates in the conventional qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "thus , in eq .",
    "( [ expan2 ] ) an infinite series of quark - gluon operators of the same twist containing derivatives of the gluon field is neglected .",
    "physically , this approximation , corresponding to a vanishing four - momentum of the soft gluon , can not be justified , because in the diagram of fig .",
    "1b the momentum of the on - shell gluon is in the range @xmath206 , where @xmath36 is of the order of the virtual quark momenta .    after substituting the expansion ( [ expan2 ] ) back in the correlation function ( [ corr ] )",
    ", we proceed using the light - cone expansion of the product @xmath207 and confining ourselves by the twist 3 contribution .",
    "the result is given by the same expression as in eq .",
    "( [ tw3f ] ) , but with @xmath208 in the denominator : ( f^(_1)_e , tw3 ) _ = _",
    "i   + ( q(p - k ) ) .",
    "[ tw3fsd ] we emphasize that in this modified procedure , the short - distance expansion has only been partially used .",
    "nevertheless , there are important changes in the resulting expression ( [ tw3fsd ] ) as compared with eq .",
    "( [ tw3f ] ) . the dependence of @xmath209 on the variable @xmath48 drops out , and the dependence on @xmath53 reduces to a simple factor @xmath210 , with an imaginary part proportional to @xmath211 .",
    "it is therefore difficult to attribute certain duality counterparts to the contributions of the pion and hadronic continuum , while matching the short - distance version of @xmath209 with the dispersion relation ( [ disp ] ) .",
    "let us , nevertheless , continue the derivation of the sum rule using eq .",
    "( [ tw3fsd ] ) and assuming a complete pion dominance in the dispersion relation . following the same procedure as described in sect .  2",

    "we have checked that a very similar result is obtained employing the two - step procedure @xcite based on the effective operators , if one uses the approximation ( [ expan2 ] ) for the expansion ( [ expan ] ) and calculates the @xmath21 matrix element of the effective operator separately , using the lcsr .    in the heavy quark limit ,",
    "evaluated using eq .",
    "( [ hqet ] ) , the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ asd ] ) is proportional to @xmath212 , enhanced by one power of @xmath151 in comparison with the twist-2 factorizable matrix element ( [ afacttw2 ] ) .",
    "note that the latter is obtained from the diagram in fig .",
    "1a containing free - quark propagators , and there is no difference between short - distance and light - cone expansions in this case .",
    "the situation closely resembles qcd sum rules for heavy - to - light form factors based on the local condensate expansion . in these sum rules ,",
    "the momenta of soft quarks and gluons forming vacuum condensates are also neglected yielding an enhancement of condensate terms at @xmath120 as compared with the leading - order perturbative terms ( for more details , see the discussion in ref .",
    "numerically , the nonfactorizable correction @xmath213 calculated from eq .  ( [ asd ] ) is almost an order of magnitude larger than the estimate ( [ lambdaenum ] ) and has a different sign .",
    "note that the sign difference in the nonfactorizable matrix element obtained using the new lcsr procedure is a consequence of the @xmath48 dependence in the correlation function and emerges after the analytic continuation @xmath214 .",
    "we conclude that even a limited use of the short - distance expansion in the correlation function ( [ corr ] ) yields a sum rule , where it is difficult to separate the ground - state contribution applying the usual duality approximation and where the higher - twist terms are enhanced at @xmath120 with respect to the leading twist-2 term .",
    "in this paper , a new method has been suggested to calculate the hadronic matrix elements relevant for two - body nonleptonic @xmath4 decays .",
    "the approach is based on the light - cone expansion of a three - point corelation function and on the analytic continuation from the spacelike to the timelike region .",
    "the resulting hadronic matrix element contains a factorizable part as well as soft and hard nonfactorizable corrections .",
    "all these contributions can be calculated within one framework using a common input .",
    "the nonfactorizable soft - gluon exchange correction calculated for the @xmath0 channel is our main result .",
    "importantly , the @xmath2 suppression of this effect has been explicitly reproduced , in agreement with the expectation of the qcd factorization approach .",
    "moreover , it is encouraging that the soft correction in @xmath215 turns out to be numerically small , suggesting that there are no unexpectedly large power corrections to qcd factorization in this channel .",
    "the accuracy of the lcsr method is limited , as usual in qcd sum rules , since one has to rely on the quark - hadron duality , both in the pion and @xmath4 channels .",
    "nevertheless , one may argue that the duality approximation works reasonably well having in mind , e.g. an agreement of the lcsr predictions for the @xmath21 form factors with the lattice qcd results .",
    "it is also important that uncertainties of the sum rule predictions can be assessed by varying the input parameters within the currently adopted limits .",
    "these parameters are universal , therefore , their accuracy can be improved in future by direct determinations on the lattice or by fitting qcd sum rules for experimentally measured hadronic characteristics to the data .",
    "the same method , with minor modifications , can be used for all other channels where @xmath4 meson decays either into two light hadrons , or into one charmed hadron ( or charmonium state ) and a light hadron .",
    "the important examples in the latter case are @xmath216 .",
    "the only limitation is that at least one of the light - quark hadrons in the final state has to be a pseudoscalar or vector meson , for which the light - cone distribution amplitudes are better known .",
