    "the reproduction of the extremely early moment after the big - bang is one of the biggest purposes and achievements in the present high energy physics .",
    "the experimental exploration is expected to be carried out by the groups at lhc and rhic , as well as many other groups including fair , j - parc , jlab and ribf .",
    "it will involve with the following basic problems : the novel matter phase of quark - gluon plasma , confinement of colors and quarks , chiral symmetry breaking and restoration , unstable nuclides , inner structure of hadrons and the force between hadrons , color glass condensation and superconductor . unlike the perturbative qcd which is well understood based on the property of asymptotic freedom of qcd@xcite , all the studies will lead us to understand deeply the properties of nonperturbative qcd as they all are relevant to the strongly coupled qcd .",
    "so far , the strongly coupled qcd is mainly described by the chiral dynamical models of qcd with dynamically spontaneous symmetry breaking@xcite , lattice qcd and holographic qcd ( or ads / qcd)@xcite .    the holographic qcd has been developed based on the ads / cft duality to characterize the strongly coupled qcd .",
    "ads / cft was initiated as the duality between the weakly coupled type iib supergravity on @xmath1 space - time and the strongly coupled @xmath2 @xmath3 super yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "it is known that @xmath2 @xmath3 super yang - mills theory has conformal symmetry and no field associated with fundamental representation .",
    "thus ads / cft itself can not correspond to the realistic qcd .",
    "the attempt for making ads / cft approach to the realistic qcd was first pursued in ref.@xcite , where the study has been paid to construct phenomenologically the model in searching for the bulk gravity matching with the realistic qcd .",
    "such kind of bottom - up approach is usually called as holographic qcd or ads / qcd models which include hard - wall ads / qcd model @xcite and soft - wall ads / qcd model @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to observe the correspondence between matrix elements obtained in ads / cft with the corresponding formula using the light - front representation as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite . it may distinguish from the top - down model resulted from solutions of string theories like d3/d7 @xcite , d4/d8/@xmath4 @xcite and d4/d6/@xmath5 @xcite .    in ads / qcd models , the cutoff is put artificially around the horizon in the radial coordinate of the bulk gravity .",
    "the location of such a cutoff corresponds to the inverse of qcd scale @xmath6 in the dual field theories . here",
    "the radial coordinate in the bulk corresponds to the energy scale in the dual field theories , thus the cutoff has a role as the ir cutoff in the dual field theories .",
    "there is a difference in how the cutoff is put between hard - wall and soft - wall ads / qcd model . in the hard - wall model ,",
    "the range of the radial coordinate is restricted sharply at the cutoff in the integration of lagrangian .",
    "whereas in the soft - wall model , the action begin to be suppressed gradually from around @xmath6 to the horizon by introducing the dilaton which is regarded as a background field .",
    "one of the main topics in the holographic ads / qcd is to consistently incorporate both the dynamics of chiral symmetry and the linear dependence of squared mass of mesons on spin and excitation number , namely the dynamically spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the linear confinement of qcd .",
    "the hard - wall model can succeed in the realization of the linear dependence on lower excited states and lower spins , while the linear dependence deviates at higher excited states or higher spins @xcite .",
    "the soft - wall model was motivated to improve this situation @xcite , so that the linear dependence was found to be satisfied for higher excited states and spins , but the resulting chiral condensation is proportional to quark mass , which is inconsistent with the realistic qcd . to further improve the situation ,",
    "a higher order quartic term was introduced in the potential of the bulk scalar field , which modified the proportional between chiral condensation and quark mass , but the bulk scalar potential field is not bounded @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in ref.@xcite that by simply modifying the bulk gravity at the infrared ( ir ) region in the soft - wall ads / qcd and keeping the conformal invariance to be unchanged at the uv region as required from the property of qcd , it enables us to build a predictive ads / qcd model which can provide a consistent prediction for the mass spectra of all light mesons . as a consequence , the mass spectra for both the groundstate mesons and resonance mesons can match well with the experimental data .",
    "another interesting topics in the holographic ads / qcd are to investigate the finite temperature effects . in ref.@xcite , in both of the hard- and soft - wall models , confinement / deconfinement transition temperatures were computed based on the evaluation of the free energies .",
    "ref.@xcite is a study of meson in the hard - wall model at finite temperature .",
    "the finite temperature effect on the spectrum of glueballs or mesons in the soft - wall model was studied in ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite , a holographic model for charmonium",
    "was built in the soft - wall model . in refs .",
    "@xcite , both mesons and gluons were investigated in the soft - wall model . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the spectral function was computed by taking the d3/d7 setup which is dual to @xmath3 super yang - mills theory with fundamental matters at finite baryon density . in ref.@xcite , the spectral function",
    "was computed holographically by modifying the d3/d7 setup with finite baryon density @xcite such that the dual field theory can have electric background . the setup with d4 and @xmath7-branes on @xmath8",
    "was considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "this is a non - critical string setup , which is considered not to have the problems originated from in critical string setups like @xmath9 .",
    "in such a circumstance , the spectral function was computed ( hydrodynamics was also performed ) .    in this paper",
    ", we are going to extend the predictive soft - wall ads / qcd model @xcite to a thermodynamic model at finite temperature .",
    "in particular , we will examine finite temperature effect on mass spectra of vector and axial - vector mesons from the computation of the spectral function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[chap : model ] , we include the finite temperature effect into the predictive soft - wall ads / qcd model in the usual way by simply considering a black hole metric . in sec.[chap : vm ] , we present a numerical computation for the spectral functions of the vector and axial - vector mesons at finite temperature .",
    "it is seen that the peaks of the spectral functions at low temperature will appear like a spike , the locations of the peak correspond to the groundstate mesons and resonances , which are found to match with the ones at zero temperature .",
    "we will show how the peaks dissolve as temperature increasing , which then indicates the chiral symmetry restoration . in sec.[chap",
    ": melt ] , we will qualitatively investigate the dissolution of the spectral functions by fitting to numerical results in terms of the breit - wigner form .",
    "the finite momentum effect in the spectral function is discussed in sec.[chap : md_fme ] . at the end of the section",
    ", we make remarks on the options in parameters and profiles for the high order scalar interactions as well as the boundary behavior of the scalar vev .",
    "our conclusions and remarks are given in sec.[chap : sum ] .",
    "some formula used in our computation of spectral function are derived and presented in[app : hsf ] .",
    "in this section , we will describe the extension of the predictive ads / qcd model @xcite to a thermodynamic model by simply considering the black hole metric @xcite .",
    "it then turns out that if taking the previous bulk vacuum expectation value ( bvev ) given in @xcite , the resulting dilaton background will diverge on the horizon at finite temperature due to the modified bulk geometry in the ir - region and the quartic term in the scalar potential , thus a modified bvev has to be introduced to avoid such a divergence in order to obtain a well - defined spectral function at finite temperature in the predictive soft - wall ads / qcd model .",
    "let us begin with considering the following black hole space - time as a bulk gravity : @xmath10 with the ir improved metric and the black hole metric @xmath11 here @xmath12 has the relation with a black hole radial coordinate @xmath13 via @xmath14 , it takes from @xmath15 ( inverse horizon ) to @xmath16 ( boundary ) .",
    "( in sec.[chap : vm ] , we will see that it is more convenient to use the variable @xmath17 . ) as the boundary theories are independent of the ads radius , we will set it as unity through this paper .",
    "the hawking temperature of the black hole is given as @xmath18 , which corresponds to the temperature in boundary theories .",
    "the mass scalae @xmath19 characterizes qcd confinement and is fixed by the low energy physics of hadrons@xcite .",
    "we take the black hole space - time as the bulk geometry , despite what the boundary theory is in confinement phase , as in the field theory the mesons are considered as the bound states of strong interaction . in our treatment , the bulk geometry of the black hole space - time given in eq .",
    "( [ metric_dads_01 ] ) is taken as the background .",
    "the dilaton is also taken as the background field , but it is obtained in the bulk geometry of the black hole space - time from solving the equation of motion for the scalar field with the required boundary conditions , the details can be seen below .",
    "thus , our system can be a solution of equation of motion in the end .",
    "( while it is not known whether it is stable or metastable .",
    "one way for the confirmation of that is via the evaluation of the specific heat like ref.@xcite . )",
    "this is the different point from other studies@xcite , where both of the dilaton and the black hole space - time are taken as the backgrounds for confinement phase . on the background geometry eq.([metric_dads_01 ] ) , the considered field ingredients include the dilaton background @xmath20 , the bulk scalar field @xmath21 and gauge fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 of @xmath24 gauge symmetry . here",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) the @xmath29 lie algebra are as the dual operators in the boundary theories .",
    "the model is given as follows on the background eq.([metric_dads_01 ] ) , @xmath30 where @xmath31 with @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 with @xmath35 is a gauge coupling given in @xcite .",
    "we use capital latin and greek character for the five dimensional and the four dimensional coordinates , respectively , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is the potential of the bulk scalar field .",
    "@xmath39 is a coefficient for the quartic term .",
    "here we will consider the case with or without the quartic term , i.e. , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath41 , its value at zero temperature was fitted from the meson mass spectra and found to be @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the bulk vacuum expectation value ( bvev ) of the scalar field and the dilaton background at finite temperature .",
    "taking the bvev to be a function of the fifth dimension @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes @xmath46 unit matrix .",
    "@xmath43 at zero temperature is given by table.[tbl01 ] , [ tbl02wo ] and [ tbl02w ] .",
    "here we refer it as zero temperature part and denote it as @xmath47 below .    .",
    "these are taken from @xcite .",
    "numerical values are given in table.[tbl02wo ] and [ tbl02w ] . [ cols=\"^,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     before closing this section , we would like to further make comments on the several options considered in this paper , which include : the value for the coupling of the quartic scalar interaction and the choices for the regularization parameters given in eq.([v1v ] ) , and the four types of models shown in table.[tbl01 ] .",
    "first , as for the coupling of the quartic scalar potential , as mentioned in the introduction , it was first introduced for obtaining a nontrivial solution of dilaton and meanwhile yielding the chiral symmetry breaking , while it was pointed out that the bulk scalar potential field is not bounded due to the opposite sigen@xcite .",
    "concerning the values assigned in this study , we have followed the analysis in ref.@xcite with changing the sign for the stability consideration and the nontrivial solution of dilaton is obtained as the consequence of the modified 5d metric at ir region with the introduction of the @xmath48 term , and the value of the coupling @xmath39 is taken from ref.@xcite by fitting to the experimental data . concerning the regularization parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 as shown above , we have assigned the values as small as possible in the numerical calculations , so that they do not affect our final conclusions . as for the four types of models discussed originally in ref.@xcite , which is to show how the predicted mass spectra rely on the ir boundary behaviors and the different forms with the same boundary behavior of the vev . as a consequence , it can be seen from ref.@xcite that the results are more sensitive to the boundary behaviors classified as a and b than the different forms named as i and ii in table.[tbl01 ] , the model iib leads to more consistent results with experiment data than other types of models .",
    "this is the reason why we take the model iib as the studying model in this paper .",
    "as we show in previous section how the peak dissolves as the temperature is increased to a critical point . here",
    "we are going to make a numerical study with fitting the spectral function by the following breit - wigner form : @xmath51 here @xmath52 and @xmath53 correspond to the location and width of the peak .",
    "@xmath54 represents the part not forming peaks and is taken to be the form @xmath55 .",
    "thus it involves eight fitting parameters : @xmath56 and @xmath57 . to see quantitatively the mass shift and the width change of the peak , we consider the lowest lying state and plot the relation between the mass shift @xmath58 and the width @xmath53 against the temperature . here",
    "@xmath59 is the predicted meson mass at zero temperature given in table.[vecm_nqt ] and [ vecm_qt ] .",
    "the result is shown in figs.[figmsiib ] and [ figmdtiib ] .",
    "it is seen from fig.[figmsiib ] that @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath53 as shown by the dotted line . from fig.[figiibht ] , it can explicitly be seen that the mass shift @xmath60 grows linearly as temperature increases and begins to deviate from the linearity near the temperature which leads the spectral function to dissolve .",
    "a similar phenomenology was also observed in ref.@xcite and considered to be consistent with the results based on qcd sum rule calculation@xcite .     and the width @xmath53 , which is obtained from the fitting to the numerical results of spectral function for the lowest lying state by the breit - wigner form given in eq.([fitfunc ] ) .",
    "the parameters used here are given in eq.([v1v ] ) and table.[tbl02wo ] and [ tbl02w ] , and the unit of temperature is in gev .",
    "the dotted lines with the linear behavior are plotted for a comparison .",

    "the other choices are the same as the ones in fig.[figmsiib ] .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]   and @xmath53 .",
    "the other choices are the same as the ones in fig.[figmsiib ] .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]    it is noticed that the relation between @xmath58 and @xmath53 is not known in the low temperature region where a peak appears as a spike .",
    "this is because there is no numerical results as in such a low temperature region , the peak stands like delta function , it is difficult to measure the width numerically . from fig.[figmdtiib ] , it is seen that the linearity occurs above certain temperature . in the low temperature region",
    ", such a linearity changes since the mass @xmath52 and width @xmath53 get values @xmath61 and @xmath62 at zero temperature , respectively .",
    "thus , it is expected that a similar change happens in the relation between @xmath58 and @xmath53 .",
    "in this section , we are going to study the finite momentum effect in the spectral function .",
    "such a momentum effect in the shape of spectral function was also studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "our results are shown in fig.[figiibfm ] .",
    "note that the spectral function in our present consideration is defined with a step function in eq.([eq : spectralv ] ) for a positive squared energy in the boundary theory from a general point of view@xcite .",

    "such a phenomenology is consistent with the observation in @xcite , but different from the results obtained by the perturvative analysis in a field theory@xcite , which may be considered as a peculiar and common behavior in strongly coupled field theories .",
    "let us turn to the effect of the step function defined in eq.([eq : spectralv ] ) .",
    "its effect appears as a wall in fig.[figiibfm ] .",
    "it is seen that there is a blow - up around the wall , and the hight of the wall is changed depending on fineness of step of @xmath64 taken in the numerical computation . as a result for the introduction of the step function , one may notice the difference in the speed of the wall moving as @xmath65 is increased .",
    "it may be seen from the differences between the left plot and the right plot in fig.[figiibfm ] with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , as well as with parameters given in table.[tbl02wo ] and [ tbl02w ] .",
    "in this paper , we have extended the predictive soft - wall ads / qcd model @xcite to a thermodynamic model by introducing a black hole metric .",
    "as the predictive ads / qcd model has adopted an ir - improved 5d metric to characterize the low energy dynamics of qcd @xcite , we have shown that it has to figure out a modified bulk vacuum expectation value and a modified coefficient of quartic term for the scalar field to get a non - singular dilaton solution . in obtaining the modified bulk vacuum expectation value and a modified coefficient of quartic term",
    ", an additional term is introduced to regulate the singular behavior .",
    "for that , the coefficients of the additional terms are taken to be small as much as possible in the practical calculations . with the smooth dilaton solution ,",
    "we have computed the spectral function for the vector and axial - vector mesons .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the peaks in the spectral function indicate the resonance mesons , as shown in figs.[fig_vec_nq ] , [ fig_av_nq ] and [ fig_va_qt ] . the location and",
    "the width of the peaks moves to a lower value of @xmath68 and becomes wider as the temperature increases , respectively , as seen in fig.[figiibht ] .",
    "we have found that the peak disappears completely at temperatures around @xmath69 mev , which implies the deconfinement of quark and the restoration of chiral symmetry breaking . to see how the peak dissolves quantitatively when the temperature is increasing to the critical point , we have made a numerical study by fitting the spectral function with taking the breit - wigner form .",
    "it has been seen that the mass shift @xmath70 with @xmath59 as the meson mass at zero temperature grows in a linear way as temperature increases .",
    "we have also investigated momentum effects and shown that the peak moves to a large @xmath64 direction .    * acknowledgement *    one of authors ( s.t . )",
