    "dwarf irregular galaxies have been supposed to be the simplest of gas - rich stellar systems .",
    "presumably complex milky way - size galaxies have accreted many of them as `` building blocks '' . since a significant part of this population",
    "was affected / consumed during mergers , finding samples of isolated and unperturbed dwarf irregular galaxies and studying their evolution through the hubble time is challenging .",
    "analysis of these pristine systems , which were likely built - up only via self - enrichment , could provide insight into the star formation history of `` building blocks '' .    leoa  an apparently isolated dwarf irregular galaxy in the local group",
    " could serve as an example of such a `` building block '' .",
    "it is an extremely gas - rich @xcite dark matter dominated stellar system @xcite of low stellar mass @xcite and metallicity @xcite .",
    "it consists of multiple stellar populations ranging from @xmath310myr to @xmath310gyr old ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the present - day star formation activity is traced by hii regions , while existence of old stellar population is proved by detection of rrlyr stars @xcite .",
    "studies of stellar content in leoa were performed with _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) wfpc2 @xcite and acs @xcite by imaging of the central part .",
    "however , photometric mapping to a comparable depth of the whole extent of galaxy s outskirts ( holmberg s dimension @xmath3@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) requires a wide - field imaging capability .",
    "the subaru telescope , equipped with suprime - cam mosaic camera , was ideally suited for this task and employed for our survey .",
    "structural analysis of leoa by @xcite , based on the same suprime - cam image set , has revealed a two - component disk / halo - like structure of the radial stellar surface - density profile and a sharp stellar edge of leoa .",
    "these findings are confirmed using the new photometry catalog , which is based on the improved reduction procedures .",
    "here we present the stellar photometry catalog and discuss suprime - cam data reductions .",
    "the following parameters of leoa , as derived from the red giant branch ( rgb ) star distribution by @xcite , are adopted in this study : ( 1 ) center coordinates of the galaxy , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( j2000 ) ; ( 2 ) ellipticity  ratio of semi - minor to semi - major axis , @xmath9 ; ( 3 ) position angle of the major axis , @xmath10 ; ( 4 ) size of leoa along the semi - major axis , @xmath11 .",
    "the foreground interstellar extinction towards leoa of @xmath12 , is derived from the extinction maps @xcite .",
    "the distance to leoa is assumed to be of 800kpc ( @xmath13pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "taking into account the angular size of leoa ( @xmath3@xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the subaru telescope , equipped with the prime focus camera ( suprime - cam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , was used to study the stellar content at the galaxy s very outskirts . a single - shot suprime - cam mosaic ( @xmath15 ccd chips ; @xmath16 each ) covers a field of @xmath17 ( scale @xmath18 ) , and magnitude of @xmath19mag is reached in 60s .",
    "we have observed leoa on two nights of november 2001 .",
    "images of leoa were acquired through @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath20 ( tagged as `` @xmath2 '' throughout ) johnson - cousins system passbands in clear sky and good seeing conditions ( full width at half maximum of stellar images , @xmath21 ) ; see table  1 for observation details .",
    "the analyzed field was centered at @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( j2000 ) , i.e. , slightly above the central part of leoa to keep the main body of galaxy around the middle of a single ccd ; see figure  1 for the stacked mosaic color image of the survey field .",
    "`` long '' and `` short '' exposures , consisting of five and three shots , respectively ( see table  1 ) , were used to ensure a wide dynamical range ( @xmath5mag ) of the final photometry catalog .",
    "the telescope was dithered between shots to avoid gaps midst ccds while mapping the field .",
    "the applied dithering pattern of `` long '' ( 5 shots ; @xmath24 , @xmath24 ; @xmath25 , @xmath26 ; @xmath27 , @xmath25 ; @xmath28 , @xmath27 ; @xmath26 , @xmath25 in @xmath29 & @xmath30 , respectively ) and `` short '' ( 3 shots ; @xmath24 , @xmath24 ; @xmath31 , @xmath32 ; @xmath33 , @xmath34 in @xmath29 & @xmath30 , respectively ) exposures assured an internal calibration of astrometry and photometry , relying on the same stars measured in adjacent ccd chips .",
    "the standard reduction procedures ( bias subtraction and flat - fielding ) were performed with the software package sdfred @xcite , dedicated to the suprime - cam data . for flat - fielding we used `` dark night sky '' flats , which were median combined from images of uncrowded sky regions of a m33 survey , conducted in parallel to leoa observations . from the analyses of the sky background across images we estimated the overall flat - fielding error to be of @xmath352% for the @xmath2 passband and smaller for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "note , however , that our internal photometric calibration procedure involved linear corrections of @xmath350.03mag photometric gradients at the edges of the mosaic derived from overlapping images , since `` dark night sky '' flats do not provide an exact representation of global sensitivity variation across wide - field ccd images ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , they remove small - scale variations well .",
    "the `` starl '' program @xcite was used to perform corrections of image defects , e.g. , `` blooming streaks '' of saturated stars , and produce a defect - free mosaic image shown in figure  1 .      for object cross - identification between different frames , exposures , and",
    "passbands their coordinates , ( @xmath36 ) , have to be transformed to a reference coordinate system , ( @xmath37 ) , of a surveyed field .",
    "therefore , we adopted the sdfred @xcite software package to create a reference mosaic image and to find transformation equations for each ccd frame to the reference coordinate system , ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the sdfred automatically corrected image distortions according to the prescription from the optical ray - tracing of suprime - cam and differential atmospheric refraction dependence on airmass @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath351.5pix ( 0.3 ) was achieved by this procedure between different passbands and exposures , but it was not suitable to cross - identify objects accurately enough for the photometric catalog .",
    "therefore , we stacked distortion - corrected images to make a reference @xmath1 passband mosaic with the pixel coordinate system , ( @xmath37 ) . using iraf s ` geomatch ` , we computed coordinate transformation equations , @xmath38 , for each image by interactively fitting a 5@xmath39-order polynomial to a sample of points distributed uniformly over an image , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "this procedure improved the accuracy of coordinate match between different passbands and exposures , leaving residuals of @xmath350.4pix ( 0.08 ) .",
    "the astrometric world coordinate system ( wcs ) solution of the reference @xmath1 passband mosaic was derived by cross - correlating a list of reference objects with the usno - b1.0 catalog of standard astrometric stars using iraf s ` ccmap ` .",
    "since the mosaic was transformed with the sdfred to the tangential sky projection , only linear terms were needed .",
    "the fitting procedure was performed by iteratively removing outliers and resulted in @xmath3150 uniformly distributed stars used to get an astrometric solution with r.m.s . of @xmath30.2 . finally , the pixel coordinate system of the reference mosaic , ( @xmath37 ) , was tied to the equatorial sky ( j2000 ) coordinate system , ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "due to variable point spread function ( psf ; fwhm changes up to @xmath325% across the suprime - cam field , especially at mosaic edges ) for analysis we used only six central ccds ( @xmath4 ) covering the whole extent of leoa ( see figure  1 ) . since corrections of geometric image distortions ( i.e. , re - sampling to a tangential sky projection ) and image stacking degrade the quality of psf",
    ", stellar photometry was performed on the original flat - fielded ccd frames .",
    "subsequently , aperture corrections , zero - point offsets , and residual gradients were applied via overlapping frames .",
    "we have performed stellar psf photometry on all individual `` long '' exposure frames by applying the daophot @xcite implemented in the iraf software package @xcite .",
    "we followed the photometry procedures described in the daophot documentation , however , in order to automate them and select stars for psf modeling , we used custom - built iraf cl scripts and external programs .",
    "the gaussian psf models as linear functions of image coordinates , ( @xmath36 ) , are based on reliable candidates of psf stars ( typical number @xmath330 ) , distributed uniformly across each ccd frame .",
    "the psf photometry was performed with iraf s ` allstar ` .",
    "the residual images were searched for new objects uncovered after subtraction of bright companions by setting a higher detection threshold of @xmath42 ( a detection threshold for the first iteration was set to @xmath43 ) to avoid spurious detections .",
    "newly found objects were appended to the initial object list and the ` allstar ` procedure was repeated .",
    "tests have shown that two ` allstar ` iterations were sufficient to detect stars even in the crowded central part of leoa .",
    "finally , neighbors of psf stars were removed from images by subtracting their best - fit models .",
    "we measured the `` total '' magnitudes , @xmath44 , of those psf stars using the @xmath45 radius apertures .",
    "these magnitudes were used as references to transform the `` allstar '' magnitudes , @xmath46 , to the `` total '' magnitude system of the image . due to psf variation across the image ,",
    "aperture corrections are linear functions of coordinates in ccd frames with typical r.m.s . of the fit @xmath350.005mag , assuring that `` allstar '' magnitudes of stars are reliably transformed to the `` total '' magnitude system of the mosaic .",
    "we note , that residual aperture corrections from @xmath44 to the true magnitudes , measured through large @xmath47 radius aperture , are constant for individual exposures on each ccd , and were taken into account as zero - point offsets .",
    "since the fields are relatively sparse and there are too few bright stars suitable for psf modeling in `` short '' exposure frames , the aperture photometry was performed , and bright objects appended to the psf photometry list .      since the exposure dithering scheme was used , the same object was measured in several individual frames , in some cases obtained with different ccds .",
    "this assured an accurate internal calibration of instrumental magnitudes over the survey field by using the same stars from overlapping frames .    for each passband",
    "we derived a global photometric solution of instrumental magnitudes over the whole survey field .",
    "photometry lists of objects measured in individual ccd frames were merged by positional coincidence adopting the maximum allowed coordinate difference of 2pix ( 0.4 ) .",
    "the final instrumental magnitudes were computed by taking median values of the zero - point corrected magnitudes measured in individual exposures .",
    "some stars in crowded regions were measured as `` double '' objects , i.e. , artificially split by daophot .",
    "those objects were analyzed interactively and considered to be single summing up their magnitudes , if distance between them was less than 1.5pix ( @xmath480.3 ) .",
    "the initial `` long '' exposure object list was produced in three steps : 1 ) all objects in each passband detected in 2 or more individual exposures were selected ( @xmath0  62,095 , @xmath1  52,794 , @xmath2 ",
    "57,533 objects ) ; 2 ) the object lists in three passbands were merged by positional coincidence adopting the maximum allowed coordinate difference of 2pix ( 0.4 ) ; 3 ) objects possessing @xmath1 and at least one of the @xmath0 or @xmath2 passband magnitudes were included in the object list .",
    "`` short '' exposure aperture photometry was transformed to the `` long '' exposure system by applying zero - point corrections .",
    "the bright ( @xmath49mag ) stars from `` short '' exposures ( saturated in `` long '' exposures ) were included in the final catalog .",
    "finally , based on visual inspection of color mosaic images , the object list was interactively cleaned from obvious background galaxies to produce the instrumental magnitude catalog , consisting of 38,856 objects .",
    "note , however , that instrumental magnitudes were derived neglecting differences in color equations of individual ccds , since the quantum efficiency curves of individual ccds @xcite differ only by @xmath50% and make these corrections negligible .      to transform instrumental magnitudes to the standard photometric system we used stellar photometry of leoa obtained by",
    "_ hst _ observations .",
    "the wfpc2 field observed by @xcite was imaged through the f439w , f555w , and f814w passband filters .",
    "this data set was measured applying psf photometry by @xcite and published on the `` _ hst _ local group stellar photometry archive '' , providing stellar magnitudes in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 passbands of the standard johnson - cousins system , suitable for suprime - cam calibration .",
    "the wfpc2 field is small ( @xmath3@xmath51 ) and overlaps only with one of six suprime - cam ccds used in our study .",
    "however , an accurate internal photometric calibration of individual suprime - cam ccds , having a maximum magnitude difference of @xmath350.02mag for bright stars ( @xmath52mag ) , enabled us to use local photometric standards @xcite to calibrate our instrumental magnitudes accross the entire field .",
    "we have selected accurately measured ( @xmath53mag ; @xmath54 ) isolated ( @xmath55 ) stars from the @xcite catalog and cross - identified them with reliably measured stars from our catalog , allowing a maximum coordinate miss - match of @xmath350.2 .",
    "this resulted in 161 photometric standard , spanning the @xmath1 magnitude range from @xmath320.0 to @xmath322.5mag and wide color ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) ranges from @xmath3@xmath58 to @xmath32.0mag .",

    "the following calibration equations were derived to transform instrumental magnitudes to the standard photometric system : @xmath60    figures  2(c ) & ( d ) show residuals of calibrated @xmath1 magnitude , @xmath61 , versus @xmath56 and @xmath57 colors , respectively",

    "although judging from figures  2(a ) & ( b ) , _ hst _ observations of leoa central field by @xcite have a comparable completeness limit to the suprime - cam data , we see a wider rgb in our data due to high field crowding .",
    "however , there is no strong crowding effect in the outer parts ( @xmath73 ) of the galaxy , where our survey was mainly targeted .    in order to estimate the completeness of the photometry catalogue in cases of various star densities more carefully , we performed artificial star tests ( asts ) , following prescriptions by @xcite within a rectangular test area of @xmath3@xmath74 in size , centered on leo a and extending beyond its limits @xcite .",
    "we computed completeness% , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the number of _ input _ and _ recovered _ artificial stars , respectively ] for 9 @xmath2 passband reference magnitudes , evenly distributed in the range of @xmath77mag . for every reference magnitude we produced two sets of ast frames .",
    "the original frames of individual exposures were populated with 8,000 ast stars , distributed on a regular grid with a step of @xmath37  ( i.e. , @xmath3@xmath78 to avoid self - crowding ) within the test area .",
    "the second set of ast frames was produced in the same way ; however , coordinates of 8,000 ast stars were shifted in @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions by @xmath33.5 .",
    "this resulted in a total number of 16,000 ast spatial sampling points per reference magnitude .    to measure ast frames we used the same object detection and photometry procedures as for the original leoa frames .",
    "for each of the 9 reference magnitudes photometric catalogs of all stars ( containing a fraction of ast stars ) detected in the ast test area were produced .",
    "we selected ast stars from these catalogs by matching their coordinates with the input ast star coordinates , allowing a maximum difference of 1.5pix ( 0.3 ) .",
    "based on the results of ast star photometry we estimated the completeness of the photometry catalog for three crowding cases : inside an ellipse of @xmath79  and within two elliptical rings of @xmath30.6  in width at @xmath80  and @xmath81  radial distances .",
    "completeness estimates as a function of the @xmath2 passband magnitude and radial distance from the galaxy center are shown in figure  5 .",
    "brightest ( @xmath82mag ) stars are confidently detected even in the crowded central part , however , at @xmath83mag completeness already varies from @xmath350% to @xmath385% depending on the radial distance from the galaxy center .",
    "since deep wide - field imaging became available , studies of dwarf galaxy structures have been a subject of great interest during the recent years ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "subaru suprime - cam has already been successfully used in analysis of other local group dwarf galaxies , e.g. , the transitional galaxy ddo210 @xcite , andromeda ii dsph @xcite , and ursa major i dsph @xcite , among others .",
    "we have performed a photometric survey of a field of @xmath4 size , covering the complete extent of an apparently isolated local group dwarf irregular galaxy leoa , with subaru suprime - cam in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 passbands . in this study",
    "we present : ( 1 ) the photometry catalog of 38,856 objects ( @xmath5mag ) , about 80% of which are classified as star - type ; ( 2 ) @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 passband `` finding charts '' ( stacked ccd mosaics ) , suitable for object identification , available via the www .",
    "this photometry data set of leoa has already been used to cross - identify sources in the _ spitzer _ study on census of asymptotic giant branch stars by @xcite .",
