    "the transition from this excited state to the ground state @xmath4 ) is predominantly magnetic dipole(m1 ) in character , but there is a small electric quadrupole(e2 ) component as well .",
    "the m1 and e2 transition rates depend on the inverse cubic and quintic powers of the transition wavelength respectively .",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath0 for @xmath5 must therefore be calculated by an accurate relativistic many - body method .",
    "indeed a comparision of the measured and calculated values of the lifetime for this state would constitute a stringent test of the theoretical approach on which the calculation is based .",
    "in addition , a precise knowledge of this lifetime is useful in determining the abundance of pb in the planetary nebula ngc 7027@xcite .",
    "the work in this paper uses the non - linear rcc theory to calculate this lifetime .",
    "this theory has been successfully applied earlier to different atomic systems@xcite , but it has seldom been used to study excited state properties for heavy atoms or ions . this is the first accurate calculation of the lifetime of the @xmath6 state of @xmath5 to our knowledge .",
    "we compare our rcc results for the excited energy and lifetime with those obtained from second order rmbpt(2 ) .",

    "the energy eigen values are scaled with respect to the rest mass energy of the electron .",
    "we first solve the relativistic hartree - fock(dirac - fock ) equations to obtain the single particle orbitals and their energies .",
    "@xmath33 the residual coulomb interaction is given by @xmath34 the single particle orbitals are obtained by solving the following equation self - consistently @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 the single particle relativistic orbitals can be expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the radial part of the large and small components respectively and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are their respective spin angular momentum components .",
    "@xmath43 s are the single particle energies .",
    "+ we have employed the rcc to incorporate correlation effects among electrons due to the residual coulomb interaction . in this approach",
    "the exact atomic wavefunction for the closed - shell system can be expressed as@xcite @xmath44 where t is the core electron excitation operator and @xmath45 is the above closed - shell determinantal state built out of the dirac - fock single particle orbitals .",

    "the normal ordered hamiltonian is defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "+ we have truncated our wavefunction expansion at the level of singles and doubles(ccsd ) and all possible non - linear terms have been included in the above equation .",
    "+ the ground state of @xmath5 contains only one valence electron ; namely the @xmath52 orbital .",
    "one way to evaluate the ground state energy of @xmath5 is to first compute the wavefunctions for the closed shell system @xmath53 using the above closed shell cc approach and then append a valence electron ( @xmath52 orbital ) using the open shell cc ( oscc ) method as follows . the same procedure has been followed to obtain the excited @xmath54 state .",
    "+ the new reference state of the open - shell system with one valence electron _ v _ can be expressed as@xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the particle creation operator .",
    "the exact atomic states are defined now , using the fock - space oscc method , as@xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the valence excitation operator .",
    "since the system under consideration has only one valence electron , the s- operator exponetial series naturaly truncates at linear term , i.e. the open - shell wavefunction has the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the cluster amplitudes corresponding to single and double excitations involving the valence electron .",
    "+ in the next step , we include approximate triple excitations by contracting the two - body operator(@xmath64 ) and the double excitation operators(@xmath65 ) in the following way@xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the orbital energy of the _ ith _",
    "note that we use notations a , b , c ... , p , q , ... and i , j , ... for the core , particle and generic orbitals respectively .",
    "+ the wavefunction in the framework of many - body perturbation theory(mbpt ) can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the @xmath70 order correction to the wavefunction @xmath45 .",
    "each order corrected wavefunction is a linear combination of all excited determinantal states with respect to @xmath45 .",
    "gathering excitations of the same order together from each of the corrected wavefunction we can rewrite the wavefunction of the many - body system as    @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the perturbation co - efficients for each order of the corrected wavefunction .",
    "the first index of the superscript represents the order of the pertubation and the second represents the excitation level .",
    "therefore , each t- operator accounts for the correlation effects from all orders of the perturbed wavefuction .",
    "the above relation shows that unlike in the mbpt , where the correction to correlation is computed order by order , in coupled - cluster theory once the leading correlation corrections are identified , a subset of terms to all orders which improve these corrections are also included .",
    "diagrammatic representation for this theory has been shown in the fig .",
