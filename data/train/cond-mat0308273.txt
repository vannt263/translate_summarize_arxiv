    "low - dimensional quantum spin systems , based on complex transition metal oxides , recently attracted a lot of attention , particularly as a fascinating playground to study spin - charge separation , spin - gap states and quantum disorder .",
    "proposals , that the exotic properties of low - dimensional spin-1/2 quantum magnets might also play a major role in shaping the mechanism for high temperature superconductivity , led to a vigorous experimental activity on materials involving @xmath4 ions with a 3d@xmath5 configuration ( s=1/2 ) .",
    "other examples of s=1/2 are notably @xmath6 and @xmath7 systems in d@xmath8 configuration ( i.e. , one single d - electron occupies one of the t@xmath9 orbitals ) . in this respect ,",
    "the layered @xmath10 ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) compounds are most promising and are candidates for exotic electronic configurations as in the resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) model @xcite and for superconductivity based on dimer fluctuations @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 has been first considered as a two - dimensional antiferromagnet , an electron analog to the high - temperature cuprates .",
    "this was based on considerations about the electronic properties and on the bi - layer structure of the compound formed by edge - sharing , distorted @xmath13 octahedra @xcite .",
    "high quality single crystals of @xmath0 display a kink in the spin susceptibility @xmath14 below about @xmath15=94 @xmath2 , followed by a pronounced drop at @xmath3=67 @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to a non - magnetic ground state at @xmath3 , therefore signaling the opening of a singlet - triplet spin - gap @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the effective dimensionality of the @xmath16 layers is reduced from two to one by an orbital ordering at @xmath6 sites and that the singlet ground state is reached by a phase transition also involving lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "consequently , the spin gap formation and the associated fluctuations in @xmath0 emerge in an entirely new perspective from a quantum antiferromagnet and a scenario based on a spin - peierls ( sp ) transition occurring below @xmath3 has been accredited as the most plausible interpretation of the experimental findings @xcite .    the title compound seems to be also an ideal material to investigate a broken symmetry ground state with orbital degrees of freedom but without charge ordering .",
    "the relevant role played by large electronic energy scales , associated to the orbital degrees of freedom , differentiates @xmath0 from @xmath17 and @xmath18 , two other intensively studied spin - peierls systems : @xmath17 being characterized by a state without orbital and charge degrees of freedom , @xmath18 with orbital and charge degrees of freedom @xcite . in this context",
    ", it is worth mentioning that the coupling of orbital to spin degrees of freedom in a chain system may establish a novel route to the formation of spin gap states and spin - orbital excitations @xcite .",
    "optical methods , like infrared or raman spectroscopy , are powerful experimental tools in revealing the characteristic energy scales associated to the development of broken symmetry ground states , driven by magnetic and/or structural phase transitions .",
    "indeed , information on the nature of the electronic ( magnetic ) ground state , lattice distortion and interplay of electronic ( magnetic ) and lattice degrees of freedom can be obtained studying in detail the electronic ( magnetic ) excitations and the phonon spectrum , as a function of temperature .",
    "furthermore , the role played by strong quantum fluctuations in s=1/2 systems , an issue of key importance , can be addressed as well .",
    "we provide here a complete set of infrared optical data on @xmath0 and a thorough analysis of its electrodynamic response .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we first briefly describe the experiment and present the data ; the discussion will then emphasize the temperature dependence of the phonon spectrum from where we extract relevant information about the spin - gap ground state below @xmath3 .",
    "our @xmath0 single crystals were synthesized by standard vapor - transport techniques from @xmath19 and @xmath20 , according to the procedure described in ref . .",
    "the crystals were checked by x - ray diffraction experiments and static magnetic susceptibility @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is an oxyhalogenide with layered structure formed of @xmath21 bi - layers , separated by @xmath22 bi - layers .",
    "the basic @xmath23 octahedra build an edge - shared network in the ab - plane of the orthorhombic unit cell .",

    "furthermore , the specific heat @xmath25 displays an anomaly only at @xmath15 ( ref . ) .",
    "we have measured the optical reflectivity @xmath26 from the far infrared ( fir ) up to the ultra - violet ( uv ) spectral range at temperatures between 10 and 300 @xmath2 and also as a function of magnetic field . since we did not find any magnetic field dependence , we will focus on the temperature dependence only .",
    "the kramers - kronig ( kk ) transformation of @xmath26 allows us to evaluate the optical functions , like the real part @xmath27 of the optical conductivity .",
    "further details pertaining to the experimental method can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "light was linearly polarized along the chain b - axis and the transverse a - axis @xcite . in order to avoid leakage effects of the polarizer",
    ", the polarization of light in our experiment always coincides with the vertical axis of the sample mounting so that the investigated crystallographic direction was perfectly parallel to the polarization of the light beam .",
    "therefore , the polarization dependence was obtained by rotating the sample ( instead of the polarizer ) by 90@xmath28 degrees inside the cryostat .",
    "this assures that no undesired projections of the light polarization along any transverse crystallographic direction occurs in our experiment .",
    "= 1    figure 1 summarizes our results , by focusing the attention on the temperature dependence of @xmath26 in the infrared spectral range and for both polarization directions .",
    "the insets display the whole @xmath26 spectra at 300 @xmath2 with a logarithmic energy scale .",
    "the first obvious observation is the strong anisotropy of the optical response within the ab - plane and for photon energies below @xmath29 . despite the two dimensional layered - like structure ,",
    "the anisotropy in the lattice dynamics may be considered as a signature for the low dimensionality of @xmath0 .",
    "figure 2 reproduces the real part @xmath27 of the optical conductivity at 300 @xmath2 in the far infrared spectral range , as obtained from the kk transformation of @xmath26 .",
    "the inset in panel ( b ) enhances the visible spectral range , stressing the feature around 8x10@xmath30 @xmath31 ( @xmath32 1 @xmath33 ) for both polarization directions . above 4x10@xmath34 @xmath31 the @xmath27 spectra",
    "( not shown here , see ref . for more details ) were found to be polarization independent .",
    "the high frequency part of the excitation spectrum @xcite is dominated by electronic interband transitions ( fig . 1 and inset fig . 2b ) .",
    "recent lda+u calculations @xcite , using the full - potential lmto method , predict a split - off of the ( one - dimensional ) t@xmath9 bands creating an insulating state with a ( charge ) gap of about @xmath35 ( 1 @xmath33 ) . the t@xmath9 band is derived from the d@xmath36 orbitals corresponding to the linear @xmath37-chains along the crystallographic b - axis @xcite .",
    "this agrees with our data displaying a peak at @xmath38x10@xmath39 along the chain b - axis and a pronounced shoulder at the same energy along the transverse a - axis ( see arrow in inset of fig .",
    "the same band structure calculations @xcite suggest furthermore interband transitions between the @xmath40 and @xmath41 p - levels and the @xmath37 d - levels at energies between 3.2x10@xmath34 and 5.6x10@xmath42 ( 4 and 7 @xmath33 ) .",
    "this is again very much in agreement with the absorption features seen in our @xmath27 spectra ( see insets of fig . 1 in ref .",
    ") along both polarization directions .",
    "= 1    in the far infrared spectral range ( main panels of fig .",

    "the absorption features are better seen in the real part @xmath27 of the optical conductivity ( fig .",
    "2 ) . on the one hand , along the chain b - axis ( fig .",
    "2b ) there is a strong peak at 294 @xmath31 with additional absorptions , overlapped to its low frequency tail , at 251 and 231 @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , we recognize broad absorptions at 177 @xmath31 and around 90 @xmath31 . along the transverse a - axis ( fig .",
    "2a ) on the other hand , there is a strong peak at 438 @xmath31 and less intensive absorptions at 68 , 104 , 294 , 347 and 387 @xmath31 , as well as a very broad feature around 200 @xmath31 .",
    "a few absorptions are furthermore characterized by an asymmetric shape ( see below ) .",
    "the strongest modes at 294 and 438 @xmath31 along the b- and a - axis , respectively , display rather broad high frequency tails , which might be indicative of some anharmonicity .",
    "for @xmath0 with the bisandwich layer structure of @xmath43-type @xcite , the space group @xmath44 can be considered at room temperature , for which two @xmath45 modes polarized along the a - axis , two @xmath46 along the b - axis and two @xmath47 along the c - axis can be predicted as infrared ( ir ) active phonons . because our samples are rather thin , we only have access to the @xmath46 and @xmath45 modes of the ab - plane .",
    "we note that 3@xmath48 , 3@xmath49 and 3@xmath50 raman active phonons are expected , as well . for light polarized within the ab - plane only the 3@xmath48 modes , inducing displacements along the c - axis ,",
    "can be detected @xcite .",
    "classical shell model calculations allow to extract eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors for both raman and ir - active phonons of @xmath0 ( ref . ) .",
    "as far as the ir phonons are concerned , the calculations predict the @xmath45 ( a - axis ) phonons at 91 and 431 @xmath31 and the @xmath46 ( b - axis ) at 198 and 333 @xmath31 .",
    "the agreement between the calculated phonon frequencies and the experimental observation is pretty good .",
    "particularly , the two high frequency ones can be identified with the most pronounced features in the experimental a- and b - axis spectra , respectively .",
    "figure 3 shows the normal mode eigenvector patters for the ir active phonons , resulting from our shell model calculations . table i summarizes the predicted and the so far experimentally determined phonon frequencies for the ir - active modes and , as complement , for the raman - active modes @xcite , as well .",

    "+ * *    even though the calculated frequencies of the ir phonon modes agree well with some features in our spectra , a larger number of phonon - like absorptions than theoretically predicted is found for both polarizations .",
    "the sample mounting chosen in our experiment ( see above ) allows us to exclude leakage effects due to the polarizer .",
    "however , one might invoke some twinning of the specimens .",
    "this could lead to additional phonon modes , due to the mixing of different polarization directions .",
    "this possibility is , nevertheless , rather unlikely because of the strong anisotropy of the optical spectra .",
    "if domains would be present because of twinning , phonons for both crystallographic axes would be detected for both polarizations of light and no anisotropy would be found .",
    "for instance the peaks at 387 and 438 @xmath31 along the a - axis ( fig .",
    "2a ) are totally absent in the spectra along the b - axis ( fig .",
    "the same applies for the sharp feature at about 104 @xmath31 for the a - axis .",
    "moreover as it will be discussed in details below , the temperature dependence in @xmath27 can differ substantially even for absorptions coinciding at the same frequency in both polarizations . therefore , we are confident that no common features are shared in fir among the two polarizations .",
    "we propose that the effective space group corresponds to a lower symmetry than assumed so far , or that additional surface modes may become ir - active .    in order to shed light on the temperature dependence of the phonon spectrum",
    "we have fitted the optical conductivity with the so - called fano expression @xcite : @xmath52 with @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the resonance frequency , @xmath55 is the width ( i.e. , damping ) and @xmath56 with @xmath57 as the oscillator strength and @xmath58 as the so - called asymmetry factor of the @xmath59-absorption .",
    "the asymmetric line shape for the ( sharp ) phonon modes derives from an interaction between lattice vibrations and a continuum , usually given by an electronic background .",
    "the interaction with a magnetic continuum may also lead to a fano lineshape , as shown in the raman scattering spectra of low dimensional spin systems @xcite .",
    "it is verified easily that for the dimension - less fano parameter @xmath60 one can recover the lineshape of the harmonic lorentzian oscillator @xcite .",

    "@xcite on the phonon interaction with a polaronic background in @xmath62 .",
    "this approach is based on the extension of fano s formalism by davis and feldkamp ( df ) @xcite , who considered the case of an interaction between an arbitrary number of discrete states and continua . in this work",
    ", we will primarily focus our attention on the fits of @xmath27 after eq .",
    "nevertheless , in order to stress the equivalence among different approaches , we will discuss and compare the relevant asymmetry @xmath58-factors obtained with eq .",
    "( 1 ) and by the df formalism .",
    "secondly , we also mention the discussion of the c - axis phonon modes in @xmath63 by schtzmann _",
    "_ @xcite . in this phenomenological approach ,",
    "the conventional lorentz shape was modified by a factor @xmath64 , where @xmath65 accounts for the asymmetry .",
    "this model , however , does not add relevant physical insight to the discussion with respect to the more simple lorentz model @xcite .",
    "therefore , it will not be considered further .",
    "the total fit of @xmath66 , covering the whole spectral range from fir up to uv , is obtained by summing over eleven and ten contributions in eq .",
    "( 1 ) for the a- and b - axis ( ref . ) , respectively . the fit of @xmath27 at 300 @xmath2 and the single components in fir for both polarization directions are shown in fig .",
    "the reproduction of the experimental @xmath27 curve is astonishingly good and the same fit quality is obtained at all temperatures . in passing , we also note that the same set of fit parameters @xcite allows us to reproduce the measured @xmath26 spectra ( see , e.g. , the fit of @xmath26 at 300 @xmath2 in the insets of fig .",
    "= .8    = .8    the temperature dependence of the fit parameters ( @xmath67 and @xmath58 ) @xcite is shown , as percentage change with respect to the 300 @xmath2 data ( e.g. , @xmath68 , with @xmath69 ) , in figs . 4 , 5 and 6 for both polarizations .",
    "along the a - axis the lower seven while along the b - axis the lower six oscillators are temperature dependent and will be here discussed further .",
    "the overall temperature dependence mainly develops below 200 @xmath2 and tends to saturate below 100 @xmath2 ( particularly for the chain b - axis ) .",
    "the temperature dependence , occurring in a broad temperature interval and extending well above @xmath3 , is indicative of an extended fluctuation regime , which has been recognized in nmr data @xcite , as well .",
    "the relaxation rates of @xmath70 sites show dynamic lattice distortion with onset at 200 @xmath2 while for the @xmath71 sites , @xmath72 , which probes the spin degrees of freedom , forms a maximum at about 135 @xmath2 ( ref . ) . therefore , the interplay between the lattice and spin degrees of freedom must be already taking place at high temperatures .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath72 implies a pseudo - gap phase in the homogeneous state of the spin system with an estimated pseudo - gap @xmath73 ( ref . ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the esr parameters ( i.e. , the esr line width @xmath74 and the so - called esr @xmath75-tensor ) also displays a progressive evolution over a broad temperature range between 200 @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( ref . ) . from the analysis of the esr signal",
    "it is claimed that a strong coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom exists and that spin as well as orbital fluctuation effects above @xmath3 may be responsible for the peculiar temperature dependence of various quantities ( e.g. , @xmath14 ) .",
    "the resonance frequencies ( @xmath54 ) of almost all phonons tend to increase ( fig . 4a and 5a )",
    ", though moderately ( i.e. , the change does not exceed 4 @xmath76 ) , with decreasing temperature , indicating a progressive hardening of the modes . the resonance at 320 @xmath31 along the b - axis , accounting for the broad high frequency tail of the mode at 294 @xmath31 , displays on the contrary a weak softening .",
    "a well - defined soft mode is in principal expected in models for the conventional sp transition where the structural deformation is driven by a linear coupling between the lattice and the magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "as far as the dynamical interplay between spins and phonons in @xmath0 is concerned , it is clear from the temperature dependence of our optical spectra that neither a soft mode nor a generalized red - shift in the resonance frequency of the phonons have been detected . at this point , apart from the 320 @xmath31 mode along the b - axis , we speculate that the transition at @xmath3 is not driven by a softening of the ir phonon spectrum",
    ". a final word on the soft mode issue will only be possible with neutron scattering experiments , since the lattice dimerization involved in the peierls transition is related to normal modes away from the brillouin zone center . from the perspective of the ir spectrum",
    ", one could have hoped that the presence of a soft mode would have resulted in an overall softening of the phonon - branch it belongs to .",
    "the absence of a clear signature for ir phonons softening is common to other spin - peierls systems , like @xmath17 ( ref . ) .",
    "nevertheless , evidence for phonon softening has been found in the raman scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "a broad feature was identified at about 160 @xmath31 for the chain b - axis polarization .",
    "the weight of this signal gets confined and softens down to 130 @xmath31 , i.e , by @xmath77 , with decreasing temperature .",
    "this mode is ascribed to a brillouin zone boundary phonon .",
    "the experimentally observed @xmath48 mode at 203 @xmath31 ( table i ) with light polarization along the b - axis is its related @xmath78-point raman - allowed phonon @xcite .",
    "most of the phonon modes get narrow with decreasing temperature ( fig . 4c and 5c ) .",
    "only the mode at 294 @xmath31 along the a - axis displays a broadening with decreasing temperature .",
    "particularly the width @xmath55 of quite all phonons along the chain b - axis follows very closely the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath14 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath55 in @xmath0 is very similar to the findings in @xmath61 ( refs . ) .",
    "the pronounced narrowing of the modes occur in the temperature interval of the so - called pseudo spin - gap phase identified in the nmr spectra @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore natural to relate this phonon narrowing with the suppression of low frequency spin fluctuations and to consider it as another fingerprint for the coupled spin - lattice fluctuations .",
    "= 1    it turns out that most of the absorptions , seen in our spectra ( fig . 1 and 2 ) and described by the @xmath59-components in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , reduce to the lorentzian - like ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) shape .",
    "only the peak at 104 @xmath31 along the a - axis and at 294 @xmath31 along the b - axis display a fano - like asymmetry .",
    "the asymmetry ( fig .",
    "6 ) of the mode at 104 @xmath31 along the a - axis gradually decreases ( i.e. , @xmath79 gets larger ) with decreasing temperature , although the mode remains considerably asymmetric at all temperatures .",
    "this indicates that there is a predominant interaction with the continuum both above and below @xmath3 . on the other hand",
    ", the temperature dependence of the asymmetry for the 294 @xmath31 mode along the b - axis displays a clear crossover between 200 @xmath2 and @xmath15 from an asymmetric fano - like shape ( i.e. , @xmath80 small ) to a lorentzian oscillator ( i.e. , @xmath79 very large ) .",
    "the distinct behaviour in the temperature dependence of the @xmath81-factors within the ab - plane is a further fingerprint for the anisotropy of the lattice dynamics as well as of the coupling between phonon and continuum .",
    "the clear fano - lorentz cross - over along the chain b - axis suggests moreover the suppression of the interaction with the continuum with decreasing temperature @xcite .",
    "this , combined with the anisotropic temperature dependence of the @xmath81-factors themselves , hints once more to a progressive dimensionality cross - over ( two - to - one ) within the ab - plane with decreasing temperature . since @xmath82 for both asymmetric modes , the relevant continuum of excitations , that is renormalized with temperature , covers an energy interval below the phonon resonance frequencies . for the chain b - axis ,",
    "this identifies a characteristic energy scale of the order of 400 @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "6 , we also report , for comparison , the @xmath58-factor for both modes as calculated from the fano model based on the approach of davis and feldkamp @xcite . even though the two fano approaches @xcite ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) and df ) are formally different ( i.e. , they are characterized by different energy powerlaw decays of the absorption coefficient ) , the corresponding @xmath58-factors are identical both in absolute value @xcite and in the relative percentage change ( fig .",
    "this stresses the equivalence of the fano asymmetry concept ( parameterized by the @xmath58-factors ) for both calculations .",
    "the temperature dependence of the spectral weight encountered in the phonon spectrum is also of interest .",
    "we have observed @xcite that the spectral weight encountered in @xmath27 at low frequencies tends to decrease below 200 @xmath2 .",
    "the total spectral weight , obtained by integrating @xmath27 up to the uv spectral range , however , is conserved and it is fully recovered already by @xmath83 ( @xmath32 1 @xmath33 ) @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by the behaviour of the squared ( @xmath84 ) oscillator strengths ( fig . 4b and 5b ) . particularly for the b - axis ,",
    "the spectral weight is progressively removed with decreasing temperature over a spectral range of roughly 400 @xmath2 .",
    "this is in agreement with the energy scale identified above in the analysis of the phonon asymmetry within the fano approach .",
    "most of the suppressed weight at low frequencies moves into the modes at 294 or 438 @xmath31 or into their high frequency tails along the b- and a - axis , respectively .",
    "the remaining part of the suppressed weight shifts from the elastic degrees of freedom towards zone boundary ( folded ) modes or , as we favor for @xmath0 , to the electronic degrees of freedom at high energies .",
    "again this overall shift mainly occurs between @xmath15 and 200 @xmath2 .    finally , the giant reduction of the phonon width , the behaviour of the fano @xmath58-factors ( particularly along the b - axis ) as well as the suppression of spectral weight in fir ( figs .",
    "4 , 5 and 6 ) suggest the presence and development of a characteristic energy scale . above all the depletion of spectral weight over an energy range of the order of 400",
    "@xmath2 is very much reminiscent of a similar behaviour in the raman spectra , occurring over the same energy interval with decreasing temperature and associated to the spin - gap opening @xcite . setting @xmath85 300 @xmath31 ( @xmath86 k )",
    "as lower bound for the spin - gap energy , we obtain a reduced gap ratio @xmath87 and 6.7 for @xmath15 and @xmath3 , respectively . with respect to the mean - field results",
    "( i.e. , @xmath88 3.52 ) our larger gap ratios might reveal competing exchange paths or electronic degrees of freedom @xcite , but are more reasonable than those obtained from recent nmr study @xcite .",
    "indeed , the extraordinary larger spin - gap @xmath89 would correspond to a reduced gap ratio ranging between 9 and 13 for @xmath3 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "one can reconcile the outcome of a typical local probe like nmr with the optical results , which notably give an average perspective of the excitation spectrum , by following the development of both the magnetic and structural correlations .",
    "with decreasing temperature down to @xmath15 the coherence length of the structural distortion increases and the magnetic correlations cross - over from 2d to 1d ( ref . ) . the energy gain at @xmath90 is mainly related to the spin system .",
    "therefore , the related anomaly in the specific heat @xcite is small and in conventional x - ray scattering no sign of a coherent structural distortion can be found @xcite . with further decreasing @xmath91",
    "the structural distortion becomes long range .",
    "below @xmath3 , @xmath0 has a conventional behaviour closely related to a spin - peierls system .",
    "therefore , the spin - gap @xmath92 ( from nmr @xcite ) is the lowest energy for the local double spin - flip in the short range order distorted phase , while @xmath93 ( from ir and raman @xcite ) is the energy for the global spin - gap of the fully dimerized chain .",
    "the phase transition of @xmath0 at @xmath3 is not of simple character and several features point towards an unconventional spin - gap formation . particularly intriguing",
    "is the temperature dependence of the phonon spectrum which , alike the nmr and esr spectra , and the magnetic susceptibility , hints towards the key role of both orbital and magnetic degrees of freedom in shaping the magnetic properties of @xmath0 .",
    "fluctuation effects , extending over a broad temperature range from @xmath3 up to 200 @xmath2 , seem to be the most peculiar property of this low - dimensional spin-1/2 quantum system and may be indicative of a novel coupling between low and high energy scales .",
