    "the ability to `` ride '' along a three - dimensional space curve and illustrate the properties of the curve , such as curvature and torsion , would be a great asset to mathematicians .",
    "the classic serret - frenet frame provides such ability , however the frenet - serret frame is not defined for all points along every curve .",
    "a new frame is needed for the kind of mathematical analysis that is typically done with computer graphics .",
    "the relatively parallel adapted frame or bishop frame could provide the desired means to ride along any given space curve @xcite .",
    "the bishop frame has many properties that make it ideal for mathematical research .",
    "another area of interested about the bishop frame is so - called normal development , or the graph of the twisting motion of bishop frame .",
    "this information along with the initial position and orientation of the bishop frame provide all of the information necessary to define the curve .",
    "the bishop frame may have applications in the area of biology and computer graphics .",
    "for example it may be possible to compute information about the shape of sequences of dna using a curve defined by the bishop frame .",
    "the bishop frame may also provide a new way to control virtual cameras in computer animations .",
    "in @xcite authors studied natural curvatures of bishop frame . in @xcite ,",
    "the same authors  considered slant helix according to bishop frame in euclidean @xmath4-space . in @xcite",
    ", authors researched the spinor formulations of curves according to bishop frames in @xmath1 .",
    "the notion of @xmath0-type submanifolds was introduced by arslan and west in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "many works related to curves of @xmath0-type have been done by several authors .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the authors gave curvature conditions and characterizations related to these curves in @xmath5 .",
    "in @xcite , authors considered curves and surfaces of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 or @xmath4)-type .",
    "they also give related examples of curves and surfaces satisfying @xmath0-type conditions . in @xcite , yoon studied curves of @xmath0-type in the lie group @xmath8 with a bi - invariant metric .",
    "also , he characterized general helices in terms of @xmath0-type curve in the lie group @xmath8 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section @xmath9 gives some basic concepts of the frenet  frame and bishop frame of a curve in @xmath10 section @xmath11 tells the curvature conditions and characterizations of @xmath0-type curve of osculating order @xmath12 in the final section we consider @xmath0-type curves and their curvatures @xmath2 , @xmath3 according to the bishop frame in euclidean space @xmath1 .",

    "the bishop frame or parallel transport frame is an alternative approach to defining a moving frame that is well - defined even when the curve has vanishing second derivative .",
    "one can express parallel transport of an orthonormal frame along a curve simply by parallel transporting each component of the frame .",
    "the tangent vector and any convenient arbitrary basis for the remainder of the frame are used .",
    "therefore , the bishop ( frame ) formulas are expressed as@xmath23 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } 0 & k_{1 } & k_{2 } \\\\",
