    "optical fiber conical tips with a sub - wavelength clear aperture at the apex are common tools in micro- and nano - optics .",
    "they are used for optical trapping of micro - particles in single - fiber - tip @xcite and counter - propagating two - fiber - tip @xcite configurations .",
    "fiber tips are also used in scanning optical microscopy : bare fiber tips can be applied for imaging of neurons @xcite , whereas metalized tips are the key element of nsom @xcite .",
    "the optical near field of metalized fiber tips was probed using fluorescent nanospheres and an analytical model for the emitted electric field was developed @xcite .",
    "the near - field intensity shows two lobes whereas the far - field emission is polarization dependent and of excellent gaussian shape with large emission angles exceeding 90@xmath0 in the p polarization @xcite .",
    "the emission angle can be directly linked to the tip apex size .",
    "these features have been essentially recovered by fdtd calculations @xcite . to some extent",
    ", a sub - wavelength aperture at the apex of a conical tip mimics a single small diffraction hole on a flat metallic screen , a problem that has been extensively studied @xcite since the pioneer work of bethe @xcite .",
    "recently the power propagation in apertureless metal - coated optical fiber tips was investigated theoretically @xcite and tip - to - tip scans of such fiber tips were studied in view of their applications to nsom lithography @xcite .",
    "two open aperture metalized fiber tips facing each other at distance of some hundred nanometers are a promising approach for optical nano - tweezers .",
    "they combine the advantages of nano - traps based on a plasmonic cavity @xcite with the flexibility of fiber based optical tweezers @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible to realize a genuine plasmonic tweezers , allowing not only nanoparticle trapping but also their manipulation at the nanoscale , with the rewarding prospect of possible operation in air , not only in a liquid .    in this paper",
    "we present the optical transmission and reflection study of metalized fiber tip pairs with tip distances in between tens of nanometers up to tens of microns , thus covering the optical near field and far field ranges .",
    "more specifically the transition between these two regimes is studied .",
    "such tip pairs are aimed at being used in future near - field optical tweezers .",
    "two different types of metalized fiber tips are studied : nsom tips and fib - cut tips .",
    "the first one consists of open aperture , aluminum - coated fiber tips currently used for nsom .",
    "the second one are gold - coated fiber tips , where the aperture is obtained by fib - cutting of the entirely metalized fiber tips .",
    "the main difference of these two tip types consists in the shape of the tip apex .",
    "the application of two different metals does not influence the results presented in this paper .",
    "the elaboration of both tip types is based on chemical wet - etching of single mode , pure silica core fibers ( nufern s630-hp ) @xcite .",
    "the obtained fiber tip angle is about @xmath1 . in the case of nsom tips , a magnesium fluoride ( mgf@xmath2 )",
    "film is first deposited on the as - etched tips in order to control the final apex diameter",
    ". then an opaque aluminum film of about 100 nm thickness is deposited by thermal evaporation after the deposition of a thin nickel - chromium adhesion layer .",
    "this technique allows to obtain apex diameters in the order of 200 - 300 nm without any further step such as fib - cutting ( fig .",

    "this point is of paramount importance for experiments with tip distances in the nanometer regime , thus justifying the more complex fabrication process compared to the nsom - tips .",
    "at the same time we start using gold for its capacity to support low loss surface plasmons .",
    "aiming smallest achievable aperture sizes , we dismiss the thick mgf@xmath2 layer .",
    "the 200 nm gold layer is deposited directly on the etched fiber tips , only using a 10 nm titanium adhesion layer .",
    "the fiber tip end is then cut by fib to get sub - micrometer tip apertures . with this technique",
    "the obtained tips are of elliptical or nearly circular shape , thus allowing to study shape effects .",
    "the transmission and reflection of optical fibers are measured on a dedicated set - up allowing scanning the relative fiber position with nanometer accuracy ( fig .",
    "[ fig.setup ] ) .",
    "one fiber is mounted on a set of @xmath3 piezoelectric translation stages ( pi p620 ) with sub - nanometer resolution and 50 @xmath4 m range .",
    "the second fiber is mounted on three perpendicular inertial piezoelectric translation stages ( mechonics ms  30 ) with @xmath5 nm step size and up to 2.5 cm range .",
    "a microscope with a long working distance objective ( mitutoyo m 50x ) coupled to a cmos camera allows to visualize the fiber tips with micrometer resolution .     +    for technical reasons we use two different diode lasers emitting at 808 nm and 830 nm to characterize the al- and au - coated fiber tips , respectively .",
    "the small wavelength difference has no influence on the results as the wavelengths are far away from metal absorption bands or fiber cut - off wavelengths .",
    "a 50/50 waveguide coupler is used to allow simultaneous reflection and transmission measurements by means of two amplified si - photodiodes ( new focus 2001-fc ) .",
    "a closed - loop control is implemented to stabilize the relative fiber tip distance at the nanometer scale .",
    "in fact , thermal drifts are a serious issue in a room temperature uncontrolled environment .",
    "the axial fiber tip distance is the most critical one as the transverse position can be calibrated by using the transmission maximum position .",
    "the feedback signal is obtained from a fabry - perrot cavity built by a cleaved optical fiber and a metallic mirror , respectively mounted on the two fiber tip holders ( fig .",
    "[ fig.setup ] ) . a fiber - coupled white lamp source and a mini - spectrometer ( avantes ) allow to measure the reflection spectra of the fabry - perrot cavity .",
    "its fourier transform directly gives the absolute cavity size .",
    "using the closed - loop control , the relative fiber tip distance can be controlled with a precision better than @xmath6 5 nm over more than five hours .",
    "the absolute tip distance is , however , more difficult to assess .",
    "the only accurate way is to perform transverse scans with decreasing distance until the tips are touching .",
    "this contact can be clearly observed on the microscope image or by the appearance of streaks in the transmission intensity plot .",
    "however , the fiber tip fragility may result in severe damage .",
    "after observation of a number of contact events , we estimate that the absolute distance can be determined from the microscope images with 50 - 100 nm precision . as a consequence ,",

    "intensity minima/ maxima are observed for :    @xmath27    with @xmath28 the wavelength and @xmath29 a positive integer .",
    "the circular fringes can be explained by back - reflection at the fiber tips .",

    "[ eq.fri ] by substituting @xmath9 with @xmath30 .",
    "the agreement with the experimental values is very good .",
    "the observed difference can be attributed to the real ( elliptical ) shape of the metalized fiber tips .",
    "the observation of distinct reflection patterns clearly shows that the emission pattern of the source fiber tip is influenced by the receiving fiber tip .",
    "the reflected intensity is about one order of magnitude smaller than the transmitted intensity .",
    "however , no fringe is visible on the transmission maps .",
    "now , two fib - cut fiber tips with different apex shapes are studied .",
    "the emission fiber tip is strongly elliptical with major and minor axis diameters of @xmath31 and @xmath32 nm , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig.sem].b , left side ) .",
    "the receiving tip has a nearly equilateral triangle shape with 260 nm side length .",
    "the measured transmission maps are elliptical for small tip distances and become circular for larger distances ( fig .",
    "[ fig.au ] ) .",
    "the elliptical transmission spots are described by two waists ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) measured parallel to the major axis @xmath35 and minor axis @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the as - measured minimal waists of the transmission spot are @xmath37 nm and @xmath38 nm .    the injected optical intensity inside the source fiber is 1 mw . the emitted intensity of the source fiber , measured by means of a power meter , is 1 @xmath4w .",
    "the transmitted maximal intensity is 1 nw and 0.48 nw for tip distances of 100 nm and 500 nm , respectively .",
    "the emission losses of 30 db are essentially due to strong propagation losses in the sub - wavelength wide section near the fiber tip end . for the measurement at @xmath39 nm , the reception losses are of the same order than the emission losses , suggesting that the propagation losses in between the two fiber tips can be neglected .",
    "the lower maximal transmitted intensity of the @xmath40 nm measurements scales with the inverse of the respective transmission spot surfaces .",

    "the maximal intensities are indicated for the experimental results.,title=\"fig:\",width=132,height=132 ]    in contrast to the nsom tip measurements , no reflection is observed for the fib - cut tips .",
    "this difference originates from the actual shape of the tip apex and not from the different metals used for tip coating . at 808 nm wavelength",
    "the gold and aluminum reflectance is @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively",
    ". the back - reflection of the gold coated fib - cut tips should thus even be slightly more intense than for the al - coated nsom tips .",
    "however , the nsom tips show an irregular surface with bended edges , whereas the surface of the fib - cut tips is flat with sharp edges . therefore , efficient reflection by the fib - cut tips would require very good parallel alignment of the fiber tips .",
    "moreover reflection could only occur for transverse distances below the actual tip apex size .",
    "the emission of the fib - cut fiber tips is calculated using a straightforward electromagnetic model .",
    "this model neglects the influence of the reception tip on the field distribution , but allows to reproduce the main experimental observations .",
    "the emitting fiber tip is approximated by an apex of elliptical shape .",
    "the optical intensity inside the apex is supposed to be uniform and is represented by a homogeneous distribution of ( typically @xmath43 ) coherent and orthogonal electric @xmath44 and magnetic @xmath45 dipole pairs calculated from the incident electromagnetic field ( @xmath46 ) :    @xmath47    with @xmath48 the normalized wavevector and @xmath49 the speed of light .",
    "the emitted electrical field of one single dipole pair is given by @xcite :    @xmath50\\left(\\dfrac{1}{r^3}-\\dfrac{ik}{r^2}\\right ) -\\dfrac{1}{z_0}\\left(\\hat{\\bold r}\\times\\bold m\\right)k^2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{r}-\\dfrac{1}{ikr^2}\\right)\\right\\}e^{i kr}\\ ] ]    with @xmath51 the vacuum permittivity , @xmath52 the free space impedance , @xmath53 the free space wavevector , and @xmath54 the distance vector from the dipole .",

    "the finite apex of the second tip results in an enlargement of the transmission spot and has to be taken into account . in the present case of two",
    "different fiber tips the size correction is less straightforward than for two identical tips .",
    "our results for the al - coated tips show , however , that the minimal waist is of the same order as the tip apex . for correction ,",
    "the triangular fiber tip is thus approximated by a circular tip of equal surface .",
    "consequently , the calculated emission intensity plots in fig .",
    "[ fig.au ] are convoluted by a two - dimensional gaussian function with a waist of 200 nm .",
    "the agreement of the experimental and theoretical transmission maps is satisfactory and the elliptical and nearly round shapes at respectively small and far distances are well reproduced .",
    "the corrected major and minor axis waists ( @xmath55 ) of the elliptical transmission spots are represented on fig .",
    "[ fig.ecc ] . here",
    "the experimental waists are corrected for the 200 nm apex size of the second fiber tip .",
    "the agreement of observed and calculated values is good for small tip distances and the main features are well reproduced .",
    "however , for larger tip distances the calculated values diverge from the experiment .",
    "this is mainly due to very low experimental signal levels and limits of the approximations concerning the simplified apex shapes .",
    "also , it would be interesting to quantify the influence on the field distribution of the receiving tip , which will require full electromagnetic calculations .",
    "this is left for future work .",
    "the minimal corrected emission waists of the elliptical fiber tip are @xmath56 nm and @xmath57 nm , slightly lower than the actual aperture of the elliptical fiber . at small distances light",
    "is transmitted by the optical near field .",
    "thus the shape of the two tip apexes determines the shape of the observed intensity spot . for larger distances",
    "the light is transmitted by the optical far field , which can not resolve the fiber tip shapes smaller than the diffraction limit .",
    "thus , the obtained image corresponds to a point - like optical emitter @xcite .",
    "this was experimentally observed by the decreasing difference between the major and minor axis waists .",
    "the numerical results even show an inversion of the ellipse major and minor axis at 365 nm , slightly below half the wavelength .",
    "in conclusion , the transmission and reflection properties of two kinds of metal - coated optical fiber tip pairs were experimentally studied .",
    "clear evidence of optical near - field coupling between the two tips of a pair was described by sub - wavelength transverse transmission spots .",
    "this point was confirmed by the resolution of the sub - wavelength fiber tip shape .",
