    "there is considerable evidence that protostellar collapse occurs from an interstellar envelope ( scale @xmath510@xmath6au ) onto , most likely , a circumstellar disc ( scale @xmath5100 au ) . for a long time",
    "the collapse is likely to be isothermal and at a low temperature ( about 10 k ) .",
    "this temperature is lower than the freeze - out temperatures of common interstellar molecules ( co 1517 k , nh@xmath7 5060 k , h@xmath4o 90 k ; see nakagawa 1980 ) , and , as collapse proceeds , the freeze - out timescale becomes shorter than the collapse timescale .",
    "the expectation is for a long isothermal phase at @xmath510 k when the molecules freeze - out onto grains followed by re - heating when they come off again .",
    "these processes have been modelled by , inter alia , nejad , williams & charnley ( 1990 ) , rawlings et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , bergin & langer ( 1997 ) and charnley ( 1997 ) .",
    "there is observational evidence for depletion in cores ( by about an order of magnitude ) in molecules such as co and cs ( e.g. bergin et al .",
    "2001 ; tafalla et al . 2002 ) .",
    "most of these results have come from observations of nearby molecular cloud cores in which low - mass stars are forming in small groups ( e.g. jorgensen , schier & van dishoeck 2002 ) . in the more distant orion region where our targets lie , ngc2024 ( in l1630 )",
    "contains several compact cores which show evidence for depletion of co and other molecules ( mauersberger et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the interpretation as depletion has been criticised , however , by chandler and carlstrom ( 1996 ) , who have provided evidence that some of the molecular gas is hot .",
    "their criticisms include : ( a ) the dust opacity law in the cores will be non - standard , ( b ) dust emission may become optically thick at the short submm wavelengths  giving an ` artificially low ' flux which is interpreted as a low temperature in an ` optically thin ' interpretation , and ( c ) the cores may contain unresolved components which are highly optically thick in molecular lines - but thin in submillimetre dust emission . thus the true molecular abundance may be much higher .",
    "mangum et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also provide evidence that the gas in the cores of ngc2024 is hot ( @xmath840 k ) which would accommodate a normal abundance for co.    one problem with ngc2024 , however , is that it is near strong external heat sources and hii emission and it is not clear that the line emission from the molecular gas arises from within the cores from which the dust emission emanates .",
    "in this paper we report new observations of carbon monoxide isotopomers c@xmath0o , c@xmath1o and @xmath2c@xmath0o from selected positions near and around cold cores in the same molecular cloud , l1630 .",
    "these positions have been chosen with reference to previously published maps of hco@xmath3 , c@xmath0o and dust continuum emission from the condensations lbs23 ( also known as hh2426 ) , lbs17 , and lbs18 ( e.g. gibb et al .",
    "1995 ; gibb & little 1998 , 2000 ; phillips , gibb & little 2001 .",
    "these references will be quoted as glhl , gl98 , gl00 , and pgl respectively ) .",
    "gl98 and gl00 deduced that there was depletion in several cores . the aim of this work is to confirm its significance and to evaluate its extent .",
    "we seek to determine optical depths from the co isotopomers and use the previously published dust emission data together with a range of possible emission laws to examine the relative abundance .    in sections 2 and 3",
    "we justify our need to observe isotopomers as rare as @xmath2c@xmath0o . in section 4",
    "we describe the observations , which we analyse in section 5 to deduce the depletion in and around the cores .",
    "the chemical significance of the results is outlined in section 6 .",
    "maps of two of the largest cores in the orion b molecular cloud , lbs17 and lbs23 , made in high excitation hco@xmath3 and c@xmath0o ( j=2@xmath91 ) lines , show striking differences between the structures traced by the two molecules .",
    "particularly apparent is the enhanced brightness of @xmath10=3@xmath92 hco@xmath11 relative to @xmath10=2@xmath91 c@xmath0o in the protostellar core lbs17-h ( fig . 2 of gl00 ) , and of @xmath10=4@xmath93 hco@xmath11 to @xmath10=2@xmath91 c@xmath0o in hh25mms ( fig . 1 of gl98 )",
    "1 , 2 and 3 show the relation between the c@xmath0o and dust emission .",
    "c@xmath0o emission is surprisingly weak in some of the clumps which stand out prominently in the other species .",
    "an interpretation assuming a simple source structure , optically thin c@xmath0o , and the dust emissivity law proposed by hildebrand ( 1983 ) , implies widespread reductions of the c@xmath0o abundance in these clumps by factors of 13 to 57 compared to what we take to be its canonical value of 2@xmath1210@xmath13 ( gl98 and frerking , langer & wilson 1982 ) .",
    "most of the clumps appear to be bound objects of several solar masses ( for lbs23 at least ) .",
    "gl98 consider other ideas to explain the apparent reduction in abundance for the clumps in lbs23 .",
    "abnormal dust properties do not appear to be required because dust - emission - derived masses for the clumps are in good agreement with their virial masses .",
    "another possibility is the absorption of c@xmath0o emission from intervening low excitation temperature gas .",
    "if this were the case then the effect would be seen as strong self - absorption in the optically thicker co lines .",
    "however , there is no evidence for such self - absorption in the co spectra ( gh93 ) . since the observed antenna temperatures measure the excitation temperature where the optical depth becomes equal to unity",
    ", a comparison of the co and c@xmath0o antenna temperatures would then suggest that the cloud cores are externally heated ( see e.g. gl98 ) .",
    "if the c@xmath0o emission arises in optically thick , unresolved sub - clumps the need for depletion might be avoided as all the c@xmath0o might not be detected .",
    "accordingly we have made careful observations of weak isotopomers , including c@xmath0o , c@xmath1o and @xmath2c@xmath0o , to seek to eliminate a sub - clump model . to illustrate how this can be achieved we consider a simple two - component model in the next section .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in section 5 of gl98 the authors describe a two - component model ( ` envelope ' and ` sub - clump ' ) where the envelope ( component 1 ) is optically thin ( depth @xmath14 , linewidth @xmath15 ) in the less abundant co isotopomers , such as c@xmath0o , and the sub - clump material ( component 2 ) is optically thick ( depth @xmath16 , linewidth @xmath17 ) in these same lines .",
    "extending their analysis it is also possible to define an _",
    "apparent _ depletion factor which describes how the presence of the optically thick clump mimics depletion within the beam in the simplistic interpretation as a single component .",
    "the co abundance for such a source would be proportional to @xmath18 + @xmath19 .",
    "however , in the standard optically thin analysis , not knowing @xmath20 , we would assume the co abundance is proportional to @xmath18 + @xmath21 .",
    "we will thus deduce co abundances that are too low by a ratio @xmath22 where @xmath23 is defined in gl98 as the ratio of the integrated intensities of components 1 and 2 .",
    "the optical depth of the sub - clump component @xmath20 in the denominator causes @xmath24 to be less than unity , and demonstrates how an optically thick sub - clump can mimic depletion .",
    "if we assume that the abundance is in fact normal then we can use our model along with estimates of @xmath25 and @xmath24 to deduce information concerning the nature of the sub - clumps .",
    "for example , the clump hh25mms ( glhl , gl98 and pgl ) stands out very prominently in dust continuum and 4@xmath93 hco@xmath3 emission but it is barely detectable as an independent source on the north - south ridge of 2@xmath91 c@xmath0o emission . the integrated intensity on the ridge is typically 2.5 kkms@xmath26 while hh25mms adds about 0.8 kkms@xmath26 to it .",
    "thus @xmath27 .",
    "also the apparent depletion factor , @xmath24 , is about 1/30 ( according to gl98 ) .",
    "hence , from equation [ eqna ] , @xmath28 = 120 .",
    "gl98 showed that the beam filling factor of the sub - clumps was given by @xmath29    the 4@xmath93 hco@xmath3 emission is closely correlated with the continuum dust emission , rather than the c@xmath0o , but has a linewidth similar to the c@xmath0o so @xmath30 . also for hh25mms",
    "@xmath31 0.2 so that the sub - clump filling factor is @xmath32 = 0.06 .",
    "these would be sub - clumps with a very high c@xmath0o optical depth and a very small beam filling factor in the 22 arcsec jcmt beam .",
    "we shall assume that the jcmt beam , of radius _ r _ , contains _",
    "n _ identical sub - clumps of radius _",
    "r_. then @xmath33 . we know @xmath34 since hh25mms is resolved .",
    "it follows that @xmath35 arcsec or 1000 au at the distance of l1630 ( 400 pc ) .",
    "since the apparent depletion is high , most of the mass within the beam at hh25mms is in the sub - clumps .",
    "glhl quote a mass of 8 m@xmath36 in the core of hh25mms .",
    "the sub - clump mass is then @xmath37 m@xmath36 and its density is greater than 2.5@xmath1210@xmath38 @xmath39 .",
    "the density of the envelope material is much lower .",
    "its mass is 1/30th that of the clumps , and taking the mass to be within a beamwidth gives a density 5@xmath1210@xmath6 @xmath39 . in summary , if we seek to retain normal abundances by assuming sub - clumping it would appear that the sub - clumps must have radii less than 1000 au and densities greater than 2.5@xmath1210@xmath38 @xmath39 .",
    "as described by gl98 , the most obvious problem with the ` sub - clump ' interpretation seems to lie in the fact that the hco@xmath3 intensity follows the submillimetre dust continuum emission well ( rather than the envelope observable in c@xmath0o ) yet its brightness temperature is so high that it must have a beam filling factor near unity , which is much greater than that deduced for the sub - clumps from c@xmath0o .",
    "nonetheless it is important to test the structure within the clumps either via interferometric observations or beam - matched observations of weaker co isotopomers .",
    "we may predict c@xmath1o line intensities , assuming @xmath40=120 .",
    "the component 1 intensity should decrease by a factor of 5.4 compared to c@xmath0o , since it is optically thin , but that from component 2 will be unaltered as its optical depth will still be extremely high ( = 120/5.4 ) . referring to table [ clumps ] ,",
    "the intensity will be @xmath41 so the ratio of the c@xmath0o to c@xmath1o intensities will be 2.6 .",
    "this might easily be misinterpreted as indicating that the c@xmath0o was just slightly optically thick .",
    "observations of even rarer isotopomers  so that the optically thin ` envelope ' contribution becomes negligible while the optically thick core component still remains  are required .",
    "table [ clumps ] gives predicted line intensities for the ` depletion ' and ` sub - clump ' models .",
    "it can be seen that observations of @xmath2c@xmath0o are clearly capable of distinguishing between them .",
    "observations of the j=2@xmath91 transitions of c@xmath0o , c@xmath1o and @xmath2c@xmath0o were carried out over the period of 1998 february 1628 at the james clerk maxwell telescope , using the common user sis receiver a2 ( davies et al .",
    "1992 ) and the digital autocorrelation spectrometer das .",
    "the original mixer in a2 had been replaced by one from nrao .",
    "the c@xmath1o observations were made assuming a rest frequency of 224.714 ghz , the c@xmath0o observations at 219.560 ghz and the @xmath2c@xmath0o observations 209.419 ghz .",

    "the positions of cores were observed , as well as a selection of references off core where there was sign of continuum emission .",
    "the pointing and antenna temperature were measured with reference to the nearby source omc1 .",
    "the pointing was consistent typically to within about 3 arcsec . on 16th and 17th",
    "february the apparent antenna temperatures of lines from the frequently observed calibrating source omc1 varied with time when observing the c@xmath0o and @xmath2c@xmath0o lines . the intensity of the c@xmath0o line varied systematically with time between 0.51 and 0.80 of that of the observatory reference spectrum for omc1 c@xmath0o , @xmath42 = 7.5 k. the c@xmath0o intensities we quote have been systematically corrected for this variation , which brought three of the observations into agreement with similar ones described by gl98 .",

    "the latter value is in good agreement with the solar expectation of 5.4 , suggesting that these positions are optically thin , and that the [ c@xmath1o]/[c@xmath0o ] ratio is normal .",
    "the former suggests that c@xmath0o may be slightly optically thick in the cores , but certainly not sufficiently to discredit a former conclusion that co is depleted in several of the cores of lbs23 ( gl98 ) .",

    "the depletion factor is @xmath520 , in good agreement with the levels of co depletion we derived above .",

    "we are currently analysing observations of hco@xmath3 and dco@xmath3 isotopomers on the cores to study this phenomenon more carefully .    since star - formation has already taken place in l1630 ( e.g. lada et al . 1991 ) the initial conditions for the chemistry will not be pristine .",

    "it thus appears that the role of the initial conditions is very important in determining the later behaviour of the chemistry .",

    "this has allowed the determination of optical depths for the isotopic species and the elimination of a model by which the cores contain many optically thick sub - clumps to explain the low isotopic co emission .",
