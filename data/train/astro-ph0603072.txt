    "after @xcite first pointed out the importance of studying the cosmic baryon budget , it is now widely accepted that only less than half of the cosmic baryons in the present universe have been detected , and the remaining portion , `` the missing baryon '' , has evaded the direct detection so far .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite suggest that approximately 30 to 50 % of the cosmic baryons at @xmath1 are in the form of the diffuse intergalactic medium with temperature of @xmath2 which is called warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , and subsequent numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) with different numerical schemes and resolutions also support this picture consistently . based on these numerical predictions ,",
    "many observational efforts have been made to reveal the existence of whim .",
    "since the observational signature of whim is very weak , the detection of whim is observationally quite challenging and first proposed through its metal absorption features in the bright background beacons such as qsos and blazers @xcite .",
    "after the first detection of ovi absorption lines in the spectra of a bright qso h1821 + 643 by @xcite and @xcite , number of detections are reported through absorption features of ovi , ovii , oviii and neix ions @xcite , but they are rather tentative . only recently ,",
    "the detection with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio is reported by @xcite and @xcite in which absorption signatures of whim are found at two redshift in the spectra of the blazer mrk421 during its two outburst phases .",
    "future proposed missions such as _ constellation - x _ and _ xeus _ are expected to detect numerous whim absorbers .",
    "detection of whim absorption in the spectra of afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are also proposed by @xcite and @xcite using a dedicated mission such as _",
    "pharos_. @xcite investigate the feasibility of such detections in a realistic manner based on cosmological hydrodynamic simulations . as an alternative strategy , several tentative detections of whim through its metal line emission",
    "are claimed by @xcite , and @xcite using _ xmm - newton _ satellite .",
    "however , these detections are not significant enough to exclude the possibility that the observed emission lines are the galactic ones because of the limited energy resolution ( @xmath3ev ) of the current x - ray detectors .",
    "recently , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite show that future x - ray missions equipped with a high energy resolution spectrograph such as _ dios _ ( diffuse intergalactic oxygen surveyor ) and _ mbe _ ( missing baryon explorer ) can detect the line emission of whim in a convincing manner .",
    "future x - ray observations of whim through its emission and absorption features are expected to unveil the physical properties of whim beyond its existence .",
    "so far , most of theoretical and observational studies on whim assume that the cosmic baryons are in their ionization equilibrium under a given physical condition , irrespective of their thermal history . however ,",
    "as shown in this paper , some portion of the cosmic baryons is expected to deviate from ionization equilibrium depending on its thermal history , since the timescales of ionization and recombination processes can be comparable or even longer than the age of the universe in a low density plasma such as whim . in this paper , we focus on the non - equilibrium ionization state of metals in whim . since ionized metals such as ovi  viii and neix are supposed to be good tracers of whim , the ionization state of such metals and their deviation from the ionization equilibrium state are of great importance in studying the detectability of whim and probing its physical condition . by relaxing the assumption that the cosmic baryons are in the ionization equilibrium , we follow the time evolution of the ionization state of metals as well as hydrogen and helium in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , and investigate to what extent the effect of the non - equilibrium ionization state affects the detectability and observational features of whim .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the importance of non - equilibrium treatment of ionization balance in whim is described in section 2 .",
    "in addition , technical details in computing time evolution of ionization fractions of ions are also shown in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we consider a simple model of thermal histories of the cosmic baryons , and investigate the non - equilibrium ionization state of oxygen ions and their deviations from the ionization equilibrium state to understand general properties of the ionization history of oxygen in the cosmic baryons .",
    "the non - equilibrium ionization balance in the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation is shown in section 4 , and the effect of the non - equilibrium ionization state on the detectability and observational features of whim is investigated in section 5 . finally , in section 6 , we summarize our conclusion and discuss other important physical processes which may also affect the ionization state of whim . throughout this paper ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , we adopt a spatially flat cosmology with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the density parameter , @xmath9 the dimensionless cosmological constant , @xmath10 the baryon density parameter , and @xmath11 the hubble constant in units of 100kms@xmath12mpc@xmath12 .",
    "the time evolution of ionization balance in collisionally- and photo - ionized plasmas can be described by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the index of a particular ionization stage considered , @xmath15 the atomic number , @xmath16 the ionization fraction of an ion @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath17 denotes the ionization rate for an ion @xmath14 with the ejection of @xmath18 electrons , and @xmath19 is the recombination rate of ion @xmath14 . as ionization processes , collisional , auger , charge - transfer and photo - ionizations are taken into account .",
    "recombination processes are composed of radiative and dielectric recombinations . the ionization equilibrium state , @xmath20 , can be obtained by solving @xmath21 ionization and recombination rates adopted in this paper are calculated by utilizing the spex ver 1.10 software package .    as a source of photoionization",
    ", we adopt uv and x - ray background radiation calculated using the cuba code @xcite throughout this paper .",
    "the spectra and redshift evolution of the adopted background radiation are shown in figure  [ fig : background ] .",
    "it should be noted that the intensity of the background radiation rapidly drops at redshift @xmath22 , while the overall spectral shapes do not change so much . in the right panel , we overlay the observed uv and x - ray background radiation estimated by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , for comparison . it can be seen that the spectrum of adopted background radiation at @xmath1 is consistent with the observed ones within a factor of two .",
    "although ionization fractions of ions in the collisional ionization equilibrium entirely depend on gas temperature , they depend on gas density as well as gas temperature under the presence of photoionizing background radiation , and the effect of photoionization by the uv and x - ray background is important in a low density and low temperature plasma . figure  [ fig : fraction ] shows the ionization fractions of ovi , ovii and oviii ions in collisional ionization equilibrium ( i.e. no background radiation ) and those in ionization equilibrium under the presence of the uv and x - ray background at @xmath1 .",
    "it is obvious that the effect of photoionization is quite important at a typical temperature range of whim ( @xmath23 ) and that it increases the ionization fractions of ionized oxygen in a lower density regime .",
    "( 120mm,120mm)figure2.eps    according to equation  ( [ eq : evolution ] ) , the timescales of ionization and recombination for an ion @xmath14 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , can be estimated by @xmath26 and @xmath27 figure  [ fig : timescale ] shows temperature dependence of @xmath28 and @xmath25 of ovi , ovii and oviii ions for hydrogen number density of @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 under the presence of the photoionizing background radiation at a redshift of @xmath1 . in a temperature range @xmath32  k , the recombination timescales are longer than the ionization timescales , and are comparable to or even longer than the hubble time , @xmath33 ( @xmath34gyr ) , where @xmath35 kms@xmath12mpc@xmath12 is the hubble constant . in a lower temperature regime with @xmath36 k , the recombination timescales are still comparable to the hubble time for hydrogen number density of @xmath37 @xmath31 .",
    "the ionization timescales in the lowest temperature range ( @xmath38 k ) are determined by the intensity of the uv and x - ray background radiation .",
    "it can be seen that the ionization timescales of ovii and oviii ions are also comparable to the hubble time at a temperature of @xmath36 k. actually , these behaviors of ionization and recombination timescales are also the case for hydrogen- and helium - like ions of other metal such as carbon and nitrogen . considering these facts , one can easily expect that the ionization balance is not in the equilibrium state in a low density plasma like whim .",
    "therefore , for proper treatment of ionization balance in whim , we have to follow the time evolution of ionization fractions by directly integrating equation  ( [ eq : evolution ] ) .",
    "( 120mm,120mm)figure3.eps    since the timescales for the ionization and recombination differ by many order of magnitude depending on ionic species and ionization stages , equation  ( [ eq : evolution ] ) is a stiff set of differential equations . in numerically solving a stiff set of equations ,",
    "explicit integration schemes are unstable unless unreasonably small timestep is taken , which leads to prohibitively expensive computations .",
    "therefore , implicit schemes are required to numerically integrate equation ( [ eq : evolution ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we adopt a backward difference formula ( bdf ) , which is also adopted in @xcite for solving chemical reactions of atomic and molecular hydrogen in the primordial universe . in the bdf ,",
    "ionization fractions of all ionic species are sequentially updated in the order of increasing ionization states rather than being updated simultaneously , and the source terms contributed by the ionization from and recombination to the lower states are evaluated at the advanced timestep .",
    "the discretization of equation ( [ eq : evolution ] ) can be written as @xmath39 we confirm that this scheme is stable and as accurate as the eigenvalue decomposition scheme by @xcite adopted for solving the non - equilibrium ionization state in supernova remnants , but our scheme is found to be computationally less expensive . in this paper , we simultaneously solve the time evolution of ionization fractions of h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , and fe , but we focus on only the ionization states of oxygen .    throughout this paper , we assume spatially uniform and time independent metallicity of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the solar abundance .",
    "note that the metallicity @xmath15 is very insensitive to the resulting non - equilibrium ionization state as long as @xmath42 .",
    "of course , in reality , metals in intergalactic medium are ejected from galaxies through the feedback of star formation activities , and thus the distribution of metals is inhomogeneous and time dependent .",
    "actually , for a fully consistent treatment , such feedback effect must be included in the rhs of equation  ( [ eq : evolution ] ) as a source term . in this paper , however , since we are interested in the non - equilibrium ionization state that arise along the thermal histories of baryons in a context of cosmological structure formation , we adopt such an assumption and believe that it is acceptable for qualitative studies of ionization states of whim .",
    "in this section , we explore the general behaviors of the non - equilibrium ionization state using simple thermal histories of the cosmic baryons . here",
    ", we consider a series of thermal histories depicted in figure  [ fig : simple_model ] , in which baryonic matter has hydrogen number density @xmath43 and temperature @xmath44 at an initial redshift of @xmath45 , keeps its comoving density and temperature constant before increasing its density and temperature to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , by experiencing shock heating at redshift @xmath48 , and keeps the postshock thermal state till @xmath1 . a physical scenario we have in mind",
    "is that the baryonic matter is diluted according to the cosmological expansion until it experiences the cosmological shock heating , and that it gets quasi - virialized inside collapsed halos or filamentary structures after the shock heating . here",
    "@xmath49 is the present - day hydrogen number density , and we set the initial temperature to @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , these thermal histories can be parametrized by three parameters , the postshock overdensity @xmath51 , postshock temperature @xmath52 , and the redshift of shock heating @xmath53 . in a cosmological model adopted in this paper",
    ", we have @xmath54 @xmath31 .",
    "we assume the uv and x - ray background radiation described in the previous section as a photoionization source , irrespective of the adopted thermal histories .",
    "actually , the thermal history of the cosmic baryon in a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation is fairly well represented by this simple model .",
    "figure  [ fig : trajectory ] shows the time evolution of temperature and hydrogen number density of gas particles from a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation presented in section  [ sec : simulation ] . in both panels ,",
    "time evolutions of five randomly selected gas particles inside a filamentary structure at @xmath1 are shown .",
    "one can see that each gas particle have nearly constant temperature and physical density proportional to @xmath55 before it experiences the first shock heating .",
    "after the first shock heating , although thermal histories of gas paricles in the simulation is not so simple as that presented in figure  [ fig : simple_model ] , it can be a viable model for qualitative description of the thermal history of the cosmic baryon since the timescales for temporal variations in density and temperature are much shorter than @xmath24 and @xmath25 of oxygen ions ( ovi , ovii and oviii ) .",
    "it should be noted that , in figure  [ fig : trajectory ] , we can see that some particles experience multiple shocks in a sufficiently short timescale compared with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and increase their postshock density by a factor larger than 4 , the value in the strong shock limit .",
    "therefore , we allow the density jump at @xmath48 to be greater than a factor of 4 in order to bracket the plausible range of the thermal histories of the cosmic baryons .",
    "( 120mm,120mm)figure4.eps    ( 150mm,150mm)figure5.eps    at the initial redshift @xmath45 , we assume that all baryons are in the ionization equilibrium state",
    ". this assumption can be justified by the fact that physical gas density is so high at such a high redshift that ionization equilibrium can be quickly realized .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : evolution ] ) is integrated along the thermal histories described above till @xmath1 for a given set of parameters @xmath56 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ fig : contour_map_simple_zs_1.0 ] shows the ratios of the resulting ionization fractions at @xmath1 for thermal histories with @xmath57 relative to those in the ionization equilibrium state , @xmath58 , for ovi , ovii , oviii and oix on a @xmath59@xmath52 plane .",

    "black contours with numeric labels indicate the ionization fractions in the ionization equilibrium state on @xmath62 plane .",
    "one can see that , for ovi ion , the ratios of ionization fractions significantly deviate from unity only in the region where ovi fraction in the equilibrium state , @xmath63 , is negligible , and close to the equilibrium value in the region where @xmath64 is higher than 0.1 .",
    "this is because , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : timescale ] , timescales for both of ionization and recombination of ovi ions are much shorter than the hubble time in the density and temperature ranges where @xmath63 is significant .",
    "on the other hand , for ovii , oviii and oix , we have significant deviation from the ionization equilibrium state in those density and temperature ranges in which their ionization fractions are not negligible , especially at low density regions with @xmath65 . only the region with @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "is almost free from significant deviation from the ionization equilibrium state .",

    "for all the thermal histories , ionization fractions of oviii increase rapidly just after the shock heating , while those in the ionization equilibrium state are lower than the preshock ionization fractions .",
    "this is because the timescale for collisional ionization to oviii ion is much shorter than that of recombination timescale . after taking their maximum values",
    ", oviii fractions decrease toward the equilibrium fractions .",
    "ionization to oix ions slightly slower and is delayed compared with that to oviii ions .",
    "ionization fractions in the equilibrium state also change in time because the intensity of the uv and x - ray background radiation is decreasing at a redshift @xmath69 . in the history",
    "a with @xmath70 and @xmath71 k , oviii and oix fractions in the ionization equilibrium state are increasing and decreasing in time , respectively . in the non - equilibrium ionization state , however , the ionization fractions of these ions can not catch up with the ionization equilibrium state because of slow recombination processes from oix to oviii .",
    "therefore , it can be said that the decrease of the uv and x - ray background radiation at @xmath69 is so rapid that it eventually enlarge the deviation from the ionization equilibrium state .",
    "the similar behavior can be also seen in the histories c and d. on the contrary , in the history b with higher density and temperature than a , the ionization equilibrium is achieved because ionization processes are dominated by collisional ionization and the decrease in uv and x - ray background intensity does not significantly change the equilibrium ionization fractions .",
    "figures  [ fig : contour_map_simple_zs_0.5 ] and [ fig : contour_map_simple_zs_0.1 ] are the same as figure  [ fig : contour_map_simple_zs_1.0 ] but for results with @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "as is the case for the results with @xmath57 , we also have significant deviation from ionization equilibrium for ovii , oviii and oix ions , while ovi fractions are close to the ionization equilibrium states for the region where @xmath74 . for @xmath75 and @xmath73 , fractions of ovii and oviii",
    "are larger than the equilibrium fractions , while oix ion is under - ionized in regions with @xmath76 and @xmath77k .",
    "these features can be understood by the same argument as the result for a history with @xmath78 that the timescale for ionization to oviii is much shorter than that of recombination from oviii to ovii , and that ionization to oix is slower than that to oviii .",
    "in this section , we compute the non - equilibrium ionization state for more realistic thermal histories of baryons obtained from a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "the simulation data of @xcite is used in this paper , which is computed using a hybrid code of a particle  particle  particle  mesh ( pppm ) poisson solver and smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) scheme .",
    "the details of our code are described in @xcite .",

    "the effect of radiative cooling is incorporated using the cooling rate for a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath89 by @xcite .",
    "the effect of energy feedback from supernovae is ignored in our simulation .",

    "thermal history of each gas particle is interpolated if an time interval between two continuous outputs is longer than the timestep @xmath93 in integrating equation  ( [ eq : bdf ] ) .",
    "the calculations are carried out with timesteps of @xmath94 yr and @xmath95 yr for a convergence test , and we verify that the results with two different timesteps are consistent with each other .",
    "note that our methodology is not fully self - consistent because the thermal history of each gas particle , with which its non - equilibrium ionization state is calculated , is computed with the cooling rate in the collisional ionization equilibrium by @xcite .",
    "however , since the cooling time for hot ( @xmath96k ) and low density ( @xmath97 ) gas like whim is much longer than the hubble time , the effect of radiative cooling on its thermal history is rather mild , and such inconsistency in radiative cooling does not drastically change its thermal history .",

    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : ratio_contour_map ] shows the contour map of @xmath150 on a @xmath98@xmath99 plane , on which three contours for @xmath151 , 1 and 10 are overlayed from bottom to top .",
    "considering the fact that the @xmath132 and @xmath143 in the non - equilibrium ionization state are lower than their equilibrium values at @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively , the left panel of figure  [ fig : ratio_contour_map ] indicates that the regions responsible for such departures in line ratios from the equilibrium state have a typical density of @xmath154 and temperature of @xmath155k .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : ratio_contour_map ] is the map of @xmath148 at @xmath1 in the simple model with @xmath104 described in section  [ sec : simple_model ] , and shows the essentially same behavior of @xmath148 on the @xmath98@xmath99 plane .",
    "this suggests that the regions with @xmath156 experienced a shock heating very recently around a redshift of @xmath157 , and that over abundant ovii ions due to the non - negligible timescale for the ionization from ovii to oviii reduces @xmath148 to below unity .",
    "note that the loci with @xmath156 on the @xmath158@xmath99 plane in figure  [ fig : ratio_contour_map ] and those with @xmath159 roughly coincide ( see upper right panels of figure  [ fig : contour_map_simple_zs_0.1 ] and [ fig : contour_map_simulation ] ) .",
    "we investigate the non - equilibrium ionization state of oxygen ions in whim by relaxing the assumption of ionization equilibrium and directly integrating the time evolution of their ionization fractions along the cosmological thermal histories of the baryons .",
    "first , we consider the general features of the non - equilibrium ionization state for simple models of thermal histories of the cosmic baryons , and find that ionization states of ovii , oviii and oix ions are significantly different from those in the ionization equilibrium state especially in typical physical conditions for whim , while most of ovi ion are close to the ionization equilibrium state .",
    "these deviations from the ionization equilibrium are caused by the fact that timescales for ionization and recombination processes of these ions are comparable to or even longer than the hubble time in low density plasma like whim .",
    "furthermore , we find that rapid decrease of the intensity of the uv and x - ray background radiation at redshift @xmath22 also enlarge the deviation from the ionization equilibrium state .",
    "this is because the timescale of the recombination processes is so long that the recombination processes can not catch up with the ionization equilibrium state , in which ionization fractions also vary with time as the uv and x - ray background radiation decays .",
    "the evolution of ionization fractions of oxygen ions for thermal histories obtained in a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation is also investigated .",
    "the ionization state of oxygen ions at redshift of @xmath1 is similar to that obtained in the simple models of thermal histories in which cosmological shocks take place at relatively recent epoch , say @xmath160 .",
    "statistically , ovii and oviii ions are over - abundant compared with the ionization equilibrium state in typical physical conditions for whim , while ovi ions are nearly in the ionization equilibrium state .",
    "spatial distribution of the oxygen ions reveals that the deviations of ionization fractions of ovii and oviii ions from the ionization equilibrium state take place at the outskirts of galaxy clusters and the edge of filamentary structures .",
    "we also investigate the effect of such deviations of oxygen ions from the ionization equilibrium state on the detectability and observables of whim through its emission and absorption line features .",
    "it is found that although the surface brightness and column density of oxygen emission and absorption lines slightly differ from those in the ionization equilibrium state , the overall detectability of whim is almost the same as what we have under the assumption of the ionization equilibrium",
    ". however , the ratios of emission and absorption line intensities between ovii and oviii , which are considered to be important probes of temperature of whim , are significantly different from those in the ionization equilibrium .",
    "this means that the observed line ratios of whim may not reflect its real temperature .",
    "it is found that the regions where the line ratios are different from those in the ionization equilibrium are located at outer edges of filamentary structures .",
    "distribution of such regions on a density  temperature plane is similar to the result of the simple model for the cosmological thermal history with @xmath104 described in section  [ sec : simple_model ] .",
    "these facts indicate that recent cosmological shocks near the edge of filaments around a redshift of @xmath157 cause the departure of line ratios from the ionization equilibrium state .    in this paper ,",
    "several important physical processes are missed .",
    "first of all , in our simulation , the effects of energy feedback and metal ejection from galaxies are ignored , and we assume that the metallicity of the cosmic baryons is spatially uniform and constant irrespective of redshift . since oxygen atoms are mainly supplied by type - ii supernovae followed by the formation of massive stars , the spatial distribution of oxygen is obviously time dependent and inhomogeneous .",
    "furthermore , the energy feedback by supernova explosions will affect the thermal history of intergalactic medium ( or whim ) in the vicinity of galaxies .",
    "therefore , a self - consistent treatment of galaxy formation and its feedback effect is required for better understanding of the non - equilibrium ionization state of ions in whim .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite performed numerical simulations in which the non - equilibrium ionization state of oxygen ions is considered together with energy feedback and metal pollution caused by galaxy formation . according to their results ,",
    "energy feedback induces strong shocks and additional non - equilibrium ionization state in the intergalactic medium around galaxies if the energy feedback is strong enough as performed in their simulations .",
    "therefore , the deviation from ionization equilibrium of oxygen ions in whim presented in this paper can be regarded as its lower limit , and the actual deviations from the ionization equilibrium may be much larger .",
    "secondly , it is assumed that equipartition between electrons and ions is achieved instantaneously , or , in other words , electrons and ions always have a locally common temperature . at cosmological shocks ,",
    "by which most of whim is heated , nearly all of the kinetic energy is converted into the thermal energy of ions just after the shock .",
    "actually , collisional relaxation between ions and electrons through coulomb scattering takes a long time which is comparable to the hubble time in a low density plasma like whim .",
    "therefore , as numerically shown by @xcite and @xcite , the electron temperature @xmath161 can be systematically lower than the ion temperature @xmath162 by a factor of a few in the outskirts of galaxy clusters and whim , unless other physical processes which convert the bulk kinetic energy into electron thermal energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) work efficiently . since the ionization and recombination rates @xmath17 and @xmath163 in equation  ( [ eq : evolution ] ) depend on the electron temperature @xmath164 rather than the ion temperature @xmath162 , such difference between @xmath162 and @xmath161 will affect the results obtained in this paper .",
    "we will address this issue in near future by considering the relaxation processes between ions and electrons .",
    "we would like to thank an anonymous referee for his / her useful comments and suggestions .",
