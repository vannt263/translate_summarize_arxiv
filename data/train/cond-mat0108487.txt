    "shortly after the early work of bcs , it was recognized that while nonmagnetic impurities would not affect thermodynamic properties of a conventional superconductor,@xcite they might do so in hypothetical @xmath2-wave pairing systems@xcite .  with the observation of a high density of low - energy excitations in superconducting heavy fermion systems ,",
    "such states were considered as candidates for the ground state of compounds like ube@xmath3 and upt@xmath4 .",
    "gorkov and kalugin@xcite and , independently , ueda and rice@xcite pointed out that linear nodal regions of the order parameter on the 3d fermi surface would lead to a finite residual density of states  at zero energy , @xmath5 this model was analogous to that used by abrikosov and gorkov@xcite in their discussion of gapless superconductivity caused by magnetic scatterers , namely a self - consistent second - order perturbation theory in the impurity potential @xmath6 averaged over disorder .",
    "pethick and pines@xcite noted that weak scattering models of this type were insufficient to describe transport properties measured on the heavy fermion systems , and proposed that large effective impurity scattering strengths , due to strong correlations , required a partial resummation of perturbation theory .",
    "hirschfeld et al.hirschfeldtmatrix and schmitt - rink et al.@xcite subsequently calculated the self - consistent @xmath7-matrix for impurities with phase shifts close to @xmath8 , and found a  pole in the residual density of states close to the fermi level which broadened into a disorder - induced `` plateau '' at low - energies , yielding metallic behavior of the nodal quasiparticles at low temperatures in the superconducting state .",
    "stamp@xcite then investigated the local density of states around a single impurity within this model .    with the proposal of @xmath0-wave symmetry in the hole - doped cuprate superconductors in the early 1990s@xcite ,",
    "the self - consistent @xmath7-matrix approximation ( sctma ) was used to provide a qualitative explanation of the effects of disorder on the @xmath0-wave state which provided important supporting evidence .",
    "for example , observations of a crossover of the london penetration depth from a @xmath9 to a @xmath10 behavior with a small concentration of zn impurities were not initially understood to be a natural consequence of @xmath0 symmetry , because it was expected that in  such experiments @xmath11 would be strongly supressed in a @xmath0-wave system .  in the unitarity limit , however , strong modifications of low - energy properties occur over an energy scale @xmath12 ( `` impurity bandwidth '' ) which can be much larger than the normal state impurity scattering rate @xmath13 which controls @xmath11@xcite .  analyses of transport properties also provided evidence for near - unitarity scattering , and helped rule out candidate extended @xmath14-wave states@xcite .",
    "[ fig : one ]    this relatively successful phenomenology was cast into doubt in a work by nersesyan , tsvelik and wenger@xcite , who pointed out that the utility of the @xmath7-matrix approach was based on the ability to neglect multiple - impurity scattering processes ( `` crossed diagrams '' ) , which are of higher order in @xmath15 or the density of impurity sites @xmath16 in three dimensions .",
    "these diagrams have an additional @xmath17 singularity in 2d coming from the line nodes of the @xmath18 gap , however , which leads to a breakdown of single - site perturbation theory and the need to resum at least a second class of crossed diagrams .",
    "this important paper led to a series of attempts to solve the problem nonperturbatively , following in most cases standard methods which had produced reliable results in the case of the disordered normal metal .",
    "by 2000 several such solutions had appeared in the literaturetsvelik , ziegler1,fisher , zirnbauer , pepinlee , but if anything the situation was more confused , since the various papers had each claimed to calculate _ exactly _ the density of states of a disordered @xmath0-wave superconductor , but had arrived at dramatically different results .  in particular , the claimed residual densities of states at zero energy were zero @xcite , finite@xcite , and infinite@xcite , respectively .     in this paper , we review efforts we began at that time to reconcile the various available theoretical results . we emphasize that our interest was primarily to understand real @xmath0-wave superconductors with strong nonmagnetic disorder , rather than classify models and search for universal physics .",
    "we also sought to understand which , if any , of the nonperturbative solutions was relevant to the `` realistic '' model and to experiments on cuprate superconductors .",
    "most of this work , involving both numerical solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations and analytical weak localization calculations , has been published previously.@xcite  in these papers it was shown that most of the various nonperturbative solutions are correct , and that subtle differences in symmetries of the normal state band and disorder models led to the conflicting results .",
    "in particular , the divergent density of states found in `` globally particle - hole symmetric models '' ( we use this language to describe models with normal state bands manifesting particle - hole symmetry on all energy scales , not just near the fermi surface ) was found to arise due to a qualitatively new diffusive mode with momentum @xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this sensitivity to `` details '' of disorder does not exist in the theory of disorder in normal metals , but may be thought of as a critical behavior of the @xmath0-wave state due to the linearly vanishing density of states .",
    "the general principle that random systems of different symmetry should display qualitatively different low - energy behavior in the dos has its origins in random matrix theory and was extended to @xmath0-wave superconductors by senthil and fisher@xcite and bocquet et al.@xcite while this concept is very powerful , it has not always been possible to calculate the asymptotic low - energy dos in a controlled way using field theoretical methods .",
    "this is particularly true for strong binary alloy disorder , which such methods have found difficult to treat.@xcite very recently , however , some progress in this direction has been reported.@xcite perhaps more importantly , there are no methods currently available other than numerical ones to treat off - diagonal ( order parameter ) disorder _ correlated _ with diagonal impurity locations .",
    "since the @xmath0-wave order parameter is supressed essentially to zero around strong scattering centers , this would appear to be an important effect , and we indeed find within bdg calculations that the case where order parameter response is self - consistently included in the numerical solutions to the bogoliubov - de gennes equations is qualitatively different from the case where the order parameter is assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "we argue that the physics of this correlated order response is relatively unexplored , and may lead to important changes in low energy transport@xcite , possibly even in three dimensions .",
    "in the final part of this paper , we present some new results for a lattice model of a normal metal where global nesting symmetry is found to play a role similar to the @xmath0-wave case , and show that previous analyses have come to some erroneous conclusions .",
    "in their original papers , nersesyan et al.@xcite considered models in which the scattering between nodes was artificially restricted , and mapped the problem onto a disordered chain which they then solved by bosonization , leading to predictions of _ vanishing _ density of states at the fermi level , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 either a universal constant 1/7 if quasiparticles were allowed to scatter across the fermi surface , or a coupling constant - dependent result if only forward scattering within a node were allowed .",
    "ziegler et al.@xcite then pointed out that a @xmath0-wave analog of the so - called lloyd model in normal metals was exactly soluble  for @xmath21 over the whole frequency range , and yielded a constant density of states at @xmath22 to complete the proof , however , they were forced to assume a lorenztian disorder distribution , as well as a rather strange normal state electronic dispersion , @xmath23(3rd nearest neighbor hopping ) .",
    "nersesyan et al.@xcite criticized this work as nongeneric due to the use of the lorentzian distribution , which has long - range tails with divergent moments , but ziegler et al.@xcite were able to prove rigorous lower bounds to @xmath24 for other distributions .",
    "shortly thereafter , altland and zirnbaueraltlandzirnbauer97 considered extending the wigner - dyson symmetry classification of disordered systems to superconductors ( i.e. to systems with a bogoliubov - de gennes - type particle hole symmetry ) and superconductor - normal interfaces .",
    "they argued that the number of possible symmetry classes ( and , by implication , universal low - energy behavior ) for disordered systems was restricted to the 10 cartan lie algebras , four of which apply to systems with bdg symmetry.@xcite    it may be worthwhile to review the general idea at this stage .",
    "the classification of disordered systems is based on the observation that some special symmetries obeyed by a random hamiltonian for every realization of the disorder endow the statistical ensemble of hamiltonians with the structure of a lie algebra .",
    "the special symmetries are , in the context of tight - binding hamiltonians describing the hopping of an electron in a random environment : time - reversal symmetry ( tr ) , spin - rotation symmetry ( sr ) , particle - hole symmetry , and sublattice symmetry . for a bipartite lattice ,",
    "the sublattice or  chiral \" symmetry alluded to corresponds to the statement that the hamiltonian changes sign when all sites on sublattice a are multiplied by -1 ( see below ) .",
    "clearly an on - site potential breaks this symmetry , which is therefore very special .",
    "that these four symmetries are exhaustive from the point of view of group theory follows from the classification by cartan of all possible finite - dimensional symmetric spaces .",
    "combination of the scaling approach to localization and the cartan classification of symmetric spaces then leads to the constructions of non - linear sigma models with the cartan symmetric space as a target space to describe the physics of localization in the presence or absence of these special symmetries .",
    "senthil and fisher@xcite were the first to investigate how different symmetries affected the dos of a disordered @xmath0-wave system .",
    "they first calculated the quantum corrections to the dos and conductivity in the `` metallic state '' defined by the sctma `` plateau '' , an analogy originally suggested by lee@xcite , and showed that the dos was supressed as @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 for @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the fermi velocity , @xmath30 is the plateau dos , and @xmath31 is the gap velocity near the nodes , hinting at a vanishing dos at @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , they gave a heuristic argument for an effective 1d model whose low energy properties should correspond to the 4-node @xmath0-wave system , finding @xmath33 below a strong localization scale @xmath34 for a @xmath0-wave superconductor with tr- and sr - invariance ( cartan class ci ) , and @xmath35 if tr is broken ( class c ) .",
    "bocquet et al.@xcite mapped a more general problem of disordered dirac fermions onto a supersymmetric field theory which could be solved by rg methods under certain conditions .",
    "they  found as a special case that for disordered d - wave superconductors with both broken tr and sr symmetry ( class d ) , the density of states diverges logarithmically as @xmath36 .",
    "the class c and d results are irrelevant to the current work , in which we concern ourselves exclusively with singlet superconductors in zero external field with nonmagnetic disorder ( generically class ci ) ,  but illustrated the importance of symmetry for the dos and localization properties in the @xmath0-wave superconducting state .",
    "all the above results were restricted to weak scattering , in the sense of a narrow distribution of site energies .",
    "noting that in the cuprates there was considerable evidence for localized unitarity limit scattering centers , ppin and lee@xcite embarked upon a new approach to the disorder problem , considering formally the exact @xmath7-matrix for a given configuration of @xmath37 unitary scatterers in a half - filled tight - binding  band .",
    "they predicted that the dos was singular as @xmath36 , and claimed that the leading such singularity was described by scattering @xmath37 times from a single impurity , leading to @xmath38 ( an integrable divergence ) .    in table 1 , we collect the results of several nonperturbative calculations for disordered @xmath0-wave superconductors . for each reference",
    ", we indicate with a few words which model was considered and the cartan symmetry class of the model in question .",
    "it will become clear from the discussion below that the symmetry class in each case was not always obvious to the authors of the work in question , and in some cases is still not settled .",
    ".nonperturbative approaches to disordered @xmath0-wave dos problem .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we focus primarily on the binary alloy distribution , where one  assumes @xmath39 @xmath40on @xmath16 of the sites , 0 elsewhere , and then averages over configurations .  in this case",
    "one may compare directly with the sctma .  in figure 2a",
    ", we show that the sctma result agrees quite well with the exact result over most of the energy range . very close to the fermi level",
    ", the dos appears to go to zero , except for the one case of very large @xmath6 shown .",
    "this scale is actually determined in figure 2a by the discreteness of the level spacing , consistent with the fact that the scale @xmath41 over which such supressions are expected in the infinite system@xcite is exponentially small in the so - called `` dirac cone anisotropy '' factor @xmath42 .",
    "there are small deviations in the curves shown between sctma and the exact bdg solution , but they are confined to an energy @xmath43 ; we postpone discussion of these features for the moment .",
    "note the divergence of the dos at @xmath36atkinson2,ting occurs _ only _ when the chemical potential is zero and the impurity scattering strength is infinite .  in the language of the sctma , @xmath44 _ and",
    "_ @xmath45 are necessary conditions .",
    "deviations from either of these symmetries splits the central peak and forces @xmath46 at @xmath32 .  the _ form _ of the divergence is difficult to deduce directly from the finite - size numerical results , although a claim has been made that the ppin - lee prediction provides a reasonable fit@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that one can also split the peak as described with the addition of a next - nearest neighbor hopping to the hamiltonian , thereby destroying the global particle - hole symmetry of the band even at @xmath47 on the other hand , if one performs the same numerical `` experiments '' described above with the ziegler et al .",

    "@xcite .",
    "random site energy distributions , which we can also study with numerical methods by distributing @xmath48 randomly ( gaussian , lorentzian , `` box '' disorder ) , never give rise to the divergences seen in the binary alloy models .  the density of states is again supressed to zero at sufficiently low energy , but the width of this supression is unobservably small for realistic dirac cone anisotropies and disorder values ( see fig 2b).atkinson2  we have studied artificial cases with @xmath49 , and in fact do find results consistent with a linear variation of @xmath50 for strong disorder@xcite , but it is clear this result has no relevance for the real cuprates .",
    "it is furthermore obvious that the usual models with random site distributions mimic weak impurity scattering , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and therefore miss these features of strong binary alloy disorder .",
    "an attempt has been made to treat unitarity scattering by conjecturing a duality symmetry connecting the perturbation expansions in the weak and strong scattering regimes@xcite .",
    "the prediction of this work is that a divergence should result whenever @xmath45 for the single impurity problem .",
    "note that this point of view implies that one should always be able to `` fine - tune '' the scattering potential to create a divergence in the disordered system , even away from the symmetric band case .",
    "while the idea is appealing on physical grounds , our numerical results do not support this conjecture ( see fig .",
    "2a , and discussion in the next section ) .",

    "we have investigated analytically the leading quantum corrections to the density of states in the @xmath0-wave superconductor , following senthil and fisherfisher in the weak scattering case , and extending the calculation to arbitrary scattering potential@xcite .",
    "we first calculate the particle hole ( diffuson @xmath52 ) and particle - particle ( cooperon @xmath53 ) propagators , keeping diagrams to formal leading order in @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the dimensionless conductance@xcite .",
    "these diagrams are shown in figure 3 , along with the self - energy processes to the same order which determine the dos . the usual diffusion mode associated with particle conservation",
    "is recovered at low energies ,    @xmath56    @xmath40where @xmath57 is the quasiparticle diffusion constant .",
    "the gapless mode in the cooperon channel drives the leading singularity at low energies , yielding the sentil - fisher result for @xmath50 given above , _  provided _ no further gapless diffusive modes exist .",
    "this is precisely the case if the green s function has , for a given impurity configuration , an additional symmetry relating its values on the two sublattices of the underlying crystal .",
    "we consider first the half - filled tight binding model on a square lattice with unitarity scattering case treated by ppin - lee , which diplays the nesting ( sublattice or  chiral \" ) symmetry @xmath58 .",
    "note again that the symmetry condition is only fulfilled if the potential is infinite , i.e. it effectively removes a site entirely from the lattice .",
    "it is easy to check that any second nearest neighbor hopping , model for the gap going beyond the simple nearest neighbor bond pairing model we have adopted , or any finite chemical potential will also break the symmetry .  any finite on - site potential @xmath59 does the same , regardless of whether or not the single - impurity resonance is fine - tuned to lie at the fermi level , in contrast to the conjecture in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ fig : four ]    the extra symmetry induces a new massless diffusive mode in the cooperon channel at @xmath60 leading to the divergence in @xmath21 .",
    "how this occurs may be seen by evaluating the dos slightly away from the symmetric point,@xmath61where @xmath62 is now the mass of the new @xmath63-mode .",
    "if the mass is finite , the senthil - fisher _ supression _ of the dos is recovered at energies below roughly @xmath64 .  on the other hand , if the mass vanishes , or if @xmath65 , the dos will increase with decreasing energy due to the sign of the second factor in eq .",
    "( [ pidos])@xcite .",
    "how the mass varies with deviations from the symmetric point determines the intermediate - energy behavior of the dos ; for example , for infinite potential and a tight - binding band , the mass is given by @xmath66/@xmath67 .",
    "it worth noting that if one tries to calculate this quantity in the nodal approximation , one can be easily misled ; away from half - filling for infinite potential , its value is determined entirely by the fermi surface curvature near the nodes . finally , the ziegler et al model can also be seen in this picture to be qualitatively different because the hamiltonian contains no terms which mix the two sublattices ; formally the green s function obeys the symmetry @xmath68 .  in this case , all singular contributions to @xmath21 can be shown to cancel to leading order , consistent with a constant value at @xmath32@xcite .",
    "altland and zirnbauer@xcite have pointed out that this model is equivalent in its localization properties to the symmetry class of a normal metal ( class ai ) ; it is nevertheless a true superconductor with a meissner response .",
    "since its electronic dispersion is very unphysical , this model , while soluble , has no predictive power for the cuprates .  in figure 4 we show the schematic behavior of the dos for the various cases we have considered .",
    "note that the functional form of the dos at asymptotically low energies ( below @xmath41 ) is not determined by this method , as indicated by the dashed portions of the curves .    before leaving the subject of nesting symmetries in the homogeneous case",
    ", we ask what a symmetry analysis might have told us _ a priori _ about the low energy behavior of the dos .",
    "although the hamiltonian of a bond - paired @xmath0-wave superconductor with half - filled band and unitarity limit scatterers obviously displays a bogoliubov - de gennes symmetry , it should not belong to the cartan symmetry classes c , ci , d , diii usually associated with superconductors .  according to the usual definitions",
    ", only ci corresponds to the unbroken time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetry we consider here ; the density of states for this class corresponds to the fisher - senthilfisher result @xmath69 , as discussed above .",
    "the obvious conclusion is that the additional nesting symmetry combines with the bdg symmetry operation to move the system into a new cartan class ; this has been recently determined to be the unitary chiral metal class aiii.newfieldtheories however , it is puzzling that both the single - node model originally studied by nersesyan et al.@xcite and the half - filled unitary scattering case both correspond to class aiii ( see table 1 ) ; the former model yields a power law dos @xmath70 , whereas the latter gives a divergence at small @xmath71 .",
    "the answer to this particular puzzle is that the cartan classification is a purely algebraic ( group theoretical ) one which must sometimes be refined by allowing topological considerations , i.e. , by deciding whether or not a physical model should be approximated in the context of the scaling theory of localization by a non - linear sigma model with the addition of possible topological terms . in this way models belonging to the same cartan class",
    "can nevertheless display strikingly _ different _ localization properties .",
    "the most famous example thereof is the integer quantum hall effect that naively belongs to class a but whose localization properties are described by a non - linear sigma model supplemented by a topological term .",
    "the model of nersesyan et al .",
    "is also endowed with such a topological term,@xcite leading to the deviation from the naive aiii prediction .",
    "in addition , the low energy behavior depends on the strength of the disorder , and for sufficiently strong disorder gives a constant density of states.@xcite thus knowledge of the cartan symmetry class is _ not _ a priori sufficient to fix the low - energy behavior ; a model calculation is required . in the background",
    "is a more general set of questions raised in refs.@xcite concerning whether a given disordered electron system `` automatically '' belongs to one of cartan s classes , or whether it requires some fine tuning of the disorder distribution .",
    "we do not address these issues here .",
    "it is also obvious that there is a further discrepancy evident in table 1 , in that the _ same _ model is claimed to have two different asymptotic behaviors of the dos as @xmath36 in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is why we have indicated the symmetry class of the model in both cases as aiii ? .",
    "at present it is unclear if numerical approaches can distinguish between these two predictions , but one of them must be incorrect .",
    "thus far we have considered numerical and analytical calculations with constant order parameter only .  in self - consistent calculations with strong scatterers , @xmath72 vanishes ( or nearly vanishes ) along bonds connected to the impurity site , and rises to its asymptotic value over a few lattice constants .",
    "the naive expectation is that the pockets of normal metal which form around the impurities should enhance @xmath73 , but numerical studies show that the superconducting gap tends to reopen@xcite relative to the sctma .  in figure 5 , we exhibit this tendency for a realistic parameter set ( i.e. no special nesting symmetries ) .    , @xmath74 , @xmath75.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : five ]    .2 cm we note that , close to unitarity ( defined by @xmath76 ) , the homogeneous gap case is essentially constant at the fermi level except for the single point at zero energy supressed due primarily to finite size effects .",
    "by contrast , even close to unitarity the dos exhibits a cusp - like behavior . away from unitarity ,",
    "the disorder - induced supression occurs on a scale which we have argued@xcite scales with @xmath77 .",
    "note this quantity is renormalized by the inhomogeneity@xcite in a nonuniversal way .",
    "the behavior of the low - energy dos in these calculations is quite different from the non - self - consistently determined order parameter case . in figure 6 , we show that over a wide range at low energies , the dos can be approximated by a power law , whose exponent is _ nonuniversal _ , in that it depends on the impurity potential , concentration , etc .",
    "of course , we can make no statements about the asymptotic low - energy form below some exponentially small strong localization scale .",
    "it is conceivable , even likely , that the lowest energy behavior is again given by the universal class ci ( senthil - fisher ) behavior .",
    "however , is at least interesting to ask whether off - diagonal ( in particle - hole space ) disorder _ correlated _ with bare ( diagonal ) disorder does not correspond to a different cartan symmetry class , or whether it is amenable to this classification scheme at all .",
    "no field theoretical treatments of this problem are available to our knowledge .",

    "we conclude this section by noting that , while the generic case of the inhomogeneous order parameter is quite different from the homogeneous case , the nesting symmetries continue to play a role .",
    "for example , the @xmath83 divergence at zero energy in the @xmath84 nesting case is preserved when one calculates the order parameter self - consistently , although its width is renormalized@xcite .",

    "naively , one would expect generic disorder to mix the @xmath85-states near the fermi level and cut off the weak nesting singularity , leading to finite dos at half filling in the presence of any disorder . however , nakhmedov et al.@xcite recently considered this problem in a weak localization framework , and came to the conclusion that the dos was infinite .",

    "the infinite potential simply removes a site from the lattice and therefore does not break the sublattice symmetry .",

    "in this paper we have tried to review a variety of approaches to the problem of disorder in the @xmath0-wave state at low energies . while we succeeded , using a combination of numerical and analytical methods , in understanding the sensitivity of this state to different symmetries of the band and of the disorder realization , most of the issues involved were of a purely theoretical nature .",
    "this is due to several factors : first , the strong localization scale is exponentially small in the dirac cone anisotropy ( expected to be of order 10 in the cuprates ) , so within the calculations with homogeneous order parameter the sctma proves to be adequate , modulo some minor bumps at intermediate energies , if one works sufficiently far from half - filling .",
    "secondly , the nesting symmetries considered do not apply in real systems , as they are always broken by finite impurity potential , nonzero chemical potential , and @xmath90 hopping .",
    "next , the systems in question are weakly three dimensional , and the mass in the @xmath91 mode will always saturate at a 3d crossover scale we estimate to be @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the interlayer hopping . on this basis , we have suggested that if the physics of low - dimensional correlated scattering is ever to be observed experimentally , the best chances are in underdoped , intrinsically anisotropic materials where the interlayer coupling is weakest .",
    "there are some preliminary results that such a downturn in the dos indeed occurs in highly underdoped lsco@xcite , but the situation is far from clear at the present writing .",
    "all other experimental results on systematically disordered cuprates of which we are aware ( performed almost exclusively on systems near optimal doping ) are consistent with a finite disorder - induced dos .",
    "the final effect we have discussed is the profound influence of order parameter inhomogeneity induced by and correlated with disorder in the @xmath0-wave superconductor .",

    "weak localization effects are the primary cause of differences between the exact bdg calculations with homogeneous order parameter and the sctma , and it is clear that they will be irrelevant in a truly 3d system , where we know the crossed diagrams are negligible . on the other hand , we have no real evidence that the effect of order parameter inhomogeneity weakens significantly in higher dimensions , since there is no well - controlled ",

    "it is interesting to ask whether these effects can strongly influence transport , since they fundamentally change the nature of scattering even at the single - impurity level , by adding a scattering channel with a completely different ( andreev ) symmetry .",

    "<S> .2 cm    we review work on the problem of disorder in the 2d @xmath0-wave superconducting state , and show that the symmetries of the normal state and the disorder distribution are vital for understanding the low - energy behavior . </S>",
    "<S> most previous theoretical results for the density of states ( dos ) are reconciled by a combination of exact numerical solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations and weak localization calculations , which suggest that a novel diffusive mode with momentum @xmath1 is responsible for a divergence of the dos in the globally particle - hole symmetric case . </S>",
    "<S> we note briefly that the simple problem of a disordered tight - binding band of normal electrons displays some similar effects , which have been overlooked in the literature .  finally , in the physically realistic case of binary alloy disorder , no particle - hole symmetry , and an order parameter which is supressed around each impurity site , a power law with nonuniversal exponent is predicted . </S>"
