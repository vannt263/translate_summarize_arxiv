    "the main goal of our work is to propose and implement the numerical model for solving turbulent flow based on the galerkin approach with nurbs basis functions .",
    "we show that it is possible to effectively solve turbulent flow described by the navier - stokes equations with @xmath0 turbulent model by the isogeometric manner .",
    "the objectives of isogeometric analysis based on nurbs ( non - uniform rational b - splines ) are to generalize and improve finite element analysis .",
    "it means to provide more accurate modelling of geometries and to exactly represent shapes such as circles , cylinders , ellipsoids , etc . due to exact geometry at the coarsest level of discretization it is possible to eliminate geometrical errors .",
    "it also much simplifies mesh refinement of industrial geometries by eliminating communication with the cad description of geometry .",
    "further refinement of the mesh or increasing the order of basis functions are very simple , efficient and robust . at the same time",
    ", isogeometric analysis has many features in common with finite element analysis .",
    "for example the isoparametric concept in which dependent variables and the geometry share the same basis functions .",
    "then the mesh , and the corresponding basis , can be refined and order - elevated while maintaining the original exact geometry . then the isogeometric methodology can be an useful tool for computational fluid dynamics , in particular , turbulent flows .",
    "high reynolds number turbulent flows are important in many applications .",
    "turbulent flows involve multiscale space and time - developing flow physics .",
    "the dynamic of all relevant scales of the flow described by the navier - stokes equations can be solved by the direct numerical simulation ( dns ) approach , which is too expensive for most practical flows .",
    "therefore the most common approach is the reynolds - averaged navier - stokes ( rans ) , which simulates the mean flow and effects of all turbulent scales .",
    "the efficient intermediate approach is large eddy simulation ( les ) , which can simulate significant flow unsteadiness that rans can not handle . in the absence of universal turbulence theory there",
    "exist many developments and improvements of the schemes including the empirical information .",
    "the model of viscous flow of an incompressible newtonian fluid can be described by the navier - stokes equations in the common form @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( dimension @xmath7 ) is the computational domain , @xmath8 is the final time , @xmath9 is the vector function describing flow velocity , @xmath10 is the pressure function , @xmath11 describes kinematic viscosity and @xmath12 additional body forces acting on the fluid .",
    "we do not assume only very small reynolds numbers , but there are still some `` limits '' for which this model gives reasonable solution or it is necessary to use very fine discretization .",
    "the initial - boundary value problem is considered as the system ( [ nns ] ) together with a suitable initial conditions and the following boundary conditions @xmath13 if the velocity is specified everywhere on the boundary , then the pressure solution is only unique up to a hydrostatic constant .",
    "the navier - stokes equations describe turbulent incompressible flow .",
    "this flow contains many eddies of different sizes which are changing in time .",
    "the numerical methods for solving turbulent models are divided into the following categories :    * * direct numerical simulation ( dns ) * + the average flux and all turbulent fluctuations are computed .",
    "it means , that we use fem ( or fvm etc . )",
    "method directly to solve the navier - stokes equations .",
    "it is necessary to use a very fine mesh to compute small turbulent fluctuations of the flow and a short time step for non - stationary problem .",
    "therefore this approach is very computationally expensive . *",
    "* reynolds averaged navier stokes ( rans ) * + this approach simulates only average flux and effects of this flux to the flow .",
    "it uses the time averaged navier - stokes equations .",
    "the special term appears in the equations which is approximated by the appropriate approaches .",
    "the most common approaches are @xmath14 or @xmath0 models .",
    "rans is very often used in practice . * * large eddy simulation ( les ) * + les simulates behaviour of large eddies which is realized by averaging of the navier - stokes equations in space dimension thus the small eddies are not considered .",
    "the behaviour of small eddies is described by the so called subgrid scale model , which can be for example computed by rans .",
    "rans is the most common model for solving the navier - stokes equations including turbulence .",
    "it is based on decomposition of the solution into the time - averaged value and fluctuation value . in two dimensions , the solution @xmath15 and @xmath16 is decomposed by the following way @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 are time - averaged values and @xmath20 are fluctuation ones . substituting ( [ eq : dekomp1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dekomp2 ] ) to the system ( [ nns ] ) we arrive at ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath21 @xmath22 the solution are the functions @xmath19 , the fluctuation values are not determined .",

    "this is the so called integration method , which necessitates an lrn type of turbulence model . on the other hand",
    ", this method does not need any wall - function approximation which is a common tool for obtaining near wall values in other methods .",
