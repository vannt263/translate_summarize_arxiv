    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are thought to be powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) because of their high luminosity and small size .",
    "the gravitational potential energy of infalling material in the accretion disk is converted into thermal energy and radiated away .",
    "however infall only explains agn spectra up to uv energies whereas agn are also seen to emit strongly in x - rays . to explain this",
    ", a corona must be invoked that is thought to compton upscatter the uv photons from the inner accretion disk to x - ray energies .",
    "the upscattered photons are radiated quasi - isotropically so some directly travel to the observer or illuminate the accretion disk .",
    "this illumination produces the so - called `` compton hump '' seen in the spectra of agn that peaks around 30 kev ( eg .",
    "@xcite for a theoretical discussion and @xcite for observational evidence . )",
    "agn x - ray emission also exhibits very strong and rapid variability that suggests the origin of the emission is very near the smbh itself . by studying the spectral and temporal properties of the x - rays",
    ", we can learn about the environment inside the strongest gravitational potential wells in the universe .",
    "variability has been a known property of agn for several decades .",
    "@xcite found that for seyfert galaxies the timescale of x - ray variability is inversely related to the x - ray luminosity .",
    "using exosat , @xcite were the first to be able to characterize the variability as aperiodic following a power law relationship with frequency , @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the power at a given frequency and @xmath3 .",
    "the most powerful and often used tool in studying time variability is the power spectral density function ( psd ) , which measures the contribution to the total variance that each temporal frequency provides .",
    "@xcite created the first broadband psd with exosat observations while @xcite , using the new _ _ r__ossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) that provided well sampled x - ray light curves , constructed the first high quality broadband psd and measured the first `` break '' in the psd where @xmath4 changed from a value of 1.74 to 0.73 as temporal frequency decreases .",
    "the slopes measured were later found to be consistent with 2 and 1 respectively due to @xcite not accounting for aliasing and a miscalculation of errors on the psd @xcite .",
    "this break was theoretically needed or else the variability would diverge as timescales increased .    since @xcite there have been numerous psd studies of agn @xcite all aimed at studying the long and short term variability of agn , measuring the break frequencies and power law slopes of the psd .",
    "from all these studies , a relationship emerged between the break frequency and black hole mass , however not only for agn but including galactic black holes ( gbh ) @xcite .",
    "since agn and gbh both harbor black holes at their centers , it had long been postulated that agn are just scaled up versions of the same system with the same processes governing both .",
    "break frequencies also occur in the psds of gbhs and using simple scaling with black hole mass , a rough correlation was found leading to speculation the break frequency is associated with the inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "however there was a large scatter in the correlation indicating that a second variable was needed to strengthen relationship .",
    "in particular it was seen that at the same black hole mass , higher accretion rate narrow line seyfert 1 s ( nls1 ) displayed a higher break frequency than `` normal '' seyfert 1s , so accretion rate ( actually bolometric luminosity to make all parameters independent ) was introduced into the relationship .",
    "these two properties of black hole mass and accretion rate correctly account for the scaling of break frequency from stellar mass x - ray binaries up to supermassive agn .",
    "@xcite .",
    "all of these psd studies , however focus on the 2 - 10 kev energy range because that was the best band for _",
    "rxte_. this band though can be affected by absorption , so most of the samples have been limited to seyfert 1 s since these , according to the unified model , have a clear view of the accretion disk .",
    "harder energies with e @xmath5 10 kev , though , `` see through '' any gas as long as it is `` compton thin '' with hydrogen column density , @xmath6 . with the _ swift _ satellite and its burst alert telescope ( bat ) , we can now begin to study the hard x - ray sky in an unbiased way because its energy range is 14195 kev .",
    "bat has been continuously monitoring the sky with a wide field of view for @xmath76 years , thus providing high quality light curves for many sources for the use of psd analysis .    since compton reflection peaks in this energy range",
    "we can also begin to answer the question of whether the continuum and reflection components of agn spectra show different variability characteristics .",
    "@xcite analyzed _ rxte _ spectra of 10 agn and found that the model that best described the variability was one with a constant reflection component and an intrinsic power law that varies in both flux and power law index .",
    "@xcite studied the seyfert 1 galaxy , mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and also found reduced variability in the 1445 kev band where reflection peaks in the energy spectrum .",
    "looked at the hard x - ray variability using the 9 month bat catalog , however the 9 month light curves were nt of high enough quality for a psd study .",
    "instead two other tools , excess variance and structure function were used in their analysis .",
    "they found that absorbed , seyfert 2 galaxies show more variability than unabsorbed , seyfert 1 galaxies , which is surprising since unless the agn is compton thick there should not be a large effect on the variability especially at these long timescales .",
    "they also reported an anticorrelation between luminosity and variability , similar to that seen in softer x - rays suggesting the same variability process is working in the 210 kev energies as in 14195 kev energies . however recent work by @xcite",
    "have highlighted the unreliability of structure functions in determining variability properties .    with the 58 month light curves now available , we construct and measure the psds of a sample of bat selected agn to further study the hard x - ray variability .",
    "we provide the very first psd slopes and normalizations in the 14 - 150 kev energy band and compare the psd measured variability with agn properties to determine correlations . because of the large energy range of bat , we also are able to test any underlying energy dependence of the psd as suggested by @xcite for mrk 766 and @xcitefor cygnus x-1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    " 2 details the bat observations and reduction of light curves including rebinning and filtering . ",
    "3 describes the construction of psds , selection of sample , and determination of psd parameters . ",
    "4 highlights the results of the model fitting including the energy dependence of the psd and correlations between agn properties and variance .",
    " 5 discusses the implications of these results and compares them to previous studies of agn variability .",
    "since november 2004 , _ swift _ @xcite with the burst alert telescope ( bat ) @xcite has been searching for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) in the hard x - ray sky ( 14195 kev ) .",
    "_ swift_/bat uses a 5200 @xmath8 coded - aperture mask above an array of 32768 cdznte detectors to produce a wide field of view ( @xmath9 str fully coded , 3 sr partially coded ) of the sky .",
    "when a grb appears , bat software can quickly locate the position to within 1 - 4 arcmin using a transformation algorithm and allow other instruments and telescopes to observe the grb .",
    "however while in survey mode ( ie not specifically observing a grb ) , bat is continuously observing the sky .",
    "every five minutes a new snapshot image is produced , and these series of snapshot images are then cleaned so count rates can be extracted for sources that were within the field of view . in this way",
    ", snapshot images are turned into light curves for a large number of hard x - ray sources due to the wide field of view and large sky coverage of bat .",
    "( see @xcite for details of cleaning process . )",
    "each lightcurve contains count rates over a @xmath105 year period in eight different energy bands : 1420 , 2024 , 2435 , 3550 , 5075 , 75100 , 100150 , 150195 kev , and then a total count rate for the entire 14195 kev band with each datapoint corresponding to single 5 minute snapshot image .    for our psd analysis , we first downloaded the 58-month raw snapshot lightcurves for each agn provided by @xcite on heasarc",
    ". we then added together the count rates of the first 7 bands , producing a 14150 kev band light curve to maximize s / n in the psd .",
    "we decided to discard the 150195 kev band data , because we felt it did not add any information to the variability of the sources due to the low s / n of the light curve at these high energies .",
    "the raw lightcurves were rebinned into time bins with a width of 5 days using a weighted average so that the psd was above white noise level that overwhelms at high temporal frequencies due to poisson noise . with this rebinning , our psds span the frequency range @xmath11 hz , 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "also any bin in the light curve with a fractional exposure @xmath12 was not used in the analysis to ensure gaussian statistics were still a good assumption .",
    "a cut of @xmath12 was found to routinely keep the number of raw light curve points in each bin above 20 , but still allowed for some bins to be kept that had less than 20 but a large exposure time .",
    "gaps in the light curves due to the filtering process , south atlantic anomaly , grb observations , and satellite maintenance , were filled by linearly interpolating between the edges of the gaps without significantly altering the psd .",
    "if too many bins are missing in the light curve , linear interpolation could cause an artificial smoothing and reduce the variability at high frequencies .",
    "all of the sources in our analysis had less than @xmath720@xmath13 of their light curve missing due to gaps .",
    "figure  [ fig_0 ] shows the light curves of a high s / n source ( centaurus a ) and a source 10 times fainter ( ngc 3516 ) after all rebinning , filtering , and interpolation have taken place .",
    "notice there is still distinct variability even at long timescales .",
    "to construct the psd , we first subtracted the mean count rate , @xmath14 , from the light curve , which has the effect of removing the zero frequency power from the psd .",
    "we then estimate the psd using the periodogram which is the squared modulus of the discrete fourier transform @xcite , @xmath15 ^ 2 + \\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\\sin(2\\pi\\nu_jt_i)\\right]^2\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is total duration of the light curve , @xmath18 is the number of bins in the light curve , and @xmath19 is the count rate at time @xmath20 . the periodogram is then defined as @xmath21 with this normalization , @xmath22 , known as fractional rms - squared normalization , periodograms from different segments of the light curve can be equally compared as well as psds from different agn .",
    "also the integral of the periodogram over a frequency range is equal to the contribution to the fractional rms - squared variance due to variations from the corresponding timescales @xcite .",
    "however variability is also introduced due to measurement errors and will manifest itself as white noise ( equal amplitude at all frequencies ) in the psd and cause flattening of the observed psd at high frequencies .",
    "the expected noise level in the psd from a light curve with gaussian errors is given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the error on the count rate at time @xmath20 . to test this estimate of the noise level",
    ", we constructed psds of a few clusters of galaxies .",
    "clusters are constant sources of hard x - ray emission @xcite so the psd should be fairly flat at the @xmath26 level .",
    "figure  [ fig_1 ] shows the psd of the coma cluster , one of the brightest galaxy clusters in the bat catalog . as can be seen , coma s psd ( solid line with error bars ) is approximately flat at the noise level ( dashed line ) within the error bars that were calculated using the method from @xcite",
    ". therefore equation  [ eq_3 ] should be a good estimate of the white noise variability power from measurement errors .    following @xcite , we then logarithmically binned the periodogram every factor of 1.6 in frequency creating equally spaced bins of width @xmath70.2 in logarithm .",
    "the lowest two frequency bins however were widened so there were at least 3 original raw psd points used in the average .",
    "as @xcite also show , a bias of @xmath7-.253 is introduced into the power of the periodogram so this is corrected for at this stage .    to determine which sources to use in our model fitting , we constructed the observed psds of all the agn in the bat catalog that had a s / n greater than 20 ( 76 sources ) using equation  [ eq_2 ] and used visual inspection to look for a significant detection of power in the psd well above @xmath27",
    ". s / n was taken from the bat catalog and is the significance of source detection in the bat sky map .",
    "30 sources showed a significant detection of power and thus qualified for further analysis with psd fitting and are listed in table  [ tbl_1 ] along with the properties of the bat observation over the length of the mission .",
    "all signal -to - noise ratios and agn classifications were taken from the bat 58 month catalog .",
    "mean count rates were determined by arithmetically averaging all the count rates together after rebinning and filtering .",
    "missing fraction was determined by taking the ratio of the number of time bins in the rebinned light curve to the number of bins expected if the light curve was uniformly and fully sampled .",

    "this occurs due to the finite length of the light curves , where we have essentially multiplied the intrinsic , infinitely long light curve by a box function with a width equal to the length of the observed light curve .",
    "_ aliasing _ is the transfer of power from frequencies higher than the maximum frequency sampled by the rebinned observed light curve ( i.e. @xmath41 or the nyquist frequency , @xmath42 is the width of each time bin of the light curve ) to lower frequencies and occurs due to the discrete sampling of the observed light curve .",
    "this can be thought of again as multiplying the continuously sampled intrinsic light curve by a series of box functions that have a width equal to the sampling time .",
    "both of these effects multiply the true light curve by a window function in the time domain which is manifested as a convolution in the fourier domain . both are also model dependent effects , because the strength of each is dependent on the true variability power in the corresponding frequencies for each effect .",
    "_ a priori _ we have no prescription for correcting for them unless we assume a psd shape .",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a more detailed discussion .",
    ") aliasing however probably is nt as big of an effect on the bat psd s since we are averaging over at least 20 points for each time bin .",
    "aliasing only becomes a large effect if there are big differences between the exposure of the time bin and the gaps between the time bins ( i.e. a 1 ksec observation every 500 ksec ) .",
    "the third complication is the determination of the errors in the raw periodograms .",
    "@xcite found that only when there are @xmath43 points averaged together in a psd logarithmic bin does the estimate of the power at a given frequency follow a gaussian distribution .",
    "high frequency bins easily meet this criterion however the low frequency points in the raw psds contain much less than @xmath44 points so errors can not be determined in the usual way by calculating the scatter in a bin .    to account for both windowing effects and the error determination , we use a monte carlo based technique first developed by @xcite , hereafter ump02 , called psresp that stands for power spectral response , and is a method that improved upon the response method introduced by @xcite .",
    "the basic process is to simulate many light curves for each set of model parameters , calculate and average together the psds of the simulated light curves , and determine the goodness of fit for the model parameters which is defined by a rejection probability .",
    "the set of parameters with the lowest rejection probability are then deemed the best - fit model parameters . in the next sections we detail each step of the model fitting .      to simulate the light curves we use the algorithm described in .",
    "this algorithm not only randomizes the amplitude but also the phase which more realistically simulates the noise process that produced the observed psd .",
    "the resulting simulated light curve is then calculated using the inverse fourier transform .",
    "the first step is to input a model psd that has some continuous shape that we wish to fit to the observed psd .",
    "the normalization in the model is arbitrary since it will just multiply through and can be determined later in the process .",
    "we must also choose for the simulated light curve a time resolution , @xmath45 and overall length , @xmath46 . to fully account for aliasing , we chose @xmath47s since this is the average exposure time for the raw bat light curves . any variability from timescales",
    "less than 800s are averaged over and wo nt contribute to aliasing . for the overall length of the simulated light curve we chose 1000@xmath40 . in this way",
    "the simulated long light curve can be broken up into 1000 simulated short light curves that are @xmath40 long .",
    "each short light curve will have taken into account red - noise leak since it was originally produced from a psd with nonzero power at frequencies lower @xmath48 .",
    "each short simulated curve is then resampled using the following procedure .",
    "only those simulated light curve points that correspond to a time that was sampled in the unbinned observed light curve are used .",
    "all others that do nt are thrown away .",
    "this produces a simulated light curve that best matches the observed light curve s sampling so all possible effects including gaps can be included modeled .",
    "the resampled simulated light curves are then rebinned and gaps are linearly interpolated through in the same way as the observed light curve .",
    "the psd for each simulated light curve is calculated using equations  [ eq_1 ] &  [ eq_2 ] .      after constructing the simulated psd s , the logarithms of them are determined ( @xmath49 ) and averaged together to form @xmath50 that represents our distorted model psd and has",
    "all the effects of windowing and interpolation included .",
    "the errors in the power at each frequency , @xmath51 , are equal to the rms spread in the set of @xmath49 .",

    "although @xmath54 is defined in exactly the same way as the traditional @xmath58 statistic , it does not follow the same distribution .",
    "in fact @xmath54 s distribution changes depending on the input model parameters . therefore to determine the goodness of fit we use the 1000 @xmath49 to calculate 1000 @xmath59 which is defined the same as equation  [ eq_6 ] except that @xmath55 is replaced by @xmath49 .",
    "each @xmath59 is minimized by finding the best - fit normalization in the same way as for the observed psd .",
    "the goodness of fit is represented by the rejection probability , @xmath60 , which is the percentile of @xmath59 that are less than @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath60 can be thought of as analogous to a p - value for a test statistic that measures the probability that the test statistic occurred by chance .",
    "a high @xmath60 ( i.e. low p - value ) signifies that the model does not correctly describe the observed psd . for this paper",

    "but this only takes into account the error due to measurement uncertainties .",
    "there is also uncertainty due to the random scatter intrinsic to the red noise process that produces the variability . for this uncertainty we used table 1 from @xcite .",
    "our light curves contained 400 points and the psds had a slope of about 1 , so we used an uncertainty of 0.18 which is halfway between the uncertainty of a light curve with 100 points and one with 1000 points @xcite .",
    "we then summed in quadrature the uncertainty from equation  [ eq_14 ] and 0.18 to determine the total uncertainty .",
    "figure  [ fig_10 ] shows the relationship between the psd integrated and time domain @xmath153 .",
    "while there is some scatter in the relationship , it seems that both indicators agree fairly well with each other within the error .",
    "table  [ tbl_5 ] shows the results of a spearman rank correlation test between the hard x - ray variance and bolometric luminosity , black hole mass , accretion rate with @xmath154 as the indicator , and column density .",
    "we looked for correlations using both the whole sample of agn and a sample of just seyfert galaxies because radio - loud agn could have variability introduced due to other processes associated with the jet especially in the energies studied here . figures  [ fig_10 ] &  [ fig_11 ] display the 4 correlations for both samples .",
    "as can be seen in the figures and table , there seems to be no significant correlation between any of the source properties and hard x - ray variance .",
    "none of the correlations have a null hypothesis probability , @xmath155 and the largest correlation coefficient is merely 0.23 .",
    "this result agrees with those of @xcite and that found the anticorrelation between variability amplitude and luminosity and black hole mass weakens as longer timescales are sampled .",
    "this can be explained as a consequence of the simple scaling of psd break timescales with luminosity and black hole mass . on short timescales ,",
    "the difference in psd breaks between different agn will manifest itself when determining variability amplitude since this is merely an integration of the psd .",
    "however as one moves to longer and longer timescales away from the psd break , variability amplitude increases ( as it should for red noise processes ) but eventually saturates , and the dependence on luminosity and black hole mass disappears .",

    "@xcite , using bayesian analysis and modeling light curves as a linear combination of gaussian ornstein  uhlenbeck processes determined the slopes and break frequencies of optical and soft x - ray light curves of agn .",
    "this modeling technique allows for a better interpretation of the actual physical processes occurring in the agn .",
    "they also find a power law slope of 1.0 describes very well the long timescale psd in the 210 kev energy range .",
    "this suggests the long timescale variability process is the same between the 210 and 14150 kev energy bands .",
    "we also compared the intrinsic variances of the agn in both energy bands , again using the excess variance calculated directly from the light curves to get a better estimate of the uncertainty .",
    "for the 210 kev psds , we integrated the psds we found in the literature , taking into account the break frequency when needed .",
    "some of the agn were best fit with a slowly bending power law model instead of a sharp break , however when integrating the psds , we strictly used the sharp break model to get a fairly close estimate , especially since the break is usually near the edge of our frequency range or outside it completely .",
    "figure  [ fig_13 ] shows a comparison between the variances of the two energy bands with a dashed line indicating equal variances .",
    "all but two sources ( ngc 4151 and cen a ) show an apparent increase in variance when the energy band increases from 210 kev to 14150 kev .",
    "this result agrees with that found by which only looked at the brightest agn in the bat sample and is surprising because variance had been seen previously to decrease as energy increases @xcite . using _",
    "light curves , @xcite studied the temporal and spectral variations of 36 agn in 3 different energy bands ( 0.52 kev , 210 kev , and 1550 kev ) .",
    "their sample overlaps with our sample , and their highest energy band overlaps the bat band .",
    "they as well found that the 1550 kev variability is much lower than that in the lower energies .",
    "however all of these studies used much shorter timescales than the one presented here . whereas our timescales are on the order of years , previous studies are only on scales of less than half a day .",
    "this seems to indicate that the variability process is timescale and energy dependent , where at shorter timescales lower energies display higher variability and on longer timescales variability is at least equal across all energies .    for 3c 273",
    "we were able to compare the break frequencies between the 210 kev and 14150 kev band .",
    "interestingly the break frequency seems to have decreased from @xmath203 = -6.2 to -6.8 ( 18 days to 73 days ) .",
    "however as shown in figure  [ fig_13 ] the total variance possibly increased or at the least stayed the same .",
    "this is probably due to the decrease in both the low and high frequency slope where the low frequency slope decreased from 1.0 to 0.6 ( although only an upper limit of 1.3 could be constrained ) and the high frequency slope decreased from 2.4 to 2.0 ( although this is because we fixed the slope at 2.0 ) .",
    "we caution the reader that without error bars from the 210 kev study , a valid comparison can not be made .",
    "@xcite suggests a model for the variability of accreting objects in which inwardly propagating fluctuations of the accretion rate couple at each radii of the accretion disk and modulate the x - ray emission .",
    "this model successfully explains the linear rms - flux relation seen in all gbh s and agn @xcite and can explain the energy dependent time lags @xcite .",
    "@xcite further investigate this model and determine that if the emissivity of the x - ray emitting corona is radially dependent , then there should be a change in the shape of the observed psd with energy .",
    "the break frequency correlates with the radius at which the emissivity drops off , thus for example , if the harder x - rays originate from a more compact region than softer x - rays , then the break frequency should increase as energy increases since there will be more variability on shorter timescales due to the small radius .",
    "our results do not rule out the possibility of this model but only due to the fact that we detected only one break frequency in 3c 273 .",
    "the bat psds were limited to the longest of timescales with the shortest timescale being @xmath7week .",
    "this is about the longest timescale that a break has been measured in softer bands with most breaks occurring on shorter timescales .",
    "the fact that the power law slope stays roughly constant around 1.0 does agree with the results of @xcite who found a constant low frequency slope with energy .",
    "3c 273 s measured break frequency , while seeming to decrease with energy , is still formally consistent between the 210 and 14150 kev band especially given the lack of error bars from @xcite .",
    "because of the large uncertainty though , the possibility remains that 3c 273 exhibits different variability mechanisms in the two bands , maybe due to its radio jets .",
    "recently proposed another model for both accretion onto a black hole and variability . instead of a smooth accretion disk flowing into the black hole",
    ", they use clumps of material falling in . these clumps",
    "collide and first form optically thick shocks that produce the optical / uv photons typically seen in agn and gbh s .",
    "the optically thick shocks then become optically thin while the whole time electrons are being heated .",
    "the optical / uv photons originally emitted in the optically thick shock provide the seed photons for inverse comptonization and are upscattered into x - rays much the same way in the usual accretion scenario .",
    "variability however is attributed to the actual comptonization process , and the psd break timescale is associated with the compton cooling timescale of the heated electrons . this model has been shown to reproduce the empirically found correlations between psd timescale , black hole mass , and accretion rate through simple physics .",
    "however our results with their limited frequency range are not able to discern between the two different models .",
    "what is needed are high quality light curves at these high energies on shorter timescales to be able to measure break frequencies in a large sample of agn .",
    "figure  [ fig_14 ] plots the histograms of excess variances based on the type of source . as before we grouped all seyfert 1 , 1.2 , and 1.5 as seyfert 1 and all seyfert 1.8 , 1.9 , and 2 as seyfert 2 .",
    "but we also grouped all blazars , nlrg , and blrg as radio loud objects .",
    "from the histograms there does not appear to be any difference in the variances of the different types of agn .",
    "the one object with the largest variance is mrk 421 which has been known to exhibit extremely strong variability in the form of flares over many timescales @xcite .",
    "however it is interesting to note that even though mrk 421 is the only source where radiation is primarily beamed , the slope of the psd for mrk 421 ( 0.8 ) is not different than the slopes of any of the other agn , it is just the normalization that is significantly higher .",
    "this suggests that long timescale variability might be caused by the same process no matter the type of agn which agrees with the results seen in ",
    "[ sub_corr ] .",
    "gbh s due to their closeness and large fluxes have much higher quality spectra .",
    "they exhibit state transitions characterized by their intensity ( high or low ) and shape ( soft or hard ) of the energy spectrum .",
    "the different states also show different variability that change the psd . in the high / soft state ,",
    "the psd is best fitted by a singly - broken or bending power law while in the low / hard state it is best fitted by a doubly - broken power law . for nearly all agn , in the 210 kev band ,",
    "their psd are similar to the high / soft state of gbh because they are best described by a singly broken power law ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "currently the only agn found to be best fit by a doubly - broken power law is ark 564 .    since our psd s",
    "do nt show any evidence for a low frequency break , they are consistent with the psd s of gbhs in the high / soft state if the psd is constant with energy .",
    "this is in agreement with studies in the 210 kev band including @xcite and @xcite .",
    "previous work looking at the energy dependence of cygnus x-1 s high state psd also observed a constant low frequency power law slope with a possible increasing break frequency with energy @xcite .",
    "our finding that the psd slope is relatively constant with energy agrees with this , and although we did not detect any break frequencies , the lack of detection indicates a lower limit for the break frequency at 10@xmath204 . with the exception of 3c 273 , our study seems to indicate that all of our agn are in the high state since we do nt find any evidence for a low frequency break that distinguishes between the low and high state .",
    "@xcite used archival _",
    "rxte _ all sky monitor light curves to determine the variance at roughly the same timescales as our bat light curves .",
    "they also find that the measured variability seems to indicate that agn are scaled up versions of only the high states of gbhs .",
    "they determine that if agn were in the low state with a low frequency break timescale , there would still be an observed correlation between the variance and black hole mass and luminosity whereas the high state with a singly broken psd would not produce any correlation at long timescales .",
    "this is exactly what we observe in our sample at higher energies using the more rigorous psd analysis .",
    "we have for the first time calculated and fit the psds of agn in the hard x - ray ( 14150 kev ) regime .",
    "the psds were fit very well with an unbroken power law model with an average slope of @xmath0 and only one object , 3c 273 , was found to require a break in the psd .",
    "the lack of break frequencies at the longest of timescales points toward a majority of agn being in the high state seen in gbhs .",
    "the slopes found are similar to those found in 210 kev psd studies and the total variance at these long timescales does not show any evidence of changing with energy .",
    "we did not find any correlation between the hard x - ray variance and properties of agn previously seen in lower energy variability studies .",
    "it seems that whatever process is producing long timescale variability is completely independent of the standard measures of agn including luminosity , black hole mass , accretion rate , and column density .",
    "this also holds when looking at the distribution of the strength of variability with agn classification .",
    "unfortunately our hard x - ray variability study has not provided much more insight into verifying the processes that are producing the variability since only one psd break was detected .",
    "however we have provided an upper limit of @xmath205 days for the break timescale of the hard x - ray psds leaving open the possibility that the break timescale still decreases with energy ( break frequency increases ) .",
    "further work needs to be done in extending the frequency range of the psds . with the recent launch of nustar this will be possible because it will be much more sensitive than bat . using webpimms we predict for a source with flux @xmath206 ergs",
    "/ s/@xmath8 a count rate of .07 cts / s compared to @xmath207 cts / s for bat .",
    "this will allow us to sample the high temporal frequencies just as xmm provided for the 210 kev band . combining the bat and nustar psds would give us a broadband psd spanning at least 6 decades of frequency allowing for better constraints on models for agn .",
    "it will also allow us to significantly constrain the break frequency if one exists and determine if the same relation between black hole mass , accretion rate , and break frequency exists in the hard x - ray band as does in the soft x - ray band found by @xcite .",
