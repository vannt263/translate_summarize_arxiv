    "sudden decreases in cosmic ray intensity during geomagnetic storms were first observed by forbush ( 1937 ) and are now well known as forbush decreases .",
    "observations of cosmic rays by neutron monitors and muon detectors revealed that forbush decreases are caused by the passage of interplanetary shock waves with downstream highly turbulent magnetic fields and by magnetic clouds that have well - ordered strong magnetic fields .",
    "the observations also showed that there is an anisotropy in the cosmic ray distribution prior to and during a cosmic ray intensity decrease ( cane 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "when interpreting and modeling the observations , it is very important to clearly separate the shock wave effect and magnetic cloud effect because their characteristics are quite different ( wibberenz et al . 1998 ) .",
    "there are many theoretical and numerical models for the shock wave effect ( e.g. , nishida 1982 ; thomas & gall 1984 ; chih & lee 1986 ; le roux & potgieter 1991 ) .",
    "although data analyses of the magnetic cloud effect have also been carried out ( e.g. , sanderson et al .",

    "; ifedili 2004 ; subramanian et al .",

    "1995 ; munakata et al . 2006 ; kuwabara et al . 2009 ) , and this has limited our understanding of the behavior of cosmic rays inside magnetic clouds .    cane et al .",

    "these were the first derivations of the three - dimensional geometry of magnetic clouds from muon observation data .",
    "they assumed that the cosmic ray density distribution inside the magnetic cloud is gaussian .",
    "validity of the gaussian distribution was not mentioned in the paper although the results were in good agreement with the geometry deduced from interplanetary magnetic field data .",

    "this model used an expanding vacuum cylinder as a magnetic cloud model . from the analysis",
    ", they deduced the cross - field diffusion coefficient in an interplanetary magnetic cloud for high - rigidity cosmic rays observed by muon detectors .",
    "recently , the role of gradient - curvature drift for cosmic ray penetration into interplanetary magnetic clouds , which are often observed as magnetic flux ropes , was investigated by krittinatham & ruffolo ( 2009 ) .",
    "they developed an analytical model of the global magnetic field structure of a curved interplanetary magnetic flux rope with its roots connecting to the sun .",
    "cosmic ray particles guiding center orbits were traced in the model .",
    "it was shown that gradient - curvature drift plays a significant role for 1 gev cosmic ray penetration into the magnetic flux rope .",
    "they emphasized that pitch angle scattering and perpendicular diffusion are also important .",
    "all the models described above only considered guiding center motion and ignored the gyration of cosmic ray particles , namely , the larmor radius of the cosmic ray particle is assumed to be infinitely small compared with the flux rope radius . however , in the case of high - rigidity cosmic rays inside an interplanetary magnetic flux rope , the assumption is not always valid .",
    "for example , the rigidity of cosmic rays detected by muon detectors is roughly 60 gv ( e.g. , kuwabara et al .",
    "2004 ) . assuming a typical magnetic flux rope near the earth with a radius of 0.1 au and an axial magnetic field intensity of 20 nt ( marubashi 1997 )",
    ", the ratio of the larmor radius to the flux rope radius is then about 0.669 , which is not much less than unity .",
    "this implies that the assumption described above is not valid for the high - rigidity cosmic rays inside an interplanetary magnetic flux rope .",
    "therefore , we should examine the effect of a finite larmor radius on cosmic ray penetration into an interplanetary magnetic flux rope .",
    "the purpose of this article is to discuss the effect of a finite larmor radius on the penetration process for cosmic rays into an interplanetary magnetic flux rope from the outside by considering the gyration of cosmic ray particles . in section [ sec : analy ] , we derive equations describing the behavior of cosmic ray particles inside a magnetic flux rope without magnetic field irregularities on the basis of the newton - lorentz equation of each cosmic ray particle",
    ". the numerical simulations of the cosmic ray penetration into the magnetic flux rope with magnetic field irregularities are described in section [ sec : numer ] .",
    "sections [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusions ] are devoted to the discussion and the conclusions , respectively .",
    "according to pitch angle scattering theory , a charged particle is the most effectively scattered by a magnetic field irregularity having a spatial scale comparable to the larmor radius of the particle . as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , the larmor radius of a high - rigidity cosmic ray particle , which can be observed using a muon detector , is comparable to the spatial scale of a magnetic flux rope near the earth .",
    "this means that the high - rigidity cosmic rays inside the flux rope will not be scattered effectively by a small - scale magnetic field irregularity , which has a spatial scale much less than that of the flux rope .",
    "for this reason , we ignore cosmic ray scattering by such an irregularity in the analytic model .",
    "this model can exclude an effect of diffusion and consider only effects of gyration and gradient - curvature drift .",
    "generally , an interplanetary magnetic flux rope expands as it propagates through interplanetary space .",
    "however , we ignore flux rope expansion because its rate is many orders of magnitude less than the speed of a cosmic ray particle .",
    "we consider a non - expanding cylindrical magnetic flux rope model with radius @xmath2 ( e.g. , marubashi 1997 ) .",
    "the model is defined in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath3,@xmath4,@xmath5 ) as @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the magnetic field intensity along the flux rope axis , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are zeroth - order and first - order bessel functions of the first kind , respectively ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 also correspond to parallel and antiparallel types of flux rope , respectively .",
    "parallel / antiparallel flux ropes are those with electric current flowing parallel / antiparallel to the magnetic field in the flux rope .",
    "the constant @xmath15 is the smallest positive number of the zero point of the zeroth - order bessel function of the first kind ; that is , @xmath16 .",
    "the newton - lorentz equation for a cosmic ray particle inside a flux rope is written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the mass , electric charge , velocity , lorentz factor of a cosmic ray particle , and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "a solution of equation ( [ eom ] ) is generally described by one parameter @xmath23 . however , as the solution mathematically defines a curved line on the spherical surface in the velocity space , it is possible to choose another parameter as long as one - to - one correspondence between the parameter and the time @xmath23 is confirmed . since a distance @xmath3 from the flux rope axis to the particle position is described as    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constants , @xmath3 is a monotonous function of time @xmath23 and there is one - to - one correspondence between @xmath3 and time @xmath23 as long as the sign of @xmath27 does not change . if the sign of @xmath27 changes , we divide the curved line at the time of @xmath28 into separate segments . for each segment , there is one - to - one correspondence between @xmath3 and time @xmath23 because the sign of @xmath27 does not change . as a result , @xmath3 instead of the time @xmath23 can be applied as a parameter for each segment of the curved line .",
    "we can rewrite equation ( [ eom ] ) for each segment as an ordinary differential equation of @xmath3 or @xmath29 ( equation ( [ rho_def ] ) ) by using the relation @xmath30 derived from equation ( [ def_r ] ) as    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the normalized velocity and magnetic field , respectively , defined as    @xmath34    @xmath0 is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the larmor radius of a cosmic ray particle for the magnetic field at the flux rope axis . here",
    ", @xmath0 corresponds to the ratio of the larmor radius of a cosmic ray particle to the flux rope radius .",
    "as the normalized magnetic field in the flux rope @xmath33 depends only on @xmath3 or @xmath29 , all segments of the curved line are described by the same equation ( equation ( [ eom_r ] ) ) .",
    "also as two consecutive segments pass the same point in the phase space at the time of @xmath28 , the solutions of equation ( [ eom_r ] ) for all segments should be the same in velocity space .",
    "therefore , in the flux rope , the solution of equation ( [ eom_r ] ) together with a condition @xmath37 and the solution of equation ( [ eom ] ) depict the same curved line in the velocity space .",
    "equation ( [ eom_r ] ) shows that the behavior of cosmic rays inside the flux rope is regulated only by parameter @xmath0 .",

    "equation ( [ sol_r ] ) shows that the particle position @xmath29 should satisfy the relation : @xmath56 this means that only particles having the boundary condition @xmath57 and @xmath58 at @xmath59 can reach the region where equation ( [ bdry ] ) is satisfied .    to examine the validity of the transformation from equation ( [ eom ] ) to equation ( [ eom_r ] ) , we compare the analytical solutions with a numerical simulation , in which a cosmic ray particle is directly traced in the magnetic flux rope . we integrate equation ( [ eom ] ) and @xmath60 by using the buneman - boris method . needless to say ,",

    "the trapped cosmic ray particle obviously gyrates and drifts in the magnetic fields , as described above .",
    "the trajectories of these particles in velocity space show oscillatory motions on the lines described by our analytical solutions .",
    "figures [ xy ] , [ rvrvpvz_60gv ] , and [ rvrvpvz_trap ] indicate that our analytical solutions represent exact particle motion including particle gyration and gradient - curvature drift in the magnetic flux rope .",
    "hereafter , we consider cosmic rays penetrating a flux rope from the outside ; that is , @xmath57 and @xmath58 at @xmath68 as the boundary condition .",
    "not all particles reach the axis @xmath71 in figure [ rvrvpvz_60gv ] because only particles with specific angles @xmath57 and @xmath58 satisfy equation ( [ bdry ] ) at @xmath71 . a cosmic ray particle entering the flux rope at angles @xmath57 and @xmath58 moves along the lines shown in the panels b ) and c ) in figure [ rvrvpvz_60gv ] until it reaches the innermost point where the left - hand side of equation ( [ bdry ] ) is zero .",
    "the particle then returns along the same line to the edge of the flux rope ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 components of the velocity of the escaping particle are the same as those of the entering particle if @xmath29 is the same , and the @xmath3 component of velocity is in the opposite direction and has the same magnitude when the particle is entering and escaping .",
    "panel c ) in figure [ rvrvpvz_60gv ] and equation ( [ sol_z ] ) show that the @xmath5 component of the velocity decreases when the particle is entering and increases when it is escaping .",
    "this is because the @xmath5 component of the lorentz force is always negative ( positive ) when cosmic ray particles move from ( to ) the edge of the flux rope to ( from ) the innermost point .",
    "we find from equation ( [ cz ] ) that the slopes of the trajectories in the panel c ) in figure [ rvrvpvz_60gv ] are steeper for lower - rigidity cosmic rays and less steep for higher - rigidity cosmic rays ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "cosmic ray particles penetrating from the outside of a flux rope must have @xmath73 at the edge of a flux rope , @xmath68 . from this fact and equations ( [ def_u ] ) to ( [ cz ] ) , we find that the cosmic ray particles penetrating from the outside of the flux rope can not exist in the region that satisfies @xmath74 when we call it a trap region .",
    "figure [ trap ] shows the trap region for @xmath67 .",
    "panels a ) and b ) are the trap region for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "these panels show that the solid angle of the trap region depends on @xmath29 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines in figure [ trap_area ] show @xmath29 dependence of the solid angle of the trap region normalized by @xmath77 steradian for @xmath67 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the solid angle of the trap region is larger ( smaller ) for smaller ( larger ) @xmath29 for a given @xmath0 , and is @xmath77 steradian in the inner region of the flux rope for @xmath67 .",
    "if cosmic ray particles are in the trap region , the particles can not escape from the flux rope and are trapped .",
    "we calculate the forbidden region to which a cosmic ray particle can not arrive from the outside of the flux rope for any @xmath57 and @xmath58 using equation ( [ bdry ] ) .",
    "figure [ penet ] depicts the forbidden region .",
    "the abscissa and ordinate are @xmath0 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the figure shows that low - rigidity cosmic rays , which can be observed by a neutron monitor , usually can not arrive at the inner region of the flux rope .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath67 , which corresponds to a 6 gv cosmic ray particle , the particle can not penetrate the region for @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the low - rigidity cosmic rays can not reach the inner region of a magnetic flux rope by only gyration and gradient - curvature drift .",
    "however , many events of cosmic ray decreases observed by neutron monitors suggest that cosmic rays exist in the inner regions of flux ropes . therefore",
    ", other mechanisms for penetration into the inner region of flux rope by low - rigidity cosmic ray particles are required . for these particles",
    ", @xmath0 is much less than unity and they can be scattered effectively by small - scale magnetic field irregularities in the flux rope .",
    "for this reason , we consider small - scale magnetic field irregularities in the interplanetary magnetic flux ropes in section [ sec : numer ] .",
    "on the other hand , since the larmor radius of high - rigidity cosmic ray particles is comparable to the flux rope radius ( e.g. , @xmath66 for 60 gv ) , these particles can reach the inner region of the flux rope from the outside by gyration . while the high - rigidity cosmic rays can reach the inner region of the magnetic flux rope by only gyration ,",
    "the effect of the small - scale magnetic field irregularities on the cosmic ray penetration into the flux rope is not clear .",
    "therefore , we also investigate the effect of the small - scale magnetic field irregularities in the interplanetary magnetic flux ropes for high - rigidity cosmic rays in section [ sec : numer ] .    in this study , we only considered the case of a flux rope located around the earth .",
    "since a magnetic flux rope is ejected from the sun and propagates through interplanetary space toward the earth while expanding , we must consider the flux rope near the sun .",
    "according to the expanding cylindrical force - free magnetic flux rope model ( shimazu & vandas 2002 ; berdichevsky et al .",
    "2003 ) , the flux rope radius @xmath2 is directly proportional to the time @xmath23 that has passed since the flux rope ejection at the sun , and the magnetic field intensity on the flux rope axis @xmath10 is inversely proportional to time @xmath23 squared . from these dependences of @xmath2 and @xmath10 , and equation ( [ f_0 ] ) ,",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is directly proportional to time @xmath23 .",
    "this means that the parameter @xmath0 near the sun is much less than that around the earth ; for example , @xmath67 for a typical flux rope located 0.1 au from the sun and 60 gv cosmic ray particles .",
    "this is the same situation as having low - rigidity cosmic ray particles around the earth because the behavior of cosmic rays inside a flux rope is regulated by only the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "therefore near the sun , even high - rigidity cosmic rays can not penetrate the interior of the flux rope by gyration alone , and the role of magnetic field irregularities must also be considered .      to examine the role of magnetic field irregularities in the penetration of cosmic rays into interplanetary magnetic flux ropes ,",
    "we perform numerical simulations in which cosmic ray particles are directly traced in the turbulent magnetic field .",
    "the direct simulations solving the newton - lorentz equation in the turbulent magnetic field were recently performed by some authors , for instance , in studies of cross - field diffusion ( e.g. , michaek & ostrowski 1997 ; giacalone & jokipii 1999 ; mace et al .",

    "we trace the cosmic ray particles in the magnetic flux rope with the addition of magnetic field irregularities .",

    "ten solid lines from the bottom to the top are density distributions calculated by simulations with magnetic field irregularities for time @xmath96 2,500 to 25,000 @xmath97 with an interval of 2,500 @xmath97 , respectively . dotted vertical lines in figures [ dhist6 ] and [ dhist18 ] show the forbidden distance , which are borders of the forbidden region calculated theoretically in section [ sec : analy ] and shown in figure [ penet ] .",
    "we can see from figure [ dhist6 ] , which shows the case for 6 gv cosmic ray particles , that the density distribution inside and outside the forbidden region is greatly different .",
    "out of the region , there is a density bump around @xmath109 in the later time .",
    "the density out of the forbidden region increases drastically with time and the bump is formed just outside the region .",
    "the bump is formed in the following processes .",
    "the particles penetrating from the outside of the flux rope edge are scattered by small - scale magnetic field irregularities between the forbidden region and the flux rope edge , and changed their pitch angles .",
    "these pitch angle changes can make the particles fall into the trap region , which is expressed as equation ( [ dregion ] ) and drawn in figure [ trap ] . as a result",
    ", the particles are trapped between the forbidden region and the flux rope edge .",
    "as the solid angle of the trap region near the forbidden region is larger than that near the flux rope edge ( see figure [ trap_area ] ) , cosmic ray particles tend to fall in the trap region near the forbidden region , not near the edge . accumulating these trapped particles ,",
    "the bump in the density distribution is formed .",
    "moreover , there is a small density drop just inside the flux rope edge .",
    "the drop is formed in the following processes .",
    "since the solid angle of trap region is very small just inside the flux rope edge as shown in figure [ trap_area ] , nearly particles can not be trapped in this region .",
    "therefore , the cosmic ray particles in this region are distributed like the steady state distribution without magnetic field irregularities ( dashed line in figure [ dhist6 ] ) . as the density bump is formed near the forbidden region",
    ", this fills in much of the density drop just inside the edge of the flux rope , which is why the small density drop is formed just inside the flux rope edge . a major role of magnetic field irregularities outside of the forbidden region",
    "is to make the particles fall into the trap region by pitch angle scattering . outside of the forbidden region ,",
    "the effect of a finite larmor radius is significant for density distribution . inside of the forbidden region , the trapped particles just out of the forbidden region diffuse into the forbidden region by means of spatial diffusion due to scattering by magnetic field irregularities and a magnetic field line random walk , which is why the density distribution in the forbidden region decreases monotonically toward the flux rope center .",
    "thus , a major role of magnetic field irregularities inside the forbidden region is spatial diffusion toward the flux rope center .",
    "figure [ dhist18 ] shows the results for the case of 18 gv cosmic rays particles .",
    "the bump in the density distribution appears while the peak of the bump is located closer to the flux rope axis compared to the case of 6 gv cosmic ray particles .",
    "this is because the effect of the larmor radius for 18 gv cosmic ray particles is greater than that for 6 gv . a density distribution in the forbidden region can be interpreted as the diffusion process as in the case of the 6 gv cosmic ray particles mentioned above .",
    "the density distributions for 24 gv and 48 gv cosmic ray particles are shown in figures [ dhist24 ] and [ dhist48 ] , respectively .",
    "these medium- to high - rigidity particles have no forbidden regions .",
    "the density distribution for 24 gv cosmic ray particles is almost flat in the inner region although the density peak is formed deep inside in the later time .",
    "although no bump distribution is found in the 48 gv case , the density in the inner region is larger than that in the outer region . since density in the inner region is smaller than that in the outer region for the density distribution derived from only the diffusion process ( cane et al .",
    "1995 ) , the distributions derived from our simulations , which include an effect of a finite larmor radius , are reverse distributions compared to those derived from the diffusion process only . in these rigidity ranges , a major role of magnetic field irregularities is to make the particles fall into the trap region by pitch angle scattering .",
    "these facts show that the effect of a finite larmor radius is significant , and we must consider that effect .",
    "in this study , we used an isotropic magnetic field irregularity model in an interplanetary magnetic flux rope .",
    "however , the irregularities in the magnetic flux rope are likely to be anisotropic ( leamon et al . 1998 ; narock & lepping 2007 ) .",
    "anisotropic magnetic field irregularities cause somewhat large perpendicular diffusion compared to that due to isotropic magnetic field irregularities ( giacalone & jokipii 1999 ) .",
    "the intensity of magnetic field irregularities ( @xmath93 ^ 2=0.01 $ ] in this study ) may also be a little different .",
    "therefore , our results may be modified somewhat quantitatively by the anisotropic magnetic field irregularities and its intensity . in our model",
    ", we also used a minimum and maximum wave number , and the correlation lengths of the turbulent spectrum were set as the specified values .",
    "these values may be a little different from the real situation .",
    "we performed many simulations for other parameters and confirmed that they did not cause the results to change qualitatively .    generally , the magnitude of forbush decreases is highly variable between several to a couple of tens percent for neutron monitor observations ( cane et al . 1996 ) .",
    "however , our model shows a much larger decrease ( see figure [ dhist6 ] ) .",
    "the reason for this difference is that simulation time is shorter than propagation time from the sun to the earth .",
    "the simulation time in our model is 25,000 @xmath97 , corresponding to 0.6 days , because our simulation is time - consuming . in reality , however , the time when a flux rope propagates from the sun to the earth is about 1.5 to 2.5 days . if the simulation runs for a longer time , the cosmic ray density in the flux rope will increase and magnitude of decrease will be smaller .",
    "we have now investigated more realistic models with longer simulation time .",
    "we should discuss the effects of the flux rope curvature and magnetic field configuration for a realistic situation .",
    "first , we discuss the effect of curvature of the axis of an interplanetary magnetic flux rope . in the curved flux rope",
    ", a cosmic ray particle can have a radial component of gradient - curvature drift velocity and a cosmic ray can penetrate into the flux rope , as discussed by krittinatham & ruffolo ( 2009 ) .",
    "they demonstrated that cosmic ray particles can penetrate into the outer part of a flux rope by means of drift and penetrate into the inner part of a flux rope by diffusion .",
    "this is similar to our result , which is the penetration by diffusion into the inner part of the flux rope . on the other hand ,",
    "the mechanism of penetration into the outer part is different from theirs .",
    "this difference is caused by an effect of the finite larmor radius .",
    "our result shows that cosmic ray particles can penetrate into the outer part of a flux rope via the effect of the finite larmor radius .",
    "cosmic ray penetration into the curved flux rope with this effect should be further investigated and will advance .",
    "second , we discuss the magnetic field configuration .",
    "the roots of magnetic field lines of some interplanetary magnetic flux ropes may be detached from the solar surface and connected to interplanetary magnetic fields ( gosling et al .",
    "1995 ; cane et al .",
    "in this situation , cosmic ray particles for a low @xmath0 parameter may be able to penetrate into flux ropes along interplanetary magnetic field lines because the larmor radius is small compared with the flux rope radius .",
    "this may also fill the inner region with cosmic ray particles .",
    "an interplanetary magnetic flux rope is often accompanied by a shock wave in front of it .",
    "this shock wave can accelerate particles and be one of an origin of solar energetic particles .",
    "these energetic particles can also penetrate across the flux rope boundary .",
    "the penetration of these particles is , mainly , diffusion and gradient - curvature drift , and the effect of the finite larmor radius is small because the particles energy is several mev to gev and the larmor radius is negligibly small compared to the flux rope radius .",
    "we studied processes for the penetration of cosmic rays into an interplanetary magnetic flux rope , focused on an effect of the finite larmor radius and magnetic field irregularities .",
    "we considered a cylindrical magnetic flux rope as a model of an interplanetary magnetic flux rope .",
    "first , we derived an analytical solution for cosmic ray behavior in a magnetic flux rope under the assumption there is no scattering by small - scale magnetic field irregularities .",
    "the solution showed that cosmic ray behavior is determined by only the parameter @xmath0 ; that is , the ratio of the cosmic ray larmor radius at the flux rope axis to the flux rope radius .",
    "we showed that cosmic rays can not penetrate into the inner region of a flux rope by only gyration and gradient - curvature drift in the case of small @xmath0 .",
    "next , we performed a numerical simulation of cosmic ray penetration into an interplanetary magnetic flux rope .",
    "the simulation included an effect of small - scale magnetic field irregularities .",
    "the results showed that cosmic rays can penetrate into the magnetic flux rope even in the case of small @xmath0 by the effect of small - scale magnetic field irregularities .",
    "the result deduced from the simulation is that the high - rigidity cosmic ray penetration is dominated by diffusion when the flux rope is located near the sun while dominated by gyration when it is located near the earth .",
    "this simulation also showed that a cosmic ray density distribution for the case of moderate to large @xmath0 parameter is greatly different from the distribution deduced from a guiding center approximation shown in previous studies .",
    "our results show that the effects of the finite larmor radius and magnetic field irregularities cause the bump or reverse cosmic ray density distribution inside the interplanetary magnetic flux rope .",
    "the conclusion of this study is that an effect of the finite larmor radius is significant for the cosmic ray penetration into an interplanetary magnetic flux rope if the larmor radius of cosmic ray particles in the flux rope is not negligible compared to the flux rope radius .",
