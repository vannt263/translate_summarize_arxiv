    "standard general relativity ( gr ) is not enough to describe phenomena that recently appeared in fundamental physics , in astrophysics and cosmology such as the late - time cosmic acceleration @xcite , the dark matter phenomena @xcite , and several issues related to quantum field theories in curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "a pioneering work to address the late time acceleration is @xcite , where it is proposed that a fraction of the total energy density appears in the form of homogeneous `` dark energy '' and it is discussed the dynamics which leads to the time evolution of such a dark energy .",
    "furthermore , modifications and extensions of the theory could be necessary in order to explain those puzzles .",
    "one of the attempts is a modification of the hilbert - einstein lagrangian as a general function of the ricci scalar @xmath3 , the so - called @xmath4 theories of gravity @xcite . in this perspective , the dynamics of gravitation is given by field equations which can be considered in two different approaches : the metric and palatini formalism .",
    "the former approach relies on the usual variation of the action with respect to the metric tensor whereas the palatini formalism deals with metric and ( torsionless ) connection as two independent quantities and the variation is taken with respect to both . in the case of gr ,",
    "the two approaches are equivalent ( they provide the same field equations ) . however , in @xmath4 gravity , the metric formalism leads to a system of fourth - order partial differential equations while the palatini one gives second - order equations .",
    "note also that both formalisms are dynamically equivalent to different classes of brans - dicke - like theories , which implies that they can not be equivalent to each other @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath4 theories of gravity in the metric and in the palatini formalism yield different physical predictions .",
    "both formalisms have been recently combined in a new approach denoted hybrid metric - palatini gravity or @xmath5 gravity @xcite . here , the action is taken as the standard hilbert - einstein ( linear in ricci scalar @xmath3 ) plus a non - linear term in the palatini curvature scalar @xmath6 .",
    "similarly as for the metric and palatini formalism , @xmath5 gravity can be transformed into scalar - tensor theory @xcite . using the respective dynamically equivalent scalar - tensor representation ,",
    "it was shown that the theory can pass the solar system observational constraints even if the scalar field is very light .",
    "this implies the existence of a long - range scalar field , which is able to modify the cosmological and galactic dynamics , but leaves the solar system unaffected .",
    "the absence of instabilities in perturbations was also verified and explicit models , consistent with local tests , lead to the late - time cosmic speed - up .",
    "it was also shown that the theory can be formulated in terms of the quantity @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath3 are the traces of the stress - energy and ricci tensors , respectively .",
    "the variable @xmath9 represents the deviation with respect to the field equation trace of gr .",
    "the cosmological applications of this metric - palatini gravitational theory were explored , and cosmological solutions , coming from the scalar - tensor representation of @xmath5-gravity , have been derived @xcite .",
    "furthermore , criteria to obtain cosmic acceleration were discussed and the field equations were analyzed as a dynamical system .",
    "several classes of dynamical cosmological solutions , depending on the functional form of the effective scalar field potential , describing both accelerating and decelerating universes have been explicitly obtained .",
    "furthermore , the cosmological perturbation equations were derived and applied to uncover the nature of the propagating scalar degree of freedom and the signatures that these models predict in the large - scale structure .",
    "the cauchy problem was also explored and it was shown that the initial value problem can always be well - formulated and , furthermore , can be well - posed depending on the adopted matter sources @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the possibility that wormholes are supported in the metric - palatini gravitational theory was also explored and it was shown that the higher - curvature derivatives sustain these exotic spacetimes @xcite .    at the intermediate galactic scale , the possibility that the behavior of the rotational velocities of test particles gravitating around galaxies could be explained within the framework of the hybrid metric - palatini gravitational theory was also considered @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the circular velocity can be explicitly obtained as a function of the scalar field of the equivalent scalar - tensor description .",
    "the possibility of constraining the form of the scalar field potential and the parameters of the model by using the stellar velocity dispersions was also analyzed .",
    "all the physical and geometrical quantities and the numerical parameters in hybrid metric - palatini gravity were expressed in terms of observable / measurable parameters , such as the circular velocity , the baryonic mass of the galaxy , the doppler frequency shifts , and the stellar dispersion velocity , respectively .",
    "therefore , the obtained results open the possibility of testing the hybrid gravity at galactic and extra - galactic scales by using direct astronomical observations .    in this context",
    ", the virial theorem was also generalized in the scalar - tensor representation of the metric - palatini gravity @xcite .",
    "more specifically , taking into account the relativistic collisionless boltzmann equation , it was shown that the supplementary geometric terms in the gravitational field equations provide an effective contribution to the gravitational potential energy .",
    "it was shown that the total virial mass is proportional to the effective mass associated with the new terms generated by the effective scalar field , and the baryonic mass .",
    "this shows that the geometric origin in the generalized virial theorem may account for the well - known virial theorem mass discrepancy in clusters of galaxies .",
    "in addition to this , astrophysical applications of the model were also considered and shown that the model predicts that the mass associated to the scalar field and its effects extend beyond the virial radius of the clusters of galaxies . according to the galaxy cluster velocity dispersion profiles",
    ", the generalized virial theorem can be an efficient tool in testing observationally the viability of this class of gravity models .",
    "however , the problem of selecting viable models can not be posed only at a phenomenological level but should be considered also at the fundamental level . to this end , symmetries are extremely useful to fix self - consistent models . in particular , noether symmetries , beside selecting conserved quantities , are also useful to reduce dynamical systems and find out exact solutions . in cosmology",
    ", the so - called noether symmetry approach revealed extremely useful to work out physically motivated models related to conservation laws @xcite .",
    "the noether symmetry approach has been applied in cosmology by many authors in various contexts , such as in scalar - tensor gravity @xcite , higher order gravity @xcite , and in teleparallel gravity @xcite .",
    "for instance , new exact solutions for cosmological models with a minimally coupled scalar field were first found by requiring the existence of a noether symmetry for a lagrangian description on a two - dimensional `` configuration space '' @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of two dimensional minisuperspace cosmological models , at the classical and quantum levels , was investigated and exact solutions achieved by using the noether symmetry approach considering , as phase space variables , the frw scale factor and the scalar field @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the noether symmetry approach can be applied to quantum cosmology @xcite , phantom quintessence cosmology @xcite , to spinor and scalar field models @xcite .",
    "finally , the dynamics of homogeneous cosmologies with a scalar field source with an arbitrary self - interaction potential was also explored in @xcite .",
    "bianchi universes and related noether symmetries have been considered in @xcite .    indeed , the literature on the applications of noether symmetries in extensive , and we mention only a few works relative to the analysis of nonminimally coupled scalar field cosmologies .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , a systematic analysis of nonminimally coupled cosmologies in @xmath10dimensional homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes was performed . in @xcite ,",
    "nonminimally coupled scalar fields were studied in the palatini formalism , and in @xcite , applying noether s symmetries exact solutions in flat nonminimally coupled cosmological models were obtained . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a cosmological model where a fermion field is nonminimally coupled with the gravitational field was analysed . by applying the noether symmetry approach ,",
    "cosmological solutions were found showing that a nonminimally coupled fermion field behaves as an inflaton describing an accelerated inflationary scenario , whereas the minimally coupled fermion field describes a decelerated period being identified as dark matter .    in the higher gravity context ,",
    "the application of the noether theorem is a powerful tool to find solutions of the field equations and select viable models @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that higher - order corrections of the einstein - hilbert action of general relativity can be recovered by imposing the existence of a noether symmetry to a class of theories of gravity where the ricci scalar @xmath3 and its dalembertian @xmath11 were present .",
    "it was also shown that by using the noether symmetries in minisuperspace quantum cosmology , the existence of conserved quantities provides selection rules to recover classical behaviors in the cosmic evolution @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the existence of noether symmetries in minisuperspace provides the form of the @xmath4 function and the cosmic evolution of the scale factor . in @xcite , considering a frw space - time and a perfect fluid described by a barotropic equation of state , the reparametrization invariance of the resulting @xmath4 lagrangian was used to work in the equivalent constant potential description .",
    "in addition to this , the integrals of motion were used to analytically solve the equations of the corresponding models .",
    "indeed , the application to modified gravity is extensive , and in addition to the above work , we refer to the noether symmetric @xmath4 quantum cosmology and its classical correlations @xcite , to the lie point and",
    "variational symmetries in minisuperspace einstein gravity @xcite , and to the noether symmetry in @xmath12 theory , where @xmath8 is the trace of the torsion tensor @xcite .",
    "scalar tensor teleparallel dark gravity has also been explored via the noether symmetry approach in @xcite .",
    "the noether gauge symmetry for @xmath4 gravity in the palatini formalism has been developed in @xcite ; hamiltonian dynamics and noether symmetries in extended gravity cosmology has been considered @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider point symmetries in order to obtain exact solutions of the field equations and invariant solutions for the hybrid gravity wheeler - dewitt equation ( wdw ) in a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime .",
    "in fact , the infinitesimal generator of a point transformation , which leaves invariant the field equations , is a noether symmetry .",
    "this feature provides integrals of motions capable of reducing the related dynamical system and then getting exact solutions . for the determination of the noether symmetries of the classical lagrangian",
    ", we will apply the geometric procedure outlined in @xcite , where the noether symmetries of the lagrangian are connected to the collineations of the second order tensor which is defined by the kinematic part of the lagrangian .",
    "therefore the noether symmetry is not only a criterion for the integrability of the system but also a geometric criterion since it allows to select the free functions of the theory .",
    "this approach has been applied in @xcite . furthermore , in order to solve exactly the wdw equation we will apply the theory of lie invariants that allows to determine the lie point symmetries of the wdw equation . as shown in @xcite , the lie point symmetries for the wdw equation ( or the klein gordon equation ) are connected to the conformal lie algebra of the minisuperspace which defines the laplace operator .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in sec . [ fieldequations ] , we introduce the basic definitions of the hybrid gravity and we show that it is possible to write the field equations in terms of a nonminimally coupled scalar field theory . in sec . [ nps ] , we apply the noether symmetry approach to the hybrid gravity lagrangian .",
