    "the studies of quantum antiferromagnets ( afs ) in external magnetic field attract significant attention because these systems exhibit a variety of unusual quantum - mechanical phenomena of general interest .",
    "the modern high magnetic field technology , materials synthesis , and experimental probes allow precise measurements in the regime of the field strength comparable to the characteristic exchange constant of a system .",
    "this has made possible the observations of condensation of triplet excitations in a variety of chain , ladder , and weakly - coupled dimer compounds,@xcite magnetization plateaux in frustrated magnets,@xcite and other new effects.@xcite it turned out that in many cases experimental data deviate significantly from the theoretical predictions based on the pure isotropic heisenberg model in external field.@xcite such deviations are due to anisotropies , most notably the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) anisotropy , which are usually small and often neglected from zero - field considerations . not only such anisotropies can induce qualitatively new effects , but also the strength of such effects seems to be significantly amplified by an external field . in particular , in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin-@xmath8 chains with the dm interaction spin excitation spectrum exhibits a gap @xmath9 in contrast with the pure heisenberg case where the spectrum remains gapless.@xcite thus , while usually treated as an insignificant contamination of the problem , the dm interaction can give rise to an interesting phenomena on its own .",
    "in the case of the 1d spin - chains an unusual field - dependence of the gap has been first documented experimentally@xcite and has received a theoretical explanation soon after that.@xcite for the higher - dimensional cases there is a recent theoretical expectation@xcite that the field - dependence of one of the gaps should be @xmath10 .",
    "however , such a behavior has not been observed in any known system yet .",
    "there is also a disagreement between the recent theoretical works@xcite in the low - field regime with the earlier low - field studies of the heisenberg@xmath11 dm problem.@xcite the latter works predict a non - zero gap and also weak ferromagnetism@xcite in zero field , while the former do not",
    ". we will show below that this discrepancy comes from the higher - order contributions , which yet result in the effects of order @xmath12 in the excitation gap and spin canting angle .",
    "we will also show that in a realistic system the low - field behavior can be more delicate .",
    "the field - dependence of the gap , quite generally , takes the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 can be both positive and negative depending on the system .",
    "this clarifies theoretical expectation for experiments .",
    "furthermore , most of the studies have excluded from consideration the quantum effects associated with the dm interaction .",
    "the generic question is : does the dm interaction enhance or suppress quantum fluctuations ?",
    "this is important for the systems close to the spin - liquid state , such as triangular lattice af cs@xmath4cucl@xmath15 where the dm term is significant,@xcite and also for the frustrated spin systems where quantum effects may help to select the ground state.@xcite    in this work we study the excitation spectrum and various @xmath16 static properties of the square lattice , spin-@xmath2 heisenberg model with the dm interaction .",
    "this is the simplest case of a higher - dimensional system in which generic trends of the mutual effect of the dm interaction , external field , and quantum fluctuations on the properties of an ordered af can be studied .",
    "this choice is also motivated , in part , by the recent experiments in k@xmath4v@xmath5o@xmath6 , a 2d , @xmath3 af , which demonstrates an unusual spin - reorientation transition in a small field.@xcite this effect has been understood as resulting from an interplay of the dm and easy - axis anisotropies .",
    "altogether , the purpose of this work is threefold .",
    "first , to reconcile the earlier low - field and recent high - field theoretical studies of the heisenberg@xmath11dm@xmath11field problem .",
    "second , to study the dependence of the quantum corrections on the dm interaction .",
    "third , to analyze an experimental system to which these results can be applied .",
    "we find that the gap in one of the magnon branches shows the following behavior when @xmath17 : @xmath18 in @xmath7 field , @xmath19 for @xmath20 , and @xmath21 for @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the saturation field and the energy units @xmath24 are used .",
    "these findings are in agreement with the other works.@xcite we also show that , for the fields @xmath25 , the dm interaction leads to the suppression of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the dependence of the quantum corrections on @xmath1 for various quantities is often non - analytic .",
    "it is only in the regime of the field close to the saturation , @xmath26 , where the dm term enhances quantum fluctuations , effectively leading to a proliferation of the quantum effects into the classical saturated phase ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we also show that some quantum corrections are singular in the limit of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 going to zero , namely @xmath28 .",
    "we demonstrate that k@xmath4v@xmath5o@xmath6 is an excellent candidate for the observation of the unusual field - dependence of the gap , characteristic to the 2d and 3d afs .",
    "in fact , an additional easy - axis anisotropy helps to switch between the ising - like and easy - plane behavior in this system , making it potentially possible to observe a non - analytic @xmath29 behavior of the gap.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ q_effects ] we describe the technical details , derive the spin - excitation spectrum , and present the results for the quantum corrections to various quantities in different field regimes . in sec .",
    "[ kvo ] we give a quantitative discussion of the excitation spectrum in k@xmath4v@xmath5o@xmath6 .",
    "we conclude by sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] which contains a brief discussion of our results .",
    "as is mentioned in introduction , we would like to consider the simplest possible case of an ordered af with the dm anisotropy in an external field , which would allow to investigate the role of quantum corrections in it .",
    "we therefore study the spin-@xmath2 , nearest - neighbor heisenberg model on a square lattice with the dm interaction : @xmath30 @xmath31 denotes summation over bonds and @xmath32 is the magnetic field in the energy units ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the direction of the ( staggered ) dm vector will be chosen along the @xmath34-axis , @xmath35 . aside from being the simplest and the most common@xcite choice , this hamiltonian also corresponds closely to k@xmath4v@xmath5o@xmath6.@xcite we would like to note that , generally , this form of the hamiltonian is incomplete , because , as noted in refs . , the same microscopic processes that generate the dm cross - product term also yield the higher - order @xmath36 terms , which contribute to some observables on equal footing .",
    "without going into much details we refer to the same works@xcite which show that these additional terms can be cast in the form of an easy - axis anisotropy with the `` easy '' axis along the @xmath37-vector , also the case realized in k@xmath4v@xmath5o@xmath6 .",
    "quite generally , the dm constant @xmath1 and the easy - axis anisotropy constant @xmath38 are not related to each other in a straightforward way and thus can be treated as phenomenological parameters .",
    "therefore , in the following we would like to concentrate on the most commonly used hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) which only contains the cross - product dm - term and will consider the effect of the easy - axis anisotropy later in the context of k@xmath4v@xmath5o@xmath6 , sec .",
    "it is convenient to use units @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) and this convention is used throughout the paper unless noted otherwise .",
    "it is important to discuss the classical limit of the model ( [ h ] ) first , as for the consideration of the excitation spectrum the quantization axes for spins will be chosen along their classical directions . the effect of the dm interaction is twofold : it makes energetically favorable for the spins to stay in the plane perpendicular to the direction of @xmath37 and , without the @xmath40-term , it would make the spins in different sublattices to be under an @xmath41 angle to each other ( in the notations of fig .",
    "[ angles ] that corresponds to the angle @xmath42 ) .",
    "while the former trend can only be hindered by additional anisotropies ( see next section ) the latter always competes with the much larger heisenberg term which prefers the spins to stay antiparallel .",
    "thus , at @xmath7 in the ground state of the model ( [ h ] ) spins lie in the @xmath43 plane and are canted towards each other . according to fig .",
    "[ angles ] this configuration has a finite angle @xmath44 resulting in a non - zero uniform magnetization @xmath45 ( per spin ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath7 limit of the model ( [ h ] ) exhibits an _ effective _ easy - plane anisotropy and a _ weak ferromagnetism _ , a phenomenon the dm interaction was originally proposed for.@xcite    it is clear now that there are two distinct choices for the direction of the external field : one is along the dm vector , @xmath46 , and the other one is perpendicular to it , @xmath47 .",
    "we will be mostly concerned with the latter case of the in - plane field as it leads to most non - trivial results and will only briefly discuss the former . from the symmetry point of view",
    "these two cases are clearly distinct because the symmetry is lowered by the dm interaction already in zero field from the full rotational @xmath48 symmetry to the easy - plane @xmath49 symmetry . then the field along the @xmath34-axis will only ca nt the spins towards itself without affecting the freedom of choice of the spontaneous in - plane spin direction , thus leaving @xmath49 intact .",
    "on the other hand , the in - plane field will break the remaining continuous @xmath49 symmetry and `` pin '' the spins direction in the plane .    _ canting angles at @xmath50 . _",
    "since the magnitude of the dm interaction is generally small one may wonder how much difference its presence makes for the ground state of the model ( [ h ] ) for the finite , and not necessarily small , values of @xmath0 . while we will address this issue in detail below",
    "it is instructive to consider the spin configuration when @xmath50 .",
    "if we neglect the dm interaction in ( [ h ] ) the only effect of the external magnetic field is to induce a finite uniform magnetization by canting spins towards the field .",

    "since all these experimental results were obtained at a finite temperature of the order of the nel ordering temperature for this material , the differences between the theoretical results and the data are to be expected . the closer agreement with the data for the spin - flop field are due to the first - order nature of that transition .",
    "it is known@xcite that the critical field for the spin - flop transition is only weakly temperature - dependent . for the spin - rotation transition ,",

    "our results for the field - dependence of the @xmath131 and @xmath167 gaps , both below and above the spin - rotation transition , together with the results for the dm - only ( @xmath289 ) case are shown in figures [ gapsab00 ] and [ gapsab ] , respectively .",
    "one can see that for the @xmath131 gap above the transition the results for k@xmath4v@xmath5o@xmath6 are essentially indistinguishable from the dm - only case .",

    "they scale as @xmath325 for the fields @xmath326 but diminish closer to the saturation field .",

    "saturation field for k@xmath4v@xmath5o@xmath6 is @xmath261t.,width=302 ]      for completeness , we briefly discuss here the case @xmath250 . in such a case",
    "the ground state and the spectrum field - dependencies are qualitatively the same as in the dm - only case ( [ h ] ) considered in secs . [ class ] and [ gaps ] .",
    "in fact , for the most interesting @xmath57 configuration the canting angle in the ground state is simply identical to eq .",
    "( [ phi1 ] ) because the easy - axis anisotropy is effectively switched - off . in particular , the zero - field ground state for @xmath250 possesses the same uniform magnetization as if the easy - axis term would be absent .",
    "interestingly enough , the high- and intermediate - field behavior of the @xmath105-gap also depends only on the dm - term , @xmath328 for @xmath149 . on the other hand ,",
    "the zero - field gap in this case is reduced : @xmath329 .",
    "thus , the zero - field canting angle @xmath330 is not in one - to - one correspondence anymore with the zero - field @xmath105-gap , in contrast to the dm - only case , model ( [ h ] ) .",
    "a particular case @xmath246 is also interesting as it shows no gap in zero - field , yet a finite - field behavior of the gap is governed by the dm - term : @xmath328 , the result obtained in refs . .",
    "another interesting feature of that case is that the classical energy in zero - field , eq .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) , is degenerate for any choice of @xmath56 , while @xmath331 .",
    "that is , the weak ferromagnetism with the uniform magnetization of an arbitrary strength from the range @xmath332 can occur in zero - field ground state as a result of the spontaneous choice of @xmath56 in the spin configuration depicted in fig .",
    "[ angles1 ] .",
    "this scenario has been also discussed on ref . .",
    "altogether , an additional easy - axis anisotropy introduces some new transitions in the physics of a realistic system in comparison with the dm - only case , but leaves most of the results for the field above the corresponding transition unchanged .",
    "that is , for the out - of - plane field configuration one of the gaps in the spin - wave spectrum behaves similarly to a uniform precession mode , @xmath333 , while the other mode stays gapless . for the in - plane field",
    "both modes are gapped .",
    "one of them is the uniform precession mode while the other depends non - analytically on the field and shows a non - trivial behavior in high field .",
    "we would like to note that some indications of such a drastically different behavior of the gaps for different field directions have been observed in the field - dependence of the thermal conductivity@xcite in k@xmath4v@xmath5o@xmath6 , see ref . .",
    "one of the crucial differences of the k@xmath4v@xmath5o@xmath6 spectrum field - dependence from the idealized dm - only case , eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , is the effective off - set of the field for the in - plane field direction , leading to the @xmath334 behavior of the gap .",
    "thus , in a realistic system , the low - field behavior of the dm - induced gap is more delicate than simple @xmath169 suggested recently.@xcite",
    "we conclude by summarizing our results . we have studied the effects of external field on the properties of an ordered heisenberg antiferromagnet with the dm interaction . utilizing the spin - wave theory",
    "we have calculated the quantum correction to the energy , on - site magnetization , and uniform magnetization v.s . @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we have shown that the spin - wave excitations exhibit an unusual field - evolution of the gaps which leads to various non - analytic dependencies of the quantum corrections .",
    "we have found that the gap in one of the magnon branches follows a particularly interesting behavior v.s .",
    "field for a specific field direction : @xmath167 is @xmath335 , @xmath219 , or @xmath336 depending on the field . a similar behavior is reflected in some of the quantum corrections as well .",
    "we have demonstrated that for the fields @xmath25 the dm interaction suppresses quantum fluctuations .",
    "the on - site ordered moment is affected most strongly by such a suppression .",
    "it is only in the regime of the field close to the saturation where the dm term enhances quantum fluctuations , effectively leading to a proliferation of the quantum effects into the classical saturated phase .",
    "we have shown that some quantum corrections are singular in the limit of @xmath337 .",
    "we also have considered k@xmath4v@xmath5o@xmath6 which is well described by the spin-@xmath8 , heisenberg af on the two - dimensional square lattice , with the additional dm and easy - axis anisotropies .",
    "we have demonstrated that k@xmath4v@xmath5o@xmath6 is an excellent candidate for the observation of the unusual field - dependence of the gaps , characteristic to the 2d and 3d afs .",
