    "thanks to the high - controllability of ultracold atoms in interatomic interaction , geometry , purity , atomic species and lattice constant ( of optical lattices ) , ultracold atomic gases have already become one of the most important footstones in modern physics , and can be used in simulating various strongly correlated many - body models in solid state physics @xcite .",
    "very recently , another controllability of ultracold atoms is realized experimentally , in which the spin degree of freedom of atoms ( i.e. , the atomic internal hyperfine states ) is coupled to the orbital degree of freedom ( i.e. , the momentum ) by using a two - photon raman process .",
    "this so - called spin - orbit ( so ) coupling was first created and detected in atomic @xmath2rb bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite , and then produced in atomic fermi gases of @xmath0k atoms @xcite and @xmath1li atoms @xcite .",
    "the realization of so coupled atomic gases enables the simulation of charged particles by using neutral atoms , which are cleaner and more controllable @xcite .",
    "these experiments open an entirely new way to study the celebrated effects of so coupling , such as topological insulators , topological superconductors and new exotic superfluid phases @xcite .",
    "radio - frequency ( rf ) spectroscopy has been widely applied in many experiments to study fermionic pairing in a two - component fermi gas near feshbach resonances when it crosses from a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid of weakly interacting cooper pairs over to a bec of tightly bound molecules @xcite , and also to investigate the properties of polarons in spin - imbalanced fermi gases @xcite .",
    "this technology allows a precise determination of the molecular binding energy @xcite and pairing gap in a degenerate fermi gas @xcite .",
    "in addition , the momentum - resolved rf spectroscopy , i.e. , the spectroscopy at a specific momentum , is also available @xcite and provides important information on low - energy excitations of novel exotic state of matter in ultracold atoms . in this respect",
    ", it would be a powerful tool for characterizing the recently realized spin - orbit coupled atomic fermi gases .",
    "indeed , momentum - resolved rf spectroscopy of _ non - interacting _ spin - orbit coupled @xmath0k and @xmath1li atoms has already been reported @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we aim to qualitatively predict the momentum - resolved rf spectroscopy of a _ resonantly interacting _ atomic fermi gas with equal rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling , a system already realized experimentally at shanxi university and also at mit by using broad feshbach resonances @xcite . as is well - known , a strongly interacting fermi gas near feshbach resonances is notoriously difficult to handle theoretically @xcite .",
    "therefore , at the _ qualitative _ level , we approximate the strongly interacting fermi gas as a mixture of non - interacting atoms and molecules . all the properties of individual molecules are determined from the two - particle solution of two - interacting atoms",
    ". our approximation may be justified at large temperatures well above the superfluid transition temperature @xmath3 , where molecules are formed below the feshbach resonance and have little correlations among themselves or with atoms .",
    "this is exactly the situation in current experiments , for instance , at shanxi university @xcite , the typical temperature of spin - orbit coupled @xmath0k atoms is now at about @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the fermi degenerate temperature .",
    "we consider separately the momentum - resolved rf - spectroscopy of atoms and of molecules .",
    "moreover , according to real experiments we take into account the crucial trapping potential that prevents the atoms and molecules from escaping . within local density approximation ( lda )",
    ", the trapped fermi cloud may be divided into many locally uniform subsystems . for each subsystem",
    ", we calculate the rf responses of the atomic and molecular components based on the one - particle and two - particle solutions of uniform systems and fermi s golden rule .",
    "we finally add up all the local contributions to determine the total momentum - resolved rf spectroscopy .",
    "we note that due to so coupling , weakly bound molecules with anisotropic mass and wavefunction may be formed @xcite .",
    "the bound to free rf transition of weakly bound molecules at rest has been predicted @xcite . in this work , we will consider the rf transition of weakly bound molecules at motion with arbitrary center - of - mass ( com ) momentum .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we consider the situation of current experiments , and introduce the model hamiltonian responsible for equal rashba and dresselhaus so coupling .",
    "in addition , we introduce the lda formulism and present the calculation for the chemical potential .",

    "as we anticipate , there are two branches in which one is relatively weaker than the other one .",
    "since the energy of the upper helicity state @xmath139 is larger than that of the lower helicity state @xmath140 , the atoms will occupy the lower helicity state first and then the upper one before the rf transition .",
    "thus , the initial atomic population of the lower helicity state should be larger .",

    "therefore , the contribution from two initial states could be well identified experimentally .",
    "we can also see that the gap between two branches becomes larger when the strength of the zeeman field increases .",
