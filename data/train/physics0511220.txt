    "in physics , universal laws in nature are extracted by analyzing empirical data , and various phenomena are explained by the laws . in econophysics ,",
    "economic phenomena are investigated by using this physical approach @xcite . from this point of view , recently a major progress has been made with the research in distributions of personal income or company size .",
    "more than a hundred years ago , it is well known that a cumulative number @xmath0 obeys a power - law for @xmath1 which is larger than a certain threshold @xmath2 : @xmath3 this power - law and the exponent @xmath4 are called pareto s law and pareto index , respectively @xcite . here",
    "@xmath1 is wealth , income , profits , assets , sales , the number of employees and etc .",
    "fujiwara et al .",
    "@xcite have explained this phenomenon by using the law of detailed balance and gibrat s law @xcite , which are observed in empirical data .",
    "the detailed balance is time - reversal symmetry : @xmath5 here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are two successive incomes , profits , assets , sales , etc , and @xmath8 is a joint probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "gibrat s law states that the conditional probability distribution of growth rate @xmath9 is independent of the initial value @xmath6 : @xmath10 here growth rate @xmath11 is defined as the ratio @xmath12 and @xmath9 is defined by using the pdf @xmath13 and the joint pdf @xmath14 as @xmath15 in the proof , they assume no model and only use these two underlying laws in empirical data .    below the threshold @xmath2",

    "@xcite , by employing profits data of japanese companies in 2002 and 2003 @xcite , gibrat s law ( [ gibrat ] ) is extended in the middle scale region as follows : @xmath16 where @xmath17 by combining extended gibrat s law ( [ rline1 ] )  ( [ mu ] ) with the detailed balance ( [ detailed balance ] ) , we have kinematically derived the following distribution function in the high and middle scale region uniformly @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "all these findings are enormously important for the progress of econophysics . above derivations are , however , valid only in the economic equilibrium where the detailed balance ( [ detailed balance ] ) holds . as the next step",
    ", the dynamics should be established . for this aim",
    ", we must investigate long - term economic data in which dynamical transitions are observed .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to obtain personal income or company size data for a long period .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , kaizoji has reported that the distribution of japanese land prices has similar features with one of personal income and company size .",
    "the database of the assessed value of land is available on the ministry of land , infrastructure and transport government of japanese world - wide web site @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the high scale region data on the assessed value of land in a 23-year period ( 1983  2005 ) in order to investigate the dynamical behavior . as a result",
    ", we obtain a dynamical equation which non - equilibrium economic systems should satisfy .",
    "in japan , land is a very important asset which is distinguished from building .",
    "the transition of land prices has a possibility to influence the economy .",
    "in fact , japanese economy experienced bubble term ( 1986  1991 ) caused by the abnormal rise of land prices .",
    "the assessed value of land indicates the standard land prices evaluated by ministry of land , infrastructure , and transport .",
    "the investigation is undertaken on each piece of land assessed once a year .",
    "we employ the database of the assessed value of land covering the 23-year period from 1983 to 2005 .",
    "the distributions of land prices are shown in fig .",
    "[ prebubbledistribution ] , [ bubbledistribution ] , [ afterbubbledistribution ] , [ staticdistribution ] and [ quasistaticdistribution ] .",
    "the number of data points of land prices increases gradually , because the database only contains data points which exist in the 2005 evaluation .    from fig .",
    "[ prebubbledistribution ]  [ quasistaticdistribution ] , the power - law is confirmed in the high scale region . for each year , we estimate pareto index @xmath4 in the range of land prices from @xmath20 to @xmath21 where pareto law holds approximately . annual change of pareto index @xmath4 from 1983 to 2005 is represented in fig .",
    "[ varyingparetoindex ] . in this period ,",
    "pareto index has changed annually .",
    "this means that the system is not in equilibrium and the detailed balance ( [ detailed balance ] ) does not hold .",
    "actually , the breakdown is observed in the scatter plot of all pieces of land assessed in the database ( fig .",
    "[ 86vs87 ] and [ 89vs90 ] for instance ) .",
    "there is no @xmath22 symmetry in fig .",
    "[ 86vs87 ] and [ 89vs90 ] obviously . on the other hand , the detailed balance ( @xmath22 symmetry )",
    "is observed approximately in fig .",
    "[ 83vs84 ] and [ 04vs05 ] for instance .    here",
    "we make a simple assumption that the symmetry of the joint pdf @xmath8 is represented as a regression line fitted by least - square method as follows @xmath23 the detailed balance ( [ detailed balance ] ) has the special symmetry , @xmath24 .",
    "for each scatter plot , we measure @xmath25 , @xmath26 and the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ dqb ] .    from this symmetry ( @xmath27 ) , we extend the detailed balance ( [ detailed balance ] ) to @xmath28 in this paper , we call this law the detailed quasi - balance .",
    "in this section , we derive the relation between the change of pareto index @xmath4 and @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ line ] ) by extending the detailed balance ( [ detailed balance ] ) to the detailed quasi - balance ( [ detailed quasi - balance ] ) .",
    "we assume gibrat s law in the high scale region , because the number of data points is insufficient to observe gibrat s law .    due to the relation of @xmath29 under the change of variables from @xmath30 to @xmath31 ,",
    "these two joint pdfs are related to each other , @xmath32 where we use a modified ratio @xmath33 . from this relation ,",
    "the detailed quasi - balance ( [ detailed quasi - balance ] ) is rewritten in terms of @xmath14 as follows : @xmath34 substituting the joint pdf @xmath14 for the conditional probability @xmath9 defined in eq .",
    "( [ conditional ] ) , the detailed quasi - balance is expressed as @xmath35 we have used gibrat s law in eq .",
    "( [ dqb and gibrat0 ] ) .    by expanding eq .",
    "( [ dqb and gibrat ] ) around @xmath36 , the following differential equation is obtained @xmath37 the solution is given by @xmath38 here we consider two power - law distributions @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which lead @xmath41 from eq .",
    "( [ handm ] ) and ( [ pareto0 ] ) , we identify that @xmath42 . on the other hand , by taking @xmath43 transformation , eq .",
    "( [ handm ] ) is rewritten as @xmath44 identifying that @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath47 .",
    "consequently the relation between @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath25 is expressed as @xmath50    this is the dynamical equation which non - equilibrium economic systems satisfy .",
    "we confirm that the empirical data satisfy this correlation in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the dynamical behavior of non - equilibrium system in the high scale region by employing data on the assessed value of land in 1983  2005 japan . by assuming the detailed quasi - balance ( [ detailed quasi - balance ] ) and gibrat s law ( [ gibrat ] ) , we have derived a relation between the change of pareto index and a symmetry in the detailed quasi - balance . the relation ( [ ratio2 ] )",
    "has been confirmed in the empirical data nicely . the result in this paper",
    "is considered to be applied to other long - term economic data .",
    "the equation ( [ ratio2 ] ) is the dynamical one which non - equilibrium systems satisfy .",
    "we should comment on two separations between @xmath25 and @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] .",
    "an abrupt jump of pareto index between 1985 and 1986 ( 2001 and 2002 ) is observed in fig .",
    "[ varyingparetoindex ] .",
    "this means that the system changes vigorously in this period , where the symmetry is not represented as eq .",
    "( [ line ] ) . nevertheless , the dynamical equation ( [ ratio2 ] ) is valid in almost all the other quasistatic periods .",
    "the finding in this paper is a first step to explain varying macro phenomena by using laws in non - equilibrium systems . for the next step",
    ", we should investigate the dynamical behavior in the middle scale region .",
