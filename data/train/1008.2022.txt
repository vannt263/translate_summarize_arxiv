    "experimental and theoretical studies of quasi - one dimensional ( quasi-1d ) magnets have flourished recently . on theoretical grounds ,",
    "such systems seem to experience low dimensionality combined with frustrated interactions of nearest - neighbors and next - nearest - neighbors competition , leading to spin density waves forming chiral order@xcite and other exotic ground states@xcite .",
    "experimentally , progress has accelerated due to recent use of high - pressure techniques @xcite , enabling synthesis of numerous compounds .",
    "such materials show remarkable physical behavior @xcite , where the nature behind these phenomena is governed by a strong spin - spin interaction along one direction combined with a much weaker interaction in the other directions .",
    "a novel quasi-1d spin system of particular interest is nav@xmath3o@xmath4 ( nvo)@xcite , which is isostructural with cav@xmath3o@xmath4 ( cvo)@xcite . unlike other vanadate compounds , which are spinels@xcite , nvo and cvo posses an orthorhombic structure with the _ pnma _ space group , where irregular hexagonal 1d channels are formed by a series of edge - sharing vo@xmath9 octahedra aligned along the @xmath10-axis .",
    "the magnetic v ions are thus arranged in a 1d @xmath0 chain . despite their closely related chemical and crystallographical nature",
    ", they exhibit dramatically different magnetic and electronic properties .",
    "the metallic nvo incorporates a mixed valence v@xmath11 state and undergoes an antiferromagnetic ( af ) transition at @xmath12  k , with a complex magnetic ground state@xcite .",
    "in fact , recent neutron studies indicate the formation of incommensurate magnetic order in nvo below @xmath13@xcite .",
    "the insulating cvo , on the other hand , has a v@xmath14 valence ( @xmath15 ) with an af transition at @xmath16  k , coexisting with intrachain ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "furthermore , the chemical substitution of na for ca causes an interesting insulator to metal transition at a critical na concentration @xmath17 in na@xmath1ca@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 ( ncvo ) .",
    "the presence of the insulator to metal transition suggests a dynamic change in the electronic structure of ncvo with @xmath8 , resulting in the change in its magnetic ground state .",
    "it is therefore desirable to systematically investigate the evolution of the microscopic magnetic order / disorder in ncvo .",
    "recently , through the use of positive muon - spin rotation and relaxation ( @xmath18sr ) , we found the formation of static af order for a few ncvo compounds below their @xmath19 and proposed a magnetic phase diagram@xcite .",
    "@xmath18sr is known to be a powerful technique for studies on microscopic magnetic nature in solids , due to its inherent 100% spin polarization and local sensitivity .",
    "the most interesting feature in ncvo is the unusual coexistence of af order and metallic behaviour below @xmath19 for ncvo with @xmath20 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is , therefore , to clarify the microscopic magnetic ground state of the entire ncvo family through the use of @xmath18sr and numerical simulations based on dipolar field calculations .",
    "this is , to our knowledge , a pioneering attempt to deduce the incommensurate modulation period _ from _",
    "@xmath18sr data .",
    "we also seek to complete the magnetic phase diagram of ncvo by additional @xmath18sr measurements on insulating and metallic ncvo samples with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which were not described in our previous report .",
    "our results reveal that the magnetic ground state in the insulating compounds with @xmath23 are also an incommensurate magnetically ordered phase .",
    "this means that not only pure cav@xmath3o@xmath4 but also the complete family of ncvo exhibit incommensurate magnetic order at low @xmath24 , concurrent with the change of the valence state of the v ion from 3 to 3.5 with increasing @xmath8 . this could provide a very interesting challenge for theorists : to predict the magnetic phase diagram of this @xmath0 chain compounds",
    "polycrystalline samples of ncvo were prepared by a solid - state reaction technique under a pressure of 6  gpa using cav@xmath3o@xmath4 , na@xmath4v@xmath3o@xmath25 , and v@xmath3o@xmath26 powders as starting materials .",
    "a mixture of the three powders was packed in an au capsule , then heated at 1300@xmath27c for 1 hour , and finally quenched to ambient @xmath24 .",
    "a powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) analysis showed that all the samples were almost single phase with an orthorhombic system , @xmath28 space group , at ambient @xmath24 .",
    "dc-@xmath29 measurements showed that all our samples have almost the same @xmath24 dependence as that in the previous report @xcite .",
    "the preparation and characterization of the samples have been reported in greater detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18sr measurements were carried out on the m20 surface muon beamline with the lampf spectrometer at triumf , the canada s national laboratory for particle and nuclear physics located in vancouver , canada , which provides a highly intense , polarized beam of positive muons . the samples , 13 polycrystalline discs with 6  mm diameter and 5  mm thickness of ncvo , were mounted on the sample holder for the muon veto cryostat insert @xcite by mylar - tape .",
    "weak transverse field @xmath18sr ( wtf-@xmath18sr ) and zero field @xmath18sr ( zf-@xmath18sr ) spectra were measured in a non - spin - rotated mode i.e. , the initial muon - spin direction is anti - parallel to the muon momentum direction . here , ",
    "weak \" means that the applied field is significantly less than any possible spontaneous internal fields ( @xmath30 ) in the ordered state .",
    "a wtf-@xmath18sr technique is sensitive to local magnetic order through the @xmath18 spin polarization amplitude .",
    "in contrast , zf-@xmath18sr is a sensitive probe of local magnetic [ dis]order through the precession of the muon due to internal magnetic fields at the muon interstitial sites .",
    "in the inset of fig .",
    "[ rawtf](b ) we show the typical wtf asymmetry ( @xmath31 ) represented here by the @xmath32 sample at two temperatures , above and below @xmath19 . in the paramagnetic state , at high temperatures ( @xmath33  k ) , the muon - spin precess at the frequency corresponding to the external transverse field @xmath34  oe . below @xmath19 , @xmath31 decreases , due to the strong static internal magnetic fields , @xmath30 , obeying @xmath35 .",
    "the remaining oscillating amplitude , shown in the figure , reflects the portion of muons not coupled to @xmath30 , thus the fraction of the wtf oscillatory signal below @xmath13 is negligibly small for the magnetic nature of these compounds .",
    "the wtf spectrum is well described by an exponentially relaxing cosine oscillation ;    @xmath36\\cos(\\omega_{\\rm tf } t+\\phi ) , \\label{tfeq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 with @xmath38  khz / oe .",
    "the fit is represented by the solid lines in the inset of fig .",
    "[ rawtf](b ) .",
    "figure  [ rawtf](a ) depicts the temperature dependence of the normalized @xmath31 , @xmath39 , which is proportional to the fraction of the paramagnetic regions in the sample . in ncvo , we find two distinct af phases ; one occurs as na concentration increases up to @xmath40 and the transition temperature , @xmath19 decreases , the second occurs with @xmath41 , as the na concentration increases @xmath19 takes a sharp turn and increases to higher and higher temperatures with increasing @xmath8 above @xmath42  k. these observations are summarized in fig .  [ rawtf](b ) which plots @xmath13 versus the na concentration @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath13 is found at the middle of the transition and the errors on @xmath13 are taken as @xmath43 of the transition temperature width . since the @xmath44 and @xmath45 samples do not experience a sharp magnetic transition , we find these samples to be a mixture of phases .",
    "additionally , we can indicate that a critical doping level @xmath46 separates the two phases .",
    "however , we wish to emphasize that both bulk magnetization measurements and x - ray diffraction analysis show that each of these samples is almost a single phase with an orthorhombic structure@xcite .",
    "this clearly indicates the importance of the current microscopic measurements , which show results quite different from the macroscopic bulk measurements .",
    "we now explore the two af phases , identified by the wtf-@xmath18sr measurements , using the zf-@xmath18sr technique .",
    "the zf-@xmath18sr is a sensitive site - based probe of static magnetism , in which the time dependent muon polarization signal is determined exclusively by the @xmath30 s in the sample .",
    "we expect that different magnetic phases would cause different @xmath30s , resulting in different muon frequencies .",
    "therefore , following upon the wtf measurements , we performed detailed zf measurements for the entire @xmath8 range . in the @xmath48 range , we concentrate on the low @xmath24 behaviour , where the af transition occurs for @xmath49  k. in contrast , for the @xmath50 samples , we examine a broad @xmath24 range below 150  k.    before discussing our current results in ncvo , we briefly summarize the zf-@xmath18sr results of pure cvo@xcite .",
    "the cvo zf-@xmath18sr spectra indicated four temperature dependent frequencies below the af transition , two of which have significant amplitudes . in order to clarify the ground state",
    ", dipolar field calculations suggested that af order exists along the two 1d legs in the @xmath0 chain , and af order between the @xmath0 chains .",
    "this result was found to be consistent with neutron measurements both for @xmath30 s and the magnitude of the ordered v moment .",
    "the typical raw zf - spectrum , represented by the @xmath32 sample , taken at @xmath51  k is depict in the inset of fig .",
    "one can clearly see a strongly damped oscillation in the early time domain , @xmath52s , at the lowest @xmath24 measured . in order to fit the spectrum ,",
    "we , at first , attempted to apply a combination of an exponentially relaxing cosine signal and a slowly relaxing signal .",
    "the former corresponds to the static af ordered signal , and the latter does to the  1/3 \" tail for the powder sample : @xmath53    although the zf - spectrum was reasonably fitted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : zfeq1 ] ) , the initial phase ( @xmath54 ) delays by @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the @xmath32 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 samples .",
    "since @xmath54 should be zero for a simple commensurate af order , the delay indicates either a wide distribution of @xmath30 or a formation of an incommensurate ( ic ) af order .",
    "in fact , the fourier transform ( ft ) of the zf time - spectrum in @xmath60 clearly demonstrates the wide field distribution at the muon sites [ see the main panel of fig .",
    "[ lowx ] as an example of the @xmath32 sample ] .",
    "the ft spectrum also indicates the presence of a shoulder on the higher frequency side , suggesting the formation of complex magnetic order .",
    "indeed , the zf - spectrum is better fitted by a zeroth - order bessel function of the first kind [ @xmath61 ) ] , especially in explaining the fast relaxing behaviour in the early time domain ( before 0.02  @xmath62s ) . a zf - spectrum described by @xmath63",
    "is well established signature that the @xmath18 s experience an ic magnetic field in the lattice @xcite .",
    "hence , the zf-@xmath18sr spectra at low @xmath24 were fitted with a combination of two signals ; @xmath64 the fit is demonstrated by the solid line in the inset of fig .",
    "[ lowx ] . in fig .",
    "[ zfsdw](a ) , we plot the frequency @xmath65 , extracted from the fits , versus @xmath24 . for all @xmath66 , as @xmath24 increases",
    ", @xmath67 decreases with an increasing slope ( d@xmath67/d@xmath24 ) and approaches zero at @xmath19 .",
    "interestingly , as indicated in fig .",
    "3b , the normalized @xmath67 [ @xmath68 and the reduced @xmath24 ( @xmath69 ) are independent of @xmath8 [ see fig.[zfsdw](b ) ] . in fact",
    ", the @xmath70-vs.-@xmath71 curves now collapse to a single universal curve , indicating the same origin of the ic transition .",
    "this universal curve is well explained by the @xmath24 dependence of the bcs gap energy , as expected for the order parameter of the ic - af state @xcite@xcite .",
    "this was recently found by a @xmath72v nmr study , which suggested an ic afm for @xmath73@xcite ( note that af resonance lines in the metallic phase were observed in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we therefore find that the ic phase in the insulating region includes all compounds , at low @xmath24 .",
    "the transverse relaxation rate , @xmath74 , shows typical critical behavior as @xmath75 , namely , @xmath74 increases with increasing @xmath24 up to @xmath13 as expected @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal relaxation rate , @xmath76 , can in principle reveal whether frustration prevents the system from reaching the full static limit , as observed in some highly frustrated systems : normally one expects @xmath77 ( static limit ) as @xmath78 .",
    "however , @xmath76 is very small ( @xmath79s@xmath80 ) compared with @xmath74 and difficult to determine reliably , especially in the presence of several signals , hence we can not make a confident statement .",
    "the ft of the whole @xmath8 range , at @xmath82  k , is presented in fig .",
    "[ raw10to12a ] .",
    "clearly , the zf measurements of the metallic compounds , i.e. , @xmath81 samples , reveal different behavior than those at smaller x. unlike the insulating compounds , the metallic compounds , display multiple frequencies ( two in @xmath83 , four in @xmath84 ) , forming one frequency at higher @xmath24 and vanishing above the phase transition ( not shown ) .",
    "therefore , the zf - spectra for these compounds were fitted by a sum of four oscillating signals with a slow exponential relaxation , @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and @xmath88 are the angular frequency , the initial phase , and the relaxation rate of the @xmath89-th muon precession , @xmath90 and @xmath76 are the asymmetry and the relaxation rate for the  1/3 tail \" signal@xcite , as we measured powder samples .",

    "we note that at @xmath94  k two frequencies are distinguished , but at @xmath95  k a single frequency is observed . in @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) ,",
    "the number of frequencies is decreased from 4 , at @xmath94k to 2 ( 3 ) and then to one frequency .",
    "recent neutron scattering measurements suggests that a small displacement of o@xmath98 ions , which leads to a change in the muon sites@xcite is the trigger to this intermediate phase .",
    "this scenario was also proposed in other compounds@xcite .",
    "one of the distinctive features in this @xmath8 range , are two common frequencies . at base @xmath24 , @xmath99mhz and @xmath100mhz",
    "are @xmath8 independent . as in the insulating phase , by plotting the frequency versus the reduced temperature results in the collapse of these frequencies to a single curve , suggesting the ic afm in this phase as well .",
    "[ raw10to12b](b ) demonstrates this for @xmath101 . in the next section",
    "we aim to find the correct spin configuration which produces this behavior .",

    "we now address the origin of the 4 frequencies observed in metallic phase using computer simulations .",
    "we aim to fit the raw experimental data with a minimal number of free parameters .",
    "we use the known crystallographic structure in order to create the simulated crystal model@xcite .",
    "we then find all possible muon sites in the sample using electrostatic potential calculations@xcite .",
    "indeed the model finds 4 distinct muon sites , which was also seen previously in the pure nvo@xcite . the next step was to find the correct spin configuration which results in the fields which give the muon precession measured in each site .",
    "hence , dipolar fields were calculated with different independent alignments of the af moments of the two @xmath0 chains , residing in the @xmath105 plane .",
    "the simulation also probed different ic helical modulations , that is the magnetic moment size at the @xmath106 unit cell is @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the propagation vector along @xmath102 and @xmath109 is the v moment size , which is the only free parameter , and is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "we average over degenerate states obtained by the simulation in order to accurately describe this model .",
    "we use @xmath104 criteria as a crude guide in selecting the potential realized state . for comparison",
    ", we also performed the same calculation for a linear ic spin density wave , which is proposed by neutron measurements@xcite .",
    "however , as seen in table i , @xmath104 for a linear ic - sdw model was always higher than a helical - modulated setup . figure  [ simulation](a ) displays the experimental zf - spectrum of nvo taken at @xmath82  k with the simulated spectrum assuming both the helical and linear configuration .",
    "we find that the best fit to the experimental data is , thus , a configuration with an helical ic modulation along @xmath102 axis .",
    "table [ simtable ] summarizes the simulation results and shows the propagation vector @xmath110 versus @xmath8 and the @xmath104 goodness - of - fit to the @xmath82  k experimental data of these compounds .",
    "the value of nvo is found to be very consistent with that obtained by the recent neutron experiment@xcite , namely , the modulation period is @xmath111 along the @xmath10-axis .",
    "however , the powder neutron diffraction result does not suggests a helical ic order but rather a linear ic - sdw order in nvo .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not clear .",
    "we speculate that the since the neutron result was obtained from powder samples through the rietveld analyses , and the result published may be that of a local minima .",
    "secondly , it might be that the dipolar field alone , which do not take into account crystal fields might not be fully appropriate to describe such a subtle magnetic state .",
    "in fact , a helical ic ordered state is more reasonable in explaining the coexistence of the af order and metallic conductivity below @xmath13 for nvo .",
    "hence , @xmath18sr is found to play a significant role to determine the af structure in ncvo . in fig .",

    "af2 and af3 describes the low temperature af order characterized by 4 frequencies occurring in the @xmath116 .",
    "we therefore updated the previously published phase diagram@xcite with the introduction of @xmath32 , identified the ic phase at @xmath66 , as well as the new data on @xmath117 shed additional light on the multiple af phases .",
    "in summary , @xmath62sr measurements on the na@xmath118ca@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 family reveal a diverse number of magnetic phases for different @xmath8 .",

    "<S> we present muon - spin rotation measurements on polycrystalline samples of the complete family of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) @xmath0 chain compounds , na@xmath1ca@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 . in this family , we explore the magnetic properties from the metallic nav@xmath3o@xmath4 to the insulating cav@xmath3o@xmath4 . we find a critical @xmath5 which separates the low and high na - concentration dependent transition temperature and its magnetic ground state . in the @xmath6 compounds , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic ordered phase is characterized by a single homogenous phase and the formation of incommensurate spin - density - wave order . </S>",
    "<S> whereas in the @xmath7 compounds , multiple sub - phases appear with temperature and @xmath8 . based on the muon data obtained in zero external magnetic field , a careful dipolar field simulation was able to reproduce the muon behavior and indicates a modulated helical incommensurate spin structure of the metallic af phase . </S>",
    "<S> the incommensurate modulation period obtained by the simulation agrees with that determined by neutron diffraction . </S>"
