    "standard correlation measures like the pearson correlation coefficient and the cross - correlation function require stationary data in order to provide reliable results , which is a requirement that is hard to fulfill in many real - world situations ( the financial and physiological data are the negative examples here  @xcite ) .",
    "( by stationarity we mean stability of the probability distribution functions of the data over time ; from this perspective nonstationarity can be produced both by the long - range autocorrelations and by the pdf s heavy tails that make any signal length effectively insufficient . )",
    "this problem can to some degree be resolved by replacing original signals with the corresponding detrended fluctuations , i.e. by considering the power - law correlations between the polynomially detrended walks , which are much more stationary than the orginal data .",
    "this approach was introduced in a context of autocorrelations in  @xcite as the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) and immediately gained popularity among the researchers working with empirical data across many disciplines .",
    "the modification of dfa oriented towards detection of the power - law cross - correlations is known as the detrended cross - correlation analysis ( dcca )  @xcite and it can be used in analysis of bivariate and multivariate empirical data  @xcite .    among the reasons behind the popularity of dfa",
    "was its ability of detecting fractal character of signals , which was subsequently extended to the multifractal case ( the mfdfa method  @xcite ) , which also proved very useful if applied to empirical data  , especially owing to its superior reliability if compared to other methods  @xcite .",
    "dcca was also generalized in order to be applicable to signals with multifractal cross - correlations and the resulting mfdcca / mfdxa algorithm  @xcite also attracted some attention  @xcite .",
    "however , this generalization raises controversy as at some stage it requires to neglect the detrended covariance sign to avoid obtaining complex values , which leads to inevitable loss of information about analyzed signals and , consequently , to incorrect results  @xcite .",
    "this drawback has recently been removed with a new sign - sensitive method of the multifractal detrended cross - correlation analysis with an acronym mfcca  @xcite that is more consistent than mfdcca as a multifractal generalization of dcca ( for more details see section ii ) .",
    "although the dfa and dcca methods were designed to deal with nonstationary signals , they are related to each other exactly in the same way as the variance and the covariance analyses are related to each other in the case of stationary data .",
    "therefore , by exploiting both these methods , an analogue of the pearson coefficient was introduced .",
    "it is known as the detrended cross - correlation coefficient @xmath0  @xcite and serves as a tool for quantifying strength of correlations in the fluctuations of detrended signals at a given time scale  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of @xmath0 over the pearson coefficient is its ability to quantify correlations in nonstationary signals  @xcite .",
    "what is important is that the signals under study may either be fractal or non - fractal since @xmath0 is defined for a single scale .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that there is a counterpart of @xmath0 constructed for the detrended moving average cross - correlation analysis ( dmca )  @xcite but considering it here exceeds the objectives of this work .    by definition ,",
    "the detrended cross - correlation coefficient is insensitive to higher - order statistics of fluctuations , i.e. , other than the simple covariance .",
    "this means that values of @xmath0 can not indicate whether the detected cross - correlations between two signals originate from the fluctuations of all amplitudes equally likely or rather some specific range of amplitudes gives a dominant contribution , while the remaining fluctuations can be much less correlated or even completely uncorrelated .",
    "one might easily imagine situations , in which such insensitivity can be considered a serious disadvantage of the method . for instance",
    ", let each nonstationary signal in a pair be a mixture of two processes , one of which is correlated in both signals and has a relatively small amplitude , while the other is unique to each signal and has a relatively high amplitude .",
    "the coefficient @xmath0 would probably indicate that the signals are somehow cross - correlated but it would not bring any information allowing one to identify the amplitude of the cross - correlated components .    in order to avoid such insensitivity , here we propose a generalization of the detrended cross - correlation coefficient in such a way that it becomes sensitive to correlations in the fluctuations of a selected amplitude range .",
    "the easiest way to do this is by introducing a @xmath2-dependent detrended cross - correlation coefficient @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) based on the so - called @xmath2-dependent fluctuation functions @xmath4 from mfdfa and mfcca  @xcite .",
    "the idea is based on the fact that from a number of different values contibuting to a sum , one can select specific values ( e.g. , the large , the medium , or the small ones ) by rising all the values in the sum to some power ( high positive , small positive , or negative one , respectively ) . like @xmath0 , the coefficient @xmath1 is not related to fractal properties of signals so it can be used to quantify cross - correlations between any signals .",
    "as by its definition @xmath1 is intended to be a tool for analyzing nonstationary signals , we expect that it can find broad applications in the studies of empirical data from natural complex systems : physical , biological , social , financial , etc . in the remaining part of the paper",
    ", we present the formal definition of @xmath1 ( section ii ) , show examples of how it works if applied to the computer - generated signals representing different stochastic processes ( section iii ) and to empirical data from the financial markets ( section iv ) , and finally present the main conclusions ( section v ) .",
    "a fundamental quantity for the detrended fluctuation analysis as well as for any type of its derivative methods is the variance ( covariance ) @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) of the detrended signals @xmath7 ( @xmath8 stands for either @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) .",
    "let us consider a pair of time series @xmath11 and @xmath12 divided into @xmath13 separate boxes of length @xmath14 ( i.e. , @xmath15 boxes starting from the opposite ends ) .",
    "a detrending procedure consists of calculating in each box @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) the residual signals @xmath7 equal to the difference between the integrated signals and the @xmath18th - order polynomials @xmath19 fitted to these signals : @xmath20 in the present work we use @xmath21 .",

    "the above definitions are reduced to a simpler form : @xmath28 that may be interpreted as an average covariance and average variances for the boxes of size @xmath14 . in the standard application of the fluctuation functions in mfdfa and mfcca",
    ", one observes the dependence of @xmath29 and @xmath30 on the scale @xmath14 and looks for a convincing scaling behavior : @xmath31^{1/q } \\sim s^{\\gamma(q)}$ ] and/or @xmath32^{1/q } \\sim s^{\\delta(q)}$ ] , which indicates a fractal structure of the signals ( monofractal for the constant functions : @xmath33 and @xmath34 , multifractal otherwise ) .    the structure of eqs .",
    "( [ eq::covariance ] ) and ( [ eq::variance ] ) , which resembles the ordinary covariance and variance , respectively , suggested one to introduce the detrended cross - correlation coefficient  @xcite : @xmath35 owing to its normalized range of values  @xcite : @xmath36 with @xmath37 in the case of uncorrelated signals , @xmath38 in the case of a perfect cross - correlation , and @xmath39 in the case of a perfect anticorrelation , the coefficient @xmath40 can be used to quantify the strength of cross - correlations between the detrended signals @xmath7 on different scales @xmath14 and to compare this strength among different signal pairs  @xcite .",

    "this means that , by using solely the coefficient @xmath0 , it is impossible to observe how the boxes that are characterized by the fluctuations of a specific amplitude range contribute to the overall cross - correlations . the following definition of a new @xmath2-dependent detrended cross - correlation ( @xmath2dcca ) coefficient @xmath42 allows one to overcome this constraint : @xmath43 as the real exponent @xmath2 plays the role of a respective filter here . for @xmath27 we restore the definition ( [ eq::rho.dcca ] ) of @xmath0 , for @xmath44 the boxes with high values of @xmath26 and @xmath41 contribute to @xmath42 the most , while for @xmath45 the boxes with relatively small values do it the most significantly .",

    "in this section we present examples of the application of the new coefficient @xmath1 to the computer - generated time series representing different stochastic processes , in which the cross - correlations can fully be controlled , and then we discuss the performance of the coefficient in those cases .",
    "since @xmath1 is oriented towards analysis of nonstationary data , we prefer to employ stochastic models that produce signals with long memory and/or heavy - tailed probability distribution functions",
    ". long memory , which produces trends , and heavy tails of the fluctuations p.d.f.s , which can produce apparent trends , are the principal sources of nonstationarity in data from natural complex systems , therefore their presence in the model signals is highly desired .",
    "we focus on two models : the autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average ( arfima ) and the markov - switching multifractal ( msm ) .",
    "the former produces fractal signals with long memory and , despite its origin in financial economics  @xcite , it is broadly used to model anomalous diffusion in various fields of science , like atmosphere physics and geophysics  @xcite , astrophysics  @xcite , biology and physiology  @xcite , and many other .",

    "we showed that @xmath1 is able to identify correctly specific cross - correlations that remain undetected by the standard dcca cross - correlation coefficient @xmath0 as well as it is able to distinguish between the processes whose detrended fluctuations are cross - correlated in different amplitude ranges @xmath158 a task that is infeasible with @xmath0 .",

    "straightforward and likely fruitful for a more global correlation analysis would be to form the @xmath2-dependent counterparts of the conventional correlation matrices for larger sets of multivariate data and to study their spectral properties as it is commonplace in the standard correlation matrix analysis .",

    "<S> the detrended cross - correlation coefficient @xmath0 has recently been proposed to quantify the strength of cross - correlations on different temporal scales in bivariate , non - stationary time series . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the detrended cross - correlation and detrended fluctuation analyses ( dcca and dfa , respectively ) and can be viewed as an analogue of the pearson coefficient in the case of the fluctuation analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath0 works well in many practical situations but by construction its applicability is limited to detection of whether two signals are generally cross - correlated , without possibility to obtain information on the amplitude of fluctuations that are responsible for those cross - correlations . in order to introduce some related flexibility , </S>",
    "<S> here we propose an extension of @xmath0 that exploits the multifractal versions of dfa and dcca : mfdfa and mfcca , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting new coefficient @xmath1 not only is able to quantify the strength of correlations , but also it allows one to identify the range of detrended fluctuation amplitudes that are correlated in two signals under study . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the coefficient @xmath1 works in practical situations by applying it to stochastic time series representing processes with long memory : autoregressive and multiplicative ones . </S>",
    "<S> such processes are often used to model signals recorded from complex systems and complex physical phenomena like turbulence , so we are convinced that this new measure can successfully be applied in time series analysis . in particular , we present an example of such application to highly complex empirical data from financial markets . the present formulation can straightforwardly be extended to multivariate data in terms of the @xmath2-dependent counterpart of the correlation matrices and then to the network representation . </S>"
