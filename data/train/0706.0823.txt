    "the adiabatic loading of ultracold atoms and molecules in optical lattices represents a formidable opportunity to engineer strongly correlated states of quantum many - body systems with unprecedented control @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "known fundamental models for the physics of solid state systems can be literally implemented in optical lattices @xcite , and the experimental detection of their ground state or thermal equilibrium properties has the potential of responding to the lack of theoretical results due to fundamental limitations in the calculations , as those generally reported in fermionic systems or in frustrated quantum magnets . on the other hand , optical lattice systems offer the further advantage of controlling the hamiltonian parameters in real time , and this enriches the range of correlated phases that can be implemented , if one can guide the evolution of the system towards an off - equilibrium state which is not necessarily an eigenstate of a known hamiltonian .",
    "an intense activity has recently been focused on the experimental implementation of disorder potentials in systems of trapped ultracold bosons , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the introduction of tunable randomness in the system offers the possibility of realizing anderson localization of coherent matter waves of weakly interacting bosons @xcite and the opportunity of investigating the interplay between strong localization and strong interaction , _",
    "e.g. _ in a deep optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the fundamental model describing this rich phenomenology in presence of a lattice is the bose - hubbard model in a random potential @xcite , where , beside the conventional mott insulating and superfluid phases , a bose - glass phase appears , either associated with the fragmentation of weakly repulsive bosons into exponentially localized states , or with the localization of collective gapless modes for strong repulsion .",
    "the disorder potential has so far been realized optically , either through laser speckles @xcite with or without an optical lattice , or , in optical lattices , through a secondary incommensurate standing wave @xcite . in the case of speckles ,",
    "the typical length scale associated with the disorder potential is quite extended with respect to the correlation length of the bosons , so that classical trapping rather than quantum localization is responsible for the observed suppression of transport properties @xcite . on the other hand , the incommensurate superlattice of ref",
    ".   realizes a potential which is strongly fluctuating over the distance of a few lattice sites , but its _ pseudo_-disordered nature requires to take also into account gapped insulating phases at incommensurate fillings , competing with the bose glass @xcite .",
    "an alternative proposal to create disorder in optical lattices involves the repulsive interaction with a secondary species of particles @xcite .",
    "if the two species correspond to two different hyperfine states of the atoms , the use of state - dependent optical lattices @xcite allows one to first decouple the two species , and then to selectively suppress the hopping of one of them , freezing it in a given quantum state @xmath0 .",
    "if the two species are subsequently brought into interaction , the mobile one evolves in a quantum superposition of all possible realizations of the random potential associated with the fock components of @xmath0 , and expectation values over the evolved state are therefore automatically averaged over the disorder distribution @xcite . in this proposal not only is the disorder potential strongly fluctuating over the length scale of a few lattice sites , but in principle one can also vary its statistics by preparing the frozen bosons in different states @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the above proposal in detail in the exactly solvable case of a one - dimensional gas of hardcore bosons on a lattice @xcite .",
    "we consider both species of bosons ( the mobile one and the frozen one ) to be hardcore repulsive , which is not only experimentally feasible @xcite , but it has three fundamental theoretical advantages : 1 ) the state @xmath0 of the frozen bosons can be obtained exactly from the hamiltonian of the system before freezing , and disorder averaging can therefore be accurately performed ; 2 ) jordan - wigner diagonalization @xcite allows to calculate the exact real - time evolution of the mobile particles @xcite after they are brought into interaction with the frozen ones ; 3 ) and , most importantly from a conceptual point of view , localization phenomena of hardcore bosons are perfectly understood in terms of anderson localization of non - interacting fermions . while the observation of localization for interacting bosons is limited by screening of the disorder potential and the reduction of the healing length due to the interaction@xcite , many - body effects enter the system of non - interacting fermions only through fermi statistics .",
    "in particular we focus on the case in which the frozen bosons are initially prepared in the superfluid ground state @xmath0 of the hardcore - boson hamiltonian at _ half _ filling with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the resulting disorder potential has the structure of a bimodal random on - site energy , with algebraically decaying correlations , but also with a very rich fourier spectrum dominated by short - wavelength components .",
    "most importantly , such a potential is found to lead to anderson localization of all single - particle eigenstates ( apart from possibly a set of zero measure ) as expected for uncorrelated disorder @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the mobile bosons in such a potential is found to invariably lead to a disordered steady state with exponentially decaying correlations and absence of quasi - condensation for a wide variety of realistic initial conditions . in particular phenomena of quasi - condensation in finite - momentum states",
    "@xcite and fermionization @xcite , reported upon expansion of the hardcore bosons from a mott - insulating state and a superfluid state respectively , are completely washed out by the disorder potential .",
    "hence we can conclude that this setup allows for a robust implementation of a localized state as the off - equilibrium steady state of the system evolution .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section [ system and method ] describes the system of two bosonic species , the exact diagonalization method for the study of real - time evolution , the monte carlo sampling of the disorder distribution , and the main features of the random potential ; section [ ground state properties ] is devoted to the study of localization of the single - particle eigenstates in the random potential ; section [ single trap ] investigates the evolution of the mobile bosons after interaction with the frozen ones when both species are prepared on a ring ; finally , section [ transport properties ] is dedicated to the study of the expansion of the mobile bosons in the random potential , starting from different initial confined states .",
    "in this section we present the system of two bosonic species which is used to study the effect of a disorder potential ( subsection [ hamiltonian dynamics ] ) .",

    "numerical calculations based on a matrix - product - state representation of the system state also enjoy this feature of `` quantum parallelism '' of the hamiltonian evolution @xcite by treating the disorder potential as a quantum variable in the system .",
    "in this paper we use the more traditional approach of exactly calculating the ground - state properties and the hamiltonian evolution of hardcore bosons for a single realization of disorder at a time , averaging then over the disorder distribution through monte carlo importance sampling . accepting the overhead of disorder averaging",
    ", this approach has the advantage that , unlike the method of ref .  , the time evolution is exact for arbitrarily long times .    according to eq .  , the weights of the disorder configurations are defined by the coefficients of the fock - state decomposition for the initial state of the frozen bosons through @xmath70 . introducing the bosonic fock state @xmath71 and the @xmath72 matrix @xmath73 , after some algebra we get @xmath74    the energy eigenstates of noninteracting fermions with periodic boundary conditions , contained in the columns of the @xmath75 matrix ,",
    "are given by plain waves .",

    "hence we opt for monte carlo importance sampling , where starting from an initially chosen random configuration @xmath33 , we propose a new one @xmath80 ( e.g. by swapping the occupation of two sites ) and accept it with metropolis probability @xmath81 .",
    "the real - space properties are typically averaged over @xmath82 disorder realizations , obtained one from the other by updating @xmath83 sites , while the opdm is averaged over @xmath84 realizations ( due to the computational overhead of the opdm calculation ) .",
    "this provides full convergence of the disorder - averaged quantities .      a fundamental figure of merit for the proposed setup to introduce disorder in optical lattices is represented by the correlation properties of the disorder potential generated by the frozen particles .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the aspect of correlations represents one of the main weaknesses of the optical implementation of disorder through laser speckles @xcite .",
    "in particular , we focus on the density - density correlation function @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "this correlation function for the frozen hardcore bosons is identical to the one for the corresponding fermions , and can be calculated exactly in the homogeneous system ( @xmath87 ) with periodic boundary conditions ; for @xmath88 , namely in the superfluid state of hardcore bosons , @xmath89^{-1 } \\frac{\\sin^2\\bigl(\\pi\\frac{n^{\\rm f}r}{l}\\bigr)}{\\sin^2\\bigl(\\pi\\frac{r}{l}\\bigr)}&\\mbox{for } r\\ge 1\\\\ \\end{cases}\\ ] ] hence , in the limit @xmath90 ( which is always satisfied in the thermodynamic limit ) the correlator decays algebraically like @xmath91 with a superimposed oscillation at twice the fermi wavevector @xmath92 .",
    "the negative values of the correlator can be understood as resulting from an effective long - range repulsion between the hardcore bosons due to the kinetic energy , which enjoys as much free space around each boson as possible .    from eq .",
    "we deduce that the disorder potential created by the frozen bosons has slowly decaying correlations .",
    "nonetheless it has fast oscillations on short distances , which are captured by the structure factor , namely the fourier transform of the correlator : @xmath93 this function can be evaluated to give for @xmath94 $ ] and @xmath95 @xmath96 the expression for @xmath97 follows from particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the corresponding functions for an uncorrelated random potential generated by randomly displayed frozen particles are @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "we observe that the fourier spectrum of the frozen - boson potential is extremely broad , and it has a flat maximum for @xmath100 , reflecting the short wavelength oscillations of the potential .",
    "hence we are in presence of a correlated but strongly fluctuating potential . in the following section we will see that such a potential generally leads to anderson localization of all single - particle states and to the suppression of quasi - condensation at all fillings . throughout the rest of the paper",

    "nonetheless this initially coherent expansion is rapidly suppressed due to localization , which leads to a decrease and broadening of the momentum peaks at larger times up to a final steady - state mdf in which two broad peaks survive , and which corresponds to a localized state in real space as seen in subsection [ transport.localization ] .",

    "initially @xmath55 is two - fold degenerate , corresponding to reflection symmetry at the center of the system , and it increases following a universal power law independent of the particle number , similarly to what is observed in absence of disorder but with a different disorder - dependent exponent . as in the case @xmath17 , at a characteristic time @xmath144 the two degenerate natural orbitals start to move into opposite directions , and correspondingly the time evolution of @xmath55 turns into a decreasing behavior ; @xmath144 strongly depends on the disorder strength ( fig .",
    "[ transport.lambdavaru ] ) , while its dependence on the particle number @xmath19 becomes weaker for large @xmath19 , where @xmath144 is seen to approach an asymptotic value ( fig .",
    "[ transport.lambdavarn ] ) . unlike the case @xmath17 , at a later stage the expansion of the system is stopped by disorder , and the degeneracy in the lowest nos is removed , going from two propagating ones to a single no localized in the system center .",
    "hence the expanding system of hardcore bosons from a pure mott state shows a crossover from an incipient quasi - condensation regime at finite momenta to a localization regime .",

    "the original experimental proposal motivating this work is reported in ref .  , where the use of state - dependent lattices was initially envisioned to create the quantum superposition of random potentials .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    ", two hyperfine states of the same atomic species can be loaded in the minima of two different polarization components of an optical lattice at a so called `` magic wavelength '' @xcite , at which each hyperfine state couples to one and only one polarization component .",
    "hence , if the two polarization components are initially shifted by @xmath149 in space , the two species are non essentially interacting ( see fig .  [ two species interaction ] ) .",
    "the possibility of increasing drastically the intensity of one of the two polarization components would allow for a sudden quench of the hopping of one of the two species , preparing in this way the quantum superposition of random potentials .",
    "the two species can be then brought into interaction at different strengths by shifting the spatial phase between the two polarization components of the lattice .",
    "an adiabatic shift would transfer the mobile species to the bose - glass ground state in the random potential , as discussed in section [ ground state properties ] , whereas a sudden shift would give rise to an out - of - equilibrium bose - glass state as steady state after a transient evolution , as discussed in section [ single trap ] . as demonstrated in ref .",
    ", the hardcore regime is achieved by using deep lattices for both polarization components and extremely dilute gases of both hyperfine states , so that a density of less than one atom per site is achieved in the lattice after loading .",
    "as seen in section [ transport properties ] , expansion experiments in the disorder potential require to confine the two components with strongly different trapping frequencies , and then to release one of the two traps independently of the other . making use of the selective coupling of different hyperfine states to different polarization components of a magic - wavelength laser ,",
    "it is possible to more strongly confine one of the two species through an optical dipole trap obtained by a tightly focused and polarized laser propagating transverse to the chain direction in the one - dimensional optical lattice .        throughout all the previous sections we have seen that the onset of localization leaves very strong signatures on the momentum distribution , which is observed in standard time - of - flight experiments .",
    "moreover expansion experiments in the disorder potential lead to exponentially localized steady states , whose density profile can be reconstructed by absorption images taken shortly after turning off all lasers @xcite . despite the averaging over the various tubes of the one - dimensional optical lattice @xcite ,",
    "the extreme tails of the averaged particle density distribution should be dominated by the exponentially localized tails of the particle density in the central tubes of the one - dimensional optical lattice .",
    "in this paper we have shown that a gas of one - dimensional hardcore bosons undergoes genuine quantum localization effects when set into interaction with a secondary species of bosons frozen in a massive quantum superposition of fock states .",
    "each fock state can be regarded as a realization of a random potential , and the unitary evolution of the mobile species of bosons follows all possible paths related to the various disorder realizations _ in parallel_. physically relevant states in which one can prepare the frozen bosons , as for instance the superfluid state in the hardcore limit , realize a rapidly fluctuating disorder potential over the length scale of a few lattice spacings ; despite its power - law decaying correlations , the disorder potential is found to lead to the same localization effects as those observed in a _ fully uncorrelated _ potential . in the hardcore boson limit for the mobile species",
    "these effects can be studied exactly in real time through jordan - wigner diagonalization , and we can numerically simulate realistic experimental setups for the dynamical preparation of localized many - body states . the equilibrium state of the hardcore bosons in the random potential is found to be a homogeneous bose - glass state with exponentially decaying correlations ; a similar state can be realized also dynamically after a sudden on - turn of the interaction between the two species . when the hardcore bosons are initially confined in a tight trap and then set free to expand in the random potential , for any non - vanishing disorder strengths the expansion stops and the system reaches an exponentially localized state .    for any setup discussed in this work ,",
    "we observe the absence of quasi - condensation and quasi - long - range order due to the disorder potential .",
    "when the two species are confined in the same region and brought into interaction , the steady state of the system displays exponentially decaying off - diagonal correlations ; in the expansion experiments the disorder potential destroys the effects of fermionization ( when expanding from an initially dilute state ) and quasi - condensation at finite momentum ( when expanding from a mott state ) .",
    "hence disorder created by a species of frozen hardcore bosons represents a very robust way to experimentally implement strongly fluctuating random potentials in optical lattices , and to realize fundamental localization effects of many - body systems .",
