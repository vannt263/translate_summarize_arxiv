    "computational time - reversal imaging ( ctri ) has become an important research area in recent years , with relevant applications in radar imaging , exploration seismics , nondestructive material testing , medical imaging [ 1 - 9 ] etc .",
    "ctri uses the information carried by scattered acoustic , elastic or electro - magnetic waves to obtain images of the investigated domain [ 1 ] .",
    "it was shown that scattered acoustic waves can be time - reversed and focused onto their original source location through arbitrary media , using a so - called time - reversal mirror [ 2 ] .",
    "this important result shows how one can use ctri to identify the location of multiple point scatterers ( targets ) in a known background medium [ 3 ] . in this case , a back - propagated signal is computed , rather than implemented in the real medium , and its peaks indicate the existence of possible scattering targets .",
    "the current methods for ctri are based on the null subspace projection operator , obtained through the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the frequency response matrix [ 4 - 9 ] .",
    "motivated by several results obtained in random low rank approximation theory , here we investigate the problem of image recovery from a small number of random and noisy measurements , and we show that this problem is equivalent to a randomized approximation of the null subspace of the frequency response matrix .",
    "we consider a system consisting of an array of @xmath0 transceivers ( i.e. each antenna is an emitter and a receiver ) located at @xmath1 @xmath2 , and a collection of @xmath3 distinct scatterers ( targets ) with scattering coefficients @xmath4 , located at @xmath5 @xmath6 ( fig .",
    ", @xmath7 is the dimensionality of the space .",
    "also , we assume that the wave propagation is well approximated in the space - frequency domain @xmath8 by the inhomogeneous helmholtz equation [ 1 - 9 ] : @xmath9 \\psi ( x,\\omega ) = -s(x,\\omega ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the wave amplitude produced by a localized source @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the wavenumber of the homogeneous background , with @xmath13 the frequency , @xmath14 the homogeneous background wave speed , and @xmath15 the wavelength . here , @xmath16 is the index of refraction : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the wave speed at location @xmath19 . in the background we have @xmath20 , while @xmath21 , measures the change in the wave speed at the scatterers location .    the fundamental solutions , or the green functions , for this problem satisfy the following equations : @xmath22 g_{0}(x , x^{\\prime } ) = -\\delta ( x - x^{\\prime } ) , \\ ] ] @xmath9 g(x , x^{\\prime } ) = -\\delta ( x - x^{\\prime } ) , \\ ] ] for the homogeneous and inhomogeneous media , respectively .",
    "the fundamental solution @xmath23 for the inhomogeneous medium can be written in terms of that for the homogeneous one @xmath24 as : @xmath25 this is an implicit integral equation for @xmath23 . since the scatterers are assumed to be pointlike , the regions with @xmath26 are assumed to be finite , and included in compact domains @xmath27 centered at @xmath28 , @xmath29 , which are small compared to the wavelength @xmath15 .",
    "therefore we can write : @xmath30 and consequently we obtain : @xmath31 if the scatterers are sufficiently far apart we can neglect the multiple scattering among the scatterers @xmath32 and we obtain the born approximation of the solution [ 10 ] : @xmath33 if @xmath19 corresponds to the receiver location @xmath34 , and @xmath35 corresponds to the emitter location @xmath36 , then we obtain : @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the elements of the frequency response matrix @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "the response matrix @xmath40 is obviously a complex and symmetric @xmath41 matrix , since the same green function is used in both the transmission and the reception paths .",
    "an important step in ctri is to determine the frequency response matrix @xmath42 .",
    "this can be done by performing a series of @xmath0 experiments , in which a single element of the array is excited with a suitable signal @xmath43 and we measure the frequency response between this element and all the other elements of the array [ 1 - 9 ] . in general , given the green function @xmath24 , the general solution to the helmholtz equation is the convolution : @xmath44 thus , if the @xmath45 antenna emits a signal @xmath46 then , using the convolution theorem in the fourier domain , the field produced at the location @xmath47 is @xmath48 .",
    "if this field is incident on the @xmath49-th scatterer , it produces the scattered field @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the total wave field , due to a pulse emitted by a single element at @xmath36 and scattered by the @xmath3 targets can be expressed as : @xmath51 if this field is measured at the @xmath52-th antenna we obtain : @xmath53    in ctri one forms the symmetric self - adjoint matrix [ 1 - 9 ] : @xmath54 where the star denotes the adjoint and the bar denotes the complex conjugate ( @xmath55 , since @xmath56 is symmetric ) .",
    "@xmath57 is the frequency - domain version of a time - reversed response matrix , thus @xmath58 corresponds to performing a scattering experiment , time - reversing the received signals and using them as input for a second scattering experiment .",
    "therefore , time - reversal imaging relies on the assumption that the green function can be always calculated .",
    "as long as the number of transceivers exceeds the number of scatterers , @xmath59 , the matrix @xmath60 is rank deficient and it has only @xmath3 non - zero eigenvalues , with the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath61 , @xmath62 . when the scatterers are well resolved , the eigenvectors can be back - propagated as @xmath63 , and consequently the radiated wavefields focus at target locations .",
    "thus , each eigenvector can be used to locate a single scatterer . here , @xmath64 is the green function vector , which expresses the response at each array element due to a single pulse emitted from @xmath47 : @xmath65 ^{t}.\\ ] ]    the above result does not apply to the case of poorly - resolved targets . in this case , the eigenvectors of @xmath60 are linear combinations of the target green function vectors @xmath66 .",
    "thus , back - propagating one of these eigenvectors generates a linear combination of wavefields , each focused on a different target location .",
    "the subspace - based algorithms , based on the multiple signal classification ( music ) method , can be used in this more general situation [ 7 - 9 ] .",
    "the signal subspace method assumes that the number @xmath3 of point targets in the medium is lower than the number of transceivers @xmath0 , and the general idea is to localize multiple sources by exploiting the eigenstructure and the rank deficiency of the response matrix @xmath40 .",
    "the svd of the matrix @xmath60 is given by : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the left and right singular vectors . since @xmath40 is rank - deficient ,",
    "all but the first @xmath3 singular values vanish : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the first @xmath3 singular vectors span the essential signal subspace , while the remaining @xmath73 columns span the null - subspace . the projection on the null - subspace is given by : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the identity matrix .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath76 , and therefore @xmath77 , for any @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the target locations must correspond to the peaks in the music pseudo - spectrum for any @xmath13 : @xmath78 where @xmath64 is the free - space green function vector . thus",
    ", one can form an image of the scatterers by plotting , at each point @xmath47 , the quantity @xmath79 .",
    "the resulting plot will have large peaks at the locations of the scatterers .",
    "let us first present several results on random rank approximation .",
    "the svd of a @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) matrix @xmath82 $ ] can be written as [ 11 ] : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the rank of @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the left and right singular vectors , and the singular values ( in decreasing order ) are : @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath89 one can always compute the svd of the transpose matrix and then swap the left and right singular vectors in order to recover the svd of the original matrix .",
    "we also remind that the frobenius and the spectral norms of @xmath85 are [ 11 ] : @xmath90 if we define @xmath91 for any @xmath92 , then , by the eckart - young theorem , @xmath93 is the best rank @xmath94 approximation to @xmath85 with respect to the spectral norm and the frobenius norm [ 11 ] . thus ,",
    "for any matrix @xmath95 of rank at most @xmath94 , we have : @xmath96 from basic linear algebra we have : @xmath97 .\\ ] ] also , we say that a matrix @xmath85 has a good rank @xmath94 approximation if @xmath98 is small with respect to the spectral norm and the frobenius norm .",
    "our problem is to substitute @xmath93 with some other rank @xmath94 matrix @xmath99 , which is much simpler than @xmath93 , and does not require the full knowledge of @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the matrix @xmath99 must satisfy the general condition : @xmath100 where @xmath101 represents a tolerable level of error for the given application .",
    "several important results have been recently obtained regarding this problem .",
    "it has been shown that one can compute a rank @xmath94 approximation of @xmath85 from a randomly chosen submatrix of @xmath85 [ 12 , 13 ] . for any @xmath92 and @xmath102 this method",
    "uses a matrix @xmath99 , containing only a random sample of @xmath94 rows of matrix @xmath85 , so that : @xmath103 holds with probability of at least @xmath104 .",
    "recently , the above result has been improved : @xmath105 by taking into account that the additive error @xmath106 can be arbitrarily large compared to the true error @xmath107 [ 14 ] .",
    "these results show that the sparse matrix @xmath99 recovers almost as much from @xmath85 as the best rank approximation matrix @xmath93 .    in a different approach [ 15 ]",
    ", it has been shown that one can substitute @xmath108 with a sparse matrix @xmath109 $ ] , where @xmath110 with probability @xmath111 , and @xmath112 with probability @xmath113 .",
    "this result asserts that it is possible to find a good low rank approximation to @xmath85 even after randomly omitting many of its entries .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that the stronger the spectral features of @xmath85 the more of its entries we can afford to omit .    another observation is related to the noise effect on low rank approximation .",
    "one can model this by adding to @xmath85 a matrix @xmath114 whose entries are independent gaussian random variables with mean @xmath115 and standard deviation @xmath116 .",
    "as long as @xmath116 is not too big , the optimal rank @xmath117 approximation @xmath118 to @xmath119 will approximate @xmath85 nearly as well as @xmath108 [ 15 ] .",
    "this stability of low rank approximations with respect to gaussian noise is well - understood , and in fact low rank approximations are frequently used with the explicit purpose of removing gaussian noise .",
    "the above results can be transferred to the ctri problem by substituting the matrix @xmath85 with the frequency response matrix @xmath40 , and considering a sparse matrix @xmath120 satisfying the above conditions for the matrix @xmath99 .",
    "also , from the ctri considerations , we can form the matrix : @xmath121 as a substitute for @xmath60 . since @xmath120 is a rank @xmath122 approximation of @xmath40 , the rank of @xmath123",
    "will also be @xmath3 , and its svd will be given by : @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the left and right singular vectors , and all but the first @xmath3 singular values vanish : @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath72 .",
    "now , since @xmath120 is a rank @xmath3 approximation of @xmath129 , the last @xmath73 right singular vectors of @xmath123 will approximate the null - subspace of @xmath123 ( and implicitly of @xmath120 ) .",
    "thus , the approximate projection on the null - subspace is @xmath130 with the corresponding music pseudo - spectrum given by : @xmath131    in order to illustrate and validate numerically the above results , we have considered a two dimensional scenario , including @xmath132 transceivers , separated by @xmath133 and located at @xmath134 ^{t}$ ] , where @xmath135 is the side of the imaging area .",
    "the number of targets ( with the scattering coefficients @xmath136 ) is set to @xmath137 and their position is randomly generated in the imaging area .",
    "the computational image grid is also set to @xmath138 pixels .",
    "the two dimensional green function is @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the zero order hankel function of the first kind .",
    "the noise level is characterized by the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "snr compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise .",
    "the higher the ratio , the less obtrusive the background noise is .",
    "snr measures the power ratio between a signal and the background noise : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is average power and @xmath85 is root mean square ( rms ) amplitude .",
    "let us first consider the case when the matrix @xmath120 is obtained by randomly selecting @xmath143 rows of the matrix @xmath144 . in figure 2",
    "we give the results obtained for the extreme case of @xmath145 and for different levels of noise , @xmath146 .",
    "one can see that even for this extreme case the results are actually pretty good . by increasing @xmath147",
    "the quality of the image improves even at high levels of noise , as shown on figure 3 , where @xmath148 and the noise is fixed at @xmath149 on the first line of images , and respectively @xmath150 on the second line of images . if @xmath151 the algorithm does nt work .    in figure 4",
    "we give the results obtained when the elements of the matrix @xmath152 are selected randomly as : @xmath153 with probability @xmath111 , and @xmath154 with probability @xmath113 ( we also conserved the symmetry @xmath155 during the random selection ) .",
    "the figure matrix is organized on lines and columns .",
    "the lines correspond to the probability @xmath156 , and the columns correspond to the noise level @xmath157 .",
    "we have shown that the problem of image recovery from a small number of random and noisy measurements is equivalent to a randomized approximation of the null subspace of the frequency response matrix .",
    "the obtained results show that one can recover the sparse time - reversal image from fewer ( random ) measurements than conventional methods use . from the analytical results and the numerical experiments",
    "we conclude that the minimum number of measurements is @xmath158 , where @xmath3 is the rank of the full matrix @xmath42 .              c. prada , s. manneville .",
