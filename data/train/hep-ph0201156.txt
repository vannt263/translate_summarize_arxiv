    "the presence of large amounts of non  luminous components in the universe has been identified along the years by different means and on different scales : on the galactic scale , the flatness of the rotational curves of many galaxies indicates a dark component which is presumably distributed as a halo around the galaxies @xcite ; clusters points toward a sizeable contribution of unseen matter distributed around and between galaxies @xcite ; more recently , on cosmological scales , the combination of the results on high  redshift supernovae @xcite and on the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite is pointing toward a flat universe whose energy density is dominated by a dark vacuum component ( cosmological constant , quintessence ) together with a sizeable dark component of matter . in terms of the density parameter @xmath0 , the current view can be summarized as follows @xcite : the total amount of matter / energy of the universe is @xmath1 , and this is composed of a matter component @xmath2 and a vacuum  energy component @xmath3 . even though the actual numbers vary a little depending on the priors of the statistical analyses ,",
    "the clear indication of the latest data is that the universe is strongly dominated by dark ( and unknown ) components .",
    "in fact the numbers above can not be reconciled with a universe made only of standard components : from primordial nucleosynthesis studies , baryons can contribute only at the level of @xmath4 @xcite , while luminous matter is known to provide only a contribution of order @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we are therefore facing the presence of at least _ three dark components _ in the universe : dark baryons , dark non  baryonic matter and dark energy .",
    "the existence of both dark ( relativistic or non  relativistic ) exotic matter and dark energy asks for extension of the standard model of fundamental interactions , since no known particle or field can explain either of these components .    in this review , we will discuss the current status of the non  baryonic dark matter problem . for reviews on dark baryons and dark energy ,",
    "we will discuss the efforts to explain the amount of dark matter in the universe , which we summarize as : @xmath6 and the studies related to the searches for dark matter particles .",
    "dark matter candidates must be looked for in schemes beyond the standard model .",
    "the interesting feature of many of these models is that they are extensions whose primary motivation is not related to dark matter : in spite of this , they contain particles which have the right properties to act as dark matter .",
    "this is especially true for supersymmetric theories , which are the ones with richer phenomenology for dark matter , but interesting candidates may also be found in theories which do not involve supersymmetry .    among the non  supersymmetric candidates , the _ massive neutrino _ and the _ axion _ are the most direct possibilities .",
    "a light massive neutrino represents the simplest extension of the standard model .",
    "the recent results on the atmospheric @xcite and solar @xcite anomalies strongly indicate that neutrinos do possess a mass : a consequence of this is that neutrinos could also compose at least a fraction of dark matter . from the atmospheric neutrino analyses",
    "@xcite , we deduce that neutrinos can provide @xmath7 , but very likely they can not contribute more than @xmath8 in order not to spoil the process of structure formation .",
    "therefore , a massive neutrino can only be ( and very likely is ) present as a sub  dominant dark matter component .",
    "although less economic from the point of view of particle physics , it is also possible to have very massive neutrinos ( @xmath9 gev ) which again would contribute only partially , at the level of @xmath10@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "sterile neutrinos with masses in the kev range and mixing angles of the order of @xmath12 rad may play a role , since they may provide @xmath13 ",
    "@xmath14 @xcite , and therefore explain the dark matter amount of eq.([eq : dm ] ) .",

    "quinn mechanism .",
    "they may be produced in the early universe by means of different mechanisms , either thermally or non  thermally ( misalignment of the axionic field , decay of axionic strings ) @xcite .",
    "the current limits @xcite from axion searches and cosmology constrain this particle to have either a mass around 10 ev or in the mass range @xmath15@xmath11 ev . in both cases , axions can solve the dark matter problem stated in eq.([eq : dm ] ) , but they can also be a sub ",

    ". gravity ",
    "mediated models predict as dark matter particle either the _ neutralino _ or the _ sneutrino _ @xcite .",
    "the neutralino may be the dark matter candidate also in anomaly  mediated models",

    ", we finally recall _ mirror particles _",
    "@xcite or some type of _ scalar fields _ @xcite .    from the above discussion on particle dark matter candidates ,",
    "a fact clearly arises : non  baryonic dark matter may naturally be multi  component .",
    "an example of this occurs , for instance , in models where the cp problem is solved by the axion and the hierarchy problem is explained by low ",
    "energy supersymmetry . in this case , the axion and the axino or the neutralino are all dark matter components , plus the massive neutrino which nowadays appears to be an unavoidable dark matter component . which one would turn out to be the dominant candidate would depend on the characteristics of the specific model which one can build .",
    "but the possibility of multi  component dark matter is interesting , because the detectability of a specific candidate is not in general related to the fact that this particle is the dominant component of dark matter . usually , at least for candidates like the neutralino in standard cosmology , it turns out that it is easier to detect a relic particle which is sub ",
    "dominant @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that detection rates rely on the cross sections of the processes of scattering or annihilation , while on the contrary the relic abundance is inversely proportional to the annihilation cross section .",
    "this roughly induces an anti  correlation between detection rates and cosmological abundance : therefore large detection rates are often related to low relic abundances .",
    "it is not trivial to have a relic particle which is at the same time a dominant dark matter component and potentially detectable .",
    "clearly this last situation is the most appealing one .    as for the most studied candidate which is the neutralino , in the following",
    "it will be shown that this situation can occur in suitable classes of supersymmetric models .",
    "this is one of the properties that makes the neutralino a very appealing candidate .",
    "the existence of a relic particle in supersymmetric theories arises from the conservation of a symmetry , @xmath16parity , which prevents the lightest of all the superpartners from decaying .",
    "the nature and the properties of this particle depend on the way supersymmetry is broken , and we have already seen that the neutralino can be the dark matter candidate in models where supersymmetry is broken through gravity ( or anomaly ) mediated mechanisms .",
    "the actual implementation of a specific supersymmetric scheme depends on a number of assumptions on the structure of the model and on the relations among its parameters .",
    "this induces a large variability of the phenomenology of neutralino dark matter . in this section",
    "we briefly recall the supersymmetric models which have been mostly studied for neutralino dark matter , while in the next sections we will give a few examples of calculations of relic abundance and detection rates in some of these schemes . for details concerning the models and their implementations for neutralino dark matter calculations , we refer to the list of references provided below and references quoted therein .",
    "the simplest and most direct implementation of supersymmetry is represented by the _ minimal supergravity _ ( msugra )",
    "scheme @xcite , where , in addition to requiring gauge coupling constant unification at the gut scale , also all the mass parameters in the supersymmetric breaking sector are universal at the same gut scale . the low  energy sector of the model",
    "is obtained by evolving all the parameters through renormalization group equations ( rge ) : this process also induces the breaking of the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry in a radiative way ( rewsb ) .",
    "this model is very predictive , since it relies only on four free parameters , but at the same time it induces a very constrained phenomenology at low  energy .",
    "it also appears to be quite sensitive to some standard model parameters , like the mass of the top and bottom quarks ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) and the strong coupling constant @xmath19 .",
    "a more relaxed implementation of this supersymmetric scheme is offered by _",
    "non  universal supergravity _ ( nusugra ) @xcite , where some of the unification conditions at the gut scale are relaxed : non  universality has been studied in the higgs , in the sfermion and in the gaugino sectors .",
    "specific patterns of non  universality may be originated through mechanisms which involve effects of extra ",
    "dimensions , like in _ d  brane _ @xcite and _ string models _ @xcite .",
    "these models also may be very predictive , with very few free parameters , but the relations among them is different from what is postulated in msugra models .",
    "it has also been realized that unification conditions , both for gauge couplings and/or mass parameters , may occur at scales which are different from the standard gut scale at about @xmath20 gev .",
    "this unification scale may be lower than the usual gut scale ( _ intermediate unification scale models _ ) @xcite , and this induces a modification of neutralino phenomenology at low energy .",
    "a different approach is offered by the _ low  energy supersymmetric model _ ( effmssm ) @xcite , defined directly at the ew scale , which is where the phenomenology of neutralino dark matter is actually studied .",
    "also in this case we have to make assumptions in order to reduce the number of free parameters to a manageable number .",
    "these assumptions must be mild enough not to represent an arbitrary over  constraint on the model , and all the relevant parameters at the ew scale must be represented .",
    "it is possible in this case to work with six or seven free parameters .",
    "other models which have been discussed in the literature in connection with neutralino dark matter are _ dilaton domination _",
    "models @xcite , models with _",
    "cp  violation _",
    "@xcite and _ anomaly mediated models _ @xcite .    the parameter space of all the models is constrained by a number of relevant experimental bounds which mostly come from accelerator physics .",
    "negative searches of supersymmetry at lep @xcite and tevatron @xcite are currently constraining charginos to be heavier than about 105 gev and sleptons and squarks to be heavier than 90100 gev .",
    "the bounds from lep on the lightest supersymmetric higgs boson @xmath21 indicate that its mass is larger than 90 gev for small coupling of @xmath21 with @xmath22quarks , while for intermediate and large values of this coupling the bound on the mass is about 114 gev @xcite .",
    "tevatron further constrains the mass of @xmath21 in some sectors of the supersymmetric parameter space ( namely , large values of @xmath23 , the ratio of the vev s of the two neutral higgses ) @xcite .",
    "finally , an important constraint for all supersymmetric models comes from the measured values of the branching ratio of the radiative decay @xmath24 , which , in addition to the standard model terms , can get sizeable contributions from supersymmetric loops @xcite .",
    "notice that the requirement that the neutralino is a dark matter particle , implies that also cosmology imposes a limit on supersymmetric models : in fact , the relic abundance of neutralinos , which can be calculated in a given supersymmetric scheme , can not exceed the upper limit of eq.([eq : dm ] ) .",
    "at present , there is no direct indication that supersymmetry has been found in nature .",
    "however , we just want to mention a few recent results which have been considered as possible hints of supersymmetry .",
    "the first is the excess of signal  like events in the higgs searches at lep : an effect of about 2@xmath25 for a higgs mass around 115 gev has been reported @xcite .",
    "this light higgs may be interpreted as indicative of a supersymmetric higgs .",
    "another indication for physics beyond the standard model comes from a global fit to the precision electroweak data : the analysis shows that the standard model is acceptable with a low ( around 4% ) confidence level @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the data improves considerably if low  energy supersymmetry",
    "is included in the analysis @xcite .    in the last year",
    "another anomaly raised a lot of attention : a possible deviation between the calculated and the measured value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .",
    "however , recent theoretical re  evaluations have shown that the evidence of deviation is very weak @xcite , and therefore instead of indicating a possible presence of supersymmetry , the results on the muon anomalous magnetic moment should be regarded as imposing bounds on the supersymmetric parameter space , as is the case for @xmath24 .",
    "and @xmath26 gev @xcite . inside the dark ( green and blue ) bands : @xmath27.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "neutralino relic abundance , like also neutralino detection rates , is sensitive to the specific supersymmetric model which is employed . in fig .",
    "[ relic ] we show an example , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , which refers to a msugra scheme @xcite in the large @xmath23 regime .",
    "the regions of the parameter space shown in the figure as dark ( blue and green ) bands entail a relic neutralino with relic abundance in the range @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , in that sector of the parameter space the neutralino represents the dominant dark matter component since it is able to fulfill the cosmological requirement of eq.([eq : dm ] ) . instead , in the region which is between the thick and the thin ( blue ) bands ,",
    "neutralino relic abundance is smaller than 0.1 , and in a part of this region it falls below the lower limit of eq.([eq : dm ] ) : in this last case , neutralino can not account for all the dark matter in the universe . on the contrary , in the other two large white regions of fig . 1",
    ", @xmath28 : these regions of the msugra parameter space have to be considered as excluded by the requirement that neutralino relic abundance does not get in conflict with the experimental determination of the amount of dark matter in the universe . in the same parameter space of fig . 1 ,",
    "another region has been identified where @xmath29 can fall in the range of eq.([eq : dm ] ) : this can occur at large @xmath30 @xcite , a region which has been also called as `` focus point model '' ( @xmath31 is the common soft scalar mass parameter at the gut scale and @xmath32 is the common gaugino mass at the gut scale ) .    the situation shown if fig.1 can change substantially if one explores other sectors of the msugra parameter space , like for instance small values of @xmath23 , where the region in which neutralino is the dominant component is quite constrained to values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 which do not exceed a few hundreds of gev , except in very narrow corridors where coannihilation between neutralinos and staus occur @xcite .",
    "it has to be noticed that msugra models turn out to be somewhat sensitive to the standard model parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 and to the details of radiative effects ( radiative corrections , radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ) .",
    "it is therefore difficult to derive definite conclusions on which are the intervals of the msugra parameters where neutralino is a dominant dark matter component ( except for small values of @xmath23 ) .",
    "the effects of non ",
    "universality @xcite affect the low  energy sector of the theory through changes in the rge and in the occurrence of rewsb .",
    "this has the effect of modifying neutralino couplings and the mass spectrum of supersymmetric particles , with the consequence of modifying neutralino relic abundance and the cosmologically relevant regions in the nusugra parameter space .",
    "quite relaxed relic abundance regions are also obtained in the low ",
    "energy realization of supersymmetry , the effmssm @xcite .",
    "neutralino relic particles can be searched for by means of different techniques . basically , the detection methods are of two types : _ direct detection _ , which relies on the possibility to directly measure the interaction of neutralinos with a detector in the laboratory , or",
    "_ indirect detection _ , which tries to identify products of neutralino annihilation .",
    "dark matter particles are supposed to be bounded to the galaxy , since they are part of the dark halo which is responsible for the observed flatness of the rotational curves .",
    "therefore the best place to look for relic neutralinos is the halo of our galaxy .",
    "the dynamics and distribution of these particles are described by a matter and a velocity distribution function , about which there are still large uncertainties .",
    "the distribution in space of these bounded dark particles can be smooth and non  singular at the galactic center , but numerical simulations tend to indicate a cuspy behaviour toward the center of the galaxy as well as a clumpy distribution of dark matter in the halo .",
    "detection rates which depend on annihilation processes which occur in the galactic halo are therefore strongly affected by this uncertainty in the matter distribution . on the contrary ,",
    "detection rates which rely on local properties , like direct detection , are not very much sensitive on how dark matter is distributed in the halo . in this case",
    ", the relevant parameter is the total local dark matter density @xmath33 gev @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "neutralinos can account for all or part of this amount , depending whether they are or not the dominant dark matter component .",
    "therefore , the local neutralino matter density is : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the velocity distribution of dark matter particles in the halo is even more uncertain than the matter distribution , since it is difficult to constrain the way these dark particles move in the halo .",
    "the usual assumption is to consider an isotropic maxwell  boltzmann ( mb ) distribution , as seen in the galactic rest frame .",
    "the relevant parameters in this case are only two : the local rotational velocity @xmath37 km s@xmath38 and the escape velocity @xmath39 km s@xmath38 @xcite",
    ". however , the velocity distribution can be quite different from the simple mb form : it can still be isotropic but non  maxwellian , as well as non  isotropic",
    ". moreover , the halo can be affected by some amount of rotation .",
    "the way dark matter particles behave in velocity space affects mostly direct detection , which relies on the energy transfered from the dark matter particles to a detector .",
    "proposals of looking for extra  galactic neutralino dark matter have also been put forward .",
    "one possibility is to look for energetic gamma rays from neutralino annihilation in dense extragalactic systems , like m87 and local dwarfs spheroidal galaxies @xcite : in order to have potentially detectable signals , clumpiness is needed .",
    "another possibility is the direct detection of dark matter particles coming from outside our galaxy @xcite : these particles have a much lower flux than galactic neutralinos , but they posses some typical features , like an essentially unique velocity and very few flight directions , which can help in discriminating the extra  galactic particles from the ones bounded to the galaxy .      , @xmath18 and @xmath19 fixed at their central values .",

    "we also comment that , especially in strict msugra models , radiative effects are quite critical , especially in the higgs sector where light higgses ( @xmath49 90100 gev ) , not in conflict with the experimental bounds from lep , can be obtained for large values of @xmath23 @xcite and this can induce relatively large values for @xmath50 @xcite . also the signal  like lep higgs events may be compatible with interesting neutralino dark matter phenomenology for direct detection @xcite",

    "the question whether current direct detection sensitivities are probing dominant or subdominant relic neutralinos may be answered in terms of the plot shown if fig.[rhoomega ] , which translates directly in terms of astrophysical and cosmological quantities the direct detection results @xcite . by considering the current interval of sensitivities on the quantity",

    "the neutralino is the dominant component of dark matter both in the universe and at the galactic level . for points which fall inside the band delimited by the slant dot  dashed lines",
    ", the neutralino would provide only a fraction of the cold dark matter both at the level of local density and at the level of the average @xmath0 , a situation which would be possible if the neutralino is not the unique cold dark matter particle component . on the other hand , configurations above the upper dot  dashed line and below the upper horizontal solid line would imply a stronger clustering of neutralinos in our halo as compared to their average distribution in the universe .",
    "this situation may be considered unlikely , since in this case neutralinos could fulfill the experimental range for @xmath43 , but they would contribute only a small fraction to the cosmological cold dark matter content .",
    "finally , configurations above the upper horizontal line are incompatible with the upper limit on the local density of dark matter in our galaxy .",
    "[ iearth ]     [ isun ]     [ antimatter ]        indirect detection relies on the possibility to identify signals which are originated by neutralino self  annihilations .",
    "there are two basic situations : _ annihilation inside the earth or the sun _ , or _",
    "annihilation in the galactic halo_.    the first type of signal , due to neutralino annihilation taking place in celestial bodies ( earth or sun ) where the neutralinos have been gravitationally captured and accumulated , is a neutrino flux , which can be detected in a neutrino telescope as a flux of _ up  going muons _ @xcite .",
    "since the process relevant for accumulation of neutralino is capture , which relies on neutralino scattering off the nuclei of the earth and the sun , this detection technique is sensitive only to local properties of the galaxy , like direct detection . in figs .",
    "7 and 8 we show the flux of upgoing muons calculated in the effmssm for the signal coming from the earth and the sun , respectively @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric configurations which are shown are only the ones which are currently at the level of being explored by direct detection and the upper limit on the upgoing muon flux from macro is shown as a solid line .",
    "we can see that indirect detection at neutrino telescopes is partially competitive with direct detection , although a large fraction of configurations which are explored by direct detection require more sensitive neutrino telescopes in order to be probed .",
    "neutralino annihilations can take place also directly in the galactic halo .",
    "in this case the signals can consist in : a _ diffuse neutrino flux _",
    "@xcite ; a _ diffuse gamma  ray flux _ or a _ gamma  ray line _",
    "@xcite ; exotic components in cosmic rays : _ positrons _",
    "@xcite , _ antiprotons _",
    "@xcite and _ antideuterium _ @xcite . for this type of signals , global properties of the halo",
    "are relevant , and therefore in this case the matter distribution of neutralinos is an important quantity . in particular , the overdensities which would be present in a clumpy halo have the effect of largely enhancing the predicted signals @xcite .",
    "neutrino and gamma fluxes require clumpiness to reach detectable levels . also the recent anomaly in the heat data @xcite on positrons may be explained by a signal originated by neutralino annihilation if overdensities are present in the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , antiprotons and antideuterium may be detectable also in a smooth halo .    in fig .",
    "9 we show the correlation between the antiproton and the antideuterium flux calculated in the effmssm for a smooth halo @xcite . the vertical band represents the bess 95 + 97 measurement of the antiproton flux .",
    "all the points on the right of this band have to be considered as excluded , since they provide a flux in excess of the measurements : this fact shows that the antiproton signal can be used to constrain the supersymmetric parameter space . at present",

    "@xcite shows that the antideuterium signature is quite promising and the next generation detectors may be able to probe a sizeable fraction of supersymmetric configurations .",
    "this is shown in fig . 9 by the horizontal line , which denotes the reaching capability of the ams detector on a 3year flight on board of the space station .",
    "recently , a detector designed specifically to look for antideuterium in cosmic rays has been proposed @xcite .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ gamma ] shows the predicted gamma ",
    "ray line flux in the effmssm for a nfw halo , compared with an estimation of the glast sensitivity .",
    "we have seen that we can identify two main issues in particle dark matter studies : _ i ) _ to explain the observed amount of dark matter in the universe ( @xmath54 ) by finding suitable particle candidates ; _ ii ) _ to detect a relic particle . for both of them",
    "there appear to be good prospects of success .    as for the candidates ,",
    "there are many proposed particles which could act as dark matter .",
    "some of these candidates turn out to be quite natural , like _",
    "e.g. _ the massive neutrino , the axion or the neutralino .",
    "almost all of the proposed candidates can play the role of the dominant dark matter component , although for some of them a non ",
    "standard cosmology is required .",
    "an important remark is that , from the particle physics point of view , dark matter may naturally be multi  component .",
    "a multi  component dark matter scenario offers opportunity for interesting phenomenology not only to the dominant candidate , which would explain the cosmological observation on the @xmath55 parameter , but also to the sub ",
    "dominant candidates , since usually these are the ones which are easier to detect .",
    "the detection of a particle which is a relic from the early universe would be a very important and exciting result .    as for detection , perspectives are good , both for direct and for indirect detection techniques , especially for the most interesting and studied candidate , the neutralino .",
    "the possibility to have detectable rates for neutralinos depends on the specific supersymmetric model which is considered , and quite generally it appears simpler to detect a relic neutralino which is a sub  dominant dark matter component .",
    "nevertheless , there are many supersymmetric schemes where relic neutralinos can provide enough cosmological abundance to explain the observed amount of dark matter , and at the same time they can have detection rates large enough to be accessible to direct , and also to some indirect , detection methods .",
    "the positive indication of annual modulation in the detection rate of the dama / nai collaboration can be interpreted as pointing towards a direct detection of a relic massive particle .",
    "this effect is , at the moment , the most compelling indication for a particle dark matter signal . when interpreted as originated from relic neutralinos , the annual modulation effect can be explained in a number of realization of supersymmetry .",
    "it is worth noticing that the presence of a signal from dark matter , like the annual modulation effect or signals which could hopefully come in future experiments , can be very important not only for astrophysics and cosmology but also for particle physics , since the need to explain the effect can help in deriving properties of particle physics models and possibly discriminate among different realizations , for instance of supersymmetry .",
    "this work was partially supported by the research grants of the italian ministero delluniversit e della ricerca scientifica e tecnologica ( murst ) within the _ astroparticle physics project_. i also wish to thank the organizers for inviting me to deliver this talk at the taup 2001 conference .",
