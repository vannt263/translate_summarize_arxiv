    "the tensor model is an interesting generalization of the matrix model .",
    "while the matrix model gives an analytical method to describe the two - dimensional simplicial quantum gravity @xcite , the tensor model was proposed to describe the simplicial quantum gravity in higher dimensions and dynamical lattice topological field theories @xcite .",
    "feynman diagrams of the models are assumed to correspond to dual diagrams of simplicial complexes . in the matrix model , the topological expansion of the two - dimensional manifolds",
    "can be realized in the large @xmath1 expansion , and this fact is essentially used in the computation .",
    "unfortunately , this kind of expansion has not been realized in the tensor model so far , and it seems hard to use the tensor model as an analytical tool to study quantum gravity .",
    "another interpretation of rank - three tensor model was proposed by the present author in @xcite .",
    "a fuzzy space can be characterized by a rank - three tensor @xmath2 , which defines the algebraic relation @xmath3 between functions @xmath4 on a fuzzy space .",
    "therefore dynamical fuzzy spaces may be described by theory which contains the rank - three tensor as a dynamical variable .",
    "a fuzzy space will be obtained as a classical solution to the equation of motion of a tensor model . unlike the original interpretation in the preceding paragraph",
    ", it will be easier to deduce physical results from the tensor model under this new interpretation .",
    "an important advantage of the tensor model as theory of spacetime is the existence of the symmetry under a fuzzy analog of the general coordinate transformation in general relativity .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the general linear transformation on the rank - three tensor can be naturally identified with it . around the classical solutions ,",
    "the symmetry will be broken and will be non - linearly realized , which is actually the same situation for the general coordinate transformation on a geometric background .",
    "there is an old idea that gravity may be obtained as the nambu - goldstone fields of the spontaneous breaking of the local translational symmetry @xcite .",
    "therefore the tensor model may provide a concrete finite model for the old idea .",
    "the notion of noncommutative coordinates @xcite-@xcite is a natural application of the quantum procedure to spacetime .",
    "in fact , noncommutative field theories are derived as effective field theories on d - branes in string theory with a background @xmath5 field @xcite and of three - dimensional quantum gravity coupled with matter @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", nonassociativity is also known to appear in open string theory with a non - constant background @xmath5 field @xcite .",
    "it was also argued that the algebra of closed string field theory should be commutative nonassociative @xcite .",
    "therefore , though its relation to quantization of spacetime is not clear , it would be fair to say that nonassociativity is also another physically sensible structure of spacetime .",
    "moreover , it is generally much easier to obtain commutative nonassociative fuzzy spaces of physical interest @xcite than noncommutative ones which seem to generally require a kind of symplectic structure .",
    "in addition , quantum field theory on commutative nonassociative spacetimes seems to be able to respect the principles in physics more faithfully @xcite than noncommutative quantum field theory , which is known to have some unusual properties such as the uv / ir mixing @xcite and the violation of causality @xcite and unitarity @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show the existence of some elementary commutative nonassociative fuzzy spaces as classical solutions of the rank - three tensor model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", the rank - three tensor model is defined .",
    "a constraint is imposed on its dynamical variable to simplify the original model in @xcite .",
    "this constraint corresponds to dealing with commutative nonassociative fuzzy spaces . in section [ simpleexample ] , a simple example of a commutative nonassociative space",
    "this space is not a solution to the tensor model , but provides a good reference to understand the qualitative features of the numerical solutions . in section [ numericalsolutions ] ,",
    "the numerical solutions representing fuzzy flat torus and fuzzy spheres of various dimensions are obtained and checked .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "the original model proposed in @xcite contains a symmetric tensor @xmath6 and a rank - three tensor @xmath7 as real dynamical variables . without any constraints on the variable @xmath7",
    ", there are a lot of possibilities of constructing actions , and the analysis to find solutions to equation of motion becomes quite complicated . to simplify the model ,",
    "a constraint will be imposed on the variable @xmath7 . to allow fuzzy spaces to become good approximations to ordinary spaces ,",
    "i assume such a constraint be also satisfied by ordinary spaces .",
    "the algebra of functions on an ordinary continuum space is commutative and associative .",
    "let @xmath8 denote a complete set of independent functions on such a space .",
    "a rank - three tensor defines the product between two functions , f_a * f_b = c_ab^c f_c .",
    "the commutativity implies [ commutativity ] c_ab^c = c_ba^c , while the associativity implies [ associativity ] c_ab^d c_dc^e = c_ad^e c_bc^d .",
    "let me define a tensor _",
    "ab ^dc_bd^c , which is obviously symmetric for the indices .",
    "then let me consider c_abc^d _ dc . by using the associativity",
    ", the right - hand side can be rewritten , and c_abc = c_ad^f c_be^d c_cf^e .",
    "this shows that the tensor @xmath7 is symmetric under the cyclic permutations of the indices .",
    "therefore , from the commutativity , @xmath7 is totally symmetric under the permutations of the indices .",
    "if @xmath9 is assumed to be not singular , @xmath6 can be identified with @xmath10 .",
    "thus the constraint to be imposed on @xmath7 is the total symmetry for the indices , [ constraintc ] c_abc = c_bca = c_cab = c_bac = c_acb = c_cba .",
    "conversely , if one starts with @xmath7 with the constraint , the constraint is not enough to show the associativity , and the algebra generated by @xmath11 will be a commutative nonassociative ( or associative ) algebra in general .    under the constraint ,",
    "the variety of action is drastically simplified , compared with the original proposal @xcite . in the quadratic order of @xmath7 ,",
    "there is only one possibility , s_0=c_abcc^abc . in the quartic order ,",
    "there are only two possibilities , s_1&=&c_abcc^dbcc_defc^aef , + s_2&=&c_abcc^ad_e c^b_dfc^cef .",
    "the total action is given with three coupling constants @xmath12 by [ totals ] s=- s_0+s_1 -4 s_2 , which is graphically shown in fig.[fig : s012 ] .     and a line @xmath6 . ]",
    "this action is invariant under the @xmath13 transformation , [ ctrans ] c_abc&=&m_a^a m_b^bm_c^cc_abc , g^ab&= & m^-1_a^am^-1_b^b g^ab , where @xmath14 is the total number of functions on a fuzzy space and @xmath15 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the transformation can be identified with a fuzzy analog of the general coordinate transformation .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath7 from @xmath16 in is given by [ eom ] -g_0 c_abc+3-g_2 c_ad^ec_be^fc_cf^d=0 , which is graphically represented in fig.[fig : eom ] .        as shown in @xcite , the equation of motion for @xmath6 is automatically satisfied due to the @xmath13 symmetry of the action , provided @xmath6 is not singular and the equation of motion for @xmath7 is satisfied .",
    "an interesting case occurs when @xmath17 . in this case , if the rank - three tensor satisfies the associativity condition , the second and third terms in the equation of motion cancel with each other .",
    "this can be checked by using the graphical representation of the associativity condition in fig.[fig : associativity ] to reconnect the diagrams in fig.[fig : eom ] .",
    "therefore , the presence of the first term in guarantees that the algebraic relation obtained from a classical solution is commutative _ nonassociative_. this is important , because a commutative associative space with a positive ( negative ) definite @xmath6 is trivial in the sense discussed in the following paragraph .",
    "therefore the case @xmath17 selects automatically non - trivial commutative nonassociative fuzzy spaces as classical solutions .",
    "let me show the triviality of a commutative associative fuzzy space which has a positive ( negative ) definite @xmath6 and a finite number of functions , but is not trivial , because there are an infinite number of functions . ] . by using the @xmath13 transformation , a positive ( negative ) definite @xmath6",
    "can be diagonalized to @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) . then , because of the commutativity @xmath20 , the associativity implies n_a n_b = n_b n_a , where @xmath21 is a symmetric matrix defined by @xmath22 .",
    "this mutual commutativity of @xmath21 implies that these matrices can be simultaneously diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix @xmath23 , which keeps @xmath24 invariant , ^b m_c^c ( n_a)_bc=e(a , b ) _ bc , where @xmath25 denotes the diagonal elements .",
    "because of the commutativity @xmath20 , this @xmath26 will transform @xmath7 to a totally diagonal form , c_abc= m_a^am_b^b m_c^c c_abc=e(a ) _ ab _ bc .",
    "this shows that a commutative associative fuzzy space which has a positive ( negative ) definite @xmath6 and a finite number of functions is just a collection of independent points .",
    "conversely , if @xmath7 and @xmath6 have such diagonal forms , the algebra is obviously commutative associative .",
    "let me finally comment on the satiability of the solutions .",
    "the equation of motion just implies that the solutions are the stationary points of the action , but not that they are the local minima .",
    "the analysis of the fluctuations around the classical solutions is required to study the stability , and one can not expect that all the solutions are locally stable . in the euclidean case ( when @xmath6 of a classical solution is positive definite ) , however , there exists an obvious way to define an action in which the solutions to are always stable .",
    "this is given by [ sstable ] s_stable = g_aag_bbg_cc",
    ". this action will generate various euclidean classical solutions to on equal footing , i.e. as its local minima , @xmath27 .    on the other hand",
    ", it does not seem obvious whether a solution must be a stable one to become interesting .",
    "one of the motivation behind in the present research is to discuss gravity in terms of fuzzy space .",
    "it is well known that the conformal mode in the einstein - hilbert action has a reversed kinetic term and therefore the solutions can not be stable in the usual sense .",
    "moreover , when a minkowski case is considered , the stationary points will be interesting in general .",
    "therefore the preference of the choice of an action will depend on the problems in mind . in this paper",
    ", the interest is only in the classical solutions to the equation of motion , and the exact form of the action is not cared .",
    "in this section i will give an analytically treatable example of a commutative nonassociative fuzzy space .",
    "although this space is not a solution to and the number of functions on it is infinite , it has the properties very similar to the numerical solutions in the following section .",
    "therefore this example will provide a good reference to understand the qualitative features of the numerical solutions .",
    "the usual space is characterized by the following algebra of product , e^ip^x_e^iq^x_=e^i(p^+q^ ) x _ , where @xmath28 is a plane wave with momentum @xmath29 on a space coordinated by @xmath30 .",
    "i consider only euclidean spaces . in @xcite ,",
    "the following commutative nonassociative deformation is considered , [ deformprod ] e^ip^x_*e^iq^x_=e^-(p^2+q^2+(p+q)^2 ) e^i(p^+q^ ) x _ , where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is a positive deformation parameter . to describe the deformed space , the index of @xmath7 and @xmath6 of the tensor model is given by the continuous momentum @xmath29 , and their values are taken as [ examplecg ]",
    "c_p_1 p_2 p_3&=&^d(p_1+p_2+p_3 ) e^-(p_1 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2+p_3 ^ 2 ) , + g^p_1p_2&=&^d(p_1+p_2 ) , where @xmath33 is the dimensions of the space , and the vector indices of momenta are suppressed for notational simplicity .",
    "the measure of the momentum integration is defined by @xmath34 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the reality of the functions @xmath4 is assumed , which is the basis of the reality of @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "however the expression is not in such a real coordinate , because @xmath35 is a complex function .",
    "an appropriate real coordinate can be obtained by considering instead the real functions , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "then the indefinite @xmath6 in is transformed to a positive definite one .",
    "for the computation in this section , however , the above complex coordinate is much more convenient , and can be used without confusion . on the other hand , the relation to such a real coordinate must be taken into account in the analysis of fluctuations around classical solutions , as done in @xcite .",
    "there is a simple useful tensor characterizing a fuzzy space , [ defofk ] k^a_bc^acdc_bcd . in the present case ,",
    "putting to , one obtains [ ksimple ] k^p_1_p_2= ( ) ^e^-3p_1 ^ 2 ^d(p_1-p_2 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the factor depending on the momentum in has the form of the heat kernel of the laplacian .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the heat kernel expansion is a powerful method to obtain the low - momentum effective geometry of a fuzzy space .",
    "this method requires an operator on a fuzzy space which corresponds to the heat kernel of the laplacian ( or other elliptic differential operators ) .",
    "an indispensable feature of the laplacian is the invariance under the general coordinate transformation . as for a fuzzy space ,",
    "the properties of @xmath38 is invariant under the @xmath13 transformation , which is a fuzzy analog of the general coordinate transformation in general relativity .",
    "therefore , the operator @xmath38 will be the primary candidate to be used in applying this heat kernel method to derive the low - momentum effective geometry of a fuzzy space in general .",
    "more concretely , the general procedure to obtain the effective geometric quantities of a fuzzy space can be described as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath38 is diagonalizable with positive eigenvalues , which is the case studied in this paper .",
    "the definition shows that @xmath39 is symmetric and ( semi-)positive definite .",
    "therefore , after diagonalizing @xmath6 to @xmath18 by @xmath13 transformation , @xmath39 can be transformed to a diagonal form with positive ( or vanishing ) diagonal elements by the remaining @xmath40 symmetry which keeps @xmath18 .",
    "the part with vanishing eigenvalues should be simply discarded in defining @xmath41 . ] .",
    "then let me define an operator @xmath42 depending on a parameter @xmath43 by k(t)^a_b= _",
    "i ( e_i)^a ( e_i)_b , [ defofkt ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of @xmath38 , respectively , @xmath46 is the maximum of the eigenvalues , and @xmath47 are the dual vectors of @xmath45 , ( e_i)_a ( e_j)^a=_ij . the operator @xmath41 will be assumed to give a fuzzy analogue of a heat kernel of an invariant operator in low - momentum .",
    "then the effective geometric quantities of a fuzzy space such as local curvatures will be obtained by investigating the approximate asymptotic expansion of @xmath48 for appropriate insertion operators @xmath49 , as was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the philosophy behind in the above procedure is that an effective geometry should be defined by a probe .",
    "the probe here is a scalar field .",
    "since @xmath8 span all the functions on a fuzzy space , a real scalar field will be described by a real rank - one tensor @xmath50 .",
    "therefore a candidate of an action of a non - self - interacting scalar field is given by s_scalar=^a ( -k_ab+m_0 ^ 2 g_ab ) ^b , [ sscalar ] where @xmath51 is a constant .",
    "this action respects the invariance under the @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "the dynamics of the scalar field from the action will determine an effective geometry of a fuzzy space .",
    "though the form of a scalar field action is constrained by the @xmath13 symmetry , there still remains large ambiguity , and this may harm the existence of a unique effective geometry .",
    "in fact , the @xmath39 in should be replaced with its logarithm for a direct link to .",
    "moreover @xmath39 in may be replaced with another rank - two symmetric tensor obtained from @xmath7 and @xmath6 . to justify the existence of a unique effective geometry ,",
    "the low - momentum limit of the various scalar field actions must have a universal character .",
    "this is certainly true for the present example .",
    "because of , approaches the standard scalar field action in the low - momentum limit @xmath52 . because of the gaussian nature of , it is obvious that another choice of the rank - two tensor composed of @xmath7 and @xmath6 in will also lead to a similar gaussian form like .",
    "in addition , it is numerically shown in the following section that the behavior of @xmath38 has a good fit with @xmath53 .",
    "although these evidences give only inconclusive support to the procedure and the existence of a unique low - momentum effective geometry , it can safely be insisted that at least some geometric properties can be incorporated in the commutative nonassociative algebra .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the noncommutative geometry .",
    "the matrix algebra itself does not contain any information on geometry .",
    "various geometries results solely from the choice of laplacian or matter field actions @xcite .",
    "now let me discuss another quantity which is not covariant or generally applicable , but is certainly useful to check the numerical results in the following section . to avoid confusion ,",
    "let me denote the functions on the fuzzy space by @xmath54 .",
    "now let me define d(x)d^dp e^-ipx f_p , where @xmath55 is the usual @xmath56-number function and should not be confused with @xmath57 .",
    "this @xmath58 is a fuzzy analog of the delta function with distribution on @xmath59 .",
    "the product of @xmath58 and @xmath60 can be written in the form , d(x)*d(y)&= & d^dp_1 d^dp_2 e^-ip_1x - ip_2yf_p_1*f_p_2 + & = & d^dp_1 d^dp_2 d^dq e^-ip_1x - ip_2yc_p_1p_2^q f_q + & = & d^dz l(x - z , y - z ) d(z ) , where [ fnl ] l(x , y)=d^d p_1 d^d p_2 d^dq e^-ip_1 x - ip_2 y c_p_1p_2^q",
    ". a straightforward computation for the present case shows [ lsimple ] l(x , y)= e^- ( ( x - y)^2+x^2+y^2 ) . as shown in fig.[fig : shapel ] , for general @xmath61 , this two - parameter function has a peak at the origin @xmath62 and is distributed around it .",
    "the distribution is a little bit stretched in the direction @xmath63 .",
    "the profile becomes sharper for smaller @xmath32 , and in the associative limit @xmath64 , @xmath65 approaches @xmath66 as expected from the product of two delta functions on an ordinary space .     in for @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "is plotted . ]    as above , the existence of distribution of @xmath65 around the origin can be regarded as a sign of the fuzziness of a space .",
    "the profile will provide a quantitative measure of the fuzziness .",
    "as the distribution becomes sharper , the fuzziness becomes smaller , and a fuzzy space approaches more an ordinary continuum space . in the following section ,",
    "@xmath65 will be computed for the numerical solutions to check how well the numerical solutions approximate ordinary continuum spaces .",
    "let me finally discuss the general coordinate transformation .",
    "a general coordinate transformation is a transformation of the coordinate @xmath59 to a general invertible function of @xmath59 , [ xpgx ] x=g(x ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , since the right - hand side of can be generally expanded as a linear combination of the functions @xmath4 , the analog of the general coordinate transformation on a fuzzy space is given by the general linear transformation of @xmath4 . on an ordinary space , the transformation of @xmath35 can be written in such a linear form as e^ipx= e^ipg(x)=d^dq c(p , q)e^iqx , where [ cpq ] c(p , q)=1(2)^dd^dx e^-iqx+ipg(x ) . therefore , the corresponding linear transformation for the present example is given by [ fptrans ] f_p=d^dqc(p , q)f_q . then the product of the transformed functions is given by f_p*f_q&=&d^dpd^dq c(p , p)c(q , q)f_p*f_q + & = & d^dr n(p , q;r ) f_r , where [ npqr ] n(p , q;r)&=&d^dpd^dq c(p ,",
    "p)c(q , q)c_pq^r & = & d^dy c(p , y)c(q , r - y)e^-(y^2+(r - y)^2+r^2 ) .    from and , in the case of the ordinary flat space , @xmath69 , one can easily show that [ npqreqcpqr ] n(p , q;r)=c(p+q , r ) , and therefore , f_p*f_q = f_p+q , which implies that the product is invariant under the general coordinate transformation for @xmath69 . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath70 will depend not only on @xmath71 but generally both on @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath61 , and the product can not be invariant under the general coordinate transformation except the obvious rotational and translational symmetry of .",
    "an essential distinction of the @xmath61 case is the existence of the dimensionful parameter @xmath32 .",
    "this dimensionful parameter characterizes the length scale of the fuzziness of the space . in another word ,",
    "a kind of geometric structure is incorporated in the rank - three tensor @xmath7 for @xmath61 , while this is not for the ordinary space @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , as the metric tensor in general relativity is covariantly transformed , the rank - three tensor @xmath7 should be transformed under the general coordinate transformation , which is nothing but the transformation .",
    "this transformation cancels that of the functions , and the product between the functions becomes invariant under the general coordinate transformation .    at the classical solutions ,",
    "the fuzzy analog of the general coordinate transformation symmetry will be broken except some global remaining symmetries of a fuzzy space .",
    "in this section i will numerically obtain some solutions to the equation of motion . by imposing the expected global symmetries ,",
    "i obtain solutions corresponding to fuzzy flat torus and fuzzy spheres of various dimensions . to obtain the non - trivial solutions in the meaning discussed in section [ themodel",

    "it seems inevitable that , since there exists no metric at the beginning , a pregeometric system like the tensor model contains modes which are non - local in the sense of the background of classical solutions .",
    "therefore the right question would be whether such non - local fluctuations lead to serious contradictions to the principles in physics .",
    "there are a number of ways to avoid contradictions like that non - local modes are very heavy or that interactions between local and non - local modes are negligibly small .",

    "similar nonassociativity seems to hold for a fuzzy space in the lower figure . ]    as discussed in section [ simpleexample ] , an interesting aspect of a nonassociative space is that a kind of metric structure is incorporated in the definition",
    ". this would be the most peculiar property distinct from a noncommutative space which seems to be associated with a kind of symplectic structure .",
    "the present construction of the tensor model is not unique .",
    "although the action is among the simplest , there is no reason to discard the higher order interactions .",
    "another ambiguity is the choice of the action of a scalar field on a fuzzy space .",
    "as discussed in section [ simpleexample ] , this ambiguity may harm the existence of a unique low - momentum effective geometry defined by the probe of a scalar field .",

    "<S> rank - three tensor model may be regarded as theory of dynamical fuzzy spaces , because a fuzzy space is defined by a three - index coefficient of the product between functions on it , @xmath0 . in this paper , this previous proposal is applied to dynamical generation of commutative nonassociative fuzzy spaces . it is numerically shown that fuzzy flat torus and fuzzy spheres of various dimensions are classical solutions of the rank - three tensor model . since these solutions are obtained for the same coupling constants of the tensor model , the cosmological constant and the dimensions are not fundamental but can be regarded as dynamical quantities . </S>",
