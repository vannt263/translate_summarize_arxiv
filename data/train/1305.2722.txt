    "the study of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) above 10kev is essential if one wants to study non - thermal processes and observe those sources which are strongly affected by absorption in the soft x - ray band .",
    "another advantage is the possibility of having information on spectral features such as the high energy cut - off and the reflection fraction , which can not be explored with observations performed below 10kev .",
    "the determination of these parameters is important for many reasons : they provide an insight into the physical properties of the region around the central power source , they play a key role in synthesis models of the cosmic x - ray background and are important ingredients for unification theories and torus studies ( e.g @xcite ) . although high energy measurements of agn have been made in the past , mainly with the _ bepposax _ satellite ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , these did not generally pertain to a large and complete sample of sources and were limited to a few bright nearby objects .",
    "this trend is now changing since the launch of facilities like _ integral _ @xcite and _ swift _",
    "@xcite , both having imaging and spectroscopy capabilities on a large field of view . indeed , both _",
    "@xcite on board _ integral _ and _ bat _ @xcite on board _ swift _ have been surveying the high energy sky for many years now , providing many detections of both new and previously known active galaxies , which can now be studied in a systematic way for the first time above 10kev .",
    "cross - calibration between _ bat _ and _ ibis _ is important if one wants to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio or to study source variability over long timescales .",
    "once calibrated , data from both instruments can be used alone or in conjunction with low energy observations to obtain broadband information and to put stronger constraints on spectral parameters .    in this paper , we present the hard x - ray spectral analysis , conducted in the 17150kev energy range , of a complete sample of 87 agn detected by _ integral / ibis _ @xcite . for 80 of these sources",
    "we also used _",
    "bat _ data , with the aim of cross - calibrating the two instruments , studying source variability and constraining the primary continuum .",
    "this work can also be useful for future exploitation of the _ ibis / bat _ agn archive in conjunction with low energy instrument data , for example as an aid to _",
    "nustar _ observations .",
    "the _ integral _ complete sample of agn has been extracted from a set of sources listed in the third _ ibis _ survey @xcite and having a firm identification with an agn .",
    "this complete sample consists of 87 active galaxies of various optical classifications : 41 type 1 agn ( seyfert 1 , 1.2 and 1.5 ) , 33 type 2 agn ( seyfert 1.9 and 2 ) , 5 narrow line seyfert 1s ( nlsy1s ) and 8 blazars ( qsos and bl lacs ) .",
    "full details on the extraction of the complete sample are given in @xcite .",
    "table  [ sample1 ] lists relevant information ( source name , galactic column density , redshift and agn class ) for all objects in the sample .",
    "the _ integral / ibis _ data reported here consist of several pointings performed in the period comprised between launch ( october 2002 ) and the end of april 2008 , for a total of almost 40000 science windows . _",
    "ibis / isgri _ images for each available pointing were generated in various energy bands using the isdc offline scientific analysis software osa @xcite version 7.0 .",
    "count rates at the position of the source were extracted from individual images using data from the _ isgri _ detector @xcite in order to provide light curves in various energy bands ; from these light curves , average fluxes were then extracted and combined to produce an average , 14 channels ( covering the 17kev to 300kev energy range ) , source spectrum ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) .",
    "this spectral extraction has been adopted to deal with the large number of objects listed in the survey .",
    "this method has also been fully tested over the 20100kev band in a number of studies of agn spectral properties ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "_ swift / bat _ spectra were retrieved on the web ; these spectra are from the first 58 months of operations of the _ swift / bat _ telescope @xcite and provide information over the 14195kev band ( note that the spectra have an 8 channel binning ) . in order to overlap with _ ibis _ data and cross - calibrate the two instruments , we explore here a slightly narrower energy band ( 17150kev ) .",
    "_ bat _ and _ ibis _ spectra have been fitted with ` xspec ` version 12.7.1 , using the @xmath3 statistics , assuming that the data are gaussian ; in the following analysis , each parameter error is quoted at 90% confidence level ( @xmath4=2.71 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,>,<,^,^ , > \" , ]      although a simple power - law model describes sufficiently well the data points for the majority of our sources , in some cases it does not fit the data properly . in fact , as can be seen from the fits reported in tables  [ sim_fit_type1 ] and [ sim_fit_type2 ] , 28 sources or @xmath530% of the sample ( 14 type 1 and 14 type 2 objects ) have reduced @xmath3@xmath61.5 , suggesting that a more complex model might be needed to describe their spectra .",
    "we have adopted a @xmath3 threshold value of 1.5 to discriminate between well and bad fitted objects , as there is only a probability of 10% of exceeding this value by chance ,",
    "i.e. no more than 8 sources in the entire sample are expected to have a bad fit .    in the case of these 28 agn ,",
    "we have re - fitted the combined _ bat / ibis _ data using the ` pexrav ` model in ` xspec ` ; this model takes into account features such as the high energy cut - off ( e@xmath2 ) and/or the reflection fraction ( r ) , which can both be present in the energy range probed by the present study .",
    "the reflection component depends on the inclination angle _",
    "i _ between the axis perpendicular to the accretion disk and the line of sight : the smaller the inclination angle , the larger the resulting reflection component . since the quality of the data does not allow to constrain both reflection and inclination at the same time , we have fixed cos(_i _ ) = 0.45 for both type 1 and 2 agn .    in the first instance , we left all relevant parameters free to vary and report in the first row of tables  [ pex_fit1]/[pex_fit1_cont ] and [ pex_fit2]/[pex_fit2_cont ] the results of these fits ; for each source , the tables list photon index , high energy cut - off , reflection fraction , cross - calibration constant , @xmath3 and degrees of freedom , as well as the probability of a fit improvement with respect to the simple power - law model reported in tables  [ sim_fit_type1 ] and [ sim_fit_type2 ] .",
    "although the fit improvement is significant in most cases , it is evident that it is quite difficult to put firm constraints on all free parameters , i.e. power - law photon index , high energy cut - off and reflection , at the same time .",
    "this is mainly due to the lack of data below 17kev and the fact that unfortunately the parameters of interest are closely linked in the fitting procedure .",
    "out of 28 agn analysed , only in two cases ( ngc 4151 and ic 4329a ) it is possible to put constraints on all 3 parameters at the same time . in most other cases , only two out of three parameters analysed could be constrained , specifically the photon index with either the reflection ( in the minority of the sources ) or the high energy cut - off ( in the majority of the objects ) .",
    "there are nevertheless some agn in which neither r or e@xmath2 could be constrained at all .",
    "this suggests that if one wants to get some spectral information from hard x - ray spectra alone , some assumptions must be made on at least one of the 3 parameters involved in the spectral analysis .",
    "for example , among type 1 sources , igr j21247 + 5058 is a well studied source which is known to have little reflection @xcite ; in this case , if we fix the reflection fraction to zero and leave both the photon index and the cut - off energy as free parameters , both quantities are indeed well constrained ( see table  [ pex_fit1 ] , [ pex_fit1_cont ] ) and are compatible with previous studies . on the other hand , the circinus galaxy ( a compton thick agn ) has a well - known cut - off energy located at around 50kev , measured by several instruments such as _ bepposax _ and _ xte _ ( e.g. @xcite ) : fixing e@xmath2 at this value , we are able to constrain both @xmath1 to be 1.80@xmath7 and r to be 0.59@xmath8 . unfortunately not all our sources are well studied at high energies as these two objects and so a more general approach has been adopted in order to deal with all 28 agn .",
    "we therefore choose to fix the reflection component to be 0 , 1 , or 2 ; the higher value of r allows for the extra reflection often observed in agn and likely due to a more complex or peculiar geometry , such as one in which a molecular torus is present alongside an accretion disk , more radiation is emitted toward the reflector than toward the observer or light bending effects are at work @xcite .",
    "the results obtained with fixed values of reflection are reported in tables  [ pex_fit1]/[pex_fit1_cont ] and [ pex_fit2]/[pex_fit2_cont ] , where again a significant fit improvement ( close to 99% or more in at least one of the three cases of r analysed ) is evident in many objects , when comparing these fits with single power - law ones ; the improvement occurs in 75% of the sources , therefore leaving only a handful of agn where the improvement is not as significant .",
    "in a couple of agn , we could not obtain any constraints on the cut - off energy , presumably because it is located at higher energies than those probed by _",
    "ibis / bat_. finally , in a small number of objects , i.e. 10 out of 28 , the reduced @xmath3 obtained using the ` pexrav ` model is still above the threshold of 1.5 adopted in the present study , meaning that in these sources we have not yet achieved a good fit .",
    "these 10 agn ( 4 type 1 and 5 type 2 ) are highlighted in tables  [ pex_fit1 ] , [ pex_fit1_cont ] and [ pex_fit2 ] , [ pex_fit2_cont ] and are discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "the fact that a number of sources are still badly fitted after substituting the simple power - law with the ` pexrav ` model could have various explanations , among which a certain degree of flux variability ( see tables  [ sim_fit_type1]/[sim_fit_type2 ] ) and/or poor quality data ( either related to _ ibis _ , _ bat _ or both ) .",
    "in addition , there may be further spectral complexity like in cygnus a , where the hot temperature of the surrounding cluster could have an effect on the source spectrum , even above 10kev @xcite .",
    "however , a common problem that we find in these 9 cases is a divergence between model and data points at either low ( i.e. around 17 - 20kev ) or high energies ( i.e. above 100kev ) .",
    "for instance , in ngc 4945 ( figure  [ ngc4945 ] ) , the first _",
    "point is causing problems to the fit , while in cygnus a ( figure  [ cyga ] ) the problem arises due to the last _ bat _ spectral point . on the other hand , in the circinus galaxy ( figure  [ circinus ] ) ,",
    "_ ibis _ and _ bat _ points track each other perfectly well , but both diverge from the model above 100kev ; given the good agreement between _ ibis _ and _ bat _ spectra , this could be a true feature of the source ( which is of some scientific interest ) or could be due to problems related for example to an incorrect background subtraction .",
    "this is not an uninteresting issue , which we intend to pursue as more data on this source become available . in order to test the aforementioned problem ,",
    "we have refitted all 9 objects using the same approach described in section  [ spec_compl ] , but limiting the analysis to the 20100kev energy range .",
    "we find that the resulting fits become acceptable , at least in one of the various cases of r considered ; the only exception are igr j2124 + 5058 and the circinus galaxy , where the reduced @xmath3 still remains above 1.5 .",
    "inspection of the data - to - model ratios for these two sources indicates that the fits are nonetheless acceptable , suggesting that these may just be the 2 - 3 objects where the reduced @xmath3 is above 1.5 just by chance in a sample of 28 objects . as a final remark",
    ", we note that , in general , the parameter values obtained in this restricted energy range are consistent with those obtained in the 17150kev fits .",

    "in figure  [ g_ecut ] , we show the high energy cut - off ( e@xmath2 ) _ vs. _ the photon index for the agn where these two quantities could be measured ( data are either from table  [ pex_fit1]/ [ pex_fit1_cont ] and [ pex_fit2]/[pex_fit2_cont ] ) ; * in the figure upper panel , we show the parameter space obtained when leaving r as a free parameter in the fits , while in the lower panel , we show the parameter space obtained when r is allow to have only the values of 0 , 1 and 2 . *",
    "different colouring and symbols reflect the different r values assumed and the different agn types analysed .",
    "one thing which is immediately evident is that the two figures are fully compatible , suggesting that the choice of fixing r is acceptable if one wants to have more precise information on a large sample of sources .",
    "the second evident thing is the _ banana _ shape of the space covered by the parameters explored in both plots ; this is a clear sign of the inter - relation between the two analysed quantities , in the sense that flatter spectra provide lower cut - off energies than steeper ones .",
    "this again underlines the difficulties of extracting spectral information from the analysis of narrow band data . from the figure",
    ", it is also evident that the sample covers quite a large range in photon indices as well as cut - off energies ; however , as can be seen in the lower panel of figure  [ g_ecut ] , the spread is due only to a small number of objects ( @xmath19520% of the sample ) while the majority of our agn lies within well defined boundaries of photon index ( 1@xmath0@xmath1@xmath02 ) and cut - off energy ( 30@xmath0e@xmath2@xmath0300kev ) .",
    "in fact , the average power - law photon index and high energy cut - off for all agn where both could be measured are @xmath1 = 1.39 , 1.62 , 1.75 ( @xmath196 = 0.39 in each case ) and e@xmath2 = 215 , 204 , 205 kev ( @xmath196 = 368 , 274 , 295kev ) assuming r = 0 , 1 , and 2 respectively ; note that lower limits on the high energy cut - off have been considered .",
    "our results are in line with _ bepposax _ observations which indicate a spread in e@xmath2 from about 50kev up to around 300kev @xcite ; they also agree with the results of @xcite , but are barely consistent with those obtained by @xcite , who locate the cut - off energy above 200 - 300kev .",
    "the values of @xmath1 and e@xmath2 are linked to the comptonising hot plasma temperature kt@xmath197 and optical depth @xmath198 , according to the relation discussed by @xcite and also analysed by @xcite .",
    "in particular , the plasma temperature kt@xmath197 is estimated as kt@xmath197 = e@xmath2/2 if @xmath198@xmath1951 and kt@xmath197 = e@xmath2/3 if @xmath198@xmath1991 . the most likely range of e@xmath2 estimated in the present sample ( 30 - 300kev ) , indicates a range of plasma temperatures from 10 to 150kev ( or 1.16@xmath20010@xmath201 - 1.74@xmath20010@xmath202k ) . the equation ( solved for both low and high values of @xmath198 and e@xmath2 and assuming our average value of @xmath1=1.65 in the case of r=1 ) has therefore acceptable solutions for @xmath198 in the range @xmath51 to @xmath56 .",
    "these results are in good agreement with what was previously found for a small sample of seyfert 1 galaxies studied by @xcite and @xcite and indicate that the comptonising hot plasma has a typical temperature of 80@xmath20370kev and is mildly thick ( @xmath198@xmath167 ) .",
    "available models should be able to explain and cover the observed range of values .    as a final remark , we also note that synthesis model of the cosmic diffuse background ( cxb ) often assume as an upper limit to the cut - off energy a value of @xmath5200kev ; this choice is basically driven by the intensity and the shape of the cxb spectrum above the peak , which can not be exceeded ; even a value of 300kev has difficulties in accommodating all available observations and cxb measurements @xcite .",
    "thus our analysis agrees and supports this cxb model assumption .",
    "in this work we present the hard x - ray properties of a complete sample of agn using both _ integral / ibis _ and for the majority of the sources also _ swift / bat _ data .",
    "in particular , the main objective of this work is to analyse the cross - calibration between _",
    "ibis _ and _ bat _ , study source variability and constraining some important spectral parameters such as the high energy continuum and its cut - off energy .",
    "the main results found in this paper can be summarised as follows :    * we find that out of 80 sources for which both _",
    "bat _ and _ ibis _ spectra are available , 11 show signs of flux variability .",
    "this result suggests that flux variability is not uncommon at high energies , although it is not very dramatic ( see section  [ var ] ) .",
    "spectral variability is instead quite rare , being found only in one source ( i.e. 3c 273 ) .",
    "* there is general good agreement between _ integral / ibis _ and _ swift / bat _ data , although we find a systematic difference in the normalisation between the two instruments of about 22% .",
    "this is also reflected in the combined fits discussed in section  [ cross_calib ] , where we find that the average cross - calibration constant between _ ibis / bat _ is 1.22 .",
    "* we find , from the combined fits reported in section  [ cross_calib ] , that the average photon index for our sample is around 2 , with quite a narrow spread .",
    "we also find that type 1 and type 2 sources have very similar average photon indices , a clear indication that they are powered by the same mechanism . *",
    "another interesting result is that a simple power - law is not always the most appropriate model to describe high energy data . indeed ,",
    "35% of the sources show signs of spectral complexity ( see section  [ spec_compl ] ) and therefore have to be fitted with a model that takes into account a high energy cut - off and a reflection component . * this more complex model yields a fit improvement in 75% of the sources considered , thus providing evidence for the presence of a high energy component . *",
    "although it is quite hard to constrain at once the high energy continuum , its high energy cut - off and the reflection fraction , it is possible to put constraints on at least two parameters while the other is fixed . by fixing the reflection fraction to be 0 , 1 and 2 , we have been able to determine the parameter space defined by the photon index and the high energy cut - off . *",
    "our sample covers quite a large range in photon indices as well as cut - off energies ; however , the spread is due only to a small number of objects while the majority of the agn lie within well defined boundaries of photon index ( 1@xmath0@xmath1@xmath02 ) and cut - off energy ( 30@xmath0e@xmath2@xmath0300kev ) . *",

    "<S> in this paper , we present the hard x - ray spectral analysis of a complete sample of agn detected by _ integral / ibis_. in conjunction with _ ibis _ spectra , we make use of _ swift / bat _ data , with the aim of cross - calibrating the two instruments , studying source variability and constraining some important spectral parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that flux variability is present in at least 14% of the sample , while spectral variability is found only in one object . </S>",
    "<S> there is general good agreement between _ bat _ and _ ibis _ spectra , despite a systematic mismatch of about 22% in normalisation . </S>",
    "<S> when fitted with a simple power - law model , type 1 and type 2 sources appear to have very similar average photon indices , suggesting that they are powered by the same mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , we also find that a simple power - law does not always describe the data sufficiently well , thus indicating a certain degree of spectral complexity , which can be ascribed to features like a high energy cut - off and/or a reflection component . </S>",
    "<S> fixing the reflection to be 0 , 1 or 2 , we find that our sample covers quite a large range in photon indices as well as cut - off energies ; however , the spread is due only to a small number of objects , while the majority of the agn lie within well defined boundaries of photon index ( 1@xmath0@xmath1@xmath02 ) and cut - off energy ( 30@xmath0e@xmath2@xmath0300kev ) .    </S>",
