    "electron scattering off of spin fluctuations in magnetic metals results in an `` anomalous '' contribution to electric resistivity.@xcite the analysis of this spin - disorder resistivity ( sdr ) is of interest because it can provide material - specific information on the character of spin fluctuations which is not easily accessible by other means .",
    "scattering on spin disorder is also an important factor degrading the performance of magnetoresistive nanostructures in spintronic devices .",
    "the magnitude of the spin - disorder contribution to resistivity is comparable to the phonon contribution near and above the curie temperature @xmath2.@xcite ( magnetic scattering amplitudes have no small parameter unless the local moments are small . ) it is usually assumed that sdr is constant well above @xmath2 . in this region matthiessen s rule is valid , and the phonon contribution can be fitted to the bloch - grneisen formula . the excess resistivity in the whole temperature range may be attributed to spin disorder,@xcite although one may expect deviations from matthiessen s rule at low temperatures where transport is carried by weakly interacting spin channels.@xcite in addition , it was argued that in some cases ( such as ni ) spin disorder may change the character of states on the fermi level and thereby appreciably change the phonon contribution itself.@xcite    many authors have studied sdr theoretically using the @xmath3-@xmath4 model hamiltonian.@xcite in this approach the @xmath5 shells in transition metals ( or @xmath6 shells in rare earth metallic magnets ) are assumed to be localized at atomic sites and partially filled , forming magnetic moments @xmath7 that are coupled to the current - carrying conduction electrons by exchange interaction @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the local @xmath3-@xmath4 exchange coupling constant and @xmath10 the spin - density operator of the conduction electrons at site @xmath11 .",
    "thermal fluctuations of the @xmath4-electron spins generate an inhomogeneous exchange potential ; in the born approximation the sdr is then determined by the conduction electron band structure and the spin - spin correlation functions of @xmath4-electron spins.@xcite if the scattering is approximated as being elastic , only equal - time spin correlators have to be considered .",
    "further , if the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) is used for @xmath5 spin statistics , the sdr behaves as @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 is the magnetization at temperature @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite note that above @xmath2 sdr is constant and equal to @xmath16 .",
    "the shape of the fermi surface of conduction electrons is immaterial to this prediction as long as the scattering is elastic .",
    "@xcite    the effects of magnetic short - range order ( msro ) on sdr have also been investigated within the @xmath3-@xmath4 model .",
    "@xcite this problem has attracted considerable attention in connection with a `` bump '' in the resistivity that is observed near @xmath2 in some magnetic metals ( although it is usually quite small).@xcite the analysis of critical msro effects showed that a cusp may appear near @xmath2 due to long - wave critical fluctuations,@xcite although it should usually be strongly suppressed by finite mean - free path and cancelations due to fermi surface integration.@xcite it was also found that the effect of msro and even its sign are sensitive to such details of the model as the conduction band occupation and the form of the scattering ( pseudo)potential.@xcite    although the @xmath3-@xmath4 model provided physical insight into the mechanism of sdr , it suffers from serious limitations .",
    "first , the distinction between localized and conduction electrons is not justified in transition metals where @xmath5 electrons are itinerant and form the fermi surface .",
    "even if the current is dominated by light @xmath3-like bands that can be distinguished from heavy @xmath4-like bands , the relaxation rate is dominated by interband ( @xmath3-@xmath4 ) scattering .",
    "@xcite second , at elevated temperatures the scattering potential generated by spin disorder is of the order of the exchange splitting , which is not small compared to the bandwidth .",
    "this invalidates the born approximation which is usually made in model calculations .",
    "third , the @xmath3-@xmath4 model does not properly take into account the change of electronic structure due to disorder .",
    "the first - principles approach to sdr is free from all these limitations and can be used for quantitative calculations of sdr .",
    "this is of particular interest for the theory of itinerant magnets , because , as mentioned above , sdr depends on spin - spin correlation functions . different theories of itinerant magnetism make conflicting predictions for such properties as the degree of msro , the mean - squared magnetic moment , and their temperature dependence;@xcite these quantities are quite hard to measure directly . by calculating sdr for a particular model of spin fluctuations and comparing the results with experiment , one can attempt to validate or rule out different spin - fluctuation models .",
    "earlier we have calculated the temperature dependence of sdr in fe and ni using supercell calculations within the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) method using the mean - field distribution for spin orientation statistics .",
    "@xcite good agreement with experiment was obtained for fe , but for paramagnetic ni the sdr was found to be significantly overestimated . in this paper",
    "we analyze the temperature dependence of sdr for fe and ni in greater detail and consider the effects of magnetic ordering , msro , and local moment reduction .",
    "we also study the importance of the basis set size and self - consistency of the atomic potentials .",
    "our approach is based on noncollinear density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "all the valence electrons are treated on the same footing , while the scattering potentials are determined by the self - consistent electron charge and spin densities .",
    "we use the tb - lmto method @xcite which represents the electronic density of the crystal as a superposition of overlapping atomic spheres ; the electronic density inside each sphere is spherically symmetric .",
    "this method is known to work very well in close - packed materials , and it allows us to introduce spin disorder in various ways . in this work we used the rigid spin approximation which assumes that the spin density in each atomic sphere remains collinear , while the spin densities of different atomic spheres become noncollinear at finite temperatures . in the simplest model the electron charge and spin densities in all atomic spheres",
    "are taken from the ground state and frozen , while the directions of the spin moments in different spheres are randomized with the angular distribution function taken from mfa at the given temperature .",
    "this model is expected to work reasonably well for fe which has a fairly stable local moment.@xcite in section [ mfa ] we show that this is indeed the case ; however , for ni the paramagnetic sdr calculated in this way is about twice too large . in order to explain this discrepancy , the dependence of sdr on the degree of msro and on the magnitude of the local moment is studied in sections [ msro ] and [ reduc ] .",
    "we use the supercell approach and calculate the areal conductance of a layer of spin - disordered metal fm(d ) sandwiched between fully ordered semi - infinite leads fm(o ) made of the same metal ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the resistivity is then proportional to the slope of the inverse conductance as a function of the disordered layer thickness , once the ohmic limit is reached . for the given thickness of the fm(d ) layer ,",
    "the conductance of the system was averaged over several disorder configurations ( typically 15 ) .",
    "the planar system is represented by a laterally periodic prism with an axis along the [ 001 ] crystallographic direction , and care is taken to make sure that the conductance scales as the cross - section of the prism . to calculate the conductance we use the principal - layer green s function technique @xcite and the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite in the implementation allowing for noncollinearity in the active region.@xcite this technique was employed before to study the effects of substitutional disorder on transport in magnetic multilayers ; @xcite it is similar to the supercell kubo - greenwood method used to calculate the residual resistivity of binary alloys.@xcite        if the atomic potentials in the supercell are not converged to self - consistency with the given spin disorder configuration , care needs to be taken to ensure local charge neutrality .",
    "indeed , fm(d ) and fm(o ) materials have different fermi levels that must normally be matched by the contact voltage . in order to enforce charge neutrality in the fm(d ) region ,",
    "a constant potential shift was introduced in this region so that the charge in the central part of fm(d ) averaged over disorder realizations was zero .",
    "this potential shift plays the role of the contact voltage .",
    "note that no matter how the fm(o)/fm(d ) interfaces are treated ( self - consistently or not ) , they add contact resistances to the circuit",
    ". however , since the _ resistivity _ of the fm(d ) material is extracted from the thickness dependence of the resistance in the ohmic limit , the simplified treatment of interfaces has no effect on the results .",
    "in this section we analyze the temperature dependence of sdr for iron and nickel using mfa for thermal spin disorder ; the spin - spin correlator is purely local in this approximation .",
    "first we consider the paramagnetic state where the angular distribution function is isotropic , and the resulting sdr is temperature - independent .",
    "we need to make a physically reasonable choice of atomic potentials for the conductance calculations .",
    "it is known that the local moments in fe are quite stable;@xcite in particular , the dlm method , which employs the coherent potential approximation for spin - disordered states , shows only a small reduction of the local moment in paramagnetic fe compared to its ground - state value.@xcite as seen below , direct averaging of self - consistent local moments in the paramagnetic states gives a similar result .",
    "therefore , for fe it is reasonable to use frozen atomic potentials taken from the zero - temperature ground state in all calculations .",
    "we have also checked the effect of self - consistency on sdr in fe and found it to be small ( see below ) .",
    "the situation is entirely different for ni , where the local moment depends on the magnetic state ; in particular , it vanishes altogether in the paramagnetic dlm approximation .",
    "@xcite since longitudinal spin fluctuations ( that are absent in our approach ) can at least partially restore the local moments , @xcite it is not _ a priori _ clear how the atomic potentials should be modified for ni . in this section",
    "we use frozen atomic potentials ; the necessary corrections are discussed later .    fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the inverse areal conductance for paramagnetic fe and ni as a function of the disordered fm(d ) region thickness .",
    "here we used the frozen ground - state atomic potentials and the lmto basis including @xmath3 , @xmath17 , and @xmath4 orbitals ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the supercell cross - sections contained @xmath19 ( for fe ) and @xmath20 ( for ni ) cubic unit cells with edges oriented along the [ 100 ] directions .",
    "almost perfect ohmic behavior is apparent for both fe and ni , which establishes the validity of our approach .     of the fm(o)/fm(d)/fm(o ) systems as a function of the fm(d ) layer thickness for bcc fe",
    "( black filled symbols ) and fcc ni ( red or gray empty symbols ) obtained with @xmath18 .",
    "circles and squares correspond , respectively , to the paramagnetic state and to the lowest temperature for which the calculations were made .",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 supercells were used for fe and ni , respectively , with edges along the [ 100 ] directions .",
    "straight lines show the linear fitting ; error bars are smaller than the size of the symbols.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    table  [ tab1 ] lists the values of sdr found for paramagnetic fe and ni using different supercell cross - sections , lmto bases truncated at @xmath18 and @xmath21 ( the latter includes @xmath6 orbitals ) , as well as the value found using self - consistent ( rather than frozen ) atomic potentials for fe .",
    "it is seen that the results are well converged with respect to the supercell cross - section , and even @xmath22 supercells provide sufficient accuracy .",
    "this is reasonable because the mean - free path in the paramagnetic state is small .",
    ".spin - disorder resistivity in @xmath23 cm for paramagnetic bcc fe and fcc ni .",
    "the calculated values are given for basis sets with @xmath18 and 3 , as well as for different lateral cell sizes with edges along the [ 100 ] directions .",
    "sc denotes calculations with self - consistent potentials .",
    "standard deviations of sdr due to limited disorder sampling are included .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "numerous previous studies @xcite based on the @xmath3-@xmath4 model concluded that sdr in the paramagnetic state is essentially proportional to @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the spin of the partially filled @xmath5 shell .",
    "this dependence is easy to understand based on the fermi golden rule with averaging over the initial states of the @xmath5 spin . in our treatment based on noncollinear dft",
    ", the exchange - correlation field with randomized directions on different sites plays the role of the @xmath3-@xmath4 hamiltonian .",
    "however , contrary to the @xmath3-@xmath4 model , the @xmath5 spin is treated classically , i.  e.  @xmath26 is just a classical vector and not an operator .",
    "the fermi golden rule in our case would give a paramagnetic sdr proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "thus , if the @xmath28 factor were correct , noncollinear dft calculations would underestimate the paramagnetic sdr by a factor @xmath1 .",
    "this factor is close to 2 for fe and more than 3 for ni . in reality , the calculated sdr agrees well with experiment for fe and is _ _",
    "over__estimated for ni ( if the local moment reduction is not included ) .",
    "we believe that these results provide clear evidence against the @xmath28 factor which appears if the local moments are treated as local atomic spins . instead , the classical description of the local magnetic fluctuations in the spirit of the dlm approach is supported by our results .",
    "we suggest that the itinerancy of the @xmath5 electrons is crucial for this behavior .",
    "qualitatively , one can argue that the low - energy fluctuations in fe or ni on the scale of @xmath29 ( which the resistivity is most sensitive to ) are similar to classical rotations of the local moments rather than quantum fluctuations of localized spins",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate this issue for magnets with a varying degree of localization , including rare - earth systems .",
    "some poorly controlled assumptions are involved in the extraction of @xmath30 from the experimental data.@xcite first , it is assumed that @xmath30 is constant in the wide temperature range above @xmath2 where the total resistivity is linear in @xmath14 .",
    "this assumption implies that the local moments ( or at least their mean - squared average ) are constant in this range .",
    "spin fluctuation theories for itinerant metals show that the local moments may change with temperature above @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite such change will contribute to the slope of @xmath31 above @xmath2 , and hence the separation of @xmath30 from the phonon contribution would be inaccurate .",
    "on the other hand , it has been argued that the phonon contribution to the resistivity may be sensitive to spin disorder , because the latter may change the character of states at the fermi level.@xcite in particular , in ni the filled majority - spin @xmath4 states may be lifted up to the fermi level by spin disorder , thereby facilitating interband @xmath3-@xmath4 scattering by phonons .",
    "this effect may therefore introduce an unusual temperature dependence of the phonon contribution , which makes spin disorder and phonon effects non - additive , even if the scattering rates themselves obey matthiessen s rule . since we have not studied this effect here",
    ", our comparison of sdr with experiment for ni is incomplete .",
    "however , the phonon contribution can be expected to follow the bloch - grneisen form above @xmath2 with the electron - phonon scattering renormalized by spin disorder ; therefore , the influence of spin disorder on the phonon contribution should not invalidate the procedure used for subtracting this contribution above @xmath2 .    in conclusion",
    ", we have calculated the spin - disorder resistivity of fe and ni in the whole temperature range up to @xmath2 using both the mean - field approximation and the nearest - neighbor heisenberg model to represent the canonical ensemble of classical spin configurations .",
    "we found that sdr is insensitive to the magnetic short - range order ( msro ) in fe and ni .",
    "the sdr in fe depends linearly on @xmath32 which implies that the main effect of spin disorder is to introduce scattering , which is proportional to the variance of the random potential . for ni",
    "the calculated temperature dependence is more complicated ; at elevated temperatures close to @xmath2 the sdr grows faster than expected .",
    "this faster increase of sdr may be explained by the reduction of the exchange splitting which lifts the heavy bands up to the fermi level , thereby increasing the scattering rate .",
    "the results for fe are in very good agreement with experiment if the atomic potentials are taken from zero temperature and frozen , but for ni the sdr calculated in this way is strongly overestimated .",
    "this disagreement is attributed to the reduction of the local magnetic moment in ni .",
    "comparison with experimental sdr leads to a value of @xmath0 above @xmath2 , which may be compared with experiment .",
