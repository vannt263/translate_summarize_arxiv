    "narrow roads with excluded volume interactions between vehicles having no possibility of overtaking , are well - described by the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep )  @xcite .",
    "important phenomenological questions about traffic networks include how defects ( both extended and point ) along a road may control the density profiles and currents in the steady states .",
    "we concern ourselves in exploring these issues in terms of a simple model in this paper .    in order to focus on the essential physics of the system",
    ", we consider a minimal closed directed network ( hereafter model i ) consisting of just three segments , with each executing tasep , two of them ( marked @xmath0 and @xmath1 in fig .  [ fig : model1 ] ) being parallelly and the third one ( @xmath2 ) anti - parallelly attached to the multiply connected left ( @xmath3 ) and right ( @xmath4 ) junctions .",

    "therefore , @xmath2 acts like an ( extended ) bottleneck in the system . while in general the length of an extended defect is not necessarily same as the lengths of either of the parallel channels , but for simplicity we take all of them to have the same length with equal number of lattice sites .",
    "although the branching of particles at @xmath3 is controlled by a parameter @xmath5 , at @xmath4 there is no analogous control parameter .",
    "there have been a number of applications of tasep and tasep - like models in studies on directed vehicular traffic along roads , studying various physical aspects of traffic jam described as tasep or tasep - like systems .",
    "for instance , the nagel - schreckenberg model , closely related to tasep , has been proposed as a theoretical description for freeway traffic .",

    "however , if there are two ldws in the system , it is clear that an arbitrary shift in the position of one of the ldws , together with a compensating reverse shift of the position of the second ldw keeps the total particle number conserved .",

    "now putting those values in the current conservation equation we have , @xmath161 now enforcing hd phase for @xmath0 , we have the phase boundary ( a horizontal line ) in the ( @xmath156)-plane , as shown for @xmath113 in fig .  [ phase_mft_2 ] .",
    "at the transition @xmath162 and at @xmath3 we have @xmath163 now from overall current conservation , @xmath164 from eq .",
    "( [ hdldmc - hdldhd-1 ] ) and particle number conservation @xmath165 equation  ( [ hdldmc - hdldhd-2 ] ) gives the corresponding phase boundary in the ( @xmath156)-plane as shown fig .",
    "[ phase_mft_2 ] .      set @xmath162 for this transition . then at the @xmath3 @xmath166 from overall current conservation we write , @xmath167 particle number conservation together with eq .",
    "( [ ldhdmc - ldhdhd-1 ] ) yield @xmath168 equation ( [ ldhdmc - ldhdhd-2 ] ) gives the corresponding phase boundary in ( @xmath156)-plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ phase_mft_2 ] .",
    "we now compare and contrast the results from model i and model ii .",
    "this will allow us to understand the extent to which the point defects at @xmath4 can affect the phases .",
    "first of all , the phase diagram fig .",
    "[ phase_mft ] for model i is symmetric about the line @xmath169 whereas there is no such symmetry in the phase diagram fig .",
    "[ phase_mft_2 ] for model ii in general , due to the point defects at @xmath97    in model ii there are some phases which has no analogue in model i , for example dw - ld - ld phase .",
    "let us consider this phase where the bls are at the two opposite junctions , at @xmath4 for @xmath1 and at @xmath3 for @xmath42 at @xmath4 the current matching conditions between @xmath0 and @xmath2 gives , @xmath170 now use the condition for retrieving model i from model ii given by @xmath171 then from eq .",
    "( [ dwldld_m1 - 1 ] ) @xmath172 put this in the overall current conservation equation , @xmath173 to get , @xmath174 , implying @xmath175 or 1 , which is unfeasible .",
    "thus , the assumption of the existence of the phase dw - ld - ld in model i is not correct ; therefore , we conclude that dw - ld - ld phase does not appear for model i. similar arguments show that hd - ld - ld and hd - ld - dw phases are also absent for model i. these observations are clearly validated by our mcs studies on model i , as displayed in fig .",
    "( [ phase_mft ] ) . evidently , the phases which appear only in model ii are solely due to the point defect at @xmath97 furthermore , the ddws in model i should be fully overlapping ( under long time averages ; not shown in fig  [ fig : ddw ] ) , a feature consistent with the symmetry of model i about @xmath176 in contrast , the ddws in model ii are generally non - overlapping ( even under long time averages ) , due to the lack of any special symmetry in model ii as seen in fig .",
    "[ ddw_m2 ] .",
    "these differences are connected to the fact that in model i by construction , ddws in @xmath0 and @xmath1 correspond to @xmath177 in model ii however there are no such equalities , due to the presence of the point defect at @xmath4 .",
    "a related consequence is that model i displays ddws only for @xmath169 where as in model ii , it is possible to have ddws for arbitrary @xmath5 so long as the general conditions for ddws are met .",
    "overall , thus , the effect of introducing point defects at @xmath4 is not only to change the locations of the phases in the @xmath48 phase diagram qualitatively , but also to introduce new phases which were absent in model i. thus , the topology the phase diagram gets affected .",
    "the limiting cases of model ii reveal interesting features . for instance , when @xmath5 and @xmath178 are either @xmath179 or @xmath29 simultaneously then by construction either @xmath0 or @xmath1 is fully blocked .",
    "the remaining system then has equal hopping rate at every site .",
    "thus , the average density at every site is just @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , if say @xmath5 is @xmath29 or @xmath179 with @xmath180 having a value between zero and unity , then the junction @xmath4 effectively serves as a point defect in an otherwise homogeneous ring executing tasep .",
    "for instance , consider @xmath181 thus eliminating @xmath1 and allowing for a point defect at @xmath4 , given by a reduced hopping rate @xmath182 in this limit our model is identical to the model in ref .",
    "@xcite and our results in this limit @xmath183 are in agreement with that .    _",
