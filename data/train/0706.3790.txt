    "the measurement of the top quark properties allows one to verify the consistency of the standard model . at the fermilab tevatron collider top quarks",
    "are produced mostly in pairs and the measurement of the @xmath7 cross section tests the next - to - leading - order qcd calculations . moreover , accurate measurements of the top quark mass and of the mass of the @xmath8 boson provide constraints on the mass of the hypothetical standard model higgs boson@xcite .    at the tevatron center - of - mass energy , @xmath9tev , the predicted @xmath7 production cross section is 6.7pb@xcite for an assumed top quark mass of 175  gev/@xmath10 , with a total theoretical uncertainty of approximately 15% , due to the choice of renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "the top quark decays into a @xmath8 boson and a @xmath3 quark almost 100% of the time ; the @xmath8 boson subsequently decays to either a quark - antiquark pair or a lepton - neutrino pair .",
    "the resulting final states are then usually distinguished by the number of charged energetic leptons ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) and the number of jets .    in this analysis , we examine events characterized by a multijet topology and no energetic lepton ( `` all - hadronic '' mode ) .",
    "this @xmath0 final state has the advantage of a large branching ratio ( @xmath13 ) and of having no undetected top decay physical observables in the final state .",
    "in addition , discrepancies in top quark cross section and mass measurements between this and other decay channels could indicate contributions from physics beyond the standard model@xcite .",
    "the major challenge of this channel is the very large qcd multijet background which dominates the signal by three orders of magnitude after the application of the online trigger selection . to improve the signal - to - background ratio ( s / b ) ,",
    "requirements based on the kinematical and topological characteristics of standard model @xmath7 events are expressed in terms of a neural network and applied to the data .",
    "this neural network selection reaches a s / b of about 1/12 , improving the s / b by @xmath14 with respect to the selection based on kinematical cuts used in previous analyses@xcite .",
    "the neural network selection is followed by the requirement of jets identified as originating from @xmath3 quarks using a secondary vertex @xmath3-tagging algorithm , achieving a s / b of about 1/2 .",
    "the purity of the selected sample enables the clear observation of @xmath0 candidates and the measurement of the @xmath0 production cross section and of the top quark mass .",
    "top quark events result in final states with a number of @xmath3-tagged jets larger than in inclusive qcd multijet production , so we use the excess of such tags to measure the @xmath0 production cross section . a reconstructed top quark mass",
    "is then determined from a kinematical fit of the six leading jets in the event to a @xmath0 final state .",
    "the distribution of reconstructed top quark masses is then compared to the distributions expected from background and @xmath0 events simulated at various values of the top quark mass , to obtain the value which best describes the data .",
    "given the theoretical uncertainties on the production cross section for events generated with n partons at tree level , a more accurate background estimate is obtained from the data themselves ( `` data - driven '' ) rather than from theoretical prediction of cross section and simulations .",
    "the cdf and d collaborations previously measured the @xmath7 production cross section and the top quark mass in the all - hadronic channel@xcite using datasets with integrated luminosities of approximately 110pb@xmath1 collected at @xmath15tev during the tevatron run i ( 1992 - 1996 ) .",
    "more recent run ii measurements of the cross section@xcite and mass@xcite have been performed by cdf using 311pb@xmath1 collected with the cdf ii detector at @xmath16tev ( march 2002 - august 2004 ) .",
    "the results reported here are based on the data taken between march 2002 and february 2006 , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath17  fb@xmath1 .",
    "these measurements complement other recent @xmath0 cross section and top quark mass determinations by cdf@xcite and d@xcite in other final states .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : section[sec : detector ] contains a brief description of the cdfii detector .",
    "the trigger and the neural - network - based sample selection are described in section[sec : dataset ] .",
    "the @xmath3-tagging algorithm and its efficiency for identifying @xmath3 jets are described in section[sec : btag ] . in section[sec : bkg ] the data - driven method we use for estimating the background from experimental multijet data is applied and the related systematic uncertainties are evaluated .",
    "section[sec : optim ] describes the optimization of the kinematical selection and the associated efficiency .",
    "the @xmath7 production cross section is presented in section[sec : xs ] .",
    "the reconstruction of the top quark mass and the corresponding background and signal distributions are described in section[sec : chi2 ] ; the method for fitting these distributions is discussed in section[sec : like ] .",
    "section [ sec : masssyst ] summarizes the expected contributions to the systematic uncertainty on the top quark mass measurement , while section [ sec : mass ] describes the top quark mass measurement .",
    "finally , cross section and mass measurements are summarized in section[sec : fine ] .",
    "the cdfii detector@xcite is an azimuthally and forward - backward symmetric apparatus designed to study @xmath2 collisions at the tevatron .",
    "a cylindrical coordinate system as described in@xcite is used .",
    "the detector consists of a magnetic spectrometer surrounded by calorimeters and muon chambers .",
    "the charged particle tracking system is immersed in a 1.4  t solenoidal magnetic field with axis parallel to the beamline .",
    "a set of silicon microstrip detectors provides charged particle tracking in the radial range from 1.5 to 28  cm , while a 3.1  m long open - cell drift chamber , the central outer tracker ( cot ) , covers the radial range from 40 to 137 cm . in combination",
    "the silicon and cot detectors provide excellent tracking up to about pseudorapidities@xcite @xmath18 , with decreasing coverage up to @xmath19 .",
    "segmented electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters surround the tracking system and measure the energy of interacting particles .",
    "the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters are lead - scintillator and iron - scintillator sampling devices , respectively , covering the range @xmath20 .",
    "they are segmented in the central region ( @xmath21 ) in towers of 15@xmath22 in azimuth and 0.1 in @xmath23 , and in the forward region ( @xmath24 ) in towers of 7.5@xmath22 for @xmath25 and 15@xmath22 for @xmath26 .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeters@xcite are instrumented with proportional and scintillating strip detectors that measure the transverse profile of electromagnetic showers at a depth corresponding to the expected shower maximum .",
    "drift chambers located outside the central hadronic calorimeters and behind a 60  cm iron shield detect muons with @xmath27@xcite .",
    "additional drift chambers and scintillation counters detect muons in the region @xmath28 .",
    "gas cherenkov counters@xcite with a coverage of @xmath29 measure the average number of inelastic @xmath2 collisions and thereby determine the luminosity .",
    "the all - hadronic final state of @xmath7 events is characterized by the presence of at least six jets from the decay of the two top quarks .",
    "collisions are selected in real time using a multijet trigger , relying on calorimeter information , which was specially developed to collect the events used in this analysis .",
    "subsequently , jets are identified off - line by grouping clusters of energy in the calorimeter using a fixed - cone algorithm with a radius 0.4 in @xmath30 space@xcite .",
    "the typical jet transverse energy@xcite resolution is approximately @xmath31 gev@xcite , where @xmath32 is the jet transverse energy in gev . after a preliminary selection of multijet events , a neural network selection based on relevant kinematical variables",
    "is used to provide the most precise cross section and mass measurements .",
    "the cdf trigger system has three levels .",
    "the first two levels consist of special - purpose electronics and the third one of conventional digital processors . for triggering purposes the calorimeter granularity",
    "is simplified to a @xmath33 grid in @xmath30 space with each `` trigger tower '' spanning approximately 15@xmath22 in @xmath34 and 0.2 in @xmath23 covering one or two physical towers . at level 1",
    ", the jet trigger requires a single tower with transverse energy @xmath35  gev . at level 2",
    "we require that the total transverse energy , summed over all the trigger towers , @xmath36 , be @xmath37  gev , and the presence of four or more clusters of calorimeter towers , each cluster with transverse energy @xmath38  gev . in order to maintain an acceptable trigger rate , as the peak instantaneous luminosity increased",
    ", the @xmath36 threshold has been increased over the course of the data taking , 175 gev being the latest value .",
    "this threshold has been applied , off - line , to the whole data set .",
    "finally , the third trigger level confirms the level 2 selection using a more accurate determination of the jet energy , requiring four or more reconstructed jets with @xmath39  gev .",
    "a total of 4340143 events satisfy the trigger requirements , with an efficiency of about 58% for inclusive @xmath7 events , and of 80% for all - hadronic @xmath7 events .",
    "the efficiency has been estimated using monte carlo generated @xmath0 events , described later .",
    "this corresponds to the s / b of approximately 1/1100 for the theoretical cross section of @xmath40  pb , where the background is represented by the multijet events themselves .",
    "events satisfying the trigger requirements are reconstructed in terms of their final state observables ( tracks , vertices , charged leptons , jets ) .",
    "we retain only those events that are well contained in detector acceptance , requiring the primary event vertex@xcite to lie inside the luminous region ( @xmath41  cm ) .",
    "the jet energies are corrected for detector response and multiple interactions .",
    "first , we take into account the @xmath23-dependence of detector response and energy loss in the uninstrumented regions . after a small correction for the extra energy deposited by multiple collisions in the same beam - beam bunch crossing , a correction for calorimeter non - linearity",
    "is applied so that the jet energies correspond , on average , to the energy of all the particles incident on the jet cone .",
    "all systematic uncertainties for the individual corrections are added in quadrature to obtain the total uncertainty on the estimate of the initial parton energy .",
    "this uncertainty goes from 8% to 3% with jet transverse energy increasing from 15 gev to 50 gev , and remains approximately constant at 3% above 50 gev@xcite .    for this analysis",
    ", each jet is required to have @xmath42  gev and @xmath43 after all corrections have been applied . in order to remove the events from the @xmath7 leptonic channels , we veto events containing any well identified high-@xmath44 electrons and muons as defined in@xcite , and require that @xmath45 be @xmath46@xmath47@xcite , where the missing transverse energy , @xmath48@xcite , is computed with reference to the detector origin and is corrected for any identified muons and the position of the @xmath2 collision point , while @xmath49 is obtained by summing the @xmath32 s of all the selected jets . at this stage ,",
    "called `` preselection '' , simulations show that the fraction of leptonic events amounts to about 14% of all accepted @xmath0 events . to avoid overlaps between jets we require jet pairs to be separated by at least 0.5 units in the @xmath30 space . about 3.5 million events pass these preselection requirements ( s / b @xmath50 ) .",
    "finally , we define the topology of the signal region by selecting events with a number of jets @xmath51 to optimize the signal fraction .",
    "506567 events pass this additional requirement with an expected s / b of approximately 1/370 , i.e. about 0.3% ; the remaining events with lower jet multiplicity have much smaller values of s / b and are used as control regions .",
    "the residual fraction of leptonic @xmath7 events amounts to only 5% of all accepted events .      in order to further improve the s / b we use a neural network approach to recognize in more detail the features of signal and background events , including correlations between the kinematical variables which enter as input nodes in the network .",
    "we thus expect a better separation between signal and background relative to the former technique@xcite where correlations were not fully considered .",
    "the network uses the mlpfit package@xcite as implemented by root@xcite through the _ tmultilayerperceptron _ class .",
    "we define a kinematical selection based on dynamical and topological properties of the candidate event .",
    "the number of variables used should allow the best possible description of the event properties , but , at the same time , too many input variables can worsen the performance , given the limited training statistics . as a guideline we studied different neural network configurations , in terms of inputs and hidden nodes , adding a few variables at a time , looking for the best performance in terms of largest s / b .",
    "the first quantities considered are those used in@xcite : the total transverse energy of the jets , @xmath52 ; the quantity @xmath53 , obtained by removing the contribution of the two jets with the highest @xmath54 ; the centrality , defined as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the invariant mass of the multijet system ; and the aplanarity @xmath57 , defined as @xmath58 , @xmath59 being the smallest of the three normalized eigenvalues of the sphericity tensor , @xmath60 , calculated in the center - of - mass system of all jets , where the indices @xmath61 and @xmath3 refer to the spatial components of the jet four - momentum @xmath62 . in addition , we consider the dynamical properties of dijet and trijet systems through the use of the minimum and maximum value of the invariant mass among all possible jet permutations : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we obtain another set of discriminating variables combining the transverse energy of the jets with their emission direction , represented by the angle @xmath67 between the jet direction , as measured in the center - of - mass frame of all jets , and the proton beam axis .",
    "the variable @xmath68 has been shown@xcite to have discriminating power against the background , and we use here the quantity @xmath69 which tends to have larger values in the signal in comparison to the background events ; this effect is enhanced for the jets with higher @xmath32 .",
    "the variables we choose as additional inputs to the neural network are then @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the two highest-@xmath32 jets , and @xmath72 defined as the geometric mean over the remaining @xmath73 jets .",
    "the 11 variables used as inputs to the neural network are summarized in table[tab : nnvar ] .",
    "comparisons of the background - dominated data and monte carlo generated signal events for the 11 kinematical variables are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : kinsel1a ] to [ fig : kinsel3 ] .",
    "the network is trained on same - size samples of signal and background events with @xmath51 ( about 507000 events ) . in order to model the signal we use the pythiav6.2@xcite leading - order monte carlo generator with parton showering followed by a simulation of the cdf ii detector .",
    "the reference top quark mass chosen for the training is @xmath74gev/@xmath10 .",
    "the background is obtained from the multijet data events themselves , since the signal fraction at the initial stage is expected to be very small . among the configurations investigated , the one which provides the largest expected s / b has two hidden layers with 20 and 10 hidden nodes , respectively , and 1 output node .",
    "the value of the output node , @xmath75 , is the quantity we use as discriminator between signal and background , as shown in fig.[fig : nnout ] for the @xmath76 sample .",

    "after the kinematical selection with @xmath77 , the @xmath3-tagging requirement and the cut on the goodness of the fit , @xmath78 , we find 926 tags in 772 events .",
    "the background , corrected as in the cross section measurement for the contamination of @xmath0 events ( see section[sec : optim ] ) , amounts to @xmath79 tags .",
    "the likelihood fit is applied to the data sample to derive @xmath80 gev / c@xmath6 .",
    "the plot in fig.[fig : topmeas ] shows the fitted top quark mass distribution for the data compared to the expected background and the signal for a top quark mass of 174.0 gev / c@xmath6 . the plot in fig.[fig : sigma ]",

    "we find that the p - value for our statistical uncertainty is @xmath82 . as for the case of the cross section measurement ,",
    "monte carlo simulations indicate the need to increase the statistical uncertainties by 5% to account for the use of multiple entries , one for each tag in the same event , and their correlations .    as a last check , we perform the measurement removing from the likelihood definition the gaussian term which constrains the number of background tags to be as predicted via the tag rate parameterization , and we obtain nearly the same value , @xmath83 gev / c@xmath6 .    the measurement presented here is the most precise measurement to date of the top quark mass in the all - hadronic decay channel . the result is consistent with the measurements obtained in the same channel at @xmath15 tev @xcite , with the measurement obtained at @xmath16 tev using @xmath84 pb@xmath1 of data with a different technique @xcite , and with the results obtained in the other channels by cdf@xcite and d@xcite collaborations .    ,",
