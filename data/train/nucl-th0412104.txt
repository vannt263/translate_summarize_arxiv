    "the double beta decay of a ( z , n ) nucleus , may take place through two distinct channels . for one channel , the final state consists of the residual nucleus ( z+2,n-2 ) , two electrons and two antineutrinos , while for the other one the final state is lacking the antineutrinos .",
    "suggestively , the two decay modes are called two neutrinos double beta ( @xmath0 ) and neutrinoless ( @xmath3 ) double beta decay , respectively .",
    "the second mode is especially interesting since its discovery may provide a definite answer to the question whether neutrino is a dirac or majorana particle .",
    "the @xmath0 process is interesting by its own but also due to the fact that may provide realistic nuclear matrix elements which might be further used to quantitatively evaluate the rate of the neutrinoless double beta decay .    for such reasons many theoreticians focused their efforts in describing consistently the data for @xmath0 decay .",
    "the contributions over several decades have been reviewed by many authors . instead of enumerating the main steps achieved toward improving the theoretical description we advise the reader to consult a few of the review works @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , most of the double beta emitters are deformed nuclei , the proposed formalisms use a single particle spherical basis .",
    "more than 10 years ago , one of us @xcite proposed a formalism to describe the process of two neutrinos double beta decay in a projected spherical basis .",
    "it was for the first time that a proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation ( pnqrpa ) for a two body interaction in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels with a deformed single particle basis was performed .",
    "moreover , effects which are beyond pnqrpa , have been accounted for by means of a boson expansion procedure .",
    "few years later the influence of nuclear deformation upon the contribution of the spin - flip configurations to the gamow - teller double beta transition amplitude , was studied @xcite . in the meantime",
    "several papers have been devoted to the extension of the pnqrpa procedure to deformed nuclei , the applications being performed for studying the single beta decay properties as well as the double beta decay rates .",
    "thus , pnqrpa approaches using as deformed single particle basis nilsson or deformed woods saxon states have been formulated@xcite .",
    "also , a self - consistent deformed method was formulated where the single particle basis was obtained as eigenstates of a deformed mean field defined through a hartree - fock treatment of a density dependent two body interaction of skyrme type @xcite .    in a recent publication",
    "@xcite we continued the project opened in ref.@xcite , by improving the single particle basis .",
    "indeed , in ref.@xcite the single particle energies were depending linearly on a parameter which simulates the nuclear deformation .",
    "by contrast , in ref .",
    "@xcite the core volume conservation constraint , ignored in the previous paper , determines a nonlinear deformation dependence for single particle energies . of course , having different single particle energies , the pairing properties and the double beta matrix elements",
    "are expected to be modified .",
    "another issue addressed in the previous paper was whether considering different deformations for the mother and daughter nuclei , modifies significantly the double beta transition amplitude ( m@xmath6 ) .",
    "the answer to this question is positive since modifying the deformation for the daughter nucleus , the ground state correlations are modified and consequently the pnqrpa collapse point is changed . on the other hand the overlap matrix elements of the states describing the intermediate odd - odd nucleus , defined as excited states from the mother and daughter ground states respectively , are decreased .",
    "therefore , considering different nuclear deformations for mother and daughter nuclei quenches the gamow - teller ( gt ) double beta decay amplitude , which results in improving the agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the angular momentum projected spherical basis enables a unified description of spherical and deformed nuclei .",
    "here we use this virtue of the single particle basis defined in ref.@xcite and try to depict the specific features of the transitions between nuclei of similar or different nuclear shapes : a ) spherical @xmath7 spherical ( @xmath8ca @xmath7 @xmath8ti ) , b ) spherical @xmath9deformed - prolate ( @xmath10te @xmath7 @xmath10xe , @xmath11te @xmath7 @xmath11xe ) , c ) spherical @xmath9deformed- oblate ( @xmath12xe @xmath7 @xmath12ba , @xmath13xe @xmath7 @xmath13ba ) , d ) deformed @xmath9spherical ( @xmath14pd @xmath7 @xmath15cd ) , e ) deformed - prolate@xmath9deformed - prolate ( @xmath16zr@xmath9 @xmath16mo ) , f ) deformed - oblate@xmath9 deformed - oblate ( @xmath17mo @xmath9 @xmath17ru , @xmath18ru @xmath9@xmath18pd , @xmath19cd @xmath9 @xmath19sn ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that except for @xmath18ru , @xmath14pd and @xmath12xe for all other cases experimental data are available .",
    "the results of the present paper will be described according to the following plan . for the sake of a self - sustaining presentation , a brief review of the projected spherical single particle basis will be presented in section ii .",
    "also , the basic equations necessary for calculating the gt double beta transition amplitude are given . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the results for ten double beta emitters : @xmath8ca , @xmath16zr , @xmath17mo , @xmath18ru , @xmath14pd , @xmath19cd , @xmath10te , @xmath11te , @xmath12xe , @xmath13xe , for which the strength distribution for single @xmath1 emission , the m@xmath6 and half lives values for the double beta decay process , are presented .",
    "also , the strength distribution for the @xmath2 decay of the corresponding daughter nuclei is presented as function of the pnqrpa energy . a short summary and concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "@xcite , one of us , ( a.a.r . ) , introduced an angular momentum projected single particle basis which seems to be appropriate for the description of the single particle motion in a deformed mean field generated by the particle - core interaction . this single particle basis has been used to study the collective m1 states in deformed nuclei @xcite as well as the rate of double beta process @xcite .",
    "recently , a new version has been proposed where the deformation dependence of single particle energies is nonlinear and therefore more realistic @xcite .",
    "the new single particle basis has been used to study the double beta decay of deformed nuclei @xcite . in order to fix the necessary notations and moreover for the sake of a self - contained presentation",
    ", we describe briefly the main ideas underlying the construction of the projected single particle basis .    the single particle mean field is determined by a particle - core hamiltonian : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the spherical shell model hamiltonian , while @xmath23 is a harmonic quadrupole boson ( @xmath24 ) hamiltonian , associated to a phenomenological core .",
    "the interaction of the two subsystems is accounted for by the third term of the above equation , written in terms of the shape coordinates @xmath25 .",
    "the quadrupole shape coordinates are related to the quadrupole boson operators by the canonical transformation : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an arbitrary c number .",
    "the monopole shape coordinate is to be determined from the volume conservation condition .",
    "averaging @xmath28 on a given eigenstate of @xmath22 , denoted as usual by @xmath29 , one obtains a deformed quadrupole boson hamiltonian whose eigenstate is an axially symmetric coherent state : @xmath30|0\\rangle_b , \\label{psig}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 standing for the vacuum state of the boson operators and @xmath32 a real parameter which simulates the nuclear deformation . on the other hand ,",
    "averaging @xmath28 on @xmath33 one obtains a single particle mean field operator for the single particle motion , similar to the nilsson hamiltonian . concluding , by averaging on a factor state of the particle core space the rotational symmetry is broken and the mean field mentioned above",
    "may generate , by diagonalization , a deformed basis for treating the many body interacting systems . however , this standard procedure is tedious since the final many body states should be projected over angular momentum .",
    "our procedure defines first a spherical basis for the particle - core system , by projecting out the angular momentum from the deformed state @xmath34 the upper index appearing in the l.h .",
    "side of the above equation suggests that the product function is associated to the particle - core system .",
    "the projected states are obtained , in the usual manner , by acting on these deformed states with the projection operator @xmath35 we consider the subset of projected states : @xmath36\\equiv { \\cal n}_{nlj}^i\\psi_{nlj}^{im}(d ) .",
    "\\label{phiim}\\ ] ] which are orthonormalized and form a basis for the particle - core system .",
    "the main properties of these projected spherical states are :    \\a ) they are orthogonal with respect to i and m quantum numbers .",
    "\\b ) although the projected states are associated to the particle - core system , they can be used as a single particle basis .",
    "indeed , when a matrix element of a particle like operator is calculated , the integration on the core collective coordinates is performed first , which results in obtaining a final factorized expression : one factor carries the dependence on deformation and one is a spherical shell model matrix element .",
    "thus , the role of the core component is to induce a quadrupole deformation for the matrix elements of the operators acting on particle degrees of freedom .",
    "\\c ) the connection between the nuclear deformation and the parameter @xmath32 entering the definition of the coherent state ( [ psig ] ) can be obtained by requiring that the strength of the particle - core quadrupole - quadrupole interaction be identical to the nilsson deformed term of the mean field .    to the projected spherical states ,",
    "one associates the deformed single particle energies defined as average values of the particle - core hamiltonian @xmath37 . @xmath38    since the core contribution to this average value , does not depend on the quantum numbers of the single particle energy levels , it produces a constant shift for all energies . for this reason such a term",
    "is omitted in ( [ epsi ] ) . however ,",
    "when the ground state energy variation against deformation is studied , this term must be included .    in ref.@xcite",
    "it was shown that single particle energies , defined above , exhibit a nonlinear dependence on the deformation parameter @xmath32 .",
    "such a dependence is determined by the monopole - monopole interaction term after implementing the volume conservation constraint .",
    "moreover , the deformation dependence of the new single particle energies is similar to that shown by the nilsson model @xcite .",
    "therefore , the average values @xmath39 may be viewed as approximate expressions for the single particle energies in deformed nilsson orbits @xcite .",
    "we may account for the deviations from the exact eigenvalues by considering , at a later stage when a specific treatment of the many body system is performed , the exact matrix elements of the two body interaction .",
    "although the energy levels are similar to those of the nilsson model , the quantum numbers in the two schemes are different .",
    "indeed , here we generate from each j a multiplet of @xmath40 states distinguished by the quantum number @xmath41 , which plays the role of the nilsson quantum number @xmath42 and runs from 1/2 to @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , the energies corresponding to the quantum numbers @xmath44 and @xmath45 are equal to each other . on the other hand , for a given @xmath41 there are @xmath46 degenerate sub - states while the nilsson states are only double degenerate . as explained in ref.@xcite , the redundancy problem can be solved by changing the normalization of the model functions : @xmath47 due to this weighting factor the particle density function is providing the consistency result that the number of particles which can be distributed on the ( 2i+1 ) sub - states is at most 2 , which agrees with the nilsson model . here",
    "@xmath48 stands for the set of shell model quantum numbers @xmath49 . due to this normalization , the states @xmath50",
    "used to calculate the matrix elements of a given operator should be multiplied with the weighting factor @xmath51 .",
    "concluding , the projected single particle basis is defined by eq .",
    "( [ phiim ] ) .",
    "although these states are associated to a particle - core system , they can be used as a single particle basis due to the properties mentioned above .",
    "the projected states might be thought of as eigenstates of an effective rotational invariant fermionic one - body hamiltonian @xmath52 , with the corresponding energies given by eq.([epsi ] ) .",
    "@xmath53 this definition should be supplemented by the request that the matrix elements of any operator between states @xmath50 and @xmath54 have , as we mentioned above , a factorized form , one factor carrying the @xmath32 dependence , while the second one being a spherical shell model matrix element . due to these features",
    ", these states can be used as single particle basis to treat many body hamiltonians which involve one - body operators .",
    "this is the case of hamiltonians with two body separable forces . as a matter of fact",
    ", such a type of hamiltonian is used in the present paper .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite in the vibrational limit , @xmath55 , the projected spherical basis goes to the spherical shell model basis and @xmath39 to the eigenvalues of @xmath22 .    a fundamental result obtained in ref.@xcite for the product of two single particle states , which comprises a product of two core components , deserves to be mentioned .",
    "therein we have proved that the matrix elements of a two body interaction corresponding to the present scheme are very close to the matrix elements corresponding to spherical states projected from a deformed product state with one factor as a product of two spherical single particle states , and a second factor consisting of a common collective core wave function .",
    "the small discrepancies of the two types of matrix elements could be washed out by using slightly different strengths for the two body interaction in the two methods . due to this property",
    "the basis ( 2.6 ) might be used for studying any two - body interaction .      in the present work we aim at describing the gamow - teller two neutrino double beta decay processes with the property that mother and daughter nuclei may exhibit different shapes .",
    "indeed , in the chosen cases they might be both spherical , both deformed but with different deformations or one spherical and the other one of a deformed shape .",
    "the specific feature of the formalism used in the present work consists in treating all cases in an unified manner by using a sole single particle basis .",
    "the main ingredients of our formalism are as follows .",
    "the fermi transitions contributing about 20% and the `` forbidden '' transitions are ignored , which is a reasonable approximation for the two neutrino double beta decay in medium and heavy nuclei . as usual , the @xmath0 process is conceived as two successive single @xmath1 transitions . the first transition connects the ground state of the mother nucleus to a magnetic dipole state @xmath56 of the intermediate odd - odd nucleus which subsequently decays to the ground state of the daughter nucleus .",
    "the states mentioned above , involved in the @xmath0 process , are described in the framework of the pnqrpa formalism , by using the following many body hamiltonian :    @xmath57    the operator @xmath58 creates ( annihilates ) a particle of type @xmath59 ( = p , n ) in the state @xmath50 , when acting on the vacuum state @xmath60 . in order to simplify the notations , hereafter the set of quantum numbers",
    "@xmath61 will be omitted .",
    "the two body interaction consists of three terms , the pairing , the dipole - dipole particle - hole ( @xmath4 ) and the particle - particle ( @xmath5 ) interactions .",
    "the corresponding strengths are denoted by @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "all of them are separable interactions , with the factors defined by the following expressions :    @xmath63    the remaining operators from eq.([has ] ) can be obtained from the above defined operators , by hermitian conjugation .",
    "the one body term and the pairing interaction terms are treated first through the standard bcs formalism and consequently replaced by the quasiparticle one body term @xmath64 . in terms of quasiparticle creation ( @xmath65 ) and annihilation ( @xmath66 ) operators , related to the particle operators by means of the bogoliubov - valatin transformation , the two body interaction terms , involved in the model hamiltonian , can be expressed just by replacing the operators ( [ psibeta ] ) by their quasiparticle images which at their turn can be expressed as linear combination of dipole two quasiparticle and quasiparticle density operators defined as :    @xmath67_{1\\mu}. \\label{a1b1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the quasiparticle hamiltonian is further treated within the pnqrpa formalism , i.e. one determines the operator @xmath68 , \\label{gama}\\ ] ]    which satisfies the restrictions :    @xmath69=\\delta_{\\mu,\\mu'},\\;\\ ; [ h_{qp},\\gamma^{\\dagger}_{1\\mu}]=\\omega\\gamma^{\\dagger}_{1\\mu}. \\label{boscom}\\ ] ]    these operator equations yield a set of algebraic equations for the x ( usually called forward going ) and y ( named back - going ) amplitudes :    @xmath70    @xmath71=1 . \\label{rpaec}\\ ] ]    the analytical expressions for the pnqrpa matrices @xmath72 and @xmath73 are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "since the @xmath5 interaction has an attractive character , for a critical value of @xmath74 the lowest root of the pnqrpa equations may become imaginary .",
    "suppose that @xmath74 is smaller than its critical value and therefore all rpa solutions ( i.e. @xmath75 ) are real numbers and ordered as : @xmath76 here @xmath77 stands for the total number of the proton - neutron pair states whose angular momenta can couple to @xmath56 and moreover their quantum numbers @xmath78 are the same .",
    "hereafter the phonon amplitudes @xmath79 and @xmath80 will be accompanied by a lower index `` @xmath81 '' suggesting that they correspond to the energy @xmath82 .    since our single particle basis states depend on the deformation parameter @xmath32 , so do the pnqrpa energies and amplitudes .",
    "the pnqrpa ground state ( the vacuum state of the pnqrpa phonon operator ) describes an even - even system which might be either the mother or the daughter nucleus . in the two cases the gauge and nuclear deformation properties are different which results in determining distinct pnqrpa phonon operators acting on different vacua describing the mother and daughter ground states , respectively .",
    "therefore , one needs an additional index distinguishing the phonon operators of the mother and daughter nuclei .",
    "the single phonon states are defined by the equations : @xmath83 here the indices @xmath81 and @xmath84 stand for initial ( mother ) and final ( daughter ) nuclei , respectively .",
    "this equation defines two sets of non - orthogonal states , @xmath85 and @xmath86 describing the neighboring odd - odd nucleus .",
    "the states of the first set may be fed by a beta minus decay of the ground state of the mother nucleus while the states of the second set are populated with a beta plus transition operator from the ground state of the daughter nucleus .",
    "if the energy carried by leptons in the intermediate state is approximated by the sum of the rest energy of the emitted electron and half the q - value of the double beta decay process @xmath87 the reciprocal value of the @xmath0 half life can be factorized as : @xmath88 where f is an integral on the phase space , independent of the nuclear structure , while m@xmath6 stands for the gamow - teller transition amplitude and has the expression :    @xmath89    in the above equation , the denominator consists of three terms : a ) @xmath90 , which was already defined , b ) the average value of the k - th pnqrpa energy normalized to the particular value corresponding to k=1 , i.e.    @xmath91    and c ) the experimental energy for the lowest @xmath56 state .",
    "the indices carried by the transition operators indicate that they act in the space spanned by the pnqrpa states associated to the initial",

    "we would like to say a few words about what is specific to our formalism .",
    "since our single particle states are projected spherical states , the pnqrpa formalism is fully identical to the one , usually employed for spherical nuclei . since in the vibrational limit , ( @xmath55 )",
    ", our basis goes to the spherical shell model basis , one may say that the present formalism provides a unified description of spherical and deformed nuclei .",
    "the formalism described in the previous section , has been applied to the following ten isotopes : @xmath8ca , @xmath16zr , @xmath17mo , @xmath18ru , @xmath14pd , @xmath19cd , @xmath10te , @xmath11te , @xmath12xe , @xmath13xe .",
    "the spherical shell model parameters for these double beta emitters and the corresponding daughter nuclei are given by : @xmath93 with the strength parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 having the same ( z , n ) dependence as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the angular momentum projected basis depends on two additional parameters .",
    "these are the deformation parameter @xmath32 and the factor @xmath27 entering the canonical transformation relating the quadrupole coordinate and boson operators .",
    "they are fixed in the same manner as in our previous publication @xcite .",
    "indeed , we require that the relative energy for the states @xmath96 and @xmath97 be equal to that of nilsson levels with @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the @xmath100 major shell .",
    "moreover , adding to the mean field term defined before a @xmath101 two body interaction we require that the lowest root for the charge conserving qrpa equation be equal to the experimental energy of the lowest @xmath102 state in the mother nucleus . throughout this paper , the m - degenerate states @xmath103 are denoted by @xmath104 .",
    "the bcs calculation has been performed within a restricted single particle space . due to the level crossing",
    ", the restriction of the single particle space for deformed nuclei is different from that for spherical nuclei . indeed , in spherical nuclei ikeda sum rule ( isr ) is satisfied if two major shells plus the spin orbit partner of the intruder state are included in the single particle space .",
    "suppose that the neutron open shell has n=3 with the intruder state @xmath105 , in the standard spherical shell model picture .",
    "in the present formalism , including the spin - orbit partner state @xmath106 means to consider the states @xmath107 with @xmath108 .",
    "however , some of these states are higher in energy than states belonging to the @xmath109 multiplet . due to such features appearing both in the upper part of the major open shell of neutrons and the bottom side of the proton major open shell we truncated the space considering an inert ( z , n ) core and a number of states lying above the core states .",
    "the core and the number of outside states are chosen such that the non - occupation probabilities for the neglected bottom states as well as the occupation probabilities for the ignored upper states are smaller than 0.01 .",
    "of course , the single particle space for protons and neutrons are the same .",
    "our calculations were performed with the core and number of states given in table i. once the single particle space is defined , the number of the dipole proton - neutron states can be calculated .",
    "furthermore , the dimensions of the pnqrpa matrices for mother ( @xmath110 ) and daughter ( @xmath111 ) nuclei are readily obtained .",
    "these dimensions are also given in table i. it is worth mentioning that using the single particle spaces given in table i , ikeda sum rule is satisfied for both the mother and daughter nuclei considered in the present paper .    .",
    "the number of single particle proton states lying above the ( z , n ) core is given .",
    "the single particle space for neutrons is identical to that for protons . @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the dimensions of the pnqrpa matrix for mother and daughter nuclei , respectively [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     before closing this section we would like to say a few more words about the adopted procedure for fixing the dipole proton - neutron strength parameters . for the sake of a unitary treatment , the half lives of all double beta decaying nuclei were calculated by taking for @xmath112 the value 1.254 .",
    "however , in five of the situations considered the single beta properties for the intermediate odd - odd nuclei are determined by supposing an effective value ( @xmath112=1 . ) for the axial - vector coupling strength , which might simulate the contribution of the higher energy states .",
    "thus , although the nuclear matrix elements as well as the proton - neutron interaction strengths are similar for double and single transitions , we considered that the two sets of properties mentioned above are influenced by different parts of the proton - neutron qrpa excitation spectrum . in this context",
    "it is worth mentioning that some time ago abad @xmath113 @xcite advanced the single state dominance hypothesis ( ssdh ) which asserts that for double beta decay processes where the intermediate odd - odd nucleus has the state @xmath56 as ground state , most of the contribution to the double beta matrix element comes from the the first intermediate dipole state .",
    "if that hypothesis works , then the double beta process is dominated by two virtual and succesive single @xmath1 transitions , one from the ground state of the mother nucleus to the ground state of the intermediate odd - odd nucleus , while the other one from there to the ground state of the daughter nucleus . in the meantime",
    "the ssdh has been considered by many authors @xcite . as shown in table",
    "x , four odd - odd isotopes have indeed the first @xmath56 as ground state .",
    "moreover , there are also available data for @xmath1 and @xmath114 transitions of @xmath11i . therefore , for all five isotopes from table ii we checked the ssdh validity by keeping in eq .",
    "( 2.21 ) only the first term from the sum and considering the states overlap equal to unity .",
    "also the @xmath115 values are calculated by considering @xmath116 the results are compared with those obtained by summing up over all pnqrpa states , otherwise keeping @xmath117 in order to have a fair comparison .",
    "results are listed in table xi . from there one may conclude that indeed our calculations confirm the ssdh for @xmath17mo , @xmath18ru and @xmath14pd , but not for the remaining two double beta nuclei , @xmath19cd and @xmath10te .",
    "most likely for these cases the summation in the expression of @xmath118 should be extended from one to few states .",
    "it is worthwhile to address the question how stable are these results against changing the dimension of the single particle basis .",
    "we checked this feature with a positive result . to be more concrete",
    "let us describe the modifications obtained for @xmath14pd .",
    "for this isotope we increased the dimension @xmath110 from 23 to 27 , otherwise keeping the same parameters for single particle states as before .",
    "we changed the pairing strengths in order to preserve the pairing properties , i.e. to have the gap parameters unchanged .",
    "the new @xmath119 for mother and daughter are ( 0.281,0.271)mev and ( 0.2795 , 0.1665)mev , respectively .",
    "the pnqrpa matrix has the dimension @xmath120 the isr value devates from @xmath121 by 3% .",
    "the proton - neutron interaction strengths have been changed to ( @xmath122mev in order to keep the @xmath123 values for the single beta transitions of @xmath14ag close to the experimental data .",
    "the results for these observables are 4.84 for @xmath1 and 3.70 for @xmath114 . the double beta transition amplitude and the @xmath124 obtained under the new circumstances , are 0.2626 and 15.881@xmath125 .",
    "one notes that these values are very close to those listed in table iv .",
    "one may conclude that the results are stable against enlarging the single particle space and moreover our choice for @xmath110 is motivated by the fact that isr is satisfied .",
    "in the previous sections we completed the project started in ref.@xcite by studying the @xmath0 decay of another ten even - even nuclei exhibiting various shapes . in the chosen cases",
    "the mother and daughter nuclei have the following shapes : a ) both are spherical , b ) both deformed - prolate , c ) both deformed - oblate , d ) one spherical and another deformed - prolate , e ) both are near spherical but prolate , f ) both are near spherical but oblate .",
    "the deformations obtained for the ten isotopes are similar to those of ref.@xcite . in some cases these are different from nuclear deformations reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "indeed , for example in the present paper as well as in ref.@xcite , the quadrupole deformation for @xmath17mo is negative while in ref.@xcite this is positive .",
    "moreover , as shown in ref.@xcite a negative deformation is reached in @xmath126mo .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy might be the fact that there the stationary points of the energy function are obtained in the space of quadrupole and hexadecapole deformations while here only the quadrupole variable is considered .",
    "moreover , here an angular momentum projected single particle basis is used .",
    "it is manifest the fact that an oblate to oblate single beta transition is involving single particle configurations which are different from those appearing in a prolate to prolate transition . indeed , suppose that a certain number of nucleons are distributed alternatively in a prolate and an oblate single particle levels and that in the first case the fermi level for neutrons is characterized by a small quantum number @xmath41 . in this case",
    "the @xmath1 strength for the prolate to prolate transition is carried by single particle dipole transitions between states of low @xmath41 as well as of large @xmath41 but originating from the upper shell . by contrary , in the oblate to oblate transitions , the privileged transitions are those relating neutron and proton single particle states with large @xmath41 and those of small @xmath41 from the upper shell .",
    "such cases can be easily identified in tables vi and viii . due to the feature mentioned above the strength fragmentation",
    "is expected to be more pronounced in the oblate to oblate transitions .",
    "actually such a situation is met for @xmath17mo , @xmath18ru , @xmath14pd and @xmath19cd .",
    "the structure of the peaks seen in figs 1,2 in the @xmath1 strength distribution of the nuclei mentioned before is as follows . in @xmath17mo",
    "the peaks are determined by transitions inside the shells 1 g ( 1st peak ) 2d ( 2nd peak ) and 1 g and 1f ( 3rd peak ) .",
    "for @xmath18ru the first two peaks are determined mainly by the transitions from the shell 1 g while the third one by the transition from the shell 1f . in @xmath14pd",
    "the following shells are involved in the transitions contributing most to the three peaks : 1 g ( 1st peak ) , 1 g , 2d ( 2nd peak ) and 1 g , 1f ( 3rd peak ) . for @xmath19cd",
    "only one shell contributes most to any of the three dominant peaks : 1 g ( 1st and 2nd peaks ) , 1f ( 3rd peak ) .",
    "note that for te and xe isotopes , the @xmath1 strength is mainly concentrated in one pnqrpa state .",
    "these nuclei are almost spherical ( te isotopes are soft prolate while xe isotopes are soft oblate ) .",
    "moreover , in the daughter nuclei the nuclear deformation has the same sign as in the corresponding mother nuclei . in @xmath10te and @xmath11te the dominant single particle state",
    "@xmath127 transitions are @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively . in xe isotopes",
    "the @xmath127 single particle transition @xmath130 , prevails .",
    "the transition amplitudes @xmath118 and half lives for the @xmath0 process were calculated within the pnqrpa approach by using a projected spherical basis .",
    "the agreement with the available data is quite good .",
    "the adopted fitting procedure for the @xmath131 dipole interaction strengths yield large values for @xmath132 , in several cases .",
    "these values are not far from the critical value , where the pnqrpa breaks down .",
    "it is an open question whether for these transitions a good agreement with the data would be possible by keeping a small @xmath132 , but accounting for higher pnqrpa effects .",
    "inspecting the table iv , one can judge not only on the agreement of the present results with the experimental data but also on the comparison between predictions of different theoretical approaches .",
    "indeed , the agreement with experimental data is reasonably good .",
    "although they are based on different formalisms as well as different single particle states the present results and those of suhonen _",
    "et al._@xcite are not far from each other .",
    "comparing the results of the present paper , obtained with @xmath133 and @xmath132 given by eq.([chi ] ) and the corresponding predictions from refs.@xcite , one notices that they are quite different .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for @xmath18ru and @xmath14pd the @xmath131 dipole interactions are fully determined by fitting the data concerning the @xmath114 and @xmath1 decay @xmath123 values of the ground state ( @xmath56 ) of the intermediate nuclei @xmath18rh and @xmath14ag , respectively .",
    "the predictions for the double beta emitter half lives are @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "they are 40 and 8 times smaller than the corresponding predictions of ref.@xcite .",
    "our prediction for the half - life of @xmath12xe , against double beta decay , is @xmath136 which exceeds by a factor 15 the corresponding finding of ref.@xcite .",
    "finally we may conclude that the projected spherical single particle basis provides a suitable framework for a unified description of the double beta properties of spherical and deformed nuclei .",
    "the results presented in the previous publication @xcite and here constitute a good starting point for studying the higher pnqrpa contributions to the @xmath0 process as well as the transitions populating the daughter nuclei in an excited state .",
