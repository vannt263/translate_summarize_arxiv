    "the problem of defining and computing volumes for manifolds with singular metrics @xmath1 has played a central role in the anti de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence as well as in conformal geometry  @xcite .",
    "volumes of regions approaching the hypersurface / boundary  @xmath2 diverge at @xmath3 .",
    "however , by a suitable cut - off and renormalization , a renormalized volume functional can be defined that is invariant under conformal transformations of the boundary metric @xmath4 up to a ( conformally invariant ) anomaly .",
    "an early and spectacular ads / cft success was the work of henningson and skenderis that identified this as the weyl or trace anomaly of the boundary quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "significant mathematical progress was made when fefferman and graham  @xcite showed that for poincar ",
    "einstein structures ( euclidean signature , asymptotically ads , einstein manifolds ) , the renormalized volume anomaly recovered branson s  @xmath0-curvature  @xcite for the boundary manifold .",
    "this is an important invariant of conformal geometries  ( see  @xcite and the reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "the renormalized volume is usually obtained by computing a fefferman ",
    "graham coordinate expansion of a bulk metric tensor solving , to some order , a bulk problem with boundary data at a conformal infinity  @xmath2 .",
    "this expansion is inserted first in the metric determinant and , in turn , into a regulated volume integral .",
    "we shall present a general , simplifying and efficient approach to volume computations for singular metrics that , in contrast to previous studies , does not rely on solving any particular bulk problem .",
    "let @xmath5 be a riemannian manifold whose metric @xmath6 is singular along an hypersurface @xmath2 . for simplicity",
    "we take all structures to be oriented .",
    "given a compact region  @xmath7 such that @xmath8 , we define the regulated volume of @xmath7 as follows ( see also the diagram in display  ( [ iamnotclosed ] ) ) .",
    "[ def1 ] given @xmath9 as above , let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be a smooth , one parameter family of oriented hypersurfaces such that    a.   @xmath12 , b.   @xmath13 , and c.   @xmath14 separates @xmath7 into a disjoint union @xmath15 , where @xmath6 is non - singular in @xmath16 .",
    "then the _ regulated volume _ of @xmath7 is defined to be @xmath17    our methods can in principle be applied to quite general metric singularities , but we focus on the mathematically and physically central conformally compact case for which the hypersurface @xmath2 is a conformal infinity for the metric @xmath6 . in this case",
    "the regulated volume may be expanded as a sum of divergences ( poles in @xmath18 ) , an anomaly ( a @xmath19 term ) and the  @xmath18-independent renormalized volume plus @xmath20 contributions .",
    "we give simple results for the divergences and anomaly in terms of integrals over dirac - delta distributions , and their derivatives , depending on a defining function for the hypersurface .",
    "these results encode the precise dependence of the divergences on the choice of regulator  @xmath11 , while the anomaly is independent of the regulator and is conformally invariant ( in a suitable sense ) .    for applications , results for the anomaly and divergences given as hypersurface integrals over local quantities",
    "are required .",
    "here it is propitious to assume that the hypersurface @xmath21 is closed .",
    "we also indicate how to handle non - closed boundaries in the current work , but reserve a detailed treatment to a sequel article .",
    "the key tool for both cases is the boundary calculus for conformally compact manifolds developed in  @xcite . for conformally compact structures , we present exact and explicit formulas for both the divergences and the anomaly in the regulated volume .",
    "these are expressed as boundary integrals over local quantities and hold for _ any _ regulator and _ any _ conformally compact manifold .",
    "our results can be applied to study the conformal geometry of hypersurface embeddings .",
    "quantities that depend only on the conformal embedding of the hypersurface  @xmath2 , can be found and studied by requiring that the metric @xmath6 solves a singular version of the yamabe problem of finding conformally rescaled metrics with constant scalar curvature  @xcite .",
    "in fact , since a unique asymptotic solution to the singular yamabe problem exists ( at least up to the order required for the anomaly ) for any conformally compact stucture , there is a corresponding canonical result for the anomaly which is given by an integral over a density that can be defined for any hypersurface in a riemannian manifold ; this gives a new @xmath0-curvature that includes extrinsic curvature data .",
    "in particular , by construction , it only depends on the conformal data of how the hypersurface  @xmath2 is embedded in the bulk .",
    "since we need not impose the bulk einstein equation , our results apply to general bulk / boundary problems and thus extend an important aspect of the ads / cft program .",
    "a second motivation for our study is that this general setting allows us to study the extrinsic conformal geometry of the boundary geometry .",
    "mathematically , our results are part of a general program to understand conformal hypersurface geometry  @xcite ( see  @xcite for an overview ) , and to develop the calculus for integrated conformal hypersurface invariants begun in  @xcite . indeed , we wish to initiate a new approach to geometric invariant theory based on holographic renormalization .",
    "this program is also of substantial physical interest : soon after the original ads / cft duality was proposed , graham and witten showed how the renormalized volume method could be extended to bulk minimal surfaces in order to analyze holographic observables for boundary submanifolds  @xcite .",
    "this study produced conformal hypersurface invariants , the most notable of which , perhaps , is the willmore energy for surfaces embedded in 3-manifolds .",
    "more recently , classes of these observables have been related to entanglement entropies of boundary field theories  @xcite .",
    "a key observation underlying our approach is that the metric in equation  ( [ ds2 ] ) is determined by the pair @xmath22 where @xmath23 are a non - singular bulk metric and function .",
    "however , we equally well could have chosen the pair @xmath24 where @xmath25 is any smooth , positive function of the bulk manifold .",
    "the equivalence @xmath26 defines a conformal class of metrics @xmath27=[{{\\hspace{.3mm}}}\\omega^2g{{\\hspace{.3mm}}}]$ ] and suggests that conformal , rather than riemannian , geometry is the correct tool for simultaneously handling bulk and boundary geometries in an ads / cft setting .",

    "when the function  @xmath30 has a suitable non - empty , nowhere dense zero locus , the data  @xmath31 is called an _ almost riemannian geometry _  @xcite ( note that the canonical equivalence class representative @xmath32 $ ] defines a singular riemannian metric  @xmath33 as in equation  ( [ ds2 ] ) ) .",
    "when this zero locus  @xmath2 is a hypersurface or boundary component and the function  @xmath30 is for it a defining function , then  @xmath2 is a _",
    "conformal infinity _ for the singular metric @xmath34 .",
    "when @xmath35 is compact with boundary the zero locus of @xmath30 , then @xmath31 is said to be conformally compact .",
    "in fact , for our purposes , it suffices to work in a collar neighborhood of the boundary , therefore we shall say that @xmath31 is _ conformally compact _ in any case where @xmath2 is closed .",
    "reformulating the renormalized volume problem in terms of almost riemannian geometry brings to bear a potent boundary calculus of conformally compact manifolds that utilizes the bulk conformal structure  @xcite .",
    "one of our main results is that for _ any _ conformally compact manifold , the anomaly is given as an integral over the corresponding extrinsically coupled @xmath0-curvature first introduced in  @xcite . when regulating a quantum field theory , a dimensionful scale must be introduced .",
    "a powerful way to handle dimensionful quantities is to use conformal densities .",
    "physically , a dimensionful quantity , such as a length , will vary across spacetime if different choices of local unit systems are employed .",
    "for example , the invariant property of a length is its linear homogeneity under weyl transformations .",
    "hence to regulate renormalized volumes we introduce a nowhere vanishing , unit weight , bulk conformal density @xmath36 and cut off the bulk geometry at a regulating surface @xmath11 determined by @xmath37 the renormalized volume anomaly is then given , in @xmath38 bulk dimensions , by a boundary / hypersurface integral @xmath39 where @xmath40 $ ] is an _ extrinsically coupled @xmath0-curvature _ of  @xmath2 which generalizes the standard branson  @xmath0-curvature .",

    "the quantity @xmath52 is a total divergence along  @xmath2 , and hence the @xmath0-curvature integrates to an invariant of the ( closed ) boundary conformal manifold .",
    "* the anomaly is in general non - vanishing .",
    "however , when the bulk geometry is einstein , the extrinsic @xmath0-curvature vanishes for odd dimensional @xmath2 , while for even dimensional  @xmath2 it reduces to the standard @xmath0-curvature of the boundary conformal geometry .",

    "is achieved by expressing these as local bulk quantities restricted to the hypersurface .",

    "as already mentioned , there exist also extremely simple distributional formul   for these quantities valid both for general singular metrics and for non - closed  @xmath2 ; see theorem  [ distdivsan ] . for conformally compact structures the local boundary",
    "integral expressions for these are given in proposition  [ divs ] and theorem  [ anomalytheorem ] .",
    "variational problems for @xmath0-curvatures are also a subject of intense study . in particular , the metric variation of the branson @xmath0 curvature",
    "yields the fefferman  graham obstruction tensor  @xcite .",
    "this latter quantity determines whether log terms must be introduced when solving einstein s equations in a fefferman  graham expansion off a conformal infinity .",
    "for the extrinsically coupled @xmath0-curvature , an analogous problem is to treat variations of the anomaly  @xmath57 with respect to variations of the embedding of the hypersurface  @xmath2 . in  @xcite ,",
    "an efficient calculus for this type of variation was developed by writing boundary energy functionals holographically in terms of bulk integrals .",
    "this is also a key part of our extrinsic @xmath0-curvature computation . indeed",
    "the hypersurface variation of the anomaly plays the role of an obstruction to smoothly solving a bulk problem , but rather than einstein s equations , the relevant problem is the singular yamabe problem .",
    "this problem was found to be obstructed in  @xcite , with the obstruction shown to be a non - trivial conformal invariant of embedded surfaces when  @xmath56 .",
    "generally , the obstruction was shown to give a natural conformal hypersurface invariant and called the obstruction density in  @xcite .",
    "low dimensional examples are known to be variational  @xcite .",
    "very recently , graham has proved that the obstruction density of  @xcite is the variation of the renormalized volume anomaly  @xcite . in section  4",
    "we rederive this result within our framework .",
    "our results can be applied to the situation encountered in entanglement entropy studies where the relevant renormalized volume computation applies to the renormalized `` area '' of a minimal hypersurface in a ( spatial ) bulk geometry whose boundary is some ( codimension two with respect to the spatial bulk geometry ) closed hypersurface separating entangled spatial regions in a boundary quantum field theory . for that , one only needs to compute the induced metric along the minimal hypersurface and then treat the entangling hypersurface as the boundary for the minimal hypersurface .",
    "the laplace  robin operator characterization of volume divergences is extremely simple , but naturally will produce complicated formul   in terms of both intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures when higher divergences in higher dimensions are considered .",
    "however , since quantum corrections to holographic entanglement entropies are of current topical interest ( see for example  @xcite ) , we have converted our compact laplace ",
