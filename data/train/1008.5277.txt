    "the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry is one of the most striking mysteries in the universe .",
    "the five - year observations of the wmap colloboration precisely measured the ratio of baryon number to photon number densities as @xcite @xmath2 according to sakharov s suggestion @xcite , to dynamically generate the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe , three conditions must be satisfied , which are the violation of baryon number conservation , the violation of c and cp , and the deviation from thermal equilibrium . in the standard model ( sm ) , c parity is maximally violated and",
    "the phase of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is the sole source of the cp violation .",
    "however , this cp violation effect , which has been precisely measured in hadronic physics , is too small to be used to accommodate the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "such that , investigating the new origin of cp violation is a subject with great significance .",
    "more recently , the d0 collaboration @xcite , with @xmath3 of data , has reported a measurement of the like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry in semi - leptonic decay of @xmath4 hadrons , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of events with @xmath7 hadrons decaying semileptonically into @xmath8 .",
    "this result , with the first error being statistical and the second systematic , is @xmath0 deviation from the sm prediction of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 was also measured by the cdf collaboration @xcite , which has @xmath11 , using @xmath12 of data .",
    "this result is positive but still compatible with the d0 measurement at @xmath13 level because its uncertainties are 4 times larger than those of d0 . combining in quadrature these two results , one has @xmath14 @xcite which is still @xmath15 away from the sm value .",
    "if confirmed , it will be an evidence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "there have already been some models @xcite attempting to explain the data .",
    "the d0 collaboration s result is the first laboratory evidence for significant matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "we suspect there should be some connection between the baryon asymmetry of the universe and this anomaly . in this paper",
    ", we consider the possible extension of the sm with one color - triplet charged scalar and three majorana fermion singlets . in this model , there are tree level processes leading to dimension six effective operators , like @xmath16 , which may contribute to @xmath17 mixing and thus the like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry can be explained . besides",
    ", the out of equilibrium decay of the neutral fermion may produce @xmath18 asymmetry .",
    "this asymmetry may be converted to the baryon asymmetry of the universe via sphaleron process @xcite , which violates @xmath19 but keeps @xmath18 conservation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present our model .",
    "section iii is devoted to investigating the like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry .",
    "we study baryogenesis in section iv .",
    "conclusions and remarks are presented in section v.",
    "to reproduce the large anomalous like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry observed by d0 and to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe , new physics beyond the sm is needed . in this section ,",
    "we consider the possible extension of the sm with one charged scalar @xmath20 and three fermion singlets @xmath21 , whose representation in @xmath22 gauge group are @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 , respectively . for simplification , @xmath27 discrete flavor symmetry",
    "is introduced and the presentations of fields on @xmath27 are listed in table i. the newly introduced lagrangian can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are yukawa coupling matrices , @xmath31 is the sm higgs boson , @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent the second or third generation right - handed up- and down - type quarks .",
    "assuming @xmath20 has baryon number @xmath34 , the interaction , @xmath35 , violates baryon number by @xmath36 unit .",
    ".representations of fields on @xmath27 flavor symmetry . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that @xmath27 symmetry is explicitly broken down by the yukawa interactions containing the firt generation right - handed quarks and the mass term of @xmath21",
    ". we may introduce another higgs doublet , whose representation under @xmath27 is 1 , to genreate masses for the first generation up- or down - type quarks , and itroduce one higgs singlet , whose representation unde @xmath27 is @xmath37 , to generate masses for @xmath21 .",
    "such that @xmath27 symmetry can be recovered . due to the existence of @xmath27 symmetry , @xmath20 and @xmath21 do not couple to the first generation of quarks . as a result , we need not to warry about constraints from proton stability , @xmath38 mixing or @xmath39 mixing .",
    "notice that @xmath20 is similar to the super - partner of @xmath40 and @xmath41 is similar to @xmath42-parity violating interactions in supersymmetry .",
    "the experimental lower bound for the mass of @xmath20 should be consistent with that of squarks . integrating out heavy degrees of freedom , we can derive an effective operator that contributes to @xmath43 .",
    "the inclusive decay width for this process can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the contribution of sm penguin diagram and @xmath46 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comes from the new interaction in our model , with @xmath47 .",
    "assuming @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we get the predication for the branching ratio of @xmath50 : @xmath51 , which is consistent with its present experimental value , @xmath52 , predicted by the heavy flavor average group ( hfag ) @xcite .",
    "notice that , @xmath10 , appearing in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , is blind as to which flavors of @xmath54 meson produced the two muon , it places a constraint on the semi - leptonic cp asymmetries of both @xmath55 and @xmath56 mesons , which we will call @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 taking into account the current experimental value of @xmath61 @xcite , one obtains @xmath62 , which is in agreement with d0 s direct measurement of @xmath63 @xcite , albeit with large uncertainties .",
    "we may combine all these results to obtain an average value @xmath64 .",
    "theoretically , there are two amplitudes characterizing mixing in @xmath56 system : the off - diagonal element of the mass matrix @xmath65 and the off - diagonal element of the decay matrix @xmath66 .",
    "the violation of cp is caused by the non - zero value of the phase : @xmath67 . in terms of these parameters , to a very good approximation , @xmath68 is given by @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 agrees with data very well , while both @xmath72 and @xmath73 differ from the experimental data by about @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "it is natural to attribute d0 s result to big corrections to @xmath76 and @xmath73 from new physics .    in our model",
    ", there are tree level contributions to the dimension six effective operator @xmath77 , which contributes to @xmath78 for @xmath53 mixing . integrating out @xmath20 at the tree level , we have @xmath79 where @xmath80 are generation indices and @xmath81 are color indices . starting with these four quark interactions , one can derive the expression of @xmath82 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 is the bag parameter and we take it to be equal to one .",
    "there are also contributions to the off - diagonal elements , @xmath65 , of the mass matrix of the @xmath86 system due to the box diagram .",
    "using vacuum insertion approximation , we have @xmath87 { \\cal f}^ * ( x_\\alpha^ { } , x_\\beta^{})\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) . in deriving eq .",

    "let s assume that the yukawa coupling constant @xmath30 is real , and the operator @xmath101 dominates contributions to @xmath102 and @xmath103 . in this case , @xmath73 as well as @xmath58 will be functions of @xmath104 and @xmath94 .",
    "we plot in fig . 1 , @xmath58 as function of @xmath104 with @xmath94 being a random parameter in the range @xmath95~ ( { \\rm gev})$ ] .",
    "the horizontal line represents the central value of @xmath58 measured by @xmath96 .",
    "it is clear that , to fit the data , @xmath105 should be larger than @xmath106 .",
    "of course , @xmath107 can be much smaller in the case @xmath30 being complex .",
    "as noticed in the last section , the d0 s like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry can be explained by introducing a color - triplet scalar @xmath20 . as a byproduct , this may induce baryon number violating operators like @xmath108 , which is just what we need to reproduce the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "we assume @xmath21 is thermally produced in the early universe .",
    "its out of equilibrium decay , as shown in fig 2 , may violate the @xmath18 symmetry .",
    "the expression for the cp asymmetry @xmath109 in the decay of @xmath21 , which is similar to that in the decay of heavy majorana neutrinos in the type - i seesaw mechanism @xcite , can be written as @xmath110 \\over [ \\zeta \\zeta^\\dagger]_{11}^ { }   } f{\\left ( m_{\\chi_i}^2 \\over m_{\\chi_1}^2 \\right ) } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is given by @xmath112 \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after the evolution of boltzmann equations governing the baryon number density , we derive the @xmath18 asymmetry stored in right - handed quarks .",
    "because all the quarks are in thermal equilibrium , this asymmetry may be converted to left - handed quarks through the left - right equilibrium @xcite , which can be understood as follows .",
    "let us define the chemical potential associated with the @xmath113 field as @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the chemical potential contributing to @xmath18 asymmetry and @xmath116 is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "hence at equilibrium we have the chemical potential associated with @xmath117 given by @xmath118 .",
    "thus we see that the same chemical potential is associated with @xmath117 as that of @xmath113 .",
    "finally , the @xmath18 asymmetry is converted to the baryon asymmetry of the universe through the sphaleron process , which violates @xmath19 symmetry but keeps @xmath18 conservation .",
    "then the final baryon asymmetry can be given as @xcite @xmath119 with @xmath120 which measures the effectiveness of decays at the crucial epoch ( @xmath121 ) when @xmath21 must decrease in number if they are to stay in equilibrium .",
    "here , @xmath122 @xmath123 is the planck mass and @xmath124 is effective degrees of freedom , at the temperature where @xmath21 decouples . in deriving eq .",
    "( 16 ) , we have assumed that the factor @xmath125 is greater than 1 , but not too large . if @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",
    "for instance , inputting @xmath128 , k=50 , @xmath129 and maximal cp - phase , we derive the sample predication : @xmath130 . in consequence ,",
    "we deduce @xmath131 , as desired .",
    "we have extended the sm by introducing one color - triplet charged scalar , @xmath20 , and three majorana fermions , @xmath21 .",
    "we have shown that the dimuon charge asymmetry , reported by the d0 collaboration , can be explained by the yukawa interaction , like @xmath132 . besides",
    ", the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe can be realized by the out of equilibrium decays of @xmath21 .",
