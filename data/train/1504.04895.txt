    "x - ray binary pulsars ( xbps ) are systems consisting of magnetized neutron stars and mass - donating stellar companions . according to the type of the companion",
    ", they are classified into several subgroups , including super giant xbps and be xbps as major members ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since these neutron stars are strongly magnetized , the matter flows from the companion are dominated by the magnetic pressure inside the alfven radius , and are then funneled onto the magnetic poles along the magnetic field lines .",
    "since the accreting matter transfers its angular momentum at the alfven radius to the neutron star , the spin - up rate and the mass accretion rate ( i.e. the x - ray luminosity ) of an xbp are thought to be closely correlated ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the issue is relevant to the evolution scenario of xbps and their magnetic fields , and thus very important .",
    "although several observational results to examine the relation have been reported so far ( e.g. ) , the question is still unsettled because we need to select an object with a well - determined magnetic - field strength and large luminosity swings .",
    "furthermore , we need to disentangle intrinsic period changes from orbital doppler effects .",
    "gx 304@xmath01 is a be xbp discovered by x - ray balloon observations in 1967 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the source shows x - ray properties typical of be / x - ray binaries ; large flux variations ( @xcite ) , the @xmath6-s coherent pulsation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , a hard x - ray spectrum represented by a power - law with an absorption column density @xmath7 @xmath8 and a photon index @xmath92 up to 40 kev @xcite , and periodic flaring events , namely outbursts , separated by @xmath10 days presumably attributed to the binary orbital period @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart was identified with a be star @xcite , which is characterized by double - peak h@xmath11 emission , strong he@xmath12 and o@xmath12 absorptions @xcite , and photometric variability @xcite .",
    "based on these line features , @xcite suggested that the circumstellar disk is edge - on ( @xmath13 ) . from the visual extension ( @xmath14 mag . ) , the source distance is estimated to be @xmath15 kpc @xcite .",
    "however , the binary orbital elements have not been determined , yet .    since the last outburst was observed in the 1980s @xcite , the source had been in a quiescent state with no significant x - ray emission for 28 years .",
    "its long absence was broken by the hard x - ray detection with integral in 2008 june @xcite . since then , continuous x - ray monitoring with the maxi gsc and the swift bat has detected nine outbursts every @xmath10 d , from 2009 november to 2012 november @xcite . across these multiple outbursts , the 220 kev maxi gsc intensity varied nearly by two orders of magnitude .",
    "suzaku , rxte and integral observations , performed at a bright outburst phase , revealed a cyclotron resonance scattering feature ( crsf ) at around 54 kev @xcite .",
    "the estimated surface magnetic field , is almost the highest among those of xbps of which the crsf signature is significantly detected . in the 2010 august outburst ,",
    "the barycentric pulsation period was @xmath1275.37 - 275.46 s , which suggests that the pulsar was spun down by @xmath16 s during the 28 years of quiescence @xcite .",
    "the timing analysis of rxte data revealed the complex pulse - profile dependence on the energy band as well as the luminosity , and the quasi - periodic oscillation at @xmath17 hz @xcite .",
    "the period and pulsed flux have also been monitored by the fermi gbm pulsar project @xcite .",
    "all these data thus provide us with a valuable opportunity to study the relation between the luminosity and spin period of the xbp .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the x - ray outburst light curve of gx 304@xmath01 during the active period from 2009 to 2013 obtained with the maxi gsc , and the pulse period variations derived from the rxte / pca and fermi / gbm data .",
    "our goal is to separate the orbital doppler effects and the intrinsic pulse - period change .",
    "the observation and data reduction are described in section [ sec : observation ] , while the data analysis and results in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "we discuss the results in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "since the maxi ( monitor of all - sky x - ray image ; @xcite ) experiment onboard the iss ( international space station ) started its operation in 2009 august , the gsc ( gas slit camera ; @xcite ) , one of the two maxi detectors , has been scanning almost the whole sky every 92-minute orbital cycle in the 230 kev band .",
    "we utilized archived gsc light - curve data for gx 304@xmath01 in 24 kev , 410 kev and 1020 kev bands , which are processed with a standard procedure @xcite by the maxi team and available from the maxi web site .",
    "figure [ fig : gsclc ] top shows the 220 kev maxi / gsc light curve from 2009 august to 2013 december in 1-d time bin .",
    "it clearly reveals the recurrent outburst activity by a @xmath18 d interval , which is consistent with the @xmath19 d periodicity found in the 19711972 outbursts with vela 5b @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : gsclc ] covers 12 epochs of the outbursts , which we consecutively name a , b , c , ... , and l. the outburst i in 2012 august reached @xmath20 photons @xmath21 s@xmath22 ( @xmath23 crab ) in the 220 kev band , which is the highest among the flaring events that have ever been observed from this source .",
    "if the source distance of @xmath24 kpc , the energy spectrum of a cutoff power - law with a photon index @xmath25 and an e - fold energy @xmath26 kev @xcite are employed , the observed flux of 1 photon @xmath8 s@xmath22 in the 220 kev band corresponds to the bolometric luminosity of @xmath27 erg s@xmath22 in an isotropic emission source .",
    "we use the conversion factor to estimate the luminosity form the maxi / gsc data , hereafter .",
    "the scale of the estimated luminosity is shown at the right - hand ordinate of the light - curve ( figure [ fig : gsclc ] top ) .    1 from 2009 august 15 ( mjd 55058 ) to 2014 january 21 ( mjd 56678 ) in 1-d time bin",

    "the fermi gbm pulsar project provides results of timing analysis of a number of positively detected x - ray pulsars , including their pulse periods and pulsed fluxes @xcite .",
    "we utilized the archived results of gx 304@xmath01 to systematically investigate the long - term variations of the pulse timing from 2010 to 2013 .",
    "figure [ fig : gsclc ] ( bottom ) shows time variations of the barycentric pulse period and the pulsed photon flux in the 2550 kev band of gx 304@xmath01 , as made publicly available by the project .",
    "the pulsed emission was detected over bright phases of the nine consecutive outbursts from b to j. the period range of 275.2275.6 s during the outburst c is consistent with the results of 275.37 s from the rxte data @xcite and 275.46 s from the suzaku data @xcite , both obtained in the same outbursts .",
    "the rxte observations of gx 304@xmath01 were performed on the outbursts b , c , d , and e , using the proportional counter array ( pca : @xcite ) operating in 360 kev and the high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte : @xcite ) providing 20250 kev data .",
    "as indicated in figure [ fig : gsclc ] ( top ) , total 71 observations covered the outbursts c , d , and e with a high frequency of almost once per day , each with an exposure of 0.518 ks .",
    "we analyzed the pca data to study the pulse timing properties with photon statistics and time resolution better than those available with other instruments .",
    "data reduction and analysis were performed using the standard rxte analysis tools released as a part of heasoft 6.14 , and the caldb files of version 20111205 provided by nasa / gsfc .",
    "all the data were first screened with the standard selection criteria , that the spacecraft pointing offset should be smaller than 0.02 , the earth - limb elevation angle be larger than 10@xmath28 , and the time since the last saa passage be longer than 30 minutes .",
    "we used data only from the top layer of the pcu-2 unit , which is the best calibrated among all pcus . in the timing analysis",
    ", we used the reduced data with good - xenon data mode , generic event - data mode ( e_125us_64m_0_1s ) , or generic binned - data mode ( b_250ms_128m_0_254 ) , which has a time resolution better than 0.25 s.",
    "to quantify the outburst periodicity , we determined their peak epochs by fitting each profile with a gaussian function .",
    "since some of the peaks have asymmetric profiles and hence can not be approximated by a single gaussian function , the fit was performed within a narrow span of @xmath29 d around each peak so that the fit is reasonably accepted .",
    "if outburst has multiple peaks , their peak epochs were determined separately .",
    "table [ tab : outpeak ] summarizes the obtained epochs , fluxes , and the luminosities estimated from the typical energy spectrum at the peaks .",
    "x - ray outbursts of be x - ray binaries are known to be largely classified into normal - type ( type - i ) and giant - type ( type - ii ) ones ( e.g. review by @xcite ) .",
    "the normal outbursts emerge near the pulsar periastron passage and their peak luminosity reaches @xmath30 erg s@xmath22 , while the giant ones may appear at any orbital phase and can be significantly luminous than the other type of events .",
    "the regular periodicity of the observed outbursts suggests that they are mostly categorized into the normal type .",
    "actually , the first seven outbursts from a to g , with a single - peak profile , satisfy all the normal - type conditions .",
    "similarly , the outbursts observed in 19711972 with vela 5b also exhibited the same periodicity and their peak fluxes were in the same level @xcite .",
    "therefore , they should be categorized into the normal type , too . to refine the orbital period",
    ", we extrapolated the periodicity of the 20092012 outbursts ( a to g ) to that in 19711972 assuming that they are at the same orbital phase .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : lc_phase ] shows a plot of the peak epochs @xmath31 in 20092013 against the number @xmath32 of 132.2-d cycles from the initial epoch of mjd 41675.6 ( 1972 december 14 ) in vela 5b era .",
    "thus , the epochs @xmath31 of @xmath33 ( mjd 41675.6 ) and @xmath34102108 ( outbursts a g ) line up linearly , around which the data of @xmath34102108 scatter by 2.1 d in the standard deviation .",

    "the light curves of the outbursts a to g in figure [ fig : lc_orb ] ( left ) reconfirm that their peak epoch agrees , within a scatter of 2.1 d with the prediction of the best - fit cycle . however , these profiles vary considerably from cycle to cycle .",
    "while the outburst d has a slight enhancement over the symmetrical profile to the peak , the outbursts f and g have a subsequent small peak after the main peak .",
    "as expected from figure [ fig : gsclc ] , the outbursts h and i , the latter being the brightest , clearly deviate in figure [ fig : lc_phase ] and figure [ fig : lc_orb ] form equation ( [ equ : peakepoch ] ) , because they both show a double - peaked profiles .",
    "this suggests that these two , or at least outburst i , are possibly the giant outbursts . in the outburst j , no distinct main peak is seen and a low - level activity continued for 40 days .    during bright outburst phases ,",
    "the two hardness ratios in figure [ fig : lc_orb ] ( right ) slightly change with a positive correlation to the flux .",
    "in addition , the ( 410 kev / 24 kev ) hardness ratio exhibits sharp increases at the peak in the outbursts e , f , and g. they correspond to dips in the softest light curve ( red ) , and thus can be attributed to an increase of the absorption column density .          to investigate the change in the pulse period with a better precision and sensitivity than those available with the fermi gbm shown in red in figure [ fig : gsclc ] ( bottom )",
    ", we analyzed the rxte pca data , which samples the outbursts c , d , and e on the almost daily basis .",
    "the data for the outburst c has been already analyzed by @xcite and the results revealed a complex pulse profile that depends on the energy and the luminosity .",

    "the large variability in the pca count rate around the outburst peaks represent the variation component other than the 275-s pulsation , as @xcite reported in the outburst c.    we performed the pulse period search by the folding method using efsearch in xronos , for the pca data after the barycentric correction was applied with faxbary in ftool . to optimize the period determination accuracy ,",
    "the folding analysis was carried out by combining data taken within each interval up to 2 days .",
    "the energy band was limited to 26 kev because the sharp dip structure in the pulse profile below 8 kev @xcite .",
    "the errors on the obtained pulse period was estimated by the method of using the folded pulse profile with 64 phase bins .",
    "figure [ fig : pulsep ] ( bottom ) show the obtained pulse period against the observation epochs , where the results of the fermi gbm pulsar project , the same as in figure [ fig : gsclc ] , are plotted together .",
    "the rxte / pca and the fermi / gbm results are consistent with each other .              the pulse - period evolution in figures [ fig : gsclc ] and [ fig : pulsep ]",
    "is characterized by two distinct effects .",
    "one is cyclic modulation synchronized with the 132.2 d outburst period , considered as due to the orbital doppler effects .",
    "the other is a secular spin - up trend over the 3 years , obviously due to the accretion torque .",
    "thus , the observed pulse - period evolution is considered to be a complex composite of these two effects .",
    "since both of them are supposed to depend on the orbital phase , it is not straightforward to separate them .",
    "hence , we construct a semi - empirical model representing the two effects , and then fit it to the data , in an attempt to simultaneously determine the orbital elements and the luminosity - dependent intrinsic pulse period change .",
    "be xbps are known to exhibit spin - up episodes during bright outburst phases ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is naturally explained by an increase in the accretion rate , and the associated transfer of the angular momentum to the neutron star via disc - magnetosphare interactions .",
    "in the classical theoretical model by @xcite , the pulsar spin - up rate @xmath95 ( s yr@xmath22 ) is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 are the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron star in units of @xmath103 g @xmath104 , radius in @xmath105 cm , mass in @xmath106 , moment of inertia in @xmath107 g @xmath21 , spin in s , and the luminosity in @xmath44 erg s@xmath22 , respectively , while @xmath108 is a dimensionless torque that depends on the fastness parameter @xmath109 , defined by the ratio of the angular velocity of the pulsar spin to that of the kepler rotation of accreting matter at around the alfven radius .",
    "in the application of ( [ equ : pdot ] ) , gx 304@xmath01 is particularly suited for several reasons .",
    "second , a continuous record of @xmath102 is available from the maxi gsc light curve ; we calculate it with the conversion factor as described in section [ sec : obs_maxi ] .",
    "furthermore , @xmath110 can be regarded approximately as a constant from the long spin period , @xmath111 s , such that @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "@xmath113 combining these pieces of information , equation ( [ equ : pdot ] ) yields @xmath114    equation ( [ equ : pdot ] ) implies that the spin - up rate @xmath115 follows the luminosity @xmath116 as @xmath117 .",
    "the relation has been calibrated with actual x - ray data . besides this , the comparison of absolute spin - up rates with equation ( [ equ : pdot ] ) has been hampered by a large uncertainty in the bolometric luminosity correction , which is in turn due to beaming effects ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we hence employ a spin - up model expressed by @xmath118 in which the power - law index and the constant coefficient @xmath119 are treated as free parameters .",
    "xbps are also known to spin down during the quiescence due to the propeller effects .",
    "in fact , gx 304@xmath01 exhibited a spin down by @xmath120 s for the 28 years of quiescence from 1980 to 2008 , with an average period derivative of @xmath121 s s@xmath22 .",
    "the rate , though much smaller than the spin - up rate during bright phases ( @xmath122 s s@xmath22 ) , may not be negligible .",
    "we accounted its contribution with a constant spin - down parameter , @xmath123 , added to @xmath124 as an offset .    by using the spin - up and spin - down models discussed above",
    ", the intrinsic period @xmath125 is expressed as @xmath126 where we set the time origin @xmath127 at the periastron passage in the outburst c and denote the pulse period at @xmath127 as @xmath128 .",
    "the period modulation due to the binary motion , can be calculated using the binary orbital elements , which consists of the orbital period @xmath129 , the eccentricity @xmath130 , the projected semi - major axis @xmath131 , the argument of the periastron @xmath132 , and the epoch of periastron passage which we identified with @xmath127 defined above .",
    "the pulsar orbital velocity @xmath133 along the line of sight is given as @xmath134 where @xmath135 is a parameter called `` true anomaly '' describing the motion on the elliptical orbit , and calculated from the kepler s equation .",

    "the model involves nine free parameters ; @xmath138 , @xmath119 , @xmath123 , and @xmath139 in equation ( [ equ : deltapmodel ] ) , and orbital elements in equation ( [ equ : vl ] ) .",
    "we fixed the orbital period @xmath129 at 132.189 d derived from the outburst cycle over 28 years in section [ sec : ana_outper ] , and examine the fit with @xmath139 fixted at the theoretical value of 6/7 or free .",

    "the rate is consistent with the average period derivative of @xmath146 s s@xmath22 during the 1980 - 2008 quiescence .    comparing the two model - fit results ( @xmath140 and @xmath139 free ) , goodness of fits ( @xmath147 / dof )",

    "<S> these 12 outbursts , together with those in the 1970s , were found to all recur with a well defined period of 132.189@xmath20.02 d , which can be identified with the orbital period . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse period at @xmath3 s , obtained from the rxte / pca and fermi / gbm data , apparently exhibited a periodic modulation synchronized with the outburst period , suggesting the pulsar orbital motion , which is superposed on a secular spin - up trend throughout the entire active phase . </S>",
    "<S> the observed pulse - period changes were successfully represented by a model composed of the binary orbital modulation and pulsar spin up caused by mass accretion through an accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital elements obtained from the best - fit model , including the projected orbital semi - major axis @xmath4 light - s and an eccentricity @xmath5 , are typical of be binary x - ray pulsars . </S>"
