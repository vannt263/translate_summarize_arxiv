    "however , the microscopic origin of such feeding has been discussed controversially in the literature .",
    "shake - up processes in charged quantum dots  @xcite and quasi - continuum excitonic transitions  @xcite have been suggested as possible processes for populating the cavity mode , even in presence of large detuning of several tens of mev . for smaller detunings , of the order of a few mev",

    "it is now well established that phonon dephasing  @xcite and relaxation  @xcite govern the coherent optical response of quantum dots .",
    "as for cavity - qed , theoretical work has suggested that such pure phonon dephasing might be responsible for cavity feeding at detunings of the order of the polariton linewidths .",
    "@xcite experimental work has confirmed that for such small detunings dephasing plays a crucial role .",

    "we start with a description of the excitonic states in terms of a generic two level system , where @xmath0 denotes the excited and @xmath1 the ground state .",
    "although we shall be primarily concerned with the exciton to groundstate decay , our description scheme also applies to the biexciton to exciton decay . with the quantum dot operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 the bosonic annihilation operators for the cavity mode and the @xmath6th phonon mode ( with energies @xmath7 and @xmath8 )",

    "@xcite through @xmath16 exciton and cavity become coupled , and new polariton modes are formed which have partial exciton and partial cavity character .",
    "@xcite in the strong coupling regime , the coupling is stronger than the quantum dot and cavity losses , and excitation is coherently transferred between the dot and the cavity .",
    "in contrast , in the weak coupling regime losses dominate over the coherent coupling , and the excited state decays mono - exponentially . quite generally , the calculation of the phonon - assisted scattering rates , to be discussed below , works in both the strong and weak coupling regime , and we thus will not be specific about this point until sec .  [",

    "we have used the adiabatic approximation of letting the lower integration limit approach minus infinity and introducing a small damping term inside the integral ( not shown ) , which allows us to perform the time integration prior to the phonon trace .",
    "@xcite from eq .",
    "we can infer the scattering rate @xmath37 for a transition from the initial state @xmath31 to the final state @xmath32 .",
    "to arrive at our final expression , we have exploited the cyclic permutation of operators under the trace .",
    "the generalized fermi golden rule expression of eq .   will serve us as the starting point for the calculation of the phonon - assisted scattering rates .",
    "the decay of an exciton to the cavity under off - resonant conditions requires both the coupling between states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , by means of the exciton - cavity hamiltonian @xmath16 , and the emission or absorption of a phonon , in order to compensate for the energy mismatch .",
