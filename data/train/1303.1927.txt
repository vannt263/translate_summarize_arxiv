    "in a variety of applications researchers are interested in comparing two treatment groups on the basis of several , potentially dependent outcomes .",
    "for example , to evaluate if a chemical is a neuro - toxicant , toxicologists compare a treated group of animals with an untreated control group in terms of various correlated outcomes such as tail - pinch response , click response and gait score , etc . ;",
    "the statistical problem of interest is to compare the multivariate distributions of the outcomes in the control and treatment groups .",
    "moreover , the outcome distributions are expected to be ordered in some sense .",
    "the theory of stochastic order relations [ @xcite ] provides the theoretical foundation for such comparisons .    to fix ideas let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be @xmath2-dimensional random variables ( rvs ) ;",
    "@xmath0 is said to be smaller than @xmath1 in the multivariate stochastic order , denoted @xmath3 , provided @xmath4 for all upper sets @xmath5 [ @xcite ] .",
    "if for some upper set the above inequality is sharp , we say that @xmath0 is strictly smaller than @xmath1 ( in the multivariate stochastic order ) which we denote by @xmath6 . recall that a set @xmath7 is called an upper set if @xmath8 implies that @xmath9 whenever @xmath10 @xmath11 , that is , if @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "note that comparing @xmath0 and @xmath1 with respect to the multivariate stochastic order requires comparing their distributions over all upper sets in @xmath14 .",
    "this turns out to be a very high - dimensional problem .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are multivariate binary rvs , then @xmath3 provided @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the corresponding probability mass functions . here",
    "@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the family of upper sets defined on the support of a @xmath2-dimensional multivariate binary rv .",
    "it turns out that the cardinality of @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath20 , grows super - exponentially with @xmath2 .",
    "in fact @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are also known , but @xmath29 is not . however , good approximations for @xmath20 are available for all @xmath2 ; cf .",
    "obviously the number of upper sets for general multivariate rvs is much larger . since in many applications",
    "@xmath2 is large , it would seem that the analysis of high - dimensional stochastically ordered data is practically hopeless . as a consequence ,",
    "the methodology for analyzing multivariate ordered data is underdeveloped .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xcite as well as @xcite studied stochastically ordered bivariate multinomial distributions .",
    "they noted the difficulty of extending their methodology to high - dimensional data due to the large number of constraints that need to be imposed .",
    "recently @xcite proposed a framework for testing for order among @xmath30 , @xmath2-dimensional , ordered multivariate binary distributions .    in this paper",
    "we address the dimensionality problem by considering an easy to understand stochastic order which we refer to as the linear stochastic order .",
    "[ def - lst]the rv @xmath0 is said to be smaller than the rv @xmath1 in the ( multivariate ) linear stochastic order , denoted @xmath31 , if for all @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 in ( [ l - st ] ) denotes the usual ( univariate ) stochastic order .",
    "note that it is enough to limit ( [ l - st ] ) to all nonnegative real vectors satisfying @xmath36 , and accordingly we denote by @xmath37 the positive part of the unit sphere in @xmath38 .",
    "we call each @xmath39 a `` direction . '' in other words the rvs @xmath0 and @xmath1 are ordered by the linear stochastic order if every nonnegative linear combination of their components is ordered by the usual ( univariate ) stochastic order .",
    "thus instead of considering all upper sets in @xmath38 we need for each @xmath39 to consider only upper sets in @xmath40 .",
    "this is a substantial reduction in dimensionality .",
    "in fact we will show that only one value of @xmath41 need be considered .",
    "note that the linear stochastic order , like the multivariate stochastic order , is a generalization of the usual univariate stochastic order to multivariate data .",
    "both of these orders indicate , in different ways , that one random vector is more likely than another to take on large values . in this paper",
    "we develop the statistical theory and methodology for estimation and testing for linearly ordered multivariate distributions . for completeness we note that weaker notions of the linear stochastic order are discussed by @xcite and applied to various optimization problems in queuing and finance .    comparing linear combinations",
    "has a long history in statistics .",
    "for example , in phase i clinical trials it is common to compare dose groups using an overall measure of toxicity . typically , this quantity is an ad hoc weighted average of individual toxicities where the weights are often known as `` severity weights ; '' cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . this strategy of dimension reduction is not new in the statistical literature and has been used in classical multivariate analysis when comparing two or more multivariate normal populations .",
    "for example , using the union - intersection principle , the comparison of multivariate normal populations can be reduced to the comparison of all possible linear combinations of their mean vectors .",
    "this approach is the basis of roy s classical largest root test [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "our proposed test may be viewed as nonparametric generalization of the classical normal theory method described above with the exception that we limit consideration only to nonnegative linear combinations ( rather than all possible linear combinations ) since our main focus is to make comparisons in terms of stochastic order .",
    "we emphasize that the linear stochastic order will allow us to address the much broader problem of directional ordering for multivariate ordered data , that is , to find the direction which best separates two ordered distributions . based on our survey of the literature",
    ", we are not aware of any methodology that addresses the problems investigated here .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in section  [ sec2 ] some probabilistic properties of the linear stochastic order",
    "are explored , and its relationships with other multivariate stochastic orders are clarified . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we provide the background and motivation for directional inference under the linear stochastic order and develop estimation and testing procedure for independent as well as paired samples .",
    "in particular the estimator of the best separating direction is presented and its large sampling properties derived .",
    "we note that the problem of estimating the best separating direction is a nonsmooth optimization problem .",
    "the limiting distribution of the best separating direction is derived in a variety of settings .",
    "tests for the linear stochastic order based on the best separating direction are also developed .",
    "one advantage of our approach is that it avoids the estimation of multivariate distributions subject to order restrictions .",
    "simulation results , presented in section  [ sec4 ] , reveal that for large sample sizes the proposed estimator has negligible bias and mean squared error ( mse ) .",
    "the bias and mse seem to depend on the true value of the best separating direction , the dependence structure and the dimension of the problem .",
    "furthermore , the proposed test honors the nominal type i error rate and has sufficient power . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    "we illustrate the methodology using data obtained from the national toxicology program ( ntp ) .",
    "concluding remarks and some open research problems are provided in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "for convenience all proofs are provided in the where additional concepts are defined when needed .",
    "we start by clarifying the relationship between the linear stochastic order and the multivariate stochastic order .",

    "theorem  [ thm - closure ] shows that the linear stochastic order is closed under increasing linear transformations , marginalization , mixtures , conjugations and convergence . in particular parts ( ii ) and ( iii ) of theorem  [ thm - closure ]",
    "imply that if @xmath31 , then @xmath69 and @xmath70 for all @xmath71 and @xmath72 ; that is , all marginals are ordered as are all convolutions .",
    "although the multivariate stochastic order is in general stronger than the linear stochastic order , there are situation in which both orders coincide .",

    "thus theorem  [ thm - ervs ] shows that the multivariate stochastic order coincides with the linear stochastic order in the normal family .",
    "incidentally , in the proof of theorem  [ thm - ervs ] we generalize the results of @xcite on multivariate stochastic ordering of elliptical rvs .",
    "another interesting example is the following :    [ thm - mvbs]let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be multivariate binary rvs .",
    "then @xmath31 is equivalent to @xmath3 if and only if @xmath75 .    in the proof of theorem  [ thm - ervs ] distributional properties of the elliptical family play a major role .",
    "in contrast , theorem [ thm - mvbs ] is a consequence of the geometry of the upper sets of multivariate binary rvs which turn out to be upper half planes if and only if @xmath75 .",

    "@xcite ] , then the linear and multivariate stochastic orders coincide .",
    "such situations arise when the correlation structure among outcomes is not expected to vary with dose .",
    "the orthant orders are also of interest in statistical applications .",

    "the lower orthant order is similarly defined ; cf .",
    "@xcite or @xcite .",

    ". in general the linear stochastic order does not imply the upper ( or lower ) orthant order , nor is the converse true .",
    "however , as stated below , under some conditions on the copula functions , the linear stochastic order implies the upper ( or lower ) orthant order .",
    "[ thm - ort]if @xmath31 and @xmath84 for all @xmath85^{p}$ ] , then @xmath86 .",

    "our objective is to extend and generalize the classical multivariate method , described above , to nonnormal multivariate ordered data",
    ". our approach will be nonparametric . recall that comparing mvns is done by considering the family of statistics @xmath115 for all @xmath116 @xmath14 .",
    "in the case of nonnormal populations , the population mean alone may not be enough to characterize the distribution .",
    "in such cases , it may not be sufficient to compare the means of the populations but one may have to compare entire distributions .",
    "one possible way of doing so is by considering rank statistics .",
    "suppose @xmath59 and @xmath117 are independent random samples from two multivariate populations .",
    "let @xmath118 be the rank of @xmath119 in the combined sample @xmath120 . for fixed @xmath121 the distributions of @xmath122 and @xmath123 can be compared using a rank test .",
    "for example , if we use @xmath124 our comparison is done in terms of wilcoxon s rank sum statistics .",
    "it is well known that rank tests are well suited for testing for univariate stochastic order [ cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ] where the restrictions that @xmath39 must be made .",
    "although any rank test can be used , the mann ",
    "whitney form of wilcooxon s ( wmw ) statistic is particularly attractive in this application .",
    "therefore in the rest of this paper we develop estimation and testing procedures for the linear stochastic order based on the family of statistics@xmath125 where @xmath41 varies over @xmath37 .",
    "note that ( [ psi - nm ] ) unbiasedly estimates@xmath126 the following result is somewhat surprising .",

    "proposition  [ prop - smax ] shows that the direction which separates the means , in the sense of roy , also maximizes ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "thus it provides further support for choosing ( [ psi - nm ] ) as our test statistic . note that in general @xmath130 may not belong to @xmath37 .",
    "since we focus on the linear statistical order , we restrict ourselves to @xmath131 .",
    "consequently we define @xmath132 and refer to @xmath133 as the best separating direction . further note that if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are independent and continuous and if @xmath31 , then @xmath134 for all @xmath39 .",
    "this simply means that @xmath122 tends to be smaller than @xmath123 more than @xmath135 of the time .",
    "note that probabilities of type ( [ psi ] ) were introduced by @xcite and further studied by @xcite for comparing estimators .",
    "random variables satisfying such a condition are said to be ordered by the precedence order [ @xcite ] .",
    "once @xmath133 is estimated we can plug it into ( [ psi - nm ] ) to get a test statistic .",
    "hence our test may be viewed as a natural generalization of roy s largest root test from mvns to arbitrary ordered distributions . however , unlike roy s method , which does not explicitly estimate @xmath133 , we do . on the other hand",
    "the proposed test does not require the computation of the inverse of the sample covariance matrix whereas roy s test and hotteling s @xmath110 test require such computations .",

    "are independent for all @xmath71 and @xmath72 and therefore the probability @xmath139 is independent of both @xmath71 and  @xmath72 .",
    "however , in many applications such as repeated measurement and crossover designs , the data are a random sample of dependent pairs @xmath140 for which @xmath141 are i.i.d .",
    "for example , such a situation may arise when @xmath142 and @xmath143 , where @xmath144 are pair - specific random effects and the rvs @xmath145 ( as well as @xmath146 ) are i.i.d .",
    "in this situation @xmath147 is independent of @xmath71 and @xmath133 is well defined .",

    "the maximizer of ( [ psi - nm - z ] ) is denoted by @xmath152 , that is,@xmath153 finding ( [ s - max - hat ] ) with @xmath39 is a nonsmooth optimization problem .",
    "consider first the situation where @xmath154 . in this case",
    "we maximize ( [ psi - nm - z ] ) subject to @xmath155 .",
    "geometrically @xmath156 is a quarter circle spanning the first quadrant .",
    "now let @xmath157 , and without any loss of generality assume that @xmath158 .",
    "we examine the behavior of the function @xmath159 as a function of @xmath41 . clearly if @xmath160 , that is , if @xmath161 , then for all @xmath162 we have @xmath163 . in other words any value of @xmath41 on the arc @xmath156 maximizes @xmath164 . similarly if @xmath165 then for all @xmath162 we have @xmath166 and again the entire arc @xmath156 maximizes @xmath167 .",
    "now let @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",

    "the value of @xmath173 is given by ( [ z->theta ] ) .",
    "in other words each @xmath57 is mapped to an arc on @xmath177 as described above .",
    "now , the function ( [ psi - nm - z ] ) simply counts the number of arcs covering each @xmath162 .",
    "the maximizer of ( [ psi - nm - z ] ) lies in the region where the maximum number of arcs overlap .",
    "clearly this implies that the maximizer of ( [ psi - nm - z ] ) is not unique . a quick way to find",

    "that is , for @xmath190 , each observation @xmath179 is associated with a `` slice '' of @xmath37 .",
    "the boundaries of the slice are the intersection of @xmath37 and some half - plane .",
    "note that when @xmath154 the slices are arcs .",
    "the shape of the slice depends on the quadrant to which @xmath179 belongs .",
    "the maximizer of ( [ psi - nm ] ) is again the value of @xmath41 which belongs to the largest number of slices .",
    "although the geometry of the resulting optimization problem is easy to understand , we have not been able to devise a simple algorithm , which scales with @xmath2 , based on the ideas above .",
    "however , we have found that ( [ s - max - hat ] ) can be obtained by converting the data into polar coordinates and then using the nelder ",
    "mead algorithm which does not require the objective function to be differentiable .",
    "we emphasize that this maximization process results in a single maximizer of ( [ psi - nm ] ) and we do not attempt to find the entire set of maximizers . for completness",
    "we note that there are methods for optimizing ( [ psi - nm ] ) specifically designed for nonsmooth problems . for more details see @xcite and @xcite and the references therein for both algorithms and convergence results .",
    "it is clear that the estimation procedure for paired samples is the same as for independent samples .",
    "we find three different asymptotic regimes for @xmath191 depending on distributional assumptions and the sampling scheme ( paired versus independent samples ) .",
    "note that the parameter space is the unit sphere not the usual euclidian space .",
    "there are several ways of dealing with this irregularity , one of which is to re - express the last coordinate of @xmath39 as @xmath192 and consider the parameter space @xmath193 which is a compact subset of  @xmath194 . clearly these parameterizations are equivalent , and without any further ambiguity we will denote them both by @xmath37 .",
    "thus in the proofs below both views of @xmath37 are used interchangeably as convenient .",
    "we begin our discussion with independent samples assuming continuous distributions for both @xmath0 and @xmath195    [ them - lst1]let @xmath0 and @xmath1 have continuously differentiable densities .",
    "if @xmath196 is uniquely maximized by @xmath197 .",
    "then @xmath198 , the maximizer of ( [ psi - nm ] ) , is strongly consistent , that is , @xmath199 .",
    "furthermore @xmath200 where @xmath201 finally , if @xmath202 then@xmath203 where the matrix @xmath97 is defined in the body of the proof .",
    "although ( [ psi - nm ] ) is not continuous ( nor differentiable ) its @xmath204-statistic structure guarantees that it is `` almost '' so [ i.e. , it is continuous up to an @xmath205 term ] , and therefore its maximizer converges at a @xmath206 rate to a normal limit [ @xcite ] .",
    "we also note that it is difficult to estimate the asymptotic variance @xmath97 directly since it depends on unknown functions ( @xmath207 and @xmath208 for @xmath209 are defined in the body of the proof ) . nevertheless bootstrap variance estimates are easily derived .",
    "note that if either @xmath0 or @xmath1 are continuous rvs , then @xmath196 is continuous .",

    "the condition above is satisfied by location scale families , and it may be convenient to think of @xmath214 and @xmath97 as the location and scale parameters for @xmath57 . in general",
    ", however , @xmath196 may not have a unique maximum nor be continuous .",
    "for example , if both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are discrete rvs , then @xmath196 is a step function . in such situations @xmath133",
    "is set valued , and we may denote it by @xmath215 .",
    "as we have seen earlier the maximizer of @xmath216 is always set valued ( typically , however , we find only one maximizer ) .",
    "consider , for example , the case where @xmath217 and let @xmath218 , and @xmath219 for some @xmath220 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath6 .",
    "further note that @xmath221 and it follows that @xmath196 is constant on @xmath156 which implies that @xmath222 coincides with @xmath156 .",
    "similarly @xmath216 is constant on @xmath156 and therefore @xmath223 for all @xmath224 .",
    "this means that consistency is guaranteed and the limiting distribution is degenerate .",
    "more generally , we have :    [ them - lst2]if @xmath0 and @xmath1 have discrete distributions with finite support and @xmath198 is a maximizer of ( [ psi - nm ] ) , then@xmath225 for some positive constants @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "theorem  [ them - lst2 ] shows that the probability that a maximizer of @xmath228 is not in @xmath222 is exponentially small when the underlying distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are discrete .",
    "hence @xmath198 is consistent and converges exponentially fast .",
    "in fact the proof of theorem  [ them - lst2 ] implies that @xmath229 ; that is , the set of maximizers of @xmath230 converges to the set of maximizers of @xmath231 ; that is , @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the hausdroff metric defined on compact sets .",

    "prior to conducting a two - year rodent cancer bioassay to evaluate the toxicity / carcinogenicity of a chemical , the national toxicology program ( ntp ) routinely conducts a 90-day pre - chronic dose finding study .",
    "one of the goals of the 90-day study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose ( mtd ) that can be used in the two - year chronic exposure study .",
    "accurate determination of the mtd is critical for the success of the two - year cancer bioassay .",
    "cancer bioassays are typically very expensive and time consuming .",
    "therefore their proper design , that is , choosing the correct dosing levels , is very important .",
    "when the highest dose used in the two - year study exceeds the mtd , a large proportion of animals in the high dose group(s ) may die well before the end of the study , and the data from such group(s ) can not be used reliably .",
    "this results in inefficiency and wasted resources .",
    "typically the ntp uses the 90-day study to determine the mtd on the basis of a large number of correlated endpoints that provide information regarding toxicity .",
    "these include body weight , organ weights , clinical chemistry ( red blood cell counts , cell volume , hemoglobin , hematocrit , lymphocytes , etc . ) , histopathology ( lesions in various target organs ) , number of deaths and so forth .",
    "the dose response data is analyzed for each variable separately using dunnett s or the williams s test ( or their nonparametric versions , dunn s test and shirley s test , resp . ) .",
    "ntp combines results from all such analyses qualitatively and uses other biological and toxicological information when making decisions regarding the highest dose for the two - year cancer bioassay .",
    "analyzing correlated variables one at a time may result in loss of information .",
    "the proposed methodology provides a convenient method to combine information from several outcome variables to make comparisons between groups .",
    "we now illustrate our methodology by re - analyzing data obtained from a recent ntp study of the chemical citral [ @xcite ] .",
    "citral is a flavoring agent that is widely used in a variety of food items .",
    "the ntp assigned a random sample of 10 male rats to the control group and 10 to the 1785 mg / kg dose group .",
    "hematological and clinical chemistry measurements such as the number of platelets ( in 1000  per l ) , urea nitrogen ( un ) ( in mg / dl ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ap ) ( in iu / l ) and bile acids ( ba ) ( in mol / l ) were recorded on each animal at the end of the study .",
    "the ntp performed univariate analysis on each of these variables and found no significant difference between the control and dose group except for the concentration of urea nitrogen which was increased in the high dose group .",
    "this increase was marginally significant at the @xmath361 level and not at all after correcting for multiplicity .",
    "we applied the proposed methodology to compare the control with the high - dose group ( 1785 mg / kg ) in terms of all nonnegative linear combinations of the above mentioned four variables .",
    "we test the null hypothesis of no difference between the control and the high - dose group against the alternative that the high - dose group is stochastically larger ( in the above four variables ) than the control group .",
    "the resulting @xmath2-value based on 10,000 bootstrap samples was @xmath362 , which is significant at a @xmath361 level of significance .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath363 was @xmath364 and the estimated 95% confidence region is given by @xmath365 .",
    "hence the confidence set includes any @xmath41 which is within @xmath366 degrees of @xmath198 .",
    "this is a relatively large set due to the small sample sizes .",
    "clearly our methodology appears to be sensitive to detect statistical differences which were not noted by ntp .",
    "furthermore , our methodology allows us to infer that indeed 1785 mg / kg dose group is larger in the multivariate stochastic order than the control group .",
    "this is a much stronger conclusion than the simple ordering of their means .",
    "thus we believe that the proposed framework and methodology for studying ordered distributions can serve as a useful tool in toxicology and is also applicable to a wide range of other problems as alluded to in this paper .",
    "in many applications , researchers are interested in comparing two experimental conditions , for example , a treatment and a control group , in terms of a multivariate response . in classical multivariate analysis one",
    "addresses such problems by comparing the mean vectors using hotelling s @xmath110 statistic .",
    "the assumption of mvn , underlying hotelling s @xmath110 test , may not hold in practice .",
    "moreover if the data is not mvn , then the comparison of population means may not always provide complete information regarding the differences between the two experimental groups . secondly ,",
    "hotelling s @xmath367 statistics are designed for two - sided alternatives and may not be ideal if a researcher is interested in one - sided , that is , ordered alternatives .",
    "addressing such problems requires one to compare the two experimental groups nonparametrically in terms of the multivariate stochastic order .",
    "such comparisons , however , are very high dimensional and not easy to perform .    in this article",
    "we circumvent this challenge by considering the notion of the linear stochastic order between two random vectors .",
    "the linear stochastic order is a `` weak '' generalization of the univariate stochastic order .",
    "the linear stochastic order is simple to interpret and has an intuitive appeal . using this notion of ordering , we developed nonparametric directional inference procedures",
    ". intuitively , the proposed methodology seeks to determine the direction that best separates two multivariate populations .",
    "asymptotic properties of the estimated direction are derived .",
    "our test based on the best separating direction may be viewed as a generalization of roy s classical largest root test for comparing several mvn populations . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first general test for multivariate ordered distributions . since in practice sample sizes are small , we use the bootstrap methodology for drawing inferences .",
    "we illustrated the proposed methodology using a data obtained from a recent toxicity / carcinogenicity study conducted by the us national toxicology program ( ntp ) on the chemical citral .",
    "a re - analysis of their 90-day data using our proposed methodology revealed a linear stochastic increase in platelets , urea nitrogen , alkaline phosphatase and bile acids in the high - dose group relative to the control group , which was not seen in the original univariate analysis conducted by the ntp .",
    "these findings suggest that the proposed methodology may have greater sensitivity than the commonly used univariate statistical procedures .",
    "our methodology is sufficiently general since it is nonparametric and can be applied to discrete and/or continuous outcome variables .",
    "furthermore , our methodology exploits the underlying dependence structure in the data , rather than analyzing one variable at a time .",
    "we note that our example and some of our results pertain to continuous rvs .",
    "however , the methodology may be used , with appropriate modification ( e.g. , methods for dealing with ties ) with discrete ( or mixed ) data with no problem .",
    "although the focus of this paper has been the comparison of two multivariate vectors , in many applications , especially in dose response studies , researchers may be interested in determining trends ( order ) among several groups . similarly to classical parametric order restricted inference literature , one could generalize the methodology developed in this paper to test for order restrictions among multiple populations .",
    "for example , one could extend the results to @xmath368 rvs ordered by the simple ordering , that is , @xmath369 or to rvs ordered by the tree ordering , that is , @xmath370 where @xmath371 . as pointed out by a referee the hypotheses @xmath372 versus @xmath373 can also be formulated and tested using the approach described .",
    "first note that the null hypothesis implies @xmath134 for all @xmath39 . on the other hand under the alternative",
    "there is an @xmath39 for which @xmath374 .",
    "thus a test may be based on the statistic@xmath375 where @xmath376 is the value which minimizes @xmath216 .",
    "it is also clear that the least favorable configuration occurs when @xmath377 for all @xmath39 which is equivalent to @xmath378 .",
    "we believe that the result obtained here may be useful beyond order restricted inference .",
    "our simulation study suggests that our estimator of the best separating direction , that is , ( [ s - max - hat ] ) may be useful even in the context of classical multivariate analysis where it may be viewed as a robust alternative to roy s classical estimate .",
    "finally we note that the linear stochastic order may be useful in a variety of other statistical problems .",
    "for example , we believe that it provides a useful framework for linearly combining the results of several diagnostic markers . this is a well - known problem in the context of roc curve analysis in diagnostic medicine .",
