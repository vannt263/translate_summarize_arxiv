    "relativistic plasma outflows occur in the most powerful sources in the universe .",
    "the inferred lorentz factors vary from @xmath0 in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to @xmath1 in gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) .    in agn",
    ", it is widely believed that magnetic fields play a key role in launching and driving the observed jets , but how far away from the source ( e.g. a few engine radii vs. parsec scales ) the flows remain poynting flux dominated is unresolved . a related debate for grb is whether the relativistic outflows are powered by hot matter dominated outflows ( mdo ) or cold poynting flux dominated outflows ( pfdos ) . in the latter , the energy is carried electromagnetically to great distances where it is finally converted to particle energy . for grb ,",
    "mdo s are constrained by the fact that too much baryon loading prevents the flow from reaching the large lorentz factors needed to overcome the compactness problem  @xcite .",
    "the total energy density must greatly exceed the rest mass energy density of the outflow .",
    "in contrast pdfo s can in principle transport large amounts of energy through a vacuum without much matter .",
    "poynting flux driving is a part of a number of models : tori in neutron star mergers  @xcite , highly magnetized millisecond pulsars  @xcite , and collapsars  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "see also the recent comprehensive study of  @xcite .    for pfdos ,",
    "the particle acceleration occurs from dissipation of the magnetic energy .",
    "understanding the physics thereof requires studying relativistic collisionless plasmas .",
    "several mechanisms of pfdo dissipation have been proposed in the literature .",
    "direct dissipation of magnetic energy by fast reconnection has been considered  @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "@xcite modeled the interaction of a strongly magnetized wind with an external medium . in the wind rest frame",
    "this scenario is identical to the collision of a wide relativistic cold beam of particles with a strong magnetic barrier .",
    "the particle acceleration is driven by electromagnetic fields induced from charge separation between protons and electrons dragged from the ambient medium by the barrier .",
    "electrons can acquire a substantial fraction of the proton kinetic energy to produce synchrotron emission .",
    "more recently , a new but related acceleration mechanism has been proposed by  @xcite involving a hot magnetized collisionless plasma , confined to a finite slab ( rather than the infinite slab of  @xcite ) and suddenly released into a vacuum .",
    "the surface gradient of the magnetic field generates a strong diamagnetic current which shields the interior and confines the field to the expanding plasma , but the initial magnetic slab breaks into multiple pulses .",
    "an electric field of order @xmath2 is associated with the magnetic field of each pulse .",
    "particles are trapped in the pulse surface layer and accelerated to higher and higher energies via the ponderomotive force of the magnetic pressure gradient .",
    "this mechanism has been termed the diamagnetic relativistic pulse accelerator ( drpa ) by  @xcite .",
    "the wind set - up  @xcite can be thought of as a special case of a magneto - acoustic pulse in the fnite pulse model  @xcite for which the pulse has an infinite width in the propagation direction .",
    "we will demonstrate that the pulse width is particularly important for the interaction with the ambient medium .",
    "depending on whether the width is larger or smaller than the particle gyro - radii there are three general possibilities : ( _ i ) _ the external matter crosses the pulse and is lost to the interior of the expanding plasma , ( _ ii ) _ the external particles get trapped and accelerated inside the pulse or ( _ iii ) _ the external particles are reflected into the oncoming material .",
    "( in the relativistic regime , we will see that ( _ ii ) _ and ( _ iii ) _ are largely indistinguishable . ) for realistic pulses , the rise of the magnetic field strength at the leading edge of the leading pulse will be smoother than the abrupt jump assumed in  @xcite which makes a significant difference .",
    "complementarily , although an ambient medium was included in  @xcite its effect not yet been thoroughly studied in detail . that is a goal of this work .",
    "in addition to investigating the interaction between the pulse and the ambient medium , we will also study the spectrum of the both the internal and external particles .",
    "while many of the particles initially inside the pulse remain trapped , they get accelerated to high energies .",
    "this fast population of electrons will emit synchrotron radiation .",
    "the interaction of the pulse with the ambient medium can deliver a second delayed contribution to the emission : in cases where the external material gets trapped and accelerated in the pulse , ( case _ ( ii ) _ above ) , it is expected that these captured electrons also radiate synchrotron emission . this emission can be delayed with respect to the primary prompt emission if the density of the ambient medium is low compared to the density of the internal matter : a significant time is then needed for electrons to pile up to densities that produce observable radiation .",
    "this secondary emission can either blend in with the prompt emission and determine the late evolution thereofore can be seperated in time and form a completely distinct part of the systems radiation emission .",
    "we tackle the problem of magnetic pulse - ambient medium interaction with fully relativistic pic simulations .",
    "the magnetic pulse width , shape and strength are not assumed , but are generated self - consistently from the driving event , namely the sudden expansion of the strongly magnetized plasma . unlike previous simulations , we use the real electron proton mass ratio of @xmath3 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in sec .",

    "finally , the electron spikes represent population inversions in the energy spectrum and one might expect them to act as sources of free energy for plasma instabilities , e.g. maser - like instabilities .",

    "we conclude this section by summarizing the important limitations of our radiation calculations .",
    "we have used the particle distribution function from the simulations that we then use a posteriori to calculate the emission spectra .",
    "the particle distribution function can be directly inferred from the pic calculations because , as stated earlier , the charge to mass ratio of superparticles and particles are the same .",
    "although our calculated spectral break should survive , the actual normalization of the radiation flux can not be accurately determined because the number of photons does depend on the actual particle number .",
    "another key issue is that radiation reaction terms are not included in our present work .",
    "a complete treatment of particle acceleration and radiation should dynamically couple the radiation reaction to the particles and fields each time step .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present work and has been addressed by noguchi et al .",
    "the effect seems to be to lower the total energy in the radiation .",
    "however , all existing simulations presently do not last long enough to know exactly how these results extend to the much longer time scales needed for direct application to astrophysical sources . that remains for future work .",
    "as discussed above , if the pulse width exceeds the proton gyro radius , both , protons and electrons are reflected .",
    "this is the case of  @xcite .",
    "if the pulse width is smaller than the proton gyro radius , a critical value of the initial internal plasma @xmath193 divides the parameter space into two regions : one in which external electrons are trapped by the pulse and one in which the external electrons pass through .",
    "the critical value of @xmath193 depends on the temperature of the internal plasma but not its density .",
    "the simulation parameters are such that the external protons always pass through the pulse unimpeded . that electrons can be trapped but protons are always transmitted , is important in determining the deceleration rate of the pulses .",
    "the pulses can act as filters that accumulate the ambient electrons while allowing the ambient protons to pass through .",
    "such filtering pulses would then decelerate more slowly than standard `` snow plow '' hydrodynamic outflows in astrophysics that accumulate both electrons and protons .",
    "the average magnetic field in the pulse can be described as a luminosity , i.e. @xmath194 . balancing the mechanical or electromagnetic outflow luminosity with the inertia of the ambient matter gives @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the density of the piled - up ambient medium in the lab frame , @xmath197 is the constituent particle mass , @xmath198 is the flow lorentz factor of the pulse and @xmath199 is the distance from the source .",
    "this yields @xmath200 if @xmath197 of the piled - up material is reduced by @xmath201 , the distance the pulse of a given @xmath198 propagates into the ambient medium is increased by a factor of @xmath202 .      how long the electron filtering is maintained depends on how long it takes for the electric field induced by the resulting charge separation to be strong enough to capture the protons .    in the pulse frame , the equation of motion for a single proton in the electric field behind the pulse",
    "is given by @xmath203 for @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the width of the electron layer , @xmath206 is the distance of the test - proton behind the pulse , @xmath207 is the electron density accumulated in the pulse and @xmath208 is the ambient proton number density .",
    "the second term on the right of the expression for @xmath209 is due to charge screening by the ambient protons having crossed the pulse unperturbed and filling the downstream region uniformly at a number density @xmath208 .",
    "the retarded time appears in the contribution to @xmath209 from the electrons in the pulse because its accumulation of electrons takes a time @xmath210 to propagate to the proton , where @xmath206 is measured from the pulse .",
    "using the fact that the total excess electron density at the pulse must equal the proton density left behind @xmath211 .    if we define @xmath212 as the time at which the given proton crosses the pulse , so @xmath213 .",
    "we now assume that @xmath214 for the regime of our calculation .",
    "then the appearance of the retarded time above implies that the electro - static field at the position of the proton at time @xmath215 is determined by the electron charge density @xmath216 .",
    "equation  ( [ 26 ] ) becomes @xmath217 while @xmath218 can change significantly , @xmath219 remains close to @xmath18 .",
    "we therefore invoke @xmath220 and assume a constant @xmath221 for the present calculation . inserting this expression into ( [ 27 ] ) yields",

    "the physical solution ( @xmath226 ) is given by @xmath227 to use this result in comparing time scales for the evolution of @xmath218 with models without proton leakage , we must transform this time scale back to the lab frame . since we consider the time for @xmath198 to fall only by a factor of 2 , in the lab frame , @xmath228 and @xmath229 , so that @xmath230    that @xmath231 is important .",
    "this implies that proton drag does not signficantly reduce the time scale for the relativistic electron dominated pulse to slow down compared to the case in which the protons are ignored . even at the low limit that is given by @xmath232",
    ", the drag exerted on the pulse is only produced by a fraction of the protons . in this case",
    "the pulse can be considered to propagate with no additional drag during the last 33% of the propagation : only protons that crossed the pulse at times up to @xmath233 can influence the pulse .",
    "in the following section we address several aspects of the drpa in the context of a pfdo model for grbs .    in order to make observable predictions , we have to extrapolate our simulation results to times beyond the reach of the simulations .",
    "such extensions bear a number of pitfalls but presently offer the only way to connect the early time micro physics with the observations in the absence of long duration simulations .",

    "before observed prompt grb time scales demand them .",

    "remarkably , the photon power law indices obtained from our simulations , @xmath241 at low and @xmath242 at high energies , are in excellent agreement with those observed  @xcite .",
    "that being said , the actual power - law break energy can not be determined from our simulations since the actual photon spectra of observed grbs are at much higher energies than reached during the duration of our simulations .",

    "in addition to the internal accelerated electrons which are responsible for the prompt gamma - ray emission , the external electrons trapped from the ambient medium would radiate in a later phase . to estimate the onset of their observable contribution",
    ", we must estimate the time evolution of their density increase in the surface layer upstream of the pulse .",
    "we assume that this layer is thin compared to the pulse travel distance ( thin - shell approximation ) . in a layer of thickness @xmath246 , where @xmath247 is the initial pulse size , the density increase after a time @xmath215 is then @xmath248 this is valid for spherical expansion , but since the actual situation corresponds to a spherical expansion in a beam of very small opening angle , the slab geometry of our simulations offers an acceptable correspondence . taking @xmath249 and extending this to a time of @xmath250",
    "yields a density increase by a factor @xmath251 . assuming an initial external plasma density @xmath252 , corresponding to a typical ism , @xmath253 at this time .",
    "the choice of @xmath254 corresponds to observations in our simulations .",
    "increasing its value will decrease the density growth , resulting in a further delay of the emission with respect to the prompt grb emission . also depending on @xmath255 and the pulse velocity ,",
    "this radiation could threfore produce a second peak in the prompt emission or coincide with the grb afterglow  @xcite .",
    "the present work focuses on the propagation of a poynting flux dominated relativistic plasma outflow ( slab ) with an ambient medium .",
    "we find that the magnetic outflow breaks up into sub - pulses , consistent with that of the drpa mechanism  @xcite .",
    "we study the interaction of the leading pulse with the ambient medium .",
    "the interaction can now be categorized into three regimes : ( a ) all external particles are reflected ( nearly equivalent to `` trapped '' for relativistic propagation ) by the pulse , ( b ) all external particles are transmitted , and ( c ) electrons are reflected but not ions .    in all three regimes ,",
    "the internal particles originating from within the initial expanding plasma ( electrons and positrons ) are always trapped and accelerated .",
    "external leptons are only trapped in regimes ( a ) and ( c ) . regime ( a ) , which is realized when the pulse width is much larger than the proton gyro - radius , is equivalent to the case discussed in the literature by  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the focus of the present work is on regime ( c ) , which gives rise to a new population of energetic electrons .    for regime ( c ) the pulse acts as a semi - permeable membrane that filters out electrons from the ambient medium whilst allowing the transmission of ions .",
    "the different behavior of ions and electrons leads to an important difference in the drag force excerted on the pulse by the piled up matter : instead of being immediately felt , the inertia of the protons acts on the pulse with a delay via electrostatic interaction between piled up electrons and transmitted protons . in terms of the propagation time @xmath256 of the pulse , only protons that have crossed the pulse at times up to @xmath233 can influence the pulse .",
    "in addition to these findings , we have analyzed the particle energy distributions , acceleration rates and synchrotron spectra of the external and internal electrons .",
    "we were able to extend the simulation times to @xmath257 , allowing the study of significantly longer term evolution than in previous work .",
    "we find :    @xmath258 external electrons pile up in a thin shell at the leading flank of the pulse and are accelerated at a rate similar to that of the internal electrons . a fractionally signficant amount of radiation ( compared to that from internal electrons ) from these piled - up external electrons would occur late stage of the pulse evolution , only when their density has grown large enough . @xmath258 the total electron / positron energy quasi - oscillates in exchange with the electromagnetic field energy .",
    "however , the lorentz factor of the pulse continues to grow at the analytically predicted rate throughout the timespan covered by our simulations , as electrons are leaked .",
    "@xmath258 the internal particles develop a double power - law energy spectrum with a clearly defined break energy .",
    "the resulting synchrotron photon spectrum is in remarkable agreement with observations of grbs  @xcite , though the small time - scales of our simulations prevent us from presently uncovering any additional physics that might modify this spectrum at the later times needed to realistically compare with actual grb observations , this accelerator will saturate at times of order @xmath259 due to increasing energy loss via synchrotron emission .",
    "the characteristic particle lorentz factor of a particle whose radiation loss balances its acceleration lies at @xmath260 . in the context of grbs",
    "this energy lies within an order of magnitude of the characteristic photon energy of @xmath261 .",
    "@xmath258 while the initial configuration is strongly magnetically dominated , at late times in the simulations , at least 1/2 of the energy is convered into accelerated electrons .",
    "while the simulations here represent the physics occurring only at the very front of what would be a much larger scale extended magnetic tower propagating into an ambient medium , the results show that the conversion at the front of the tower is extremely efficient , even without relativistic shocks .",
    "it is now essential to extend the simulations to later times that allow the analysis and comparison of prompt and delayed emission in the course of the drpa .",
    "the goal is to directly connect the initial expansion with the emission of prompt radiation at later times .",
    "our present extrapolations can then be tested .",
    "one way to reduce the computational effort is to use a moving window that allows to follow the pulse and simulate only its closer environment .",
