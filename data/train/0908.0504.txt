    "is the lack of a characteristic size , length or frequency for an observable @xmath0 under scrutiny .",
    "this fact usually leads to a power law distribution @xmath1 , valid in most of the domain of definition of @xmath0 , @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "special attention deserves the class of universality defined by @xmath4 , which corresponds to the so - called zipf s law in the cumulative distribution or the rank - size distribution  @xcite .",
    "recently , maillart et al .",
    "@xcite have found that links distributions follow zipf s law as a consequence of stochastic proportional growth . in its simplest formulation",
    "such kind of growth assumes that an element of the system becomes enlarged proportionally to its size @xmath0 , being governed by a wiener process .",
    "the class @xmath4 emerges from the condition of stationarity , i.e. , when the system reaches a dynamic equilibrium  @xcite",
    ". we will as well propose to consider the case @xmath5 as representative of a second class of universality , since the ensuing behavior , empirically found by costa filho et al .",
    "@xcite with regards to the vote - distribution in brazilian electoral results , emerges as the result of multiplicative processes in complex networks @xcite . in this paper",
    "we attempt to formulate a thermodynamic treatment common to these systems .",
    "our efforts are based on the minimization with appropriate constraints of fisher s information measure ( fim ) , abbreviated as the mfi approach .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that mfi leads to a ( real ) schreodinger - like equation whose `` potential '' function is given by the constraints employed to constrain the variational process .",
    "the interplay between constraints and associated lagrange multipliers turns our to be legendre - invariant @xcite and leads to all known thermodynamic relations .",
    "such result constitutes the essential ingredient of our considerations here .",
    "we will first consider the mfi treatment of the ideal gas ( seccion 3 ) , not given elsewhere as far as we are aware of , since it is indispensable to deal with it in order to fully understand the methodology employed for scale - free systems , which is tackled in section 4 .",
    "applicatioms are discussed in section 5 and some conclusiones drawn in section 6 .",
    "we begin our considerations in section 2 with a brief fisher s sketch .",
    "the fisher information measure @xmath6 for a system described by a set of coordinates @xmath7 and physical parameters @xmath8 , has the form  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the density distribution in a configuration space ( @xmath7 ) of volume @xmath11 conditioned by the physical parameters collectively represented by the variable @xmath8 .",

    "as shown in  @xcite , the thermal - equilibrium state of the system can be determined by minimizing @xmath6 subject to adequate prior conditions ( mfi ) , like the normalization of @xmath17 or by any constraint on the mean value of an observable @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the mfi is then cast as a variation problem of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 are appropriate lagrange multipliers .",
    "as a didactic introductory example , not discussed in @xcite , we will here rederive , _ via mfi _ ( something original as far as we know ) , the density distribution , in configuration space , of the ( translational invariant ) ideal gas ( ig )  @xcite , that describes non - interacting classical particles of mass @xmath21 with coordinates @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "the translational invariance is described by the translational family of distributions @xmath24 whose form does not change under the transformations @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that these coordinates are canonical  @xcite and uncorrelated .",
    "this assumption is introduced into the information measure  ( [ fish ] ) setting @xmath13 , where @xmath27 for space coordinates , @xmath28 for momentum coordinates .",
    "the density can obviously be factorized in the fashion @xmath29 , and then  @xcite it follows from the additivity of the information measure that @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath31 is the dimensionality we have @xmath32    in extremizing fim we constrain the normalization of @xmath33 and @xmath34 to the total number of particles @xmath35 and to @xmath36 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath37 in addition , we penalize infinite values for the particle momentum with a constraint on the variance of @xmath34 to a given empirically obtained value , namely , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mean value of @xmath40 . for each degree of freedom",

    "we work under the hypothesis that @xmath80 and @xmath81 are canonically conjugated  @xcite and uncorrelated .",
    "this assumption immediately leads to proportional growth since @xmath82 for constant @xmath81 this equation yields an exponential growth @xmath83 , which represents uniform linear motion in @xmath80 , that is , @xmath84 , with @xmath85  .",

    "the situation in which @xmath157 as @xmath108 will be referred to herefrom as the _ bulk regime_. now , in a recent communication @xcite , we show that zipf s law ( @xmath4 in  ( [ eq1 ] ) with a slope of @xmath158 in the rank - plot ) can be derived from the extremization of fisher s information with _ no _ constraints . in the thermodynamic context studied here",
    ", the absence of normalization can be understood as the inability of the system to reach the thermodynamic limit , i.e. @xmath159 as @xmath108 . in this case",
    "the system can not follow ( [ cold ] ) .",
    "zipf s law emerges as this behaviour of the density in what we will accordingly denominate the _ zipf regime _ ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "we digress on the conditions for both regimes in the example discussed below .",
    "we have studied the system formed by all physics journals  @xcite ( @xmath160 ) using their total number of cites as coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "if a journal receives more cites due to its popularity , it becomes even more popular and therefore it will receive more cites . under such conditions proportional growth and scale invariance are expected . since we consider _ all sub - fields _ of physics , correlation effects are much lower than they would be should we only consider journals pertaining to an specific sub - field .",
    "accordingly , the non - interacting approximation seems to be realistic in this instance . in figure  3",
    "we depict the rank - plot of the number of citations in physic journals , and find a slope approaching @xmath158 for the most - cited journals in the logarithmic representation ( figure  3a ) and an slope in the vicinity of r @xmath161 for the less - cited journals ( figure  3b ) .",

    "we exhibit in figure  4 the raw empirical data as compared with the distribution obtained from the transformation @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) , where @xmath167 .",
    "the main part of the density distribution reaches the bulk density obeying  ( [ cold ] ) , whereas zipf s law emerges at the edges , which could be understood as constituting the _ surface _ of the system , since they explain how the density ( exponentially ) falls from its bulk - value to zero in @xmath80-space when the system is exposed to an infinitely empty volume .",
    "this effect is clearly visible in figure  5 , where the empirical density distribution @xmath168 in @xmath80-space is compared with the `` fitted '' density @xmath169 where @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "these findings lead us to conclude that the system consisting of physics journals , when sorted by total number of citations , is a perfect example of a finite scale - free ideal gas at equilibrium .     where @xmath0 is the number of cites.[fig4 ] ]    -space of the total number of cites of physics journals , compared with  ( [ fit ] ) .",
    "the bulk regime and the zipf regime at the edges is clearly visible .",
    "[ fig5 ] ]      the dynamics of the system under scrutiny here can be microscopically described as a stochastic process using  ( [ dyn ] ) together with the density distribution  ( [ hw ] ) . treating @xmath81 as a random variable , the pertinent stochastic equation of motion",
    "is written in the guise of a geometrical brownian motion , i.e. ,  @xcite @xmath174 where @xmath175 represents a wiener process . in the @xmath80-space",
    ", this equation reads @xmath176 and is known to describe the celebrated brownian motion  ( [ eqd ] ) , which exactly describes the dynamical condition found empirically in  @xcite and also the ( stochastic ) proportional growth model used in  @xcite to obtain zipf s law .",
    "we thus dare to suggest that we are dealing here with a sort of `` equivalent '' of a molecular dynamics simulation for gases / liquids  @xcite .",
    "indeed , ( [ eqd2 ] ) describes @xmath35 brownian walkers moving in a fixed volume @xmath11 with uniform density in @xmath80-space , a model used in the literature to describe the ideal gas @xcite .",
    "this scenario can also be reproduced by our free - scale ideal gas merely by choosing to represent the system with the coordinates @xmath177 . in figure  1a",
    "we show the rank - plot for @xmath0 of a system of @xmath178 geometrical brownian walkers with @xmath154 and @xmath156 in a volume @xmath146 , with d @xmath179 in reduced units , which approximately describes the distribution of the population of the province of huelva .",
    "we also show in figure  2 the rankplot of @xmath81 of the same random walkers , compared with the empirical data .",
    "our present considerations derive from the fact that , as shown in @xcite , thermodynamics can be reformulated in terms of the minimization with appropriate constraints of fisher s information .",
    "we have applied such reformulation in order to discuss the thermodynamics of scale - free systems and derived the density distribution in configuration space and the entropic expression for the equilibrium state of what we call sfig : the scale - free ideal gas ( in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "we have encountered convincing empirical evidences of the sfig actual existence in sociological scenarios .",
    "thus , we have dealt with city populations , electoral results and citations in physics journals .",
    "in such a context it is seen that zipf s law emerges naturally as the equilibrium density of the non - interacting system when the volume grows without bounds , a situation that we call the zipf regime . using empirical data we have revealed that this regime can be understood as a density - decay at the `` surface '' separating the bulk from an empty and very large volume .",
    "finally , we have shown with a simulation of city - populations that geometrical brownian motion can describe such systems at a microscopic level .",
