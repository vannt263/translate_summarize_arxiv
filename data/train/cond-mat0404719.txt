    "although this model problem is of much relevance in understanding the mechanical behavior of artificial adhesives , naturally occurring adhesive surfaces in animals and insects in particular present complex structural morphologies to alter the physics of adhesion ( scherge and gorb 2001 ) . to explore the mechanisms of crack initiation and propagation on these textured interfaces , we study the initiation propagation of cracks on model adhesive layers which are patterned by sharp cuts and discontinuities using a simple cantilever plate peeling experiment ( see fig .

    "we use thin films of polydimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) as a model adhesive film in our experiments .",
    "these crosslinked elastomeric films of shear modulii between 0.2 - 3.1 mpa are prepared by following the procedure described in ghatak and chaudhury 2003 .",
    "jkr ( johnson , kendall and roberts , 1971 ) contact mechanics experiments of the networks indicate that they are purely elastic and exhibit no hysteresis .",
    "the film is strongly adhered to a rigid substrate which is attached to the stage of a microbalance .",

    "we then bring the flexible plate in complete contact with the elastic film and keep it so for thirty minutes before quasi - statically lifting the plate at a distance away from the edge ( fig .",

    "initially the load increases linearly with the displacement ( @xmath2 ) of the plate .",
    "as the displacement is increased beyond a threshold , the moment increases sub - linearly ; this process is accompanied by the nucleation of a series of cavitation bubbles ( fig . [",

    "although all the bubbles do not all nucleate at the same time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]c - d ) as @xmath2 is increased , they are periodically spaced with a well - defined separation wavelength @xmath8 .",
    "once this array of bubbles is established behind the edge , a further increase in @xmath2 causes the existing bubbles to grow and coalesce ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]e - f ) until they eventually reach the edge of the adhesive film ( fig .",

    "cavitation does not occur randomly as thought previously ( gent _ et al .",

    "[ fig : fig4]b ) multiple crack arrest and initiation events lead to a high peeling moment ( solid line ) which remains constant and does not show the stick - slip like characteristics for incisions that are widely separated . as we will see later",
    ", the disappearance of the stick - slip behaviour is associated with the fact that the characteristic length scale of the texture is smaller than a critical threshold .",
    "in such a situation , since the peeling moment is much higher than that on a smooth adhesive film , we see that the fracture toughness of the interface is also significantly enhanced by texturing , quite contrary to normal intuition .",

    "[ fig : fig5]b we plot the peeling moment as a function of displacement @xmath2 for various @xmath51 and see that changes in @xmath51 affect the crack initiation moment more significantly for thick films than for thin ones .",
    "as @xmath53 the critical peeling moment becomes smaller and smaller , consistent with the fact that when @xmath54 there is no edge at all so that there is no barrier for crack initiation , and suggests that @xmath51 is a measure of crack blunting .",
    "further experiments are needed to quantify this effect and will be subject of future study .",
    "we now turn to an approximate theory to rationalize our experimental findings . assuming that the adhesive film is incompressible , linearly elastic and loaded in plane strain , the equations of equilibrium are @xmath55 here and elsewhere @xmath56",
    ", @xmath57 is the pressure in the elastic film , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the components of displacement field in the @xmath60 and @xmath61 directions ( fig .",
    "1 a ) , and @xmath62 is the shear modulus of the adhesive .",
    "the pressure itself is determined by the constraint of incompressibility , which in its linearized form can be written as @xmath63 with the origin of coordinate system at the corner of the incision in the film , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a , the corresponding boundary conditions ( b.c . )",

    "are much larger than horizontal gradients , so that we may use the lubrication approximation ( batchelor , 1967 ) .",
    "then @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 and the equations of equilibrium ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) simplify to @xmath72 integrating ( [ eq : eq7]-[eq : eq6 ] ) yields @xmath73 substituting ( [ disp ] ) into the depth - integrated continuity equation ( [ eq : eq5 ] ) and linearizing the result leads to an equation for the vertical displacement of the cover plate in the region @xmath74 where it is attached to the adhesive film @xmath75 in the region @xmath76 where the film is not in contact with the plate , the displacement of the cover plate satisfies @xmath77 since the film must be flat far away from the contact line @xmath78 continuity of the displacement , slope , bending moment , vertical shear force and the pressure at the contact line imply that @xmath79 finally , at @xmath80 , where the flexible plate is freely pivoted while being lifted vertically by an amount @xmath2 , the boundary conditions are @xmath81 we pause briefly to consider the assumptions inherent in our approach .",
    "lubrication theory clearly must break down over a length scale of order @xmath82 from the edge .",
    "however , if we consider variations over scales much larger than @xmath83 , these edge effects can be safely ignored . as we shall see later , this is indeed the case .",
    "the edge of the incision where the plate first loses contact with the elastic film acts to pin the contact line .",
    "this allows us to specify the deflection of the plate @xmath2 and the distance of the contact line from the point of application of the force @xmath1 independently .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of a flexible plate in contact with a smooth elastic film , where it is not possible to specify both @xmath1 and @xmath2 since there is a relation between them in terms of the work of adhesion .    solving ( [ eq : eq11 ] ) subject to ( [ eq : eq12]-[eq : eq14 ] ) for the interfacial displacement @xmath84 leads to @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are two characteristic lengths that arise naturally in the problem .",
    "the scale @xmath88 determines the lateral extent of the film over which the peeling deformation is felt ; on scales larger than @xmath88 ( [ eq : eq16 ] ) shows that the interface displacement decays exponentially . for typical experimental parameter values , @xmath89 , so that crack tip and edge effects are relatively small . using ( [ eq : eq11 ] ) we can now determine the normal traction on the surface of the film which , in the lubrication approximation , is given by @xmath90 . for long wavelength deformations",
    "@xmath91 so that @xmath92 where @xmath93 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] we show the variation of the vertical displacement @xmath94 and the normal traction @xmath95 .",
    "we note that both the displacement and the traction are oscillatory with exponentially decaying amplitudes ; in particular the normal traction has a negative maximum at a distance @xmath6 from the edge , given by @xmath96 where the pressure @xmath97 this large tensile traction at some distance behind the contact line rationalizes our observations of cavitation bubbles .",
    "however the characteristic periodicity of the bubbles in the transverse direction ( parallel to the contact line ) with a wavelength @xmath98 ( ghatak and chaudhury , 2003 ) requires a three - dimensional stability analysis of the planar solution and is beyond the scope of the current study . here",
    "the role of the incisions is to pin the contact line and prevent the crack from being initiated until a threshold stress is reached , thus raising the effective toughness of the interface .",
    "our experimental observations of the dimensionless cavitation bubble nucleation distance @xmath99 shown in fig .",
    "3 are qualitatively consistent with ( [ eq : eq20 ] ) although quantitatively there is a discrepancy of about @xmath100",
    ". this could be due to the use of the particular boundary condition that the pressure is continuous at the contact line @xmath67 .",
    "if we replace this by a different boundary condition @xmath101 , and calculate @xmath102 by minimizing the total energy of the system , we get @xmath103 , in accordance with our experimental measurements .",
    "in fact , the actual condition at the contact line is determined by the details of the microscopic interaction between the two surfaces and is probably somewhat intermediate between these two cases .    the exponentially decaying stress profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) also explains why the crack gets arrested before it reaches the an incision .",
    "since the normal traction vanishes at the incision , the next crack is initiated via bubble nucleation and coalescence on the other side of the incision and the whole scenario repeats itself .",
    "when the distance between incisions becomes of the order of or less than the characteristic stress decay length @xmath104 the crack feels the effect of incisions continuously , and the intermittent behavior of the peeling moment is replaced by a much higher constant value for a finely textured surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) ) .    to obtain the stress associated with bubble nucleation",
    ", we rearrange equation ( [ eq : eq21 ] ) so that @xmath105 here @xmath106 is the critical stress associated with bubble nucleation , which can be determined by comparing ( [ eq : eq22 ] ) with our experimental data and yields @xmath107 n / m@xmath108 . for comparison , with a hamaker constant @xmath109 j , a separation distance @xmath110  the van der waals pressure , @xmath111 n / m@xmath108 .",
    "the experimentally obtained low value of @xmath106 suggests that the two surfaces do not remain in perfect contact and are separated by an average distance of @xmath112 possibly due to the intrinsic roughness of the adhesive films .",
    "however , our experiments even with films of very low root - mean - square roughness ( @xmath113  ) results in a low critical stress ( @xmath114 n / m@xmath108 ) , signifying that other factors may be responsible as well .     and",
    "the dimensionless displacement @xmath115 at the film interface as a function of dimensionless distance @xmath116 from the edge are oscillatory exponentials",
    ". the dimensionless maximum tensile stress @xmath117 occurs at a dimensionless distance @xmath99 behind the incision.,height=170 ]",
    "in this note , we have demonstrated the qualitative difference between crack initiation and crack propagation in the context of peeling a flexible plate from a thin textured adhesive film .",
    "the origin of this difference may be ascribed to the formation of cavitation bubbles behind the contact line which increases the load required for peeling by creating a convoluted crack front .",
    "a different way of enhancing the load for crack initiation is to use films with oblique incisions , and leads to effective way of blunting or sharpening the crack tip .",
    "a simple theory allows us to explain these observations qualitatively and quantitatively , and leads to a design criterion for enhancing the interfacial fracture toughness of a flexible plate in contact with an adhesive film : the pattern has to be microstructured on a length scale smaller than or equal to the stress decay length @xmath118 .",
    "we finally return to our motivation of biological attachment devices ( scherge _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) which show a variety of textured contact surfaces .",
    "our experiments on model patterned systems suggest that the enhanced fracture toughness in these biological settings is a rather subtle effect owing to the difference between crack initiation and propagation on a patterned surface .",
    "multiple crack arrest and initiation on these surfaces results in the dissipation of the elastic energy in much the same way as for fracture of soft elastomers ( lake and thomas 1967 ) : even if all the polymers in the film are strained , when a bond ruptures the broken parts relax under zero load leading to dissipation of energy .",
    "nature seems to have taken advantage of these principles in designing the attachment pads of insects and other sticky surfaces for millenia , and so all that remains is for us to understand and mimic her infinite variety ."
