    "the fact that strong electric field creates particle - antiparticle pairs from the vacuum is predicted in the framework of quantum electrodynamics several decades ago @xcite .",
    "this effect , which is known as the schwinger effect , has a simple interpretation in the famous dirac s hole theory - e.g. , in the presence of an electric field , virtual particles can tunnel out of the dirac sea producing particle - hole pairs .",
    "since the publication of the seminal paper by schwinger , a great interest is devoted to the problem of particle creation from vacuum by strong fields .",
    "theoretically , the importance of this effect comes from its nonperturbative nature and its relation with other problems such as the black hole radiation and the dynamical casimir effect .",
    "it is widely known , today , that the particle creation effects have many important applications from heavy nucleus to black hole physics @xcite .    in experimental physics ,",
    "the strong field pair production has attracted much attention , especially , in recent years .",
    "the field strength required to observe produced pairs is of order of the critical value @xmath0 ( for electron pairs ) , which seems to be beyond the current technological capabilities .",
    "however , in recent years , explicit experimental realizations have been proposed to see the schwinger effect for the first time @xcite .",
    "the basic principle of these experiments is the enhancement of the schwinger mechanism by the combination of a strong slow pulsed laser with a weak fast pulsed laser .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the faster pulse gives a multi - photon contribution , which reduces the barrier through which the particle tunnels and leads to an exponential enhancement .",
    "then the schwinger effect could be observed in the near future .",
    "quantitatively , in @xmath1 dimensional space - time , the number of created particles per unit of time per unit of volume is @xcite @xmath2 the important characteristic of this formula is the exponential @xmath3 , which explains the nonperturbative nature of the phenomenon and the existence of the critical value from which the effect becomes appreciable .",
    "since this exponential is independent of the space - time dimension , the analysis of the effect seems to be the same in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "one expects , also , to obtain a similar exponential with a strong slow pulsed laser because , in such a case , the period of the field is very large compared to the typical time of the particle creation .    on the other hand , as is mentioned in @xcite , there are many indications that lead us to believe on the existence of a minimal length scale .",
    "this minimal length scale , which is expected to be smaller than the electroweak scale @xcite , arises in many theories of quantum gravity such as string theory @xcite , loop quantum gravity @xcite , black hole physics @xcite and in non - commutative field theories @xcite .",
    "if such a minimal length exists in nature , it would be of great interest to see how it influences the physical measurements .",
    "this explains why various physical problems are reconsidered by taking into account the minimal length .",
    "as example , we cite the harmonic oscillator @xcite , the hydrogen atom @xcite , the inverse square potential @xcite , the dirac oscillator @xcite , and the resonant scattering by a potential barrier @xcite . elsewhere , the influence of the minimal length on the casimir effect has been communicated in several works @xcite .",
    "we note , also , that the quantum corrections to the black hole thermodynamics to all orders in the planck length from a generalized uncertainty principle are calculated in @xcite .",
    "this kind of studies is motivated by the possibility it offers to put the existence of a minimal length into evidence and the regularization of certain problems in physics ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , as is mentioned in @xcite , since the presence of a minimal length is common to many theories , phenomena such as the hawking effect and the particle creation , should be critically reviewed .    in this paper",
    "we propose to study the phenomenon of particle creation from vacuum by an electric field in the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional minkowski space - time with a nonzero minimal length . as in the case of the noncommutative space - time @xcite",
    ", we expect that the introduction of a minimal length on the theory of fields could have important consequences on the particle creation .",
    "in addition , since the schwinger effect is expected to be observed in the near future , the minimal length could find an experimental justification through this observation or at least find an important upper bound .",
    "we consider in this paper the canonical method based on bogoliubov transformation connecting the `` in '' with the `` out '' states . in the first stage , we give a short reminder about the particles creation problem and its derivation from the wave functions both in position representation or in momentum one .",
    "then , we consider a scalar particle interacting with an electric field in the presence of a minimal length , where we give two sets of exact solutions for the corresponding klein gordon equation . in order to get the good definition of the `` in '' and the `` out '' states , we study the limit of zero minimal length .",
    "next , we calculate the pair creation probability and the mean number of created particles from the bogoliubov coefficients . finally , we calculate the number of created particles per unit of time per unit of length as soon as the imaginary part of the schwinger effective lagrangian .",
    "in order to derive the pair creation rate we have at our disposal several methods such as the method based on vacuum to vacuum transition amplitude and schwinger - like effective action @xcite , the hamiltonian diagonalization technique @xcite , the feynman path integral method @xcite as well as the semiclassical wkb approximation @xcite and the `` in '' and `` out '' states formalism @xcite that we shall use in this work .    the `` in '' and `` out '' states formalism has been much used in the theory of particle creation and vacuum instability in external fields .",
    "this formalism proved most fruitful in finding the probability to create a pair of particles and the mean number of created particles both in the presence of electromagnetic fields or in curved space - time where gravitational fields are present @xcite .",
    "however , the `` in '' and `` out '' states method is based on analytic expressions of the wave functions which is not , in general , possible .",
    "since the constant electric field is described by a linear potential , the corresponding klein gordon equation with minimal length admits exact and analytic solutions only in momentum representation .",
    "therefore , the classification of these solutions as `` in '' and `` out '' states is not straightforward .",
    "thus , before considering the creation of scalar particles in the presence of a minimal length , let us , first , recall briefly how to determine the `` in '' and `` out '' states in ordinary quantum field theory by the use of the momentum space . to our knowledge , there is no report , in literature , on the definition of these states in momentum space .",
    "it is obvious that the good definition of these states enables us to calculate the exact probability of particle creation as soon as the mean number of created particles with and without minimal length .      in position representation the `` in '' and `` out '' states are well - defined . here",

    "we consider the space - dependent gauge because it seems simpler in the presence of a minimal length .    as is known , in order to solve the equation ( [ 1 ] )",

    "for instance , by considering the probability amplitude@xmath29 and by taking into account that @xmath30 we obtain @xmath31 as a result , the probability to create a pair of particles with the energy @xmath11 from vacuum is given by @xmath32 using the property @xmath33 we obtain the well - known result@xmath34 this formulation enables us also to calculate the mean number of created particles and the vacuum persistence .",

    "it shows , however , that the bogoliubov coefficients can be obtained directly from the `` in '' and the `` out '' states expressed in momentum space",
    ". this will be very interesting in the presence of the minimal length where there is no exact and analytic solution in position space .",
    "before considering the effect of the minimal length on creation of scalar particles by an electric field , let us , first , give a short reminder about this novel concept .",
    "there are many considerations that suggest the existence of a minimal length .",
    "for example , in black hole physics @xcite , it is shown that the heisenberg uncertainty principle modifies to be @xmath54 where @xmath55 is very small positive parameter and @xmath56 .",
    "such a generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) leads to a nonzero minimal length given by @xmath57 in addition , since the relation ( [ eq : gup ] ) is invariant under the change @xmath58 , there would be a mixing between the ultraviolet and infrared behaviors of the field theories , which is called the uv / ir mixing .",
    "the derivation of this gup by quantum mechanical tools in the one dimensional space and its generalization to arbitrary dimensional case can be found in a series of papers by kempf and co - workers @xcite .",
    "it is shown in these papers how the quantum mechanics with gup can be formulated . here , we recall , briefly , that the gup in ( [ eq : gup ] ) can be reproduced by considering new operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 defined by @xmath61 where @xmath41 and @xmath62 are the usual operators of quantum mechanics fulfilling the commutation relation @xmath63   = i$ ] and @xmath64 is an injective function .",

    "it should be noted that the produced gup depends on the choice of the function @xmath69 .",

    "we find other choices that correspond to a minimal length and/or maximal momentum ( see for example @xcite ) .    from equations ( [ x ] ) , ( [ p ] ) , ( [ fp ] ) and ( [ cr1 ] )",

    "then , to see the effect of this minimal length on the particle creation , it is sufficient to consider equation ( [ cr1 ] ) . the use of a more general commutation relation risks leading to a nonsolvable problem and much mathematical difficulties .    in the next paragraph",
    "we solve the klein gordon equation in the presence of an electric field by taking into account the canonical commutation relation ( [ cr1 ] ) .      before solving the klein gordon equation with a minimal length and studying the creation of scalar particles ,",

    "for this reason , we have considered in the first stage the particle creation in ordinary quantum field theory where we have written the `` in '' and the `` out '' states in momentum representation . in the presence of a minimal length , we have distinguished the `` in '' from the `` out '' states by studying the limit @xmath103 .",
