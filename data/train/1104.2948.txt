    "recent cosmological observations have revealed significant gaps in our understanding of the physics of the universe .",
    "a set of measurements including the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation , the shape of the clustering power spectrum of galaxies , the brightness of distant supernovae and the projected scales of baryon acoustic oscillations have indicated the presence of a `` dark energy '' component which is propelling the cosmic expansion into a phase of acceleration ( for recent results see komatsu et al .",

    "2010 , guy et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the physical nature of dark energy is not yet understood .",
    "several explanations have been put forward including the presence of smoothly - distributed energy such as a cosmological constant or a quintessence scalar field , a large - scale modification to einstein s theory of general relativity , or the effects of spatially - varying curvature in an inhomogeneous universe .",
    "further observational data is required to distinguish clearly between the subtly - varying predictions of these very different physical models ( e.g. , linder 2005 , wang 2008 , wiltshire 2009 ) .",
    "one of the most important observational datasets for addressing this issue is the large - scale structure of the galaxy distribution .",
    "the clustering within this distribution arises through a process of gravitational instability which acts to amplify primordial matter fluctuations .",
    "the growth rate of this structure with time is a key discriminant between cosmological models ( e.g. , linder & jenkins 2003 , linder & cahn 2007 , nesseris & perivolaropoulos 2008 ) .",
    "two different physical dark energy scenarios with the same background cosmic expansion generally produce different growth rates of perturbations , hence growth measurements are able to discriminate between models that are degenerate under geometric tests ( davis et al .  2007 ,",
    "rubin et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the growth of cosmic structure is driven by the motion of matter , for which galaxies act as `` tracer particles '' .",
    "these flows imprint a clear observational signature in galaxy surveys , known as redshift - space distortions , because the galaxy redshift is generated by not only the background cosmic expansion but also the peculiar velocity tracing the bulk flow of matter ( kaiser 1987 , hamilton 1998 ) . as a consequence",
    "the 2-point statistics of the galaxy distribution are anisotropic on large scales , where the amplitude of the anisotropy is related to the velocity of the bulk flow and hence to the growth rate of structure .",
    "many previous galaxy surveys have measured this anisotropy employing either the galaxy correlation function or power spectrum . in the relatively local universe , exquisite studies at redshift @xmath9",
    "have been undertaken using data from the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; peacock et al .",
    "2001 , hawkins et al .",
    "2003 , percival et al .",
    "2004 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; tegmark et al .",
    "the sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample enabled these measurements to be extended to somewhat higher redshifts @xmath10 ( tegmark et al .",
    "2006 , cabre & gaztanaga 2009 , okumura et al .",
    "noisier results have been achieved at greater look - back times up to @xmath11 by surveys mapping significantly smaller cosmic volumes such as the 2df - sdss lrg and quasar survey ( 2slaq ; da angela et al .",
    "2008 ) and the vimos - vlt deep survey ( vvds ; guzzo et al .  2008 ) .",
    "the current observational challenge is to map the intermediate - redshift @xmath12 universe with surveys of comparable statistical power to 2dfgrs and sdss , so that accurate growth rate measurements can be extracted across the full ( hypothesized ) redshift range for which dark energy dominates the cosmic dynamics . in order to achieve this goal",
    "we have constructed the wigglez dark energy survey ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2010 ) , a new large - scale spectroscopic galaxy redshift survey , using the multi - object aaomega fibre spectrograph at the @xmath13 m australian astronomical telescope .",
    "the survey , which began in august 2006 , targets uv - selected star - forming emission - line galaxies in several different regions around the sky and at redshifts @xmath14 . by covering a total solid angle of @xmath15 deg@xmath16 the wigglez survey maps two orders of magnitude more cosmic volume in the @xmath17 universe than previous galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "this paper presents the current measurements of the growth rate of structure using the galaxy power spectrum of the survey .",
    "the dataset will also permit many other tests of the cosmological model via baryon acoustic oscillations , the alcock - pacyznski effect , higher - order clustering statistics and topological descriptors of the density field .",
    "the improving statistical accuracy with which redshift - space distortions may be measured by observational datasets requires that the theoretical modelling of the data also advances .",
    "recent reviews of this topic have been provided by percival & white ( 2009 ) and song & percival ( 2009 ) . in the linear clustering regime , in the large - scale limit",
    ", the theory is well - understood ( kaiser 1987 , hamilton 1998 ) .",
    "however , both simulations and observations have demonstrated that linear theory is a poor approximation across a wide range of quasi - linear scales encoding a great deal of clustering information ( e.g.  jennings et al .",
    "2011 , okumura et al .  2011 ) .",
    "the blind application of linear - theory modelling to current surveys would therefore result in a significant systematic error in the extraction of the growth rate and a potential mis - diagnosis of the physical nature of dark energy .",
    "various methodologies have been employed for extending the modelling of redshift - space distortions to quasi - linear and non - linear scales . the classical approach  the so - called `` streaming model '' ( e.g.  hatton & cole 1998 )  modulates the linear theory clustering with an empirical damping function characterized by a variable parameter , which is marginalized over when extracting the growth rate .",
    "this model has provided an acceptable statistical fit to many previous datasets , but the lack of a strong physical motivation for the empirical function could lead to systematic errors when the model is confronted by high - precision data .    in this paper",
    "we consider two alternatives .",
    "firstly , quasi - linear redshift - space distortions can be modelled by various physically - motivated perturbation theory schemes ( for recent reviews see nishimichi et al .",
    "2009 ; carlson , white & padmanabhan 2010 ) . given that the accuracy of some current perturbation techniques breaks down at a particular quasi - linear scale , leading to potentially large discrepancies at smaller scales , the range of validity of these models must be carefully considered .",
    "the second approach is to use numerical n - body simulations to produce fitting formulae for the density and velocity power spectra ( smith et al .",
    "2003 , jennings et al .",
    "2011 ) , which enables models to be established across a wider range of scales .",
    "the main concern of this approach is that these fitting formulae may only be valid for the subset of cosmologies and galaxy formation models in which they were derived ( an important point given the unknown nature of dark energy ) .",
    "a further significant issue in the modelling of redshift - space distortions in the galaxy distribution is the `` galaxy bias '' relation by which galaxies trace the matter overdensities that drive the velocities ( e.g. , cole & kaiser 1989 )",
    ". the typical assumption of a local , linear , deterministic bias , for which there is a good physical motivation on large scales ( scherrer & weinberg 1998 ) , may break down in the case of precise measurements of the clustering pattern on quasi - linear scales ( swanson et al .",
    "2008 ) , also potentially leading to systematic errors in growth rate fits . in this study",
    "we consider the introduction of stochasticity to the bias relation by varying the galaxy - mass cross - correlation ( dekel & lahav 1999 ) .",
    "we note that further studies of the wigglez dataset involving the bispectrum , 3-point correlation function , galaxy halo occupation distribution and comparison with numerical simulations will yield further constraints on the form of galaxy bias .",
    "the aim of this paper is to use the existing range of redshift - space distortion models and galaxy power spectra from the wigglez survey to derive measurements of the growth rate across the redshift range @xmath18 that are robust against modelling systematics .",
    "we assume throughout a cosmological model consistent with the analysis of the latest measurements of the cmb by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( komatsu et al .",
    "2009 ) : a flat universe described by general relativity with matter density @xmath19 , cosmological constant @xmath20 , baryon fraction @xmath21 , hubble parameter @xmath22 , primordial scalar index of fluctuations @xmath23 and total fluctuation amplitude @xmath24 .",
    "in addition to providing a good description of the temperature and polarization fluctuations in the cmb , this model yields a good fit to distance measurements from supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations ( guy et al .",
    "2010 , percival et al .",
    "in this paper we test if the same model also predicts the observed growth rate of structure .",
    "future studies will explore simultaneous fits to these datasets using different dark energy models .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in section [ secmeas ] we present the measurements of the various observational statistics quantifying the anisotropic power spectrum .",
    "section [ secmod ] summarizes the current theory of redshift - space distortions in fourier space and introduces in more detail the models we will fit to the data . in section [ secparfit ]",
    "we carry out the parameter fitting focussing on the growth rate and the galaxy - mass cross - correlation .",
    "section [ secpkmom ] presents an analysis of the moments of the power spectrum and extraction of the power spectrum of the velocity divergence field , and section [ secconc ] lists our conclusions .",
    "the wigglez dark energy survey at the australian astronomical telescope ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2010 ) is a large - scale galaxy redshift survey of bright emission - line galaxies mapping a cosmic volume of order 1 gpc@xmath25 over redshift @xmath14 .",
    "the survey , which began in august 2006 and is scheduled to finish in january 2011 , will obtain of order @xmath26 redshifts for uv - selected galaxies covering of order 1000 deg@xmath16 of equatorial sky , using the aaomega spectrograph ( sharp et al .",
    "the survey design is driven by the scientific goal of measuring baryon acoustic oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum at a significantly higher redshift than existing surveys .",
    "the target galaxy population is selected from uv imaging by the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) satellite , matched with optical data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and red cluster sequence survey ( rcs2 ; gilbank et al .",

    "we analyze a subset of the wigglez sample assembled up to the end of the 10a semester ( may 2010 ) .",
    "we include data from six survey regions  the 9-hr , 11-hr , 15-hr , 22-hr , 1-hr and 3-hr regions  in the redshift range @xmath0 , which together constitute a total sample of @xmath27 galaxies .",
    "figure [ figradec ] displays the distribution in right ascension and declination of the analyzed sample for the six survey regions , where the greyscale level corresponds to the relative redshift completeness .",
    "we divided the sample into four redshift slices of width @xmath28 in order to map the evolution of the growth rate with redshift .",
    "the effective redshifts at which the clustering pattern was measured in each of these slices ( evaluated using equation 44 of blake et al .",
    "2010 ) were @xmath29 .",
    "the numbers of galaxies analyzed in each redshift slice were @xmath30 .",
    "we estimated the two - dimensional galaxy power spectrum @xmath31 in four redshift slices for each of the six wigglez survey regions using the direct fourier methods introduced by feldman , kaiser & peacock ( 1994 ; fkp ) .",
    "our methodology is fully described in section 3.1 of blake et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ; we give a brief summary here .",
    "firstly we mapped the angle - redshift survey cone into a cuboid of co - moving co - ordinates using a fiducial flat @xmath2cdm cosmological model with matter density @xmath19 .",
    "we gridded the catalogue in cells using nearest grid point assignment ensuring that the nyquist frequencies in each direction were much higher than the fourier wavenumbers of interest ( we corrected the power spectrum measurement for the small bias introduced by this gridding using the method of jing 2005 ) .",
    "we then applied a fast fourier transform to the grid .",
    "the window function of each region was determined using the methods described by blake et al .",
    "( 2010 ) that model effects due to the survey boundaries , incompleteness in the parent uv and optical catalogues , incompleteness in the spectroscopic follow - up , systematic variations in the spectroscopic redshift completeness across the aaomega spectrograph , and variations of the galaxy redshift distribution with angular position .",
    "the fast fourier transform of the window function was then used to construct the final power spectrum estimator .",
    "the measurement was corrected for the small effect of redshift blunders using monte carlo survey simulations as described in section 3.2 of blake et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "since each wigglez survey region subtends a relatively small angle on the sky , of order 10 degrees , the flat - sky approximation is valid .",
    "we orient the @xmath32-axis of our fourier cuboid parallel to the line - of - sight at the angular centre of each region , and then represent each fourier mode by wavevectors parallel and perpendicular to the line - of - sight : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we can also then determine the values of the total wavenumber of each mode @xmath35 and the cosine of its angle to the line - of - sight , @xmath36 .",
    "we used two binning schemes for averaging the fourier modes @xmath37 : in bins of @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( of width @xmath40 mpc@xmath8 ) and in bins of @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( of width @xmath40 mpc@xmath8 and @xmath43 , respectively ) .",
    "we determined the covariance matrix of the power spectrum measurement in these binning schemes by implementing the sums in fourier space described by fkp ( see blake et al .",
    "2010 equations 20 - 22 ) .",
    "the angular size of each wigglez region implies that the effect of wide - angle distortions ( raccanelli , samushia & percival 2010 ) is not significant .",
    "we note that the fkp covariance matrix of the power spectrum only includes the contribution from the survey window function and neglects any covariance due to non - linear growth of structure or redshift - space effects .",
    "the full covariance matrix may be studied with the aid of a large ensemble of n - body simulations ( rimes & hamilton 2005 , takahashi et al .",
    "2011 ) , which we are preparing in conjunction with the final wigglez survey sample .",
    "the impact of using the full non - linear covariance matrix on growth - of - structure measurements has not yet been studied , although takahashi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) demonstrated that the effect on the accuracy of extraction of the baryon acoustic oscillations is very small .",
    "the power spectrum model must be convolved with the window function to be compared to the data . for reasons of computing speed we re - cast the convolution as a matrix multiplication @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 label a single bin in the two - dimensional set @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "we determined the convolution matrix @xmath49 by evaluating the full fourier convolution for a complete set of unit vectors .",
    "for example , to evaluate the @xmath50 row of matrix elements , corresponding to a bin @xmath51 , we defined the three - dimensional model in fourier space for the unit vector @xmath52 applied the full convolution transform ( equation 16 in blake et al .  2010 ) , and binned the resulting power spectrum amplitudes in the same @xmath48 bins .",
    "the vector of results defines the @xmath53 row of the matrix @xmath54 in equation [ eqconv ] . in summary , for each of the 24 sub - regions we obtain a data vector @xmath55 [ spanning @xmath47 or @xmath48 ] , a covariance matrix and a convolution matrix .",
    "figures [ figpkcomp ] and [ figpkmu ] respectively display two - dimensional power spectra @xmath57 and @xmath58 for each of the four redshift slices , obtained by stacking measurements across the six survey regions . for comparison we also plot in each case contours corresponding to the best - fitting non - linear empirical lorentzian redshift - space distortion model described below . in figure [ figpkcomp ]",
    "the non - circular nature of the measurements and models in fourier space encode the imprint of redshift - space distortions . the overall `` squeezing '' of the contours in the @xmath38 direction reflects the large - scale bulk flows .",
    "the apparent `` pinching '' of the models near the @xmath59 axis is due to the damping caused by the pairwise velocity dispersion discussed below in section [ secempmodel ] , the amplitude of which is seen to increase with decreasing redshift ( the pinching results from the relative variation with @xmath42 of the numerator and denominator of equation [ eqpkemp2 ] ) .",
    "figure [ figpkmu ] , which bins the clustering amplitude with the cosine of the angle to the line - of - sight @xmath42 , illustrates how the coherent velocity flows boost the power of radial ( @xmath60 ) modes relative to tangential ( @xmath61 ) modes for a given scale @xmath41 .",
    "in this section we describe a range of 18 models of the redshift - space galaxy power spectrum in the quasi - linear regime that we will try fitting to our measurements .",
    "these models are listed in table [ tabmodlist ] .",
    "we assume that the shape of the underlying linear matter power spectrum is accurately determined by observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation , and hence we fix the background cosmological parameters . in this case",
    "each redshift - space power spectrum model contains at least two parameters to be fitted : the growth rate @xmath62 and a linear bias @xmath63 . in several cases discussed below",
    "we introduce a third parameter , a variable damping coefficient @xmath64 .",
    "the multipole power spectra of these models at redshift @xmath65 are compared in figure [ figpklmod ] assuming a linear bias @xmath66 , a growth rate @xmath67 and ( where applicable ) a damping term @xmath68 km s@xmath8 . for the purposes of illustration ,",
    "all models in figure [ figpklmod ] are divided by a smooth `` no - wiggles '' reference power spectrum from the fitting formulae of eisenstein & hu ( 1998 ) , which has the same shape as the linear power spectrum but without the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations .

    "equation [ eqdelta ] assumes that the galaxy separation is small compared with the distance to the galaxies , @xmath69 and @xmath75 are small , the velocity field @xmath72 is irrotational , and the continuity equation holds . in this case the linear redshift - space power spectrum of a population of galaxies may be written @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 are the isotropic galaxy - galaxy , galaxy-@xmath75 and @xmath75-@xmath75 power spectra for modes @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "we will often refer to the @xmath4 as the `` velocity power spectrum '' although it would be better described as the `` power spectrum of the velocity divergence field '' .",

    "the growth factor is defined in terms of the amplitude of a single perturbation as @xmath85 .",
    "equation [ eqflow ] additionally assumes that the linearized euler and poisson equations hold in a perturbed friedmann - robertson - walker universe .",
    "it represents a coherent flow of matter in which there is a one - to - one coupling between the fourier components of the velocity divergence and density fields .    under the assumption of a deterministic , scale - independent , local , linear bias @xmath63 then @xmath86 and we may write @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "if we additionally assume that equation [ eqflow ] applies , then equation [ eqpklin ] may be written @xmath89 equation [ eqpkkaiser ] is known as the large - scale `` kaiser limit '' of the redshift - space power spectrum model ( kaiser 1987 ) , often expressed in terms of the parameter @xmath90 .",
    "we assume no velocity bias between galaxies and matter ( lau , nagai & kravtsov 2010 ) .",
    "simulations and observations have demonstrated that equation [ eqpkkaiser ] is an unreliable model on all but the largest scales ( smallest values of @xmath41 ) due to the non - linear growth of structure .",
    "deviations from the kaiser limit are evident for @xmath91 mpc@xmath8 and are particularly noticeable in the @xmath75 power spectra ( jennings et al .",
    "2011 ; okumura et al .",
    "this failure of the model is due to the breakdown of the relation between @xmath75 and @xmath84 ( equation [ eqflow ] ) rather than the underlying structure of equation [ eqpklin ] ( scoccimarro 2004 ) .",
    "non - linear evolution implies that a given overdensity @xmath84 produces a range of values of @xmath75 , and this range of velocities acts to smooth the galaxy overdensity field in redshift - space , or damp the @xmath75 power spectra .",
    "this non - linear damping must be modelled in order to avoid introducing a systematic error into our extraction of the growth rate @xmath62 from data .",
    "a variety of methods are available for implementing this non - linear correction , which we discuss below .",

    "the lorentzian model produces better fits to data ( e.g.  hawkins et al .",
    "2003 , cabre & gaztanaga 2009 ) and we assume this version of the model in our study .",
    "equation [ eqpkstream ] is typically applied assuming that @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are predicted by linear theory assuming equation [ eqflow ] , hence for the lorentzian model we obtain @xmath99 where we generated the linear power spectrum @xmath100 using the camb software package ( lewis , challinor & lasenby 2000 ) .",
    "this is _ model 1 _ in table [ tabmodlist ] .",
    "we also considered the case where a non - linear density power spectrum @xmath101 , generated by applying the fitting formula of smith et al .",

    "these fourier modes describe physical scales of tens of @xmath106 mpc , far exceeding the size of virialized structures .",
    "in addition , the form of @xmath92 and the value of @xmath64 depend strongly on details such as galaxy type , dark matter halo mass and satellite fraction .",
    "however , it should be noted that equation [ eqpkemp1 ] does a very reasonable job of empirically modelling real datasets at the precision available in previous redshift surveys ( e.g. , hawkins et al .",
    "2003 , cabre & gaztanaga 2009 ) .",
    "a different approach to modelling clustering beyond linear scales is to extend equations [ eqpklin ] and [ eqflow ] into the quasi - linear regime using perturbation theory techniques .",
    "these approaches have the advantage of a stronger physical motivation compared to the empirical streaming models , and the disadvantage that they are potentially applicable for a narrower range of scales , depending on the type of perturbation expansion .",

    "as discussed by scoccimarro ( 2004 ) , the model of equation [ eqdamp ] is an approximation in which the gaussian damping factor attempts to reproduce the correct non - linear behaviour ; equation [ eqdamp ] can not be strictly derived from theory . given this approximation we consider fitting @xmath64 as a variable parameter in addition to fixing it using equation [ eqsig ] .",

    "<S> we present precise measurements of the growth rate of cosmic structure for the redshift range @xmath0 , using redshift - space distortions in the galaxy power spectrum of the wigglez dark energy survey . </S>",
    "<S> our results , which have a precision of around @xmath1 in four independent redshift bins , are well - fit by a flat @xmath2cdm cosmological model with matter density parameter @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis hence indicates that this model provides a self - consistent description of the growth of cosmic structure through large - scale perturbations and the homogeneous cosmic expansion mapped by supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve robust results by systematically comparing our data with several different models of the quasi - linear growth of structure including empirical models , fitting formulae calibrated to n - body simulations , and perturbation theory techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we extract the first measurements of the power spectrum of the velocity divergence field , @xmath4 , as a function of redshift ( under the assumption that @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the galaxy overdensity field ) , and demonstrate that the wigglez galaxy - mass cross - correlation is consistent with a deterministic ( rather than stochastic ) scale - independent bias model for wigglez galaxies for scales @xmath7 mpc@xmath8 . </S>",
