    "also , we see that for existence of second limit cycle we need the existence of the point @xmath179 , which we denote here as @xmath490 .    since by induction hypothesis",
    "the theorem is true for @xmath482 , so it follows that in each and every interval @xmath491   $ ] , @xmath492 the system @xmath11 has a limit cycle and the outermost limit cycle cuts the @xmath287 axis somewhere in @xmath493 .",

    "since there is only one limit cycle in the region @xmath496 , so it is clear that @xmath115 must change its sign from @xmath488 to @xmath485 once and only once as @xmath108 moves out of @xmath497 along the curve @xmath89 .",

    "<S> we also give improved estimates of amplitudes of the limit cycle of the van der pol equation for various values of the nonlinearity parameter . </S>",
