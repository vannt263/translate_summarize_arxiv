    "x - ray selection has been shown to be a powerful way of selecting pre - main sequence ( pms ) late - type stars , already using _ einstein _",
    "observations of star - forming regions ( sfr ) , as for example shown by @xcite in the sco - cen sfr , where they identified several previously unknown pms stars by studying the newly detected x - ray sources .",
    "this technique has recently been extensively applied to the stellar counterparts of soft x - ray sources detected in the rass ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , hereafter collectively referred to as the `` rass - wtts papers '' ) yielding a large number of candidate pms stars , which are generally referred to as `` weak - line t - tauri stars '' ( wtts ) , as they do not show any of the extreme spectral characteristics ( strong emission lines , and large amount of `` veiling '' ) typical of classical t - tauri stars ( ctts ) . the abundance of pms stars identified in the rass , even far away from obvious sites of star formation , has raised several questions about the mechanisms of low - mass star formation , about the recent history of star - formation in the solar neighborhood , and about the mechanisms responsible for the spatial diffusion of newborn stars from their sites of formation .",
    "these questions have for example been addressed in detail by @xcite , who has discussed various possible models for the diffusion of young stars from their place of birth , to match the wtts population identified around the chameleon star forming region investigated by @xcite .",
    "one persistent difficulty observed by @xcite is that the putative age of the rass wtts population is consistently too young .",
    "one proposed way of accounting for such a large number of very young stars far away from their plausible birthplace is to assume the presence of a large number of spatially sparse , small sites of star formation which have , by the time these stars have been observed , dissipated away .",
    "the concentration of low - mass star formation in these small sites would challenge much of our understanding of low - mass star formation . as @xcite remarks",
    ", these explanations must be considered as tentative , as the possibility that a fraction of the rass high - lithium stars are already on the main sequence can not be discarded .",
    "@xcite reach , for the rass stars , the same conclusion which was reached earlier for the _ einstein _  extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) by @xcite , namely that the majority of low - mass stars detected in x - ray flux - limited surveys at the flux levels typical of the rass and of the emss are likely to be young main sequence stars , rather than pms stars . to support this statement , @xcite use a numerical approach , similar to the one presented by @xcite , and applied by @xcite and @xcite to the data from the emss , similarly concluding that the majority of the low - mass stars detected in the rass are likely to be young main - sequence stars .",
    "very similar conclusions are reached by @xcite who have developed a similar ( although fully independent ) model of galactic coronal x - ray source counts .",
    "their work includes a more detailed modeling of the scale - height evolution of the young stellar populations , and thus succeeds in better predicting the low - latitude population .",
    "this model has been shown to match well the observations of low - latitude rass fields ( @xcite ) , again showing the predominance of young main - sequence coronal sources .",
    "the large numbers of wtts identified in the rass - wtts papers is in contrast with the small number of young ( from a few times @xmath0 up to @xmath1yr of age ) main - sequence stars in the same samples .",
    "for example , the low number of non - pms coronal sources detected by @xcite contrasts sharply with the much larger number of such sources detected in the rass by @xcite .",
    "the contrast is even more striking if one considers that the latter sample has a shallower limiting flux .",
    "an analysis of the rass - wtts papers shows that the attribution of wtts `` nature '' has been done on the basis of low - resolution spectra , and that no lithium abundance determination has been used to assess the ( eventual ) pms status of individual sources . either the eventual presence of a `` strong ''  doublet ( the watershed feature used to discriminate between `` wtts '' and `` other active stars '' )",
    "is quoted as determining the `` wtts nature '' of a source ( without any quantitative definition of `` strong '' , as in @xcite ) or a single mass - independent , minimum equivalent width of the  doublet is taken as discriminating between wtts and other active stars ( as in @xcite ) . in all the above works , the equivalent width of the  doublet is measured using spectra with resolution ranging from @xmath2  to @xmath3 .",
    "experience shows that the detection , and , a fortiori , the measurement of weak spectral features in low - resolution spectra is an uncertain operation , and that the measurement of spectral features whose equivalent width is a small fraction of the spectral resolution is likely to be fraught with large systematic as well as statistical errors . to assess the reliability of a wtts identification process based only on low - resolution spectra",
    ", we have analyzed the low- ( @xmath2 ) and high - resolution ( @xmath4 ) spectra of a number of active stars spanning a wide range of spectral types and lithium abundances .",
    "we have also studied the influence of the usage of a single watershed value for the equivalent width of the  feature as determining whether a source is a wtts or not , noting the systematic biases in the resulting samples of x - ray selected wtts .",
    "the present paper is structured as follow : sect .",
    "[ sec : sample ] briefly presents the sample of stars whose spectra have been studied here and describes the data reduction , sect .",
    "[ sec : anal ] discusses the derivation of  doublet equivalent widths and compares in detail the results obtained from low- and high - resolution spectra , sect .",

    "for all these stars we had available both low- and high - resolution spectra .",
    "the stars were selected to span a range of spectral types , as well as of lithium abundance .",
    "the sample stars have spectral types ranging from g0 to m0 , and have lithium abundances ( as determined on the basis on high - resolution spectroscopy by @xcite ) ranging from below the detection limit in high - resolution spectra ( implying equivalent widths of the  6707.8  doublet smaller than @xmath3m ) up to cosmic lithium abundance ( @xmath5 )",

    "the high - resolution spectra were acquired using the eso cat 1.4 m telescope with the coud echelle spectrometer ( ces ) .",
    "the short camera with the rca ccd ( eso # 9 ) was used , yielding an effective resolution of about 50000 ( or @xmath21  per pixel ) .",
    "the spectra are centered on the  6707.8  doublet , and cover the range @xmath22@xmath23 .",
    "the data reduction procedure has been described in detail in @xcite , to which the reader is referred for details .",
    "these spectra allow a measurement of the equivalent width of the  6707.8  doublet to a precision of a few m  ( depending on the rotational velocity ) , and thus form an excellent benchmark for checking the possibility of measuring the equivalent width of the same line at lower resolutions .",
    "a representative segment of the low - resolution spectra used in the present work is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : lr ] , in which the expected positions of the  6707.8  doublet and of the nearby   6717.7  line are shown by vertical dashed lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : lr2 ] shows an enlargement of the same spectra , trimmed to cover a small region near the  doublet , and expanded vertically by a factor of 5 , for clarity .",
    "all the stars in the sample appear to have a spectral feature in absorption at the expected position of the  doublet .",
    "we have measured the equivalent width of the line present in the low resolution spectra at the expected position of the  doublet , using the iraf splot task , by fitting two gaussians , one to the line identified with the  doublet itself , and the other to the nearby  feature , which is often blended with the  feature .",
    "the best - fit equivalent widths are reported in table  [ tab : sample ] , together with the difference between the true and measured ( on the low - resolution spectra ) distance between 6708  feature and the 6717  feature .",
    "this last quantity can be used as a measure of the reliability of the identification of the feature near 6708  with the  line , as it should be significantly smaller than the spectral resolution ( it indeed is for all the program stars ) .",
    "we have found the measurement of such weak features ( few hundreds of m  at most ) on spectra of such low resolution to be an uncertain process .",
    "the lack of any line - free continuum in the neighborhood of the line in question makes continuum estimation a subjective process , and we estimate the uncertainty due to placement of the continuum alone to be at least some 100m .",
    "such uncertainty is in line with the uncertainty quoted by @xcite , for their measurements on similar spectra , of 150m  ( i.e. comparable , or often larger than the equivalent width being measured . their quoted uncertainty is independent of the spectral resolution ) .",
    "all the equivalent widths measured in the low - resolution spectra for the feature at @xmath24  are higher than the true equivalent width of the  doublet , sometimes by several hundreds m , and would , taken at face value , imply ( following the criteria of the rass - wtts papers ) that all the sources discussed here are pms , or , more specifically , wtt stars . yet , none of these stars shows evidence of being a wtts when real lithium abundances are derived from high - resolution spectra of the same stars .",
    "the two later - type high - lithium sources in our sample , 1es0250@xmath912.9 and 1es0457@xmath601.7a , which could be suspected of being pms stars , while certainly young , are also very close to the main - sequence , and certainly not any longer on the hayashi track , as unambiguously shown , on the basis of hipparcos parallaxes , by @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the 6708  feature in low - resolution spectra of low - mass stars is thus very likely to lead to a significant over - estimate the true lithium abundance .",
    "even worse , two sources ( 1es0327@xmath924.2 and 1es1044@xmath949.1 ) which have no measurable lithium down to less than 10m  in their high - resolution spectra , appear to have a similar feature at 6708  as the stars with deep  doublets visible in their low - resolution spectra . furthermore , there seems to be no clear relationship between the equivalent width of the 6708  feature measured in low - resolution spectra and the equivalent width of the  doublet , as the very large measurement error makes it impossible to simply subtract the ( metallicity and effective temperature dependent ) `` foot '' due to the contribution of the  lines to the feature measured in the low - resolution spectrum deriving the `` true '' equivalent width of the  doublet .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatt ] , which shows a scatter plot of the equivalent width of the the  feature as measured in low - resolution spectra as a function of its `` true '' equivalent width .",
    "figure  [ fig : li ] shows , superimposed , the high- and low - resolution spectra of 1es0250@xmath912.9 , a high - lithium k1 dwarf .",
    "both spectra are shifted to the rest wavelength of the spectral lines . as it is obvious from the plot , both the `` '' and the `` '' feature in the low resolution spectrum are actually a blend of several spectral features , making it impossible to accurately derive the true equivalent width of the parent lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : noli ] shows the same type of spectra for 1es1044@xmath949.1 , a g5 giant which has ( as evident from the high resolution spectrum ) no measurable lithium .",
    "remarkably , the   lines evident in the high - resolution spectrum `` bunch '' together , in the low - resolution spectrum , to mimic a feature at a wavelength not distinguishable ( at these resolutions ) from a feature containing a sizable contribution from the  doublet , and which would thus be confused with it in the absence of high - resolution spectra .",
    "the strength of the 6708  feature visible in the low - resolution spectra of g and k stars thus appears not to be a reliable indicator of the equivalent width of the lithium doublet , and bears little relationship with the actual lithium abundance of the source .",
    "the presence of an absorption feature at 6708  in low - resolution spectra , should thus not , per se , be taken as an indication of the possible pms status of a g- or k - type star .",
    "further studies on both the low- and high - resolution spectra of large samples would be needed to asses whether , in the presence of a very accurate wavelenght solution for the low - resolution spectrum , the lithium - mimicking feature visible in li - poor stars could be reliably distinguished from a true  feature . even if this were the case , however , the problem of the associated large uncertainty in the derived equivalent width ( related to the low resolution ) would still stand .",
    "m stars are likely to be easier targets for spotting wtts sources from low - resolution spectra . in cooler stars most metallic lines ( such as the  lines in the region around the  doublet ) become weak , and merge in a maze of molecular lines ( mostly from tio and from hydrides , specially mgh ) , forming , in a low - resolution spectrum , a pseudo - continuum against which a strong  doublet is likely to stand out . at the same time , for a given lithium abundance the equivalent width of the  doublet will be stronger , because of the lower ionization fraction of lithium at lower temperature . while we do not have available , for m stars , an extensive library of both high- and low - resolution spectra , we had a few low - resolution spectra of active m stars with no measurable lithium in their high - resolution spectra and of bona fide m - type wtts with a strong lithium line visible in high - resolution spectra .",
    "at the low resolution discussed here ( also @xmath2 ) these stars appear to be easily distinguishable .",
    "the low - resolution spectra of three of these m stars are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : m2 ] and  [ fig : m ] , which are analogous to figs .",
    "[ fig : lr ] and  [ fig : lr2 ] shown earlier for g and k stars .",
    "the bottom star in both figures ( g102@xmath921 , which has been discussed by @xcite ) has no measurable lithium line in its high - resolution spectrum ( and has no 6708  feature in its low - resolution spectrum ) , while the two top spectra are from bona fide wtt stars in the sco - cen sfr reported by @xcite , and have clearly visible 6708  features .",
    "the presence of strong lithium in absorption in their spectra has been determined by @xcite on the basis of high - resolution spectra , and it is reported in table  [ tab : samplem ] .",
    "the low - resolution spectrum of g102@xmath921 is very similar to the spectra of the wtts , the only visible difference in their spectra being the  doublet in absorption .",

    "the measured equivalent width of the  doublet in low- and high - resolution spectra for m stars are compatible within the large observational error of the low - resolution measurements .",
    "for m stars low - resolution spectra thus appear to be a useful tool to search for high - lithium stars .",
    "again , however , any quantitative attempt at measuring the equivalent width of the  doublet on low - resolution spectra is still likely to be affected by large errors , whose amount will depend both on the spectral resolution used and on the precise spectral type and metallicity of the star being observed .",
    "the attribution of a precise age to individual stars is difficult , specially when individual accurate distances are not available , which , specially for young stars , allow the placement on evolutionary tracks .",
    "the only available indicator of wtts status for individual low - mass stars of unknown distance is the presence of a very large lithium abundance : low - mass stars are supposed to burn lithium at the basis of their convective zones , with lower mass stars having proportionally deeper convection zones and thus shorter lithium depletion characteristics times . the available observational evidence , however , is not so simple , and all the currently available data point toward several factors , in addition to age , influencing the lithium abundance of a low - mass star .",
    "old dwarfs earlier than g5 show a large range of lithium abundance , with lithium - rich stars being found at essentially any age ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and the same stars still have essentially undepleted lithium when they are well in the main sequence stage ( as in the pleiades , @xcite ) , showing that the lithium criterium is of little relevance for their being classified as pms sources . for low - mass stars cooler than @xmath28 g5 , the evidence so far available points toward lithium being depleted with age , although young stars have a wide range of lithium abundance at any given age , as shown , for example , by @xcite for the solar - type stars in the pleiades , and by @xcite for the @xmath29 persei cluster .",
    "thus , while high levels of lithium ( i.e.  comparable to the `` cosmic '' abundance , @xmath5 on the usual scale where @xmath30 ) are characteristic of g- and k - type pms stars ( and are a `` necessary '' condition for being classified as a pms ) , a lithium abundance of order @xmath31 is by no means sufficient for classifying a star as pms , given than many stars down to mid - k spectral type in the pleiades have a lithium abundance close to 3.0 , yet they clearly are on ( or very close to ) the main sequence .    given that cooler stars are expected ( and generally observed ) to be depleting their lithium more rapidly than higher mass solar - type stars , it is not possible to adopt a single , mass - independent threshold of the lithium abundance as discriminating between pms and main - sequence stars , with the same lithium abundance having quite different implications on the evolutionary status in g , k or m stars .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cog ] , in which we have plotted the lithium abundance implied by different ( true ) observed equivalent widths of the   doublet , for an equivalent width of 100 , 200 and 300m .",
    "the region to the left of the thick vertical line in fig .",
    "[ fig : cog ] is the region occupied by the early- to mid - g dwarfs , for which lithium can not be used to separate pms and main - sequence objects .",
    "the boundary of the dashed region is the approximate upper boundary of the lithium abundances measured in the pleiades by @xcite , so that any star lying outside the dashed region has lithium abundances compatible with its being a main sequence star .",
    "the region in which pms stars can be discriminated from the lithium abundance is thus the dashed area in fig .",
    "[ fig : cog ] , although , given the spread of lithium abundance observed at any given age , the actual boundary has to be assumed to be quite fuzzy . taking a mass - independent threshold of 100m  for the equivalent width of the  doublet will select ( as already remarked by @xcite ) , in addition to whatever true wtts there may be in the sample , many stars which are simply young main sequence stars , thus inflating the detected number of wtts with several spurious sources .",
    "a threshold of @xmath32m   would approximately follow the sloping boundary of the shaded region , but at the same time it would miss many true wtts among the hotter stars , as well as a few at the cooler end .",
    "as remarked in the sect .  [ sec : intro ] , the rass - wtts papers show a severe lack of normal , young active main - sequence stars in their samples .",
    "for example , @xcite report ( see their table  4 ) to have investigate 112 x - ray sources ( in an area of @xmath33 square deg ) around the chameleon sfr , and , among the 112 x - ray sources studied , to have found 75 new wtts and only 10 active stars which are not classified as wtts on the basis of their low - resolution spectra .",
    "it is suggestive , in the light of the results of sect .",
    "[ sec : anal ] and  [ sec : m ] , that the non - wtts active stars reported by @xcite are all dme stars , as it is at these spectral types that low - resolution spectra have some diagnostic value .",
    "in addition to this , they report another 13 non - wtt stellar sources which were previously known , although from their table  6 it appears that some are early - type stars and thus non - coronal sources .",
    "thus , 23 non - wtt stars , or 18 , subtracting the early - type stars , in @xmath33 square deg . for",
    "the same sky area @xcite report a limiting sensitivity of @xmath34 ( the same limiting sensitivity can be derived from the rass exposure time in the region of @xmath35s reported by @xcite , leading to a limiting pspc count rate of @xmath36ctss@xmath37 ) .",
    "a computation based on the model of @xcite and @xcite predicts at this limiting flux level , between 60 and 80 active , non - pms stars , in that area of the sky , depending on the assumed value for the space density of rs  cvn binaries .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath38 higher than the 23 active non - pms stars reported by @xcite , showing that many of the putative wtts in their sample are likely to be misclassified main - sequence stars .",
    "note that the computation discussed here is in full agreement with the observed numbers in the emss , i.e. these large numbers of young main - sequence objects are not only expected , at the x - ray flux levels , but their presence has already been verified on fully identified samples . the @xcite model , predicts an even larger number of main - sequence stellar sources , i.e. about one per square degree at these fluxes and latitudes , approximately two thirds of which are expected to be of age 1gyr or older ( and with a significant fraction of the ones younger than 1gyr being on the main sequence ) .",
    "a similar prediction is made by @xcite .",
    "the @xcite model has been shown by @xcite to provide a good match to the rass population of the galactic plane , where they report 77 coronal sources in a sky area about half the size and at a limiting flux approximately twice as shallow of the one surveyed by @xcite  although at slightly lower galactic latitude .",
    "later works in the rass - wtts line find significantly higher fractions of non - pms coronal sources .",
    "for example , @xcite find , in the tau - aur region ( where the rass exposure time is @xmath39s ) , significant numbers of non - pms coronal sources , even in a sample which had been optimized for searching for pms sources .",
    "the difference in methodology is at least in part likely to be the cause of the difference in the detected source population , and in particular the larger spectral resolution employed ( @xmath40 ) , which allows better discrimination of true wtts from main - sequence stars .",
    "we have shown , by analysis of the low - resolution spectra of a number of low - mass stars spanning a wide range of spectral types as well as of lithium abundances , and by direct comparison of their low- and high - resolution spectra , that usage of low - resolution spectra alone is likely to lead , at least in g and k stars , to high inferred lithium abundances in late - type stars .",
    "an absorption feature at 6708   appears to be commonly present , in the low - resolution spectra of g and k stars , independently from their actual lithium abundance .",
    "such feature appears to be present , for stars later than @xmath28 m0 , only in true high - lithium sources .",
    "thus , classification of stellar counterparts to soft x - ray sources done exclusively on the basis of low - resolution optical spectroscopy is likely to significantly over - estimate the number of pms stars present in the source population .",
    "we have also shown that , even with fully reliable   equivalent widths , the adoption of a single equivalent width threshold will lead to over - estimate the number of wtts sources present in the sample .    as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , several works have recently appeared in the literature which present the identification of stellar counterparts to soft x - ray sources based on low - resolution spectra alone .",
    "these works discuss x - ray sources in the general direction of star forming regions , but usually cover large region of the sky , extending to quite large projected distances from the sfr . a common feature to all these works",
    "is that they seem to find , in addition to the expected concentration of pms stars in and around the sfr , a large number of widespread wtts with no apparent immediate relationship with the sfr under investigation , which , as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , are a challenge to current ideas of low - mass star formation . at the same time , the same samples lack the large number of young main - sequence coronal sources which are known to be present in x - ray selected samples at these flux levels .",
    "we make the hypothesis that a non - negligible fraction of the `` field wtts '' discussed in the rass - wtts papers are normal , active young low - mass stars , on , or very near to the main sequence .",
    "the arbitrary placement of foreground active stars at the distance of the putative parent sfr ( which is common practice in the wtts - rass papers ) will make them appear brighter then they actually are , and thus make them wrongly appear as still in a pms contraction phase when placed on evolutionary tracks .",
    "the apparent large number of dispersed wtts are thus most likely not the solution to the still standing puzzle of the apparent lack of the deficiency of stars older than @xmath41myr in most known star forming regions ( the so - called missing post - t tauri problem ) , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently argued that the post - t tauri problem is a false one , as it is based on the assumption of a constant star - formation rate in giant molecular clouds , an assumption which , based on the similarity between the molecular cloud lifetime and the ambipolar diffusion time they show to be unlikely",
    ". rather , they argue , star formation accelerates sharply toward the end of a cloud s lifetime , thus justifying the lack of large numbers of older pms in sfrs .",
    "@xcite have recently used the hipparcos parallaxes of the subsample of emss and ess stars which have been observed by hipparcos to accurately position these stars in an hr diagram , showing that only one of the stars in the sample is far away from the main sequence and clearly still in a contracting phase . the rest of the population is mostly composed of main - sequence objects , with @xmath42% giants . while this subsample suffers from a bias toward brighter stars , and it is thus lacking many of the fainter and more active stars ( some of which are known to be pms stars from their lithium abundance ) ,",
    "they show that all of the stars in their sample ( seven ) which would have been classified as wtts using the @xcite 100m  criterium ( even using high - resolution spectra , and thus reliable  doublet equivalent widths ) are very close to or on the main - sequence .",
    "thus , while there certainly are a number of bona fide wtt stars in the sample of active stars selected from the _ einstein _  surveys ( as for example the low - gravity , very high lithium abundance stars of @xcite ) , the majority of the low - mass stars appear however to be already on or very close to the main sequence stage . given the similar limiting sensitivity of the rass and of the emss , the detected source population has to be similar , and therefore , again , a large fraction of the rass stellar sources are expected not to be in the pms stage but rather young main - sequence stars .    obviously , a ( perhaps considerable ) fraction of the stars identified in the rass identification programs discussed above will be true wtts , still contracting toward the main sequence , given also the vicinity of the surveyed areas to sfr s .",
    "however , lacking accurate , high - resolution based lithium abundances and distance measurements , they can not be separated from the normal active main - sequence stars present in the sample . given the type of biases and their dependence on the stellar mass , it is likely that the fraction of bona fide wtts will be higher among late k and m stars , and lower for f and g stars .",
    "any definitive assessment of the true nature of these rass sources and of the ( statistical ) properties of rass - selected pms populations will thus have to wait for the availability of high - resolution spectroscopic data , including measurements of the  doublet , which will help in screening the bona fide wtts sources in the sample , at least for the cooler stars ."

    "<S> the approach taken in most of the current literature for identifying and classifying wtt stars among rass x - ray sources is based on the usage of low - resolution optical spectra only and on simple , mass - independent thresholds on the equivalent width of the  6707.8   doublet . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this approach is likely to lead to putative wtts samples which contain a large number of normal , young main - sequence stars masquerading as wtts sources . </S>",
    "<S> young main - sequence stars are known to be the dominant contributor in stellar x - ray selected samples at the limiting flux levels of the rass , yet they appear to be very rare in the rass samples discussed here . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that many of the putative wtts sources are actually mis - classified young main - sequence stars , and that thus there is likely not a true `` wtts question '' in the rass samples . </S>"
