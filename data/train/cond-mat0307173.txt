    "the cooperative processes taking place in complex systems of agents interacting with each other , which were up to quite recently studied mainly by human sciences , became also an interesting object of research for physicists . despite the tremendous complexity of such systems and the presence of the unpredictable ingredients related to human free will",
    ", some of the statistical regularities which characterise their collective behaviour can be studied using models and techniques developed in the field of statistical physics .",
    "as usually in such situations one builds very abstract theoretical models which have a much wider applicability . the so called minority game , for example ,",
    "was proposed as a formalisation of the el - farol bar problem @xcite , in order to capture the essential features of traders interaction in a stock exchange market @xcite .",
    "but the same model can describe a more general situation where many agents compete for the exploitation of a number of scarce resources @xcite .",
    "this seemingly simple model turns out to exhibit a surprisingly rich variety of complex behaviours which were studied thoroughly using various methods @xcite .",
    "the statistical mechanics approach to this sort of models is particularly interesting as it reveals aspects of cooperative phenomena which may be qualitatively different from those studied in physics .",
    "the minority game is based on the assumption that agents prefer to avoid crowds .",
    "hence they tend to use those strategies which let them be as often as possible in the minority .",
    "this is only one of many possible types of interactions .",
    "it seems natural to ask what happens under the reversed ( majority ) rule , favouring those strategies which allow the agents to stay on the side of the majority .    in the economic interpretation of this sort of models ,",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the minority rule describes so - called `` fundamental '' or `` contrarian '' traders in a financial market .",
    "these are agents who believe that market prices are close to an equilibrium and hence expect that price fluctuations tend to generate price changes towards the equilibrium value .",
    "the majority rule is instead appropriate for trend followers , whose behaviour is thought to be responsible for the so called `` bubbles ''  buy rushes leading to price increases well beyond those which would be justified by an economic evaluation .",
    "the majority mechanism is self - reinforcing as it generates self - fulfilling prophecies : if the agents expect that the price will rise ( fall ) , the majority of them will buy ( sell ) which will actually make the price rise ( fall ) .    before focusing on the majority game ,",
    "let us mention that the competition between majority and minority players has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the simplest setting and in ref .",
    "@xcite in its full complexity .    from a wider perspective",
    ", the majority game describes a situation where the profit of agents increases with the number of agents acting in the same way .",
    "conformity effects of this type are evident in the spreading of fashions .",
    "a further example may be that of a shop which lowers the prices as the number of customers increases , or of a product which becomes cheaper the more it is popular .",
    "this mechanism , which goes under the name of _ increasing returns _ in economics , lies at the heart of quite interesting aggregation phenomena  for example the emergence of cities and economic districts such as silicon valley and hollywood @xcite .",
    "as we shall see the study of majority game leads to the analysis of models which are very similar to attractor neural networks , in particular to the hopfield model @xcite . in brief ,",
    "agents learning dynamics is different from glauber dynamics , but the energy landscape where it takes place is the same .",
    "it turns out that aggregation in the majority game is the same phenomenon as memory retrieval in the hopfield model .",
    "hence the physics of neural networks tells us a lot about the behaviour of the majority game . on the other hand",
    ", this study also provides new results on the physics of neural networks by probing the energy landscapes such as that of the hopfield model with a different type of dynamics .",
    "our work is based on a statistical mechanics approach to the stationary states of the majority game and its results are verified by numerical simulations .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the next section we introduce the model and in section 3 we discuss its stationary states  we show that they can be identified with the local minima of the hopfield type hamiltonian .",
    "section 4 deals with the calculation of free energy and the construction of the phase diagram .",
    "given that stationary states are selected in a dynamical way and not according to a boltzmann weight , we compare our results with extensive numerical simulations . in order to clarify the dynamical behaviour of the model , we discuss the number of stationary states in section 5 .",
    "we conclude with a summary of the main results and a discussion of their implications .",
    "we consider a system consisting of @xmath0 agents interacting at discrete time intervals ( at each round of the game ) .",
    "the interaction takes place through the action , concerning @xmath1 objects or resources , which each agent undertakes .",
    "the actions are determined by one of @xmath2 strategies which are chosen randomly and independently for each of the agents at the beginning of the game . in the course of the game the agents can change their actions only by changing their strategies , i.e. choosing one of the @xmath2 predefined ones ( for each agent ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the action taken by agent @xmath4 concerning resource @xmath5 when he / she adopts strategy @xmath6 .",
    "we consider here the case of binary actions @xmath7 .",
    "the specific values of @xmath3  the realisation of quenched disorder  are drawn at random from some distribution .",
    "thus a strategy is a binary vector , which can be interpreted for instance as a list of actions to be undertaken concerning each of the objects .",
    "agent @xmath8 chooses the strategy used in the next round of the game on the basis of the performances of his / her strategies in the previous runs , which are measured by a score functions @xmath9 .",
    "the agents choose the strategy @xmath10 with the highest score and undertake the profile of actions @xmath11 @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the agents know about the actions of others only through the cumulative actions :    @xmath14    which are used to update the score functions :    @xmath15~,\\label{majrule}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 $ ] are constants .",
    "let us first discuss this dynamics for @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath19 has the same sign as the action undertaken by the majority concerning object @xmath20 . then eq .",
    "( [ majrule ] ) implies that those strategies prescribing an action aligned with the majority are rewarded .",
    "in other words , by this learning dynamics , agents strive to find that strategy which puts them in the majority .",
    "because of the averaging over @xmath20 this rule is called a batch version of the majority game .",
    "the on - line version , where a value @xmath21 is randomly drawn at each time and agents update the scores depending on @xmath22 , will be discussed in the concluding section .    with parameter @xmath23",
    "one can change the degree to which the agents take into account the influence of their own actions on the cumulative quantity @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular the case @xmath24 describes agents who are learning to respond optimally to the behaviour of the others . indeed for @xmath24 eq . ( [ majrule ] ) computes the correct value of @xmath19 if agent @xmath8 had actually played strategy @xmath25 .",
    "this is what game theory assumes a rational player should do , so the stationary states of the game for @xmath24 are nash equilibria ( i.e. those states where each agent takes the optimal strategy , given the strategy of others  @xcite ) .",
    "like in the minority game @xcite , in spite of the fact that @xmath26 is much larger than @xmath27 , the @xmath28 term is not negligible .",
    "the new , updated payoff functions are used to determine the action in the next time step through eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath19 is the difference between the size of the two groups of agents who undertake opposite actions @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "if agents do not interact and the actions @xmath31 and @xmath30 are equivalent , it is obvious that @xmath32 .",
    "we shall pay special attention , in what follows , to the possibility that , when turning on the interaction , a _ macroscopic difference _",
    "@xmath33 may emerge , for some value of @xmath20 .      in this paper we will focus on the case where @xmath34 .",
    "we allow for a correlation of the two strategies of the same agent by introducing a parameter @xmath35 with @xmath36 .    instead of keeping track of the two payoff functions it is enough to consider their difference :    @xmath37",
    "taking the average over the stationary state distribution , which we denote by @xmath38 , of the dynamical equation of @xmath39 , we get :    @xmath40    where we used a standard notation :    @xmath41 we expect that all the agents in the long time limit are frozen , i.e. they do not change their strategies . indeed , exactly as in the case of the minority game , it is easy to check that the stationary states correspond to the minima of @xmath42 the argument starts by observing that if @xmath43 , then @xmath44 , depending on the sign of @xmath45 , and hence @xmath46 . only if @xmath47 we can have @xmath48 .",
    "then one observes that @xmath49 so these conditions are equivalent to the conditions for the minima of @xmath50 .",
    "but it is evident , from the form of @xmath50 , that its minima lie only at the corners of the hypercube @xmath51^n$ ] .",
    "the conclusion that stationary states correspond to the minima of @xmath50 is straightforward from the dynamical equations in the limit @xmath52 .",
    "then one can introduce a rescaled continuous time @xmath53 and verify that @xmath50 is a lyapunov function of the continuum time dynamics .",
    "[ sim1 ] shows that numerical simulations fully confirm the above picture .",
    "note in particular that while the initial stages of the dynamics are somewhat noisy , fluctuations are negligible in the long time limit .",
    "strictly speaking there is no stationary state in terms of the variables @xmath54 as they diverge to @xmath55 .",
    "the term _ stationary state _ refers to the variables @xmath56 which take well defined values in the limit @xmath57 .",
    "we remark that the @xmath58 is simply related to the predictability @xmath59 introduced in the minority game  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath60 for all @xmath8 , @xmath61 is also equal to the volatility @xmath62 .",
    "hence agents in the majority game strive to maximise @xmath61 whereas agents in the minority game minimise it .",
    "@xmath50 is very similar to the hamiltonian of the hopfield model known from the theory of neural networks @xcite .",
    "the only differences are : the scaling with @xmath63 instead of @xmath64 , the presence of the random field and the fact that the patterns @xmath65 can take three values @xmath66 instead of only two @xmath67 . by analogy with physics we shall call @xmath50 energy .",
    "we notice that for @xmath68 one obtains the `` pure '' hopfield model ( with different rescaling ) , whereas for @xmath69 one has a majority game with independently chosen strategies .",

    "hence the set @xmath74 of stationary states satisfies the property @xmath75 for @xmath73 and , in particular , @xmath76 for all @xmath77 .",
    "it is also easy to see that the state with minimal value of @xmath50 lies in @xmath78 for all @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "this shows that nash equilibria are stationary state of the majority game for all values of @xmath28 , but the converse is not true .    in the remaining part of this article we will try to determine the nature of the stationary states of the majority game and calculate the number of such states . in the next section we will employ the replica method to analyse the thermodynamics ( for @xmath79 ) of the model defined by the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "then , using the stability relation ( [ stab ] ) we will calculate the number of stationary states in the annealed approximation as a function of various parameters .",

    "note that when we restrict ourselves to @xmath60 the @xmath28 term in @xmath50 becomes an irrelevant constant .",

    "these results allow us to draw some suggestions on the behaviour of systems of interacting agents driven by conformity or by increasing returns .",
    "the occurrence of a macroscopic overlap @xmath161 may correspond to crowd effects such as fashions and trends , when a large fraction of agents behave similarly in some respect , or to economic concentration , when , for example , one particular place is arbitrarily selected for large scale investments .",
    "the development of these crowd effects requires : _",
    "i ) _ that the number of agents is large compared to the number of resources ( @xmath115 small ) , _ ii ) _ a sufficient differentiation between strategies of agents ( @xmath163 ) and _ iii ) _ a large enough initial bias ( i.e. an initial macroscopic overlap ) towards a particular resource , fashion or place .",
    "finally crowd effects can be sustained under more general conditions ( i.e. in the spin glass phase ) if agents do not behave strategically , i.e. if they neglect their impact on the aggregate ( @xmath28 small ) .    besides the relevance of the model as a system of heterogeneous interacting agents , it is also interesting as an example of non - glauber dynamics in the energy landscape of hopfield type hamiltonians .",
