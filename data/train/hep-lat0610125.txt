    "the lattice formulation of quantum field theories provides a first principles approach to investigate non - perturbative aspects of high - energy physics . in this formulation",
    "the theory becomes equivalent to a statistical mechanical model , which can be studied numerically using monte carlo simulations ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) . as a consequence , the system considered evolves according to a markov process in the so - called monte carlo time and the action - weighted configuration - space average of the observables is substituted by a time average over successive ( independent ) field configurations of the system .",
    "the possibility to use monte carlo simulations to study the theory nonperturbatively is especially important in the case of quantum chromodynamics , the nonabelian @xmath2 gauge theory describing the strong interactions between hadrons .",
    "these simulations are computationally very demanding and must be done using local thermalization algorithms , since global methods ( such as cluster algorithms ) do not work well in this case .",
    "we should notice that , based on the above - mentioned equivalence , when the continuum limit of the lattice quantum field theory is taken , the corresponding statistical mechanical model approaches its critical point .",
    "more precisely , the distance from the critical point is given by the lattice parameter @xmath3 ( directly related to the lattice bare coupling constant ) , which corresponds to an inverse temperature .",
    "for nonabelian gauge theories ( as a consequence of asymptotic freedom ) the continuum limit is given by @xmath4 , i.e.  the critical point corresponds to temperature zero .",
    "the expected critical behavior is therefore similar to the one of a two - dimensional continuous - spin model ( e.g.  the classical heisenberg or @xmath0-vector spin model with @xmath5 ) or of a one - dimensional spin model , which show a critical point only at temperature zero , or @xmath4 .",
    "the process of obtaining independent field configurations is called _ thermalization _ and is usually carried out by applying at each link of the lattice a local algorithm , such as metropolis or heat bath ( hb ) .",
    "when a critical point is approached , this process is afflicted by the well - known phenomenon of _ critical slowing - down _ ( csd ) @xcite , which increases the correlation among successive field configurations .",
    "this implies that the _ integrated auto - correlation time _",
    "@xmath6 increases as a power of the lattice side @xmath7 . in particular , for the metropolis or hb algorithms one has @xmath8 ,",
    "i.e.  the _ dynamic critical exponent _",
    "@xmath9 is equal to 2 .",
    "since statistical monte - carlo errors are proportional to @xmath10 , numerical simulations become increasingly inefficient close to a critical point . in order to reduce the problem of csd",
    "one can combine the standard metroplis and hb algorithms with so - called micro - canonical updates , allowing larger jumps in the configuration space and therefore improving the generation of independent samples .",
    "this is the idea behind the so - called hybrid overrelaxation method @xcite . in general , adding a few micro - canonical sweeps greatly reduces csd and , correspondly , the computational work .",
    "a modification of the heat - bath algorithm , called overheat - bath ( ohb ) , was introduced some years ago in ref .",
    "the basic idea was to incorporate a micro - canonical move directly into the heat - bath step , thus reducing the computational cost while preserving the large moves in the configuration space . as it turns out , combining the two moves ( heat - bath and micro - canonical ) in a single step leads to a significant improvement in performance when compared to the hybrid overrelaxation method described above , which is based on alternating the two kinds of update moves .",
    "the resulting algorithm was indeed able to speed up the thermalization process , but , as already stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is not clear if it preserves ergodicity ( especially when working at small temperatures ) . the ohb algorithm is used today in numerical simulations @xcite , usually combined with other algorithms in order to ensure ergodicity . in this work",
    "we propose a modification of the overheat - bath algorithm , which we call the modified heat - bath algorithm ( mhb ) , incorporating a micro - canonical move into the heat - bath step without compromising ergodicity . in order to test the mhb algorithm",
    " and compare its performance with the standard hb algorithm and the ohb algorithm  we consider the @xmath11-vector spin model on a 1-dimensional lattice .",
    "note that the model is exactly solvable , which makes it especially suited for testing the algorithm and comparing results to the exact solution .",
    "let us also note that , due to the isometry between the groups @xmath12 and @xmath13 , it is possible to study the @xmath13 case with the same algorithm used for the @xmath11-vector case .",
    "more precisely , the _ local _ update  i.e.  the update of a single spin or gauge field variable while holding the rest of the lattice fixed  of the @xmath13 lattice gauge theory is identical to the one for the 4-vector model .",
    "this does not mean , however , that the _ global _ update of an @xmath13 gauge field configuration can be obtained from the corresponding update of a 4-vector model .",
    "indeed , the latter update can be done very efficiently using the swendsen - wang - wolff algorithm , while no such class of algorithms works well for lattice gauge theories .",
    "the method proposed here is therefore intended mostly for use in simulations of lattice gauge theories and not of @xmath0-vector models , although hybrid overrelaxation methods have also been applied in large - scale simulations of @xmath0-vector models @xcite .",
    "of course , an efficient thermalization in the @xmath13 case is of great physical interest , since the quenched @xmath14 case ( for @xmath15 ) is usually studied applying the @xmath13-embedding technique introduced in ref .",
    "the @xmath13 embedding is also used for simulating other lie groups , such as the @xmath16 and @xmath17 groups , in studies of the deconfinement phase transition @xcite .",
    "preliminary results for the @xmath18 @xmath13 case have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19-vector spin model ( on a 1-d lattice ) is defined by the hamiltonian = - _",
    "x=1^ns_x s_x+1 , [ eq : calh ] where the spins @xmath20 are four - dimensional unit vectors , @xmath211/temperature@xmath22 , @xmath23 is the lattice side and @xmath24 indicates a scalar product .    in the case of a local algorithm , one has to consider the contribution to the hamiltonian due to a single spin @xmath25 .",
    "this gives @xmath26 , where the `` effective magnetic field '' @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 .",
    "( here we consider periodic boundary conditions . )",
    "the above equation can also be written as _",
    "ss = - s_x _ x^ + , [ eq : hss2 ] where @xmath20 and @xmath29 are now interpreted as @xmath30 matrices in the fundamental representation and @xmath31 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : hss2 ] ) is clearly analogous to the expression of the single - link action obtained by considering the contribution of a single link variable to the @xmath30 wilson action @xcite .    using the single - side action ( [ eq : hss2 ] ) and the invariance of the group measure under group multiplication , one obtains the hb update @xcite s_x^old s_x^new = u_x . here",
    ", @xmath32 is an @xmath13 matrix , @xmath33 is the @xmath34 identity matrix , @xmath35 are the three pauli matrices and @xmath36 is randomly generated according to the distribution du_0 .",
    "[ eq : distr ] at the same time , the vector @xmath37  with components @xmath38 normalized to @xmath39  points along a uniformly chosen random direction in three - dimensional space @xcite .    in the hybrid over -",
    "relaxed algorithm one does @xmath40 micro - canonical ( or energy - conserving ) update sweeps over the lattice , followed by one hb sweep .",
    "the micro - canonical update is a local deterministic transformation applied to the @xmath13 matrix @xmath41 , which does not change the value of the hamiltonian .",
    "this is achieved by considering the update s_x^old s_x^new = _ x - s_x^old .",
    "[ eq : micro ] as stressed in the introduction , this update represents a large move in the configuration space , allowing the hybrid over - relaxed algorithm to reduce csd at the price of a greater computational cost , due to the micro - canonical sweeps . usually , by setting",
    "@xmath42 one obtains a strong reduction in the value of @xmath6 while increasing the computational cost by a factor smaller than 2 .    in the ohb",
    "@xcite one tries to include the micro - canonical step ( [ eq : micro ] ) directly into the heat - bath algorithm . to this end one",
    "generates @xmath36 according to the distribution ( [ eq : distr ] ) while the components of @xmath37 are not randomly chosen but are set using the relation @xmath43 , where @xmath44 . as a final step ,",
    "the vector @xmath37 is normalized to @xmath45 .",
    "clearly , the idea here is the same one applied in the standard hybrid over - relaxed algorithm : one tries to maximize the move in the configuration space by changing the sign of the component of @xmath46 that is orthogonal to the effective magnetic field .",
    "( note that the action @xmath47 can be viewed as the action of a matrix @xmath48 in an effective magnetic field given by the identity matrix @xmath49 . ) clearly , this step does not obey the uniform distribution for @xmath37 but is a microcanonical move .",
    "indeed we can think of the algorithm as a two - step process : a hb move followed by a microcanonical step .",
    "thus , the algorithm is _ exact _ but may not be ergodic .",
    "we analyze the conditions for applicability of the ohb algorithm in a separate work @xcite , but it is clear that for some initial configurations the algorithm can get `` trapped '' inside a subset of the space of configurations , compromising the ergodicity condition .",
    "one such configuration is , for example , a `` cold '' start for an @xmath0-vector model , in which all spins are aligned along a fixed direction . in this case , the ohb is not able to change the lattice configuration at all .",
    "there is a clear problem also if the initial configuration in the @xmath13-lattice - gauge - theory case is given by variables in an abelian subgroup .",
    "as can be easily seen , the update will change the initial configuration in this case , but the resulting markov chain will remain restricted to the abelian sector , without exploring the full space of configurations .    in this work",
    "we propose a modified hb algorithm ( mhb ) in which the generation of the @xmath13 matrix @xmath50 is done as in the hb case , but followed by one final step : _ if the scalar product @xmath51 is positive then one does @xmath52 _ , where the matrix @xmath53 has been defined above .",
    "this may also be thought of as a modification of the overheat - bath ( ohb ) . as said above , the basic idea , in both cases",
    ", is to incorporate a micro - canonical move into the heat - bath step .",
    "the difference is that in our case the direction of @xmath37 is randomly chosen and only its sign is modified , according to the above rule , while in the ohb algorithm one fixes @xmath54 directly .",
    "our modification should ensure ergodicity while keeping the advantage of having a micro - canonical step included into the hb step .",
    "we have indeed verified that the mhb algorithm has no problem with cold starts and shows a better @xmath55 than that of the ohb algorithm for energy - related observables . on the other hand , in the ohb case ,",
    "the move in configuration space is more optimized and the iteration cost is lower , since the algorithm is simpler and it needs fewer random numbers .",
    "our results are presented in the next section .",
    "in order to study the csd of the new algorithm we have to investigate if , and with what exponent , its relaxation time @xmath55 ( for certain quantities we are interested in ) diverges as the lattice size @xmath23 increases . to this end",
    ", we have to evaluate @xmath55 for different lattice sides @xmath23 at `` constant physics '' , namely as the lattice size is increased , the physical size of the lattice should remain fixed .",
    "this is done by introducing a correlation length @xmath56 and by keeping the ratio @xmath57 fixed , with @xmath58 in order to keep finite - size effects under control . for the 1-d @xmath11-vector spin model",
    "one has @xmath59 @xcite , thus one should tune @xmath60 in order to keep the ratio @xmath57 constant . in our simulations we considered the lattice sizes @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in all cases we did @xmath70 thermalization sweeps and for the analysis we discarded the first @xmath71 sweeps .    in order to test the new algorithm we have evaluated the energy density @xmath72 , the magnetization @xmath73 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath74 .",
    "let us recall that there exists an exact solution @xcite for the 1-d @xmath11-vector spin model , even at finite lattice side @xmath23 and with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus , we can check the numerical results for the various quantities against the exact solution ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) ) .    in all cases",
    "we have evaluated the integrated auto - correlation time @xmath6 using an automatic windowing procedure @xcite with two different window factors ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "we also employ a method based on a comparison between the naive statistical error with a binning error @xcite .",
    "we checked that these three estimates are always in agreement .",
    "the error on the integrated auto - correlation time @xmath6 has been evaluated using the madras - sokal formula @xcite .",
    "results are reported in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the data obtained for @xmath6 have been fitted to the ansatz @xmath77 in order to estimate the dynamic critical exponent @xmath78 .",
    "our study shows that the mhb algorithm has essentially the same critical exponent @xmath79 of the standard hb algorithm but the value of the integrated auto - correlation time @xmath55 is about @xmath80 smaller compared to the standard hb algorithm .",
    "this implies a reduction in the statistical error and in the computational cost by a factor of about @xmath81 .",
    "similar results have been obtained in the @xmath13 case @xcite .",
    "thus , a good decorrelation can be reached without the use of multiple micro - canonical sweeps . in particular , from our simulations it appears that the hb algorithm with @xmath40 micro - canonical steps is essentially equivalent to the mhb algorithm with @xmath82 micro - canonical steps .",
    "this feature may be useful in parallel computing @xcite due to the reduction of the inter - node communication .    at the same time , from our data one sees that the mhb algorithm has a critical exponent @xmath9 larger than that of the ohb algorithm . in order to reduce csd for the mhb algorithm , while keeping its ergodicity properties , we are now testing an algorithm that interpolates between mhb and ohb .",
    "a more extensive study of these algorithms , both in the @xmath12 and in the @xmath13 cases , will be presented in a forthcoming work @xcite .     for hb ( @xmath83 ) , ohb ( @xmath84 ) and mhb ( @xmath85 ) , with 0 ( left ) and 1 ( right ) overrelaxation step .",
