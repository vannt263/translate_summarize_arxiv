    "noise storm radio emission from the solar corona is typically manifested as long - lived , broadband noise ( continuum ) radiation at metric / decimetric wavelengths , with occasional short - lived ( 0.11  s ) , intense , narrowband bursts .",
    "the storms are typically observed in the 50 - 500  mhz range , and are brightest around 150 - 200  mhz . at 164  mhz , the peak intensity of noise storm continua is @xmath0 sfu while that of the short bursts is @xmath1 sfu ( malik & mercier 1996 ; kerdraon 1973 ; kerdraon 1979 ) .      aside from solar flares ,",
    "noise storms are the only known sites of electron acceleration in the corona .",
    "estimates of the power budget involved in the electron acceleration process are few and sketchy , and this will be the focus of our paper .",
    "we first turn our attention to the power emitted in noise storm radiation .",
    "elgary ( 1977 ) used the oft - quoted multiwavelength observational study of 28 noise storms conducted by smerd ( 1964 ) to arrive at a figure of @xmath2 for the frequency - integrated energy flux measured at the earth for a typical noise storm .",
    "he then estimated the total noise storm power , @xmath3 , by writing @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the sun - earth distance , @xmath6 is the solid angle through which the radiation is beamed , and @xmath7 is the optical depth of the source . by setting @xmath8 and @xmath9  ster , elgary obtained the canonical result @xmath10 solar noise storm radiation is believed to form via a two - stage process . first , thermal electrons are accelerated to form a nonthermal electron population , and second , the langmuir waves produced by the nonthermal electrons are converted into observable radio emission via coalescence with a suitable population of low - frequency waves .",
    "melrose ( 1975 ) , robinson ( 1978 ) , and wentzel ( 1985 ) have considered the issue of langmuir wave generation by a population of electrons . while any electron population will generate some level of langmuir waves via spontaneous emission",
    ", the production of bright noise storms requires an appreciable power in the langmuir waves .",
    "we have analyzed in a previous paper the evolution of the green s function @xmath11 describing the nonthermal electron distribution resulting from the stochastic acceleration of particles injected with a monoenergetic distribution ( subramanian & becker , 2005 , hereafter paper  1 ) . in a steady - state situation , the green s function is governed by a linear , partial differential fokker - planck transport equation with momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath12 given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a constant with the units of inverse time .",
    "this specific form for @xmath12 is motivated by a number of particle transport scenarios such as the acceleration of electrons by large - scale compressible magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) turbulence ( ptuskin , 1988 ; chandran & maron , 2003 ) ; the energization of electrons by cascading fast - mode waves in flares ( miller , larosa & moore , 1996 ) ; and the acceleration of electrons due to lower hybrid turbulence ( luo et al . , 2003 ) .    the resulting green s function for the nonthermal electron distribution",
    "is found to be ( see paper  1 ; also subramanian , becker , & kazanas , 1999 ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electron momentum , @xmath17 is the momentum of the injected monoenergetic electrons , and the exponents @xmath18 and @xmath19 are given by @xmath20 the quantity @xmath7 in these expressions represents the mean residence time for electrons in the acceleration region , and the normalization parameter @xmath21 is computed using @xmath22 where the constant @xmath23 denotes the number of electrons injected per unit time per unit volume into the acceleration region .",
    "the value of the total electron number density associated with the green s function distribution is given by @xmath24 as expected in this steady - state situation .",
    "since the nonthermal electrons are nonrelativistic with kinetic energy @xmath25 , it follows that we must require @xmath26 in order to avoid an infinite energy density , and therefore @xmath27 .    in paper  1",
    ", we applied the formalism described above to model the transport in momentum space of electrons injected from the high - energy portion of the maxwellian distribution in the corona .",
    "we found that stochastic acceleration of the electrons dominates over losses due to collisions and langmuir damping for particles with momenta @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the `` critical momentum '' in cgs units , @xmath30 is the coulomb logarithm , and @xmath31 represents the total electron number density in the corona .",
    "electrons with @xmath28 experience net acceleration on average , and those with @xmath32 are decelerated on average .",
    "it is expected that a `` gap '' distribution will form as a result of the collisional and langmuir losses experienced by electrons with @xmath32 .",
    "based on analysis of a generic second - order fermi ( stochastic ) acceleration mechanism , we demonstrated in paper  1 that if all of the electrons in the maxwellian distribution with @xmath28 are subject to acceleration , then the nonthermal electron fraction is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the nonthermal electron number density , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the power - law indices given by equations  ( [ neweq3 ] ) , and the dimensionless critical electron energy , @xmath35 , is defined by @xmath36 with @xmath37 denoting the temperature of the thermal electrons , @xmath38 the electron mass , and @xmath39 boltzmann s constant .",
    "the quantities @xmath18 and @xmath40 can be expressed in terms of the high - energy power - law index @xmath19 by using equations  ( [ neweq3 ] ) to write @xmath41 these relations can be combined with equation  ( [ neweq16 ] ) to obtain the alternative result for the nonthermal electron fraction @xmath42 which is convenient because the right - hand side is now an explicit function of @xmath19 and @xmath35 . in paper  1 , both @xmath19 and @xmath43 were treated as free parameters , but in the present paper the second quantity is computed self - consistently using equation  ( [ neweq19 ] ) . hence the only remaining free parameter is @xmath19 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we concentrate here on isotropic electron distributions , in which case the most suitable candidate for producing a sufficiently intense population of langmuir waves is a gap electron distribution ( melrose , 1975 ) .",
    "such a gap distribution is often idealized as a narrow `` hump '' of nonthermal electrons located far above the thermal distribution in the energy space .",
    "melrose ( 1975 ) elaborates on the conditions for the formation of a gap distribution and on the parameters of such a distribution required to ensure a sufficiently intense population of langmuir waves .",
    "the gap is the result of collisional and langmuir losses experienced by particles in the energy range between the typical thermal energy and highly superthermal energies . in a steady state ,",
    "the intensity of the langmuir waves is governed by the balance between emission and absorption of the waves by the thermal and nonthermal electrons .",
    "a gap electron distribution with the right parameters allows superthermal electrons to emit langmuir waves without reabsorbing them , resulting in a high wave intensity .",
    "we now turn our attention to the specific parameters of a gap electron distribution that will enable it to produce a high intensity langmuir wave population , which , in turn , is needed to produce bright noise storm emission .",
    "consider a gap distribution where the nonthermal electrons are peaked around the critical momentum , @xmath44 , given by equation  ( [ neweq6 ] ) . in this case ,",
    "melrose ( 1975 ) points out that in order to form an intense langmuir wave distribution , the number density of the nonthermal electrons must be high enough for them to dominate over the thermal electrons in emitting and absorbing waves with phase velocities @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the `` critical velocity . ''",
    "the phase velocity of the langmuir waves is related to the wavenumber @xmath47 via @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the electron plasma frequency and @xmath50 is the electron charge .",
    "the formation of a high intensity ( or , equivalently , a high brightness temperature ) langmuir wave population requires that the wave damping due to the nonthermal electrons must dominate over that due to the thermal electrons for waves with wavenumber @xmath51 , where @xmath52 in the following analysis , we will concentrate on the constraints imposed by this criterion on the physical mechanism that accelerates the nonthermal electrons with @xmath53 .",
    "based on equation  ( 20 ) from robinson ( 1978 ) , we write the collisional damping rate for the langmuir waves in cgs units as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number density of the thermal electrons , and the value of @xmath56 is independent of the wavenumber @xmath47 . note that the thermal electron number density @xmath55 is essentially equal to the total electron number density @xmath31 appearing in equation  ( [ neweq6 ] ) because only the small population of electrons with @xmath28 in the tail of the maxwellian experiences acceleration .",
    "the wave damping rate due to interactions with the nonthermal electrons in the gap distribution is given by equation  ( 18 ) from robinson ( 1978 ) , which states that @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number density of the nonthermal electrons , and the langmuir frequency , @xmath59 , is given by the dispersion relation ( e.g. , robinson , 1978 ) @xmath60 for electrons with characteristic thermal velocity @xmath61 .",
    "the requirement that the nonthermal electrons dominate over the thermal particles in damping the langmuir waves with @xmath62 can be stated quantitatively as @xmath63 or , equivalently , @xmath64 in cgs units , where we have employed equations  ( [ neweq10 ] ) and ( [ neweq11 ] ) along with the fact that @xmath65 to obtain the final result .",
    "equation  ( [ neweq14 ] ) represents an interesting constraint on the nonthermal electron fraction @xmath43 in the solar corona during the production of the noise storm emission .",
    "the right - hand side of equation  ( [ neweq14 ] ) can be stated in terms of @xmath44 , @xmath37 , and @xmath66 by employing equations  ( [ neweq9 ] ) and ( [ neweq12 ] ) , which yields @xmath67 satisfaction of this inequality ensures that the intensity of the langmuir waves generated by the gap distribution is sufficient to power the observed noise storm emission .",
    "we can use equation  ( [ neweq17 ] ) to reexpress the right - hand side of equation  ( [ neweq15 ] ) in terms of @xmath35 , @xmath66 , and @xmath37 , which yields @xmath68 in cgs units .",

    "the main contribution of this paper lies in the fact that we have self - consistently combined information about the minimum value of @xmath43 with details of the electron acceleration process that were derived in paper  1 . in doing so",

    "the efficiency estimates obtained here therefore represent an improved understanding of the detailed energy budget for the noise storm generation process .",
    "it is interesting to contrast our approach with that taken by thejappa ( 1991 ) .",
    "the model considered here includes an explicit treatment of the acceleration of an isotropic , nonthermal electron distribution based on the associated fokker - planck transport equation analyzed previously in paper  1 .",
    "conversely , thejappa s work focused on the emission of langmuir waves by an anisotropic loss - cone distribution of electrons in the corona , and he did not consider the acceleration of the electrons in the turbulent plasma .",
    "it is therefore suggestive to note that the values we obtain for the nonthermal electron fraction @xmath43 are relatively close to thejappa s results . in the interpretation of thejappa",
    ", it is the _ angular _ anisotropy of the electrons in physical space ( i.e. , the loss - cone distribution ) that provides the basic source of free energy for the production of the langmuir waves .",
    "however , our model utilizes the anisotropy in _ energy _ space ( i.e. , the gap distribution ) as the source of free energy .    in reality",
    ", one would expect both types of anisotropies to coexist , and therefore our results are in some sense complementary to thejappa s .",
    "hence it is important to develop observational diagnostics for both models that can be used to reveal the true nature of the underlying nonthermal electron distribution as a function of both energy and direction . it may be possible to develop the required observational tests by making a detailed analysis of the corresponding predictions for the time - dependent behavior of the associated radio signatures .",
