    "v.v .  sudakov showed@xcite that in the limit of large momentum transfer , i.e. , @xmath4 the most important radiative corrections to the form factor @xmath5 are the double- logarithmic ones ( dl ) .",
    "the summing of these corrections to all orders in @xmath6 leads to , @xmath7 for off - shell momenta @xmath8 and   @xmath9 and to the formula @xmath10 if @xmath11 .    after this pioneer work",
    ", the sudakov form factor @xmath2 was calculated in qcd @xcite and recently it has also been considered in the electroweak ( ew ) theory @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in non - abelian theories",
    "the direct graph - by - graph calculation to all orders in the couplings is a very complicated procedure , even when the double- logarithmic approximation ( dla ) is used .",
    "technically , it is more convenient to use some evolution equation . in particular , the infrared evolution equation ( iree ) approach was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the `` inclusive '' ew sudakov form factor , i.e. , where summation over the left handed lepton flavour was assumed .",
    "the iree method is based on the gribov bremsstrahlung theorem @xcite .",
    "it was applied earlier , in ref .",
    "@xcite , to calculate the radiative form factors for @xmath12 annihilation into quarks and gluons .",
    "it has been proved to be a very efficient and simple method .",
    "this theorem was formulated and proved first for qed and then generalised in refs.@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite to qcd . besides the calculation of the sudakov form factor @xmath13 , the iree turned out to be also useful @xcite in order to calculate the form factor @xmath14 of electrons and quarks in the kinematic region specified by eq.([kin ] ) .",
    "the iree exploits the evolution of the scattering amplitudes with respect to the infrared cut - off @xmath15 introduced in the space of the transverse momenta of virtual particles .",
    "this cut - off plays the role of a mass scale and with dl accuracy all other masses can be safely neglected .",
    "so , in theories with unbroken gauge symmetry it is enough to have one mass scale . on the other hand , for the electroweak theory ,",
    "the @xmath16 symmetry is broken down to the @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "this introduces a second mass parameter , @xmath18 , associated with the symmetry breaking scale .",
    "therefore , besides the conventional dl contributions of the order of @xmath19 in @xmath20-th order of the perturbative expansion , there appear other corrections of the type @xmath21 where @xmath22 are numerical coefficients and @xmath23 runs from 1 to @xmath20 .",
    "since @xmath15 and @xmath18 can be widely different ( we assume the value of @xmath15 to be equal or greater than masses of the involved fermions whereas @xmath18 is comparable with masses of the weak bosons ) , the impact of these two mass scales on the value of the inclusive sudakov form factor can be important . to calculate these contributions to all orders in the electroweak couplings",
    "is the aim of the present work . in sect .",
    "2 we obtain the sudakov form factor for a @xmath24 model with two `` photons '' , using the graph - by - graph calculation . in sect .",
    "3 we derive and solve the iree for the sudakov form factor for the same model .",
    "then , in sect .",
    "4 a similar derivation is made for the sudakov form factor in the electroweak theory .",
    "expressions for the off - shell electroweak sudakov form factor are obtained in sect .",
    "5 . finally , in sect .",
    "6 we summarise and discuss our results .",
    "as a toy model it is instructive to consider a @xmath24 gauge theory . the first group is the normal electro - magnetic gauge group and the second @xmath25 is broken .",
    "the corresponding gauge boson , called @xmath26 meson has a mass @xmath18 .",
    "besides the photon and the @xmath26 meson the model has only one charged fermion , and a neutral scalar higgs particle arising from the spontaneous breaking of the second @xmath25 .    at one loop order the sudakov form factor",
    "is obtained from the diagrams in figure [ fig1 ] where the dashed line represents the photon and the wavy line represents the @xmath26 meson .    summing both contributions in @xmath27 approximation",
    "the result is @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the gauge couplings corresponding to the unbroken and broken groups respectively .",
    "it is interesting to point out that there is also a similar diagram with the higgs particle in loop .",
    "however this contribution vanishes as @xmath30 when the fermion mass , @xmath31 , goes to zero .",
    "this is obviously true in all orders of perturbation theory .    at two loop order",
    "the dl contributions stems from the diagrams of figure fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "+    the calculation of the first four diagrams in fig.[fig2 ] is similar to the qed calculation .",
    "hence , we simply quote the result , @xmath32 ^ 2 + \\frac{1}{2}[(g_2 ^ 2/16 \\pi^2)\\ln^2(q^2/ m^2)]^2.\\ ] ] the calculation of the remaining four diagrams is less trivial .",
    "let us consider diagram @xmath33 , for instance .",
    "it is well known that in dla one can perform the integration over the momenta @xmath34 , @xmath35 , replacing the boson propagators by @xmath36 .",
    "then , using the sudakov parametrisation , @xmath37 it is easy to integrate over @xmath38 and to obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . notice that the @xmath27 arises if one uses the approximation @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this implies @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "these conditions plus the boundaries stemming from the arguments of the @xmath47 functions define the integration region , @xmath48 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show this region .",
    "the full curve corresponds to the equation @xmath49 and the dashed curve represents the condition @xmath50 . because the lower limits of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 integrals are @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , it is easy to see that we are integrating over the rectangle @xmath55 .",
    "so we obtain @xmath56 the integrals are now trivial .",
    "however , rather than doing this it is better to realize that the remaining diagrams give rise to similar integrals but with the integration regions @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , respectively .",
    "then , the sum of the diagrams @xmath33 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 corresponds to @xmath63 which immediately leads to @xmath64    adding these results to eq.([ab ] ) one obtains the total two - loop contribution to the form factor , namely : @xmath65 ^ 2~.\\ ] ] repeating the same analyses in higher orders in @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we would arrive at the simple exponentiation of the double - logarithmic corrections to @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath68 with @xmath69 } .\\ ] ] this equation accounts for all dl contributions described by eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) .",
    "in order to avoid the direct graph - by - graph summation of the dl contributions , it is possible to obtain the sudakov form factor @xmath70 as a solution of some integral equation .",
    "the method of obtaining this infrared evolution equation ( iree ) can be extended in order to include two mass scales , @xmath15 and @xmath18 .",
    "let us first notice that the boson mass @xmath18 in virtual propagators can be regarded in dla as the infrared cut - off for integrating over transverse momentum space for @xmath26-bosons .",
    "in fact , with logarithmic accuracy we have @xmath71 in dla the integrals over the longitudinal momenta have the transverse momenta as the lowest limit .",
    "so , after introducing the cut - off shown in the previous equation one can neglect the mass @xmath18 in the @xmath26-propagators and still be free of infra - red singularities .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath15 is the ir cut - off in the transverse momentum space for photons .",
    "therefore , with the dl accuracy , we have qed with two kinds of photons , each one has an independent infrared cut - off .",
    "we remind the reader that we have assumed that @xmath72 . according to the generalisation@xcite of the gribov bremsstrahlung theorem@xcite",
    ", the boson with the minimal @xmath73 can be factorized , i.e. the main contribution from integrating over its momentum comes from the graphs where its propagator is attached , in all possible ways , to the external charged lines whereas its @xmath73 acts as a new ir cut - off for the integrations over the remaining loop momenta and becomes , in dla , a new effective mass scale .",
    "therefore the blob in fig.[fig4 ] is on - shell .",
    "it depends on the new infrared cut - off @xmath73 and does not depend on the longitudinal components of momentum @xmath23 . however , in contrast to the usual qed situation , now we have two options : the factorized particle with minimal @xmath73 can be either a photon or a @xmath26-boson .",
    "applying the feynman rules to the graph in fig.[fig4 ] , we obtain for the first possibility @xmath74~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 appears as a result of integrating over the longitudinal momentum of the factorized photon quite similarly to the way it appears in the first loop calculation of @xmath2 in qed .",
    "note that the form factors @xmath2 in the right hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ photon ] ) have the same first argument , @xmath76 , but different second arguments , @xmath77 , in the first integral and @xmath76 in the second one .",
    "the reason for this is that the propagators of the @xmath26-bosons depend on @xmath18 through @xmath78 and in dla they are approximated by @xmath79 .",
    "the second possibility is that the factorized particle is the @xmath26-boson .",
    "now , we can regard @xmath18 as the infra - red cut - off for the integration over the @xmath73 of the @xmath26-meson .",
    "hence the result is @xmath80    adding eqs .",
    "( [ photon ] ) and ( [ boson ] ) and including the born contribution , @xmath81 , one obtains the integral iree for the form factor @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath83 the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqf ] ) can be obtained , for example , by iterations : substituting @xmath81 into the integrand of the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eqf ] ) we obtain @xmath82 in the one loop approximation and so on . it is easy to see that , after summing up contributions to all orders , the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eqf ] ) coincides with eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) obtained by the direct graph - by - graph summation . + alternatively , the integral iree given in eq .",
    "( [ eqf ] ) can be rewritten in the differential form ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , differentiating eq .",
    "( [ eqf ] ) with respect to @xmath15 yields @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "obviously the solution is @xmath87 substituting it into eq .",
    "( [ dmu ] ) and differentiating with respect to @xmath88 gives @xmath89 with the boundary condition @xmath90 it is easy to solve this equation .",
    "again one obtains eq.([exp ] )",
    "the fermions in the electroweak theory are such that the left - handed fields are doublets of the weak isospin group and the right handed fields are singlets of @xmath91 .",
    "so one has a left , @xmath92 , and a right , @xmath93 , sudakov form factors . in line with the approximation of massless particles",
    "there is no chirality flip amplitude . because the right - handed fermions couple to the @xmath94 boson , @xmath93 only gets contributions from @xmath95 and photon exchange .",
    "hence , borrowing directly from the results of the previous section , one can easily obtain : @xmath96 with @xmath97~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the weinberg angle .",
    "now , lets us derive the iree for @xmath100 , neglecting the mass difference between the @xmath95 and the @xmath101 boson , i.e. , @xmath102 . to do this ,",
    "applying the gribov bremsstrahlung theorem , one should factorize the boson with the minimal @xmath103 .",
    "if the integration over the @xmath103 of the factorized boson is done in the region @xmath104 this particle can be any of the four bosons present in the theory , the @xmath105 , the @xmath95 and the photon .",
    "this yields the following contribution to the iree : @xmath106 where we have explicitly separated the photon from the @xmath107 contributions .",
    "the latter are proportional to @xmath108.\\ ] ] the second dl region is when @xmath109 , but , now , the integration over the @xmath103 of the factorized boson only gives a dl contribution if this boson is a photon .",
    "so we obtain @xmath110    the sum of the factorized contributions given by eqs.([wz ] ) and ( [ phot ] ) together with the born value @xmath111 leads to the iree for the sudakov form factor @xmath112 in the integral form ,    @xmath113    this equation is similar to eq .",

    "both form factors have to be calculated independently .",
    "obviously , the same is true for the off - shell electroweak sudakov form factor @xmath123 . before we calculate @xmath123 , it is instructive to demonstrate how the iree for the off - shell qed form factor can be obtained .",
    "this form factor @xmath124 depends on @xmath125 and also depend on the infrared cut - off @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath126 .    similarly to the on - shell case",
    ", factorizing the contribution of the virtual photon with the minimal @xmath73 leads to the following iree : @xmath127 however , in contrast to the iree for the on - shell form factor , the region @xmath128 in the previous equation now depends on @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
