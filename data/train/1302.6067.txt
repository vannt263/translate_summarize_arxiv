    "two - dimensional semiconductors have been studied intensively in the past few decades as researchers have tried to find materials to complement or even replace silicon in electronics . a recent trend in the hunt for new two - dimensional systems consists of the isolation and study of atomically thin sheets of layered materials .",
    "honeycomb carbon allotropes have been widely investigated for this purpose following the discovery of graphene @xcite ; hexagonal boron nitride is another example @xcite . with increasing chemical unit cell complexity",
    ", hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides have been exfoliated into atomically thin films using mechanical transfer and liquid - phase sonication @xcite ; many of these materials are semiconductors in both bulk and monolayer phases , making them ideal for use in single - sheet nanoscale optoelectronics @xcite . in this work",
    "we explore the next generation in the family of two - dimensional atomic crystals : stoichiometric layers of gallium chalcogenides ( ga@xmath0x@xmath0 ) .    in the bulk form ,",
    "gas and gase are indirect - gap semiconductors @xcite , with the latter being well - known for its nonlinear optical properties @xcite , while gate is a direct - gap semiconductor used for electrothermal threshold switching @xcite . all three materials exhibit the same structure : they are layered compounds of ga@xmath0x@xmath0 stoichiometry in which each layer consists of two aa - stacked hexagonal sublayers of gallium atoms sandwiched between two hexagonal sublayers of chalcogen atoms ( x ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] . in a bulk material , these layers are bound in a three - dimensional structure by van der waals interactions .    in this work we discuss the optical and electronic properties of single - layer crystals of ga@xmath0s@xmath0 , ga@xmath0se@xmath0 , and ga@xmath0te@xmath0 .",
    "we present the electronic band structures and optical absorption spectra for all three materials . in each case",
    "we find that the band gap is indirect , with the valence - band maximum shifted from the @xmath5 point ( an inverted mexican - hat dispersion ) and the conduction - band minimum ( cbm ) located at the m point in ga@xmath0s@xmath0 and ga@xmath0te@xmath0 , and at the @xmath5 point in ga@xmath0se@xmath0 .",
    "for all three materials we find an unusual , slightly anisotropic mexican - hat shape in the electron dispersion near the edge of the valence band .",
    "however , the strongest peak in the optical absorption spectra  dominated by a transition between two bands with states which are even with respect to @xmath6 symmetry  is not caused by the van hove singularity associated with the mexican - hat spectra , but is provided by two , near - parallel branches in the dispersion of the conduction bands near the brillouin - zone corners k and k@xmath7 .",
    "we also find that hole - doped ga@xmath0x@xmath0 undergoes a lifshitz transition@xcite  a change in the topology of the fermi surface  at hole concentrations @xmath8 @xmath2 , @xmath9 @xmath2 , and @xmath10 @xmath2 .",

    "the band - structure analysis of single - layer ga@xmath0x@xmath0 leading to the above conclusions was performed using density - functional - theory ( dft ) as implemented in the castep @xcite and vasp @xcite plane - wave - basis codes .",
    "tests have shown that the two codes yield nearly indistinguishable results for the materials studied here . to calculate the geometries , phonon dispersions , and optical absorption spectra",
    ", we used semilocal exchange - correlation functionals : the local density approximation ( lda ) and the perdew - burke - ernzerhof @xcite ( pbe ) functionals .",
    "the screened heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof 06 ( hse06 ) functional @xcite was used to obtain the electronic band structures to compensate at least partially for the underestimation of the band gap by semilocal functionals .",

    "we calculated the absorption of graphene using the same method in the 0.81.5 ev energy range where monolayer graphene absorbs 2.3  % of light , and used the calculated graphene absorption intensity to obtain a scaling factor that scales the calculated intensities to the experimental value . since in the case of ga@xmath0s@xmath0 we found disagreement between the pbe and the hse06 regarding the location of the cbm , we restrict ourselves to the lda in the following .",
    "note that the lda results are only qualitatively accurate and should only be used for a comparative study of the different ga@xmath0x@xmath0 monolayers and for an order - of - magnitude estimate of the expected peak positions .",

    "the in - plane absorption is much more significant and is dominated by peaks at around 5 ev/4 ev/3.5 ev for x = s / se / te .",
    "analysis of the band structure reveals that the bulk of this spectrum comes from transitions between the valence band and the @xmath6 even band above the conduction band around the k point where the two bands are near - parallel ( this is the only part in the band structure where the energy difference between a filled and an empty band matches the energy of the main peak ) . in that range ,",
