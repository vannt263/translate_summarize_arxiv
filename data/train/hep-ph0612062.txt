    "the anomalous suppression of the @xmath0 production in heavy ion collisions  experimentally observed @xcite in the depletion of the dilepton multiplicity in the region of invariant mass corresponding to the @xmath0 meson has been proposed long time ago as a possibly unambiguous signal of the onset of deconfinement @xcite .",
    "indeed , in ref .  @xcite it was argued that charmonium states can only be produced in the first instants after the nucleus - nucleus collision , before the formation of a thermalized quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "then , in their path through the deconfined medium , the original @xmath1 bound states tend to melt , since the binding ( colour ) coulomb potential is screened by the large number of colour charges .",
    "this , in turn , would produce an anomalous ( with respect to normal nuclear absorption ) drop in the @xmath0 yields . in this picture",
    "it was implicitly assumed that , once the charmonium dissociates , the heavy quarks hadronize by combining with light quarks only ( recombination leading to a secondary @xmath0 production being neglected ) .    since in hadronic collisions a sizable fraction of the measured @xmath0 s comes from the decay of excited charmonium states ( bottomonium feed - down contribution being negligible at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) conditions ) and the latter",
    "are expected to dissociate at lower temperatures , a mechanism of _ sequential suppression _ has been proposed , with the aim of reproducing the @xmath0 suppression pattern as a function of the energy density reached in the heavy ion collision ( the highest temperatures and energy densities being reached in the most central collisions ) @xcite .    in",
    "all the above mentioned works the reason for charmonium melting in a hot environment was essentially found in the debye screening of the potential among the two color charges . in this",
    "regard one immediately faces a few theoretical problems .",
    "first of all , it is not even clear , at present , whether a temperature - dependent potential can describe medium modifications of quarkonia , although there are efforts aiming to derive a potential at finite temperatures from the underlying qcd ( see , e.  g. , refs .",
    "pragmatically , one can follow a phenomenological approach , building an effective model and testing it against quarkonium properties directly calculated in qcd .",
    "however , even assuming the validity of the potential model at finite temperatures , one has to tackle the problem of finding the appropriate effective screened potential to insert into the schroedinger equation , as it will be discussed below .    indeed ,",
    "when the mechanism of anomalous @xmath0 suppression was originally proposed , lattice calculations could not provide any quantitative estimate of the debye screening length and the authors had to employ a schematic model for the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "nowadays very precise lattice calculations of polyakov line correlators are available , for different numbers of light dynamical fermions @xcite .",
    "it has been known for a long time @xcite that from these correlators it is possible to extract  in hot qcd , as a function of the temperature and of the @xmath2 separation  the change in free energy once a @xmath2 pair is placed in a thermal bath of gluons and light quarks .",
    "the free energy obtained in these calculations , taken in the color singlet channel , has been used as a temperature - dependent potential and inserted into the schroedinger equation in a number of works @xcite .",
    "such a choice turned out to give very low melting temperatures for all the charmonium states : the dissociation temperatures @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite were found for the @xmath0 , all the other charmonium states melting well below @xmath5 .    on the other hand , since the free energy contains an entropy contribution , it was soon realized that employing the change in _ internal _ ( instead of _ free _ ) energy as an effective @xmath2 potential could appear better justified @xcite .",
    "this choice results in a more attractive potential , leading to a melting temperature for the @xmath0 around @xmath6 , the other charmonium states ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) dissociating a bit above @xmath5 .",
    "these findings appear in agreement with ( quenched ) lattice spectral function studies @xcite , at least for what concerns the melting temperatures of charmonia .",
    "lattice results are starting to be available also for the bottomonium spectral function @xcite and for the unquenched case @xcite .",
    "they appear also able to explain the most recent analysis of the na50 ( pb - pb ) , na60 ( in - in ) @xcite and rhic ( au - au ) @xcite data on @xmath0 production , which seems to favour a scenario in which only the excited states of charmonium are anomalously suppressed .",
    "other choices for the effective potential can be found in the literature @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , in particular , the author argues that the internal energy obtained from lattice data through the standard thermodynamical relation contains also a gluon and light quark contribution .",
    "a subtraction procedure is constructed , leading to an effective @xmath2 potential given by a linear combination of the lattice free and internal energies ( normalized to the case with no heavy color sources ) , with temperature dependent coefficients obtained from the qcd equation of state .",
    "results for the quarkonium dissociation temperatures , in potential models based upon lattice data , appear to be consistent with independent lattice results from spectral functions calculations .",
    "indeed , because of the huge numerical effort required by lattice spectral studies , a very fine temperature scan is not available yet .",
    "furthermore , since  as mentioned above  a derivation of the potential model at finite temperature from first principles is still lacking , it would be desirable to test it against other observables .    actually , full information on the fate of the @xmath2 states in thermal equilibrium in a hot environment is encoded , depending upon the channel one is considering , in the meson spectral functions .",
    "the latter can be extracted from the euclidean temporal correlators of mesonic currents ( measured on the lattice ) by inverting an integral transform . such a task",
    "is usually achieved with a technique referred to as maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite and lattice results using this method can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the reliability of mem to extract the spectral functions is not fully established yet , the check of consistency of the potential model has been mainly devoted to a direct comparison with the euclidean correlators in a number of papers @xcite . in these works",
    "the authors , starting from different screened potentials , calculate in a given channel the corresponding charmonium spectral function , which gets contributions both from bound states ( as long as they are supported by the potential ) and ( starting from a threshold energy ) from scattering states . convoluting the spectral function with a thermal kernel",
    ", they eventually obtain the charmonium correlator along the imaginary temporal direction . such a quantity",
    "can then be compared with the ones measured on the lattice . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors point out that this procedure leads to a disagreement between lattice and potential model results .",
    "hence they conclude that a study of the @xmath2 states in the qgp in terms of screened potentials may not be able to catch the right physics . on the other hand ,",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite propose of curing the discrepancy ( at least in the pseudoscalar channel ) by keeping in the continuum part of the potential model spectrum only the resonant contributions , i.  e. by subtracting the free gas states .",
    "we believe that this procedure might be incorrect , since the evaluated correlator has to be compared with the lattice ones , which do have a free gas ( infinite temperature ) limit .",
    "the comparison between lattice data and potential model calculations is usually done by considering a quantity constructed ad hoc , to display the temperature dependence of quarkonium properties , namely the ratio between euclidean correlators above and below the critical temperature ( see next section ) . in a potential model",
    "this ratio turns out to be very sensitive to the treatment of the continuum , e.  g. to the threshold energy .",
    "this is clearly a problem for the calculation of correlators below the critical temperature , since , for instance , at @xmath9 the potential model is based on confining potentials and the continuum spectrum has to be added by hand . secondly , lattice calculations appear to be dominated by finite size artifacts right in the continuum region , leading to unphysical peaks in the spectral functions , even in the infinite temperature limit  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the asymptotic high energy behavior , @xmath10 , of the continuum spectral functions is not reproduced by lattice calculations , since the finite lattice spacing provides an ultraviolet cutoff .    in this paper , following refs .",
    "@xcite , we extract from the lattice data for polyakov line correlators an effective temperature - dependent @xmath2 potential and we use it in order to understand to which extent a comparison with mesonic temporal correlators obtained on the lattice can be pursued . in particular , we study the effect of different models for the continuum and we try to keep under control the uncertainties introduced by the need of calculating correlators below @xmath5 by employing the effective potential derived from lattice data for @xmath11 as well .",
    "we wish to stress how important ( both from a theoretical point of view and for its experimental consequences ) would it be to show that an approach in terms of screened potentials is indeed able to catch the main features of the behavior of quarkonia in a hot environment .",
    "indeed , at present , from finite temperature lattice meson spectral functions one can extract important information on the fate of the ground state in the different quantum number channels , concerning its position , strength and melting temperature . unfortunately , no reliable information can be extracted so far on the excited states , due to the difficulty of disentangling their peaks ( if any ) from lattice artifacts .",
    "although this is not a severe limitation for charmonium studies , where one expects just a few states to ( possibly ) survive after the phase transition ( @xmath0 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 , the latter being the only excited state ) , this is no longer true for the bottomonium .    from the experimental point of view",
    "this turns out to be a strong limitation , especially in view of the alice experiment , where one expects a sizable production of @xmath12 pairs .",
    "in particular the vector channel states will be experimentally accessible through their electromagnetic decays into dilepton pairs @xcite .",
    "moreover , charmonium yields will also get a feed - down contribution from @xmath12 states .",
    "the knowledge of the melting temperature of the different states is then important in order to develop a reliable model of sequential suppression to be eventually compared with the experimental data .    in this regard ,",
    "it is clearly of importance , in view of quantitative studies of bottomonia above @xmath5 , to demonstrate that potential model calculations are consistent with the results obtained from the lattice spectral functions .",
    "although , as we shall see , definite conclusions can not be drawn yet , our work constitutes a promising consistency check of the potential model , given the present status of lattice calculations at finite temperatures .",
    "of course , the final aim should be , on the one hand , to establish a clean theoretical justification of the potential model and , on the other hand , to employ it in the interpretation of the next generation of heavy ion experiments . as a general remark",
    ", we remind the reader that potential model approaches , like the one adopted in this paper , give a _ static _ picture of the behavior of charmonium in the qgp ,",
    "the effects of the interaction with the deconfined quarks and gluons being encoded in the _ screened _ @xmath13 interaction .",
    "alternative pictures are available in the literature , which attempt to predict final charmonium yields in nucleus - nucleus collisions as arising from the interplay of dissociation  recombination processes  @xcite or in the framework of statistical models of hadronization  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : formalism ] we first briefly review the formalism of finite temperature quarkonium spectral functions and imaginary time correlators and then the procedure followed to extract the effective @xmath2 potential from lattice data ; in section  [ sec : results ] we compare the outcome of the potential model to results from lattice calculations , both for the spectral functions and the euclidean correlators ; finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "the standard object introduced in lattice studies of quarkonium properties at finite temperature @xmath14 is the euclidean time correlator , defined as the thermal expectation value of a hadronic current - current correlation function in euclidean time @xmath15 for a given mesonic channel @xmath16 ( see , e.  g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , chap .  7 ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the four vertex operators @xmath23 correspond , respectively , to the scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector mesonic channels , which in turn , at zero temperature , correspond to the @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) quarkonium states for the @xmath1 ( @xmath12 ) system , respectively .",
    "although the correlation functions can in general be defined for any spatial momentum @xmath32 , most lattice studies are restricted to the case @xmath33 and we shall consider , in the following , only this case .    the correlators of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gh ] ) are directly evaluated in lattice qcd , whereas physical observables are related to the spectral function @xmath34 , i.  e. to the imaginary part of the real time retarded correlators .",
    "the two quantities are connected by an integral transform @xmath35 which is regulated by the temperature kernel @xmath36}{\\sinh[\\omega/2t]},\\ ] ] the energy integration extending over the whole spectrum .",
    "extracting the continuous spectral function from the discrete and finite  and usually rather limited  set of lattice data is an ill - posed problem .",
    "it has been tackled through the application of the mem @xcite , which appears to yield promising results , although its reliability has yet to be confirmed .",
    "the mem analysis has been applied by different groups to the @xmath1 system , both below and above the critical temperature and mainly in the quenched approximation ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite for a study in presence of dynamical fermions ) .",
    "the spectral functions obtained in these studies present , schematically , similar features : a well defined peak in correspondence to the ground state meson in a channel of given angular momentum ( @xmath37- or @xmath38-wave ) up to the dissociation temperature ; inability to resolve radial excitations ; presence in the highest part of the spectrum of peaks that are associated to lattice artifacts .",
    "actually , the most meaningful information extracted from the lattice spectral functions concerns the existence and mass value of the lowest quarkonium states at a given temperature .",
    "however , the survival , e.  g. , of the @xmath28 up to temperatures around @xmath39 has important consequences for the interpretation of heavy ion experiments and it has raised the need for a confirmation not suffering from the uncertainties of the mem analysis . a procedure has been devised that makes directly use of the euclidean correlators , by comparing the behavior of the correlators above and below @xmath5 @xcite . specifically , one introduces the ratio between the correlation function @xmath40 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ghs ] ) at a temperature @xmath41 and the so - called _ reconstructed correlator _ @xmath42 calculated using the kernel at @xmath41 and the mem spectral function at some reference temperature @xmath43 .",
    "this procedure should eliminate the trivial temperature dependence due to the kernel and differences from one in the ratio should then be ascribed to the temperature dependence of the spectral function .",
    "furthermore , the mem result for @xmath44  because of the larger number of lattice sites at low temperature  is more robust . on the other hand , at high temperature the correlator is directly measured on the lattice , thus avoiding the extraction of the spectral function with the mem procedure    indeed ,",
    "lattice studies show that the ratio @xmath45 stays around one up to the same dissociation temperatures extracted from the mem analysis and then it departs from one following different patterns in the different channels @xcite .",
    "the other approach followed in the literature in the determination of the quarkonia dissociation temperatures  which is based on the use of effective potentials for the quarkonium systems  has reached similar conclusion about the dissociation temperatures , at least when making use of effective potentials extracted from lattice data on @xmath2 free energies at finite temperature @xcite .    in a potential model approach one",
    "solves the schroedinger equation for a given potential , thus getting not only the spectrum but also the wave functions of the @xmath2 pair .",
    "it is then fairly straightforward to get the corresponding spectral function as the imaginary part of the @xmath2 propagator , namely @xmath46 where @xmath47 represents all the relevant quantum numbers ( in the second line the sum over @xmath47 actually stands for both the sum over discrete states and the integration over the continuum ) and @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the continuum threshold and @xmath50 the eigenvalue associated to the state @xmath51 . in the last line",
    "we have separated the discrete and continuum contributions , introducing the couplings @xmath52 and @xmath53 and the bound state masses @xmath54 ( a normalization of the discrete and continuum states as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , is understood ) .",

    "( [ eq : ghsc ] ) the integration over the excitation energy can reach pretty high values , especially for small @xmath15 s , probing regions where the non - relativistic dispersion relation is no longer valid .",
    "actually , the asymptotic relativistic spectral function @xmath62 that one gets in perturbative qcd is known to be proportional to @xmath63 in every channel , whereas it is easy to check that the non - relativistic solution of the schroedinger equation in the free case goes like , e.  g. , @xmath64 for the @xmath37-states .",
    "the difference is due to the different phase space and it can be accounted for by simply renormalizing the wave function with a phase space factor @xcite . in the calculations discussed below we will be using such wave functions ,",
    "renormalized to account for relativistic kinematical effects",
