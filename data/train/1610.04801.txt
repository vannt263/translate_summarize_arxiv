    "the paradigm of random walks with correlated traps is relevant to many interdisciplinary problems ( random search strategies , exciton trapping by polymer chains , ligand binding to receptors on cell surfaces , foraging patterns , etc . ) , but it is also interesting from the more general perspective of the dynamics of complex systems with correlated disorder  @xcite .",
    "many previous works concerned trapping kinetics for regularly distributed traps  @xcite , some specific types of finite - range correlations and clusters  @xcite , as well as traps distributed with critical ( long - ranged ) positional correlations  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider random walks on a host lattice with spectral dimension @xmath3 ( where diffusion is compact  @xcite ) with correlated imperfect traps forming a proper fractal sublattice .",
    "for such a model , provided that the initial coordinates of random walks are chosen randomly to be at or within a fixed distance of a trap , we found that the survival probability @xmath0 first decays according to stretched exponential kinetics @xmath13 , followed by a transition to power law decay @xmath9 at longer time scales , with the same exponent @xmath14 for both regimes .",
    "the crossover time @xmath15 between the two stages is related to the traps absorption rate @xmath16 by @xmath17 and shrinks to zero in the limit of perfect traps @xmath18 .",
    "thus , for strongly absorbing traps the stretched exponential regime is practically absent and @xmath0 decays according to a power law for all time scales ( except very short ones ) . on the other hand , for weakly absorbing traps ( small @xmath16 ) , both regimes are distinctly present .",
    "the stretched exponential regime is relatively short , lasting only while @xmath0 has not dropped too far ( roughly , less than ten per cent ) from its initial value .",
    "however , the absolute duration of the regime @xmath17 may be significant for a sufficiently small absorption rate @xmath16 .",
    "a particularly interesting instance of this case is when absorption is controlled by a thermally activated reaction , @xmath19 . for a high activation energy @xmath20",
    ", the duration of the stretched exponential regime may hold over several orders of magnitude in time .",
    "we will show that the two - stage long - tailed kinetics of imperfect correlated traps are consistent with known results for regular spatial trap distributions  @xcite , and are different from the most - studied model of perfect uncorrelated traps distributed randomly with relative concentration @xmath21 .",
    "for that model , a good approximation for short time scales is given by the rosenstock mean - field expression  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of distinct sites visited by a walker .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the root - mean - square displacement of the walker @xmath25 , where @xmath8 is the dimension of the random walk .",
    "one recovers stretched exponential relaxation of @xmath0 from ( [ ros ] ) whenever exploration is _ compact _ , i.e. all sites within radius @xmath24 of the origin are visited with equal probability . in that case @xmath26 where @xmath2 and @xmath27 are the space fractal and spectral dimensions , respectively .",
    "then it follows from ( [ ros ] ) and ( [ visits ] ) that the survival probability has the stretched exponential form @xmath28 with @xmath29 and stretching exponent @xmath30 .    at long time scales , instead of the power law kinetics we found for fractally correlated traps , the models with _",
    "uncorrelated _ perfect traps predict stretched exponential decay .",
    "this time , it is due to a more subtle mechanism related to rare spatial fluctuations in the trap distribution . due to the presence of arbitrarily large trap - free regions where the walker can survive for a long time , the survival probability decays slower than exponentially , following a stretched exponential function with stretching exponent @xmath31 for euclidean host lattices  @xcite and @xmath32 for fractals  @xcite .",
    "the same asymptotic behavior was also found to hold for randomly distributed _ imperfect _ traps  @xcite .",
    "while some authors argue that stretched exponential long - time decay due to this mechanism occurs only when @xmath0 drops to extremely low values and thus is not practically observable , more recent simulations show that the mechanism may manifest itself in an experimentally observable range of values of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "thus , one will observe that the survival kinetics of uncorrelated and fractally correlated traps are qualitatively different , for both short and long time scales .",
    "nevertheless , we shall show that the asymptotic behavior of the survival probability @xmath0 for the model with fractally correlated traps can be accounted for by simple heuristic arguments based on the concept of compact exploration , i.e. in a manner not so different from that outlined above for the case of uncorrelated traps .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we formulate the model above in detail and use heuristic arguments to predict that initial relaxation for weakly absorbing traps takes a stretched exponential form . in sections 3 through 6 we verify this prediction for a number of specific systems and discuss relevant simulation techniques , still focusing on the initial relaxation stage in systems with weak traps .",
    "the crossover to power law relaxation for longer time scales and strongly absorbing traps are discussed in section 7 .",
    "some concluding remarks appear in section 8 .",
    "consider a classical particle taking discrete steps at a constant hopping rate @xmath1 between nearest - neighbor sites of a host lattice @xmath33 of dimension @xmath2 , with static imperfect traps interspersed according to a sublattice @xmath34 of dimension @xmath35 .",
    "we characterize the trapping imperfection by a finite _ absorption rate _ @xmath5 , at which the survival probability decays on each trap .",
    "this induces the following master equation for @xmath36 , the probability that the particle is at site @xmath37 at time @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the set of immediate neighbors of @xmath37 .",
    "we shall assume that the _ coordination number _ , i.e. the number of neighbors @xmath41 , is the same for all sites @xmath42 of the host lattice , except those on the boundary . in this case , the master equation takes the form @xmath43 the problem is then to find the survival probability @xmath44    the two characteristic parameters of the problem are the ratio @xmath16 of the absorption and hopping rates , and the the probability @xmath45 that a walker arriving at a trap will be absorbed : @xmath46 the above expression for @xmath45 can be obtained as the probability that absorption occurs before the particle can hop to a neighboring site @xmath47 , where the exponential term gives the ( poissonian ) probability that the particle neither leaves the trap nor is absorbed over the interval @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the probability that absorption occurs in the interval @xmath50 .",
    "the limits of weak and strong absorption correspond to @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "in the simulation we approximate the process described by ( [ master22 ] ) by averaging over discrete random walks with time increment @xmath54 and jumping probability @xmath55 . upon arrival at a trap site ,",
    "the particle is , in its next step , either annihilated with probability @xmath45 , or jumps to one of its @xmath56 neighboring sites , each with probability @xmath57 .    in some special cases the master equation ( [ master22 ] )",
    "is amenable to analytic treatment , particularly in the continuous limit  @xcite .",
    "however for the general case we can glean some insight by using qualitative mean - field arguments , briefly mentioned in the previous section .",
    "first , summing over @xmath37 one obtains from ( [ master ] ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the probability that the particle survived up to moment @xmath38 , and occupies a trap at that moment",
    ". it may be instructive ( particularly for the purpose of simulation ) to define the probabilities @xmath0 and @xmath59 explicitly for an ensemble of @xmath60 particles , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of particles that survived up to moment @xmath38 , and @xmath63 the number of survivors which at that moment occupy a trap .",
    "the above expression for @xmath59 can be also presented as @xmath64 therefore @xmath59 can be written in the form @xmath65 where the function @xmath66 has the meaning of the conditional probability that a particle that survived up to moment @xmath38 occupies a trap . from ( [ exact ] ) and ( [ factorization ] ) one obtains for the survival probability @xmath0 the equation @xmath67 which is still exact but of little help unless one knows the function @xmath68 in an explicit form , or its relation to @xmath0",
    ".    definition ( [ p_exact ] ) suggests a straightforward way to evaluate @xmath68 in a simulation for any absorption rate ; we shall briefly discuss the results of such evaluation at the end of section 7 .",
    "but in fact , for a system with weakly absorbing traps @xmath69 , we can get a simple analytical approximation of @xmath68 by speculating that at sufficiently small time scales one can neglect the effects of absorption on the occupation of traps : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the number of particles occupying traps when the absorption rate is zero . in other words ,",
    "the approximation @xmath72 is the probability of occupying a site on @xmath73 in a system with absorption turned off .",
    "an explicit form of the function @xmath72 is easy to construct for lattices of spectral dimension @xmath74 using a compact exploration argument .",
    "we first suggest that @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the average numbers of distinct sites visited by the particle , in @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively , up to time @xmath38 in a system with @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath81 ( or @xmath82 ) then we ensure that diffusive exploration is compact , and therefore @xmath77 and @xmath76 approximate the average number of sites in @xmath73 and @xmath33 within a radius @xmath83 , i.e.  the root - mean - square displacement of the particle on a trap - free lattice",
    ". this gives @xmath84 substitution of ( [ aux111 ] ) into ( [ p1 ] ) gives for @xmath72 an asymptotic power law @xmath85 then the corresponding solution of ( [ f ] ) @xmath86 has stretched exponential form @xmath87 with @xmath88 , @xmath89 the empirical constant @xmath90 in ( [ f3 ] ) remains undefined , but is expected to be of order of one .",
    "the experimental evidence of such a relaxation would be a linear dependence of @xmath91 versus @xmath92 , with slope @xmath10 .    in order to facilitate comparison with discrete time simulation",
    ", it is convenient to express @xmath16 in terms of the absorption probability @xmath45 . rearranging ( [ gamma ] ) , we obtain @xmath93 . by also taking into account that the time unit in our simulation is @xmath94 , we may then write ( [ f3 ] ) as @xmath95 the empirical constants @xmath90 in eqs .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) and ( [ f3 m ] ) differ by a factor of @xmath96 .",
    "although compact exploration only holds for euclidean lattices when @xmath97 , we shall see in section 6 that our approach still produces a reasonable approximation when @xmath98 . on the other hand , many types of fractals satisfy the condition of @xmath99 . in particular , for random walks on a critical percolation cluster , it holds for any dimension of the embedding lattice  @xcite .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ clear how to extend the above reasoning to the case where @xmath100 , and exploration is no longer compact . we leave this as an open question , and shall not discuss it below .",
    "one expects that the above mechanism of stretched exponential relaxation is limited in both short and long time scales .",
    "on one hand , the mean - field - like expression ( [ p1 ] ) and scaling relations ( [ aux111 ] ) presuppose that the walker has performed many steps , @xmath101 ; the simulations below give an empirical lower bound of between 10 and 100 steps . on the other hand , the above estimation of @xmath68 assumes that the visiting frequency of trapping sites is not affected by annihilation , which implies that @xmath0 must be close to one . from ( [ f3 ] ) one",
    "estimates the upper bound to be @xmath102 .",
    "thus the validity domain of the proposed mechanism for an infinite system is expected to be @xmath103 for a finite system of size @xmath104 , the upper bound is a minimum of @xmath17 and @xmath105 .",
    "we stress again that while the interval ( [ validity ] ) corresponds only to the initial stage of relaxation , the absolute duration of this stage for weakly absorbing traps ( @xmath106 ) may be significant .    for times much larger than @xmath107 , the approximation ( [ p0 ] ) for @xmath68 ceases to be valid , and simulation shows that stretched exponential relaxation",
    "is replaced by power law decay @xmath9 with the same @xmath10 given by ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "we shall postpone detailed discussion of this regime until section 7 .",
    "the previous argument relies on the assumption that traps are weakly absorbing . for strong absorption rates @xmath108 , including the limit of perfect traps @xmath18",
    ", the validity interval ( [ validity ] ) of the stretched exponential regime is inconsistent and , as we shall see , the approximation ( [ p_approx ] ) for @xmath68 is not valid at any time . in this case , as we discuss in section 7 , the stretched exponential regime is absent and @xmath0 , after a short transient period , follows the same power law as for weakly absorbing traps at long time scales .",
    "another restriction on our heuristic argument for the stretched exponential decay of @xmath0 is that the initial location of the walker must be on , or within a fixed distance of , a trap .",
    "otherwise ( e.g. if an initial site is chosen randomly on the host lattice ) the second asymptotic relation in ( [ aux111 ] ) may be invalid .",
    "if the initial distance between the particle and a trap is @xmath109 ( in lattice spacing units ) , then one will expect that the above reasoning starts to work only after the time needed for a walker to reach a trap , @xmath110 . in this case , instead of ( [ validity ] ) one expects a validity interval with a higher lower bound , namely @xmath111hence for the validity interval to be significant we require that @xmath112 , which again can only be a meaningful condition when absorption is weak , @xmath113 .",
    "note that mathematically our model is similar to the class of defect - diffusion models of dipole relaxation , which assume that dipole reorientation ( relaxation ) is triggered by mobile defects  @xcite . in this case",
    "the rate equation for the fraction of surviving dipoles @xmath0 has the form ( [ f ] ) , where @xmath68 is now the diffusive current of defects . if the latter is characterized by power law decay like ( [ p0 ] ) , then this model is formally equivalent to ours .",
    "the two models do , however , employ very different mechanisms to argue power law decay of @xmath68 . in our model",
    "it is due to fractal spatial correlations of traps , whereas in defect - diffusion models it is due to dispersive transport of defects ( in which case @xmath10 is typically temperature - dependent ) .",
    "the difference is also reflected in the fact that the validity range of defect - diffusion models is not restricted by the initial time interval and , when relevant , is capable of describing a much larger section of the relaxation function than the model we discuss here .    as a final note for this section",
    ", we assumed above that the exponent @xmath114 in ( [ p0 ] ) is less than one .",
    "for the special case where @xmath115 , the above reasoning leads , instead of to stretched exponential decay , to a power law @xmath116 with an empirical constant @xmath90 .",
    "as a simple test of the qualitative argument outlined in the previous section , consider the limiting setting when the host lattice is one - dimensional , diffusion is regular , and the trapping sublattice consists of a single trap site : @xmath117 for a weakly absorbing trap we expect the initial relaxation of the survival probability to follow a stretched exponential law with @xmath118 .    if the trap site is at position @xmath119 , then the master equation ( [ master22 ] ) has the form @xmath120 with the initial condition @xmath121 that the particle starts at the initial site @xmath109 , which may coincide with the trap if @xmath122 is finite .",
    "( [ exact ] ) takes the form @xmath123 , and the survival probability is determined by the probability to be on the trap site @xmath124 : @xmath125 this problem is exactly solvable in the continuous limit ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we outline the solution in the appendix and show that over interval ( [ validity_m ] ) , which in this case becomes @xmath126 the survival probability has the approximate form @xmath127 with @xmath128 .",
    "this is consistent with prediction ( [ alpha ] ) : over interval ( [ validity2 ] ) for small @xmath16 , expression ( [ analytic ] ) is a good approximation of the the stretched exponential function with @xmath129 , @xmath130     for random walks on a line with a single trap for different values of the absorption probability @xmath45 .",
    "for all curves , the initial position of the walker coincides with the position of the trap .",

    "1 . according to ( [ ser2 ] ) , a log - log plot of the function @xmath135 , i.e. the plot of @xmath91 versus @xmath136 , must appear to be a straight line with slope given by the exponent @xmath129 .",
    "our simulation confirms this prediction , and shows an increase in the duration of its validity domain for smaller @xmath45 and @xmath16 in a way that is consistent with ( [ validity2 ] ) .",
    "all curves show deviation from stretched exponential relaxation for small @xmath38 when @xmath137 is of order ten .",

    "2 shows similar plots for the same value @xmath133 and different initial positions @xmath141 of the particle . in those cases",
    ", the stretched exponential regime emerges after a transient time which increases quadratically in @xmath109 ; this is in agreement with ( [ validity2 ] ) .",
    "similar results hold for the mathematically equivalent problem of a two - dimensional host lattice with traps on a one - dimensional line : @xmath142 in this case , equation ( [ alpha ] ) predicts stretched exponential relaxation with @xmath129 , and numerical simulation confirms this over the time interval ( [ validity2 ] ) .",
    "the simulations also show agreement with theoretical predictions for other types of simple ( euclidean ) trap configurations embedded in one- and two - dimensional host lattices . in the sections to follow , we consider host and trap lattices with nontrivial fractal dimensions .",
    "we shall now extend the previous example to have traps distributed along a constructive analogue of the cantor set .",
    "we shall refer to the host lattice , together with the traps , as the cantor lattice . in order to simplify the enumeration of trapping sites , in this and the following sections we shall associate hopping sites with lattice cells , rather than the cells end points .    unlike the cantor set , which is defined `` from the outside , in '' by starting from the ( uncountable ) interval @xmath143",

    "3 . the first generation @xmath144 consists of three consecutive cells , the first and last of which are traps .",
    "then we define the @xmath145-th generation recursively to be two copies of @xmath146 flanking a trap - free @xmath146-sized block .",
    "hence each @xmath147 has size @xmath148 and contains @xmath149 traps .",

    "the duration of such an excursion is essentially the time of first return to the absorbing lattice , and assumed to be much larger than the time the particle spends after returning to a trap - rich region .",
    "we show below that this picture leads naturally to the long - time asymptotic behavior of ( [ power ] ) .    in standard fpt problems ,",
    "one seeks to evaluate the fpt distribution @xmath255 , or its moments .",

    "the corresponding equation for laplace transforms ( which we denote by tildes ) reads @xmath264 , so that @xmath265 as was shown in section 2 , the compact exploration argument gives for @xmath72 the asymptotic scaling ( [ p0 ] ) , @xmath266 .",
    "then according to the tauberian theorem  @xcite , @xmath267 for small @xmath268 , and from ( [ f_laplace ] ) one obtains @xmath269 . in the long time domain",
    "this corresponds to power law decay of the fpt distribution , @xmath270 for a single point - like target @xmath271 , @xmath272 , and ( [ fpt ] ) takes the form @xmath273 .",

    "we identify the target network with the trap sublattice and appeal to the above reasoning that on long time - scales the time of absorption is approximately that of the time of first return on the trap sublattice , which is distributed according to ( [ fpt ] ) .",
    "the survival probability @xmath0 is the probability that first passage occurs at @xmath277 , so one immediately recovers the power law ( [ power ] ) , @xmath278 although it is not formally recovered in this derivation , the prefactor @xmath279  which we found experimentally ; see ( [ power ] )  is intuitively to be expected in ( [ power2 ] ) .",
    "one may alternatively seek to account for algebraic asymptotic decay @xmath280 in terms of the conditional probability @xmath68 of occupying a trap ( [ p_exact ] ) .",
    "namely , this behavior can be formally derived as a solution of equation ( [ f ] ) , @xmath281 , when @xmath68 has the form @xmath282 .",
    "indeed , numerical simulation shows that at large time scales there is a crossover from @xmath266 to @xmath283 ; see fig .",
    "we find it difficult , however , to justify or interpret the above ansatz for @xmath68 theoretically , and numerically the function @xmath68 is hard to evaluate ; it quickly becomes very small and , unlike @xmath0 , fluctuates wildly even when evaluated over a very large number of walks .",
    "stretched exponential and power laws are the two most commonly observed heavy - tailed distributions in disordered and complex systems , and for this reason are often believed to originate from very general mechanisms . in particular , power law kinetics are often a signature of continuous - time random walk processes  @xcite characterized by a broad distribution of transition rates or waiting times , and there are several models  @xcite still competing as generic explanations for the origin of stretched exponential kinetics . from this perspective , the emergence of both these distributions within the same conceptually simple model studied in this paper is perhaps remarkable .",
    "we studied the survival probability @xmath0 of random walks in the presence of fractally correlated traps . for imperfect ,",
    "weakly absorbing traps , the initial relaxation of @xmath0 is stretched exponential , followed by power law decay , with both regimes characterized by the same exponent @xmath10 .",
    "the regime of stretched exponential relaxation is shorter for strongly absorbing traps , but may hold over several orders of magnitude in time for weakly absorbing traps . both regimes may be accounted for by arguments based on the concept of compact exploration , applied to evaluate pertinent occupational and first - passage time distributions , for stretched exponential and power law regimes respectively .",
    "we illustrated and verified theoretical predictions with monte carlo simulations for regular host and trap lattices , but we also expect these results for random fractal lattices like critical percolation clusters  @xcite and multidimensional potential landscape structures relevant to complex systems with correlated disorder  @xcite . in the latter case , imperfect correlated traps may correspond to deep potential valley regions separated from the relaxation pathway by a potential ridge .",
    "theoretical arguments employed in the paper imply that the host and trap lattices are infinite , and in the simulation we tried to minimize the effects of boundary conditions .",
    "the enumeration algorithms employed in this paper allow one to simulate random walks on very large fractal structures .",
    "all results presented are for fractals of generation @xmath284 , each consisting of at least @xmath154 units , which we found to be sufficiently large to neglect finite - size effects . for the time scale",
    "considered ( @xmath285 ) , we found empirically that finite size effects become noticeable only for much smaller structures of generation @xmath286 .",
    "while specific forms of finite size effects depend on boundary conditions , we found as a general trend that they make the survival probability @xmath0 decay faster at long times than in an infinite system .",
    "this is intuitively clear , since in an infinite fractal system a particle finds itself , as time progresses , in larger and larger trap - free regions , whereas in a finite system the maximum size of a trap - free region is fixed .",
    "we thank g. buck , j. schnick , s. shea , and j. parodi for discussions and interest , and the anonymous referees for their insightful comments and suggestions .",
    "in this appendix we outline a method for the evaluation of the survival probability @xmath0 for a random walk on a one - dimensional lattice with an imperfect trap located at the origin .",
    "the problem is described by the master equation ( [ master2 ] ) . using the standard laplace and discrete fourier transforms",
    ", one can readily find from that equation the exact expression for the laplace transform of @xmath0 , whose exact inverse however is unknown .",
    "more analytic progress can be achieved by considering , instead of the exact master equation ( [ master2 ] ) , its continuous limit version @xmath287 for the probability density @xmath288 .",
    "this equation follows from ( [ master2 ] ) after replacements @xmath289 , @xmath290 , @xmath291 , and taking the limits @xmath292 and @xmath293 with finite @xmath294 let @xmath295 be a free - diffusion propagator , that is , a solution of the trap - free diffusion equation ( eq .
