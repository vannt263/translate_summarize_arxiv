    "in the last few years , a great deal of effort has been put on the study of topological superconducting systems @xcite because of the possibility of manipulating quantum information in a protected way @xcite .",
    "a possible implementation consists in the realization of an effective ( 1d ) @xmath1-wave superconductor @xcite .",
    "this makes use of a semiconducting wire in the presence of spin - orbit interaction , zeeman fields , and a superconducting order parameter induced by an @xmath0-wave superconductor located in proximity of the nanowire @xcite . in a certain range of parameters ,",
    "the nanowire is predicted to be in a topologically non - trivial phase , exhibiting a pair of majorana bound states ( mbs ) at its ends .",
    "there has been a great deal of work devoted in understanding how mbs could be detected .",
    "smoking gun proofs of the existence of mbs are , for example , the @xmath2 quantization of the conductance  @xcite or the fractional josephson effect with 4@xmath3 periodicity  @xcite .",
    "the experiments performed so far @xcite have measured the differential conductance peak at zero voltage in a two - terminal device .    recently , the opportunity of using a three - terminal setup has been put forward in refs .   in order to reveal the peculiar behavior of andreev bound states ,",
    "which form between two topological superconducting nanowires when a phase bias is applied . in ref .  ,",
    "in particular , additional peculiar features in the spectrum of andreev levels , due to the presence of a third electrode , have been singled out .",
    "it is also possible to look for effects of topological nature in thermoelectrical properties .",

    "the presence of a topological superconductor is not explicit but is taken into account within a low - energy effective theory .    in this work",
    "we study the thermopower of a three - terminal hybrid system focusing on the differences between trivial and topological phases .",
    "we analyze both analytically and numerically a setup composed of a superconducting nanowire attached to two normal leads ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup_simple ] ) and we explore different regimes by varying the parameters of the system . we first consider a simplified continuous 1d model with a single - level qd and a @xmath1-wave ( or @xmath0-wave ) superconducting wire .",
    "we find that the sign of the thermopower for the @xmath1 wave is reversed with respect to the @xmath0 wave for small temperatures .",

    "we find that the energy scale that controls the transition between those behaviors is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the induced superconducting gap and @xmath6 is the coupling to the superconducting lead .",
    "we then consider a more realistic description of the system using a 2d tight - binding model of a nanowire in the presence of zeeman and spin - orbit effects , and @xmath0-wave superconducting coupling . by tuning the parameters one can now explore intermediate regimes between @xmath0-wave- and @xmath1-wave - like superconductivity including the topological phase transition .",
    "numerical simulations confirm the results of the simple model and extend them to more general scenarios such as many - level qd and many - channel normal leads .",
    "the behavior across the topological phase transition is also analyzed .",
    "we complete our study by considering a topological system where one of the two normal leads is removed ( two - terminal setup ) , and nontopological systems in the presence of zero - energy fermionic levels .",

    "for the @xmath0-wave case , the singlet superconducting coupling involves particles and holes of different spin .",
    "since no spin - mixing mechanism exists and no magnetic fields are present , the sector of the hamiltonian relative to spin - up electron and spin - down hole is decoupled from ( and degenerate with ) the sector of spin - down electron and spin - up hole , hence we focus on only one of these two sectors .",
    "since the spin for both electrons and holes is fixed , we drop any reference to the spin of the particles and describe the system as for the @xmath1-wave case except for the @xmath0-wave superconducting coupling .",
