    "the binary representation of a number @xmath6 can be thought of as encoding the unique set of distinct powers of @xmath1 that sum to @xmath6 . for example , @xmath7 we will display binary representations graphically by rendering @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively as @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for reasons that will become clear ,",
    "the convention in this paper when displaying binary representations graphically is to reverse the order of the digits relative to the standard ordering , so that higher indices are to the right .",
    "for example , we write @xmath12 , where the dot identifies the @xmath13 position ( somewhat like a decimal point ) .",
    "the binary representations of the first several powers of @xmath3 grow steadily in length : @xmath14 figure  [ 3n ] displays a grid in which the @xmath15th row contains the binary digits of @xmath0 .",
    "pictures like this were considered by stephen wolfram @xcite . small triangles and other local features can be seen , but overall we get an impression of uniform disorder .",
    "there is no global structure evident , aside from the right boundary of the pattern , which has slope @xmath16 .     in base @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath15th row consists of the binary digits of @xmath0 , in order of increasing exponents . ]",
    "there are some global regularities , however . in particular",
    ", every column is eventually periodic .",
    "this is because there are only finitely many ( in fact @xmath17 ) states that can be assumed by the first @xmath18 columns taken together , so eventually the first @xmath18 columns return to a state that they have reached before , at which point they become periodic .",
    "in fact , each column is not just eventually periodic but periodic from the start .",
    "this is because each row has a unique predecessor , namely the integer obtained by dividing by @xmath3 .",
    "put algebraically , @xmath3 is invertible modulo @xmath17 for every @xmath19 , so from a given row we may compute the previous row to as many bits as we want .",
    "what if we try to compute @xmath18 bits of `` row @xmath20 ''  the predecessor to the initial condition ? certainly we can do this , and the result simply maintains the periodicity of the columns .",
    "we can iteratively compute predecessors and thereby uniquely continue the picture up the page .",
    "figure  [ 3n - history ] shows the end of the unique infinite `` history '' leading up to the initial condition .        for those readers familiar with cellular automata ,",
    "we mention that the ability to evolve the system backward in time is analogous to the same ability in a class of cellular automata whose local rules are bijective functions in the rightmost position . as with multiplying each row by @xmath3 to form the next , information only propagates to the right and is not lost in these automata , and consequently they are reversible under the condition that the left half of each row is determined ( say , all white ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , several themes of the present paper can be carried over to such cellular automata .",
    "but what do the bits in such rows mean ?",
    "rows @xmath21 in the history illustrated in figure  [ 3n - history ] do not represent integers , since they contain @xmath9s in positions arbitrarily far to the right : the sum used to compute the value of such a row diverges . for example , row @xmath20 represents the `` infinite integer '' @xmath22 however , formally applying the geometric series formula to this divergent series produces @xmath23 which is certainly a natural object for row @xmath24 to correspond to .",
    "similarly , row @xmath25 represents @xmath26 this is our first mystery , and in fact for each @xmath21 there is a divergent series which produces @xmath0 under invalid applications of the geometric series formula .",
    "[ divergent ] each power @xmath0 for @xmath21 is the `` sum '' of a divergent series .    in order to resolve this mystery we must first encounter several additional mysteries",
    " all related to the first  regarding the binary representation of @xmath0 .",
    "since there are only two cell values ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) in figure  [ 3n ] , the period length of each column is a power of @xmath1 .",
    "( in fact for @xmath27 the period length of @xmath28 is @xmath29 . ) therefore , another consequence of the column periodicity is that row @xmath30 resembles the initial condition in several bits , since the periods of the first several columns will have just started over .",
    "brenton bostick brought this `` local nestedness '' to my attention at the midwest nks conference in 2005 .",
    "for example @xmath31 agrees with the initial condition @xmath32 to three places to the right of the @xmath13 position .",
    "other terms in the subsequence @xmath2 agree with the initial condition to more places : @xmath33 figure  [ 32n ] shows many more rows , each row truncated at @xmath34 bits ; the image can be efficiently produced with the following _ mathematica _ code .",
    "the large triangular region of white cells indicates a sort of convergence to the initial condition : the farther down we go in this image , the more columns have stabilized to the first bit in their period  the bit in row @xmath8 .",
    "as figure  [ 32n ] shows , each column ( except the leftmost column ) eventually becomes white , because row @xmath8 is simply @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , @xmath2 `` converges '' bitwise to @xmath9 as @xmath36 .    .",
    "the @xmath15th row contains the first @xmath34 bits of @xmath2 . ]",
    "this can be proven by euler s theorem , which states that if @xmath37 is coprime to @xmath38 then @xmath39 , where the euler totient function @xmath40 is the number of integers @xmath41 that are relatively prime to @xmath38 .",
    "it is not difficult to convince oneself that if @xmath4 is prime then @xmath42 . in our case",
    ", letting @xmath43 and @xmath44 gives @xmath45 .",
    "letting @xmath36 shows that every bit in @xmath2 eventually approaches the corresponding bit of @xmath9 .",
    "perhaps we feel a little uneasy about giving much credence to this convergence , because certainly @xmath2 gets very large and far away from @xmath9 as @xmath15 gets large .",
    "thus we record it as another mystery .",
    "[ limit ] @xmath46 .    in figure  [ 32n ]",
    "we see additional structure as well  surprising diagonal lines above the white triangular region .",
    "more diagonals are filled in as we go down the page , so there appears to be another bitwise - convergent sequence here . to change the diagonal lines into vertical lines ,",
    "we make the first column white ( for uniformity ) and shear the image ( shifting each row one position left relative to the row above it ) . the result is shown as figure  [ 32n - sheared ] .",
    "indeed these ( shifted ) rows are converging bitwise to something  the row @xmath47 the shearing operation can also be effected by shifting the @xmath15th row left by @xmath15 bits ; in other words , divide the @xmath15th row by @xmath30 .",
    "we may therefore write @xmath48    , sheared so that the diagonal lines are now vertical . ]    in figure  [ 32n - sheared ] we also observe some secondary diagonal structures that were not easily visible before .",
    "they are not as demarcated as the first set and seem to be interacting with the complex background . in order to make the secondary diagonals vertical",
    "we would like to perform the same shearing operation .",
    "however , first we need to subtract the limiting pattern @xmath49 from each row . but subtract it how ?",
    "the limit is a divergent `` infinite integer '' , but forming an integer from the first @xmath18 bits of @xmath49 and subtracting this integer from each row clears all the corresponding equal bits .",
    "once we have subtracted the limit , we divide by @xmath30 to remove the @xmath15 bits of @xmath8s on row @xmath15 .",
    "this produces figure  [ 32n - shearedagain ] , in which the secondary diagonals are no longer muddied by the background but produce a clear limiting pattern themselves .",
    "the new limit is @xmath50    , obtained from @xmath2 by twice subtracting the limit and shearing . ]",
    "it is natural to let @xmath51 be the first limit .",
    "if we continue to iterate this subtract - and - shear operation we continue to find convergent sequences of rows .",
    "this means that , despite the apparent complexity in bits of @xmath2 , every region can be decomposed into a sum of simple periodic regions .",
    "the next limit @xmath52 satisfies @xmath53 let us take this expression and unravel it to see the structure better .",
    "we find @xmath54 as @xmath36 .",
    "replacing @xmath30 with @xmath55 reveals that this is a power series : @xmath56 of course , we know a power series for @xmath57 , namely @xmath58 so we might conjecture that @xmath59 .    for @xmath60",
    "we indeed have @xmath61 .",
    "but for @xmath62 the conjecture seems to fail , because @xmath49 is not a real number but an `` infinite integer '' .",
    "( in any case , the bits of @xmath49 do nt resemble the binary representation of the real number @xmath63 . )",
    "[ log3 ] `` @xmath64 '' is not the real number @xmath64 .",
    "a final observation we make is that the direction of convergence is opposite that of real numbers .",
    "all the sequences we have seen approach their limits by filling in bits from low indices to high indices , which is toward the right in our graphical convention of reversing the digits of integers .",
    "a convergent sequence of real numbers , on the other hand , fills in bits from high indices to low indices .",
    "take the sequence @xmath65 , for example .",
    "some terms of this sequence ( as real numbers ) are shown in figure  [ e ] .",
    "the convergence proceeds from left to right , which is the same graphical direction but opposite numerical direction as the convergence of the sequence @xmath2 in figure  [ 32n ] .     as real numbers , with most significant bits on the left .",
    "the terms are slowly converging to @xmath66 . ]    in the setting of bits of @xmath2 , then , the low indices of a number are somehow stronger than the higher indices .",
    "therefore we should really think of the `` tail '' of numbers as being backward from the normal sense : in this mode of convergence , two numbers are close to each other if their leftmost bits agree  if their difference is divisible by a large power of @xmath1 .",
    "this is why we have chosen the convention that higher indices are to the right .",
    "[ close ] two numbers are close if their difference is highly divisible by @xmath1 .",
    "our four mysteries suggest that there is a notion of number presenting itself through the binary representation of @xmath2 that is quite different from the real numbers . from mystery  [ close ] we must conclude that in some sense @xmath67 gets small as @xmath68 gets large , and the other mysteries support this conclusion .",
    "let us therefore make this a _ definition _ instead of a mystery and introduce a new notion of `` size '' to make this precise .",
    "every rational number @xmath69 has a representation @xmath70 for integers @xmath71 , @xmath15 , and @xmath72 , where @xmath15 and @xmath72 are not divisible by @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , @xmath71 is unique .",
    "we want @xmath73 to be large when @xmath71 is small and small ( but positive ) when @xmath71 is large .",
    "a natural choice is to let @xmath74 ; this is called the _ @xmath1-adic norm _ of @xmath75 .",
    "for example , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath8 is very highly divisible by @xmath1 , let us define @xmath78 .",
    "since large powers @xmath67 are small in the @xmath1-adic norm , a rational number can be a sum of arbitrarily large powers of @xmath1 when thought of @xmath1-adically , just as it can be a sum of arbitrarily large powers of @xmath79 when thought of as a real number .",
    "for example , @xmath80    in fact , every rational number has the representation @xmath81 for some integer @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "for example , @xmath20 is rendered @xmath1-adically as @xmath84 which illustrates that the @xmath1-adic representation of a number is really a `` limit '' of its representations modulo @xmath17 as @xmath85 . for finite @xmath18 , the representation modulo @xmath17 of course",
    "coincides with its two s complement representation .",
    "in general , @xmath18 bits of the @xmath1-adic representation of a rational number @xmath70 can be found by computing the inverse @xmath86 , which is an integer , and multiplying by @xmath87 .",
    "one can check that the @xmath1-adic norm induces a metric @xmath88 on the rational numbers , akin to the usual metric induced by the absolute value .",
    "in particular , it satisfies the triangle inequality @xmath89 .",
    "there are some strange properties of this metric , however .",
    "perhaps the most immediate is that every triangle is isosceles : if @xmath90 , then the triangle is isosceles by definition . on the other hand , if @xmath91 , then @xmath92 for example , if @xmath93 and @xmath94 then @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    "naturally , we write @xmath97 if the sequence of @xmath1-adic norms @xmath98 approaches @xmath8 as @xmath36 . so indeed @xmath99 in the @xmath1-adic metric .    of course , when we take a limit of rational numbers we may not get another rational number .",
    "traditionally , the real numbers can be constructed by taking limits of rationals with respect to the real metric ; each real number has an expansion @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "similarly , we can take limits of rationals with respect to the @xmath1-adic metric and get a different completion of the rationals .",
    "this completion is called the _ set of @xmath1-adic numbers _ , and each @xmath1-adic number has a representation @xmath81 , where again @xmath101 . like the real numbers , this set is complete  it contains all its limit points .",
    "it turns out that our power series @xmath102 is correct , but it must be interpreted not as a real power series but as a @xmath1-adic power series .",
    "this means that `` @xmath64 '' is not the real number @xmath64 but the @xmath1-adic number @xmath64 .",
    "how do we compute it ?",
    "the function @xmath103 has a @xmath1-adic power series that coincides with its real power series : @xmath104 of course , in the real metric this power series diverges at @xmath105 , so it can not be used to compute the real @xmath64 .",
    "but @xmath1-adically this series converges at @xmath105 to the @xmath1-adic @xmath106 .",
    "similarly , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and so on .    to be precise , one must of course establish the standard objects of calculus over the @xmath1-adic numbers  derivatives , power series , tests for convergence , etc .",
    "we do not undertake this task here but refer the reader to texts on the subject .",
    "the book of gouva @xcite serves as a solid introduction , and koblitz @xcite provides a more advanced treatment .",
    "the results of the previous section can be generalized in several directions , and we discover that the power series structure we have seen is quite common .",
    "euler s theorem tells us that there is nothing particularly special about @xmath2 , and in fact @xmath109 and @xmath110 have exactly analogous structures in binary , as shown in the first row of figure  [ otherpowers ] . in general ,",
    "if @xmath37 is odd then @xmath111 has a @xmath1-adic power series @xmath112 .",
    "gouva ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.5 ) discusses the region of convergence of such power series .",
    "what about other bases @xmath113 ? the second and third rows of figure  [ otherpowers ] show several examples . to address these cases",
    "we briefly generalize the discussion to @xmath4-adic numbers for prime @xmath4 .",
    "of course we may define @xmath114 for general @xmath38 ( prime or composite ) in the analogous way . for primes",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath115 is a norm on the set of rational numbers . for composite @xmath38",
    "it is not since in general @xmath116 ; for example , @xmath117 .",
    "in fact , it is a theorem of ostrowski that the @xmath4-adic norms and the real norm are ( up to equivalence ) the only nontrivial norms on the set of rational numbers .    evidently @xmath118 in the @xmath3-adic metric .",
    "however , the @xmath3-adic limit of @xmath119 is not @xmath9 but @xmath120 . for general @xmath37",
    "relatively prime to @xmath4 , euler s theorem provides that @xmath121 . in the limit ,",
    "then , @xmath5 approaches a @xmath122th root of unity @xmath123 . this root of unity is congruent to @xmath37 modulo @xmath4 and is called the _ teichmller representative _ of @xmath37 .",
    "this accounts for the vertical stripes in the base-@xmath124 digits of @xmath125 and @xmath126 ; the @xmath124-adic fourth roots of unity congruent to @xmath1 and @xmath3 modulo @xmath124 are irrational .",
    "note also that @xmath127 .    the @xmath4-adic power series of functions @xmath128 other than @xmath111 are also evident in the base-@xmath4 digits of @xmath129 .",
    "let @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 be the sequences of fibonacci , catalan , motzkin , and bell numbers .",

    "the terms of the sequence @xmath143 , of course , become highly divisible by @xmath1 , so @xmath144 in the @xmath1-adic norm .",
