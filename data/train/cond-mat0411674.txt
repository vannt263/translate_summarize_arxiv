    "<S> measurements of the magnetic field penetration depth @xmath0 in the pyrochlore superconductor rbos@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath3  k ) were carried out by means of the muon - spin - rotation ( @xmath4sr ) technique . at low temperatures @xmath5 saturates and becomes constant below @xmath6 , in agreement with what is expected for weak - coupled s - wave bcs superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath0 at @xmath7 was found to be in the range of 250  nm to 300  nm . @xmath4sr and equilibrium magnetization measurements both reveal that at low temperatures @xmath0 is almost ( at the level of 10% ) independent of the applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests that the superconducting energy gap in rbos@xmath1o@xmath2 is isotropic . </S>"
