    "the conversion of molecular gas into stars and planets can for simplicity be conceptually divided into four stages : ( 1 ) the fragmentation of clouds into large scale structures ( filaments / ribbons ) ; ( 2 ) the formation of dense cores within these large structures ; ( 3 ) core collapse to form a hydrostatic protostar ; ( 4 ) disk formation and evolution leading to outflows , multiplicity , planets , etc . in this review",

    "if molecular clouds are assembled from these subcritical components , then the observed star formation in the clouds leads to two possibilities : ( 1 ) the molecular clouds are entirely supercritical , having been assembled from a sufficient amount of subcritical material , by motions along galactic magnetic field lines ; ( 2 ) the molecular clouds are largely subcritical but that the breakdown of flux freezing due to ambipolar diffusion allows subregions to become subcritical and produce dense cores . the first scenario places challenging demands on the accumulation length of matter in molecular clouds , and also on the speed of streaming motions along the magnetic field ( ( * ?",
