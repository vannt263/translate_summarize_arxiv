    "the last few years have witnessed considerable advances in our understanding of the structure of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) predicted by cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated cosmologies .",
    "several groups have performed a series of combined numerical @xmath16-body/ hydrodynamics simulations of structure formation in the igm ( cen 1994 ; zhang , anninos , & norman 1995 ; hernquist 1996 ) , that are converging on a definite picture for the origin of the forest in a cdm universe .",
    "although some differences between the simulations remain to be resolved , the general landscape the simulations have drawn is one of an interconnected network of sheets and filaments , with dwarfish spheroidal systems , essentially minihalos ( rees 1986 ; ikeuchi 1986 ) , located at their points of intersection , and fluctuations within low density regions between . the filamentary structure bears a remarkable resemblance to the findings of similar simulations for the formation of rich clusters of galaxies ( bryan 1994 ) .",
    "bond , kofman , & pogosyan ( 1996 ) have argued that this `` cosmic web '' is a generic feature of cdm , a consequence of an inchoate pattern in the matter fluctuations imprinted at the epoch of matter  radiation decoupling and sharpened by gravitational instability .",
    "the distribution in neutral hydrogen column densities along lines  of  sight piercing the filaments , as well as the distribution of the velocity widths of the resulting absorption features , are found to coincide closely with the measurements of the forest in the spectra of high redshift quasars ( miralda - escud 1996 ; dav 1997 ; zhang 1997 ; wadsley & bond 1997 ) .    ever since the pioneering survey of sargent ( 1980 ) , observational studies of the forest have targeted several key issues concerning the structure of the absorbers :  1 .  what is the physical state of the clouds ?  2 .",
    "what is the confinement mechanism of the clouds ?  3 .",
    "how do the clouds evolve ?  4 .",
    "what are their shapes and physical extent ?  5 .",
    "how do the clouds fit into scenarios for the formation of large  scale structure ? following the identification of the absorption lines in qso spectra as intergalactic clouds by lynds ( 1971 ) , arons ( 1972 ) attributed the absorption to the hydrogen in intervening protogalaxies photoionized by a qso  dominated uv background .",
    "the essential confinement mechanism in this scenario is the gravity of the protogalaxy .",
    "sargent ( 1980 ) suggested an alternative model in which the absorption arises from intergalactic gas clouds confined by a hot ambient igm .",
    "following their lead , ostriker & ikeuchi ( 1983 ) and ikeuchi & ostriker ( 1986 ) formulated a theory of pressure confined clouds that permitted definite predictions to be made for the observed properties of the absorbers and their evolution and for the properties of the hot confining medium . shortly thereafter",
    ", the successes of the cdm model created an interest in combining this theory of large scale structure formation with the formation of clouds into a single unified picture . in this scenario ,",
    "clouds can either be associated with bound structures , stabilized by the gravity of dark matter mini ",
    "halos ( rees 1986 , 1988 ; ikeuchi 1986 ) , or with post",
    " photoionized unconfined gas in low mass objects that developed from small mass fluctuations ( bond , szalay , and silk 1988 ) .",
    "subsequent discussions of the structure and evolution of the clouds included a link to dwarf galaxy formation ( ikeuchi & norman 1987 ; ikeuchi , murakami , & rees 1988 ) , the effect of environment on minihalos ( murakami & ikeuchi 1994 ) , and slab models for the clouds ( mcgill 1990 ; charlton , salpeter , & hogan 1993 ; miralda  escud & rees 1993 ; meiksin 1994 ) .",
    "parallel to the investigations of the forest has been a closely allied effort to study the structure of a smoothly distributed diffuse intergalactic gas component .",
    "soon after the identification of the first qso , gunn & peterson ( 1965 ) recognized that its spectrum could be used to place a stringent constraint on the number density of neutral hydrogen in the igm by measuring the amount of absorption shortward of the emission line of the qso .",
    "the absence of a strong absorption trough led them to conclude that the neutral hydrogen density of the igm is so low that the igm must be highly ionized .",
    "the detection of such a component would have important consequences for cosmology . since a lower limit to the amount of metagalactic ionizing radiation is provided by the contribution due to qso sources , a measurement of the opacity of a smooth component could be used to determine a lower bound to the total hydrogen density of the igm , assuming the igm is in photoionization equilibrium .",
    "this density would be directly comparable to the prediction of big bang nucleosynthesis . in order to estimate the opacity of the smooth component , however , it is crucial first to remove the contribution to the absorption due to the forest ( steidel & sargent 1987 ; jenkins & ostriker 1991 ) .",
    "the total density of the diffuse gas may be derived only if its filling factor is known , which , following gunn & peterson ( 1965 ) , was implicitly assumed to be unity . for a clumped component like the forest , the filling factor is not directly amenable to measurements . to date",
    "there has been no definitive detection of a smoothly distributed component of neutral hydrogen .",
    "measurements have been made of the amount of absorption by intergalactic ( jakobsen 1994 ; davidsen 1996 ; hogan 1997 ) , but again it appears possible to account for the absorption entirely by the forest ( madau & meiksin 1994 ; songaila , hu , & cowie 1995 ; giroux , fardal , & shull 1995 ) .    in this paper , we address these questions using the results of our recent numerical hydrodynamics simulations of the formation of the forest in standard cdm ( scdm ) . in a companion paper , zhang ( 1997 ) ,",
    "we presented an analysis of synthetic spectra constructed from the simulation results .",
    "there we found excellent agreement between the model column density distribution over the range @xmath17 and the observed spectra from the keck hires and from previous high spectral resolution studies .",
    "we also showed the underlying distribution of doppler parameters agrees closely with the distribution inferred from observations .",
    "we found that agreement with measurements of the intergalactic absorption required a fairly soft uv background , but one still compatible with qsos as the dominant radiation sources . in this paper , we concentrate on the physical structure of the clouds .",
    "we make some comparisons with the results from alternative schemes for solving the hydrodynamics .",
    "the calculations of hernquist ( 1996 ) , haehnelt ( 1996 ) , and wadsley & bond ( 1997 ) were performed using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , in contrast to the more traditional grid  based code we have adopted .",
    "cen ( 1994 ) performed a @xmath18cdm simulation using a grid  based code , though with a different treatment of the hydrodynamics based on a total variation dimininishing scheme ( tvd ) .",
    "we also provide a detailed discussion of a topic that has not received much previous attention , the structure within small underdense regions , minivoids .",
    "we shall argue that an understanding of the fine  structure of the minivoids is essential for interpreting measurements of the opacity of the igm , both of hydrogen and especially of singly ionized helium .    in  [ sec :",
    "sim ] we briefly describe our numerical method and simulations . in ",
    "[ sec : physical ] we describe the physical properties of the absorption systems , and relate these to their absorption properties .",
    "we discuss the origin of the absorption in the underdense regions in  [ sec : minivoids ] and its observational consequences .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the simulations were performed using our 2level hierarchical grid code hercules ( anninos , norman , & clarke 1994 ; anninos 1997 ) . the simulation box had a comoving side of 9.6 mpc .",
    "most of the analysis presented here is for the top grid . to explore the effects of grid resolution , we take advantage of the 2level nature of our code and introduce a second , more finely resolved ,",
    "subgrid to cover a section of the coarser top grid .",
    "we use @xmath19 cells on both the top and subgrids , and @xmath19 particles to represent the dark matter .",
    "the subgrid is centered on the _ least _ dense region of the top grid for the purpose of resolving in greater detail the fine density structure of the voids .",
    "the subgrid is a factor of 4 greater in resolution .",
    "thus , the top grid has a comoving resolution of 75 kpc and the subgrid of 18.75 kpc .",
    "the dark matter particles have a mass of @xmath20 in the top grid , and @xmath21 in the subgrid .",
    "our model background spacetime is a flat , cold dark matter dominated universe with the initial density perturbations originating from inflation  inspired adiabatic fluctuations .",
    "we assume a hubble constant @xmath1 .",
    "the bbks ( bardeen 1986 ) transfer function is employed with the standard harrison ",
    "zeldovich power spectrum , normalized to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , consistent with the present number density and temperatures of galaxy clusters ( white , efstathiou , & frenk 1993 ; bond & myers 1996 ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath24 , consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis limits ( copi , schramm , & turner 1995 ) , and the baryonic fluid is composed of hydrogen and helium in primordial abundance with a hydrogen mass fraction of 76% .",
    "we generate the initial particle positions and perturbations using the cosmological initial conditions and microwave anisotropy codes ( cosmics , bertschinger 1995 ) .",
    "in addition to the usual ingredients of baryonic and dark matter , we also solve the coupled system of non  equilibrium chemical reactions with radiative cooling .",
    "the reaction network includes a self  consistent treatment of the following six species : , , , , and @xmath25 .",
    "details of the chemical model , cooling rates and numerical methods can be found in abel ( 1997 ) and anninos ( 1997 ) .",
    "we include a uniform uv photoionizing background , adopting the estimate of haardt & madau ( 1996 ) for a qso - dominated uv background .",
    "we turn on the radiation field at @xmath26 .",
    "it is unlikely that the regions from qso sources would have percolated before this time ( meiksin & madau 1993 ) , though it is possible the igm was reionized earlier by other sources like an early generation of stars or decaying neutrinos .",
    "the evolution of systems sufficiently dense as to be in photoionization thermal equilibrium are not expected to be much affected by the turn on time of the radiation field by @xmath27 , but more rarefied systems may be sensitive to the reionization history ( meiksin 1994 ) . the topic merits further investigation .",
    "we do not incorporate radiative transfer through the gas , as the clouds we are most interested in have column densities @xmath28 .",
    "radiative transfer of the ionizing radiation becomes significant for column densities a factor of several above this .",
    "for , radiative transfer is just starting to become important for this column density , so that we may slightly overestimate the temperatures of the higher column density systems , but the dynamics should be essentially unaltered at our resolution . we adopt the fits to the photoionization rates from haardt & madau ( 1996 ) , and the fits to their results for the heating rates presented in zhang ( 1997 ) .",
    "since the cloud temperatures are not very sensitive to the assumed heating rate , we note that comparisons of our current results with alternative radiation fields or cosmic baryon densities may be made by simply rescaling the ionization fractions using the ratio of parameters @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the photoionization rate for the species of interest , in units of @xmath31 .",
    "this is a valid procedure provided the regions have not undergone significant recombination into neutral hydrogen or neutral or singly ionized helium , in which case the accompanying change in the temperatures of the clouds can have a non",
    " negligible effect on the cloud dynamics and structure .. ]",
    "the cloud population is characterized by a range of morphologies .",
    "the highest column density systems tend to be associated with physically more dense and compact structures , similar to the minihalo model .",
    "these spheroidal systems are interconnected by a network of sheets and filaments .",
    "it is these structures that are responsible for most of the traditional forest , with column densities in the range @xmath32 . in between the filaments",
    "are underdense regions .",
    "even though underdense , these regions give rise to discrete absorption systems as well . because the underlying physical origin of these systems appears distinct from those above , and because of its relevance to the detection of a smooth diffuse igm component , we defer a more complete discussion of the systems in the underdense regions until the following section .",
    "although no unique attribute suffices to describe the full range of morphologies exhibited by the clouds , systems of a given baryon overdensity are associated with distinctive shapes and configurations . in plate 1 , we show the configurations enclosed by 3d isodensity contours at @xmath33 . at low densities ( first panel , @xmath34 ) ,",
    "the contours enclose isolated amorphous regions .",
    "these lie at the centers of minivoids , underdense regions a few ( comoving ) megaparsecs across , as shown in the second and third panels ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "the systems corresponding to the cosmological average density ( @xmath37 ) , in the fourth panel show a cell  like or spongy morphology , with underdense regions separated by wall  like partitions of varying thicknesses .",
    "the next panel ( @xmath38 ) , shows a filamentary network emerging from the intersections of the walls .",
    "the network , or cosmic web , is prominent in the final panel ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we have provided an accompanying video that more vividly displays the transitions between the various morphologies and their interrelations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cont_z3 ] , we show two dimensional contour plots of the baryons and the dark matter , as well as the baryonic temperature and peculiar velocity divergence , at @xmath33 .",
    "three  dimensional representations of the results from this and an earlier simulation ( zhang 1996 ) , are available at our www site @xmath40 , and in norman ( 1996 ) .",
    "the plots in figure [ fig : cont_z3 ] show a slice with a width @xmath41 of the box size .",
    "there are obvious morphological distinctions between the high and low density structures . the high overdense structures ( thick solid lines ) , are typically isolated objects with an elongated or spheroidal baryon distribution .",
    "the baryon distribution closely follows the dark matter distribution .",
    "typical thicknesses of the structures are @xmath42 kpc , though the baryons show coherence over scales as great as a megaparsec .",
    "both the baryons and the dark matter show alignments in their isolated structures over megaparsec scales , defining a network of sheets and filaments .",
    "the intermediate density absorbers ( solid and dashed lines ) , are associated mainly with the filaments or sheets themselves .",
    "the negative peculiar velocity divergence of these systems shows that they are still undergoing gravitational collapse .",
    "the lowest density clouds arise in the underdense ( @xmath43 ) , minivoids between the filaments .",
    "the underdense absorbers ( dotted lines ) , tend to be irregular in shape and have no preferred direction as in the case of the filaments and sheets .",
    "they typically have temperatures lower than the equilibrium temperature of @xmath44  k and a positive peculiar velocity divergence , indicating that these regions are expanding with respect to the hubble flow .",
    "there is a general correspondence between high ( low ) overdensities , high ( low ) temperatures , and large ( small ) negative peculiar velocity divergences .",
    "the corresponding and column density contours are shown in figure [ fig : cont_col ] .",
    "a comparison with figure [ fig : cont_z3 ] shows a clear correlation between column density and overdensity .",
    "the high column density absorbers ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) correspond to the highly overdense structures ( @xmath47 ) residing mostly along and at the intersections of filaments . the medium column density absorbers ( @xmath48 for and @xmath49 for )",
    "correspond to the modestly overdense filaments ( @xmath50 )",
    ". the column density can be coherent over the scale of a few megaparsecs at this level .",
    "the lowest column density absorbers ( @xmath51 for and @xmath52 for ) are associated with underdense structures ( @xmath53 ) and are located in the void regions between the filamentary structures .",
    "they are typically a few hundred kiloparsecs across .",
    "an evolutionary sequence is shown in figure [ fig : rho_evol ] of the baryonic overdensity over the redshift range @xmath6 to z@xmath54 .",
    "superimposed is the peculiar velocity field projected onto the plane of the slice .",
    "as the universe evolves towards the lower redshifts , the average density decreases due to cosmic expansion , yet the structures remain nearly constant in morphology .",
    "there is some indication that the filaments sharpen with time , and that the dense regions at the intersections become more dense , but by and large the principal structures are in place by @xmath6 .",
    "the simulations show that once in place , the sheets and filaments maintain a nearly constant overdensity with time .",
    "by contrast , the collapse of a halo is apparent along the lower left side of the plot .",
    "the halo is at the center of a strongly convergent velocity flow , and continues to accrete material from the surrounding underdense regions and from along the filaments throughout the simulation .",
    "a pancake is visible slightly offset to the right from the center of the figure , at an oblique angle .",
    "the continual collapse of material onto the pancake is indicated by the velocity field , which is nearly perpendicular to the pancake surface .",
    "notice the flow along the elongated structures leading into the pancake as well , as is especially clear in the figure at @xmath33 and @xmath55 .",
    "the general pattern is one of outflow from the minivoids , compression into sheets at the boundaries of the voids , and a resulting flow along the sheets toward their intersections .",
    "the underdense regions themselves are not uniform , but reveal small  scale mottling and striations .",
    "all these structures give rise to discrete absorption features in our synthesized spectra .",
    "the slow evolution of the baryon density is reflected by the distribution of the baryon overdensity , shown in figure [ fig : odb_distr ] .",
    "the mode of the distribution shifts to lower values as the underdense regions continue to vacate , resulting in a broadening of the overall distribution . for comparison",
    ", we show the evolution of the dark matter overdensity distribution in figure [ fig : oddm_distr ] .",
    "theoretical considerations suggest that the density distribution should be approximately lognormal ( coles & jones 1991 ; colombi 1994 ) .",
    "we find that a lognormal distribution fits both the baryon and the dark matter overdensity distributions moderately well , as was similarly found for the cell occupation densities in the simulations of coles , melott , & shandarin ( 1993 ) .",
    "both distributions , however , have pronounced high density tails , so that the probability distribution of the rarer overdense structures is distinctly not lognormal . at low densities ,",
    "the baryon density distribution cuts off more sharply than a lognormal distribution , while the dark matter distribution shows a broad wing that is also not lognormal .",
    "the constancy of the baryonic overdensity in the sheets is an expected consequence of pancake collapse .",
    "the computations of meiksin ( 1994 ) for the collapse of photoionized gas into slabs show that a weak counterflow develops after the formation of a caustic in the dark matter distribution and the subsequent diminishing of the gravitational potential of the slab .",
    "this outflow meets the larger inflow in an accretion shock , the position of which moves outward from the slab center .",
    "the result is a baryonic density within the slab that decreases nearly in proportion to the cosmic average density .",
    "the decrease in baryon density is reflected by a rapid decrease in the column density of the slab . in figure [ fig :",
    "nhi_evol ] , we show the evolution of the column density in the simulation .",
    "a consequence of the evolution is that the universe becomes more transparent with time .",
    "the number of systems detected along a given line  of  sight above a fixed column density threshold decreases toward decreasing redshift , at a rate consistent with observations ( zhang 1997 ) . the contours , _ at the same fixed levels _",
    ", become less connected and the sheets and filaments become less extended in space . despite this general contraction ,",
    "the _ total _ number of lines actually increases per unit redshift at lower redshifts as the comoving scale increases for a fixed redshift interval ( zhang 1997 , figure 12 ) .",
    "a strong correlation exists not only between baryon density and column density , but between temperature , peculiar velocity divergence , and the ratio of dark matter to baryonic overdensities as well . in figure",
    "[ fig : corr_nhi ] we show scatter plots of these quantities , along with the average and median dependences on @xmath56 .",
    "( also see zhang 1997 ; meiksin 1997 ) .",
    "similar correlations were found for a @xmath18cdm model ( miralda - escud 1996 ) .",
    "the temperature of the baryons varies over the range of about 5000 k in expanding regions to over @xmath57 k in strongly collapsing regions .",
    "most of the gas mass is in photoionization thermal equilibrium with the ionizing background , and so has a characteristic temperature of @xmath58 , as shown in figure [ fig : cont_z3 ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : stat_mul]a we show a line plot across the densest structure on the top grid of the 9.6 mpc simulation at redshift @xmath33 .",
    "the temperature in most of the cells is elevated to about @xmath59 due to photoionization heating by the uv radiation background .",
    "the densest structures on the grid have a typical caustic  like shape , i.e. the outskirts of the collapsing gas are shock  heated to more than @xmath60 due to the infalling gas , while the center of the structure is radiatively  cooled ( mostly by hydrogen line cooling ) to the hydrogen recombination determined temperature of @xmath61 .",
    "similar structures were found in the simulations of cen ( 1994 ) . the gas is completely ionized except in the center  most regions of the densest structures .",
    "typical fractional abundances of and are roughly @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively . however , at the centers of the densest structures , hydrogen and helium have mostly recombined to their neutral forms .",
    "figure [ fig : stat_mul]b shows the corresponding line plot across the densest cell in the sub grid simulation . because the subgrid is positioned over the most _ underdense _ void region of the top grid , the temperatures of the densest structures found on the subgrid are typically lower than those on the top grid .",
    "the high temperatures ( @xmath64 ) found are readily explained by gravitational infall .",
    "gas falling into a deep potential well will be shock  heated to the effective virial temperature of the potential well , only to relax to the photoionization equilibrium value downstream .",
    "low temperatures ( @xmath65 ) , however , are also found .",
    "these occur in low density regions , where the density of the baryons is too low for the gas to maintain equilibrium at the photoionization temperature against the expansion of the gas .",
    "this effect was discussed by meiksin ( 1994 ) , where it was shown that when the gas density falls below @xmath66 for @xmath67 in an otherwise quiescient region , the expansion of the gas will drive it out of photoionization thermal equilibrium , resulting in a temperature below the equilibrium value .",
    "the reason is that the rate of energy deposition per baryon by photoionization is proportional to the and fractions , which decline with decreasing total baryon density .",
    "since the energy of the photoejected electrons must be shared with all the baryons , the rate of energy deposition per particle by the radiation field is diminished in lower density regions . for densities",
    "@xmath68 , the energy deposition rate lags behind the cooling rate due to cosmic expansion .",
    "a consequence of this effect is that the temperature of the low column density systems will be sensitive to the assumed average baryon density and to the ionization history of the igm .",
    "as the universe evolves , a greater fraction of the baryons are heated to high temperatures by compression as more massive systems continue to collapse . at the same time",
    ", the baryons in the underdense regions continue to cool through adiabatic expansion .",
    "the result , shown in figure [ fig : temp_distr ] , is a progressive flattening of the temperature distribution with time .",
    "we may use the correlations in figure [ fig : corr_nhi ] to derive several key properties of the absorbers .",
    "because of the correlation between density and column density , the neutral hydrogen fraction will be correlated with the column density as well",
    ". this relation may be used to derive the distribution of baryons within the forest as a function of column density ( see the following section ) .",
    "a cloud with an internal density @xmath4 that is optically thin at the lyman edge and in ionization equilibrium with the metagalactic radiation field will have a neutral hydrogen density of @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the cosmic mean baryon density , here taken to correspond to @xmath71 .",
    "the temperature factor is due to the temperature dependence of the radiatiave recombination rate .",
    "figure [ fig : corr_nhi ] shows that , in the column density range @xmath72 , the internal cloud density varies with column density as @xmath73 at @xmath33 , where @xmath74 is the column density in units of @xmath75 .    a direct consequence of the square ",
    "root dependence of the cloud density on column density over the range @xmath72 is that the clouds in this range must all have nearly the same characteristic dimension .",
    "taking the line  of  sight total scale length of the absorbers to be @xmath76 , we find from eq.([eq : nhi ] ) and @xmath73 that @xmath77 , with a weak dependence on column density through the cloud temperature .",
    "the associated characteristic cloud baryonic masses are @xmath78 , or greater allowing for the elongation into filaments .",
    "the inferred sizes are close to the typical filament widths shown in figure [ fig : cont_z3 ] , and are consistent with the results of the double line  of  sight analysis performed by charlton ( 1997 ) .",
    "it is also close to the scale height expected on dimensional grounds for photoionized gas in hydrostatic equilibrium within the potential well of a moderate dark matter overdensity . for a given dark matter",
    "overdensity @xmath79 , the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for an isothermal gas , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the isothermal sound speed , and introducing a scaleheight @xmath82 , becomes @xmath83 , where we have expressed the gravitational potential ( up to an additive constant ) , as @xmath84 .",
    "we then obtain for a typical total thickness @xmath85 for @xmath86 . from eq.([eq : nhi ] ) , and taking the overdensity in baryons to be comparable to that in the dark matter , the typical column densities of the moderately overdense systems is then @xmath32 , consistent with figure [ fig : corr_nhi ] .",
    "we may compare this with the minihalo model , for which the baryonic overdensities of the halo cores will reach the higher values of @xmath87 due to spheroidal collapse and cooling ( meiksin 1994 ) .",
    "the typical sizes of these systems will be a few kiloparsecs , and the corresponding column densities and baryonic masses will be @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "these systems correspond to the nodes of the filaments in figure [ fig : cont_z3 ] , though their internal structure is likely not fully resolved in the simulation .",
    "we anticipate studying these structures in greater detail using future higher resolution simulations .",
    "some of the statistical properties of the forest have recently been shown to be derivable from a few basic physical assumptions .",
    "bi & davidsen ( 1997 ) are able to reproduce results in good agreement with the observed cloud properties over the column density range @xmath32 starting with a lognormal distribution for the baryon density , and a suitably adjusted cloud scale length . the differences between the true distributions and a lognormal ( figures [ fig : odb_distr ] and [ fig : oddm_distr ] ) , though , will necessarily introduce a bias in the normalization of the column density distribution and the inferred value of the cosmological baryon density .",
    "hui , gnedin , & zhang ( 1996 ) are able to obtain a very good match to the column density distribution and doppler parameters in the simulations using a semianalytic approach based on the truncated zeldovich approximation ( coles 1993 ) .",
    "the agreement with the fully self  consistent hydrodynamical calculations offers the promise of using semianalytic methods to infer the effect of variations in the cosmological models on the dominant statistical properties of the forest .",
    "recently it has become possible to place constraints on the ionization parameters of the forest systems by measuring the column densities of various ionization stages of carbon and silicon .",
    "using the keck hires , and assuming a cloud temperature determined by the balance of photoeletric heating and radiative losses , songaila & cowie ( 1996 ) inferred a typical ionization parameter for clouds at @xmath90 with @xmath91 of @xmath92 , with most clouds falling in the range @xmath93 .",
    "the ionization parameter is defined to be @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the number density of hydrogen ionizing photons in the ambient radiation field , and @xmath96 is the total number density of hydrogen atoms .",
    "the best fitting models require a large break in the uv background at the photoelectric edge , in keeping with the break required by our simulation to reproduce the measurements of the intergalactic opacity ( zhang 1997 ) . by comparing the pair of column density ratios : and : , they concluded that silicon must be enriched relative to carbon by a factor of a few to several above the solar abundance ratio , consistent with evidence for a high abundance of @xmath97processed material found in some damped systems at high redshift ( lu 1997 ) .",
    "the ionization parameter scaling with the cosmic mean density and the intensity of the uv ionizing background differs by a factor of @xmath9 from @xmath98 , giving @xmath99 .",
    "this breaks the degeneracy between the baryon density and the intensity of the radiation field in @xmath98 alone . combining the normalization requirement of the mean intergalactic opacity , which fixes @xmath98 , with the metal absorption line ratios , which fixes @xmath100 , it is possible to constrain @xmath9 and @xmath95 ( or @xmath101 ) separately",
    "this is somewhat complicated by the spectral shape of the uv background , in particular the size of the spectral break between the and photoelectric edges .",
    "measurements of the mean opacity , however , provide a stringent constraint on the size of the break ( jakobsen et al .",
    "1994 ; madau & meiksin 1994 ) . based on our spectral analysis ( zhang 1997 )",

    "decreasing the minimum forces the distribution @xmath158 to turn down at increasingly larger values of @xmath159 .",

    "we thus conclude that the full spectral opacity distribution @xmath149 may be accounted for entirely by line blanketing due to discrete absorption systems with voigt line profiles .",
    "if a smoothly distributed , homogeneously expanding component were present , the spectral opacity distribution would cut off abruptly at the opacity corresponding to its density .",

    "we believe it illuminating to distinguish these systems from the remainder of the forest for several reasons :  1 .",
    "we find considerable structure in the underdense regions , more than can be accounted for by the jeans instability .",
    "2 .  the systems are diffuse , and hence behave similarly to a smooth igm component in their averaged absorption properties , but not identically to one .",
    "3 .  the recent and anticipated space  based detections of intergalactic essentially are probes of the fine structure of the minivoids . since the current and near  term detectors are not generally capable of resolving individual absorption systems , a discussion of the underlying physical properties of the clouds in the underdense regions is crucial for interpreting future measurements in the context of cdm and reionization models .",
    "critical to the discussion is establishing convergence to the correct amount of absorption . without adequate resolution of the structures giving rise to the absorption , the amount of absorption will be over  estimated .",

    "the optically thin systems are not equilibrium structures :  their density is dissipating at a rate in excess of the average cosmic expansion . in principle",
    ", low column density gas could be associated with low mass minihalos . bond ( 1988 ) demonstrated that the baryons bound to low mass minihalos prior to reionization may be reheated to temperatures too high for the minihalos to retain the gas after reionization , and the baryons will escape . while this must occur for some systems , a comparison with the dark matter overdensity for the optically thin features in figures [ fig : corr_nhi ] and [ fig : spechi_od ]",
    "show that these systems are generally not associated with minihalos , since the dark matter fluctuations themselves are below the cosmic average .",

    "<S> we discuss the origin and physical nature of the forest absorption systems as found in hydrodynamical simulations of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in a standard cold dark matter cosmology ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the structures of the systems that give rise to the forest span a wide range in morphologies , depending on the density contrast . </S>",
    "<S> highly overdense systems , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes baryon density , tend to be spheroidal and are located at the intersections of an interconnecting network of filaments of moderate overdensity , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the typical thickness of the filaments is 100 kpc , with a typical length of a few megaparsecs . at the cosmological average density , </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic morphology is cell  like with underdense regions separated by overdense sheet  like partitions . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest density contours tend to enclose amorphous , isolated regions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the principal structures of the igm are in place by @xmath6 , with the evolution in the igm absorption properties due primarily to the expansion of the universe and the changing intensity of the photoionizing background radiation field . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption properties of the forest clouds correlate strongly with those of the underlying physical systems from which they arise . </S>",
    "<S> the highest column density systems ( @xmath7 ) , correspond to the highly overdense spheroidal structures , moderate column density systems ( @xmath8 ) , correspond to the filaments , and the lowest density absorption systems originate from discrete fluctuations within underdense regions a few megaparsecs across , cosmic minivoids . </S>",
    "<S> most of the intergalactic opacity arises from these underdense regions . </S>",
    "<S> similar correlations are found for the cloud temperature and divergence of the peculiar velocity field . within the uncertainties of the statistics of the derived forest properties , we are able to account for the distribution of optical depths in our synthesized spectra entirely by absorption due to discrete systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find that virtually all the baryons in the simulation fragment into structures that we can identify with discrete absorption lines , with at most 5% remaining in a smoothly distributed component ( the gunn  </S>",
    "<S> peterson effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with the cloud ionization parameters inferred from keck hires measurements of carbon and silicon in the forest . combining with constraints imposed by measurements of the mean intergalactic opacity permits separate limits to be set on the mean cosmological baryon density @xmath9 and ionization rate @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> for the cosmological model investigated , we find @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , at @xmath14 . our results for the amount of intergalactic and absorption and for the ionization parameters of the clouds are consistent with a forest photoionized by a uv background dominated by qso sources with an intrinsic spectral index of @xmath15 .    </S>",
