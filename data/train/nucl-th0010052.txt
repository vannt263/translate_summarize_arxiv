    "almost all the carbon in the universe is produced through the triple - alpha process @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath1be nucleus , formed in the collision of two alpha particles ( @xmath2he ) , is unbound , it lives long enough to allow the possibility of capturing a third alpha particle to form stable @xmath3c .",
    "however , in order to produce enough carbon , this second reaction must be resonant @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 state of @xmath3c , lying at 380 kev , relative to the @xmath5 threshold , therefore plays a key role in the synthesis of carbon .",
    "as both steps of the triple - alpha process are governed by narrow resonances , the reaction rate is given as @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mass and the number density of the alpha particles , respectively , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the resonance energy and radiative width of the @xmath4 state of @xmath3c , respectively , and @xmath11 is the stellar plasma temperature .",
    "as the rate of the triple - alpha process is exponentially sensitive to the resonance energy , even small changes in @xmath9 can lead to big changes in @xmath12 .",
    "we studied how much @xmath9 can change if the strength of the n - n force is varied by a small amount . for this purpose",
    "we used a cluster - model description of @xmath3c @xcite .",
    "we performed calculations using four different n - n forces , mhn , mn , v1 , and v2 @xcite .",
    "each force was tuned to give the experimental value for @xmath9 .",
    "then the strengths of the forces were multiplied by a factor @xmath13 , which varied from 0.996 to 1.004 .",
    "thus @xmath14 gives back the experimental resonance energy .",
    "the @xmath9 energies as functions of @xmath13 are shown in fig .  1 .    [ fig1 ]",
    "state of @xmath3c as a function of the strength parameter of the n - n forces.,width=302 ]    one can see that small changes ( less than 1% ) in the interaction strength lead to orders of magnitude bigger changes in the resonance energy .",
    "this effect is caused by the fact that the @xmath4 state lies close to the breakup threshold , effectively behaving as a nonlinear quantum amplifier @xcite .    as one",
    "can see in fig .  1 , the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath13 has a force dependence .",
    "its origin can be traced back to the fact that the different interactions lead to different residual alpha - alpha forces , which is the key quantity in the nonlinear amplification phenomenon @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath4 state of @xmath3c is correctly reproduced , then the resonance in the @xmath1be subsystem is underbound by the mhn force , while it is successively more and more overbound by mn , v1 , and v2 .",
    "this means that from the viewpoint of the @xmath3c state , the residual @xmath15 force is too strong for mhn , and increasingly too weak for mn , v1 , and v2 ( e.g. , in the case of an mhn force which reproduces the correct @xmath1be energy , the @xmath3c state would be overbound ) .",
    "this implies that the true behavior of @xmath9 as a function of @xmath13 is expected to be somewhere between the predictions of the mhn and mn forces .    using the predictions of the mhn and mn forces",
    ", we calculated the @xmath12 rates for the modified interactions , and used these rates in a stellar model @xcite in order to estimate the carbon and oxygen abundances @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  2 .    ) and oxygen ( @xmath16 ) mass abundances ( @xmath17 ) through variations of the strength of the strong interaction .",
    "they are shown in panels a , b , and c for stars with masses of 20 , 5 , and @xmath18 , respectively , in units of the standard values @xmath19 .",
    "the variations of the strength of the strong interaction are given for the two effective n - n forces mhn and mn .",
    "the dashed curves are drawn to guide the eye.,width=529 ]    as one can see , the amount of carbon ( oxygen ) synthesized in any star is strongly reduced if the n - n force is weaker ( stronger ) than the standard case .",
    "one can see in fig .  2 that a 0.5% change in the n - n interaction strength would lead to a universe which does not contain an appreciable amount of carbon or oxygen .",
    "this would make the existence of carbon - based life highly unlikely .",
    "this very strong fine - tuning effect gives us a possibility to try to constrain the possible values of some fundamental constants in the standard model .",
    "for example , if one assumes a pion - exchange model of the strong force , then the a smaller ( larger ) pion mass means a stronger ( weaker ) force .",
    "more detailed analyses show that our result on the fine - tuning of carbon and oxygen production can be used to give constraints on the possible values of the sum of the light quark masses and the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field at the 1% level @xcite",
