    "self - assembled quantum dots ( qds ) , also known as artificial atoms , are made of millions of atoms .",
    "@xcite unlike real atoms , which have constant physical properties , the qds are different from each other and show far more complicate behavior . the physical properties of qds , are determined by the combined effects of the strain distributions , alloy , interface etc .",
    ", which are coined during their growing process .",
    "it is a great challenge , as well as an opportunity , to tune the qds to desired properties ( e.g. , the exciton energy , polarization , and fine structure splitting etc . ) by external fields , which is not only interesting for fundamental physics , but is also extremely important for device applications .",
    "however , despite the importance , our understanding to the interplay between the qds and external fields is still very limited .",
    "one of the most prominent applications of qds is as the entangled photon emitters , based on the biexciton cascade process , @xcite which has attracted enormous interest in the last decade . however , though it is simple in principle , it is not easy to implement experimentally .",
    "this is because of the existence of in - plane anisotropy in the qds , the two biexciton decay pathways may have a small energy difference known as the fine structure splitting ( fss ) .",
    "when the fss exceeds the radiative linewidth ( @xmath0 1.0 @xmath1ev ) , the polarization entanglement will be destroyed.@xcite great effort has been made to reduce the fss using various post - growth tuning techniques.@xcite especially , it has recently been demonstrated that the fss can be universally suppressed through the combination of electric field and stresses,@xcite regardless of the dots details .    in previous works , we have developed an effective model  @xcite based on symmetry analysis to explain how the fss change under external stress .",
    "it turns out that the results obtained from the simple effective model is in excellent agreement with those obtained from a more sophisticated empirical pseudopotential method ( epm ) @xcite and configuration interaction ( ci ) calculations @xcite and as well as the experimental results .",
    "@xcite however , there is a hug gap between the effective model and the epm calculations in understanding how exactly the strain modify the exciton coupling in the qds at microscopic level .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to bridge the gap between the effective model and the pseudopotential calculations .",
    "we derive analytically the exciton fss under the external stresses in self - assembled inas / gaas qds using the bir - pikus model.@xcite we show that the strain induced valence bands mixing and valence - conduction bands ( vb - cb ) coupling play the most important roles in tuning the fss .",
    "detailed comparison between the bir - pikus model and the epm calculations shows that the simple bir - pikus model provides semi - quantitatively description of the fss under strain .",
    "we further clarify the polarization angle change under the external stresses .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : single - particle ] , we discuss how the single - particle states of a qd vary under the external stresses using the bir - pikus model .",
    "we discuss how the electron - hole exchange integrals and fss change under the external stresses in sec .",

    "[ sec : polarization ] .",
    "we summarize in sec . [",
    "sec : summary ] .",
    "we first look at how the single particle states in a qd vary under external strain field .",
    "usually the applied uniaxial stress is less than @xmath2 100 mpa . under such small stress ,",
    "the shape of qds changes very little .",
    "we therefore neglect the change of envelope functions of the single particle states , and focus on the underlying atomistic wave functions .",
    "we further assume that dots have uniformly distributed strain due to the lattice mismatch between the inas dot and gaas matrix , and neglect the interface effects for the moment .",
    "the influence of strain on valence states in zinc - blende structures can be described by the bir - pikus model.@xcite we expand the bir - pikus hamiltonian with in the six @xmath3 states , i.e. , heavy hole ( hh ) @xmath4 , light hole ( lh ) @xmath5 and spin orbital ( so ) @xmath6 states , resulting in the following @xmath7 matrix , @xmath8 where , @xmath9 @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the isotropic , biaxial , and shear deformation potentials respectively and @xmath13 are the strain components in the qds . @xmath14 describes the effects of isotropic hydrostatic strain and @xmath15 is associated with the biaxial strain .",
    "the effects of in - plane and off - plane strain anisotropy are accounted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in self - assembled inas",
    "/ gaas qds grown on the ( 001 ) gaas substrate , the dot material is compressed in the growth plane and distended in the growth direction .",
    "we also consider the effects of strain anisotropy in the growth plane ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) and off - plane shear strains ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .    for most iii - v semiconductors , the so bands are several hundreds mev below the hh and lh bands .",
    "the so band were ignored in many previous works.@xcite however , for self - assembled ingaas / gaas qds and other nano - structures with large lattice mismatch , the biaxial strain is very large , which push the lh bands down towards the so bands , therefore the coupling to the so band is also important , as will be demonstrated in this work .",
    "therefore , the full hamiltonian should also includes the so coupling term , @xmath22 here , @xmath23 390 mev is the so parameter in inas .",
    "the total hamiltonian is given by @xmath24 .",
    "because of the large lattice mismatch ( 7% ) between inas and gaas in the inas / gaas qds , the biaxial strain ( @xmath25 24% ) is much larger than the shear strains ( @xmath26 1 % , @xmath27% ) . as a consequence , @xmath15 is comparable with the so parameter @xmath28 , much larger than @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , we treat @xmath16 and @xmath17 as perturbations in the hamiltonian .",
    "we calculate the first two ( degenerate ) hole states states up to second order of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 1 is the normalization factor .",
    "the single - particle energy of the two states is , @xmath34 these two states are still dominated by the hh ( @xmath35 ) states but mixing up with some lh and so components .",
    "there are are two mixing mechanisms : ( i ) the mixing between hh and @xmath36 states of the opposite signs is mainly due to the in - plane anisotropic strain effects or shape asymmetry ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the mixing amplitude is determined by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "( ii ) the mixing between hh and @xmath36 states with the same sign is mainly due to the off - plane shear strain components ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the mixing amplitude is determined by @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "both mixing mechanisms have important influence on the optical properties of the qds , which will be discussed later in the paper .    for the simplicity of the discussion",
    ", we ignore the vb - cb coupling for a moment .",
    "but we will see later that the vb - cb coupling is also important for the fss change under stain , which is addressed in the appendix .",
    "the bloch parts of the conduction states are dominated by the lowest electron bands , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the energy of conduction states merely depends on hydrostatic strain : @xmath43    under external stresses , the strain distribution in qds changes accordingly , which changes the single - particle energy levels , as well as the coupling between the hh , lh and so bands .",
    "we take the uniaxial stress along the [ 110 ] direction for example .",
    "the relation between the change of strain and stress @xmath44 along the [ 110 ] direction is given by , @xmath45 here , we take the compressive stress as positive one , and the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 in the bir - pikus hamiltonian under stress along the [ 110 ] direction can be written as , @xmath46 interestingly , @xmath17 does not change with the stress along the [ 110 ] direction .",
    "we have @xmath47 and @xmath48 because the envelope functions of the electron and hole states change little , if the external stress is not very large , the direct electron - hole coulomb interaction also change little .",
    "the change of the exciton energy is therefore mainly determined by the single - particle energies .",
    "we can estimate the of energy change to the stress along [ 110 ] direction as , @xmath49 using the deformation potential parameters for bulk inas material and elastic compliance constants for bulk gaas material listed in table [ tab : param ] , we obtain @xmath50 12.3 @xmath1ev / mpa .",
    "this value is in consistent with recent experimental results .",
    "@xcite although the exciton energy can be tuned by the stress along [ 110 ] direction , the tuning slope is rather small , because of the cancellation effect between the conduction band and valence bands in eq .",
