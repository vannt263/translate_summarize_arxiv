    "as one of the most intriguing fields in nuclear physics with available heavy ion beams , the exploration of resonant structure especially from an alpha - clustering perspective in light nuclei has attracted much attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "measurements in inverse kinematics , for instance , were made to determine the exotic structure or decay mode of the compound nuclei @xmath10f , @xmath10ne , @xmath11c , @xmath0n @xcite . for the @xmath0b nucleus , which was identified as an alpha - clustering compound system at several low - lying excited states ,",
    "there are many measurements using different reactions endeavored for extracting the information of resonant structure and energy levels , while the ambiguousness for its high excitation state properties of isospins t = 3/2 and t = 1/2 still remains . just as shown in figure [ b11levelspre ] , little spectroscopic knowledge of unbound excited states in @xmath0b has been determined due to the difficulty of extracting the parameters of states above the separation energies of proton ( q@xmath12 = 11.2285 mev ) , neutron ( q@xmath13 = 11.4541 mev ) and triton ( q@xmath14 = 11.2235 mev ) , where several particle channels are simultaneously open . as the analog of the 1.78 mev state in @xmath0be , primary evidence for the 14.33 mev state with @xmath15 = ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , t = 3/2 assignment comes from the @xmath1be(p , @xmath18)@xmath0b reaction @xcite , which also yielded the population of 15.30 mev , the analog state of 2.70 mev in @xmath0be , but without spin - parity and t assignment . for the 15.30 mev state , there is no definite @xmath15 information reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , and its width and spin - parity determinations from the work @xcite are also questionable just as demonstrated by refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "the measurement was undertaken in the hope that the properties , i.e. , the excitation energy e@xmath2 , the spin - parity j@xmath3 , and the proton - decay partial width of those unbound excited states lied over the energy region of present interest shown in fig .",
    "[ b11levelspre ] could be extracted and determined by employing the elastic resonance reaction @xmath1be + p with the thick - target technique in inverse kinematics ( ttik ) @xcite .",
    "comparing with those traditional approaches , the ttik method takes advantage of the fact that a continuous excitation function spectrum can be achieved when the incident energy of beam particles on the target remains unchanged . in the following ,",

    "the measurement of @xmath1be + p elastic resonance scattering was carried out at the heavy ion research facility in lanzhou ( hirfl ) @xcite , china .",
    "a secondary ion beam of @xmath1be was produced by the radioactive ion beam line in lanzhou ( ribll ) through the projectile fragmentation of a 59.62@xmath19 mev @xmath10o primary beam with an average intensity of 100 ena bombarded on a solid 853.96 mg/@xmath20-thick target of @xmath21be .",
    "the schematic view of ribll and the experiment setup for the present measurement are shown in fig . [ expset ] . at the first momentum - dispersive focal plane ( c1 ) , a 3060 @xmath22m - thick aluminium achromatic degrader was installed to reject unwanted ion species from the @xmath1be beam .",
    "two nominal horizontal slits at focal planes c1 ( s1 : @xmath6 15 mm ) and c2 ( s2 : @xmath6 25 mm ) were used to restrict the momentum spread of @xmath1be beam .",
    "the time of flight ( tof ) from the first achromatic focal point t1 to the second one t2 was measured by two 50 @xmath22m - thick plastic scintillators .    at the scattering chamber ( see fig . [ expset ] ) , the incident angles of beam particles on the target were determined by extrapolating the hit - positions recorded by two parallel - plate avalanche counters ( ppac ) , i.e. , ppaca and ppacb , which were 500 mm and 100 mm away from the target , respectively . consequently , the @xmath1be beam of about 92% purity with an intensity of about 5@xmath2310@xmath24 pps and an energy of 7.2@xmath19 mev impinged on a 41.85 mg/@xmath20-thick polyethylene ( pe ) target .",
    "in addition , a 280 @xmath22m - thick silicon detector ( si ) was inserted in front of ppaca during the beam tuning to perform the particle identification with tof . as shown in fig .",
    "[ de_tof ] , @xmath1be nuclei can be distinguished unambiguously with the help of tof .",
    "the scattered particles from the reaction target were detected by three downstream @xmath25e - e silicon telescopes at the end of the scattering chamber , which were placed at laboratory angles of @xmath26 @xmath27 + 16@xmath28 , -16@xmath28 , and 0@xmath28 with respect to the beam axis ( see fig .",
    "[ expset ] ) .",
    "the distances from the telescopes to the reaction target , with solid angles of 21 msr , 20 msr , and 21 msr , were set to be about 344 mm , 349 mm , and 345 mm , respectively . for the sake of convenience in the following description ,",
    "hereafter the three @xmath25e - e silicon telescopes are referred to set1 , set2 , and set3 .",
    "the averaged scattering angles for recoiled particles were determined to be @xmath29 @xmath27 148@xmath28 , 147@xmath28 , and 180@xmath28 via the relation of @xmath29 = 180@xmath30 - 2@xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath25e detectors were position - sensitive double - sided - strip detectors ( 16 @xmath23 16 , 3 mm width of each strip ) , measuring energy and two - dimensional position information of the recoiled particles with thickness of 301 @xmath22 m , 300 @xmath22 m , and 149 @xmath22 m , respectively .",
    "the e silicon detectors , with thickness of 1533 @xmath22 m and 1524 @xmath22 m in set1 and set2 , and 1528 @xmath22 m + 1538 @xmath22 m in set3 , measured the partial or whole energy , depending on whether the scattered particles punching through the @xmath25e - e telescopes . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ partidwithg4 ] , the combination of @xmath25e - e detectors clearly revealed the ability of separating protons from deuterons and tritons while heavier ions were stopped in the target .",
    "the time of flight and si detectors were calibrated using the primary beam @xmath10o , while the position calibration for ppacs and the energy calibration for three silicon telescopes were performed utilizing a standard double @xmath31 source of energy 5.156 mev from @xmath32pu and 5.499 mev from @xmath33pu .",
    "since the two points of @xmath31 source are very close in energy , the back bending points for protons and tritons in the @xmath25e ( channel)-e ( channel ) plot were utilized to carry out the calibration for three silicon telescopes .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ partidwithg4 ] , the calibration result was in excellent agreement with that from geant4 @xcite simulations .    additionally , in the last stage of the measurement ,",
    "an evaluation of background contribution from the reactions of @xmath1be with carbon nuclei in the ( ch@xmath34)@xmath13 target was performed through a separate run with a 50.69 mg/@xmath20-thick carbon target and the same @xmath1be beam as described above . in the following spectra ,",
    "the data was directly extracted from the locus of protons as shown in fig .",
    "[ partidwithg4 ] except for the high - energy ones that were ceased by depositing the remaining energy into detector telescopes .",

    "however , according to the available data of elastic and inelastic proton scatterings from a @xmath1be target @xcite and using a distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) to the energy of interest , the inelastic scattering contributions in our case from the channels of p + @xmath1be@xmath43 can be neglected , thus the energy derived from eq .",

    "could naively produce a character of the tail of the excitation function , but the @xmath66 of the fit to the data was almost unchanged with the exclusion of this state .",
    "it is assumed that we have populated the well - known resonance , i.e. , the analog of the 3.889 mev state in @xmath0be , and a tentative assignment of j@xmath3 = ( 1/2@xmath7 , 3/2@xmath7 ) is set to this state .",

    "to summarize , the elastic resonance scattering of protons from @xmath1be using the thick - target technique in inverse kinematics was performed for the first time to investigate the resonant structure of @xmath0b above the proton - decay threshold .",
