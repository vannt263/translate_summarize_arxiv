    "graph products and bundles are among frequently studied interconnection network topologies . for example the meshes , tori , hypercubes and some of their generalizations are cartesian products .",
    "it is less known that some well - known topologies are cartesian graph bundles , i.e. some twisted hypercubes @xcite and multiplicative circulant graphs @xcite .",
    "other graph products , sometimes under different names , have been studied as interesting network topologies @xcite .    in the design of large interconnection networks",
    "several factors have to be taken into account .",
    "a usual constraint is that each processor can be connected to a limited number of other processors and the delays in communication must not be too long . furthermore , an interconnection network should be fault tolerant , because practical communication networks are exposed to failures of network components .",
    "both failures of nodes and failures of connections between them happen and it is desirable that a network is robust in the sense that a limited number of failures does not break down the whole system .",
    "a lot of work has been done on various aspects of network fault tolerance , see for example the survey @xcite and more recent papers @xcite .",
    "in particular the fault diameter with faulty vertices which was first studied in @xcite and the edge fault diameter has been determined for many important networks recently @xcite .",
    "in particular ,",
    "the ( vertex ) fault diameter and the edge fault diameter of cartesian graph products and cartesian graph bundles was studied recently @xcite .",
    "usually either only edge faults or only vertex faults are considered , while the case when both edges and vertices may be faulty is studied rarely .",
    "for example , @xcite consider hamiltonian properties assuming a combination of vertex and edge faults . in recent work on fault diameter of cartesian graph products and bundles @xcite , analogous results were found for both fault diameter and edge fault diameter .",
    "however , the proofs for vertex and edge faults in @xcite are independent , and our effort to see how results in one case may imply the others was not successful .",
    "a natural question is whether it is possible to design a uniform theory that would enable unified proofs or provide tools to translate results for one type of faults to the other .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study general relationships between invariants under vertex and edge faults . some basic results on edge , vertex and mixed fault diameters for general graphs appear in @xcite .",
    "in order to study the fault diameters of graph products and bundles under mixed faults , it is important to understand the generalized connectivities",
    ".    here we study mixed connectivity which generalizes both vertex and edge connectivity .",
    "it is known that cartesian graph bundle with fibre @xmath8 over the base graph @xmath10 is @xmath24-connected and @xmath25-edge connected @xcite . in this paper",
    "we generalize these results to mixed connectivity of cartesian graph bundles .",
    "more precisely , assuming that the fibre @xmath8 is @xmath9-connected and the base graph @xmath10 is @xmath11-connected , then cartesian graph bundle @xmath12 with fibre @xmath8 over the base graph @xmath10 is @xmath13-connected . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath14 , then the cartesian graph bundle is also @xmath15-connected . as a corollary , mixed connectivity of the cartesian product of finite number of factors",
    "is given .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "some general definitions are given , and in section 3 the mixed connectivity is defined and some basic facts are observed .",
    "section 4 recalls definition of graph bundles and states the main result ( theorem [ mpsv ] ) which is proved in the last section .",
