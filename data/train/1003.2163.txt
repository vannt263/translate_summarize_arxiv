    "+ the presence of maxima in the spin depolarization length at intermediate fields can be explained by the interplay between two competing factors : in the linear regime , as the field becomes larger , the electron momentum and the drift velocity increase in the direction of the field . on the other hand",

    "these are essential for the high performance of spin - based devices , in order to extend the functionality of conventional devices to higher working temperatures and higher electric field amplitudes and to allow the development of new information processing systems .",
