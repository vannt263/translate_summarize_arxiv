    "the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) is a well - known magnetohydrodynamic instability that arises at the interface between two fluids in relative motion ( see the classical textbooks by * ? ? ?",

    "the khi is believed to operate on many astrophysical plasmas as , e.g. , the magnetopause ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the khi is also at work in the solar atmosphere .",
    "recent observations by @xcite and @xcite confirmed the presence of the khi in the solar corona .",

    "* ) . more relevant for the present investigation are the observations by @xcite and @xcite of turbulent flows and instabilities in solar prominences , which have been interpreted in terms of the rayleigh - taylor instability and the khi .",
    "the peculiar properties of prominences , i.e. , relatively cool and dense plasma condensations supported in the corona by the magnetic field , make them a very interesting subject for the investigation of the khi .",
    "in particular , the fact that the prominence plasma is only partially ionized can have important effects on the behavior and evolution of the khi .",
    "it is known that a velocity shear at the interface between two incompressible plasmas is always unstable in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field component along the flow direction suppresses the khi for sub - alfvnic velocity shear in fully ionized plasmas ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the situation is more complicated if the plasma is partially ionized as happens , e.g. , in prominences . in a partially ionized plasma composed of ions and neutrals ,",
    "the two species behave very differently when a magnetic field is applied .",
    "neutrals are insensitive to the magnetic field so that their natural tendency is to be unstable for any velocity shear , while ions feel the stabilizing presence of the magnetic field .",
    "the coupling between neutrals and ions through collisions is therefore crucial for the growth rate of the khi and its evolution ( see a discussion on the relevance of ion - neutral interaction for plasma instabilities in * ? ? ?",

    "our equilibrium is composed of two partially ionized and magnetized homogeneous plasmas separated by a sharp interface .",
    "we consider a hydrogen plasma composed of ions ( protons ) , electrons , and neutral atoms .",
    "we use cartesian coordinates .",
    "the @xmath0-direction is normal to the interface , so that the plane @xmath1 coincides with the interface .",
    "we denote by the indices 1 and 2 the regions corresponding to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . in the two regions ,",
    "the equilibrium magnetic field is straight and along the @xmath4-direction , namely @xmath5 , with @xmath6 constant .",

    "the flow velocities can be different on both sides of the interface , i.e. , @xmath13 .",

    "plasma dynamics are governed by the momentum equation , the energy equation , and the mass conservation equation of ions , electrons , and neutrals .",

    "subscripts 1 or 2 must be used as appropriate when the equations are applied in the two regions of the equilibrium .    in the following sections we express the results in dimensionless units .",
    "we express velocities in units of @xmath65 and distances in units of the typical length - scale in the @xmath4-direction , @xmath66 . in particular applications @xmath66",
    "may be related to the wavelength of the plasma perturbations so that @xmath66 may be estimated from observations .",
    "alternatively , if observations of wavelengths are not available , @xmath66 may be defined using , e.g. , the typical scale of the variation of the plasma parameters along the @xmath4-direction .",

    "however , as @xmath89 decreases the second branch disappears and only the first branch remains .",
    "the behavior of the first branch is complex because it has two regions of instability .",

    "hence for a weak coupling between the species the stabilizing roles of compressibility and the magnetic field are overridden .",
    "this is mainly a consequence of the influence of neutrals , which are insentitive to the magnetic field , on ions . as @xmath112 keeps increasing and the coupling between species gets stronger two additional stable regions appear at low velocity shear",
    "this first stable region is due to the fact that ion - neutral collisions are able to stabilize neutrals for small velocity shear .",
    "the second stable zone appears due to the combined effect of collisions and the magnetic field on the ion - electron fluid . for @xmath142 ion - neutral collisions can eventually suppress the unstable zone between the two stable regions so that single stable zone is present for low velocity shear as in the single - fluid limit .     vs. @xmath70 with @xmath137 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath138 , @xmath161 , and @xmath99 .",

    "the vertical dotted line corresponds to the value of @xmath70 used in figure  [ fig : multinu ] .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] ]    compressibility has a strong impact on the khi in comparison to the incompressible case , specially when we depart from the limit @xmath139 . in general , the effect of compressibilty gets stronger as @xmath162 decreases . for large",
    "@xmath162 the effect of compressibility is weak and the growth rates tend to those in the incompressible case .",

    "in addition , several effects not considered here may reduce the khi timescale for smaller velocities .",
    "for example , to take the flow of neutrals not strictly parallel to the magnetic field direction may decrease the khi timescale to values compatible with the observed instability and plume lifetimes ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a different magnetic configuration may also influence the khi growth rates .",
    "however , the important result we want to stress here is that the khi is present for flow velocities which are of the same order as those observed .",

    "in this paper we have studied the khi due to shear flow at an interface between two partially ionized plasmas .",
    "we have focused on the effects of ion - neutral collisions and compressibility .",
    "our results are summarized as follows .    in a collisionless plasma , neutrals are unstable for any velocity shear , while the ion - electron fluid is unstable for super - alfvnic shear only thanks to the stabilizing role of the magnetic field . when ion - neutral collisions are included , ions and neutrals get coupled . in the incompressible case",
    ", we obtain that ion - neutral collisions are not able to stabilize neutrals regardless the value of the collision frequency .",

    ", the domain of instability depends strongly on the plasma parameters .",
    "in particular , the values of the collision frequency and the density contrast are relevant . for high collision frequencies and low density contrasts neutrals become stable and the khi can be suppressed for sub - alfvnic velocity shear . for high density contrast neutrals",
    "are more unstable and the khi can be present for sub - alfvnic velocity shear .",
    "we have applied our results to solar prominences . in the case of turbulent plumes , we find that the khi is present for flow velocities of the order of those observed .",
    "the theoretical khi timescales are larger than the values consistent with the observations , which is probably a consequence of using a simplified model . on the contrary , in the case of flow along threads we find that the khi can not be responsible for the thread disappearance ,",
    "so another mechanism must be involved .    here",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the linear phase of the khi .",
    "linear growth rates provide us with characteristic timescales for the instability to operate . however , nonlinear studies are needed to assess the real impact of the instability on the evolution of the plasma parameters . in a recent work",
    "@xcite investigated the nonlinear evolution of the khi in a partially ionized plasma in the ambipolar - dominated regime . despite the differences in set - up and formalism , it is instructive to compare the results of @xcite with our present findings .",

    "no dependence of the perturbations in their @xmath4-direction was considered .",
    "therefore , the equilibrium of @xcite is equivalent to our model with our @xmath91 and our @xmath47 set equal to their @xmath46 .",
    "@xcite concluded that the linear growth rates in the ambipolar - dominated regime are the same as in the ideal case , i.e. , in the absence of ambipolar diffusion . in our formalism",
    "the ambipolar - dominated regime in which ions and neutrals are strongly coupled is equivalent to our case @xmath142 .",
    "we find that the linear growth rate and the threshold shear in the limit @xmath159 ( see section  [ sec : comp ] ) are the same as in the fully ionized case but replacing the density of ions by the sum of densities of ions and neutrals .",
    "hence , our present results and the conclusions of @xcite seem to be in agreement in this particular limit .",
    "our results predict that the growth rate depends on @xmath112 when we depart from the limit @xmath159 .",
    "the present investigation may be extended in the future by taking into account different flow velocities and directions for ions and neutrals , by incorporating the effect of gravity , and by including nonideal effects such as nonadiabatic mechanisms or magnetic diffusion .",
