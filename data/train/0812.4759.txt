    "<S> we consider the dynamics of a thin liquid film in the attractive substrate potential and under the action of a longitudinal or a tilted vibration . using a multiscale technique we split the film motion into the oscillatory and the averaged parts . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the vibration is assumed high enough for the inertial effects to become essential for the oscillatory motion . applying the lubrication approximation for the averaged motion we obtain the amplitude equation , which includes contributions from gravity , van der waals attraction , surface tension , and the vibration . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the longitudinal vibration leads to destabilization of the initially planar film . </S>",
    "<S> stable solutions corresponding to the deflected free surface are possible in this case . </S>",
    "<S> linear analysis in the case of tilted vibration shows that either stabilization or destabilization are possible . </S>",
    "<S> stabilization of the dewetting film by mechanical action ( i.e. , the vibration ) was first reported by us in pre * 77 * , 036320 ( 2008 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect may be important for applications . </S>"
