    "the casimir effect has drawn attention to itself over decades ( for a review and a collection of references , see @xcite ) .",
    "various concepts and calculational techniques have been developed , but only few of them have turned out to be capable of dealing with realistic ( at least kramers - kronig consistent ) dielectric bodies .",
    "the familiar ` mode summation ' method of deriving casimir forces as employed by casimir himself @xcite , for instance , suffers from the obvious fact that there are no modes to expand the ( macroscopic ) field operators when absorbing bodies are involved rather than idealized boundaries .",
    "a generalized mode decomposition ( with the mode functions being orthogonal with respect to an appropriate ` weighted ' inner product ) is appropriate only for ( narrow ) bandwidth - limited fields when dispersion and absorption may be neglected @xcite . by contrast , all frequencies should be included in the calculation of the casimir force .",
    "moreover , the annoying infinities one has to cope with when using modes always demand the application of regularization techniques @xcite . to tackle realistic problems",
    ", one can proceed in essentially three ways :    1 .   the electromagnetic field and",
    "the material bodies are treated macroscopically , and explicit field quantization is avoided by invoking statistical thermodynamics to write down the field correlation functions that are needed in the maxwell stress tensor .",
    "2 .   the electromagnetic field and",
    "the material bodies are quantized on a microscopic level .",
    "the bodies are described by appropriate model systems that feature dissipation of energy into a heat bath , and the coupled field - matter equations are tried to be solved . in general ,",
    "such a microscopic approach to the problem is hardly feasible without rather sweeping assumptions about the microscopic processes involved .",
    "the presence of dielectric bodies is described by means of a spatially varying permittivity that is a complex function of frequency , without addressing a specific microscopic model . for given permittivity , the macroscopic",
    ", medium - assisted electromagnetic field is quantized , by using a source - quantity representation of the field in terms of the classical green tensor and an infinite set of appropriately chosen bosonic basic fields .",
    "the first method was introduced by lifshitz @xcite .",
    "he obtained the force acting on two ( semi - infinite ) absorbing dielectric walls by calculating the maxwell stress tensor in the region between the walls from field correlation functions , which he could evaluate by employing a dissipation - fluctuation relation for the ` random electric field ' that acts as a langevin noise source and balances the effect of absorption in the maxwell equations . although lifshitz calculation is not really quantum , he was fully aware of the fact that the ``  zero point vibrations of the radiation field '' @xcite cause the effect at zero temperature .",
    "lifshitz results were later re - derived by schwinger _",
    "_ using source theory to circumvent quantization @xcite . in a recent paper ,",
    "matloob @xcite has essentially followed lifshitz , by postulating field correlation functions , without explicit field quantization .",
    "an instructive treatment of the casimir effect on the basis of the second method was given by kupiszewska @xcite , using a harmonic - oscillator model for the matter .",
    "the effect of the heat bath accounting for dissipation was properly subsumed within a markovian damping term together with a langevin noise source corresponding to the random field in lifshitz approach .",
    "unfortunately , the calculations were carried out only for one - dimensional ( single - slab ) systems .",
    "recently , this theory has been used to study the casimir force between multilayered plates @xcite .    here , we base the calculations on the third method recently used by toma @xcite .",
    "it needs no external input other than the ( phenomenologically given ) permittivities of the bodies .",
    "apart from dropping the bulk part of the green tensor ( giving rise to unobservable bulk stress only ) , no regularization is needed .",
    "removal of the bulk stress , which is sometimes referred to as `` removing the minkowski contribution '' in the literature , is in fact necessary in all approaches , even in the framework of schwinger s clever source theory @xcite .",
    "let us briefly comment on two further techniques that have been employed to calculate casimir forces . in the surface - mode approach originally used by van kampen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite to obtain casimir forces in the _ non - retarded limit _ , the calculations are based on a complete set of solutions to laplace s equation . summing , by means of a complex contour integral , the zero - point energy assigned to each of these solutions then yields the potential energy of the force .",
    "later , the method was extended to include also retardation @xcite . however , in this case _ all _ normal modes and not only the surface modes should be considered .",
    "though the method is intrinsically based on mode expansion and hence on real permittivities , correct results can also be found for absorbing material if at some stage of the calculation the permittivities are allowed to become complex . in the scattering approach @xcite , which employs elastic ( i.e. unitary ) scattering theory , the sum of the mode frequencies is represented as an integral containing scattering phase shifts or related quantities ( see also @xcite ) , and",
    "the integration is performed in the complex plane . again",
    ", if complex permittivities are plugged into the resulting expressions ( derived for non - absorptive materials ) , correct results can be obtained .",
    "note that within the framework of both methods the sum over the relevant mode frequencies appears as the singularity contributions to certain complex contour integrals , which are more generally valid than the initial expressions based on the concept of normal modes . in this paper",
    ", we first derive a formula for the casimir force between multilayer dielectric plates at finite temperatures , which may be regarded as being a generalization of the lifshitz formula @xcite to multilayer systems and an extension to finite temperatures of the zero - temperature result derived by toma @xcite .",
    "in particular for one - dimensional systems , the formula reduces to an expression of the type derived by kupiszewska @xcite . transforming the formula to a form that is very suitable for further analytical and numerical evaluation , we study the dependence of the casimir force on various system parameters ( such as the stacking order and the frequency response of the permittivity ) in detail .",
    "the numerical calculations are performed for single - resonance dielectric matter of drude - lorentz type .",
    "it is well known that the casimir force between semi - infinite dielectric walls becomes proportional to @xmath1 for large wall separation @xmath2 .",
    "we show that is also the ` generic ' behavior for layered walls in general . however , yet different types of long - distance laws are also possible",
    ". in particular , for single - slab walls of finite thickness , the asymptotic @xmath1 law changes to a @xmath0 law .",
    "we further show that the case of small wall separation @xmath2 can be treated within lifshitz approximations @xcite .",

    "the formalism is outlined and the basic formula for the casimir force is given .",
