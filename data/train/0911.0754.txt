    "graphene is a single sheet of carbon atoms forming a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice .",
    "this material has only recently become available for experimental study , and its exotic physical properties have spurred a lot of interest  @xcite .",
    "known theoretically since the late 40s  @xcite , graphene is a promising candidate for applications due to its excellent mechanical properties  @xcite , scalability down to nanometer sizes  @xcite , and exceptional electronic properties  @xcite .",
    "the conical shape of conduction and valence bands near the @xmath0 and @xmath1 points in the brillouin zone renders graphene an interesting type of quasi - relativistic condensed - matter system  @xcite where mass - less dirac - fermion - like quasiparticles are present at low energy .",
    "in contrast to the truly relativistic case , the spin degree of freedom in their dirac equation corresponds to a pseudo - spin that distinguishes degenerate states on two sublattices formed by two nonequivalent atom sites present in the unit cell .",
    "the pseudo - spin degeneracy can be broken by spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , which mixes pseudospin and real spin .",
    "there has been huge interest in soi in graphene , resulting in a large body of theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite work .",
    "there are two main causes for the soi in graphene .",
    "firstly , external electric fields ( e.g. , due to the presence of a substrate , a backgate , or adatoms ) and local curvature fields ( ripples ) induce a soi  @xcite whose coupling strength we denote by @xmath2 .",
    "we refer to this contribution as the _ rashba _ soi in the following .",
    "in addition , there is an _ intrinsic _ soi  @xcite with strength @xmath3 , which is caused by the atomic coulomb potentials .",
    "existence of the intrinsic and rashba sois can be inferred from group - theoretical arguments  @xcite . however , the actual values of their respective strengths @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the subject of recent debate .",
    "initial estimates  @xcite have been refined using tight - binding models  @xcite and density - functional calculations  @xcite .",
    "first experimental observations of spin - orbit - related effects in graphene s band structure based on arpes data  @xcite have later been questioned  @xcite .",
    "detailed knowledge about typical magnitudes and ways to influence @xmath2 and @xmath3 is crucial , e.g. , for understanding spin - dependent transport  @xcite and spin - based quantum devices  @xcite in graphene .",
    "the desire to identify possible alternative means of observing , and measuring , spin - orbit coupling strengths in graphene has provided the motivation for our work reported here .",
    "we present a theoretical analysis of graphene s optical conductivity @xmath4 , extending previous studies  @xcite to the situation with finite soi .",
    "soi effects on the dc conductivity were investigated in a recent theoretical study for a bipolar graphene @xmath5 junction  @xcite , and the effect of intrinsic soi on the polarisation - dependent optical absorption of graphene was considered in ref .  .",
    "our study presents the analogous scenario for the richer case of the optical conductivity when both intrinsic and extrinsic types of soi are present .",
    "since @xmath2 can be tuned by external fields , we will analyze various situations distinguished by the relative strengths of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "our findings suggest that optical - conductivity measurements can be useful to identify and separate different soi sources .",
    "we work on the simplest theory level ( linear response theory , no interactions , no disorder ) and disregard boundary effects for the moment .",
    "the structure of the remainder of this article is as follows . in sec .",

    "we start from a low - energy continuum description of graphene  @xcite , @xmath8 without the soi terms @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the single - particle hamiltonian in plane - wave representation reads @xmath11 with fermi velocity @xmath12  m / s .",

    "analogous pauli matrices @xmath17 act in the two - valley space spanned by states near the two @xmath0 points .",
    "the part of the effective hamiltonian describing rashba soi is given by @xmath18 where @xmath2 includes both the external electric - field and curvature effects in a coarse - grained approximation , with the latter assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath19 act in the real spin space . for the intrinsic soi induced by atomic potentials",
    ", we have @xmath20 the full hamiltonian is then an @xmath21 matrix in the combined sublattice , spin , and valley space .",
