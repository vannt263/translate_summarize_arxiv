    "unlike chaos in finite dimensional systems , the area of chaos in partial differential equations has been a long standing open field . during the past ten years",
    ", there have been some remarkable developments in the area of chaos in partial differential equations by the author and collaborators .",
    "our main results can be briefly described as follows : a systematic program is developed for proving the existence of homoclinic orbits for perturbed soliton equations .",
    "the program involves machineries from integrable theory , dynamical systems , and partial differential equations .",
    "the types of homoclinic orbits thus obtained can be either transversal or of silnikov . with regard to transversal homoclinic orbits , shadowing lemmas are utilized or developed to prove the existence of chaos . with regard to silnikov homoclinic orbits , smale horseshoes are constructed to prove the existence of chaos .",
    "the main machineries from integrable theory are the isospectral theory and darboux transformations .",
    "the main machineries from dynamical systems are persistence of invariant manifolds , fenichel fibers , melnikov measurement , and other measurements .",
    "the main machineries from partial differential equations are local well - posedness and regularity .",
    "another exciting development happened to euler equations of incompressible inviscid fluids .",
    "lax pairs for both 2d and 3d euler equations was found by the author and steve childress .",
    "a darboux transformation for the lax pair of 2d euler equation was also found by artyom yurov and the author .",
    "the philosophical significance of the existence of lax pairs for euler equations is fundamentally important . if one defines integrability of an equation by the existence of a lax pair , then both 2d and 3d euler equations are integrable .",
    "more importantly , both 2d and 3d navier - stokes equations at high reynolds numbers are near integrable systems .",
    "such a point of view changes our old ideology on euler and navier - stokes equations",
    ".    the most important application of the theory on chaos in partial differential equations in theoretical physics will be on the study of turbulence .",
    "our approach of studying turbulence is different from many other studies in which one starts with stokes equation to prove results on navier - stokes equations for small reynolds number . in our studies",
    ", we start with euler equations and view navier - stokes equations at large reynolds number as singular perturbations of euler equations . for this goal , we chose the 2d navier - stokes equations under periodic boundary conditions to begin a dynamical system study on 2d turbulence .",
    "we started with a simple fixed point of 2d euler equation , and studied the linearized 2d euler equation at the fixed point .",
    "a complete spectral theorem is obtained . in particular",
    ", we found unstable eigenvalues .",
    "then , naturally we are interested in the corresponding unstable manifold .",
    "such an unstable manifold forms the prototype of the attractor of navier - stokes equations at large reynolds number .",
    "and long term turbulence lives around the attractor . finding the unstable",
    "manifold is not successful yet .",
    "partial success is accomplished in finding the corresponding unstable manifold for some galerkin truncation . here",
    "the unstable manifold is the 2d surface of an ellipsoid .",
    "stable and unstable manifolds together form a lip - shape configuration .",
    "whether or not the stable and unstable manifolds for 2d euler equation have the same topology as above is not known .",
    "in fact , the existence of stable and unstable manifolds for 2d euler equation has not been proved .",
    "in terms of proving the existence of a homoclinic orbit , the most common tool is the so - called melnikov integral method @xcite @xcite .",
    "this method was subsequently developed by holmes and marsden @xcite , and most recently by wiggins @xcite . for partial differential equations ,",
    "this method was mainly developed by li et al .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "there are two derivations for the melnikov integrals .",
    "one is the so - called geometric argument @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the other is the so - called liapunov - schmitt argument @xcite @xcite .",
    "the liapunov - schmitt argument is a fixed - point type argument which directly leads to the existence of a homoclinic orbit .",
    "the condition for the existence of a fixed point is the melnikov integral .",
    "the geometric argument is a signed distance argument which applies to more general situations than the liapunov - schmitt argument .",
    "it turns out that the geometric argument is a much more powerful machinary than the liapunov - schmitt argument .",
    "in particular , the geometric argument can handle geometric singular perturbation problems .",
    "i shall also mention an interesting derivation in @xcite .    in establishing the existence of homoclinic orbits in high dimensions ,",
    "one often needs other tools besides the melnikov analysis .",
    "for example , when studying orbits homoclinic to fixed points created through resonances in ( @xmath0)-dimensional near - integrable systems , one often needs tools like fenichel fibers , as presented in previous chapter , to set up geometric measurements for locating such homoclinic orbits .",
    "such homoclinic orbits often have a geometric singular perturbation nature . in such cases ,",
    "the liapunov - schmitt argument can not be applied . for such works on finite dimensional systems ,",
