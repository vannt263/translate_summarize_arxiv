    "the statistical isotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is one of the central pillars in modern cosmology . manifesting the direction independence of the primordial spectrum at the onset of the hot era , it is renowned for its robustness against modifications in the bulk of inflationary models .",
    "simple reasoning usually invokes the cosmic no - hair conjecture  @xcite which states the rapid isotropization of the universe in the presence of a positive constant energy density .",
    "scalar fluctuations ( e.g. , carried by the inflaton ) evolve in the rotationally invariant metric and acquire a direction - independent spectrum , giving rise to the statistical isotropy of cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "clearly , a violation of this property observed in the cmb sky would indicate a nontrivial extension of currently conventional cosmology .",
    "one way to break statistical isotropy is by introducing vector fields with nonvanishing vacuum expectation values  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the ackermann  carroll ",
    "wise ( acw ) model  @xcite , the idea is to add a massive vector with a fixed space - like norm .",
    "this allows for the anisotropic evolution of the universe which introduces the direction dependence into the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath9 . for future convenience , we write it in the generic form , @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the direction associated with the cosmological wavevector @xmath12 ; the @xmath13 s are spherical harmonics , the @xmath14 s are coefficients parametrizing the statistical anisotropy , and @xmath15 is the direction - independent amplitude . in the acw model ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath15 is constant , i.e. , it can be tuned to unity without loss of generality .",
    "furthermore , the predicted statistical anisotropy is of the quadrupole type , i.e. , only the coefficients @xmath16 survive , which are not independent . in particular , by an appropriate choice of the reference frame , one can tune all coefficients @xmath16 , except for @xmath17 , to zero .",
    "the @xmath18 axis of this reference frame is associated with the preferred direction in the sky .",
    "hereafter , we use the term _ special quadrupole _ for this type of statistical anisotropy .    soon afterwards",
    ", it was realized that the acw model is unstable  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the longitudinal component of the massive vector that propagates as a ghost in the inflationary background .",
    "similarly , all vector models of inflation violating gauge @xmath19 symmetry share the same problem  @xcite .",
    "this problem does not arise in the models of ref .",
    "@xcite that introduce the maxwellian term modified by the explicit coupling to the inflaton .",
    "remarkably , for quite a wide range of coupling functions and inflaton potentials , one can achieve the anisotropic expansion of the universe  @xcite in a ghost free manner  @xcite .",
    "( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews . )",
    "the outcome of anisotropic inflation is still the direction dependence of the acw type , while the preferred direction is associated with the electric component of the electromagnetic field .",
    "interestingly , the amplitude of the special quadrupole relies on the overall number of @xmath4-folds during inflation  @xcite .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in turn , this means that the duration of inflation in those models can be strongly constrained with the cmb data .",
    "statistical anisotropy may follow naturally from alternative frameworks , e.g. , the ( pseudo)conformal universe  @xcite",
    ". minimal models of this type incorporate at least two fields : one  which we call @xmath20with the conformal weight @xmath21 , and the zero - weighted conformal field @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , the conformal rolling scenario  @xcite and galilean genesis  @xcite two known incarnations of the pseudo(conformal ) universe so far  deal with the weight @xmath23 field @xmath20 .",
    "we focus on this case in the present paper .",
    "the field @xmath20 is then assumed to have the time - dependent solution @xmath24 spontaneously breaking conformal group @xmath25 down to the de sitter subgroup @xmath26 .",
    "the constant @xmath27 is the only relevant parameter of the conformal rolling scenario or galilean genesis .",
    "the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath28 fixes the phenomenological properties of the weight-0 field perturbations @xmath29 evolving in the background   created by the field @xmath20 . in particular ",
    "regardless of the precise details of the microscopic physics  one ends up with the scale - invariant power spectrum of the perturbations @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "thus , they may serve as the source of primordial fluctuations in the standard matter at the onset of the rd stage .    the setup of the ( pseudo)conformal universe leads unavoidably to a nonzero statistical anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "this originates from the interaction between weight-0 and weight-1 perturbations .",
    "there are two possible types of predictions depending on the state of cosmological perturbations at times when conformal symmetry becomes irrelevant .",
    "if they are already superhorizon at these times , the resulting direction dependence is of the quadrupole type akin to anisotropic inflation  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the statistical anisotropy is particularly rich in the situation with subhorizon cosmological perturbations  @xcite . in that case , all the coefficients @xmath14 with even @xmath30 are generically nonzero in eq .  . in both cases ,",
    "the direction dependence is governed by the constant @xmath27 .",
    "this gives a simple idea of how to constrain the models of interest from the nonobservation of statistical anisotropy in the cmb sky .",
    "our main goal in the present paper is to constrain models of the early universe that predict statistical anisotropy .",
    "we do this in the same manner as in our previous paper  @xcite , where the conformal rolling scenario was constrained by making use of the wmap7 data .",
    "namely , we apply quadratic maximum likelihood ( qml)-based estimators  @xcite to the cmb data and establish upper limits on model parameters . in the present paper",
    ", we turn to the wmap9 maps . with the latter ,",
    "there is a strong reason to anticipate much tighter constraints .",
    "we expect that the wmap9 data lack the anomalously large quadrupolar statistical anisotropy observed in the @xmath31 band of the 5-year release  @xcite .",
    "the anomaly was first interpreted as a hint towards the acw model .",
    "however , the preferred direction of the signal was found to be highly aligned with poles of the ecliptic plane  @xcite .",
    "its frequency dependence was also suspicious : the signal so prominent in the @xmath31 band was much weaker in the @xmath32 band  @xcite .",
    "finally , results from alternative searches , i.e. , large scale structure surveys , favor statistically isotropic primordial perturbations  @xcite .",
    "these three points strongly indicate the systematic origin of the signal detected . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was suggested that beam asymmetries not accounted for in the previous analysis could strongly bias primordial statistical anisotropy .",
    "indeed , upon the inclusion of beam asymmetries into the computational scheme , the large quadrupole statistical anisotropy vanishes .",
    "this was first shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath31 band of the wmap7 data . to deal with this effect in the 9-year final data release",
    ", wmap collaboration has produced the beam - symmetrized temperature maps  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we review vector models of inflation predicting statistical anisotropy .",
    "we focus on the particular class of scenarios with the maxwellian term nonminimally coupled to the inflaton .",
    "we review models of the ( pseudo)conformal universe in sec .  3 .",
    "4 we establish the estimators which are most appropriate for our constraining purposes . in sec .  5 we apply the estimators to models of interest and obtain constraints on their parameters .",
    "we compare our constraints with similar bounds obtained from the planck data in sec .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss inflationary scenarios which lead to statistical anisotropy .",
    "we focus on a particular class of slow roll inflation that incorporates abelian gauge fields with @xmath19 gauge symmetry .",
    "the healthy extension of inflation in terms of vectors is achieved by the following modification of the standard maxwellian term  @xcite : @xmath33 here @xmath34 is some function of the inflaton @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the field strength of the vector field , @xmath37 .",
    "the main statement of ref .",
    "@xcite is that for quite a wide range of kinetic gauge functions @xmath34 there is a chance of obtaining a prolonged anisotropic evolution .",
    "that is , the space - time metric tends to the attractor solution @xmath38 \\ ; .\\ ] ] here @xmath39 is the parameter which measures the deviation from the rotational invariance .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of inflaton fluctuations in this `` hairy '' background   leads to a directional dependence of the acw type in the primordial power spectrum .",
    "here we write it in the conventional form , @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the angle between the wave vector @xmath12 and the direction @xmath42 of the electric field @xmath43 generated during the inflationary stage .",
    "the amplitude @xmath44 is sourced by the electric field , i.e. , @xmath45 , as we discuss in more detail in what follows .",
    "the relationship between the power spectrum   and the generic one   is given by the relations @xmath46 which are valid in the approximation of the small amplitude @xmath47 , which is somewhat different from the one given by eq .  . the difference , however , is the direction - independent piece , which can be absorbed into the redefinition of the spectrum @xmath48 . ] . note that @xmath49 in eq .  .",
    "to avoid confusion in the future , let us make one remark here .",
    "though we use the terms `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' , our definitions of the corresponding fields are different from the conventional ones .",
    "namely  @xcite , @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the expectation value of the function @xmath34 , and a prime denotes the derivative with respect to conformal time . with these definitions , the electromagnetic energy density is given by the standard expression @xmath52 at all times .",
    "let us discuss briefly conditions at which statistical anisotropy is generated .",
    "in the situation with the standard maxwellian term , i.e. , provided that @xmath53 , electric and magnetic fields fall down rapidly with time , as does the electromagnetic energy density @xmath54 , which redshifts away as @xmath55 .",
    "this standard prediction can be avoided given the nontrivial structure of the function @xmath34 .",
    "a constant electric field is generated for the class of functions @xmath34 defined by  @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the inflaton potential . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the case @xmath58 is argued to be the critical one , i.e. , for @xmath59 the universe is statistically isotropic and so is the primordial power spectrum . on the other hand , for @xmath60",
    "one finds the nontrivial attractor solution for the electric field and the anisotropic metric of the form  .",
    "the deviation from the rotational invariance is measured by  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the slow - roll parameter .",
    "the amplitude of statistical anisotropy is related to the violation of rotational invariance , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "in fact , even for the case @xmath58 , one finds the anisotropic power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the enhancement of infrared fluctuations of the gauge field by the standard inflationary mechanism .",
    "these quantum fluctuations behave like the classical field after they exit the horizon .",
    "consequently , modes which exit the horizon before the time @xmath64 in the number of @xmath4-folds act as an additional anisotropic background for inflaton fluctuations . to account for this new effect ( pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one should study the evolution of inflaton fluctuations in the overall classical electric field , @xmath65 here @xmath66 follows from the equation of motion ( e.o.m . ) , while @xmath67 originates from quantum fluctuations , which get enhanced and classicalize before the time @xmath68 when inflaton perturbations leave the horizon ( hence the subscript `` ir '' ) .",
    "note that @xmath67 is a random gaussian field characterized by zero mean and variance  @xcite , @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the number of @xmath4-folds from the beginning of inflation and until the time @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath71 , with @xmath72 being the overall number of @xmath4-folds during inflation .",
    "taking into account both sources of statistical anisotropy , one writes the amplitude @xmath44 as follows  @xcite : @xmath73 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite . ) quite unexpectedly , one observes a large magnitude of statistical anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "so , the order one amplitude @xmath74 is obtained already for the ratio @xmath75 as tiny as @xmath76 .",
    "the point is that one expects a much larger energy density @xmath54 on rather general grounds . indeed , according to its quantum origin , we note that the factor @xmath70 in eq .",
    "is considered to be a large number in conventional inflationary scenarios .",
    "hence , the naturally large amplitude @xmath44 .",
    "to handle the situation , one assumes a tuned duration of inflation , i.e. , @xmath77 .",
    "we reiterate this statement in the future , when imposing constraints on model parameters .",
    "furthermore , the purely classical field @xmath66 is related to the potential @xmath57 by @xmath78 substituting this into eq .",

    "the convenience of the vector @xmath92 introduced in eq .",
    "is that its components @xmath93 obey gaussian statistics ( unlike the amplitude @xmath44 ) .",
    "namely , they have zero means and variances given by @xmath94 considering the cases @xmath95 and @xmath96 separately is natural , since fields @xmath97 and @xmath98 are largely unrelated to each other barring scenarios where two electric fields accidentally cancel each other with a high accuracy . with this qualification case",

    "generating statistical anisotropy at inflation requires strong assumptions about the inflationary stage , at least in the model we have discussed . on the other hand ,",
    "a violation of statistical isotropy may arise naturally in alternative frameworks , e.g. , the ( pseudo)conformal universe . in secs .",

    "the interaction between weight-0 and weight-1 field perturbations sources nontrivial phenomenology in ( pseudo)conformal universe models  @xcite .",

    "limit  . note , however , that the random nature of the field @xmath67 was not accounted for in the derivation of eq .  .",
    "thus , the latter is less conservative by its definition and may become weaker if the randomness is included .",

    "models of the ( pseudo)conformal universe may also lead to potentially large non - gaussianities  @xcite . in particular , the trispectrum  @xcite governed by the parameter @xmath189 , can be used to constrain the latter from nonobservation in the planck data .",

    "<S> we constrain several models of the early universe that predict a statistical anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) sky . we make use of wmap9 maps deconvolved with beam asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> as compared to previous releases of wmap data , they do not exhibit the anomalously large quadrupole of statistical anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to strengthen the limits on the parameters of models established earlier in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the amplitude of the special quadrupole is constrained as @xmath0 at @xmath1 c.l . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath2 at @xmath3 c.l . ) independently of the preferred direction in the sky . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limit is obtained on the total number of @xmath4-folds in anisotropic inflation with the maxwellian term nonminimally coupled to the inflaton , namely @xmath5 at @xmath1 c.l . </S>",

    "<S> we also constrain models of the ( pseudo)conformal universe . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest constraint is obtained for spectator scenarios involving a long stage of subhorizon evolution after conformal rolling , which reads @xmath8 at @xmath1 c.l . , in terms of the relevant parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the analogous constraint is much weaker in dynamical models , e.g. , galilean genesis . </S>"
