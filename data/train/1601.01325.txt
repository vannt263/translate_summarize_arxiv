    "the _ extreme eternal laws _ or _",

    "one of the main points of this work is to show the contrary .",
    "indeed , a modification of the original breadth - first - walk from @xcite , combined with a rigorous formulation ( see proposition [ puriarm ] ) of uribe s @xcite graphical interpretation of the armendriz representation @xcite , one arrives to the following claim of independent interest , here stated for readers benefit in the simplest ( purely ) homogenous setting .",

    ", the simultaneous breadth - first walks framework allows for a particularly elegant treatment of surplus edges , postponed to @xcite .",
    "the analysis similar to that of @xcite ( to be done in sections [ s : sl ] and [ s : c ] ) now yields :    [ tmain ] fix a lvy - type process @xmath80 , and for any @xmath101 define @xmath102 let @xmath103 be defined as in ( [ defbtc ] ) . for each @xmath62 , let @xmath104 be the infinite vector of ordered excursion lengths of @xmath103 away from @xmath36 . then @xmath105 is a cdlg realization of @xmath67 .      for almost two decades",
    "the only stochastic merging process widely studied by probabilists was the ( kingman ) coalescent @xcite .",
    "starting with aldous @xcite , and pitman @xcite , sagitov @xcite , and donnelly and kurtz @xcite , the main - stream probability research on coalescents was much diversified .",
    "the kingman coalescent and , more generally , the mass - less ( exchangeable ) coalescents of @xcite mostly appear in connection to the mathematical population genetics , as universal ( robust ) scaling limits of genealogical trees ( see for example @xcite , or a survey @xcite ) . + the standard multiplicative coalescent is the universal scaling limit of numerous stochastic ( typically combinatorial or graph - theoretic ) homogeneous ( or symmetric ) merging - like models @xcite .",
    "the `` non - standard '' eternal extreme laws from @xcite are also scaling limits of inhomogeneous random graphs and related processes under appropriate assumptions @xcite .",
    "the two nice graphical constructions for coalescents with masses were discovered early on : by aldous in @xcite for the multiplicative case , and almost simultaneously by aldous and pitman @xcite for the additive case ( here any pair of blocks of mass @xmath49 and @xmath106 merges at rate @xmath107 ) .",
    "the analogue of @xcite in the additive coalescent case is again due to aldous and pitman @xcite .",
    "no nice graphical construction for another ( merging rate ) coalescent with masses seems to have been found since . for studies of stochastic coalescents with general kernel see evans and pitman @xcite and fournier @xcite .",
    "interest for probabilistic study of related smoluchowski s equations ( with general merging kernels ) was also incited by @xcite , see for example norris @xcite , jeon @xcite , then fournier and laurenot @xcite and bertoin @xcite for more recent , and merle and normand @xcite for even more recent developments .",
    "all of the above mentioned models are _ mean - field_. see for example @xcite for studies of ( mass - less ) coalescent models in the presence of spatial structure .",
    "as already mentioned , broutin and marckert @xcite obtain theorem [ tmain ] in the standard multiplicative coalescent  case , via _",

    "their approaches seem to be quite different from the one taken here , with some notable similarities .",
    "james martin and balzs rth @xcite introduce a coalescence - fragmentation model called the _ multiplicative coalescent  with linear deletion ( mcld)_. here in addition to ( and independently of ) the multiplicative coalescence , each component is permanently removed from the system at a rate proportional to its mass ( this proportionality parameter is denoted by @xmath108 ) . in the absence of deletion ( i.e.  when @xmath109 ) , their `` tilt ( and shift ) operator '' representation of the mcld leads to an alternative proof of theorem [ tmain ] , sketched in detail in @xcite , section 6.1 ( see @xcite , corollary 6.6 ) .",
    "further comments on links and similarities to @xcite will be made along the way , most frequently in section [ s : ud ] .",
    "gernimo uribe @xcite relies on a generalization of the construction from @xcite , explains its links to armendriz representation , and works towards another derivation of theorem [ tmain ] .",
    "the arguments presented in the sequel are elementary in part due to direct applications of a non - trivial result from @xcite , section 2.6 ( depending on @xcite , section 2.5 ) in section [ s : c ] ( more precisely , corollary [ c : immediate ] ) . in comparison , ( a )",
    "@xcite also rely on the convergence results of @xcite in the standard multiplicative coalescent  setting , as well as additional estimates proved in @xcite , and ( b ) the analysis done in @xcite , sections 4 and 5 seems to be a formal analogue of that in @xcite , sections 2.5 - 2.6 .",
    "the present approach to theorem [ tmain ] is of independent interest even in the standard multiplicative coalescent  setting ( where section [ s : sl ] would simplify further , since @xmath110 , and already lemma 8 from @xcite would be sufficient for making conclusions in section [ s : c ] ) .",

    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ s : sbfw ] introduces the simultaneous breadth - first walks and explains how they are linked to the ( marginal ) law of the multiplicative coalescent , and the original breadth - first walks of @xcite .",
    "section [ s : ud ] recalls uribe s diagrams and includes proposition [ puriarm ] , that connects the diagrams to the multiplicative coalescent . in section [ s : bfwud ]",

    "( a ) apart from simultaneity , the above construction differs from the one in @xcite in one other significant way : all the @xmath118s are used `` equally '' in the definition of @xmath127 for any given @xmath95 here , while in @xcite for each @xmath95 separately , the size - biased picking of each leading vertex of a connected component to be explored was done ( and encoded ) separately . in particular , no `` load - free '' intervals exist for the analogues of @xmath234 in @xcite ( see figure 1 ) . at the moment",
    "it may seem that the main ( potential ) gain of the just described modified breadth - first construction is in `` compactifying '' the input data ( compare with @xcite section 2.3 or @xcite , section 6.1 for alternatives ) .",
    "it will become apparent in the sequel ( see proposition [ pcoro ] and section [ s : sl ] ) that this construction is quite natural , in that stronger convergence results can be obtained from it with less effort .",

    "this fact is encouraging , but can not ensure on its own that the multiplicative coalescent  marginals coupled to @xmath233 is in fact a multiplicative coalescent .",
    "moreover , while the nesting is encouraging , the following observation will likely increase the level of reader s skepticism about @xmath7 having the multiplicative coalescent  law : if @xmath242 , @xmath243 and @xmath244 are three different excursions of @xmath245 explored in the increasing order of their indices , and if the initial blocks @xmath246 are contained in the connected components matched to @xmath247 , respectively , then it is impossible that @xmath17 and @xmath248 are merged in @xmath249 without @xmath18 being merged with @xmath17 ( and therefore with @xmath248 ) in @xmath249 .",
    "if there is a simultaneous ( for all @xmath95 ) scaling limit of @xmath250 ( under well chosen hypotheses ) , the just mentioned property persists in the limit .",
    "this observation is perhaps the strongest intuitive argument pointing against the claim of proposition [ pcoro ] and theorem [ tmain ] . on the other hand ,",
    "analogous representations of the standard additive coalescent are well - known ( cf .",
    "one may be less surprised there , due to the `` cutting the crt '' dual ( from @xcite ) , and the well - known connection between the exploration process of continuum trees and forests on the one hand , and brownian excursions on the other ( cf .  @xcite ) .",
    "as nicolas broutin ( personal communication ) points out , any ( binary ) fragmentation can be formally represented as a `` stick - breaking '' process , in which the two broken pieces of any split block remain nearest neighbors ( in some arbitrary but fixed way ) .",
    "the reversed `` coalescent '' will then have the above counterintuitive property by definition .",
