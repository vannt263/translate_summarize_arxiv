    "in the recent years the art of evaluating multi - loop feynman integrals has been driven to an impressive high level and very sophisticated methods and tools have been developed in order to cope with the enormous complexity one encounters at higher orders ( see , e.g. , the recent reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "a standard practical problem is the evaluation of a class of feynman integrals corresponding to a given graph .",
    "the integrals differ by the integer powers of the propagators and the polynomials in numerators .",
    "most methods heavily rely on the use of recurrence relations derived with the help of integration - by - parts ( ibp )  @xcite identities .",
    "the recurrence relations are used to express a complicated integral in terms of simpler ones and , after repeated use , finally in terms of a small set of integrals , so - called master integrals , which can not further be reduced . only for the latter",
    "a complicated integration is possibly necessary .",
    "any dimensionally regularized feynman integral corresponding to a given graph , with the space - time dimension @xmath0 as a regularization parameter @xcite , can be represented in the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , are loop momenta , @xmath4 are integer indices , underlined letters denote multi - indices , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath5 , and the denominators are given by @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "irreducible numerators which can not be linearly expressed through the given set of the denominators @xmath8 of the propagators are naturally treated as extra denominators raised to a negative power .",
    "the momenta @xmath9 are either the loop momenta @xmath10 , or external momenta @xmath11 of the graph so that the denominators can be either quadratic or linear in the loop momenta @xmath2 .",
    "the ibp identities are obtained by applying the operator @xmath12 ( @xmath3 and @xmath13 ) to the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eqbn ] ) . due to the properties of dimensional regularization",
    "the resulting integral is zero which can symbolically be written as @xmath14 @xmath15 are polynomials in the operators that increase and lower indices , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18    the basic idea is to use the relations of eq .",
    "( [ eqrr ] ) in order to express any integral with a given value of the multi - index @xmath19 in terms of simpler integrals corresponding to some finite family of multi - indices @xmath20 , where , usually , @xmath21 consists of @xmath22 , or @xmath23 , or a negative integer value . having in mind the experience collected in the process of solving recurrence relations for various classes of feynman integrals , one may hope that , for any given class of feynman integrals , the recursion problem can be solved , _",
    "i.e. _ , any feynman integral @xmath24 , with given values of its indices , can be represented as a finite linear combination @xmath25 with the normalization condition @xmath26 the integrals @xmath27 are called _ master _ , _ basic _ or _ irreducible _ integrals . our experience tells us that the coefficient functions @xmath28 turn out to be rational functions of the dimension @xmath29 , the masses and the kinematical invariants build from the external momenta , so that the non - trivial analytical dependence of the feynman integrals on the dimensionful quantities and @xmath29 is completely contained in the master integrals .    to solve the problem of the reduction it is necessary to identify the master integrals and to construct an algorithm which allows to calculate the coefficients @xmath28 . in concrete situations ,",
    "the realization of the reduction procedure to a set of master integrals turns out to be far from straightforward .",
    "examples of recent attempts to construct systematic procedures for solving ibp recurrence relations can be found in  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to solve recurrence relations in a systematic way was developed in  @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on an appropriate integral representation for the coefficient functions @xmath28 . in the case of vacuum feynman integrals ,",
    "this representation takes the form  @xcite @xmath30^{(d - h-1)/2 } \\",
    ", ,    \\label{eqsol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parametric integrals have to fulfill the essential condition that ibp can be applied . as one can see in the examples discussed in section  [ sec : ex ] , the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eqsol ] ) can be either performed as closed contour integrals in the complex plane , or as iterated integrations over real one - dimensional domains .",
    "the latter is typically between roots of a quadratic polynomial .",
    "furthermore , if the singularity of the @xmath31-integration is given by the factor @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) it is unreasonable to choose this point as a boundary of a segment - integration as the corresponding divergence is not regularized .",
    "however , such a choice turns out to be possible if ( probably , after some intermediate integrations ) an additional factor of the type @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is integer , appears .    the basic polynomial in eq .",
    "( [ eqsol ] ) is given by  @xcite @xmath36 where the determinant is taken with respect to the indices @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "thus , @xmath39 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath40 in the variables @xmath31 and the masses .",
    "the matrix @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ basic ] ) is defined as follows : @xmath42 as introduced in eq .",
    "( [ denom ] ) is defined for @xmath43 .",
    "let us then consider the quadratic @xmath44 matrix @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 , where the first index is labeled by pairs @xmath47 with @xmath43 , and the second index is @xmath48 . the corresponding inverse matrix @xmath49 ( where again @xmath43 ) satisfies @xmath50 now @xmath41 is defined for all @xmath37 and @xmath38 as the symmetrical extension of @xmath49 .",
    "as was demonstrated in  @xcite , the representation  ( [ eqsol ] ) satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eqrr ] ) , provided one can use ibp in the parametric integrals .",
    "we should remark that the overall normalization in eq .",
    "( [ eqsol ] ) is not fixed in advance but is adjusted after the construction of the coefficient functions , as a virtue of eq .",
    "( [ eqcc1 ] ) .",
    "for the same reason , the basic polynomial is determined up to a factor which is independent of the variables @xmath31 .",
    "general feynman integrals can be reduced to the vacuum case  @xcite . in case",
    "an external momentum is reduced to a mass shell , @xmath51 ( where the mass @xmath52 is one of the internal masses of the diagram ) , one includes into the procedure all the terms of the formal taylor expansion in @xmath53 at @xmath51 . in the case of a general external momentum squared one can still consider similar terms of the taylor expansion in @xmath54 where , this time , @xmath55 is not equal to some of the internal masses .",
    "this taylor expansion is indeed a taylor series ( rather than a formal series ) because the point @xmath56 is not singular . in this situation ,",
    "one is usually interested only in the value at @xmath56 and not in the derivatives at this general point .",
    "thus for the corresponding feynman integrals one considers only the value @xmath57 of the corresponding index @xmath4 . the transition to a vacuum problem effectively increases the number of loops which enters the exponent of the basic polynomial @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eqsol ] ) where the loop number @xmath40 refers to the corresponding vacuum feynman graph .",
    "for example , in a recursive problem for a class of propagator diagrams , the transition to the corresponding vacuum problem , which is obtained after gluing the external lines , increases the loop number by one .",
    "we would like to stress that this translation to the level of vacuum feynman integrals is not necessarily accompanied by a corresponding vacuum graph .",
    "however , in the language of feynman integrals defined through eq .",
    "( [ eqbn ] ) such a description is always possible .",
    "it should be mentioned that although eq .",
    "( [ eqsol ] ) has been applied to solve ibp recurrence relations in some physical situations  @xcite no instructions how to apply this representation are available in the literature .",
    "the goal of our paper is twofold .",
    "first we shall describe how the parametric representation of eq .",
    "( [ eqsol ] ) can be used to characterize the master integrals and to construct an algorithm for evaluating the coefficients of these master integrals .",
    "second , we shall choose several typical examples to exemplify the method .",
    "as a non - trivial two - loop example , we discuss in detail the class of diagrams appearing in the calculation of the two - loop heavy quark potential .",
    "the main motivation for this is that in refs .",
    "@xcite no complete procedure has been presented but only the necessary feynman integrals were calculated .",
    "a reduction procedure is described in the thesis  @xcite which is based on ibp accompanied by the method developed in  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath58 corrections to the potential were evaluated , a standard approach to solve the ibp relations has been used and an algorithm has been developed to evaluate the adequate subclass of the diagrams . in this paper",
    "we present a complete procedure for evaluating a general diagram of this class which is certainly useful if higher dimensional operators are considered within the framework of non - relativistic qcd .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in the next section , we discuss the identification of the master integrals and present general prescriptions for applying eq .",
    "( [ eqsol ] ) . in section  [ sec : ex ] , we discuss the one- and two - loop examples and , finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section we present practical prescriptions to perform a reduction procedure with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eqsol ] ) .",
    "we shall assume that any feynman integral can be decomposed according to eqs .",
    "( [ eqcc ] ) and  ( [ eqcc1 ] ) .",
    "the method decomposes into two parts : the classification of the master integrals and the construction of the coefficient functions .",
    "let us in a first step consider the integrals where the indices corresponding to irreducible numerators are set to zero .",
    "the other indices we allow to be either zero or one . in the following we nullify all scaleless integrals ( e.g. , massless tadpoles ) which is natural within the framework of dimensional regularization .    before analyzing the remaining non - zero integrals with the indices one and zero , let us remember that the goal of every known reduction is to reduce some of the indices to zero .",
    "indeed , experience tells us that a master integral @xmath59 never appears in the reduction of a given feynman integral @xmath60 if @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for this reason we adopt the following natural condition for the coefficient function @xmath63 of @xmath59 : @xmath64 this condition is easily realized in an automatic way by choosing the integration domain for @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eqsol ] ) as a closed contour around the origin in the complex @xmath65-plane , which from now on will always be implied . as a consequence , the integration over the variables @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eqsol ] ) , where @xmath66 in the corresponding master integral , is performed with the help of the cauchy theorem and thus reduces to taylor expansions of order @xmath67 of the integrand in @xmath65 . eventually , eq .  ( [ eqsol ] )",
    "results in a sum of terms of the form @xmath68^{z - n_d } \\",

    "let us now analyze the remaining candidates in view of being master integrals with the help of the representation  ( [ eqsol1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath74 for a given candidate @xmath59 ( _ i.e. _ , for @xmath75 with @xmath66 or @xmath76 ) it is naturally to put the corresponding coefficient function to zero . in other words ,",
    "such a feynman integral is recognized as a reducible integral in the sense of the reduction problem .",
    "this is the simplest condition of reducibility .",
    "a more general condition is that any resulting integral of eq .",
    "( [ eqsol1 ] ) involves an integral without scale . in this situation",
    "it is natural to prescribe a zero value for it and , therefore , consider the given feynman integral @xmath59 as reducible in the sense of the reduction problem and the corresponding decomposition given in eq .",
    "( [ eqcc ] ) .",
    "it can happen that a scaleless integral in eq .",
    "( [ eqsol ] ) can either be seen immediately , _",
    "i.e. _ , an integral over a `` pure '' power of some variable arises , or only after some intermediate integrations .    after trying all possible combinations of zero and one",
    "we obtain a list of master integrals , which fixes the terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqcc ] ) .",
    "however , this is not all .",
    "sometimes , in addition to a given master integral @xmath59 with @xmath75 consisting of @xmath66 or @xmath77 , one has to consider master integrals which differ from @xmath59 by some indices @xmath78 .",
    "the number of such additional master integrals is dictated by the degree of the polynomial @xmath79 with respect to some of the parameters @xmath65 . in practice it turns out to be advantageous to complete the list of the master integrals in the second step where algorithms for the computation of the coefficient functions @xmath63 are constructed .",
    "sometimes it is obvious that a given candidate is reducible due to other arguments like the simple application of the triangle rule .",
    "however , it turns out to be rather convenient to see this property directly by analyzing the corresponding `` reduced '' polynomial @xmath79 , as this provides a useful additional check .",
    "the set of the master integrals with the indices zero and one as obtained in the previous subsection is partially ordered in the natural way .",
    "we write @xmath80 if @xmath81 for all @xmath38 and the strict inequality holds at least for one index . in this way",
    "all master integrals can be grouped into so - called families which are by definition disjoint . as we will see below this ordering",
    "is crucial in the construction of the coefficient functions .",
    "let us start from the master integrals which have the most non - zero indices where only indices corresponding to the propagators but not to the numerators are counted .",
    "these integrals are maximal in the sense of the hierarchy defined above . for a maximal master integral @xmath59 , the corresponding coefficient function @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ eqcc ] ) is replaced by the corresponding parametric integral  ( [ eqsol ] ) which results in a sum of terms as given in eq .",
    "( [ eqsol1 ] ) according to our agreement of choosing integration contours for the variables associated with the indices equal to one .",
    "we want to stress that only those integrations over @xmath31 are non - trivial where the corresponding index of the master integral is zero .",
    "experience shows that these remaining integration can be performed in terms of gamma functions , for the general integer values of the indices .. ] at this point one applies eq .",
    "( [ eqcc1 ] ) to normalize the resulting expression .",
    "let us now suppose that we are dealing with a master integral which is not maximal , _",
    "i.e. _ , we have two master integrals which fulfill the hierarchy @xmath82 .",
    "this means that if @xmath83 we have also @xmath84 . to construct an algorithm for the coefficient function @xmath85 we start with the case of negative indices @xmath86 for those indices @xmath38 where @xmath84 as in this case we have @xmath87 .",
    "experience shows that the integrations for @xmath88 result in ratios of gamma functions which in particular can be used to obtain @xmath89 . in a next step one",
    "considers the case @xmath90 .",
    "then the corresponding parametric representation  ( [ eqsol ] ) usually leads to integrals ( cf .",
    "( [ eqsol1 ] ) ) which can not be evaluated in gamma functions .",
    "thus at first sight it looks hopeless to achieve that the coefficient functions have to be rational functions of @xmath29 ( and eventually other dimensionful quantities ) .",
    "the way out of this problem is as follows : actually we have to look for an expression for the coefficient function @xmath88 which is a linear combination of @xmath91 and the representation  ( [ eqsol ] ) for @xmath85 . denoting the latter by @xmath92 one",
    "has @xmath93 where the constant @xmath45 is determined by the condition @xmath94 ( cf .",
    "( [ eqcc1 ] ) ) and is thus given by @xmath95    at this stage it turns out that it is advantageous to use ibp applied to the parametric integrals of eq .",
    "( [ eqsol1 ] ) .",
    "note that the complexity is significantly reduced as compared to the original integral simply because there are much less variables involved .",
    "the basic idea is to express any given parametric integral in terms of auxiliary ( parametric ) master integrals and expressions which are straightforwardly evaluated in gamma functions .",
    "the dependence on the new auxiliary master integrals has to drop out in order to guarantee that the coefficient functions are rational functions of @xmath29 ( and eventually the other dimensionful parameters ) .",
    "such a cancellation turns to be a good check of the algorithm .",
    "this is similar to the cancellation of spurious poles when applying general prescriptions for asymptotic expansion of feynman integrals in various limits of momenta and masses  @xcite . in our particular example of a hierarchy of two",
    "master integrals one presumably only needs one auxiliary parametric master integral .    for a generic tower of master",
    "integrals the construction and cancellation of the auxiliary master integrals goes along the same lines . when constructing the corresponding coefficient function one uses a linear combination of the coefficient under consideration and all coefficients of the higher master integrals .",
    "the constants are determined with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eqcc1 ] ) .",
    "explicit examples can be found in section  [ sec : ex ] .",
    "let us stress again that in general it is rather simple to compute the coefficient function of a maximal master integral as it has many indices equal to one .",
    "on the other hand , following the procedure described above , it is possible to either reduce the indices of the coefficient of a non - maximal master integral in order to make an evaluation in @xmath96 functions possible , or relate it to the coefficient functions of higher master integrals .",
    "this is achied with the help of ibp applied to the parametric integrals over the @xmath97parameters .    at this point",
    "it may happen that the initial list of the master integrals obtained in section  [ sub : id ] is not sufficient and has to be extended by additional master integrals where some of the indices are negative .",
    "this necessity is connected to the type of solution of the recursive problem for the auxiliary parametric integrals and thus to the basic polynomial @xmath72 .",
    "we consider the construction of a coefficient functions as completed if for given indices an algorithm ( usually realized on a computer ) for its evaluation is provided .",
    "however , in simple situations , one can even obtain explicit expressions for the coefficients as functions of the indices .",
    "after we have obtained the list of the master integrals it is reasonable to check whether there are identical expressions among them , although they all have appeared in a different way .",
    "if some of the master integrals within one family are equal simply because the corresponding integrals are identical , e.g. , due to some symmetry , it is natural to consider one master integral instead .",
    "the corresponding coefficient function is the sum of the coefficient functions of the original integrals . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the best solution would be to achieve the absolute minimal number of the master integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eqcc ] ) . however , for practical purposes , this is not very important .",
    "finally let us note that it is possible to identify an integral as master and then immediately construct an algorithm for the corresponding coefficient function , rather than strictly decompose the procedure into the two steps as described above .",
    "let us start with the simple example of a massless one - loop diagram with one external momentum ( a so - called propagator diagram ) which is given by ( see also fig .",

    "are implied . according to @xcite",
    ", the transition to the corresponding vacuum problem reduces to adding a new propagator , @xmath100 , with some mass squared @xmath101 .",
    "furthermore one has @xmath102 .",
    "we want to consider the value of our diagram at some general point and are not interested in higher terms of the taylor expansion in @xmath103 .",
    "therefore we consider only the index @xmath104 corresponding to the additional propagator .",
    "the integration contour for the corresponding variable @xmath105 is taken as a cauchy contour around the origin .",
    "thus we write down the corresponding basic polynomial ( [ basic ] ) and reduce it by setting @xmath106 .",
