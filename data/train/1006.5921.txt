    "a very interesting problem in studying society and social dynamics is the one of `` opinion formation '' , which is a collective dynamical phenomenon , and as such are closely related to problems of competing cultures or languages @xcite .",
    "it deals with a `` measurable '' response of the society to e.g. , political issues , acceptances of innovations , etc .",
    "a number of models of competing options have been introduced to study it , e.g. , the `` voter '' model ( which has a binary opinion variable with the opinion alignment proceeding by a random choice of neighbors ) @xcite , or the sznajd - weron discrete opinion formation model ( where more than just a pair of spins is associated with the decision making procedure ) @xcite .",
    "there have been studies of systems with more than just two possible opinions @xcite , or where the opinion of individuals is represented by a `` continuous '' variable @xcite . since opinion formation in a human society",
    "is mediated by social interactions between individuals , such social dynamics was considered to take place on a network of relationships by holme and newman @xcite .",
    "several other significant studies have followed , which we not not mention here .",
    "a two body exchange dynamics has already been developed in the context of modelling income , money or wealth distributions in a society @xcite .",
    "detailed analytical structure of the collective dynamics in these models are now considerably well - developed @xcite . here",
    ", we propose a minimally modified version of those models for the collective dynamics of opinion formation in the society .",
    "recently physicists and mathematicians have been interested in studying the wealth distributions in a closed economy using kinetic exchange mechanism , which has led to new insights into this field ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the general aim was to study a many - agent statistical model of closed economy ( analogous to the kinetic theory model of ideal gases ) @xcite , where @xmath0 agents exchange a quantity @xmath1 , that may be defined as wealth .",
    "the states of agents are characterized by the wealth @xmath2 , and the total wealth @xmath3 is conserved .",
    "the question of interest is : `` what is the equilibrium distribution of wealth @xmath4 , such that @xmath5 is the probability that in the steady state of the system , a randomly chosen agent will be found to have wealth between @xmath1 and @xmath6 ? ''",
    "the evolution of the system is carried out according to a prescription , which defines the trading rule between agents , where the agents interact with each other through a pair - wise interaction characterized by a saving parameter @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "the dynamics of the model ( cc ) is as follows @xcite : @xmath9 it can be noticed that in this way , the quantity @xmath1 is conserved during the single transactions : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the agent wealths after the transaction has taken place .",
    "this model for @xmath13 leads to an equilibrium distribution , with a mode @xmath14 and a zero limit for small @xmath1 . for @xmath15",
    ", the model reproduces the results of yakovenko @xcite , where the equilibrium distribution is the gibb s distribution . in general ,",
    "the functional form for such distributions was conjectured to be a @xmath16-distribution on the basis of an analogy with the kinetic theory of gases : @xmath17 where @xmath18 indeed , starting from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution for the particle velocity in a @xmath19 dimensional gas , it can be shown that the equilibrium kinetic energy distribution coincides with the gamma - distribution with @xmath20 .",
    "this conjecture is remarkably consistent with the fitting provided to numerical data @xcite .    as a further generalization",
    ", the agents could be assigned different saving propensities @xmath21 @xcite . in particular ,",
    "uniformly distributed @xmath21 in the interval @xmath22 had been studied numerically in refs .",
    "@xcite . this model ( ccm )",
    "is described by the trading rule @xmath23 \\ , ,    \\nonumber \\\\",
    "x_j ' & = &    \\lambda_j x_j + ( 1-\\epsilon ) [ ( 1-\\lambda_i ) x_i + ( 1-\\lambda_j ) x_j ] \\ , .",
    "\\label{sp2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one of the main features of this model , which is supported by theoretical considerations @xcite , is that the wealth distribution exhibits a robust power - law at large values of @xmath1 , @xmath24 with a pareto exponent @xmath25 largely independent of the details of the @xmath7-distribution . note that other values of exponents can also be generated by modifying the exchange rules @xcite .",
    "toscani @xcite had recently introduced and discussed kinetic models of ( continuous ) opinion formation involving both exchange of opinion between individual agents and diffusion of information .",
    "he showed that there are conditions which ensure that the kinetic model reaches non - trivial stationary states in case of lack of diffusion in correspondence of some opinion point , and obtained analytical results by considering a suitable asymptotic limit of the model yielding a fokker - planck equation for the distribution of opinion among individuals .",
    "based on this model , during et al @xcite proposed another mathematical model for opinion formation in a society that is built of two groups , one group of ` ordinary ' people and one group of ` strong opinion leaders ' .",
    "starting from microscopic interactions among individuals , they arrived at a macroscopic description of the opinion formation process that is characterized by a system of fokker  planck - type equations .",
    "they discussed the steady states of the system , and extended it to incorporate emergence and decline of opinion leaders . on a different approach ,",
    "iniguez et al @xcite examined a situation in which these non - identical individuals form their opinions in information - transferring interactions with others .",
    "they developed a dynamic network model , where they consider short range interactions for direct discussions between pairs of individuals , long range interactions for sensing the overall opinion modulated by the attitude of an individual , and external field for outside influence .",
    "following the cc and ccm models , described in the earlier section , we now propose a minimal model for the collective dynamics of opinion @xmath26 of the @xmath27-th person in the society of @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) persons :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 for all @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and @xmath34 s are _ quenched _ variables ( do not change with time , but vary from person to person ) , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are _ annealed _ variables ( change with time ) , that are random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .     and @xmath37 with opinions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , cause the update of opinions @xmath40 and @xmath41 . ]",
    "the above described model dynamics , follows the two - body `` discussions / arguments '' modelled as _ scattering processes _ and depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange ] .",
    "it is based on the logic that during the discussion / argument event with any person @xmath37 , the person @xmath27 with high / low `` conviction '' ( parametrized by the @xmath21 ) , will _ retain _ his / her own earlier opinion @xmath42 proportional to the factor @xmath21 , and be _ influenced _ to change the opinion by the @xmath43-th person s influence determined by a contribution which will depend on the @xmath43-th person s conviction @xmath44 ( and not by the factor @xmath45 as in market dynamics eq .",
    "[ sp1 ] or [ sp2 ] ) . also , as _ no conservation in opinion is possible _",
    "( unlike in the market models above ) , the annealed variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 are now considered to be _ uncorrelated_. additionally we assume that @xmath46 , for all @xmath27 and @xmath47 .      when we assume @xmath48 for all @xmath32 ( equivalent to the cc model for market dynamics ) , the above equations reduce to @xmath49 this leads to an intriguing _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ transition beyond a threshold value of @xmath50 . specifically , following the above dynamics , starting from random ( drawn uniformly ) positive and negative values of @xmath51 ( at @xmath52 ) ( `` symmetric '' state , when the _ order parameter _",
    "@xmath53 ) , leads the system to collectively evolving to two kinds of state :    1 .",
    "`` para '' or `` indifferent '' state , where @xmath42 s are _ all _ zeros ( @xmath54 ) after a `` relaxation '' time @xmath55 , for @xmath7 values less than @xmath56 ; or 2 .",
    "`` symmetry broken '' or `` polarised '' state , where @xmath42 s are either all positive or all negative ( @xmath57 ) after a `` relaxation '' time @xmath55 , for @xmath58 .",
    "one can easily see that for @xmath7 values less than @xmath59 , with @xmath60 , the recursion relation for the _ order parameter _",
    "@xmath61 becomes a simple multipler equation with the value of the multiplier less than unity , leading to @xmath54 eventually . for higher values of @xmath7 ,",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath35 are important ( and can not be replaced by its simple average , as above ) because of asymmetric contributions from the second term of both the above equations ( if the contribution of the second term in eq .",
    "[ op2 ] takes the value of @xmath62 to greater than unity , only partial contribution of the second term is accepted , while for its lower values the acceptance is full ) .",
    "we find , this seemingly leads to a _ discontinous _ or `` first order '' symmetry breaking transition at @xmath63 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phase ] ) .",
    "the details of this transition will be reported elsewhere @xcite .     against @xmath7 .",
    "]      here , we assume @xmath21 s to be uniformly spread in the interval [ 0,1 ) ( equivalent to the ccm model for market dynamics ) .",
    "we study similarly , starting from `` symmetric '' states ( with random positive and negative values of @xmath51 , the evolution of the system .",
    "the dynamics here leads collectively to the `` polarized '' or  symmetry broken \"",
    "state ( @xmath42 are either all positive or all negative , for all @xmath32 , and times @xmath64 ) only .",
    "the `` indifferent '' states ( with @xmath65 for all @xmath32 , for times @xmath64 ) disappear in the large system size limit , although this is clearly a _ fixed point _ of the dynamics given by eq .",
    "we believe , this is also a clear feature of the opinion dynamics model proposed by iniguez et al @xcite , where also this state is surely a fixed point of their model .",
    "it may be noted that the above dynamics can be considerably modified by the presence of `` polarizing field '' terms @xmath66 ( fixed over time @xmath47 but dependent on person @xmath27 ) , added linearly to the dynamical equations eq .",

    "such `` fields '' can be provided by the `` influences '' of the media in the society .",

    "the appearance of spontaneous symmetry breaking in this kinetic opinion exchange model is truely remarkable .",
    "it appears to be one of the simplest collective dynamical model of many - body dynamics showing non - trivial phase transition behaviour .",
