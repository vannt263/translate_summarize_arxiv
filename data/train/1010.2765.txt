    "study of the meson - nucleon reactions is one of the most important research topics associated with modern accelerators like cebaf at jefferson laboratory , and defines new challenges for theoretical models .",
    "although the electroproduction of nucleon resonances ( @xmath5 ) is expected to be governed by the short range interaction of quarks and gluons , i.e. , perturbative qcd , at low and intermediate four - momentum transfer squared @xmath4 , one has to rely on some effective and phenomenological approaches such as constituent quark models .    the roper [ @xmath3 ] resonance is particularly interesting among the many experimentally observed nucleon resonances .",
    "although usual quark models predict the roper state as the first radial excitation of the nucleon , they usually result to give a much larger mass than the experimentally observed mass  @xcite .",
    "experimentally the roper has a large width which implies that it can be a @xmath7 or @xmath8 molecular - like system , or alternatively , a system of a confined three - quark core surrounded by a large amount of meson clouds . the system can be studied using dynamical coupled channel models for the meson - nucleon reactions  @xcite .    to describe the @xmath2 transition , we use a covariant spectator model  @xcite .",
    "the model has been successfully applied to the nucleon  @xcite and @xmath9 systems  @xcite .",
    "a particular interest of this work is the model for the nucleon  @xcite . in the covariant spectator quark model a baryon",
    "is described as a three - valence quark system with an on - shell quark - pair or diquark with mass @xmath10 , while the remaining quark is off - shell and free to interact with the electromagnetic fields .",
    "the quark - diquark vertex is represented by a baryon @xmath11 wave function @xmath12 that effectively describes quark confinement  @xcite . to represent the nucleon system",
    ", we adopt the simplest structure given by a symmetric and antisymmetric combination of the diquark states combined to a relative s - state with the remaining quark  @xcite : _",
    "n= _ n(p , k ) [ eqpsin ] where @xmath13 [ @xmath14 is the spin [ isospin ] state which corresponds to the diquark with the quantum number 0 or 1 .",
    "the function @xmath15 is a scalar wave function which depends exclusively on @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the baryon ( diquark ) momentum .",
    "as the roper shares the same spin and isospin quantum numbers with the nucleon its wave function @xmath19 can also be represented by eq .",
    "( [ eqpsin ] ) except for the scalar wave function @xmath20 .",
    "the constituent quark electromagnetic current in the model is described by j_i^= ( f_1 + + f_1- _ 3 ) ( ^- ) + ( f_2 + + f_2- _ 3 ) j_2 , where @xmath21 is the nucleon mass and @xmath22 is the isospin operator . to parameterize the electromagnetic structure of the constituent quark in terms of the quark form factors @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we adopt a vector meson dominance based parametrization given by two vector meson poles : a light one corresponds to the @xmath25 or @xmath26 vector meson , and the heavier one corresponds to an effective heavy meson with mass @xmath27 to take accounts of the short range phenomenology .",
    "this parametrization allows us to extend the model for other regimes such as lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 transition in the model is described by a relativistic impulse approximation in terms of the initial @xmath29 and final @xmath30 baryon momenta , with the diquark ( spectator ) on - mass - shell  @xcite : j^&= & 3 _",

    "the factor 3 is due to the flavor symmetry . in the second line",
    "the transition form factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 are defined independent of the frame using the dirac spinors of the roper ( @xmath38 ) and nucleon ( @xmath39 ) with the respective masses @xmath40 and @xmath21 . for simplicity",

    "therefore , the results are genuine predictions .",

    "coupled channel models  @xcite the roper appears as a heavy bare system ( @xmath57 1.750 mev ) dressed by meson clouds that reduce the mass of the system to near the observed mass ( @xmath57 1.440 mev ) . to explore further this reduction of mass due to the meson clouds",
    ", we replace the physical mass by the bare mass .",
    "the result is indicated by the dotted line . as one can observe from the figure the effect due to",
    "the roper bare mass is small although it approaches very slightly to the data .",
    "the disagreement in the low @xmath4 region in fig .",
    "[ roper ] can be interpreted as a limitation of the approach , since only valence quark effects have been included , but not the quark - antiquark , or meson cloud effects .",
    "the meson cloud effects are expected to be important in the low @xmath4 region  @xcite .",
    "this argument is supported by the fact that when the model extended to a heavy pion mass lattice qcd regime , where the meson cloud effect is suppressed , since the result agrees well the heavy pion mass lattice data  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the meson cloud contributions in inelastic reactions was also observed in the @xmath58 reaction  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the covariant spectator quark model can describe both the lattice and physical data  @xcite .",
    "based on the successes in describing the heavy pion mass lattice qcd data and the high @xmath4 region data , we have some confidence that the model can describe well the valence quark contributions .",
    "thus , we can use the spectator quark model to estimate the meson cloud contributions .    to estimate the meson cloud contributions , we decompose the form factors as , f_i^(q^2)= f_i^b ( q^2 ) + f_i^mc(q^2 ) ( i=1,2 ) , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 represent the valence quark ( bare ) and meson cloud contributions , respectively .",
    "this decomposition is justified if the meson is created by the overall baryon but not by a single quark in the baryon core .",
    "replacing @xmath59 by the result of the spectator quark model , one can estimate the meson cloud contributions in the @xmath2 transition .",
    "we estimate the meson cloud contributions in two different ways as presented in fig .",
    "[ amp ] ( left panel ) .",
    "one is based on the maid fit made for the whole @xmath4 region , and estimates the bands associated with the meson cloud assuming the uncertainty of the clas data points ( red region ) .",
    "the other estimate is from clas data for each data point by subtracting the valence quark contribution .",
    "the results are represented by circles .",
    "similarly , the meson cloud contributions can be determined for the helicity amplitudes , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , associated with the photon polarizations of @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively . representing the corresponding amplitudes by @xmath65 and @xmath62 , respectively , one can obtain the meson cloud contributions : r^mc(q^2)= r(q^2 ) - r^b(q^2 ) .",
    "the results are also shown in fig .  [ amp ] ( right panel ) .",
    "both methods suggest the significant meson cloud effects for low @xmath4 region ( @xmath66 gev@xmath56 ) , and a fast falloff with increasing @xmath4 .    in conclusion , the spectator quark model can be effectively applied to study the nucleon resonances , particularly in the intermediate and high @xmath4 region , where the valence quark effects are dominant , and both the relativity and covariance are essential .",
