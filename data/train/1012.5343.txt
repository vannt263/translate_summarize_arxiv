    "organisms adapt to their environment by sequential fixation of beneficial mutations .",
    "this process is often visualized as motion of a population ( specified by multi - dimensional genomic variables corresponding to the dominant genotype in the population ) in the fitness landscape , where the height of the landscape corresponds to the reproductive fitness of an average individual in the population @xcite .",
    "fitness landscapes are believed to be rough with many local maxima , and a population may get stuck in one , so that every plausible mutation is deleterious . in such cases adaptation to a global fitness maximum",
    "requires the fixation of deleterious mutations , which is rare .",
    "even when there is a path of only neutral or weakly selective mutations to the global optimum , it may be difficult to find it , and navigating such paths can be slow due to the low fixation probability ( @xmath0 for a population of @xmath1 individuals for a neutral mutation  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been recognized that temporal fluctuations in the fitness landscape can drive the population out of a local fitness maximum .",
    "for example , the maximum of fitness at one time may be on a fitness slope at another time , allowing the population to leave the area .",
    "such connections between the fluctuating selective pressure , the population size , and the population - genetics dynamics have been studied extensively @xcite , starting with the introduction of the concept of adaptive topography by wright @xcite .",
    "more recently the evolutionary dynamics of density regulated populations in fluctuating environments have been elucidated in more ecologically realistic models @xcite , bridging the gap between the classical population dynamics @xcite and the population genetics models .    in a recent pioneering numerical evolution experiment @xcite",
    ", these ideas were further developed to show that certain type of fluctuating environmental pressures speed up evolution many times in a particular model .",
    "however , it remains unknown to what extent these results generalize .",
    "is the speedup a general property ?",
    "how does it depend on the spatiotemporal structure of the fluctuating environment ?",
    "can a population escape any local maximum ?",
    "how does the motion in the genotype space depend on time ?",
    "do fitness fluctuations have to be dramatic , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , or can small fluctuations still speed the evolution up ?    in this article , we answer some of these questions in the context of a model of evolutionary dynamics that is simple enough to allow a thorough analytical and numerical treatment , but is at the same time general enough so that at least some of our predictions hold for a wide class of evolutionary models .",
    "we consider the limit of a weak mutation rate , when the time scales are well separated .",
    "the time between successive mutations is slower that the typical fixation time , and the characteristic time scale of the fitness landscape changes is the longest .",
    "further , we assume a constant population size , so that the evolutionary dynamics depends only on the relative fitness differences between the genotypes .",
    "we consider adaptation in a highly epistatic genotypic space , such that the evolution takes place on a one dimensional pathway with large , local fitness differences . under these assumptions , we show that the evolutionary search can be sped up substantially when only a small component of the fitness landscape undergoes temporal variations .",
    "our model of a fluctuating environment is based on an overdamped langevin particle in a potential .",
    "the position @xmath2 is some generalized coordinate that describes the dominant genotype in the population , and hence a change in @xmath2 is a fixation event .",
    "this genotype changes with the velocity given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the potential , @xmath5 is the friction , @xmath6 is a white gaussian noise with the variance @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the intrinsic diffusivity .",
    "notice that in the usual physics language , the process will minimize the potential so that @xmath4 is the negative fitness .",
    "motion to minimize @xmath4 represents fixation of beneficial mutations , while langevin noise allows low probability fixation of neutral and deleterious mutations . the first phenomenon is called natural selection / drift in evolutionary / physics languages , and the second is unfortunately referred to as drift / diffusion , respectively . to avoid confusion , in the remainder of the article we use the physics terminology .",
    "we write the potential as @xmath9 and we focus on the following range of parameters : @xmath10-\\min[\\phi(x)]\\ll \\max[u_0(x)]-\\min[u_0(x)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this models the emergence of novel functions in a population .",
    "namely , the fitness is largely independent of time , as described by @xmath11 .",
    "however , small temporal changes in fitness are allowed .",
    "for example , acquiring an enzyme that can metabolize a certain chemical is generally advantageous if the chemical is present , but somewhat deleterious if it is absent , so that the investment into production of the enzyme can not recovered .",
    "we model this by adding the small fitness component @xmath12 that fluctuates as @xmath13 , representing , for example , changes in the availability of the metabolite due to seasonal or geological variations .",
    "finally , we choose to separate the global , almost non - epistatic , fitness from the local , possibly highly - epistatic ( but small ) effects by making the gradient of @xmath11 smaller than that of @xmath14 , even though the scale of @xmath14 itself is smaller than that of @xmath11 .    with the conditions above , we can redefine @xmath11 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 without much loss of generality , so that @xmath16 .",
    "we then consider the simplest form of @xmath12 and @xmath13 that satisfy these conditions , and we will discuss how our results generalize to other forms of the functions in section [ discussion ] .",
    "namely , we choose @xmath14 to be a zero - mean periodic saw - tooth potential , and @xmath15 to be a zero - mean periodic telegraph signal .",
    "these considerations allow us to write near a particular point @xmath2 in the genotype space @xmath17,\\\\    & s(t)\\equiv{\\rm sign}\\left[\\sin \\frac{\\pi t}{t}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the intrinsic drift or bias , defined as positive for the drift to the right , see fig .

    "we always assume that @xmath19 , so that the fluctuating component of the potential can actually create local maxima and minima on top of the global landscape @xmath20 . in what follows",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the time between subsequent potential flips ( the half - period of the fluctuations ) , and @xmath22 is half of the spatial period .",
    "this model is similar to various stochastic ratchets considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "thus , intuitively , the question of whether the fitness fluctuations can speed up the evolutionary search is a question similar to whether a rectified or a high - variance motion can appear due to ratcheting .     at a fixed time .",
