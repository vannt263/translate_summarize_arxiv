    "the system v635 cas/4u  0115 + 63 is a be x - ray binary star system ( bexrb ) with a 3.61s spin period and a 24.3 day orbital period ( cominsky et al . 1978 ; rappaport et al .",
    "the optical counterpart , v635 cas , was tentatively classified as a early type be star based on its optical colours and the presence of variable h@xmath1 and occasional h@xmath2 emission ( johns et al . 1978 ; kriss et al . 1983",
    "; hutchings & crampton 1981 ) .",
    "the temporal evolution of v635 cas is very different from that of other bexrbs .",
    "the x - ray outbursts from the neutron star are varied in strength but typically last for a month .",
    "the associated optical and infrared activity is far more prolonged , lasting typically @xmath36 months . unlike many bexrbs the peak in the x - ray flux is not centred on periastron passage",
    "this suggests that it is the episodic equatorial mass loss from the companion star which is the trigger for each outburst .",
    "mendelson & mazeh ( 1991 ) concluded that x - ray outbursts occur when the optical outburst is relatively long ( @xmath3200 days ) and strong ( @xmath31 mag ) .",
    "x - ray emission during weaker optical outbursts is not seen due to centrifugal inhibition of matter and the propeller effect ( kriss et al .",
    "1983 ; mendelson & mazeh 1991 ) .",
    "negueruela et al .",
    "( 1997 , paper i ) discuss the may - june 1994 x - ray outburst in the context of long term observations of v635 cas .",
    "we conclude that the large variations in optical luminosity originate in the be circumstellar envelope and not an accretion disk around the neutron star .",
    "the orbit of the neutron star is relatively close to the companion and its gravitational pull may play an important role in the evolution of the circumstellar disk .    in this paper",
    "we present two data sets that can be used to constrain the physical and geometric models for the circumstellar disk .",
    "the companion s spectral type is a critical parameter for modelling the disk .",
    "however this is hard to derive as many of the companion stars in the bexrbs are faint and the photospheric lines are often filled in with disk emission .",
    "many of the systems have a spectral classification based on optical colours . in sect .",
    "3.1 we present the first blue spectra of v635 cas with sufficient signal to noise to derive a spectral class .    the disks in oe / be stars are highly variable .",
    "we need a database of high quality data in order to model the evolution of the disk size , temperature and density . in sect .",
    "3.2 we present the first far red optical spectra obtained for this system .",
    "the spectra were obtained in service mode with the william herschel telescope , la palma using isis with the tek ccd camera and the r600b ( 0.79   pixel@xmath4 dispersion , 1.6   pixel@xmath4 resolution , range @xmath5 6350 - 6750  ) and r1200r ( 0.41   pixel@xmath4 dispersion , 0.8   pixel@xmath4 resolution , range @xmath6 3900 - 4700  ) gratings ( carter et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the simultaneous observations of allowed us to assess any emission component that may be present in the bluer balmer lines .",
    "was in emission at this time , see paper i.    v635 cas was observed over two nights ( 900s and 2@xmath71500s on 1993 december 18 and 2@xmath71000s on 1993 december 19 ) .",
    "the flux standard hiltner 102 was also observed ( 300s on 1993 december 18 ) .",
    "the seeing was poor on 1993 december 18 .",
    "the data were reduced using the figaro and dipso packages ( shortridge & meyerdicks 1996 ; howarth 1996 ) .",
    "figure 1 is a plot of v635 cas ( upper ) and hiltner 102 ( lower ) obtained on 1993 december 19 and 18 , respectively .",
    "the data have been smoothed with a gaussian ( @xmath8 = 2 , width = 5 pixels , 1 pixel = 0.8  ) . to normalise the spectra we fitted a third order polynomial to the continuum and then divided the spectra by this fit .",
    "the far red spectra ( @xmath5 64008900  , 5   pixel@xmath4 dispersion , 11   resolution ) were obtained using the all - transmission mark iiia spectrograph on the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope at michigan - dartmouth - mit observatory , kitt peak , arizona . the detector was a ti-4849 ccd , inside the bricc camera ( luppino 1989 ) , except on 1991 october 27 , when a thomson chip was used .",
    "all spectra were taken through a 2.2@xmath9 slit , with exposure times of 1800 s. there was cirrus on 1991 october 20 .",
    "spectra of hot stars were taken to map the telluric atmospheric bands in this part of the spectrum , which were removed using the methods of wade & horne ( 1988 ) .",
    "there is a wrinkle in the spectra at 7600   due to the removal of the a - band which is the strongest atmospheric feature .",
    "there is also an atmospheric absorption band in the region p11 to p7 .",
    "each time a spectrum of v635 cas was taken , one spectrum each of two flux standards were also taken . these were g191b2b ( oke 1974 ) and hd 19445 ( oke & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "comparing the individual spectra of these standards , taken at different epochs , we found the relative fluxes in the spectra to be consistent to within a few percent .",
    "errors in relative fluxes due to losses from an unrotated slit were therefore not serious , unsurprising since these spectra are all so red ( filippenko 1982 ) .",
    "absolute fluxes were another matter : we estimate from the same spectra that the absolute flux levels should not be trusted to within 30% .",
    "although this will effect flux measurements of the lines , it will not affect equivalent width or velocity measurements .",
    "the instrumental uncertainties do not account for the upturn in the spectrum on 1991 october 27 and we believe this to be real .    the @xmath5 6400  7500   and @xmath5 7600  8900   spectra are given in fig .",
    "the 1991 october 20 spectrum has been normalised to the continuum value at 7264   as the night was not photometric .",
    "tables 2 and 3 list the dereddened line fluxes .",
    "the spectra were dereddened assuming a standard galactic extinction law ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ; howarth 1983 ) and @xmath10 ( hutchings & crampton 1981 ) .",
    ".the observed lines in the far red ccd spectra [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     @xmath11 tjd = jd @xmath12 2440000 ; @xmath13 flux",

    "@xmath16 blended , see table 1 .",
    "the spectral class of v635 cas was determined by comparison with hiltner 102 and the standards published by walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 ) .",
    "the walborn ( 1971 ) scheme hinges on the ratios of neutral and singly - ionised helium and the first three ions of silicon",
    ".    the comparison with the standard star hiltner 102 which is identified as a b0 iii in the simbad database led us to reclassify hiltner 102 as a o9.7 ii star .",
    "the spectral classification was based on the heii @xmath17 4541 / hei @xmath17 4387   and the heii @xmath184200 / hei @xmath17 4144   ratios . for an o 9.7 star the strength of the heii @xmath17 4541   @xmath3 siiii @xmath184552  .",
    "the luminosity class was determined from the siv @xmath184089 / hei @xmath5 4026 , 4121 , 4144   and the siiv @xmath17 4116 / hei @xmath17 4121   ratios .",
    "hiltner 102 may have a slight nitrogen enhancement .",
    "v635 cas is harder to classify due to two factors .",
    "it is fainter than hiltner 102 ( @xmath19 vs. hiltner 102 , @xmath20 ) and the disk emission causes the filling in of the bluer singly ionized hydrogen and helium lines .",
    "for example the filling in is evident in h@xmath21 @xmath17 4340  .",
    "in addition the heii lines appear to be filled in . the strong heii @xmath17 4200",
    "  absorption indicates that the star is earlier that previously assumed based on its optical colours : it is an 09e star .",
    "no far red optical spectra have been previously published for v635 cas .",
    "dramatic spectral variability occurred .",
    "the line changed from emission to absorption on a timescale of four months or less ( unger 1993 ) .",
    "this is the first time that a phase change has been seen in this system . the phase change was also reflected in the paschen and he  i lines and by the low in the @xmath22 lightcurve .",
    "we interpreted this as a disk loss event which was discussed by unger ( 1993 ) and in paper i. here we will interpret the emission line data .    with sufficient resolution many of the emission lines in be stars are double peaked .",
    "huang ( 1972 ) interpreted this in terms of a simple model consisting of a disc rotating about the star .",
    "the outer radius of the emission region can be estimated using the ratio of the peak separation to the star s rotational velocity .",
    "the spectral resolution of our observations is not sufficient to show the expected double peak structure of the lines .",
    "previous spectra of higher resolution ( 0.8   dispersion , 1.6   resolution ) indicate that the peak separation remains fairly constant and that it was @xmath3462 km  s@xmath4 in 1991 august 28 ( unger 1993 ) .",
    "the unresolved spectra are consistent with either this or a narrower value .",
    "the hei emission is clearly seen at @xmath17 6678   and @xmath17 7065   on 1991 october 16 and 27 .",
    "hence the line at @xmath17 7281   is probably hei and not an artifact introduced by the removal of the variable telluric h@xmath23o absorption band .",
    "generally , be stars with earlier spectral type have stronger emission in paschen lines ( andrillat et al .",
    "we observe p19p11 in emission on 1991 october 16 and 20 , and weaker emission from p18p11 on 1991 october 27 .",
    "the emission lines disappear , with p13 , p12 and p11 in absorption on 1992 february 19 .",
    "we hoped to be able to constrain the electron density in the disk by investigating the relative paschen line strengths .",
    "the line fluxes were dereddened using a standard galactic law , @xmath24 ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ; howarth 1983 ) and assuming @xmath10 for v635 cas ( hutchings & crampton 1981 ) .",
    "it is difficult to fix the continuum level between the various paschen lines due to the broad emission wings and blending with other lines ( see table 1 ) .",
    "line ratios were calculated for the unblended lines ( i.e. p19 , p17 , p14 , p12 , p11 ) .",
    "we estimate that the errors in the line fluxes are @xmath330% .",
    "these ratios were compared with case b optically thin recombination line strengths for a _ t@xmath25 _",
    "= @xmath26 k , _ n@xmath25 _",
    "= @xmath27 @xmath28 and _ t@xmath25 _ = @xmath26 k , _",
    "n@xmath25 _ = @xmath29 @xmath28 plasma ( hummer & storey 1987 ; storey & hummer 1995 ) .",
    "the line ratios were also compared with the optically thick line ratios based on the simple assumption that the disk is a _ t _ = @xmath30 k blackbody with the same line widths and emitting areas for all the observed paschen lines .",
    "general results for be star systems indicate that p@xmath2 and p@xmath21 line ratios are well away from the case b values ( sellgren & smith 1992 ) and that p19 and higher paschen lines are consistent with optically thin emission ( briot 1981 ) .",
    "however , these data have a turnover in the relative line strengths at both p17 and p11 .",
    "for example on 1991 october 16 the relative line fluxes for p17 , p14 , p12 , p11 , normalised to p17 are 1.0:2.4:1.9:1.5 .",
    "this means that we can not constrain the disk density . for optically thin emission",
    "we would expect that the relative line strengths increase as you descend the paschen series , the opposite is true for optically thick emission from a blackbody . to constrain these models",
    "we require observations of additional lines in the series and at a higher resolution so that the lines are not blended .",
    "the oi @xmath17  8446   emission is more frequent in early type stars ( andrillat et al . 1990 ) and if seen is always present in emission ( andrillat 1986 ) .",
    "this line is blended with p18 and we would expect it to be in emission when the oi @xmath17 7772 - 74 - 75 lines are in emission .",
    "the oi @xmath17 8446   line has a greater tendency to go into emission than the o i @xmath17 7772 - 74 - 75   line due to bowen fluorescence ( bowen 1947 ) .",
    "assuming the lines are optically thin and adopting the p19 equivalent width for p18 , which would under estimate the strength of p18 , we obtain equivalent widths of -1.2   and -2.0   for oi @xmath17 8446   on 1991 october 16 and 20 , respectively .",
    "the measured equivalent widths of of oi @xmath17 7772 - 74 - 75",
    "  on 1991 october 16 and 20 are -0.5   and -1.6  , respectively .",
    "we may have underestimated the strength of the oi @xmath17 8446   line but our values are well below the observed ratio of @xmath34 which has been reported for these lines in other be stars ( jaschek et al 1993 ) .",
    "there are two absorption lines present in all the spectra at @xmath17 7665 and @xmath17 7699   which could be ki lines .",
    "these lines have low excitation potentials of 1.6 ev but more importantly the ionization potential of potassium is 4.3 ev , so any emission must be shielded from the strong uv flux , i.e the line is probably formed in the outer regions of the disk . alternatively the ki lines could be due to interstellar absorption .",
    "there are two possible feii emission lines at @xmath36480   and 6508  .",
    "the feii has a low excitation potential , @xmath345ev , and we may expect the line to be formed in the outer disk if we assume the excitation potential is correlated with the disk size as in the balmer series .",
    "however , the feii line can be subject to ly@xmath1 fluorescence and hence we could also see it in the inner parts of the disk ( slettebak et al 1992 ) .",
    "higher resolution spectra to determine the positions of all of these lines and the individual peak separations are needed .    the emission line at @xmath17 7235   is present in all the 1991 october spectra .",
    "assuming it is not an artefact due to the removal of the telluric h@xmath23o absorption band we tentatively identify it as cii @xmath17 7234  .",
    "this line is excitable by resonance fluorescence from the uv continuum and we would expect the line to be formed near the star ( williams & ferguson 1983 ) .",
    "there are possibly some ni @xmath5 8629 , 8680 - 83 - 86 , 8703 - 12 - 19   emission lines .",
    "if neutral nitrogen is seen it is always in emission and it is more frequent in early type spectral classes ( jaschek et al 1992 ; andrillat et al 1990 ) .    finally there is a possible emission feature at @xmath17 8810   on 1991 october 27 .",
    "higher resolution spectra are needed to confirm the presence of these lines .",
    "v635 cas is now classified as an o9e star .",
    "we have demonstrated that a true spectral classification , although difficult to obtain , is needed to accurately model the bexrbs .",
    "the filling in of critical lines by the disk emission precludes a determination of the luminosity class .",
    "we hope that future observations during a disk - loss event will improve on this result .",
    "the far red spectra are an ideal probe of the circumstellar disk .",
    "higher resolution spectra including additional lines in the paschen series would enable us to confirm various line blends / strengths and measure the peak separation between the wings in the individual lines .",
    "this would enable us to model the size , density and velocity distribution in the disk .",
    "in particular the line profiles would help us parameterize the tidal effects of the neutron star at periastron .",
    "clearly this is a complex system as demonstrated by the dramatic spectral and photometric changes that occur on a short timescale of months .",
    "a precise determination of the spectral class , luminosity and @xmath31 requires frequent high resolution simultaneous multi - wavelength observations in order to catch the system in a disk - less state . in particular infrared observations of the hi lines",
    "are needed to further constrain the disk models .",
    "we thank the support astronomers at the william herschel telescope ( wht ) for our service mode observations .",
