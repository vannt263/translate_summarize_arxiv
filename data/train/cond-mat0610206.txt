    "the overall strength of the epi is summed up in a parameter @xmath0 .",
    "lead is a good example for a metal with strong epi having a @xmath0 value of @xmath1 . as a consequence",
    "the electron density of states at the fermi energy is enhanced by the factor @xmath2 .",
    "in addition the fermi velocity @xmath3 is reduced by the factor @xmath4 corresponding to an enhancement @xmath4 of the mass .",
    "( therefore this effect is often called `` mass enhancement '' ) . since metals with strong epi are generally superconducting a number of superconducting properties",
    "are also enhanced , for example the upper critical field @xmath5 .",
    "although there have been many experiments which investigated the properties of double and multi - layers of a metal s with strong epi and a metal w with weak epi , the author is not aware of any theoretical investigation of how the contact between s and w influences the mass enhancement in s or w. such an investigation is the goal of this paper .    in a metal with a strong electron - phonon interaction",
    "the fermi surface is not sharp even at zero temperature .",
    "this is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the occupation below the fermi momentum ( we discuss here the case of clean metals ) is less than one and above the fermi energy the occupation is not zero but finite . at the fermi energy",
    "the occupation drops by the value @xmath6 .",
    "the reason for this distribution is the following .",
    "an electron @xmath7 below the fermi energy can virtually emit a phonon @xmath8 and make a transition into a satellite state @xmath9 above the fermi energy .",
    "this process does not fulfill energy conservation since the satellite state @xmath10 has an excess energy of @xmath11 the satellite causes a finite electron occupation of the states @xmath9 above the fermi surface and a finite hole occupation of the states @xmath7 below the fermi surface .    in fig.1 an electron is introduced into a state @xmath12 directly above the fermi energy .",
    "it changes the occupation of the @xmath12-state only by @xmath13 because this state was already partially occupied , and after the introduction into the state @xmath12 part of the electron makes virtual transitions into the other states above the fermi energy .",
    "this reduces the occupation of the state @xmath12 .",
    "part of the electron is smeared over an energy range of @xmath14 in combination with single virtual phonons .",
    "therefore mass enhancement in an electron state @xmath12 above the fermi energy has two contributions :    * the pre - occupation of the state @xmath12 is larger than @xmath15 : the state @xmath12 is already partially occupied before an additional electron is introduced . *",
    "the post - occupation of the state @xmath12 is less than @xmath16 : after the introduction of an additional electron the state is not completely occupied because the electron makes virtual transitions into the other states above the fermi energy .",
    "both contributions are roughly equal .",

    "therefore the quasi - particle energies are closer together and their density of states is enhanced by the factor @xmath4 .    in appendix a1 a short review is given of the treatment of the electron - phonon mass enhancement with green functions .",
    "the discussed physical interpretation of the mass enhancement in terms of pre- and post - occupation is sketched .",
    "however , the green function method can not be easily expanded to multi - layers . therefore in this paper i use self - consistant perturbation theory .    in part",
    "ii the electron - phonon interaction and matrix element in multi - layers is derived . in part iii the amplitudes of the electron - phonon satellites are discussed . in a multi - layer",
    "these satellites interfere in real space .",
    "this is discussed in part iv . in appendix",
    "a2 the ground - state wave function in the presence of electron - phonon interaction is derived in self - consistent perturbation theory .",

    "i calculate the occupation of the electron states in real space in self - consistent ( brillouin - wigner ) perturbation theory .",
    "this yields an expression for the position and momentum dependent mass enhancement .",
    "a numerical evaluation is left to future work .",
    "abbreviations : epi = electron - phonon interaction , epme = electron - phonon matrix element .",
    "now the question is : what happens in a double layer ? does the finite occupation above the fermi energy leak from the strong - coupling metal into the weak - coupling metal ?",
    "if this is the case then one finds an enhanced density of states also in the normal metal ( because an additional electron above the fermi energy does not change the occupation by one ) . to analyze this question",
    "we investigate a very simple model of a double layer .",
    "* we consider a double layer of a strong - coupling metal s and a weak - coupling or normal metal w. to keep the analysis simple a primitive cubic lattice is used for both films with the same lattice constant @xmath20 .",

    "the metal s consists of @xmath21 layers and lies in the range @xmath22 @xmath23 and the metal w has @xmath24 layers in the regime @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the total number of layers in the z - direction . for normalization reasons the double film has a finite but large extension in the x- and y - direction with the lengths @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore we use periodic boundary conditions in all three dimensions .",
    "this represents a multi - layer of s and w. ( we expect that this is equivalent to an isolated double layer with half the thicknesses @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",

    "furthermore we assume that the elastic properties of both metals are identical .",

    "next we derive the electron - phonon matrix element ( epme ) @xmath44 for the transition of an electron from a state @xmath45 into @xmath46 by absorbing a phonon @xmath8 or emitting a phonon @xmath47 .",
    "the epme is derived in a number of textbooks @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the atoms have an ( somewhat artificial ) electron potential @xmath54 in the upper weak - coupling film for @xmath55 the atoms have zero electron potential . for zero displacement of the atoms the electron potential vanishes in both films .",

    "at @xmath78 in the absence of the electron - phonon interaction all states within the fermi sphere with @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is the fermi wave number ) are occupied and all other states are empty .",

    "one obtains for the amplitude of the satellites@xmath88 where @xmath89 is given in appendix a2 by the self - consistent equation ( [ eth ] ) .",

    "<S> a strong electron - phonon interaction in a metal increases the electron density of states in the vicinity of the fermi energy dramatically . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is called electron - phonon mass enhancement . in this paper the question is investigated whether the mass enhancement can be manipulated in multi - layers of two metals with strong and weak electron - phonon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> a rich behavior is observed for different thickness ranges of the layers . for thin layers </S>",
    "<S> one observes a rather homogeneous averaged enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> however , for an intermediate thickness range the mass enhancement is highly anisotropic , i.e. direction dependent , as well as position dependent . for large layer </S>",
    "<S> thicknesses one obtains the bulk behavior for each metal .    </S>",
