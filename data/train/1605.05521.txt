    "an important topic in the study of the dynamics of 1dimensional lattices ( or chains ) of nonlinearly interacting particles is their ability to support under rather general conditions a very interesting type of localized oscillations called discrete breathers ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chpt .  7 ) , @xcite ) .",
    "these solutions simply execute periodic motion and involve one or more central particles that carry most of the energy , while all others in their immediate vicinity have amplitudes that vanish exponentially as the index of the particle @xmath4 goes to @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "take for example the so  called klein - gordon system of ordinary differential equations written in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 for @xmath9 is the amplitude of the @xmath4-th particle , @xmath10 is a parameter indicating the strength of coupling between nearest neighbors , and @xmath11 is the on - site potential with primes denoting differentiation with respect to the argument of @xmath11 .    to construct such a discrete breather solution one may insert a fourier series @xmath12 in the equations of motion ( [ eq4 ] ) , where @xmath13 is the frequency of the breather . setting the terms proportional to the same exponential equal to zero",
    "one obtains the system of equations @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "this equation defines an infinite - dimensional mapping in the space of fourier coefficients @xmath16 .",
    "time - periodicity is ensured by the fourier basis functions @xmath17 , while spatial localization requires that @xmath18 exponentially as @xmath19 .",
    "if we want to construct a breather solution one can start from its lowest order approximation by substituting @xmath20 in ( [ infdimmap ] ) and obtain a 2dimensional map for the largest coefficient @xmath21 as follows @xmath22 which may be written in the form @xmath23 if we now define @xmath24 and @xmath25 the mapping takes the 2dimensional ( 2d ) form    [ 2dimxnynmap ] @xmath26    where @xmath27 .",
    "this mapping is area - preserving ( and also symplectic ) since the determinant of its jacobian is unity for all @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the above approach has proved quite useful in the past and has led to a wide variety of interesting results concerning the computation and dynamics of breathers and multibreathers in a large family of 1dimensional hamiltonian lattices @xcite . to our knowledge , such a study has not yet been carried out for coupled hamiltonian chains of this type .",
    "recently , contopoulos and co - workers have used normal form series expansions due to moser to represent invariant manifolds of saddle points and evaluate analytically homoclinic orbits of 2d maps and two  degree of freedom hamiltonian systems of physical interest .",
    "these series have generally limited convergence regions , which the authors need to extend using laborious analytical continuation techniques to obtain homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits as far away from the saddle points as possible to obtain meaningful conclusions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it appears quite cumbersome to extend these methods to 4d maps or 3degree of freedom hamiltonians .",
    "returning to our approach , let us observe that breather solutions of the original chain ( [ eq4 ] ) by definition must have large values of @xmath30 for small @xmath31 , while @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "this implies that these amplitudes can be identified as homoclinic orbits lying at the intersections of stable and unstable manifolds of the origin , which if hyperbolic is necessarily a saddle point of the map ( [ 2dimxnynmap ] ) . for any homoclinic intersection point ,",
    "its orbit under forward ( backward ) iteration along the stable ( unstable ) manifold asymptotically converges to the origin .",
    "thus the requirement that @xmath32 as @xmath33 is fulfilled at the outset . to locate such homoclinic orbits accurately , therefore",
    ", one must be able to write down precise expressions for the curves representing these manifolds and compute their points of intersection .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to derive such expressions for the stable and unstable manifolds and determine their intersections not only for a 2d but also a 4d map that represents an extension of ( [ 2dimxnynmap ] ) and can be applied to locate breathers in two linearly coupled particle chains of the form ( [ eq4 ] ) . to this end , we first introduce in section [ hyperbolicity ] the mapping of interest and prove its hyperbolic behavior for the symplectic case . in section [ parametrization ]",
    "we explain the idea of the parametrization method and how we use it to obtain a power series for the manifold equations . in section [ homoclinicity ]",
    "we solve these equations numerically and obtain the homoclinic intersections for a cubic map of the form ( [ 2dimxnynmap ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ 4-d case ] , we apply our approach to a 4d map with cubic nonlinearities and compute manifold intersections for various parameter values , commenting also on the accuracy limitations encountered by our numerical algorithms in this process .",
    "we close with our concluding remarks in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "nearly 45 years ago the french astronomer michel hnon introduced a 2d mapping of the plane onto itself with the simple form @xcite @xmath34 which exhibits very interesting phenomena related to chaos , like bifurcations and strange attractors for different values of its parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , the occurrence of some of its most important properties have been related to the transition from simple dynamics to hyperbolicity ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that there are dense sets of chaotic orbits lying at the intersections of invariant manifolds of unstable ( saddle ) fixed points and periodic orbits @xcite .    nowadays , however , it is more common to consider instead of ( [ h2dmap ] ) its conjugate expression @xmath37 which is more convenient to generalize both in its form as well as number of dimensions , as described for example in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , let us consider the family of generalized hnon maps of the plane onto itself defined by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a univariate polynomial .",
    "this class is of particular importance as any polynomial mapping of the plane having a polynomial inverse ( i.e. any member of the 2d affine cremona group ) is either a composition of mappings of the form ( [ gh2map ] ) , or possesses trivial dynamics @xcite .",
    "the main properties of the generalized hnon family ( [ gh2map ] ) are the following : first , the inverse of @xmath40 is explicitly given as @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , if the polynomial @xmath39 is odd , the mapping @xmath40 is symmetric under the transformation @xmath42 , which implies @xmath43 . for @xmath44",
    "the mapping @xmath40 is a symplectomorphism ( or symplectic map ) , as it preserves the natural symplectic form of the plane , @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , @xmath46 is also differentially conjugate to its inverse , since , if we define @xmath47 , it follows that @xmath48 holds . as a consequence , in the symplectic case , invariant sets of @xmath40 are related to invariant sets of @xmath49 by the transformation @xmath50 .",
    "generalized hnon maps have attracted a lot of attention in the literature .",
    "for example , in @xcite the dynamics of @xmath40 is studied , where @xmath39 is a polynomial of third degree , while in @xcite bifurcations of homoclinic tangencies are considered , involving intersections of invariant manifolds , for a mapping that has many similarities with ( [ gh2map ] ) above .",
    "furthermore , we note that in @xcite sufficient conditions are given for hyperbolicity in generalized hnon maps for arbitrary polynomials @xmath39 .    in the present work we study a class of maps ( [ gh2map ] ) that corresponds to the choice of a cubic polynomial @xmath39 and",
    "generalize our results to the case of 4d maps , as discussed in section [ introduction ] in connection with applications to discrete breathers in systems of 1dimensional hamiltonian particle chains @xcite .",
    "+      let us focus now on the dynamics of the recurrence relation : @xmath51 which is related to ( [ 2dimanmap ] ) by a simple rescaling of the fourier coefficients , while a parameter @xmath52 has been introduced to account for dissipation effects .",
    "setting @xmath53 , we define the following cubic map of the plane @xmath54 onto itself @xmath55 which corresponds to the generalized hnon map for @xmath56 .",
    "its inverse is given by @xmath57 for @xmath58 the mapping @xmath59 is a symplectomorphism and is invariant under the symmetry @xmath60 , i.e.the relation @xmath61 holds .",
    "the generalized hnon map is known to have rich dynamics .",
    "in fact , in @xcite the existence of hyperbolic sets for such maps has been proven for a wide range of parameter values .",
    "let @xmath62 be a diffeomorphism and @xmath63 a compact subset of @xmath64 , invariant under this diffeomorphism .",
    "@xmath63 is said to be a hyperbolic set for @xmath65 if @xmath66 the following is true :    1 .",
    "@xmath67 , 2 .",
    "@xmath68 , 3 .",
    "@xmath69 , for @xmath70 .",
    "these conditions imply that the tangent space of @xmath64 at every point of @xmath63 is the direct sum of two subspaces @xmath71 and @xmath72 which are invariant under the action of the differential of @xmath65 .",
    "moreover on these subspaces the differential acts as a contraction and dilation , respectively .    in",
    "what follows we will be interested in the diffeomorphism @xmath59 defined by equation   for the particular choice of @xmath73 which yields a saddle point at the origin and will be kept fixed in the remainder of this paper .",
    "this choice is pictorially convenient , since @xmath74 values in that range produce large scale manifolds that are clearly visible in the figures .",
    "let us now demonstrate under these conditions the existence of a hyperbolic set for this system :    let @xmath59 be the diffeomorphism  , with @xmath73 and @xmath44 .",
    "then , there exists a hyperbolic set @xmath63 on which @xmath59 is topologically conjugate to the two  sided shift on three symbols .",
    "moreover , @xmath75 consists of all those points whose orbits are bounded under successive iterations of  .",
    "the proof utilizes theorem 3.3 of @xcite .",
    "however , since it is not directly applicable to @xmath59 , we first perform a coordinate change by defining @xmath76 as @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "then , @xmath59 is left ",
    "right equivalent to @xmath79 , defined by @xmath80 , that is , @xmath81 .",
    "note that this is nothing more than a coordinate transformation of both the domain of definition and the image of @xmath59 , so , qualitatively , the behavior of @xmath59 remains unchanged .",
    "let us now set @xmath82 in this example .",
    "following the notation used in @xcite , we notice that @xmath83 is of the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , with @xmath86 .",
    "determining the roots of @xmath87 as @xmath88 , we consider the intervals @xmath89 .",
    "having thus chosen the neighborhoods of the map that are of interest , it is easy to verify that all conditions required for the application of theorem 3.3 in @xcite are satisfied , therefore the proposition holds .",
    "( a ) the square @xmath90\\times [ -1/2,1/2]$ ] .",
    "( b ) the area within the three vertical strips represents all points in the set @xmath91 generated after one forward iteration of all points of @xmath92 .",
    "( c ) the points of @xmath92 that are still inside @xmath92 after one forward and one backward iteration of the map lie in the intersection of the vertical strips of ( b ) and the horizontal strips shown here .",
    "this set , @xmath93 , represents the first step in the construction of the hyperbolic set of @xmath83 .",
    "]    figure [ threesymbols ] shows the first few steps of the construction of the hyperbolic set for the above map @xmath83 .",
    "hyperbolic sets persist for small perturbations of the mapping , thus we expect to find hyperbolic behavior for @xmath59 for other values of @xmath94 as well . in the next sections we show that the hyperbolic set established by the above proposition owes its existence to a transverse homoclinic point of @xmath59 .",
    "then we shall follow the intersections of the invariant manifolds of @xmath59 emanating from the origin to locate the critical value @xmath95 at which these manifolds are tangent to each other .",
    "this means that for @xmath96 homoclinic orbits no longer exist and the chaotic behavior of the map about the origin disappears @xcite . to determine the invariant manifolds and compute their intersections ,",
    "we make use of the so  called parametrization method , which we now briefly outline .",
    "let @xmath97 denote a @xmath98 diffeomorphism , having a hyperbolic fixed point at @xmath99 .",
    "assume that @xmath100 is the eigenspace of @xmath101 , corresponding to eigenvalues that have norm less than one .",
    "the stable manifold theorem @xcite asserts that the stable set of @xmath102 , @xmath103 , is a smooth immersed submanifold of @xmath104 , tangent to @xmath100 at @xmath102 ( an analogous statement holds for the unstable manifold of @xmath102 ) .    knowing how these two manifolds evolve as curves in the 2d phase space of the map offers crucial insight in the dynamics of the diffeomorphism @xmath59 .",
    "consequently , a number of methods have been developed to compute and visualize these manifolds ( see @xcite for a survey of these methods and @xcite for the 2d case ) .",
    "here we shall demonstrate how to compute stable ( and unstable ) invariant manifolds using the parametrization method .",
    "this method offers a simple and straightforward procedure for computing invariant manifolds of vector fields and diffeomorphisms as explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "in fact , its applications go far beyond the topics we examine in this paper ( see @xcite and references therein , for applications in a wide variety of problems ) .",
    "the parametrization method builds on the following fact : under the assumptions imposed on the diffeomorphism @xmath59 , there exists a @xmath105 injective immersion @xmath106 , such that : + ( a ) @xmath107 , + ( b ) the derivative of @xmath108 at @xmath102 is the inclusion map @xmath109 , and + ( c ) @xmath110 , where @xmath111 stands for the restriction of @xmath112 to @xmath100 . + this version of the stable manifold theorem may be found in @xcite , and the immersion @xmath108 is to be thought of as the parametrization of @xmath113 , considered as a submanifold of @xmath104 .",
    "central to the implementation of the parametrization method is the equation @xmath114 which from now on shall be called the _ defining equation _ of the stable manifold . here",
    "@xmath59 stands for the diffeomorphism of interest , while @xmath111 represents its linear part determined by the stable eigenvalues of the fixed point .",
    "@xmath108 denotes the parametrization of the invariant manifold that we wish to compute .    to proceed with this computation",
    ", we first need to expand the map @xmath108 as a power series . inserting this power series into the defining equation",
    ", we shall arrive at relations giving the coefficients of terms of degree @xmath4 as a function of coefficients of terms of lower degree .",
    "what is especially convenient here is the fact that these relations are linear and are thus easily solved , provided all coefficients of lower order terms are given .",
    "making use of the facts ( a ) and ( b ) above , one immediately finds that the constant terms of the power series are none other than the coordinates of the fixed point @xmath102 , while the coefficients of the linear terms are given by the eigenvectors of the stable eigenvalues .",
    "thus , solving a set of linear equations as explained above , we may compute one by one the coefficients of our power series up to arbitrary ( but finite ) order .",
    "this series does indeed converge under mild assumptions on @xmath59 , as explained in detail in @xcite .    in a completely analogous way the unstable manifold of @xmath102",
    "can also be computed . to accomplish this one simply has to replace @xmath111 in the defining equation by @xmath115 , that is , the restriction of @xmath112 onto the unstable subspace @xmath116 of @xmath102 . from here on , the procedure explained above is employed in precisely the same way to provide us with a parametrizion of the unstable manifold of @xmath102 .",
    "let us now apply this technique to construct the invariant manifolds of the cubic 2d diffeomorphism of interest here .",
    "returning to the cubic mapping given in equation  , let us note that it possesses three fixed points : the first one is the origin and exists for all parameter values , while there are also two symmetric ones , with coordinates @xmath117 . focusing at the @xmath118 fixed point , we first determine the eigenvalues of the linearized map @xmath119 and proceed to study its invariant manifolds , beginning with the @xmath44 case and continuing with @xmath120 , where @xmath59 becomes dissipative .",
    "our purpose is to locate the homoclinic points which are part of the hyperbolic set of @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , it suffices to locate the primary one at which the manifolds first meet , since it `` generates '' , under repeated application of @xmath59 and @xmath121 , all other points of the associated homoclinic orbit .",
    "@xcite let @xmath122 , and denote by @xmath123 $ ] the segment of @xmath124 with endpoints @xmath118 and @xmath102 and by @xmath125 $ ] the segment of @xmath126 with endpoints @xmath118 and @xmath102 .",
    "the point @xmath102 is called a primary ( homoclinic ) intersection ( point ) if @xmath123 $ ] intersects @xmath125 $ ] only at the points @xmath102 and @xmath118 .    as before , to fix ideas we set @xmath127 and proceed in what follows with the computation of the primary intersection points for @xmath59 , using the parametrization method .",
    "since @xmath127 and @xmath58 , the eigenvalues of the origin are @xmath128 and @xmath129 with normalized eigenvectors @xmath130 and @xmath131 . the origin is therefore a saddle , with a 1dimensional stable and a 1dimensional unstable manifold , which we now proceed to determine .",
    "let @xmath132 be the parametrization of the unstable manifold emanating from the origin expressed by the expansion @xmath133 the defining equation of this manifold becomes @xmath134 so that in the case of our 2d map we obtain @xmath135 this gives , after equating terms of the same power of @xmath136 , the following system    [ eq : equation - system-2d ] @xmath137    where @xmath138 is defined by @xmath139 the above is a linear system of equations for the coefficients @xmath140 of the power series , whose zero - th order terms ( @xmath141 ) are both zero since they represent the coordinates of the fixed point at the origin .",
    "the first order terms ( @xmath142 ) on the other hand are simply the coordinates of the unstable eigenvector .",
    "thus , we are now ready to compute the constants @xmath140 for every , finite , value of @xmath143 .    to perform the numerical computation of @xmath144",
    "we first truncate the series up to a polynomial @xmath145 of degree @xmath146 which is evaluated using horner s method .",
    "still this polynomial will only be a good approximation of the unstable manifold for a restricted range of values of @xmath136 .",
    "the range of validity can be quantified as follows :    [ def : epsilon - radius ] let @xmath147 .",
    "define @xmath148 to be an @xmath149-radius of validity of the polynomial approximation @xmath145 of @xmath144 if @xmath150 } \\arrowvert    \\arrowvert f\\circ { p^{\\text{u}}}(t)-{p^{\\text{u}}}(\\lambda t)\\arrowvert \\arrowvert < \\varepsilon$ ] .",
    "plot of the error @xmath151 for different degrees @xmath146 of the polynomial for @xmath152 .",
    "this shows that with 100 coefficients and @xmath136 up to 1.5 the error is below @xmath153 . ]    using this prescription , we shall keep terms up order @xmath154 of our series , for which we numerically obtain that @xmath155 provides an @xmath149-radius of validity , when we choose @xmath156 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilon - radius ] . for @xmath157",
    "the error strongly increases . as also shown in this figure ,",
    "increasing the order to @xmath158 and then @xmath159 we can go as far as @xmath160 for @xmath161 , which turns out to be sufficient for accurately locating the primary ( and all subsequent ) homoclinic intersections , as explained below .",
    "note , that in the definition of the error determining the @xmath149-radius of validity , the difference between points at @xmath162 is considered .",
    "thus , for practical purposes we may assume that the parametrization method provides satisfactory results up to @xmath163 .    to obtain an equally good polynomial approximation @xmath164 for the stable manifold @xmath165 of the origin ,",
    "we repeat the above steps , replacing @xmath166 with the stable eigenvalue @xmath167 in equation  , and proceed to solve for the coefficients of the parametrization of the manifold .",
    "first , we replace the coefficients of the first order terms with the coordinates of the stable eigenvector .",
    "actually , in the @xmath168 case one may exploit the fact that @xmath59 is differentially conjugate to its inverse under @xmath169 , and obtain its stable manifold as the image of its unstable manifold under @xmath50 .",
    "this symmetry is directly reflected in the coefficients of the polynomials of the parametrization method :    [ lemma : symm - coeffs ] let @xmath170 be a parametrization of the unstable manifold at the origin of symplectomorphism f above .",
    "then , a parametrization of the stable manifold of @xmath59 at the origin is @xmath171 .",
    "following from the system of equations   with @xmath58 and @xmath172 , the coefficients @xmath173 of @xmath145 satisfy the following system of equations @xmath174 @xmath175 let us now suppose that @xmath176 represents the parametrization of the stable manifold of the origin .",
    "note that , since @xmath59 is a symplectomorphism , the stable eigenvalue @xmath167 equals @xmath177 .",
    "clearly , the coefficients @xmath178 satisfy the following system : @xmath179 @xmath180    we claim that @xmath181 .",
    "indeed it follows from ( [ mancon2 ] ) that : @xmath182 which is equivalent with ( [ mancon1 ] ) , while from ( [ mancon21 ] ) we get    @xmath183    leading us back to ( [ mancon11 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath184 and @xmath185 as claimed .",
    "so , either by solving the defining equation , or making use of [ lemma : symm - coeffs ] , we arrive at a polynomial @xmath186 of degree @xmath154 , which is a satisfactory approximation of the stable manifold @xmath164 , in the sense of [ def : epsilon - radius ] and with the same radius of validity .    now ,",
    "since the polynomial curve @xmath187 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}^2 $ ] provides a good approximation of the local unstable manifold of the origin , we may iterate it using the mapping @xmath59 to produce an approximation of the unstable manifold .",
    "the same holds for @xmath186 , from which the corresponding stable manifold @xmath188 can be obtained by iteratively applying @xmath121 .",
    "( a ) stable ( blue ) and unstable ( red ) manifolds computed using the parametrization method for @xmath58 .",
    "the inset shows a magnification around the primary homoclinic intersection at @xmath189 which is indicated by a cross .",
    "( b ) regular orbits around the periodic points of period 2 and several irregular orbits escaping via the homoclinic tangle . ]",
    "figure [ 2dintersectiond1](a ) shows the stable and unstable manifolds of the origin for @xmath58 . to obtain this plot ,",
    "the parametrization method was used up to @xmath190 with @xmath191 .",
    "for example , for the unstable manifold , the segment obtained for @xmath192 $ ] is iterated up to @xmath193 times using @xmath59 and then the corresponding segment of the stable manifold was obtained by symmetry .",
    "note that , as the fixed point is inverse hyperbolic , one obtains alternatingly segments lying in the second and fourth quadrant .",
    "since a homoclinic point of transverse intersection between the stable and unstable manifolds exists , the birkhoff - smale theorem can be invoked to quarantee the existence of an infinity of transverse intersections , a phenomenon known as homoclinic chaos @xcite .",
    "this explains the scattered points shown in the phase space of the mapping at @xmath58 , plotted in fig .  [ 2dintersectiond1](b ) , where several orbits started in the region close to the hyperbolic fixed point at the origin eventually escape to infinity after a few iterations via the homoclinic tangle .",
    "some elliptic periodic orbits as well as tori encircling the stable period 2 points in the 2nd and 4th quadrant are also shown .",
    "we now wish to compute an approximation of the homoclinic intersection , i.e.  the point @xmath194 at which @xmath124 and @xmath126 intersect transversely .",
    "this means , that there are natural numbers @xmath195 , along with @xmath196 such that @xmath197 .",
    "furthermore , since the intersection is transversal , the vectors @xmath198 and @xmath199 are independent .",
    "furthermore we require that @xmath200 as @xmath201 .",
    "to evaluate such homoclinic points , we define the map @xmath202 , as @xmath203 and search for its zeroes .",
    "one solution , of course , is the point @xmath204 corresponding to the origin .",
    "non  trivial roots @xmath205 of this map for @xmath206 correspond to transverse homoclinic points of the mapping @xmath59 .",
    "validated computations can now be used to analytically prove the existence of such solutions for fixed parameter values , as described in @xcite . here however , we are more interested in accurately obtaining these solutions , while permitting the parameters to vary , until they no longer exist .",
    "we therefore proceed as described below .    to determine the non  trivial roots of @xmath207 it turns out to be particularly convenient to use polynomials of degree @xmath159 as , under these circumstances",
    ", the range for @xmath208 can be extended to @xmath209 $ ] while the manifolds are still computed with sufficient accuracy .",
    "thus , we do not have to worry about the possibility of non - intersecting segments , noting also that segments of each manifold get mapped to the other quadrant across @xmath118 due to the inverse hyperbolicity of the fixed point .",
    "for @xmath152 for example , we obtain a zero of @xmath210 for @xmath211 for @xmath212 , with the corresponding homoclinic point located at @xmath213 . the fact that both @xmath214 and @xmath215 within our numerical accuracy is already a good test of the quality of the numerically determined homoclinic point , particularly because the symmetry of the mapping for @xmath152 has not been used in the computations .",
    "our purpose now is to follow the evolution of these manifolds , for decreasing values of @xmath94 , until their curves in the @xmath54 phase plane no longer intersect .",
    "plot of the distance @xmath216 of the iterates @xmath217 from the origin .",
    "note that the iterates of our computed homoclinic point @xmath194 pass by the origin but stay away from it by an amount that provides a measure of the inaccuracy of the calculation .",
    "( a ) @xmath152 and ( b ) @xmath218 . ]    to test the accuracy of our computed homoclinic intersection @xmath219 we determine the distance @xmath216 of @xmath220 from the origin for both positive and negative @xmath4 . for positive",
    "@xmath4 the iterates of the homoclinic point approach the origin along the stable manifold @xmath221 , while , for negative @xmath4 the approach is along the unstable manifold @xmath221 .",
    "any inaccuracy of the determined homoclinic intersection point ( including additional round - off errors when applying @xmath222 ) implies that @xmath216 eventually will increase again .",
    "this means that the inaccurate orbit will depart again from the origin along @xmath188 for positive @xmath4 and along @xmath221 for negative @xmath4 .",
    "the smallest distance to the origin thus gives a measure of the inaccuracy of the numerically determined homoclinic intersections , see figure  [ fig : homoclinic - points - accurarcy-2d](a ) for @xmath152 and ( b ) for @xmath223 .",
    "let us now follow the primary homoclinic intersection of the two manifolds as we decrease @xmath94 .",
    "numerically we find a solution of @xmath225 as long as @xmath226 $ ] with @xmath227 , meaning that below this @xmath228 homoclinic orbits no longer exist . indeed ,",
    "for @xmath96 we do not obtain zeroes with the required accuracy ( which is @xmath229 for the purposes of this paper ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : homoclinic - points - accurarcy-2d](b ) shows for @xmath230 the corresponding distances @xmath216 demonstrating that the numerically determined homoclinic intersection is of comparable accuracy to the case @xmath152 .    for the above mentioned value of @xmath230",

    "we wish to find out how computationally demanding is this task , and compare the results with analogous findings in the 2dimensional case .",
    "to investigate breather interactions in two linearly coupled chains of 1dimensional hamiltonian systems , the approach discussed in the introduction leads to the identification of homoclinic orbits of a 4d map of the form :    @xmath233    where @xmath234 and @xmath235 are the leading terms of the fourier coefficients corresponding to the discrete breathers in the first and second chain respectively . setting @xmath236",

    "thus , we choose parameter values for which the origin of the above 4d map possesses a 2dimensional stable manifold , and a 2dimensional unstable manifold , corresponding to pairs of real eigenvalues with @xmath241 and @xmath242 respectively .",

    "cumbersome as they may seem , these equations are again linear with respect to the unknown @xmath256 , and may be solved immediately provided the terms of lower degree are known .",
    "the above equations will be crucially used in what follows to locate homoclinic points of the 4d map @xmath59 .      to study the 4d map we shall start from the uncoupled case @xmath257 , and",

    "we began with a 2d map , which belongs to the generalized hnon family , and computed its invariant manifolds using convergent series expansions derived by the parametrization method .",
    "we used parameter values at which tranversal intersections of the invariant manifolds of a saddle point at the origin are expected to occur , and followed these intersections until they disappeared by homoclinic tangency .",
    "thus , we were able to verify independently the validity of these results by direct iteration , showing that at the identified parameters the points we were following cease to converge to the origin .",
    "we then turned our attention to a 4d map , obtained from two coupled 2d maps of the previous form , resulting from two linearly coupled 1dimensional hamiltonian particle chains .",
    "once again we used the parametrization method to solve a system of linear equations and obtain the invariant manifolds of the saddle at the origin . using continuation methods",
    ", we showed that despite the more complicated calculations , homoclinic orbits can also be located without great difficulty and with comparable accuracy as in the 2d map case .",
    "the validity of out findings was checked again by finding parameter values at which homoclinic orbits disappear through a tangency of the corresponding manifolds .",
    "we emphasize that analytical expressions for invariant manifolds of saddle points can also be obtained by other methods through moser normal form series expansions .",
    "such methods , however , have limited convergence and extensive analytical continuation techniques are needed to extend their range of validity . on the other hand , the parametrization method is convergent and only requires the solution of linear systems for the coefficients of the first 30 - 50 terms to yield satisfactory results .    regarding potential applications of our techniques , we mention that it would be very interesting to use them to approximate discrete breathers in coupled 1dimensional hamiltonian lattices , for which to our knowledge not many results are available . furthermore , the potential use of this approach to problems described by vector fields ( and even p.d.e.s ) is worth exploring , in view of the effectiveness of the parametrization method in locating special solutions .    nevertheless , high dimensional maps are interesting by themselves as they are known to arise in various physical applications like e.g.  in the case of colliding particle beams of high energy accelerators , where the corresponding equations often appear in polynomial form ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
