    "non - orthogonal multiple access ( noma ) is envisaged as a potentially promising technique to address some key challenges in the fifth generation ( 5 g ) networks , such as high spectral efficiency and massive connectivity  @xcite .",
    "different from the traditional orthogonal multiple access ( oma ) techniques , e.g. , time - division multiple access ( tdma ) , that rely on the time , frequency , or code domain , noma explores the power domain for multiple access by combining superposition coding ( sc ) at the transmitter and successive interference cancellation ( sic ) at the receivers .",
    "the performance of noma in the network with randomly deployed users was analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "the design problem of the noma scheme from a fairness standpoint was addressed in  @xcite .",
    "cooperative noma schemes were investigated in @xcite and @xcite to improve the system reliability . to provide additional spatial degrees of freedom , multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) techniques",
    "were introduced to noma systems in @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the hybrid multiple access system combining noma and traditional oma by the technique of user pairing was studied in  @xcite .    with ubiquitous wireless devices adopted in everyday life ,",
    "an unprecedented amount of private and sensitive data is transmitted over wireless channels .",
    "consequently , the secrecy issues associated with wireless networks have become critical due to the unalterable open nature of wireless medium .",
    "physical layer security has been widely regarded as a promising complement to the cryptographic techniques to secure the data transmission over wireless channels  @xcite . in the seminal work",
    "@xcite , wyner introduced the wiretap channel as a framework for physical layer security , where a transmitter wants to send confidential messages to a legitimate receiver in the presence of an external eavesdropper .",
    "following wyner s wiretap channel , the wireless physical layer security against external eavesdroppers has been extensively studied in recent years , e.g. , @xcite from an information - theoretic perspective on the performance analysis and @xcite from a signal - processing perspective on the system design .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there is another research direction on physical layer security , which does not focus on the secrecy issue against external eavesdroppers . instead",
    ", confidential messages to the intended users are required to remain ignorance at other users in the same network , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "although a great amount of research effort has been paid to physical layer security in wireless communications , the secrecy issue of noma has been rarely considered in the literature , except for recent studies  @xcite .",
    "the secrecy issues of noma against external eavesdroppers were studied in  @xcite and @xcite , where the messages sent to all users by noma are required to be secure against the external eavesdropper .",
    "considering large - scale networks , the secrecy performance of noma with randomly deployed users and eavesdroppers were analyzed in  @xcite by using stochastic geometry  @xcite .",
    "focusing on the design of noma scheme , the problem of maximizing the secrecy sum rate at all users subject to a qualify of service ( qos ) constraint of the codeword rate at each user was tackled in  @xcite .",
    "note that the secrecy rate / capacity considered in  @xcite is achievable only when the transmitter has the perfect knowledge on the eavesdropper s instantaneous channel information , which is difficult to realize in practice .",
    "in addition , the qos constraint of the codeword rate can not guarantee the rate of informative data received by the user , although it simplifies the design problem . instead of considering the external eavesdropper ,",
    "@xcite investigated the noma system where the transmitter wants to send the confidential message to only one user and keep it ignorance at all other users . in this work",
    ", we study the design of noma schemes against the external eavesdropper .",
    "the practical scenario is considered such that the transmitter does not know the eavesdropper s instantaneous channel information . in this scenario ,",
    "the perfect secrecy rate / capacity is not achievable .",
    "therefore , we adopt the secrecy outage probability as the secrecy metric  @xcite .",
    "the primary contributions of the paper are summarized as follows .",
    "* we comprehensively investigate the design of noma against the external eavesdropper under the secrecy outage constraint .",
    "the decoding order , transmission rates , and power allocated to each user are all considered as designable parameters . for the first time ,",
    "we analytically prove that the optimal decoding order for the noma scheme with the secrecy outage constraint is the same to that for the conventional noma scheme without the secrecy constraint , i.e. , the descending order of channel gains normalized by noise @xcite .",
    "* we derive the closed - form solution to the problem of minimizing the transmit power subject to the secrecy outage constraint and a qos constraint .",
    "different from @xcite , the qos performance is characterized by the confidential information rate at each user , which captures the real rate of informative data received at the user .",
    "the problem is non - convex . unlike many conventional design problems of noma , e.g. ,  @xcite",
    ", our problem can not be transformed into a sequence of liner programs ( lps ) due to the secrecy outage constraint , and hence , it is more difficult to solve .",
    "* we further solve the problem of maximizing the minimum confidential information rate among users subject to the secrecy outage constraint and an instantaneous transmit power constraint . here , we regard the minimum confidential information rate among users as a fairness performance of noma with the secrecy consideration , which has never been investigated in the literature .",
    "we propose an iterative algorithm to solve the problem , and obtain the closed - form solution to the problem for the special case of two users .",
    "we find that one should increase the ratio of power allocated to the user who has a relatively bad channel when the secrecy constraint becomes more stringent . *",
    "both analytically and numerically , we compare the performance of the noma scheme with that of the oma scheme in the studied problems with the secrecy outage constraint .",
    "we analytically prove that the noma scheme always outperforms the oma scheme , and numerically show that the performance gain of the noma scheme over the oma scheme increases almost linearly as the number of users increases .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : sysmod ] presents the system model .",
    "sections  [ sec : mimpsum ] and  [ sec : maxfairnessrate ] study the problem of minimizing the transmit power subject to the secrecy outage and qos constraints and the problem of maximizing the minimum confidential information rate subject to the secrecy outage and transmit power constraints , respectively . the analytical comparison between noma and oma in the studied problems",
    "is conducted in section  [ sec : analyticalcomp ] .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section  [ sec : numericalresults ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclus ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a communication system where a transmitter wants to send confidential messages to @xmath0 users in the presence of an eavesdropper .",
    "the transmitter , the users , and the eavesdropper each have a single antenna . for the sake of brevity",
    ", we denote the @xmath1-th user as user @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "the channel coefficients from the transmitter to user @xmath1 and the eavesdropper are denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . both path loss and fading effects",
    "are considered , such that @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the path - loss exponent , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the distances from the transmitter to user @xmath1 and the eavesdropper , respectively , and @xmath10 denote the normalized rayleigh fading channel states . the quasi - static block fading model is adopted  @xcite , such that the channel coefficients remain constant during the transmission of one message , which consists of a block of symbols , and change independently from one block to the next .",
    "we assume that all channels are independent of each other . without loss of generality ,",
    "the channels gains are sorted as @xmath11 .",
    "we further assume that the transmitter knows the instantaneous channel gain of all users , i.e. , @xmath12 , but only knows the average channel gain of the eavesdropper over different fading realizations , i.e , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the expectation operation .",
    "note that @xmath15 can be obtained at the transmitter from the knowledge of the distance between the transmitter and the eavesdropper . here , we emphasize that the transmitter does not have the instantaneous knowledge on the eavesdropper s channel .",
    "we note that the assumption of knowing the statistics of the eavesdropper s channel has been widely adopted in the existing studies on wireless physical layer security ; see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the noma scheme enables the transmitter to simultaneously serve multiple users  @xcite .",
    "the transmitter uses the sc to send a linear combination of multiple signals to the users .",
    "the transmitted signal is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the transmit power allocated to user @xmath1 and @xmath18 denotes the normalized message for user @xmath1 .",
    "the instantaneous total transmit power is @xmath19 .",
    "the received signal at user @xmath1 and the eavesdropper are given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the zero - mean additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) at user @xmath1 with variance @xmath24 and the zero - mean awgn at the eavesdropper with variance @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the noise variances at all users are identical , i.e. , @xmath26 . as per the mechanism of noma",
    ", the users adopt the sic to decode the signals with the same decoding order  @xcite .",
    "denote the user index of the @xmath1-th user to decode as @xmath27 .",
    "the user @xmath27 first decodes the message for all users @xmath28 , @xmath29 , to remove the inter - user interference in a successive way .",
    "then , user @xmath27 decodes its own message while treating the messages for all users @xmath30 , @xmath31 , as the interference .",
    "the received signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratios ( sinrs ) at user @xmath27 , @xmath32 , and user @xmath33 to decode their own messages are given by @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , where @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , the received sinr at user @xmath37 to decode the message @xmath38 , @xmath39 , is given by @xmath40 similarly , the received sinrs at the eavesdropper of the message @xmath18 , @xmath32 , and the message @xmath41 are given by  @xcite @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively , where @xmath44 .",
    "note that the expressions for the received sinrs at the eavesdropper , i.e. , and , overestimate the eavesdropper s capability .",
    "a worst - case assumption from the legitimate users perspective is made here . in this assumption ,",
    "the messages for all users @xmath45 , @xmath29 , have already been decoded before the eavesdropper attempts to decode the message for user @xmath46 .",
    "we highlight that worst - case assumptions have been widely adopted in analyzing and designing transmission schemes with secrecy considerations , e.g. , @xcite , due to its alignment with the conservativeness mandated by the security studies .",
    "it is noticeable that the decoding order directly affects the performance of the noma scheme .",
    "although it has been clearly discussed that the capacity - achieving decoding order for conventional noma schemes without the secrecy consideration is in the descending order of channel gains normalized by noise @xcite , i.e. , @xmath47 , to the best of the authors knowledge , the optimal decoding order for noma schemes with the secrecy consideration has never been analyzed or discussed in the existing literature .",
    "we consider the widely - adopted wiretap code @xcite to secure the transmission of messages .",
    "there are two rate parameters for the message to each user @xmath1 , namely , the codeword transmission rate , @xmath48 , and the confidential information rate , @xmath49 .",
    "the positive rate difference @xmath50 is the rate cost to provide secrecy against the eavesdropper .",
    "a length @xmath51 wiretap code is constructed by generating @xmath52 codewords @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 . for each message index @xmath56 ,",
    "we randomly select @xmath57 from @xmath58 with uniform probability and transmit the codeword @xmath53 .",
    "we consider the adaptive - rate transmission , where the rate parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be adaptively chosen according to the instantaneous channel state information ( csi ) of the users . since the quasi - static fading channel is considered and the eavesdropper s instantaneous csi is unknown at the transmitter , perfect secrecy is not achievable .",
    "the secrecy outage probability is adopted to measure the secrecy performance of the transmission  @xcite .",
    "the secrecy outage probability of the message @xmath38 is given by  @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the probability measure and @xmath61 denotes the eavesdropper s channel capacity to decode the message @xmath38 .",
    "in this section , we design the noma scheme that minimizes the total transmit power subject to the qos constraint and the secrecy constraint .",
    "the qos performance of the noma transmission with wiretap encoding is characterized by the confidential information rate for each user @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in  @xcite the qos performance is captured by the codeword transmission rate for each user @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath48 , which is different from our work .",
    "we highlight that the adopted confidential information rate in this work is more suitable than the codeword transmission rate to capture the qos performance for the transmission with the wiretap code .",
    "this is because that the actual rate of the informative data is the confidential information rate , while the codeword transmission rate is the total rate of the informative data and the redundancy to provide secrecy .",
    "for example , a user who is served by a high codeword transmission rate with a low confidential information rate actually obtains the useful information slowly , which can not be considered as a good quality of service .",
    "the problem is formulated as follows :    [ prob : minsump ] @xmath62    where @xmath63 $ ] denotes the decoding order vector , @xmath64 $ ] denotes the power allocation vector , @xmath65 $ ] denotes the codeword transmission rate vector , @xmath66 $ ] denotes the confidential information rate vector , @xmath67 denotes the channel capacity of user @xmath46 to decode its own message , @xmath68 denotes the channel capacity of user @xmath37 to decode the message @xmath38 , @xmath69 denotes the minimum acceptable confidential information rate for each user , and @xmath70 denotes the maximum tolerable secrecy outage probability for each message . in the formulated problem  ,",
    "the constraint is to ensure that @xmath38 can be decoded by user @xmath46 without error , and the constraint is to ensure that @xmath38 can be decoded by user @xmath37 , @xmath71 , for the sic .",
    "in addition , the qos constraint is represented by  , which requires a minimum acceptable confidential information rate @xmath72 for each user .",
    "the secrecy constraint is represented by  , which requires a maximum tolerable secrecy outage probability @xmath73 for each message .",
    "we assume that all users have the same qos requirement @xmath69 and the same secrecy outage requirement @xmath73 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our analysis can be extended to the general scenario where each user have a different qos requirement @xmath74 and a different secrecy outage requirement @xmath75 , which however is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "note that the problem is not always feasible depending on the channel conditions of the users and the eavesdropper . in this section ,",
    "we assume that the problem is feasible .",
    "the condition for the problem to be feasible will be given later in corollary [ coro:1 ] .",
    "one can find that the optimal @xmath76 is the maximum @xmath76 that satisfies and .",
    "then , based on and , the optimal @xmath76 to the problem for any given decoding order @xmath77 and power allocation @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "one can also find that the optimal @xmath81 is the minimum @xmath81 that satisfies  , since the minimum power consumption is a non - decreasing function of the confidential information rate .",
    "then , the optimal solution of @xmath82 to the problem is given by @xmath83 with and , the secrecy outage probability is derived as  , shown at the top of the next page , where @xmath84 .",

    "[ prop : optdecodingpi ] , we note that the optimal decoding order for the studied noma scheme with the secrecy outage constraint is the same to that for the conventional noma scheme without the secrecy consideration .",
