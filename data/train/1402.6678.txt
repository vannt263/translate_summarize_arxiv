    "in the past few decades neutrino ",
    "photon reactions as well as their implications for astrophysics and cosmology have attracted some interest and a definite progress has been reached in this field  @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been realized that the inelastic process @xmath5 significantly dominates over elastic scattering @xmath6 @xcite . in its turn ,",
    "when the energy threshold of the electron ",
    "positron pair production is crossed , the reaction @xmath7 becomes the dominant one  @xcite .",
    "though neutrinos are generally considered to be weakly interacting particles , it has been shown that neutrino ",
    "photon interactions should not be confined only to discussions of loop effects in scattering , or generating neutrino magnetic moments  @xcite . in some cases @xmath8 reactions at tree level",
    "are competitive with the standard charged or neutral current neutrino scattering , and even may be dominant .",
    "an intuitive view of how a neutrino interacts with the photon is provided by the parton model  @xcite .    with the completion of the icecube kilometer - scale neutrino detector located at the south pole  @xcite , the idea of observing cosmic ultra - high energy ( uhe ) electron antineutrinos through the resonant @xmath9-channel reaction @xmath10  @xcite ( the so - called glashow resonance ) is again in the focus of attention of physicists  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there has already been a proposal to interpret the pev cascade events ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) recently reported by the icecube experiment  @xcite in terms of the glashow resonance  @xcite . however , the antineutrino energy in the laboratory reference frame required to excite this resonance is @xmath14 pev ( 1  pev=@xmath15  ev ) , so that the gaps in energy between the observed events and the expected resonance position are of the order of a few pev . it should be noticed that according to  @xcite , the icecube event reconstructed energy is not due to the resonance at 6.3 pev at 68% c.l ..    usually in the analysis of uhe neutrino interactions , under the glashow resonance the following reaction at @xmath16 is implied :    @xmath17    though it would also be fair to refer to the remainder five similar processes predicted by the standard electroweak theory ,    @xmath18    as to the glashow resonances ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we do so in the subsequent discussion and call any of the reactions  ( 1)(2 ) the glashow resonance .",
    "the reason for highlighting  ( 1 ) and ignoring  ( 2 ) in the literature is simply that electrons as targets are explicitly present in matter while positrons , muons and tau leptons are not .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to remind us that one can attribute an equivalent lepton spectrum to the photon as well as to charged particles  @xcite .",
    "neutrinos may excite the glashow resonances on such equivalent leptons generated by atomic nuclei  @xcite , so that the corresponding probabilities should be studied in detail .",
    "we also emphasize that so far none of the glashow resonances has been revealed and their experimental observation would undoubtedly be a crucial test of the standard electroweak theory .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the reactions    @xmath20    near the threshold @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "( our conclusions are exactly the same for the cp conjugate reactions @xmath21@xmath22 since the equivalent lepton spectrum of the photon is cp - symmetric , but for the sake of definiteness we restrict attention to ( 3 ) ) .",
    "we compare two independent calculations of the corresponding cross sections : 1 ) direct calculations using the standard electroweak lagrangian  @xcite ; 2 ) calculations in the framework of the equivalent particle approximation .",
    "we show that the standard electroweak theory strongly suggests that the reactions ( 3 ) proceed via the glashow resonances .",
    "accordingly , we put forward a hypothesis that _ the on - shell @xmath2 bosons in the reactions @xmath3@xmath4 are the glashow resonances_.    if the hypothesis is true , then the mentioned reactions provide an opportunity to observe the glashow resonances for all neutrino flavors at laboratory energies far below 6.3  pev . for example",
    ", we have found that in the reactions @xmath23@xmath24 , relevant for the icecube experiment , the glashow resonances can appear already at neutrino energies about 20  tev .",
    "a role of these reactions for testing t  symmetry at the icecube neutrino observatory is discussed .",
    "we show that a model of t - violating glashow resonance production by neutrinos interacting with the equivalent photons of the @xmath25o nuclei is able to describe the tev - pev neutrino events recently observed by the icecube collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections of the reactions  ( [ introd_3 ] ) can be straightforwardly calculated using the standard electroweak lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "the two diagrams that contribute to the amplitude at leading order are depicted in fig .",
    "[ sm_result ] .",
    "the result reads    @xmath26,\\label{tree}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the fermi constant , and @xmath30 is the fine structure constant .",
    "figure  [ cross_sm ] shows the cross sections for the three different neutrino flavors .",
    "one may notice the sharp rise of the cross sections at @xmath31 ( especially for @xmath32 ) and the subsequent slow falling with energy .",
    "this is typical for processes in which the so - called initial state radiation takes place .",
    "it is well known that emission of real or virtual photons from the initial colliding electrons essentially modify the shapes of the narrow resonance curves  @xcite : the curves become wider , a suppression of the resonance maximum is observed and the main distinctive feature  _ the radiation tail _  appears to the right of the resonance pole .",
    "the matter is that even if the collision energy @xmath33 exceeds the mass of the resonance @xmath34 , the radiated photon carries away the energy excess @xmath35 before @xmath36 annihilation and thus turns back the @xmath36 pair to the resonance energy .",
    "analogously , it is tempting to identify the shapes of the cross sections in fig .",
    "[ cross_sm ] with the radiation tails arising due to initial state emission of charged leptons from the photon ( initial state lepton - strahlung ) . in order to do this",
    ", we have to assume the following mechanism for the reactions  ( [ introd_3 ] ) schematically illustrated in fig  [ s_chan ] : the initial photon splits into a @xmath37 pair and subsequently the positively charged lepton from this pair annihilates with the ingoing neutrino into @xmath38 ( the glashow resonance ) , while the energy excess @xmath39 is carried away by the outgoing @xmath40 .",
    "in addition to the peculiarities of the behavior of the cross sections near and above the threshold , there is also another argument strongly suggesting the initial state lepton - strahlung mechanism for @xmath41 .",
    "let us plot the qed structure functions of the photon , @xmath42 , in a graph with flipped abscissa ( recall that @xmath43 gives the probability density of finding a charged lepton in the photon with fraction @xmath44 of the parent photon s momentum ) .",
    "when looking at such a graph shown in fig .",
    "[ struc_fun ] , one immediately recognizes the similarity to the shapes of cross sections from fig  [ s_chan ] . it should be emphasized that the structure functions are obtained independently for deep inelastic charged lepton ",
    "photon scattering  @xcite .",
    "an explanation for this similarity is that the relatively narrow glashow resonances project out the structure functions of the photon @xmath42 in the cross sections @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "formally this is well seen by exploiting the parton model approach which tells us that @xmath45 can be written as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 are the cross sections of the subprocesses @xmath48 , the integration is performed over the kinematically allowed values of @xmath44 . in the narrow width approximation @xmath47 can be replaced by a dirac @xmath49  function , so that @xmath50 . substituting the latter into  ( [ eq_main_convol ] ) yields    @xmath51    thus",
    ", one can conclude from  ( [ eq_narrow2 ] ) that our mechanism accounts for the similarity between @xmath45 and @xmath42 : they turn out to be proportional to each other .",

    "let us utilize the cross sections for the subprocesses @xmath48 in the breit  wigner form making the description of the resonances more physically realistic than the narrow width approximation . in this case , one has    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the width of the decay @xmath58",
    ", @xmath59  is the total decay width of @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "substituting  ( [ eq_narrow ] ) into  ( [ eq_convol ] ) , we have performed calculations and display the results in comparison with the direct standard electroweak theory predictions in figs .",
    "[ pm_el ] , [ pm_mu ] and [ pm_tau ] .",
    "one can see that our model is again in a very good quantitative agreement with the straightforward standard calculations  @xcite .",
    "the shifts of the reaction thresholds to energies slightly lower than @xmath1 are obviously due to the finite width effect  @xcite : the w propagator adopted in  @xcite has the structure @xmath62 , while we have used it in the general form @xmath63 . everywhere in the calculations we have taken @xmath64 , @xmath65 @xmath66 , @xmath67 gev , @xmath68 gev , @xmath69 gev , @xmath70 gev , @xmath71 gev , @xmath72 gev .",
    "the glashow resonances can be produced in neutrino ",
    "nucleus scattering @xmath73 . to find the corresponding cross sections one has to convolute  ( [ eq_convol ] ) with the equivalent photon spectrum of the nucleus :    @xmath74    where @xmath75",
    ", @xmath76 is the equivalent photon spectrum .",
    "the general expression for @xmath76 can be written as  @xcite    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the momentum transfer to the nucleus , @xmath79 is the charge of the nucleus , @xmath80 is the electromagnetic nuclear formfactor normalized to @xmath81 , @xmath82 with @xmath83 being the mass of the nucleus .",
    "let us consider the nucleus of oxygen @xmath84 as the target because ultra high energy neutrinos can be detected in large volumes of water or ice , for example , the icecube kilometer - scale detector  @xcite , the antares undersea neutrino telescope  @xcite as well as the next generation deep - water neutrino telescopes km3net",
    "@xcite and nt1000 on lake baikal  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ nucl_cross ] shows our calculations of the cross sections for the three neutrino flavors as functions of neutrino energy in the laboratory reference frame .",
    "the formfactor of @xmath84 was taken from  @xcite . at the same neutrino energy ,",
    "the contribution to the cross section from elastic neutrino  proton scattering will be much less than that from the coherent neutrino ",
    "nucleus interactions due to @xmath85 , where @xmath86 .",
    "figure  [ fig_ratio ] shows the ratio of the cross - sections per nucleon for @xmath23@xmath24 found in the previous section , to that for the charged current neutrino ",
    "nucleus scattering  @xcite as a function of neutrino energy in the laboratory reference frame .",
    "one can see that the neutrino detection rate due to the glashow resonance production is expected to increase by @xmath87 in the energy range from @xmath88 tev to several pev .",
    "this is about two times lower than the result of similar calculations performed in  @xcite , where the existence of this enhancement was pointed out for the first time .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to different treating the nuclear formfactor .",
    "it should be emphasized that the errors in calculating @xmath89 due to uncertainties on the parton distribution functions of the nucleon do not exceed 3% in the neutrino energy range considered  @xcite .",
    "one can also notice that the energy range is essentially overlapping with the energies of the tev ",
    "pev neutrino candidates recently announced by the icecube collaboration . in a three - year dataset the icecube observed 37 events with in - detector deposited energies between @xmath90  tev and 2 pev  @xcite .",
    "in the view of the overlap between our calculations and the icecube data we return to the formula  ( [ eq_convol ] ) and notice that by writing  ( [ eq_convol ] ) we have implicitly exploited the principle of detailed balance related to t symmetry .",
    "the matter is that we have taken    @xmath91    of course , the experimental value of the decay width @xmath57 is in agreement with the standard electroweak model  @xcite , however @xmath92 was never experimentally measured .",
    "therefore , if we are strict , the possibility that    @xmath93    should not be rejected at present .",
    "then , we have to multiply  ( [ eq_convol ] ) by the following correction factor :    @xmath94    which takes into account eventual t violation in the glashow resonances .",
    "the expected event rate distribution at icecube reads    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the number of target nuclei in the effective volume of the detector , @xmath97 is the time of exposure , @xmath98 is the solid angle , @xmath99 is the flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos of flavor @xmath100 . taking @xmath101 ( the number of the @xmath84 nuclei in the effective volume 0.44 km@xmath102 ) , @xmath103 days , assuming the 1:1:1 neutrino flavor ratio ( this is not inconsistent with the present icecube data though there are arguments against the equal flavor composition  @xcite ) , neglecting the upward going electron and muon neutrinos ( because they are very likely absorbed in the earth ) , adopting @xmath104 , @xmath105  @xcite , we have estimated the number of the glashow resonance events per year at icecube in the energy range from 15  tev to 2  pev :    @xmath106    thus , experimental investigations of the neutrino events in this energy range automatically probe t symmetry in glashow resonance production .",
    "it is interesting that our approach with t - violating glashow resonances is able to account for the tev - pev icecube events  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ events ] we show the event rate distribution at icecube according to  ( [ eq_distribe ] ) for the time of exposure equal to 662 days and @xmath107 .",
    "this gives 18 events in total in the range from 15  tev to 2  pev .",
    "since high - momentum transfer neutrino interactions with the equivalent photons is suppressed by the nuclear formfactor , almost all the incident neutrino momentum will be transferred to the w boson and either totally or by half ( depending on the w boson decay mode ) will be deposited in the detector .",
    "the ratio of the track events to the shower events in the detector is then obviously given by    @xmath108    where we take into account the subsequent decay of @xmath109 into a muon plus the corresponding ( anti)neutrinos whose branching fraction is about 0.18 .",
    "meanwhile , the icecube reports a two times higher value  @xcite :    @xmath110    nevertheless , one should keep in mind that the numerator of  ( [ icecube_ration ] ) includes the background muon tracks whose expected number is not less than 3  @xcite , so that the experimental ratio @xmath111 .",
    "we have analyzed the reactions @xmath112 near the threshold @xmath1 . we compare two independent calculations of the corresponding cross sections : 1 ) direct calculations using the standard electroweak lagrangian  @xcite ; 2 ) calculations in the framework of the equivalent particle approximation .",
    "we show that the standard electroweak theory strongly suggests that these reactions proceed via the glashow resonances . in more detail ,",
    "the analysis indicates the following mechanism for these reactions : the initial photon splits into a @xmath37 pair and subsequently the positively charged lepton from this pair annihilates with the ingoing neutrino into @xmath38 ( the glashow resonance ) , while the energy excess @xmath39 is carried away by the outgoing @xmath40 .",
    "it is essential that the leptons are radiated before the glashow resonance appears .",
    "we call this mechanism `` initial state lepton - strahlung '' .",
    "if the hypothesis is true , then the mentioned reactions provide an opportunity to observe the glashow resonances for all neutrino flavors at the laboratory energies far below 6.3  pev .",
    "for example , we have found that in the reactions @xmath23@xmath24 , relevant for the icecube experiment , the glashow resonances can appear already at neutrino energies about 20  tev .",
    "it turns out that the standard model predicts a somewhat enhancement of the glashow resonance event rate in ice in the energy region , where the icecube collaboration has detected 28 neutrino candidates   with energies from 30 tev to 1.2 pev@xcite , which is about two times higher than the signal expected from the atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we show that experimental investigations of the neutrino events in this energy range automatically probe t symmetry in glashow resonance production . relying on this observation",
    "we show that a model with t - violating glashow resonances produced by neutrinos interacting with the equivalent photons of the @xmath25o nuclei is able to account for the distribution of these neutrino events at icecube .",
    "we would also like to note that there are processes described by diagrams whose structures at tree level coincide with that for @xmath41 .",
    "for example , one encounters such diagrams in single scalar and vector leptoquark production in lepton  gluon scattering @xmath113  @xcite which also lead to the cross sections with the feature resembling the radiation tail .",
    "therefore , it is also fair to expect that they proceed , in analogy with the initial state lepton - strahlung , via an initial state quark - strahlung mechanism and the leptoquarks in these reactions are produced in @xmath9-channel subprocesses",
