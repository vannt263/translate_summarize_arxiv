    "after the discoveries of oscillations of atmospheric , solar and terrestrial neutrinos , one has gained a lot of valuable information regarding the mixing matrix and the squared mass differences .",
    "the absolute scale of the neutrino mass can not , however , be determined in such experiments .",
    "our best hope for settling this important issue as well as solving a second challenging problem , i.e. whether the neutrinos are majorana or dirac particles , is the observation of neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "the total lepton number violating neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0-decay ) , @xmath6 can take place only if the neutrino is a massive majorana particle @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath0-decay rate could , in principle , determine an absolute scale of neutrino mass , solve the neutrino mass hierarchy problem and provide information about the majorana cp - violating phases of neutrinos .",
    "the evidence for a @xmath0-decay of @xmath7 has been claimed by some authors of the heidelberg - moscow collaboration at laboratori nazionali del gran sasso @xcite with @xmath8 such a claim has raised some criticism but none of the existing experiments can rule it out @xcite . the only certain way to confirm or refute this claim is with additional sensitive experiments @xcite , in particular the gerda experiment @xcite , which plans to start taking data this year .",
    "there is a general consensus that the @xmath0-decay has to be observed at different isotopes .",
    "strong limits on the @xmath0-decay half - life have been achieved in nemo3 @xcite and cuoricino @xcite experiments : @xmath9 after neutrino oscillations established that the neutrinos are massive , non - degenerate and strongly admixed , naturally most people s attention has focused on the light neutrino mass mechanism of the @xmath0-decay .",
    "it is well known , however , that the @xmath0-decay can be triggered by a plethora of other lepton number violating ( lnv ) mechanisms . among these",
    "we should mention the exchange of heavy neutrinos , the exchange of susy superpartners with r - parity violating , leptoquarks , right - handed w - bosons or kaluza - klein excitations , among others , which have been discussed in the literature .",
    "so the day after the @xmath0-decay is observed and , hopefully , established in a number of nuclei , the main question will be what is the dominant mechanism that triggers the decays .",
    "possibilities to distinguish at least some of the possible mechanisms include the analysis of angular correlations between the emitted electrons @xcite , study of the branching ratios of @xmath0-decays to ground and excited states @xcite , a comparative study of the @xmath0-decay and neutrinoless electron capture with emission of positron ( @xmath10ec@xmath11 ) @xcite and analysis of possible connections with other lepton - flavor violating processes ( e.g. , @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "the main disadvantages of the above approaches are : small @xmath0-decay rates to excited states , suppressed @xmath13-decay rates , experimental challenges to observe the produced x - rays or auger electrons and the fact that most double @xmath5-decay experiments of the next generation are not sensitive to electron tracks .",
    "in this paper we shall analyze what happens , if several mechanisms are active for the @xmath0-decay .",
    "we will show that all lnv parameters , including the most interesting mass term , can be determined provided that @xmath0 data from traditional experiments involving a sufficient number of nuclear targets become available .",
    "the subject of interest is a coexistence of the following lnv mechanisms of the @xmath0-decay : i ) light neutrino mass mechanism .",
    "ii ) heavy neutrino mass mechanism .",
    "both mechanisms assume only left - hand current weak interactions .",
    "iii ) the trilinear r - parity breaking susy mechanism generated by gluino exchange . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we shall assume that the lepton violating parameters are relatively real as , e.g. , is the the situation in the case cp conservation .",
    "the inverse value of the @xmath0-decay half - life for a given isotope @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are , respectively , the lnv parameters and the nuclear matrix elements ( nmes ) , in the order given above .",
    "each of the nmes depends , in general , quite differently on the nuclear structure of the particular isotopes @xmath14 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 under study .",
    "@xmath20 is the known phase - space factor ( @xmath21 is the energy release ) , which include fourth power of axial - coupling constant @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath20 contain the inverse square of the nuclear radius @xmath23 , compensated by the factor @xmath24 in @xmath25 .",
    "the assumed value of the nuclear radius is @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "the phase - space factors are tabulated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the lepton number violating mechanisms of interest together with corresponding nuclear matrix elements are presented briefly below .",
    "in the case of light - neutrino mass mechanism of the @xmath0-decay we have @xmath28 under the assumption of the mixing of three light massive majorana neutrinos the effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath29 takes the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the first row of the neutrino mixing matrix and @xmath32 are unknown majorana cp phases .",
    "@xmath33 is the light neutrino mass ( @xmath34 ev , i=1 , 2 , 3 ) . in this case",
    "only left - handed weak interaction is taken into account .",
    "the nuclear matrix element @xmath35 consists of fermi , gamow - teller and tensor parts as @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is axial - vector coupling constant .",
    "the fermi , gamow - teller and tensor operators are defined in the usual way ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : spinstr ] ) below ) with exchange potentials as given elsewhere @xcite      we assume that the neutrino mass spectrum include heavy majorana states @xmath38 with masses @xmath39 much larger than the energy scale of the @xmath0-decay , @xmath40 gev . these heavy states can mediate this process as the previous light neutrino exchange mechanism .",
    "the difference is that the neutrino propagators in the present case can be contracted to points and , therefore , the corresponding effective transition operators are local unlike in the light neutrino exchange mechanism with long range internucleon interactions .",
    "the corresponding lnv parameter is given by @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the mass of proton .",
    "@xmath43 are elements of the neutrino mixing matrix associated with left - handed current interactions .",

    "one encounters lnv couplings which may also trigger the @xmath0 decay .",

    "we have four different sets of two linear equations : @xmath94 for the absolute value of the lnv parameters we find two different solutions , @xmath95 we note , however , that for @xmath96 eqs . ( [ mbb2e ] ) and ( [ eta2e ] ) are reduced to eq .",
    "( [ one.masseta ] ) .    by assuming now @xmath97",

    "the parameter @xmath91 represents the unknown half - life of the @xmath0-decay of @xmath2mo or @xmath3te .",
    "we note that for @xmath100 the solution for active only light neutrino mass mechanism given by eq .",
    "( [ one.masseta ] ) is reproduced and that @xmath101 means non - observation of the @xmath0-decay for a considered isotope .    by glancing the fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we see that for both combinations of nuclear systems the two solutions for @xmath4 exhibit similar behavior . for",

    "[ fig:1 ] it follows that a small improvement of the current half - life limit for @xmath3te up to value @xmath109 y ( @xmath110 ) would exclude these possibilities .",

    "[ fig:2 ] .",

    "the claim of evidence of the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1ge would be ruled out by other experiments , i.e. for larger value of @xmath98ge ) , they would decrease and might be important .",
    "it has been shown that the extraction of the most important neutrino mass contribution , entering neutrinoless double beta decay , can be disentangled from the other mechanisms , if and when the decay rates in a sufficient number of nuclear targets become available . in the present calculation , to simplify the exposition , we restricted ourselves in the special case of no right handed currents and made the assumption that the lnv parameters are relatively real . to be more specific , in addition to the standard light neutrino mass mechanism of the @xmath0-decay , we considered two additional lnv mechanisms , namely those involving the exchange of heavy neutrinos and r - parity breaking susy with gluino exchange .",
    "we find that this improved analysis leads to completely different results compared to those of one mechanism at a time .",
    "it is now possible that larger values of @xmath4 can be consistent with the data , since the contribution of the other mechanisms could be interfering with it destructively .",
    "we specifically discussed the extracted value of the effective majorana neutrino mass , @xmath82 , assuming the claim of evidence of the @xmath0-decay of @xmath1ge @xcite as a function of half - life data for the two promising nuclei , ( @xmath2mo and @xmath3te ) .",
    "we showed that in an analysis including two and three nuclear systems there are 2 and 4 different possible solutions for @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "one of the solutions leads to small values of @xmath4 , when all mechanisms add up coherently .",
    "this is compatible also with inverted ( @xmath107mev ) or normal ( @xmath108 few  mev ) hierarchy of neutrino masses .",
    "other solutions , however , allow quite large values of @xmath4 , even larger than 1 ev .",
    "these can , of course , be excluded by cosmology and tritium @xmath5-decay experiments .",
    "it may not , however , be possible to exclude these solutions , if the claim of evidence for @xmath1ge would be ruled out by future experiments , since , then , the values we obtain become smaller than those of the other experiments .",
    "it is thus important that experiments involving as many different targets as possible be pursued .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of interference between the various mechanisms , the availability of reliable nuclear matrix elements becomes more imperative .",
