    "quantum dots obtained by interrupted growth in strained semiconductor interfaces are currently under intense study by many experimental and theoretical groups .",
    "@xcite these ` self - assembled ' quantum dots are mostly dislocation free , coherent islands of deposited material on the surface of a different semiconductor .",
    "the lattice mismatch from one semiconductor to the other forces the segregation of material whenever the epitaxial growth exceeds a critical layer thickness , resulting in the growth of these so - called stranski - krastanov islands .",
    "@xcite deposition of material past a critical thickness , which depends on the two materials used , results in large arrays of small islands with a rather narrow size distribution ( with size variations well under 10% ) , and typically arranged randomly on the plane ( although avoiding overlapping islands , for the most part ) .",
    "@xcite more recently , some groups are working at producing in - plane ordering of islands following different approaches , including ` nucleation site engineering ' to favor certain locations for self - assembled dot growth .",
    "@xcite these self - assembled quantum dots have , for the most part , a large area - to - height aspect ratio . in the case of inas islands grown on a gaas surface ,",
    "the in - plane diameters are typically less than 30 nm , while their heights are below 10 nm .",
    "@xcite although not without some controversy , it is generally believed that the inas quantum dots on gaas are shaped like a ` lens ' , characterized by a spherical cap shape with circular cross section . upon optical or other mechanisms of carrier injection , both electrons or holes have bound well - confined states inside these dots .",
    "in fact , optical experiments on self - assembled dots demonstrate that these structures provide strong carrier confinement , as decreasing dot size produces strong blue - shift of the extremely - narrow luminescence peaks in _ isolated _ dots .",
    "@xcite confinement effects have also been shown to appear in magneto - capacitance and infrared absorption experiments by several groups .",
    "@xcite clear evidence of electronic shell states and their different degeneracies has been reported recently , @xcite and novel applications such as storage of photoluminescence signals was demonstrated recently in gate - activated ` optical memories . '",
    "@xcite    simplifying the symmetry of the lens as a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator has been suggested to characterize the level structure for charge carriers in the dots , and this has proven useful in the interpretation of experiments .",
    "@xcite nevertheless ,",
    "as we will show here , a lens geometry has quite a different level structure and wavefunctions with subtle symmetries which might be seen in experiments .",
    "for example , we find that as the height of the cap or lens decreases , there is a larger shift of the wavefunction towards the plane of the lens ( in comparison with the situation in a semi - spherical geometry ) .",
    "this shift becomes stronger for ` flatter ' lenses , and may even give rise to deconfinement of the state towards the substrate , for finite confinement potential , changing significantly the oscillator strength of electron - hole transitions , for example .",
    "@xcite however , even before that occurs , the smaller height lens geometries exhibit a different level structure than the harmonic oscillator , as we show below",
    ". this structure may give rise to different pauli blocking effects and transition rules , topics which are the subject of interest in recent experiments .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we rigorously show that a complete set of wavefunctions can be generated with the correct lens symmetry to describe the physical properties given by the differential equation of interest . for the sake of simplicity , we have applied our calculation here to the single - particle schrdinger equation .",
    "the incorporation of non - parabolic band dispersion or many - particle interactions is straightforward ( if only a bit cumbersome ) .",
    "notice that while our calculation provides an analytical approach to the understanding of electronic states in these structures , it also provides an interesting example of a generalization of perturbation theory for the conformally - mapped differential operator arising from the schrdinger equation in the material .",
    "since the conformal transformation used to map the lens into the semi - spherical geometry is non - trivial , the resulting differential equation in the transformed space reflects that complexity .",
    "fortunately , our perturbation approach is robust for the identified small parameter of the problem , as we will show .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows : in section ii we introduce the problem of the spherical cap geometry , its semi - spherical limit , and the conformal map which connects the two shapes . in that section , we also describe the perturbation approach needed to carry out the solution of the appropriately mapped schrdinger operator , and explore the orthonormalization conditions of the basis used in the description of the general problem . in section iii we present some examples of the eigenstates for varying lens size , and analyze their angular and radial distribution functions .",
    "section iv presents some discussions and conclusions , while the appendix contains details of the expansion described in section ii .",

    "the deviation observed when the ratio @xmath108 decreases is relatively small , in comparison with the semi - spherical cap .",
    "in contrast , the angular probability shows a rather strong deviation as a function of @xmath108 , as the maximum probability is shifted towards @xmath139 ; that is , the carrier is located more towards the plane @xmath140 , as the cap height decreases ( see fig .",
    "for all states , the maximum of @xmath128 is smoothly shifted towards @xmath141 , except for level @xmath136 .",
    "the different behavior observed for the radial and angular probability densities can be seen as arising from the fact that the geometry of the quantum dot is essentially decreasing in radius and not in angle , as @xmath108 decreases .",

    "a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for the perturbation theory to be valid is that @xmath147 must be less than the unity , and this criterion is fulfilled for the range @xmath148 @xmath72 .",
    "another more restrictive condition for the applicability of this method is that @xmath149 , saying that the differences between non - perturbed dimensionless energy states need to be larger than the matrix elements of the perturbation . a more complete , non - perturbation , solution of eq.([pp ] ) is needed to completely assess the validity of the perturbation approach .",
    "however , one can be confident that for small @xmath112 values , the eigenstates and eigenfunctions found represent an accurate solution to the problem , as the perturbation and the small parameter is well defined , and the procedure robust .",
    "we have presented a formal and systematic conformal analytical map model to describe quantum dots with lens geometry and circular cross section arising in the growth of low dimensional semiconductor systems .",
    "the reported transformation can be extended straightforward to different physical - mathematical models as electronic states and phonon modes fulfilling a certain differential equation .",
    "the proposed conformal image maps the lens boundary into a dot with semi - spherical shape , allowing one to obtain a complete set of orthonormal functions to characterize the physical problem keeping the full lens symmetry .",
    "we have applied the formalism to the eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the schrdinger problem in a spherical cap geometry .",
    "the conformal mapping of the equation allows a modified but well defined rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation approach , where the cap height to in - plane radius is used to define the small parameter of the theory .",
    "we find that the wavefunctions are strongly shifted towards the flat face , as the height of the lens decreases , while the radial dependence is not affected as much .",
    "this change in the wavefunctions is interesting on its own , as it reflects the changes produced by the appropriate operator after the conformal mapping .",
