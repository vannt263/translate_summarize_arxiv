    "denote by @xmath21 the class of functions of the form @xmath22 analytic in @xmath18 . the class of univalent functions in @xmath21 is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "two subclasses of @xmath23 to which we will make frequent reference are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the subclasses of starlike functions ( with respect to the origin ) and convex functions , respectively .",
    "recall that a function @xmath26 is characterized by the condition @xmath27 there are a number of ways the class @xmath24 has been generalized in the literature and one such generalization is defined as follows : for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , define @xmath28 the function @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 is in @xmath4 and acts the role of extremal function for the class @xmath4 .",

    "more often , the class @xmath4 is studied with the restriction @xmath48 ( see janowski @xcite ) so that the values of @xmath49 lie inside the disk in the right half plane with center @xmath50 and radius @xmath51 , and so , the class @xmath4 becomes a subclass of @xmath24 whenever @xmath48 .",
