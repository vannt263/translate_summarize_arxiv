    "tmt is a generally coordinate invariant theory where _ all the difference from the standard field theory in curved space - time consists only of the following three additional assumptions _ :",
    "the main supposition is that for describing the effective action for gravity @xmath9 matter at energies below the planck scale , the usual form of the action @xmath10 is not complete .",
    "our positive hypothesis is that the effective action has to be of the form@xcite @xmath11 including two lagrangian densities @xmath12 and @xmath13 and two measures of integration @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "one is the usual measure of integration @xmath14 in the 4-dimensional space - time manifold equipped with the metric @xmath16 .",
    "another is the new measure of integration @xmath15 in the same 4-dimensional space - time manifold .",
    "the measure @xmath15 being a scalar density and a total derivative may be defined by means of four scalar fields @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) : @xmath19    \\2 .",
    "it is assumed that the lagrangian densities @xmath12 and @xmath13 are functions of all matter fields , the dilaton field , the metric , the connection but not of the `` measure fields '' @xmath17 . in such a case ,",
    "i.e. when the measure fields enter in the theory only via the measure @xmath15 , the action ( [ s ] ) possesses an infinite dimensional symmetry@xcite ) .",
    "one can hope that this symmetry should prevent emergence of a measure fields dependence in @xmath12 and @xmath13 after quantum effects are taken into account .",
    "important feature of tmt that is responsible for many interesting and desirable results of the field theory models studied so far@xcite consists of the assumption that all fields , including also metric , connection and the _ measure fields _",
    "@xmath17 are independent dynamical variables .",
    "all the relations between them are results of equations of motion .",
    "in particular , the independence of the metric and the connection means that we proceed in the first order formalism and the relation between connection and metric is not necessarily according to riemannian geometry .",
    "we want to stress that except for the listed three assumptions we do not make any changes as compared with principles of the standard field theory in curved space - time . in other words , all the freedom in constructing different models in the framework of tmt consists of the choice of the concrete matter content and the lagrangians @xmath12 and @xmath13 that is quite similar to the standard field theory .",
    "variation of the measure fields @xmath17 results in the equation of the form @xmath20 where the matrix @xmath21 is non - degenerate if @xmath22 .",
    "then we get @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a constant of integration with the dimension of mass . in what follows",
    "we make the choice @xmath26 .    applying the palatini formalism in tmt one",
    "can show that in addition to the christoffel s connection coefficients , the resulting relation between connection and metric includes also the gradient of the ratio of the two measures @xmath27 which is a scalar field .",
    "consequently geometry of the space - time with the metric @xmath16 is non - riemannian .",
    "the gravity and matter field equations obtained by means of the first order formalism contain both @xmath28 and its gradient .",
    "it turns out that at least at the classical level , the measure fields @xmath17 affect the theory only through the scalar field @xmath28 .",
    "the consistency condition of equations of motion has the form of a constraint which determines @xmath29 as a function of matter fields . by an appropriate change of the dynamical variables which includes a transformation of the metric",
    ", one can formulate the theory in a riemannian space - time .",
    "the corresponding frame we call `` the einstein frame '' .",
    "the big advantage of tmt is that in the very wide class of models , _ the gravity and all matter fields equations of motion take canonical gr form in the einstein frame_. all the novelty of tmt in the einstein frame as compared with the standard gr is revealed only in an unusual structure of the scalar fields effective potential ( produced in the einstein frame ) , masses of fermions and their interactions with scalar fields as well as in the unusual structure of fermion contributions to the energy - momentum tensor : all these quantities appear to be @xmath28 dependent@xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is why the scalar field @xmath29 determined by the constraint as a function of matter fields , has a key role in the dynamics of tmt models .",
    "our tmt model includes gravity and a dilaton field @xmath0 . in the early universe @xmath0 plays the role of inflaton and in the late universe it is is a part of the dark energy .",
    "we postulate the global scale invariance : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and the lagrangian @xmath32 , @xmath33 in the action ( [ s ] ) are : @xmath34\\nonumber\\\\ l_2=e^{\\alpha\\phi /m_{p}}\\left[-\\frac{b_g}{\\kappa}r(\\gamma , g)+\\frac{b_{\\phi}}{2}g^{\\mu\\nu}\\phi_{,\\mu}\\phi_{,\\nu}-v_{2}e^{\\alpha\\phi /m_{p}}\\right ]   \\label{totaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one should point out that there are two types of the gravitational terms and of the `` kinetic - like terms '' which respect the scale invariance : the terms of the one type coupled to the measure @xmath15 and those of the other type coupled to the measure @xmath14 . using the freedom in normalization of the measure fields @xmath17 we set the coupling constant of the scalar curvature to the measure @xmath15 to be @xmath35 . normalizing all the fields such that their couplings to the measure @xmath15 have no additional factors , we are not able in general to provide the same in the terms describing the appropriate couplings to the measure @xmath14 . this fact explains the need to introduce the dimensionless real parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 and we will only assume that _ they are positive and have close orders of magnitudes_. note that in the case of the choice @xmath38 we would proceed with _ the fine tuned model_. the real positive parameter @xmath39 is assumed to be of the order of unity ; in all numerical solutions presented in this talk we set @xmath40 . for the newton constant we use @xmath41 ,",
    "note also the possibility of introducing two different pre - potentials which are exponential functions of the dilaton @xmath0 coupled to the measures @xmath15 and @xmath14 with factors @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "such @xmath0-dependence provides the scale symmetry ( [ st ] ) .",
    "however @xmath43 and @xmath44 might be higgs - dependent and then they play the role of the higgs pre - potentials@xcite .",
    "the common feature of all equations of motion in the original frame is that the measure @xmath15 degrees of freedom appear only through dependence upon the scalar field @xmath28 , eq.([zeta ] ) . in particular , all the equations of motion and the solution for the connection coefficients include terms proportional to @xmath45 , that makes space - time non riemannian and all equations of motion - noncanonical .",
    "it turns out that when working with the new metric @xmath46 which we call the einstein frame , the connection becomes riemannian . since @xmath47 is invariant under the scale transformations ( [ st ] ) , spontaneous breaking of the scale symmetry ( by means of eq.([varphi ] ) )",

    "this effect follows just from the fact that there are no reasons to choose the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath37 in the action ( [ totaction ] ) to be equal in general ; on the contrary , the choice @xmath70 would be a fine tuning .",
    "besides one should stress that the @xmath0 dependence in @xmath8 , @xmath71 and in equations of motion emerges only in the form @xmath72 where @xmath25 is the integration constant ( see eq.([varphi ] ) ) , i.e. due to the spontaneous breakdown of the scale symmetry ( [ st ] ) ( or the shift symmetry @xmath73 in the einstein frame ) .",
    "thus the above equations represent an _ explicit example of @xmath3-essence_@xcite _ resulting from first principles including the scale invariance_. the system of equations ( [ gef ] ) , ( [ rho1])-([phi1 ] ) can be obtained from the k - essence type effective action @xmath74 \\label{k - eff},\\ ] ] where the scalar field effective lagrangian @xmath75 , eq.([p1 ] ) , can be represented in the form @xmath76^{2 } } { 4[b_{g}\\left(v_{1}+m^{4}e^{-2\\alpha\\phi / m_{p}}\\right)-v_{2 } ] } \\label{eff - l - ala - mukhanov}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 depend on @xmath0 only via @xmath72 .",
    "note that the lagrangian ( [ eff - l - ala - mukhanov ] ) differs from that of ref.@xcite by the sign of @xmath78 : in our case @xmath79 provided the effective potential ( the last term in ( [ eff - l - ala - mukhanov ] ) ) is non - negative .",
    "_ this result can not be removed by a choice of the parameters _ of the underlying action ( [ totaction ] ) while in ref.@xcite the positivity of @xmath78 was an essential _ assumption_. this difference plays a crucial role in a number of specific features of the scalar field dynamics , e.g. _ the absence of the initial singularity of the curvature is directly related to the negative sign of _ @xmath78 .",
    "the cosmological dynamics is significantly simplified if @xmath80 .",
    "note that studying the cosmological constant ( cc ) problem we are in fact interested in a regime where @xmath81 .",
    "therefore in what it concerns the cc problem , the results of the fine tuned model ( @xmath80 is equivalent to @xmath70 ) coincide with those of the generic case @xmath82 .",
    "so let us consider a spatially flat frw cosmological model governed by eqs.([rho1])-([phi1 ] ) ( where we set @xmath80 ) and @xmath83 . in the fine tuned case under consideration , the constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) yields @xmath84 the energy density and pressure take then the canonical form , @xmath85 , @xmath86 where the effective potential of the scalar field @xmath0 results from eqs.([veff1 ] ) and ( [ zeta - without - ferm - delta=0 ] ) @xmath87^{2 } } { 4[b_{g}\\left(v_{1}+m^{4}e^{-2\\alpha\\phi / m_{p}}\\right)-v_{2 } ] } \\label{veffvac - delta=0}\\ ] ] and the @xmath0-equation ( [ phi1 ] ) is reduced to @xmath88 .",
    "notice that @xmath89 is non - negative for any @xmath0 provided @xmath90 that we will assume in what follows .",
    "we assume also that @xmath91 .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the effective potential ( [ veffvac - delta=0 ] ) is that it is proportional to the square of @xmath92 which is a straightforward consequence of our basic assumption that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are independent of the measure fields . due to this , as @xmath93 and @xmath94 , _ the effective potential has a minimum where it equals zero automatically _ , without any further tuning of the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this occurs in the process of evolution of the field @xmath0 at the value of @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "this means that the universe evolves into the state with zero cosmological constant without any additional tuning of the parameters and initial conditions .",
    "if such type of the structure for the scalar field potential in a conventional ( non tmt ) model would be chosen `` by hand '' it would be a sort of fine tuning .",
    "but in our tmt model it is not the starting point , _ it is rather a result _ obtained in the einstein frame of tmt models with spontaneously broken global scale symmetry including the shift symmetry @xmath97 .",
    "note that the assumption of scale invariance is not necessary for the effect of appearance of the perfect square in the effective potential in the einstein frame and therefore for the described mechanism of disappearance of the cosmological constant , see ref.@xcite . to provide the global scale invariance ( [ st ] ) , the prepotentials @xmath98 and @xmath99 enter in the action ( [ totaction ] ) with factor @xmath100 .",
    "however , if quantum effects ( considered in the original frame ) break the scale invariance of the action via modification of existing prepotentials or by means of generation of other prepotentials with arbitrary @xmath0 dependence ( and in particular a `` normal '' cosmological constant term @xmath101 ) , this can not change the result of tmt that the effective potential generated in the einstein frame is proportional to a perfect square .    at the first glance this effect",
    "contradicts the weinberg s no - go theorem@xcite which states that there can not exist a field theory model where the cosmological constant is zero without fine tuning .",
    "however one can show that conditions of the weinberg s theorem do not hold in our model .",
    "note that @xmath102 , eq.([zeta - without - ferm - delta=0 ] ) , becomes singular @xmath103 in this limit the effective potential ( [ veff1 ] ) ( or eq.([veffvac - delta=0 ] ) ) behaves as @xmath104 .",
    "thus , disappearance of the cosmological constant occurs in the regime where @xmath105 . in this limit ,",
    "the dynamical role of the terms of the lagrangian @xmath33 ( coupled with the measure @xmath14 ) in the action ( [ totaction ] ) becomes negligible in comparison with the terms of the lagrangian @xmath32 ( see also the general form of the action ( [ s ] ) ) .",
    "it is evident that * the limit of the tmt action ( [ s ] ) as @xmath106 is opposite to the conventional field theory ( with only measure @xmath14 ) limit of the tmt action*. from the point of view of tmt , this is * the answer to the question why the old cc problem can not be solved ( without fine tuning ) in theories with only the measure of integration * @xmath14 * in the action*.    recall that one of the basic assumptions of the weinberg s no - go theorem is that all fields in the vacuum must be constant .",
    "this is also assumed for the metric tensor , components of which in the vacuum must be * nonzero * constants . however , this is not the case in the underlying tmt action ( [ totaction ] ) defined in the original ( non einstein ) frame if we ask what is the metric tensor @xmath16 in the @xmath107 vacuum . to see this",
    "let us note that in the einstein frame all the terms in the cosmological equations are regular .",
    "this means that the metric tensor in the einstein frame @xmath47 is always well defined , including the @xmath107 vacuum state @xmath95 where @xmath28 is infinite .",
    "taking this into account and using the transformation to the einstein frame ( [ ct ] ) we see that * all components of the metric in the original frame @xmath16 go to zero overall in space - time as @xmath0 approaches the @xmath108 vacuum state * : @xmath109 this result shows that the weinberg s analysis based on the study of the trace of the energy - momentum tensor misses any sense in the case @xmath110 .",
    "it follows immediately from ( [ g - degen ] ) that @xmath14 tends to zero like @xmath111 as @xmath112",
    ". then the definition ( 5 ) implies that the integration measure @xmath15 also tends to zero but rather like @xmath113 as @xmath112 .",
    "thus both the measure @xmath15 and the measure @xmath14 become degenerate in the @xmath107 vacuum state @xmath95 . however @xmath14 tends to zero more rapidly than @xmath15 .",
    "as we have discussed in detail@xcite , with the original set of variables used in the underlying tmt action ( [ s ] ) , ( [ totaction ] ) it is very hard or may be even impossible to display the physical meaning of tmt models .",
    "one of the reasons is that in the framework of the postulated need to use the palatini formalism , the original metric @xmath16 and connection @xmath114 appearing in the underlying tmt action describe a non - riemannian space - time .",
    "the transformation to the einstein frame ( [ ct ] ) enables to see the physical meaning of tmt because the space - time becomes riemannian in the einstein frame .",
    "now we see that the transformation to the einstein frame ( [ ct ] ) plays also the role of a * regularization of the space - time metric * : the singular behavior of the transformation ( [ ct ] ) as @xmath115 compensates the disappearance of the original metric @xmath16 in the vacuum @xmath116 . as a result of this the metric in the einstein frame @xmath47 turns out to be well defined in all physical states including the @xmath107 vacuum state .",
    "let us start from the analysis of eq.([phi1 ] ) .",
    "the interesting feature of this equation is that each of the factors @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) can get to zero and this effect depends on the range of the parameter space chosen .",
    "[ fig9 ]    for @xmath119 , eq .",
    "( [ phi1 ] ) results in the well known equation@xcite @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the effective sound speed of perturbations @xmath122 @xmath8 and @xmath71 are defined by eqs.([rho1 ] ) , ( [ p1 ] ) and @xmath123 @xmath124 - by eqs.([q1])-([q3-rho - phi ] ) .",
    "it follows from the definitions of @xmath125 and @xmath126 that @xmath127 when @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( that implies @xmath130 ) .",
    "however @xmath131 when @xmath132 and @xmath133 .    in the model with @xmath134 and @xmath135 ,",
    "the structure of the phase plane is presented in the figure above for the following set of the parameters : @xmath40 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "with such a choice of the parameters the following condition is satisfied @xmath139 that determines the structure of the phase plane . by the two branches of the line @xmath140 ,",
    "the phase plane is divided into three large dynamically disconnected zones . in the most part of two of them ( ii and iii ) , the energy density is negative ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "in the couple of regions between the lines @xmath140 and @xmath142 , @xmath143 but @xmath132 .    the zone",
    "i of the phase plane ( where @xmath128 , @xmath143 and @xmath130 ) is of a great cosmological interest : all the phase curves start with very steep approach to an attractor and they arrive the attractor asymptotically .",
    "one can show that the attractor does not intersect the line @xmath140 .",
    "in the neighborhood of the line @xmath140 all the phase curves exhibit a _ repulsive _ behavior from this line . in other words , the shape of two branches of @xmath140",
    "do not allow a classical dynamical continuation of the phase curves to the past in time without crossing the classical barrier formed by the line @xmath140 .",
    "this is true for all finite values of the initial conditions @xmath144 ,",
    "@xmath145 in zone i. the cosmological evolution corresponding to the phase curves with @xmath146 is a power law inflation which ends with the graceful exit to a zero cc vacuum state without fine tuning ( point b in the figure marks the corresponding oscillatory regime ) .    in two regions between the lines @xmath140 and @xmath147 that we refer for short as ( @xmath148)-regions , , the squared sound speed of perturbations is negative , @xmath149 .",
    "this means that on the right hand side of the classical barrier @xmath140 , the model is absolutely unstable .",
    "moreover , this pure imaginary sound speed becomes infinite in the limit @xmath150 .",
    "thus the branches of the line @xmath140 divide zone i ( of the classical dynamics ) from the ( @xmath148)-regions where the physical significance of the model is unclear .",
    "note that the line @xmath142 divides the ( @xmath148)-regions into two subregions with opposite signs of the classical energy density .",
    "thus the structure of the phase plane yields a conclusion that the starting point of the classical history in the phase plane can be only in zone i and * the line @xmath151 is the limiting set of points where the classical history might begin*. for any finite initial values of @xmath144 and @xmath145 at the initial cosmic time @xmath152 , the duration @xmath153 of the continuation of the evolution into the past up to the moment @xmath154 when the phase trajectory arrives the line @xmath155 , is finite .",
    "note that @xmath156 , the energy density @xmath157 and the pressure @xmath158 are finite in all points of the line @xmath151 with finite @xmath159 .",
    "one can also show that the strong energy condition is satisfied in regions of zone i close to the line @xmath151 including the line itself .",
    "the detailed analysis yields the conclusion that the singularity as @xmath160 is a sort of sudden singularities studied by barrow@xcite on purely kinematic grounds : @xmath161 , the scalar curvature is finite but its time derivative @xmath162 .",
    "equations @xmath163 ( @xmath118 ) determine lines in the phase plane @xmath164 . in terms of a mechanical interpretation of eq.([phi1 ] ) , the change of the sign of @xmath165 can be treated as the change of the mass of `` the particle '' .",
    "therefore one can think of situation where `` the particle '' climbs up in the potential with acceleration .",
    "it turns out that when the scalar field is behaving in this way , the flat frw universe may undergo a super - acceleration .",
    "with simple algebra one can see that the following `` sign rule '' holds for the equation - of - state : @xmath166 . therefore if in the one side from the line @xmath167 @xmath168 then in the other side @xmath169 . to incorporate the region of the phase plane where @xmath169 into the cosmological dynamics one should provide that the line @xmath167 lies in a dynamically permitted zone . as we have seen in sec.4 , the condition ( [ cond - for - phase - structure ] ) disposes the line @xmath167 in the physically unacceptable region where @xmath170 .",

    "there are a lot of sets of parameters providing the @xmath169 phase in the late universe .",

    "note that the same mechanism of the sudden initial singularity we have discussed in sec.4 , holds also here for solutions whose phase curves are located in zone 1 .    in the region to the right of the line @xmath174 , all phase curves approach the attractor which in its turn asymptotically ( as @xmath178 ) takes the form of the straight line @xmath179 .",
