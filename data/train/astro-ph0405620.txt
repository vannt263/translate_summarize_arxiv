    "most cosmological observations provide compelling evidences that our universe is undergoing a late time acceleration phase  @xcite . however , there are still several debates about the physical interpretation of these observations . while it seems clear that the friedmann equations for a universe only composed of normal matter ( i.e. radiation and dust ) even including dark matter can not explain the current data , there are different ways of facing this fact . either one can conclude that the interpretation of the cosmological data are not correct ( i.e. we do not accept the evidence for the acceleration of the universe , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent critical review and e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) or one tries to introduce new degrees of freedom in the cosmological model . in this latter case",
    ", these extra degrees of freedom , often referred to as _ dark energy _",
    ", can be introduced as a new kind of matter or as a new property of gravity .    in the first approach",
    "one assumes that gravitation is described by general relativity while introducing new forms of gravitating components , beyond the standard model of particle physics , which must have some effective negative pressure to explain the acceleration of the universe .",
    "various candidates such as a cosmological constant , quintessence  @xcite with many potentials , k - essence  @xcite etc ... have been proposed .",
    "but , one is still left with the cosmological constant problem  @xcite ( why is the density of vacuum energy expected from particle physics so small ? ) as well as the time coincidence problem ( why does the dark energy starts dominating today ? ) unsolved . from a cosmological point of view",
    ", these models are characterized by their equation of state which can be reconstructed from the function @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the hubble constant at present and @xmath2 the scale factor , either using the observation of background quantities or the growth of cosmic structures  @xcite .",
    "the other route is to allow for modification of gravity .",
    "this means that the only long range force that can not be screened is assumed to be not described by general relativity .",
    "once such a possibility is considered , many classes of models exist  ( see e.g. ref .",
    "for instance , a light scalar field can couple to matter leading to models of extended quintessence  @xcite and more generally to scalar - tensor types of theories .",
    "such theories have some difficulties to explain the current cosmological observations  @xcite without a quintessence - like potential for the scalar field or a cosmological constant .",
    "this scalar field may also be at the origin of some variation of the fundamental constants , depending on its couplings , and violation of the universality of free fall ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "other possibilities include braneworld models in which the standard model fields are localized on a 3-dimensional brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime . among braneworld models ,",
    "a subclass of models have the property of allowing for deviation from 4-dimensional einstein gravity on large scales .",
    "this is for example the case of some multi - brane models  @xcite , multigravity  @xcite , brane induced gravity  @xcite or simulated gravity  @xcite . in such models",
    ", gravity is not mediated only by massless gravitons , one therefore expects to have deviations from newton inverse square law on large scales .",
    "testing the poisson equation on large scales may be a way to distinguish between these alternatives  @xcite .",
    "the different types of models are summarized schematically on fig .",
    "a diagnostic of the cause of the acceleration of the universe will require to make many tests .",
    "in particular , the reconstruction of the function @xmath3 ( or equivalently measuring the effective equation of state of the dark energy ) will not be sufficient to distinguish between many models .",
    "it is thus important to simultaneously check for the poisson equation , the growth of structure and the variation of the constants .    among these tests",
    "it has recently been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the reciprocity relation and the distance duality relation that derives from it have also to be checked .",
    "the _ reciprocity relation _ is a relation between the source angular distance , @xmath4 , and the observer area distance , @xmath5 .",
    "the former is defined by considering a bundle of null geodesics diverging from the source and which subtends a solid angle @xmath6 ( see fig .  [ fig0bis ] ) .",
    "this bundle has a cross section @xmath7 and the source angular distance is defined by the relation @xmath8 the observer area distance @xmath5 is defined analogously by considering a null geodesic bundle converging at the observer by @xmath9 it can be shown that if photons travel along null geodesics and the geodesic deviation equation holds then these two distances are related by the reciprocity relation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a derivation ) @xmath10 regardless of the metric and matter content of the spacetime .",
    "unfortunately , the solid angle @xmath6 can not be measured so that @xmath4 is not an observable quantity .",
    "but , it can be shown that , if the number of photons is conserved , the source angular distance is related to the luminosity distance , @xmath11 , by the relation  @xcite @xmath12 it follows that there exist a _ distance duality relation _ @xmath13 that holds between the angular distance @xmath14 , the luminosity distance @xmath11 and the redshift @xmath15 .",
    "this relation can be checked observationally .    while the reciprocity relation holds as soon as photons follow null geodesic and that the geodesic deviation equation is valid , the distance duality relation will hold if the reciprocity relation is valid and the number of photon is conserved .",
    "in fact , one can show that in a metric theory of gravitation , if maxwell equations are valid , then both the reciprocity relation and the area law are satisfied and so is the distance duality relation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there are many possibilities for one of these conditions to be violated .",
    "for instance the non - conservation of the number of photons can arise from absorption by dust , but more exotic models involving photon - axion oscillation in an external magnetic field  @xcite can also be a source of violation  @xcite .",
    "note also that in principle both the reciprocity and distance duality relations hold for infinitesimal light bundles so that gravitational lensing may be a source of violation for macroscopic bodies .",
    "more drastic violations would arise from theories in which gravity is not described by a metric theory and in which photons do not follow null geodesic .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose and explore a potential new test of the distance duality relation based on sunyaev - zeldovich  @xcite ( sz ) and x - ray measurements of clusters of galaxies . in section  [ sec_2 ] , we first show that when the relation ( [ reci ] ) does not hold , cluster data do not give a measurement of the angular distance but of @xmath16 where @xmath17 in section  [ sec_3 ] , we use existing cluster data to search for any hint that @xmath18 may be excluded and then we discuss in section  [ sec_4 ] the possibility to improve the accuracy of the test .",
    "galaxy clusters are known as the largest gravitationally bound systems in the universe .",
    "they contain large quantities of hot and ionized gas which temperatures are typically @xmath19  k. the spectral properties of intra - cluster gas show that it radiates through bremsstrahlung in the x - ray domain .",
    "therefore , this gas can modify the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectral energy distribution through inverse compton interaction of photons with free electrons .",
    "this is the so - called sz effect .",
    "it induces a decrement in the cmb brightness at low frequencies and an increment at high frequencies .",
    "the possibility of using the sz effect together with x - ray emission of galaxy clusters to measure angular distances was suggested soon after the sz effect was pointed out ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . used",
    "jointly , they provide an independent method to determine distance scales and thus to measure the value of the hubble constant ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    in brief , the method is based on the fact that the cmb temperature ( i.e. brightness ) decrement due to the sz effect is given by @xmath20 where the bar refers to an average over the line of sight and @xmath21 is the typical size of the line of sight in the cluster .",
    "@xmath22 is the electron temperature and @xmath23 the electron density . besides , the total x - ray surface brightness is given by @xmath24 where the volume @xmath25 of the cluster is given in terms of its angular diameter by @xmath26 .",
    "it follows that @xmath27 the usual approach  @xcite , is to assume the distance duality relation ( @xmath18 ) so that forming the ratio @xmath28 eliminates @xmath23 .",
    "then , using a measurement of the angular diameter of the cluster and eq .",
    "( [ thetac ] ) one gets an estimate of the angular diameter distance and thus the hubble constant . as a first conclusion , we point out that this method determines the angular distance only if the distance duality relation is valid . therefore one needs to be careful when using such data to test the distance duality relation .    to make this point more precise ,",
    "let us come back to the details of the method assuming the classical @xmath29-model for the galaxy cluster @xcite , that is assuming that the electron density of the hot intra - cluster gas has a profile of the form @xmath30^{-3\\beta/2}.\\ ] ] for @xmath31 and 0 otherwise , @xmath32 being the maximum extension of the cluster .",
    "the temperature decrement due to the sz effect in the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectrum is given by @xmath33 where we have assumed that the temperature of the hot gas , @xmath22 , is independent of @xmath34 [ @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the length of the path along the line of sight inside the halo of the cluster and @xmath37 is the angular radial position projected on the celestial sphere from the cluster center .",

    "( [ thetac ] ) . when @xmath53 , what is thus extracted from the data is an estimate of @xmath54 .",
    "it follows from this analysis that , if we do not assume the distance duality relation to hold , what is in fact determined is @xmath55 which differs from the angular distance .",
    "we thus have access to @xmath56 which reduces to the angular diameter distance only when the distance duality relation holds .",
    "our method is straightforward once we have made the previous remark . using a data set of angular distances determined from the combination of x - ray and sz measurements",
    ", we have access to @xmath57 . to get @xmath50",
    "one needs to know the angular diameter distance .",
    "one possibility , and probably the most robust , is to estimate it from its theoretical expression in a friedmann - lematre universe @xmath58\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is defined by @xmath61 respectively for @xmath62 positive , null and negative . the function @xmath63 is explicitly given , for a @xmath64-cdm model by @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are respectively the present matter and cosmological constant density parameters .",
    "we estimate @xmath68 as @xmath69 the error bars on this quantity will be estimated by a combination of the data error bars and of the 1@xmath70 error bars on the cosmological parameters as obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath71 note that in the case of a detection of @xmath53 , the interpretation of the signal is not trivial since a varying equation of state may be undistinguishable from a violation of the distance duality relation .",
    "in such a case going back to snia data to get @xmath11 and of x - ray data to get @xmath16 may help to break this degeneracy .",
    "we use the catalog by reese _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that contains 18 galaxy clusters , with redshifts ranging from 0.142 to 0.784 , all observed in x - ray and sz ( see table  [ table1 ] ) . combining these data as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec_2 ] together with the theoretical estimate of the angular distance , we get a measurement of @xmath68 for each cluster , using eq .",

    ".the 18 clusters of the reese catalog with their redshift used in our analysis .",
    "@xmath72 refers to the angular distance determined in ref .",
    "@xcite assuming that the distance duality relation holds .",
    "it leads , once this hypothesis is relaxed , to a measurement of @xmath50 with 1@xmath70 error bars . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the question is then whether this data set is compatible with @xmath18 or not .",
    "as can be seen from the original data ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the error bars on @xmath72 are not symmetric . to derive the distribution of @xmath50 we proceed in the following way .",
    "we first assume that the data points are independent so that the likelyhood @xmath73 can be factorized as @xmath74 .",
    "we then introduce @xmath75 defined as @xmath76 if the probabilities @xmath77 are gaussian , @xmath75 reduces to the standard @xmath78 . in one dimension",
    ", a variation @xmath79 around the minimum of @xmath75 will give the @xmath80 error bar .",
    "to proceed , we need to know the probabilities @xmath77 . without any further information , we assume that they follow a gaussian distribution that is that @xmath81 corresponds to a probability distribution function of the form @xmath82 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we perform this analysis using two data sets .",
    "the first set , labelled 1 , contains all the clusters , while in the second , labelled 2 , we have removed the point at @xmath83 that lies outside of the other data points .",
    "this point corresponds to abell 370 that clearly shows an apparent bimodal shape in optical and x - ray data , making its modelling as a single spherical potential a likely over - simplification for our purpose .",
    "the result is summarized on the plot  [ fig3 ] where we have displayed the function @xmath75 , its minimum and the 1@xmath70 confidence level .",
    "[ fig2 ] compares the probability distribution function of @xmath50 to a gaussian distribution fitted to the data .",
    "we obtain from our analysis that @xmath84 for the first data set and @xmath85 for the second .",
    "0.2 cm    0.2 cm    additionally we have analyzed , for the second data set ( i.e. without abell 370 ) , separately the low redshift ( @xmath86 ) data and the high redshift data .",
    "we find for the low redshift set @xmath87 and for the high redshift set @xmath88 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the largest departure from @xmath18 is at small redshifts .",
    "these results and the one obtained for the whole data set suggest that there is no significant violation of the distance duality relation from combined x - ray and sz measurements .",
    "testing for the distance duality relation and/or the reciprocity relation can give some insight on the puzzling apparent acceleration of the universe derived from cosmological observations . to distinguish between various models , one needs several complementary tests to the reconstruction of the hubble parameter as a function of the scale factor ( or equivalently of the equation of state ) .",
    "examples of such tests are the test of the poisson equation on large scales , the test of the constancy of the fundamental constants and the test of the reciprocity relation .",
    "figure  [ fig0 ] illustrates how the combination of these tests can help in identifying class of models .",
    "we have then shown that observations of galaxy clusters offer a test of the distance duality relation .",
    "in particular , using sz and x - ray measurements of the same clusters give an estimate of @xmath16 .",
    "an important consequence is that x - ray / sz combined analysis does not give a measurement of the angular distances when the distance duality relation is violated .",
    "testing the distance duality relation was already proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work ,",
    "different sets of data were used such as type ia supernovae data to get the luminosity distance , and the friib radio galaxies , x - ray clusters and compact radio data to derive angular distances .",
    "interestingly , a general three parameter form of @xmath68 was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on general arguments about the violation of the conservation of the number of photons . using their data",
    ", @xcite found a 2@xmath70 violation of the distance duality relation , mainly caused by an excess brightening of snia at redshift larger than 0.5 .",
    "this analysis also allowed to put constraints on systematic effects , such as snia extinction or evolution , that may bias apparent magnitudes .",
    "the analysis of the reese _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite cluster catalogue has shown that @xmath18 is marginally consistent with the data . in our study , we have not searched for a fit of a general expression for @xmath68 .",
    "our main concern was first to use x - ray and sz combined measurements of galaxy clusters to check whether the critical value @xmath18 was compatible with the data .",
    "although we found that a value of @xmath50 sightly lower than 1 is favored , drawing any conclusion on the possible discrepancy between the distances as predicted in the concordance model and those determined by our x - ray / sz combined analysis is premature .",
    "there are indeed several systematic effects that may bias our derivation of @xmath68 , like over - simplification of cluster symmetry ( substructures , tri - axiallity ) , or of their temperature and luminosity radial profiles .",
    "for example , the clusters that deviate most from the @xmath89 line on fig.2 are those that clearly show bimodal structures from x - ray , sz and optical images ( abell 370 , abell 773 and abell 1689 ) .",
    "in contrast , those showing a single emission region with spherical shape lie very close to @xmath89 .",
    "it is interesting to note that when the three most bimodal clusters are removed from the sample , the reese _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite remaining clusters lead to @xmath90 which is compatible to @xmath18 at a 2@xmath70 level .",
    "the shape , temperature distribution etc ... , are key points to control in order to reduce the systematics that limit the accuracy of this test .    therefore , we will have to make sure that the marginal trend . ]",
    "@xmath91 survives further explorations of this method with new data .",
    "this trend is indeed related to the fact that x - ray / sz analysis systematically favors a rather low value of the hubble constant . besides",
    ", the analysis of the low and high redshift subsets and the fact that the largest departure from @xmath18 is at low redshift suggest that there is no violation of the distance duality relation .",
    "in particular , parametric forms , such as the one proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , predict a cumulative effect with redshift .",
    "more specifically , a larger number of clusters spread over the whole redshift range and showing simple apparent geometry ( i.e. as compact and spherical as possible ) must be selected carefully .",
    "it will improve to lower systematics , to reduce errors bars on cluster data and , in turn , to provide much better angular distance estimates , making the test of the distance duality relation from x - ray and sz measurement an efficient method",
