    "* see their section 2.2 ) , but is outlined here .",
    "the act maps are passed through a matched filter to extract the amplitude of the temperature decrement of clusters modeled with the universal pressure profile of @xcite  hereafter `` the a10 profile''with a fixed scale @xmath104 .",
    "this scale is related to the more usual parameterization of the characteristic scale by @xmath105 given the best - fit concentration parameter from @xcite , @xmath106 . although the filter accounts for the effects of the beam in the signal template , its normalization is chosen to return the central decrement of the corresponding unconvolved cluster signal .",
    "the central temperature decrement is scaled to a central compton parameter using the standard non - relativistic sze frequency dependence @xcite .",
    "using @xmath8 and assuming that the pressure profile follows the ( mass dependent ) a10 profile , one can estimate what the actual central compton parameter should be .",
    "while this measure carries some assumptions about the physics of the cluster and the relation between pressure and mass ( i.e. , it is model - dependent ) , it is completely independent from the reported dynamical masses and it is thus still useful to compare both quantities .",
    "the central compton parameter is referred to as @xmath9 , as usual .",
    "a more detailed discussion about @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be found in @xcite .",
    "our third measurement is the integrated compton signal .",
    "large integration areas tend to give measurements that are more robust against the effects of cluster physics such as active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback @xcite , and to projection effects @xcite .",
    "dynamical masses are usually measured at @xmath23 ( see section [ sec : masses ] ) , providing therefore a measurement of the size of the cluster .",
    "since the parameterization of the a10 profile is given in terms of quantities measured at @xmath107 , we convert values from @xmath23 to @xmath107 using a @xcite profile ( hereafter nfw profile ) and the mass  concentration relation of @xcite .",
    "combined with the dynamical information , this sets the scale of the filter through @xmath108 .",

    "this is assumed to be enough so that a measure of the velocity dispersion of these galaxies at such distance is representative of all member galaxies ( with and without a redshift measurement ) in this bin .",
    "the distribution of apertures is asymetric , with an average @xmath376 ( 90th and 10th percentiles ) , and is a function of the angular diameter distance @xmath326 and the size of the cluster ( hence the mass ) .",

    "* ) , although some observations do support the expectations from simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we correct our measurement to a measurement at @xmath23 using this profile and measure a `` corrected '' @xmath4 . since the re - calculation of @xmath23 for a lower ( higher ) mass means that we have under(over-)estimated the actual sampling aperture , this procedure is iterated until the radius converges , which takes 34 iterations .",
    "the average correction to the velocity dispersion is 0.91 , and the average mass correction derived from equation ( [ eq : mass ] ) is 0.79 .",
    "the correction to @xmath23 is of the same order as that of the velocity dispersion , and we use these corrected radii to estimate corrected @xmath10 , which are on average 0.91 of those reported in table [ t : sze ] .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : sze_par ] , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are measured completely independent from the dynamical masses , so these values are not affected .",
    "the scaling relations estimated from the corrected numbers are shown in each panel of figure [ fig : scaling ] as a black dotted line .",
    "the effect of the correction is to flatten the slopes and lower the normalizations , with @xmath378 and @xmath379 for @xmath380 .",
    "the resulting scatter is slightly lower but consistent with the values reported in table [ t : scaling ] for all estimators .",
    "we also estimated , for comparison , the correction obtained when applying the surface pressure correction term @xcite , assuming an nfw profile .",
    "this correction is directly applied to the mass measurement .",
    "the average correction to the present sample is 0.73 .",

    "however , this correction is applicable specifically to the virial mass measurement ( i.e. , estimated from the virial theorem ) , so should be taken with care , especially for a population that may be dominated by dynamically disturbed clusters like the present one .",
    "while the functional forms of equations ( [ eq : scaling ] ) are well motivated from self - similar evolution for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath8 is dependent on the adopted filtering of the maps @xcite and we have no a priori information on how it should evolve with redshift for a fixed mass .",
    "we have explored a range of functional forms for the redshift dependence of equation ( [ eq : ytilde ] ) using the set of models discussed in section [ sec : corrections ] .",
    "we find that , while the results are consistent , the models prefer a slightly lower redshift evolution of @xmath8 at fixed mass .",
    "specifically , the scaling resulting from equation ( [ eq : ytilde ] ) could , at low ( @xmath381 ) redshifts , bias the masses high ( on average ) by as much as @xmath382 .",

    "@xcite used a multi - wavelength data - set combining x - rays , sze and the information provided in this work to estimate the cluster mass using several mass proxies which are in statistical agreement , with a combined mass estimate of @xmath396 .",

    "more noteworthy , however , is the peculiar velocity of the bcg , @xmath397 , different from zero at @xmath398 .",

    "<S> we present the first dynamical mass estimates and scaling relations for a sample of sunyaev  </S>",
    "<S> zeldovich effect ( sze ) selected galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the sample consists of 16 massive clusters detected with the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) over a 455 @xmath0 area of the southern sky . </S>",
    "<S> deep multi - object spectroscopic observations were taken to secure intermediate - resolution ( @xmath1@xmath2 ) spectra and redshifts for @xmath3 member galaxies on average per cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical masses @xmath4 of the clusters have been calculated using simulation - based scaling relations between velocity dispersion and mass . </S>",
    "<S> the sample has a median redshift @xmath5 and a median mass @xmath6 with a lower limit @xmath7 , consistent with the expectations for the act southern sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> these masses are compared to the act sze properties of the sample , specifically , the match - filtered central sze amplitude @xmath8 , the central compton parameter @xmath9 , and the integrated compton signal @xmath10 , which we use to derive sze - mass scaling relations . </S>",
    "<S> all sze estimators correlate with dynamical mass with low intrinsic scatter ( @xmath11 ) , in agreement with numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the effects of various systematic effects on these scaling relations , including the correlation between observables and the influence of dynamically disturbed clusters . using the three - dimensional information available </S>",
    "<S> , we divide the sample into relaxed and disturbed clusters and find that @xmath12 of the clusters are disturbed . </S>",
    "<S> there are hints that disturbed systems might bias the scaling relations but given the current sample sizes these differences are not significant ; further studies including more clusters are required to assess the impact of these clusters on the scaling relations . </S>"
