    "gravity makes all selfgravitating fluid bodies spherical .",
    "thus the spherical symmetry of non - rotating neutron stars , which are real objects , is their intrinsic property , not an idealization .",
    "neutron stars are relativistic objects , with mass of order @xmath0 enclosed within 10 - 20 km .",
    "gravity of such a compact mass distribution is strong enough to require relativistic description . in the following we focus on gravitational field contribution to the neutron star masses in general relativity .",
    "the problem of the energy distribution of gravitational field remains an unsettled issue in general relativity @xcite mainly because of the lack of proper energy - momentum tensor for gravitational field .",
    "however , for static , spherically symmetric space - time no controversy exists and relevant matter and gravity energies can be unambiguousely defined @xcite .",
    "our main concern here is to study if neutron stars could shed some new light on the problem of gravitational field energy and its localization .    to calculate both matter and gravitational field contributions to the neutron star mass we solve the einstein s field equations for the static , spherically symmetric metric and a given equation of state of dense matter .",
    "the metric is @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath4 .",
    "dense matter in neutron stars is thought to be in a liquid state , hence it is described by the perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy denisty , @xmath7 is the pressure and @xmath8 is the four velocity . for the neutron star matter",
    "both energy density and pressure are uniquely determined by the baryon number density , @xmath9 , hence the equation of state is of barotropic form , @xmath10 . in this paper",
    "we employ a number of realistic equations of state , described in some details in sect .",
    "[ eosnm ] .    using the einstein s equations one finds that functions @xmath3 and @xmath2 satisfy ordinary differential equations    [ myeq ] @xmath11    the metric ( 1 ) has to be continuous in the whole space . for this to happen , at the stellar boundary , @xmath12 , the internal metric has to go over into the external schwarzschild metric .",
    "there is a vacuum outside the star and the matter energy - momentum tensor vanishes .",
    "the metric functions at the boundary should satisfy the condition @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mass of the star .    from eqs.(2 ) one derives the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation that describes nonrotating compact objects in the hydrostatic equilibrium : @xmath15 here we denote by @xmath16 the integral @xmath17 .",
    "usually @xmath16 is referred to as `` the mass within the radius @xmath4 '' .",
    "this name is rather misleading , as it suggests that only matter energy density is responsible for building the neutron star mass @xmath18 .",
    "it is our prime goal here to calculate the gravitational energy contribution to @xmath14 . in the following we shall be using the differential form of the @xmath16 definition , @xmath19 choosing an appropriate equation of state of dense matter @xmath20 and the boundary conditions we solve this set of equations for different values of central density @xmath21 obtaining the whole family of configurations of compact objects in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we report here calculations for four equations of state , which we denote as a18 , a18+@xmath23v+uix * , fpr and ms ( see sect .",
    "[ eosnm ] ) .",
    "these four eos have been chosen from about twenty eos we studied solely to make the plots clear .",
    "the results of our calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ns_konf ] .",
    "numerical values of the neutron stars masses for these equations of states are given in the table [ tab : masses ] .",
    "we show parameters corresponding to the standard neutron star mass @xmath24 , and to the maximum mass neutron star , which is different for every equation of state .",
    ".computed neutron star masses . for each equation of state",
    "the first line shows the value of the central density of @xmath25 neutron star , and in the second row the central density of the maximum mass neutron star and the value of this mass are given .",
    "[ tab : masses ] [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     akmal , pandharipande and ravenhall used variational chain summation methods and created new argonne @xmath26 two - nucleon interaction which fits all of the nucleon - nucleon scattering data in the nijmegen data base .",
    "the a18+@xmath27+uix * model comprises the boost correction @xmath27 to the two - nucleon interaction , which gives the leading relativistic effect of order @xmath28 and the three - nucleon interaction urbana model ix * which predicts a transition in nucleon matter to a phase with neutral pion condensate at the density @xmath29 for pure neutron matter and @xmath30 for symmetric nuclear matter .    the energy density for both a18 and a18+@xmath27+uix * models can be given by a common formula ,     @xmath31 for a18+@xmath27+uix * with @xmath32 or @xmath33 additionaly : @xmath34 where : @xmath35 , @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "the parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are common for these two models .    for a18 model",
    "the parameters are : @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    for a18+@xmath27+uix * model the parameters are : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath51 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "first we change the spherical coordinates to the cartesian ones . using transformation",
    "@xmath69 we obtain the metric in cartesian coordinates ,    @xmath70    the components of the covariant metric tensor are @xmath71 the determinant of this metric tensor is @xmath72 .",

    "the same result was obtained by @xcite .",
    "for metric in cartesian coordinates the @xmath87 potential is @xmath88 the nonzero componets of @xmath87 are @xmath89 where prime denotes derivative of the function @xmath2 with respect to @xmath90 . inserting the components of the contravariant metric tensor and using the equation ( [ me2 ] ) we have     @xmath91 according to the definition ( [ tensorm ] )",
    "one finds the 00 component to be @xmath92 after taking partial derivatives of potential @xmath93 and using eqs .",
    "( [ me1 ] , [ me2 ] , [ me3 ] ) the mller complex reads @xmath94 using the definition of the function @xmath3 and rearranging terms we obtain @xmath95 the mller pseudotensor is @xmath96 and one can easily find that in this prescription the gravitational energy density is given by very simple formula @xmath97 .",
    "for the metric in cartesian coordinates we have @xmath98 the determinant of the metric tensor is @xmath99 and the contravariant component @xmath100 is @xmath101 , so landau - lifshitz complex reads @xmath102 inserting the components of contravariant metric tensor , taking partial derivatives and using eqs .",
    "( [ me1 ] , [ me2 ] , [ me3 ] ) we obtain @xmath103 for @xmath104 we have the schwarzschild solution . so taking @xmath105 we find how does the landau - lifszyc complex look like in the vacuum outside the star : the vacuum energy density is negative . the same result was obtained by virbhadra ( see eq.(16 ) in @xcite with @xmath106 and wiht @xmath107 ) . because @xmath108 we finally find the gravitaional field energy density in landau - lifshitz form to be @xmath109",
