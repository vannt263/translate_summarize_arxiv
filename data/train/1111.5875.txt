    "the redistribution of the physical fields is a quite widespread phenomenon in nature .",
    "if we consider convective systems with dissipation , there are then two major effects which work in the opposite directions : diffusion ( may be turbulent ) , which leads to the homogenization of the fields , and nonlinear interactions , which can produce large gradients and , in fact , cause the self - organization of the system . the most impressive examples of such behavior is the appearance of coherent structures in convective systems @xcite , topological pumping @xcite and turbulent diamagnetism in the dynamo @xcite .    the considered effects demonstrate pumping of the fields in physical space to some domain of a scale smaller than the main scale of the system .",
    "if the subdomain is quite small , then it is clear that pumping should also be accompanied by the redistribution of the fields in wave space , e.g. , the energy fluxes between the different scales relevant to the nonlinear process , @xmath0-effect and separation in the scales of magnetic helicity @xcite in the mean - field dynamo theory @xcite , already mentioned coherent structures in convection .",
    "it is worth noting that fluxes exist in the wave space even in quasistationary states provided that the scales of the energy injection into the system and the energy dissipation are different , see the introduction to the problem in @xcite and the review of some recent results in @xcite .",
    "in general , such fluxes can be defined for various physical quantities , and the direction of their propagation is prescribed by many factors : by the nature of the considered quantity , the number of dimensions in the system and even the geometry of the system ( as we shall see latter ) .",
    "restricting our further research to convection , we recall that for the 3d homogeneous isotropic turbulence ( in the absence of rotation ) there is a direct energy cascade of the kinetic energy @xmath1 from the large scales to the small scales , where dissipation takes place .",
    "the second invariant of the navier - stokes equation in 3d in the inviscid limit is kinetic helicity @xmath2 .",
    "however , for isotropic turbulence its mean value is zero and its mean flux is also zero .",
    "the situation changes in 2d , where the cascade of kinetic energy is inverse : from the small to the large scales .",
    "two - dimensional idealization was a useful approach for describing geophysical turbulence and was able to capture many important features of the flow .",
    "with regard to the more realistic models , one should consider quasi - geostrophic flows , which in view of their properties are somewhere inbetween 3d and 2d .",
    "in such a flow , one still has 3 dimensions , but the dependence of angular rotation ( @xmath3 coordinate ) on direction is degenerated , see @xcite .",
    "this flow is known by its structures elongated along @xmath3 .",
    "the perpendicular scale of these structures is very small and defined by the value of the ekman number @xmath4 . at the critical rayleigh number ,",
    "the first columnar mode has horizontal and vertical scales @xmath5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath6 in the earth s liquid core , and the horizontal scale is extremely small . as follows from our previous study for the rotating rectangular box heated from below with periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal plane @xcite , these structures can supply kinetic energy in both directions : to the larger as well as to the smaller scales , which can be important for understanding the energy budget in the planetary cores and for constructing semi - empirical models of turbulence .",
    "however , the solution of the same equations in plane geometry differs from that in the sphere .",
    "in cartesian geometry , the increase of the heat sources characterized by the rayleigh number leads to the gradual increase of the number of growing wave modes with smaller and larger scales than the scale of the first mode . however , in spherical geometry the increase of @xmath7 excites rossby waves . as a result",
    "the columns start to oscillate in the direction of the axis of rotation of the sphere , which leads to the rotation of columns around it .",
    "the direction of this rotation is defined by the slope of the outer boundary . for a spherical shell it is prograde and for a concave surface it has the opposite direction @xcite .",
    "the appearance of this rotation ( even differential ) corresponds to the axi - symmetrical mode in spectral space .",
    "thus the scenarios of energy transfer in the plane and in spherical geometries can be different .",
    "this is the motivation of our present study . here ,",
    "following @xcite , we discuss the fluxes of kinetic energy in the standard bousinesq equations used in the geodynamo for the different magnitudes of @xmath7 and compare the results with the cartesian geometry survey .",
    "the thermal convection process driven by the flows of incompressible fluid ( @xmath8 ) in the boussinesq approximation in a spherical shell @xmath9 rotating with the angular velocity @xmath10 in the @xmath11-direction is described by the navier - stokes equation @xmath12 and the heat flux equation for temperature fluctuations @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the solution of the heat flux equation with fixed temperatures ( 1 , 0 ) at the boundaries ( @xmath16 ) in the absence of convection .",

    "the helicity depends on the regularity of the flow and ratio of the coriolis and archemedean forces : the increase of the heat sources leads to the spread of convection to the taylor cylinder ( tc ) accompanied by strong differential rotation . as a result ,",
    "@xmath2 changes sign in the middle of the spherical shell in tc , being positive at the inner - core boundary ( icb ) and negative at the core - mantle boundary ( cmb ) in the northern hemisphere ( the helicity in tc still retains its dipole structure with respect to the equatorial plane ) .",
    "before we refer the reader to the more detailed study of kinetic helicity , including the influence of the magnetic field on @xmath2 @xcite , let us stress that , from the point of view of the mean - field theory @xcite , @xmath2 in tc and outside it are not the same : in tc @xmath2 is produced by the large - scale motions near the boundaries , and in the outer part it has a cyclonic nature with @xmath63 , so that the separation of the fields into the large and small scales , adopted in the theory , is valid .",

    "the slope of the spectrum for the developed rotating convection ( solid circles ) is less steep than for the non - rotating field because of the blocking of the nonlinear energy transfer over the spectrum by rotation .    to study this problem",
    "we recall the technique discussed in @xcite and our recent papers @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to allocate a sphere of radius @xmath74 in fourier space and consider the evolution in time of kinetic energy @xmath75 inside the sphere taking into account the integral flux of the kinetic energy @xmath76 from the outer part of the sphere in wave space with @xmath77 .",

    "this is the motivation to consider further only the @xmath74-dependency .",
    "in contrast to our previous study @xcite we do not proceed with local - flux functions @xmath84 , because the spherical case exhibits more irregular behavior of the flux than the flat geometry .",

    "all the curves , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for our regimes ,    0.0 cm    satisfy condition @xmath86 for the large @xmath74 confirming the conservation of kinetic energy in the non - linear term of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "it is obvious that rotation changes the energy transfer substantially . in the non - rotating regime",
    ", @xmath85 is always negative , which means that the large scales feed the small scales ( the direct cascade of energy ) .",
    "for the small @xmath74 , the slope of increasing @xmath87 is constant , which means that the flux to the small scales is non - local .",
    "the same situation holds for the larger @xmath74 , where @xmath85 increases , but the slope also remains constant . due to this non - locality our solution differs from that for the cartesian geometry in @xcite .    for the geostrophic convection with small @xmath7 we observe the inverse cascade of energy for @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "the break of the curve at @xmath90 means that , due to the sharp decrease of the spectrum , approximately the whole kinetic energy is in the sphere and @xmath85 tends to zero .",
    "this is the reason why the direct cascade can not be seen in the plot for large @xmath74 .",
    "the increase of @xmath7 decreases the relative flux to the axi - symmetrical mode twice . for larger @xmath74 , @xmath85 changes sign , which corresponds to the transition from the inverse cascade regime for @xmath91 to the direct cascade of the kinetic energy for @xmath92 .",
    "the rotation changes not only the direction of energy transfer over the spectrum , but also the structure of the triangle in wave space , when two modes with @xmath93 and @xmath94 produce the third mode @xmath95 . to check this possibility ,",

    "the shift of the extrema from the zero point describes the non - locality of interactions .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained as follows : the extrema correspond to the period ( @xmath73 ) between the local maxima in the spectra , see fig .",

    "the spectra on @xmath72 accumulate various scales in the @xmath3-directions .",
    "the pure statistics in the spherical problem may be more important : if the number of the columns is @xmath100 in the flat geometry , their number is much smaller in the spherical geometry , because they are mainly distributed near tc .",
    "the other reason is that considered in @xcite : @xmath101 for the columns is larger than that in the spherical geometry ( @xmath90 ) and we stand far away from the similarity region , even if we have similar resolutions in the models .",
    "that is why cartesian geometry is so often used in mhd simulations to get scalings .",
    "we have tried to present the regimes of geostrophic convection , well - known in the geodynamo community , by traditional tools of the turbulent community .",
    "even if the solution is quasi - stationary in physical space , there are non - zero fluxes of energy in wave space , proving that convection is not localized in wave space .",
    "our results demonstrate that recent simulations for the usually used grids do not exhibit local transfer of energy , even without rotation .",
    "rotation brings inverse flux into the first harmonics . in",
    "this way we can consider the excitation of the axi - symmetrical rotation of the columns around geographical axes to be the result of the inverse cascade . this phenomenon has no analog in the case of convection in the box , where rotation destroys rotating rolls with @xmath102 , for details of the kppers - lortz instability refer to @xcite . in some sense ,",
    "the periodical boundary condition used in the cartesian geometry corresponds to the case with the zero curvature of the boundary considered in @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from the presented simulations , the relative location of energy transfer will increase with increasing resolution of the model , but we believe that the mechanism of excitation of the axi - symmetrical flow due to the non - local inverse energy transfer will be the same . we hope that these results will also be interesting for solar modeling , where this technique could be used to check the energy exchange between the different radial layers and could thus help in constructing more realistic turbulent models ."
