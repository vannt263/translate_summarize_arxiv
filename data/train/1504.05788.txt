    "in the context of the string theory landscape @xcite , there are various possibilities that multiple vacua can be produced whose semiclassical tunnelling process from metastable vacua to new vacua can occur . in this respect",
    ", it can allow us to argue that nucleation of spherical symmetric regions , namely bubble in space which are constructed by a new vacuum and expand into the old vacuum .",
    "one of any bubble universe created by such first - order phase transition may be regarded as our universe @xcite .",
    "in particular , inspired by the bubble universe scenario , an accelerated expansion of the universe generated by its vacuum energy would give a natural explanation for inflation realization in the early universe as discussed old inflation @xcite or open inflation @xcite scenario in the past . if the bubble universe would be inside the old bubble universe , the so - called parent universe , we are mainly interested in how much information we know or detect through any observational signature of the parent universe .    in the viewpoint of anthropic principle @xcite , it is possible that several universes take their own choices of natural constants .",
    "it can allow us to argue a possibility that landscape vacua have different values of gravitational constants as well as cosmological constants . in this paper ,",
    "the bubble universes have their own different gravitational constants and it can give us explore how a different gravitational constant in the exterior universe affect and relates to physical ( especially observational ) quantities for the observer in the interior bubble universe ( see also works @xcite for the aim ) .    in order to such model building",
    "that each bubble universe has its own different gravitational constant , it is useful to employ the jbd theory @xcite ( see book @xcite for review ) .",
    "this theory can achieve a varying gravitational constant by identified a vacuum expectation value of the scalar field with gravitational constants in the original , the so - called jordan frame .",
    "therefore we will use this theory to construct our model and investigate the consequence of the model to our ( child ) bubble universe , where the child bubble is inside the parent bubble with different constants .",
    "inflationary scenario can give a remarkably successful way of generating a consistent spectrum of curvature perturbations with recent cosmological observations , such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and galaxy survey to explore a large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "the quantum fluctuations generated in a exponential expansion of the early stage of the universe were spread out a cosmological horizon scale and their wavelengths are then pushed to superhorizon size , which can be reduced to classical perturbations seeding cosmic structure . after inflation ends , they reenter the horizon in a radiation dominated phase and can be detected by such as cmb observation ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "the recent data by planck satellite @xcite gave a perfectly agreement with the prediction of inflationary theory .    in order to discuss an observational consequence of bubble universes with different gravitational constants , we analyze density perturbations during an inflationary phase based on the jbd theory .",
    "note that although several inflationary models with / without bubble formations and the accompanying density perturbations are discussed based on the scalar - tensor gravity theories including the jbd theory @xcite , the jbd scalar field is assumed to be an inflaton in those models . in the present paper , however , we assume that there exists an inflaton field in addition to the jbd scalar field , which is used to fix only two different gravitational constants .",
    "if the superhorizon perturbations propagate even though their amplitudes freeze out and approach to the boundary of the bubble universe , they would be scattered by the layer called bubble wall , separating a new and old vacuum .",
    "namely when one join the interior and exterior perturbation mode over the bubble wall , a reflected wave can be produced . hence if there would be a possibility that one can get information of outside bubble , that is only way to analyze perturbations coming back from superhorizon scales outside bubble as a trace of the outer region ( see @xcite in a different setup , but in which a similar effect has been studied ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to obtain physical signature on a primordial curvature perturbation at superhorizon scales , which is affected by the boundary of bubble .",
    "in particular , we can provide how superhorizon mode is modified by the effect of different gravitational constant in the exterior universe by employing the jbd theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we show our model setup and discuss a nucleation of bubble universe and a static bubble wall solution . in section 3 , we study dynamics of bubble wall after a nucleation . in section 4 ,",
    "we adopt linear perturbation theory to the system and match perturbation modes in both sides over the bubble wall .",
    "in particular , our calculation is the case for de sitter background .",
    "then we discuss the effect of different gravitational constant on the obtained results in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to conclusion .",
    "we consider the model of bubble universes which have their own gravitational constants .",
    "the wall of the bubble can divide two bubble universes whose constants have different values .",
    "we investigate the effect of different gravitational constant on the superhorizon scale perturbation .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     in fig.[fig : modulation - power2 ] , we plot how each correction contributes to the total modulation of power spectrum .",
    "we find that the term @xmath0 can be ignored , while @xmath1 plays an important role in the superhorizon scale @xmath2 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath3 plays an important role in the subhorizon scale , which gives an increasing function of @xmath4 with oscillations for @xmath5 .",
    "this subhorizon effect comes from the one proportional to @xmath6 in ( [ eq : s2 ] ) .",
    "that is transmitted wave propagating from the exterior universe .",
    "note that the contribution of @xmath3 becomes larger than unity , which means a breakdown of perturbative approach for @xmath7 .",
    "the most effective term comes mainly from the one proportional to @xmath6 in ( [ eq : s2 ] ) .",
    "it gives the condition ( [ eq : kmax ] ) .",
    "we can then evaluate a breakdown scale @xmath8 of our perturbative treatment for @xmath7 as @xmath9 for @xmath10 , we find a limited maximum value of wavenumber as @xmath11 , beyond which we can not use this formula .",
    "of course , these plots also depend on the parameter of the proper time @xmath12 when the waves are scattered .",
    "however the plot shows a similar behavior when @xmath13 , although we set @xmath14 in fig.[fig : modulation - power ] . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath15 gives no modulation of power spectrum since the wall radius converges to a constant value .    in the observational point of view",
    ", the observed power spectrum would be generated by a wave scattered at the wall around which an @xmath16-folding number takes about @xmath17 . if an inflationary period is much longer than @xmath18-foldings , it maybe difficult to observe such effect on the cmb power spectrum because the observed modulation is generated at @xmath19 when the wall radius is almost constant .",
    "so we have to fine - tune the inflationary model whose period ends around @xmath18-foldings . in this case , the value of the modulation is determined by the scattered waves at the wall position when inflation has just started and the radius of the wall is expanding .",
    "it will show the deviation from a standard inflationary model .    note that if the initial radius of the wall is much larger than the horizon scale @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 , we may observe the original perturbation before the scattering at large scale .",
    "so there may not appear the modulation for such a larger scale perturbation .",
    "in the original jordan frame , the gravitational constants are different in both vacua , which is given by the vev s of the scalar field @xmath22 by eq .",
    "( [ rel : g - phi ] ) . since the scalar field @xmath23",
    "is given by eq .",
    "( [ sol : phi - r - wallb ] ) , the value changes from @xmath24 to @xmath25 suddenly near the bubble wall .",
    "hence the gravitational constants are almost constant both inside and outside of the bubble except near the wall region .",
    "the vev s in a false(@xmath26 ) and true(@xmath27 ) vacua are written by @xmath28 then we find @xmath29 which gives @xmath30    hence when we analyze the effect of the different gravitational constant in a false vacuum , we should study the dependence of @xmath31 on our results discussed in the previous section . if one wishes to set almost the same values for both gravitational constants , one needs to choose a negative value of @xmath31 such that @xmath32 , which implies that the value of @xmath23 in a false vacuum is close to that in the true vacuum ( @xmath25 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : g - b120 ] , we show the gravitational constants for two values of @xmath31 ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .     for @xmath33 and @xmath35 , by setting @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we have used the radial coordinate @xmath38 in the jordan frame .",
    "@xmath39 denotes the position of bubble wall .",
    ", width=245 ]    since the parameter @xmath31 is related to the surface density of the wall @xmath40 as @xmath41 which is one of the key parameters in our results , we can discuss the effect of the different gravitational constant by changing @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , the ratio of two gravitational constants is given by @xmath43}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now we study how change of the gravitational constant outside of our universe affects on the final results obtained in the einstein frame in the previous section .",
    "the effects are found mainly in two points ; one is the bubble nucleation rate and the other is the power spectrum of curvature perturbations , which we shall discuss in due order .",
    "the bubble nucleation rate is given by ( [ eq : gamma - ims ] ) and ( [ eq : ims ] ) , which is described as @xmath44\\ , , \\label{eq : gamma - sigma}\\ ] ] in the limit qof @xmath45 .",
    "this result shows that the larger value of @xmath42 makes tunnelling process suppressed highly by a huge exponential factor .",
    "if @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 , which means the difference of gravitational constants is very small , the nucleation probability becomes very high .",
    "this is easily understood as follows : by assuming that @xmath48 and @xmath49 are fixed , when the value of @xmath31 changes from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , the surface tension @xmath42 takes the value from @xmath52 to @xmath51 .",
    "it is because the wall barrier height is constant but the width becomes narrower as @xmath31 decreases .",
    "when we change the gravitational constant in a false vacuum , however , if we fix @xmath42 , i.e. , the potential is given by the relation such that @xmath53 is constant , the nucleation probability does not change .",
    "hence whether the universe with a different gravitational constant is plausible or not depends on the choice of the potential form .",
    "the power spectrum of curvature perturbations which reenter inside the horizon of our bubble universe is evaluated by considering both reflected @xmath54 and transmitted @xmath55 waves .",
    "the modulation factor of a normalised power spectrum of curvature perturbations ( [ eq : def - dimpower])-([eq : s2 ] ) is affected by changing @xmath40 . in what follows",
    ", we assume @xmath36 just for simplicity , and then compare the case of @xmath33 with that of @xmath35 . if the surface density takes the value @xmath56 for @xmath33 , we find @xmath57 for @xmath35 .",
    "the gravitational constant @xmath58 for @xmath35 of the exterior of the bubble takes smaller value than the case of @xmath33 by the factor @xmath59 because @xmath60 becomes three halves ( see fig.[fig : g - b120 ] ) .    for small value of @xmath7 ,",
    "which we assume through this paper , which have been obtained as ( [ eq : modulation - super])-([eq : s2 ] ) , we plot the effect of difference of gravitational constants on the power spectrum in fig.[fig : g - b12 ] .",
    "the modulation factor ( @xmath61 ) , which describes a correction from a standard scale - invariant spectrum , shows oscillatory bumps at a small scale @xmath62 and its amplitude increases for smaller @xmath63 .",
    "it also increases for a smaller value of the parameter @xmath42 . by using ( [ eq : s2 ] )",
    ", the term such as @xmath64 gives the oscillation period @xmath65 for small @xmath42 .",
    "therefore when @xmath31 becomes a half , the period @xmath66 becomes more sharp by twice .",
    "we conclude the effect of different gravitational constant on the final power spectrum as follows .",
    "the typical signature appears on a small scale and it gives an increasing oscillation .",
    "especially , if the gravitational constants for both sides of the wall is close to each other , i.e. , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , the modulation of power spectrum becomes larger .",
    "the feature where an increasing oscillation appears on small scale is generated by the transmitted @xmath55 wave of perturbation in the exterior bubble universe ( see ( [ eq : til - alpha - e ] ) ) , and can be constrained by the observation of cmb .     and @xmath57.,width=264 ]",
    "we have argued a possible scenario that each universe takes its own different value of gravitational constant in the context of the emergence of the bubble universes . in order to construct a model that makes different gravitational constants corresponding to several vacua",
    ", we adopt the jbd theory , with which taking different values of the vev of the jbd scalar field , the universes with different gravitational constants are achieved .",
    "in particular , we investigate the effect of different gravitational constant in the exterior universe on primordial curvature perturbations observed in the interior bubble universe .    via a conformal transformation",
    ", we can simply analyze the physics in the einstein frame , that is the nucleation of bubbles , the evolution of bubble wall and matching curvature perturbations of the interior and exterior region . in the jordan frame ,",
    "it becomes clear that the final power spectrum of curvature perturbation is affected by the bubble boundary through the surface energy density @xmath42 of the wall .",
    "the key parameter is @xmath31 , which is @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the vev s of the jbd scalar field in the interior and exterior universes .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is related to the ratio of gravitational constants as @xmath71 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : modulation - power ] , for different values of @xmath42 , we show the modulation of the power spectrum , which has several peaks with growing oscillation in fourier space .",
    "if the gravitational constant in the exterior universe gets smaller , @xmath31 or @xmath42 increases and then the modulation becomes smaller .",
    "choosing a smaller parameter @xmath42 will heighten the amplitude of peak shown in the modulation of power spectrum of curvature perturbations .    in our result",
    ", we assume that the @xmath16-foldings of inflationary period is about @xmath72 , because the initial modulation of perturbations will not be observed for inflationary models with the @xmath16-foldings more than @xmath72 . in this paper , we have not discussed after inflation .",
    "the result obtained from perturbations matching at later time such as a radiation dominated era will be more interesting and important , although it is difficult to describe a trajectory of the bubble wall in an analytic form . in order to solve dynamics of wall in this phase , we may need numerical treatment . along this direction",
    ", we hope to make a progress in our future work .",
