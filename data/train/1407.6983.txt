    "tidal coupling in binary inspiral has been a topic of much recent interest . a great deal of attention",
    "has focused in particular on systems which contain neutron stars , where tides and their backreaction on the binary s evolution may allow a new probe of the equation of state of neutron star matter @xcite .",
    "a great deal of work has been done to rigorously define the distortion of fluid stars @xcite , the coupling of the tidal distortion to the binary s orbital energy and angular momentum @xcite , and most recently the importance of nonlinear fluid modes which can be sourced by tidal fields @xcite .",
    "tidal coupling also plays a role in the evolution of binary black holes .",
    "indeed , the influence of tidal coupling on binary black holes has been studied in some detail over the past two decades , but using rather different language : instead of `` tidal coupling , '' past literature typically discusses gravitational radiation `` down the horizon . ''",
    "this down - horizon radiation has a dual description in the tidal deformation of the black hole s event horizon .",
    "a major purpose of this paper is to explore this dual description , examining quantitatively how a black hole is deformed by an orbiting companion .",
    "consider the down - horizon radiation picture first .",
    "the wave equation governing radiation produced in a black hole spacetime admits two solutions @xcite , one describing outgoing radiation very far from the hole , and another describing radiation ingoing on the event horizon .",
    "both solutions carry energy and angular momentum away from the binary , and drive ( on average ) a secular inspiral of the orbit . after suitable averaging ,",
    "we require ( for example ) the orbital energy @xmath2 to evolve according to @xmath3 where @xmath4 describes energy carried far away by the waves , and @xmath5 describes energy carried into the event horizon .",
    "the down - horizon flux has an interesting property . when it is computed for a small body that is in a circular , equatorial orbit of a kerr black hole with mass @xmath6 and spin parameter @xmath7 , we find that @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the orbital frequency . ] , and @xmath10 is the hole s spin frequency ( ref .",
    "@xcite , sec viid ; see also synopsis in sec .",
    "[ sec : downhoriz ] ) .",
    "the radius @xmath11 gives the location of the event horizon in boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "we assume that the orbit is prograde , so that the orbital angular momentum is parallel to the hole s spin angular momentum .    when @xmath12 ( i.e. , when the orbit rotates faster than the black hole spins ) , we have @xmath13",
    " radiation carries energy into the horizon , taking it from the orbital energy .",
    "this is intuitively sensible , given that an event horizon generally acts as a sink for energy and matter .",
    "however , when @xmath14 ( the hole spins faster than the orbit s rotation ) , we have @xmath15 .",
    "this means that the down - horizon component of the radiation _ augments _ the orbital energy  energy is transferred from the hole to the orbit .",
    "this is far more difficult to reconcile with the behavior of an event horizon .",
    "one clue to understanding this behavior is that , when @xmath16 , the modes which contribute to the radiation are _ superradiant _ @xcite .",
    "consider a plane wave which propagates toward the black hole .",
    "a portion of the wave is absorbed by the black hole ( changing its mass and spin ) , and a portion is scattered back out to large radius . a superradiant mode ( see , for example , sec .  98 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is one in which the scattered wave has higher amplitude than the original ingoing wave .",
    "some of the black hole s spin angular momentum and rotational energy has been transferred to the radiation .",
    "although the condition for superradiance is the same as the condition under which an orbit gains energy from the black hole , superradiance does not explain how energy is transferred from the hole to the orbit .",
    "a more satisfying picture of this can be built by invoking the dual picture of a tidal distortion .",
    "as originally shown by hartle @xcite , an event horizon s intrinsic curvature is distorted by a tidal perturbation . in analogy with tidal coupling in fluid systems ,",
    "the tidally distorted horizon can gravitationally couple to the orbiting body , transfering energy and angular momentum from the black hole to the orbit .",
    "let us examine the fluid analogy in more detail for a moment .",
    "consider in particular a moon that raises a tide on a fluid body , distorting its shape from spherical to a prolate ellipsoid .",
    "the tidal response will produce a bulge that tends to point at the moon .",
    "due to the fluid s viscosity , the bulging response will lag the driving tidal force . as a consequence ,",
    "if the moon s orbit is faster than the body s spin , then the bulge will lag behind .",
    "the bulge will exert a torque on the orbit that tends to slow down the orbit ; the orbit exerts a torque that tends to speed up the body s spin .",
    "conversely , if the spin is faster than the orbit , the bulge will lead the moon s position , and the torque upon the orbit will tend to speed it up ( and torque from the orbit tends to slow down the spin ) . in both cases ,",
    "the bulge and moon exert torques on one another in such a way that the spin and orbit frequencies tend to be equalized .",
    "the action of this torque is such that energy is taken out of the moon s orbit if the orbit frequency is larger than the spin frequency , and vice versa .",
    "since a black hole s shape is changed by tidal forces in a manner similar to the change in shape of a fluid body , one can imagine that the horizon s tidal bulge likewise exerts a torque on an orbit .",
    "examining eq .",
    "( [ eq : horizonflux_prop ] ) , we see that the sign of the `` horizon flux '' energy loss is exactly in accord with the tidal fluid analogy  energy is lost from the orbit if the orbital frequency exceeds the black hole s spin frequency , and vice versa . using the membrane paradigm @xcite",
    ", one can assign a viscosity to the horizon , making the fluid analogy even more compelling .    however , as was first noted by hartle @xcite , the geometry of a black hole s tidal bulge behaves in a rather counterintuitive manner . at least using a weak - field , slow spin analysis",
    ", the bulge _ leads _ the orbit when @xmath12 , and _ lags _ when @xmath14 .",
    "this is opposite to the geometry which the fluid analogy would lead us to expect .",
    "this is because an event horizon is a teleological object : whether an event in spacetime is inside or outside a horizon depends on that event s null future . at some moment in a given time",
    "slicing , an event horizon arranges itself in anticipation of the gravitational stresses it will be feeling in the future .",
    "this is closely related to the manner in which the event horizon of a spherical black hole expands outward when a spherical shell falls into it .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite , sec .",
    "vic6 for further discussion .",
    "much of this background has been extensively discussed in past literature @xcite .",
    "recent work on this problem has examined in detail how one can quantify the tidal distortion of a black hole , demonstrating that the `` gravitational love numbers '' which characterize the distortion of fluid bodies vanish for non - rotating black holes @xcite , but that the geometry s distortion can nonetheless be quantified assuming particularly useful coordinate systems @xcite and in a fully covariant manner @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can define `` surficial love numbers , '' which quantify the distortion of a body s surface , for schwarzschild black holes @xcite .",
    "these techniques have been used to study horizon distortion in the schwarzschild and slow spin limits , and for slow orbital velocities @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to develop tools to explore the distorted geometry of a black hole in a binary which are good for fast motion , strong field orbits .",
    "we use techniques originally developed by hartle @xcite to compute the ricci scalar curvature @xmath17 associated with the 2-surface of the distorted horizon ; this is closely related to the intrinsic horizon metric developed in ref .",
    "we will restrict our binaries to large mass ratios in order to use the tools of black hole perturbation theory .",
    "we also develop tools to embed the horizon in a 3-dimensional space in order to visualize the tidal distortions . in this paper , we restrict our embeddings to black hole spins @xmath0 .",
    "this is the largest spin at which the horizon can be embedded in a global euclidean space ; black holes with spins in the range @xmath18 must either be embedded in a space that is partially euclidean , partially lorentzian @xcite , or be embedded in another space altogether @xcite .",
    "although no issue of principle prevents us for examining larger spins , it does not add very much to the physics we wish to study here , so we defer embeddings for @xmath1 to a later paper .    a secondary goal of this paper is to investigate whether there is a simple connection between the geometry of the tidal bulge and the orbit s evolution .",
    "in particular , we wish to see if the sign of @xmath19 , which is determined by @xmath20 , is connected to the bulge s geometry relative to the orbit .",
    "this turns out to be somewhat tricky to investigate .",
    "the orbit and the horizon are at different locations , so we must map the orbit s position onto the horizon .",
    "there is no unique way to do this , so the results depend at least in part on how we make the map .",
    "we present two maps from orbit to horizon .",
    "one , based on ingoing zero - angular momentum light rays , is useful for comparing with past literature .",
    "the other , based on the geometry of the horizon s embedding and the orbit at an instant of constant ingoing time , is useful for describing our numerical data ( at least for small spin ) . another way to characterize",
    "the bulge geometry is to examine the relative phase of the bulge s curvature to the tidal field which distorts the black hole .",
    "both of these quantities are defined at @xmath21 , so no mapping is necessary .",
    "we find that , at the extremes , the response of a black hole to a perturbing tide follows newtonian logic ( modulo a swap of `` lag '' and `` lead , '' thanks to the horizon s teleological nature ) . in particular , when @xmath22 ( so that @xmath23 ) , the bulge leads the orbit , no matter how we compare the bulge to the orbit .",
    "when @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , the bulge lags the orbit .",
    "however , relations between lag , lead , and @xmath19 are not so clear cut when @xmath26 .",
    "consider , in particular the case @xmath27 , for which @xmath28 .",
    "for newtonian , fluid bodies , the tidal bulge points directly at the orbiting body in this case , with no exchange of torque between the body and the orbit . for black holes",
    ", we find no particular relation between the horizon s bulge and the orbit s position .",
    "the relation between tidal coupling and tidal distortion is far more complicated in black hole systems than it is for fluid bodies in newtonian gravity  which is not especially surprising .",
    "soon after we submitted this paper and posted a preprint to the arxiv , cabero and krishnan posted an analysis of tidally deformed spinning black holes @xcite .",
    "although their techniques and analysis differ quite a bit from ours ( focusing on the bowen - york @xcite initial data set , and using the framework of isolated horizons ) , their results seem broadly consistent with ours",
    ". it may be useful in future work to explore this apparent consistency more closely , and to borrow some of the tools that they have developed for the systems that we analyze here .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our formalism for computing the geometry of distorted kerr black holes is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] .",
    "we show how to compute the curvature of a tidally distorted black hole , and how to quantify the relation of the geometry of this distortion to the geometry of the orbit which produces the tidal field .",

    "sections [ sec : schw_results ] and [ sec : kerr_results ] present results for schwarzschild and kerr , respectively . in both sections ,",
    "we first look at the black hole s curvature in a slow motion , slow spin expansion ( slow motion only for schwarzschild ) .",
    "this allows us to develop analytic expressions for the curvature , which are useful for comparing to the fast motion , rapid spin numerical results that we then compute .",

    "we do not use this notion of bulge phase very much in this analysis , but anticipate using it in future work which will examine more complicated cases than the circular , equatorial orbits that are our focus here .      in his original examination of black hole tidal distortion ,",
    "hartle @xcite connects the orbit to the horizon with a zero angular momentum ingoing light ray . choosing our origins appropriately , the orbiting body is at angle @xmath213 in boyer - lindquist coordinates .",

    "this choice is useful for making figures that show both bulge and orbit , since we simply show their locations at a given moment @xmath212 .",
    "this mapping neglects the term @xmath220 , but is otherwise identical to the null map : @xmath229 the offset of the orbit and bulge in this mapping is @xmath230 since @xmath231 for @xmath48 , the null and instantaneous maps are identical for schwarzschild black holes .    before concluding our discussion of the tidal bulge phase , we emphasize again that the phase in both the null map and the instantaneous map follow from arbitrary choices , and must be interpreted in the context of those choices .",
    "other choices could be made .",
    "for example , one could make a map that is instantaneous in a different time coordinate , or that is based on a different family of ingoing light rays ( e.g. , the principle ingoing null congruence , along which @xmath212 , @xmath232 , and @xmath83 are constant ; such a map would be identical to the instantaneous map ) .",

    "we include it because we expect similar horizon distortions for very strong field orbits of black holes with @xmath1 , and that such a horizon geometry will be produced transiently from the closest approach of eccentric orbits around black holes with @xmath479 .",
    "both of these cases will be investigated more thoroughly in later papers .",
    "we showed in sec .  [ sec : downhoriz ] that the orbital energy evolves due to horizon coupling according to @xmath480 .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , it is simple to build an intuitive picture of this in newtonian physics . for a newtonian tide acting on a fluid body , when @xmath481 tidal forces raise a bulge on the body which leads the orbit s position .",
    "this bulge exerts a torque which transfers energy from the body s spin to the orbit .",
    "when @xmath482 , the bulge lags the orbit , and the torque transfers energy from the orbit to the body s spin . when @xmath284 , @xmath28 .",
    "the newtonian fluid expectation is thus that there should be no offset between the bulge and the orbit .",
    "the tidal bulge should point directly at the orbiting body , locking the body s tide to the orbit .",
    "consider now a fully relativistic calculation of tides acting on a black hole .",
    "when @xmath22 ( e.g. , the schwarzschild limit ) and @xmath483 ( large radius orbits of kerr black holes ) , the newtonian fluid intuition is consistent with our results , modulo the switch of `` lead '' and `` lag '' thanks to the teleological nature of the event horizon .",
    "however , it is not so clear if this intuition holds up when @xmath484 and @xmath418 are comparable in magnitude .",

    "( a second root exists at @xmath496 , but this is inside the photon orbit . ) using the instantaneous map changes the numbers , but not the punchline : for @xmath475 , the root moves to @xmath497 , with @xmath498 . changing the spin changes the numbers , but leaves the message the same : zero offset in these maps does not correspond to @xmath499 .    equations ( [ eq : nmoffsetzero ] ) and ( [ eq : imoffsetzero ] ) were derived using a small spin expansion . before drawing too firm a conclusion from this , let us examine the situation using numerical data good for large spin . in fig .",

    "the orbit leads the bulge .",
    "as the black hole s spin increases , the lead becomes a lag .",
    "this lead gets smaller as the spin gets larger . since the lag becomes a lead as the spin",
    "is changed from @xmath500 to @xmath501 , there must be a spin value between @xmath502 and @xmath501 for which the lead angle is zero for the corotating orbit .",
    "our data also suggest that the lead angle may approach zero as the spin gets very large . but",
    "this suggests that the horizon locks to the orbit for at most only two spin values , in this map  a set of measure zero . we do not find any systematic connection between the geometry and the horizon for these orbits .    before concluding ,",
    "let us examine the relative phase of the tidal field and the horizon s curvature , eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltatb ] ) . setting @xmath503 yields",
    "@xmath504 we again see @xmath505 when the field and the response are aligned ( although @xmath506 as @xmath81 gets very large ) .",
    "the analytical expansions and numerical data indicate that the newtonian fluid intuition for the geometry of tidal coupling simply does not work well for strong - field black hole binaries , even accounting for the teleological swap of `` lag '' and `` lead . '' only in the extremes can we make statements with confidence : when @xmath507 , the tidal bulge will lag the orbit ; when @xmath22 , the bulge will lead the orbit .",
    "but when @xmath484 and @xmath418 are of similar magnitude , we can not make a clean prediction .",
    "the tidal bulge is _ not _ locked to the orbit when @xmath508 , at least using any scheme to define the lead / lag angle that we have examined .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a formalism for computing tidal distortions of kerr black holes .",
    "using black hole perturbation theory , our approach is good for fast motion , strong field orbits , and can be applied to a black hole of any spin parameter .",
    "we have also developed tools for visualizing the distorted horizon by embedding its 2-dimensional surface in a 3-dimensional euclidean space . for now , our embeddings are only good for kerr spin parameter @xmath509 , the highest value for which the entire horizon can be embedded in a globally euclidean space .",
    "higher spins require either a piecewise embedding of an equatorial `` belt '' in a euclidean space , and a region near the `` poles '' in a lorentzian space , or else embedding in a different space altogether .",
    "although our formalism is good for arbitrary bound orbits , we have focused on circular and equatorial orbits for this first analysis .",
    "this allowed us to validate this formalism against existing results in the literature , and to explore whether there is a simple connection between the tidal coupling of the hole to the orbit , and the relative geometry of the orbit and the horizon s tidal bulge .",
    "we find that there is no such simple connection in general .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , strong - field black hole systems are more complicated than newtonian fluid bodies .",
    "we plan two followup analyses to extend the work we have done here .",
    "first , we plan to extend the work on embedding horizons to @xmath1 , the domain for which we can not use a globally euclidean embedding .",
    "work in progress indicates that the simplest and perhaps most useful approach is to use the globally hyperbolic 3-space @xmath510 @xcite .",
    "this allows us to treat the entire range of physical black hole spins , @xmath511 , using a single global embedding space .",
    "second , we plan to examine tidal distortions from generic  inclined and eccentric  kerr orbits .",
    "the circular equatorial orbits we have studied in this first paper are stationary , as are the tidal fields and tidal responses that arise from them .",
    "if one examines the system and the horizon s response in a frame that corotates with the orbit , the tide and the horizon will appear static .",
    "this will not be the case for generic orbits . even when viewed in a frame that rotates at the orbit s",
    "mean @xmath512 frequency , the orbit will be dynamical , and so the horizon s response will likewise be dynamical .",
    "similar analyses for schwarzschild have already been presented by vega , poisson , and massey @xcite ; it will be interesting to compare with the more complicated and less symmetric kerr case .",
    "an extension of our analysis may be useful for improving initial data for numerical relativity simulations of merging binary black holes .",
    "one source of error in such simulations is that the black holes typically have the wrong initial geometry  unless the binary is extremely widely separated , we expect each hole to be distorted by their companion s tides . accounting for this in the initial data requires matching the near - horizon geometry to the binary s spacetime metric ; see @xcite for an up - to - date discussion of work to include tidal effects in a binary s initial data .",
    "much work has been done on binaries containing tidally deformed schwarzschild black holes @xcite , and efforts now focus on the more realistic case of binaries containing spinning black holes @xcite . with some effort ( in order to get the geometry in a region near the horizon , not just on the horizon ) , we believe it should be possible to use this work as an additional tool for extending the matching procedure to the realistic orbital geometries of rotating black holes .    we thank eric poisson for useful discussions and comments , as well as feedback on an early draft - in - progress on this paper ; robert penna for helpful comments and discussion , particularly regarding non - euclidean horizon embeddings ; nicols yunes for suggesting that this technique might usefully connect to initial data for binary black holes ; daniel kennefick for helpful discussions as this project was originally being formulated ; and this paper s referee for very helpful comments and feedback . this work was supported by nsf grant phy-1068720 .",
