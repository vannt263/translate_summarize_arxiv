    "the population of galaxies in the local universe presents a clear bi - modality , as evidenced by color - magnitude diagrams ( e.g @xcite ) , with galaxies either living on the red sequence or in the blue cloud .",
    "this bi - modality is further supported by tight correlations between the main physical properties of each class ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies on the red sequence typically are massive and quiescent ( i.e. with low or no ongoing star formation ) with early - type morphologies , while galaxies in the blue cloud are less massive , with higher star formation rates ( sfrs ) and have spiral or irregular morphologies .",
    "the physical mechanisms driving the onset of the observed bi - modality are one of the main open issues in the study of galaxy formation . at high redshift",
    "the observational picture is complicated by the lack of a common definition for massive , quiescent galaxies ( mqgs ) in the literature ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "samples selected according to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) show that massive ( i.e. stellar mass @xmath13 ) and quiescent ( i.e. specific star formation rate ssfr @xmath14yr@xmath15 ) galaxies were already in place at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "their number density has grown by almost a factor of 10 since @xmath16 @xcite , although most of the evolution occurred at @xmath17 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to rapid number density evolution , the sizes of mqgs have evolved dramatically from high redshift to the present day .",
    "most of mqgs at @xmath18 are also compact systems : the observed effective radii are generally a factor of @xmath19 smaller at @xmath20 @xcite than at @xmath21 , where such compact galaxies are almost entirely absent @xcite",
    ".    there have been multiple attempts to explain the evolution of these objects and to place them into a broader cosmological context . in the so - called monolithic collapse scenario ,",
    "mqgs would have assembled almost all of their stellar mass at high redshift , followed by a passive evolution of the stellar population .",
    "this class of models , however , foresees little or no evolution in size , in contrast to observations .",
    "more recent models describe the formation of mqgs as a two - stage process : gas - rich merger events generate compact , massive spheroids at @xmath22 , while minor , dry ( i.e. without formation of new stars ) mergers at later cosmic times would increase the size , while responsible for only a small increase in stellar mass @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that the stellar mass density of the inner @xmath6kpc of @xmath3 galaxies does not substantially differ from that in present - day mqgs , suggesting that the growth during the second phase progresses from the inner region rapidly towards the external parts ( the so - called inside - out growth - see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the picture is still far from being completely clear : detailed comparisons with @xmath23cdm models of dry merging show that some of the models predict descendants of @xmath24 too compact compared to the observed local mqgs @xcite .",
    "recent studies have also revealed the existence of a large number of mqgs at @xmath25 with sizes similar to those of the local galaxies with comparable mass @xcite .",
    "if the population of mqgs at @xmath26 includes only compact systems , this would imply a size evolution timescale of @xmath27 gyr , challenging the current models of formation of local mqgs @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this work is to identify , within an observational framework , the population of galaxies at @xmath2 which could give rise to the population of compact , mqgs observed at @xmath28 .",
    "we combine data from two public surveys , the newfirm medium - band survey ( nmbs , @xcite ) and the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels , @xcite ) .",
    "the nmbs provides accurate measurements of photometric redshifts ( @xmath29 ) , stellar masses ( @xmath30 ) and star - formation rates ( sfr ) , while robust morphologies and sizes were measured from the high - resolution imaging from candels .    in section [ sec : data",
    "] , we describe the data sets used in our work , the measurements of the sizes , and the completeness in stellar mass .",
    "the results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we discuss our results in section [ sec : learn ] , and summarize them in section 5 .    throughout this work ,",
    "we use a concordance cosmology with @xmath31 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "all magnitudes are referred to the ab system .",
    "we combined the photometric depth and the accurate measurements of photometric redshifts offered by the nmbs ( @xcite ) with the high - resolution hst / wfc3 deep nir imaging from the candels ( @xcite ) .",
    "these two surveys will be briefly described in the next two sections .",
    "the nmbs covers two fields : a @xmath34 \" pointing within the cosmos field @xcite and a second pointing , of the same size , overlapping with part of the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ) strip @xcite .",
    "only the data from the cosmos field was used , since the overlap between nmbs - aegis and candels is minimal ; using both fields the average improvement in cosmic variance would have been just 5% .",
    "nmbs uses five medium - bandwidth filters in the nir wavelength range @xmath35 m .",
    "the bluest filter is similar to the y band , the canonical j and h bands are split into two filters each .",
    "such configuration pinpoints the location of the redshifted balmer/@xmath36  breaks in @xmath37 galaxies @xcite and enables photometric redshift measurements with an accuracy of @xmath38 for objects in the redshift range @xmath37 @xcite .    the full public catalog for the cosmos field @xcite provides uv - to-24  @xmath39 m photometry for 31306 k - selected sources based on the de - blended version , along with accurate photometric redshifts , rest - frame luminosities , star formation rates , and stellar mass measurements .",
    "the redshifts and stellar masses were computed using 37 filters from the cosmos fields , combining the nir medium - bandwidth data with existing uv ( galaxy evolution explorer ) , visible and nir ( canada - france - hawaii telescope and subaru telescope ) , and mid - ir ( spitzer / irac ) imaging @xcite .",
    "the catalog is complete at the 75% detection level for magnitudes brighter than @xmath40ab @xcite ; we selected objects brighter than @xmath41 mag , corresponding to a detection completeness of 50% .",
    "candels is a 902-orbit hubble space telescope ( hst ) multi - cycle treasury program aimed at probing the evolution of galaxies and black holes from @xmath42 to 8 and at detecting and studying type ia supernovae at @xmath43 in order to better constrain the nature of dark energy @xcite .",
    "the wide portion of the survey covers a total of @xmath44 square arcminutes down to @xmath45 mag , spread over five fields : extended regions around the two goods fields , the extended groth strip ( egs : @xcite ) , cosmos @xcite , and the ukidss ultra - deep survey ( uds : @xcite ) .",
    "we used the f160w as the filter for the measurement of the morphological parameters as it is the reddest band available with high - resolution imaging . at redshift @xmath46",
    ", the f160w filter corresponds to the rest - frame b - band .",
    "+      the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the point - spread function ( psf ) on the candels f160w images is fwhm@xmath47 @xcite , a factor of @xmath486 better than the @xmath49-band psf in nmbs .",
    "this fact , together with the higher photometric depth compared to the nmbs survey , translates into a higher surface brightness sensitivity than nmbs .    from the full nmbs catalog we extracted those non - stellar objects and objects with a good quality flag ( _ star_flag=0 _ and _ use=1 _ ) .",
    "we selected galaxies compatible with being at @xmath2 at the 1-sigma level ( i.e. _ u_68 _ @xmath50 ) . in this way , we selected a total of 613 galaxies .",
    "the overlap of the candels cosmos image and the nmbs cosmos field amounts to 192 square arcmin , @xmath51 of the original nmbs field .",
    "this reduces the sample of @xmath2 galaxies available to the measurement of the morphological parameters to 133 sources",
    ".    the availability of candels data allowed us to accurately measure the morphological parameters of our @xmath2 galaxies , and to identify potentially blended objects , which appear as single sources in the nmbs catalog . in figure",
    "[ fig : deblending ] we show an example of the importance of high - resolution imaging , which allowed us to identify those cases in which blended and/or very close objects could affect the measurement of the sed , with consequently unreliable photometric redshifts and stellar population properties ( e.g. stellar masses , sfrs ) . for these reasons ,",
    "blended objects were excluded from our final analysis .",
    "we also visually inspected the 133 seds of the @xmath2 galaxies and excluded from the sample those showing the presence of a possible agn ( an example of which is presented in figure [ fig : agn ] ) .",
    "the fraction of such objects in the whole sample of 133 galaxies summed to 4% .",
    "the final catalog includes 110 galaxies .",
    "the distribution of @xmath30 with @xmath29 for the final sample is presented in figure [ fig : m_star - z ] .",
    "the median redshift and redshift uncertainty for the full sample are @xmath52 and 0.1 respectively ; similarly , for the @xmath53 subsample , we have @xmath54 .",
    "the plot shows also that out of the 10 objects with redshift compatible with @xmath55 , none of them has a stellar mass @xmath53 , increasing our confidence in the adopted redshift selection criteria .",
    "galaxies is 3.2 , and it is marked by the vertical dashed line .",
    "all @xmath56 galaxies , selected to possibly lie at @xmath2 , have a redshift @xmath57 at a 68% confidence level .",
    "this gives us confidence that our selection is not including @xmath3 galaxies with very broad redshift probability distributions.[fig : m_star - z],width=347 ]    the luminosity profile of each galaxy was fit by a single @xcite profile , using the galfit @xcite program .",
    "this code fits two - dimensional analytic functions directly to images after convolving the profile with a psf .",
    "all size measurements were done on the f160w candels image .    .",
    "associated errors on @xmath58 are from galfit .",
    "points are color - coded according to their stellar mass .",
    "the sample defined by @xmath59 and marked in the plot by the large red filled squares , is complete in stellar mass at the 70% level . as such ,",
    "this is the sample we adopt to draw our conclusions .",
    "the vertical grey region marks the limit to which we can resolve objects , determined by fitting stars with a @xcite profile .",
    "we note that , given the existence of a size - mass relation , the vertical line at @xmath60  kpc marking the separation between compact and extended galaxies only applies to @xmath59 galaxies ( see section [ sect : cmsf ] for a more complete discussion ) .",
    "the inset shows the cumulative fraction of galaxies according to their effective radius @xmath58 for the full sample ( solid black line ) , for the massive ( @xmath59 ) galaxies ( dotted red line ) and for the compact ( @xmath61  kpc ) , massive , quiescent ( @xmath62 ) sample ( dashed purple line ) .",
    "a vertical grey line marks our limit in @xmath58 for the compact galaxies .",
    "approximately 70% of the galaxies in our ( flux - limited ) sample have @xmath61  kpc ; 4 out of the 10 massive galaxies are also compact .",
    "no extended quiescent galaxies are present , although this could be the result of a surface brightness effect .",
    "star - forming galaxies show no evident correlation between @xmath58 and ssfr .",
    "[ fig : re - ssfr],width=347 ]    a zero - order set of morphological parameters was obtained via sextractor @xcite on the f160w image . in order to make the measurements of the morphological parameters with galfit as robust and reliable as possible ,",
    "two fundamental steps were taken into account .",
    "the first is the construction of the psf , while the second is the evaluation of the sky background level .",
    "the psf was constructed with iraf / daophot @xcite , from a set of unsaturated , bright and isolated stars , and using a gaussian analytic function plus a look - up table built by the iraf ` psf ` task from the residuals of the function fitting .",
    "this allowed us to take into account the anisotropies of the brightness profile , especially those in the wings of the psf .",
    "the sextractor sky measurement is based on thresholding : the sky is measured by determining when the gradient of the flux flattens out enough compared to the background noise .",
    "in particular this means that sextractor will generally over - predict the sky with the effect of suppressing the srsic index , the effective radius , and luminosity . in our analysis",
    ", the background level was estimated from its median value in 30 non - overlapping boxes 50 pixels ( 3 `` ) wide , distributed across a region of 400 pixels ( 24 '' ) around the central object and free from any other source , as probed by the sextractor segmentation map .",
    "the region size is wide enough to grant robust statistics and at the same time it is small enough to mitigate possible gradients in the sky background .",
    "the boxes were kept to an additional distance of 0.6 \" from the segmentation map , increasing the confidence in excluding contamination from the outskirts of objects .",
    "all objects in a box of 150 pixels ( 9 \" ) around each galaxy were simultaneously fit , in order to take into account possible contamination of the brightness profile from neighboring objects , which could bias the measured size and srsic index .",
    "the effective radii were finally circularized and converted to physical units using the adopted cosmology .",
    "the resulting distribution of @xmath58 as a function of the ssfr for the galaxies of our sample are presented in figure [ fig : re - ssfr ] .",
    "consistent statistical measurements of intrinsic physical quantities rely on the accurate characterization of the selection effects , i.e. on the completeness of the sample .    the galaxy stellar mass completeness for a flux - limited sample not only directly depends on the limiting flux itself , but also on the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath63 ) of each galaxy .",
    "all else being the same , galaxies with lower @xmath63 values will be probed to lower mass limits ; similarly , it is possible to probe only the higher stellar mass region for those object with higher @xmath63 ratios ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the above effect makes the measurement of the stellar - mass completeness a non trivial task ; common approaches involve either ssp modelling @xcite and/or comparing the galaxy populations to existing deeper data @xcite .    .",
    "points are color - coded according to their stellar mass .",
    "objects covered by the candels f160w frame which allowed for size measurement are marked by larger symbols , with the symbol size proportional to the @xmath58 .",
    "the 50% completeness level , computed adopting the @xmath49-band detection completeness curve from @xcite , is marked by the yellow dashed curve , while the 80% completeness level by the cyan dash - dotted curve .",
    "the vertical arrow marks the @xmath63 of a single stellar population passively evolved to @xmath64 , smaller than the maximum value we observe for the massive population , increasing our confidence on our completeness analysis .",
    "the completeness of the @xmath56 galaxies is @xmath65 .",
    "[ fig : compl],width=347 ]    the average psf on nmbs frames is @xmath66 , corresponding to an @xmath58 of @xmath67 , or @xmath485  kpc at @xmath64 . in particular",
    "this means that objects with @xmath68  kpc are essentially point sources on the nmbs frames .",
    "the inset in figure  [ fig : re - ssfr ] shows that the totality of the galaxies in our sample has @xmath68  kpc .",
    "we therefore adopt , for each galaxy , the @xmath69band completeness curve measured for point sources for the nmbs survey and presented in @xcite .",
    "the completeness of the @xmath2 sample as a function of stellar mass was analyzed for different ranges in @xmath63 ratio .",
    "objects with @xmath59 are complete at the @xmath70 level .",
    "a graphical representation is plotted in figure [ fig : compl ] , which shows the @xmath71 vs. @xmath63 ratio diagram for all nmbs galaxies at @xmath2 , as well as the 50% and 80% completeness curves of the stellar mass as a function of @xmath63 ratio derived from the @xmath49-band detection completeness curve from @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : compl ] shows that for galaxies with @xmath72 , the completeness is @xmath73 . also plotted is the @xmath63 at @xmath64 of a passively evolving single stellar population formed at @xmath74 .",
    "its value , equal to @xmath75 , well below the maximum value we observe for the massive sample , provides additional confidence in the adopted completeness limits in stellar mass .",
    "we note furthermore that the completeness in stellar mass as a function of redshift is fairly flat over the redshift range targeted in our work , changing by , e.g. , @xmath76  dex from @xmath77 to @xmath16 for a single stellar population formed at @xmath78 . in our analysis",
    "we then selected only those galaxies with @xmath79 ( for a total of 10 objects ) , for which small completeness corrections are required ; specifically , the correction for incompleteness ranged from 1.05 to 1.5 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in the following section , we present the number densities of massive , quiescent galaxies ; the number densities of the compact , massive , quiescent population is discussed in section [ sec : cmq ] . as a further and more consistent source of comparison ,",
    "the number density of @xmath2 massive galaxies and of @xmath28 massive , quiescent galaxies was also computed using the full nmbs catalog .",
    "these two populations were selected according to the same limits in stellar mass and sfr used for the other samples , i.e. @xmath59 and @xmath80(ssfr / yr@xmath15)@xmath81 . the full list of the number densities computed for the different choices of sfh can be found in table [ tab : numden ] .",
    "the co - moving volume was computed assuming a redshift range @xmath82 .",
    "we used upper and lower error bars from @xcite and added in quadrature the cosmic variance .",
    "figure [ fig : m_star - z ] shows that there are 6 objects with @xmath83 , although all of them have stellar masses @xmath84 .",

    "specifically , for the exponential and truncated exponential sfh , we used stellar masses and sfrs computed adopting an exponential sfr and a @xcite imf , and converting the sfrs and stellar masses to a kroupa imf by subtracting 0.2 dex .",
    "the location of the starting galaxies does not depend much on the sfh used to compute the stellar masses and sfrs , meaning that the choice of sfh primarily effects the evolved galaxies .",
    "the number density @xmath102 of massive ( @xmath103 ) @xmath2 galaxies from our sample is @xmath104  mpc@xmath87 ; figure [ fig : numden ] shows that it is fully compatible with the number density of @xmath105 quiescent galaxies from @xcite .",
    "in particular , this implies that the whole population of massive @xmath2 galaxies needs to have its sfr quenched to @xmath62 by @xmath3 .",
    "the comparison of the number density of @xmath2 massive galaxies with @xmath28 massive , quiescent galaxies , both computed using the full nmbs catalog , confirms the above result .",
    "this is further supported by our sfh predictions .",
    "the blue bar in the left panel of figure [ fig : numden ] represents the number density of galaxies which , evolved from their observed redshifts , are massive and quiescent by @xmath28 .",
    "the box takes into account the spread in values from 4 of the 5 adopted sfhs ( excluding the csf ) , and cosmic variance .",
    "the blue box is in good agreement with measurements of quiescent galaxies from @xcite at @xmath106 .",
    "over - plotted are also the values from the individual sfhs . in general , apart from the constant sfh case , it is not possible to discriminate amongst the sfhs , mainly due to the high cosmic variance errors ( @xmath107 relative error ) . as shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : numden ] ,",
    "4 out of 5 of the sfhs do equally well in reproducing the number counts of mqgs at @xmath55 .",
    "the only exception is the csf that underpredicts the observed number density of mqgs at @xmath3 by a factor of @xmath108 .",
    "this suggests that the only valid sfhs are the declining or truncated sfhs and that the constant sfh is not a valid option in this range of redshift . on the other side ,",
    "given that the number densities of massive , star - forming galaxies at @xmath3 is approximately the same as that of mqgs @xcite , the fact that the csf sfh underpredicts the number densities of mqg means that the csf sfh would underpredict also the number density for the massive star - forming galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "this may suggest that high - redshift massive star - forming galaxies are characterized by rising sfhs , in agreement with recent works ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found a similar result when comparing @xmath109 galaxies to the @xmath21 quiescent population , with the local population of mqgs approximately as numerous as the entire massive population at @xmath109 .",
    "this could suggest that mechanisms for quenching , either the same over the history of the universe or of different nature at different epochs , are ongoing more or less continuously since @xmath110 .",
    "several works have demonstrated that the vast majority of massive quiescent @xmath3 galaxies are also compact ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this allows us to directly compare our number densities for compact , massive , quiescent galaxies to the number densities at @xmath111 from @xcite .",
    "@xcite published an estimate of the number density of compact , massive , quiescent galaxies , based on the stellar mass function of @xcite .",
    "the corresponding value is marked in figure [ fig : numden ] by the crossed - circle symbol .",
    "we increased the original error bar to take into account the effects of cosmic variance using the @xcite recipe , and adding it in quadrature .",
    "the final error bar is a factor of @xmath112 the error bar quoted in the original work , but more representative of the true uncertainties .",
    "as is seen in the right panel of figure [ fig : numden ] , the number density @xmath113 of massive galaxies that are compact at @xmath2 ( which also corresponds to the number density @xmath114 of massive quiescent galaxies at @xmath2 ) is a factor of @xmath115 smaller compared to the number density of all massive galaxies .",
    "their evolution to @xmath28 using our chosen sfhs ( blue box ) produces a number density which is approximately a factor of @xmath116 smaller than the number density of massive quiescent galaxies from @xcite , and consistent only at a 2@xmath117 level .",
    "we can explain the decrease in number density between @xmath46 and @xmath3 in the context of our evolution models : the increase with cosmic time of the fraction of mass returned to the ism decreases the stellar mass .",
    "one possible source of the discrepancy between our measured number density and @xcite could be the different criteria adopted by @xcite to select the quiescent population ( the uvj color selection - @xcite ) .",
    "in a recent work , @xcite showed that the fraction of quiescent galaxies selected at @xmath118 using the uvj method is equivalent to a ssfr@xmath119yr@xmath15 criteria and with @xmath59 are lower than log(ssfr / yr@xmath15)@xmath120 , with a 75% upper limit log(ssfr / yr@xmath15)@xmath121 and a median log(ssfr / yr@xmath15)@xmath122 .",
    "it is worth noting that we do not find @xmath2 compact , massive , star - forming galaxies , and specifically compact , massive galaxies with @xmath123ssfr / yr@xmath15@xmath124 which , following our evolutionary models , would eventually become compact , massive , quiescent by @xmath3 .",
    "this means that our measurement of the number density of compact , massive , quiescent galaxies at @xmath55 does not change if we use a ssfr that is compatible with that for a uvj cut .    when we compare the expected number density of cmq galaxies that have been evolved from @xmath46 with the measured sample of @xmath28 mq galaxies from nmbs ( nearly all of which are compact ) , we find that the two agree to within one sigma .",
    "the plot shows also that the number density from @xcite is higher than our measurements , and compatible only with the upper end of the @xcite .",
    "one possible reason for this discrepancy could be that @xcite assume the fraction of massive , quiescent galaxies to be 0.5 , likely a too optimistic choice ( e.g. @xcite ) .    similar to the left panel , in the right panel of figure [ fig : numden ] the number densities from the individual sfhs are marked . for the compact massive galaxies , the number density from the csfh is compatible with the measurements from the other sfhs , in agreement with recent works ( see e.g. @xcite ) .      in order to try to understand the possible mechanisms which could be responsible for the build up of the compact , massive , quiescent population at @xmath3",
    ", we implemented a very simple statistical model for how mergers could affect the evolution in the observed number densities .",
    "our toy model consists of randomly choosing pairs of galaxies among the 110 galaxies with @xmath2 and with a measurement of the @xmath58 and leaving the sfh of each galaxy to evolve independently of its companion .",
    "the stellar mass of the merged pair was finally considered as the algebraic sum of the two components ; the ssfr was computed as the mass - weighted sum of each component ( or , equivalently , as the sum of the two sfrs divided by the total stellar mass ) , while we assumed for the @xmath58 of the merged pair the @xmath58 of the more massive companion .",
    "the effect of merging on the number density evolution are represented in the right panel of figure [ fig : numden ] by the red box ; the result is an agreement between the observed number density of compact mqgs at @xmath3 and that from our models , for all the sfh but the csf . in this case ,",
    "in fact , the number density is even smaller than the number density of the population without merging . in the framework of our toy model ,",
    "this is due to the high probability that each pair contains a galaxy with high sfr .",
    "the end product is then biased towards high ssfr galaxies at the end of the merging process .    given the potential effect of a starburst or agn that is triggered by the merger , we also examined a scenario in which the sf is quenched following the merger .",
    "this is supported by recent hydrodynamical simulations in which mergers play an important role in the gravitational heating of the halo gas , and consequently in the suppression of star formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "however we would like to note that this last process does not improve the agreement significantly , except for the csf case , for which the number density falls well within the values from the other sfh .",
    "good agreement between the expected and observed number densities for our evolved , merged , and quenched model is also found when we compare the expected number densities to those calculated from the full nmbs sample using a @xmath125ssfr / yr@xmath126 cut .",
    "this comparison is useful as the full nmbs catalog has a higher precision than our sample that is limited to the area with candels overlap .",
    "although the merging model appears to be in better agreement with the data , it is clear that even a simple evolution model with no merging provides an adequate match to the data .",
    "therefore , merging and quenching , which are both likely processes that are occurring in the galaxy population , are not required to explain the number densities .",
    "+ if the two quiescent galaxies with mips detections indeed have the extreme sfrs implied by the rest - frame 5.6  @xmath39 m fluxes , our results on the potential importance of merging would remain qualitatively unchanged .",
    "this is because these two galaxies are only 13 - 20% of the whole sample of galaxies that would be classified as massive at @xmath55 .",
    "if the truncated post - merger sfh is correct then the results will also remain quantitatively similar as the prompt quenching of star formation assumed in this model would turn them into massive quiescent galaxies by @xmath55 .",
    "according to current semi - analytic models for the formation of massive quiescent galaxies , the bulk of the stellar mass was formed as a compact , massive spheroid at @xmath2 through gas - rich merger events ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , in the redshift range between @xmath127 and @xmath16 , the models predict that the central galaxy would still be building up from gas flows which would feed the the formation of stars in the central region of the galaxy directly , forming the concentrated stellar system @xcite . in a second stage ,",
    "quenching mechanisms such as major merger or feedback from agn or from star formation would convert the full population of massive galaxies into the population of quiescent massive galaxies observed at later cosmic times .",
    "subsequent minor dry mergers would be responsible for the increase in size @xcite , while keeping the gain in stellar mass to a factor of @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "understanding _ what _ are the physical mechanisms of star - formation quenching , _ when _ they started to act and _ how long _ they took to completely quench star - formation is then a central key in our knowledge of formation and evolution of local massive quiescent galaxies .",
    "while our analysis does not provide us with significant information on the physical mechanisms , it allows us to put new constraints on both when star - formation quenching could have happened and on how fast it could be .",
    "in fact , the compatibility of the number density of massive @xmath2 galaxies with the number density of @xmath3 massive quiescent galaxies from the literature suggests that the population of massive quiescent galaxies at @xmath3 can be completely accounted for by the observed @xmath2 population of massive galaxies that is subsequently quenched .",
    "specifically , when evolving our sample of @xmath2 galaxies to @xmath28 , a good agreement is obtained introducing quenching of star - formation after merging , process which is supported by recent hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "secondly , our observations of compact , massive , quiescent galaxies at @xmath129 push back in time the appearance of this class of objects to when the universe was @xmath130 gyr old .    finally , considering that",
    ", according to models , massive galaxies should still be actively forming stars at @xmath131 , then the observation of compact massive galaxies which are already quiescent by @xmath129 imposes that the quenching of star formation should be a rapid mechanism in massive galaxies , acting on timescales of less than 1  gyr in the early universe .",
    "in this work we used two overlapping public sets of data in a region of the cosmos field to identify the progenitors at @xmath132 of the compact , massive , quiescent galaxies observed at @xmath3 .",
    "stellar masses , ssfrs and photometric redshifts were taken from the nmbs .",
    "the sizes were measured on high - resolution candels f160w images .",
    "the population of @xmath132 galaxies was evolved to @xmath28 using @xcite models following five different sfhs ( constant , delayed - exponential , truncated delayed - exponential , exponential and truncated exponential ) .",
    "all the number densities were computed assuming a co - moving volume corresponding to @xmath82 .",
    "our main results can be summarized by the following points :    1 .",
    "we discovered four compact , massive ( @xmath53 ) quiescent ( sed - based ssfr@xmath133  yr@xmath15 ) galaxies at @xmath132 , corresponding to a completeness - corrected number density of @xmath134  mpc@xmath87 .",
    "if the two galaxies with mips detection were excluded , the resulting completeness - corrected number density would be @xmath135  mpc@xmath87 .",
    "2 .   for a complete sample of 10 galaxies with @xmath136",
    ", we found that the quiescent ( ssfr@xmath133 yr@xmath15 ) galaxies are compact ( @xmath137 kpc ) , while the star - forming galaxies are extended ( @xmath138 kpc ) , qualitatively similar to what is found at lower redshifts ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "if the two quiescent galaxies with mips 24  @xmath39 m detection were considered star forming , the averaged sizes of the quiescent and star - forming galaxies would be @xmath139  kpc and @xmath140  kpc , respectively .",
    "3 .   we found five compact ( @xmath141  kpc ) , star - forming ( ssfr@xmath142  yr@xmath15 ) galaxies at @xmath46 with large stellar masses ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "the small effective radius was confirmed by a @xcite profile fitting of the stacked image .",
    "the number density of massive @xmath2 galaxies is comparable to the number density of @xmath3 massive quiescent galaxies from the literature .",
    "the evolution of the number density of the @xmath2 galaxy population to @xmath3 can be accounted for with a family of decaying or truncated sfhs .",
    "the csf sfh does not fit the observed number densities .",
    "a model with quenching of the sfr between @xmath28 and 3 does .",
    "when we evolve our @xmath2 galaxies to @xmath28 , we find that the predicted number density of compact , massive , quiescent galaxies is consistent at the @xmath144 level for all of our adopted sfhs .",
    "an even better agreement is obtained if we quench the star formation after the merging event .",
    "such a rapid truncation is supported by recent simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .      *",
    "the population of massive quiescent galaxies at @xmath3 can be completely accounted for by the observed @xmath2 population of massive galaxies that is subsequently quenched . *",
    "the existence of compact , massive , quiescent galaxies at @xmath129 pushes back in time the appearance of this class of objects to when the universe was @xmath130  gyr old . * since galaxy formation models predict that at @xmath131 galaxies should still be building up from gas flows , the existence of compact , massive galaxies that are quiescent already at @xmath129 implies that the quenching of star formation should be a rapid mechanism , acting on timescales of less than 1  gyr in the early universe .",
    "we note that half of the sub - sample of massive and quiescent galaxies is detected in mips , implying large sfrs if the mir emission were associated to dust - enshrouded star formation . since the mips band probes rest - frame wavelengths shorter than 6 @xmath39 m at @xmath2 ( i.e. , emission from hot dust ) , sfrs derived from mips are very uncertain and can potentially be contaminated by emission from a dusty torus of an agn .",
    "observations in the far - ir ( e.g. , alma ) are needed to robustly quantify the level of obscured star formation and to confirm the quiescent nature of these galaxies .",
    "the analysis presented in this work is based on a sample size of about one hundred objects , resulting from the intersection of two catalogs , candels and nmbs on the single cosmos field .",
    "recent projects like the 3d - hst survey @xcite will provide accurate redshift for @xmath145 objects at @xmath146 over a total area a factor of @xmath147 larger than the one available for this work",
    ". this will reduce by a large amount both the poisson noise and the uncertainties due to the cosmic variance .",
    "additionally , the increase in photometric depth from both candels and the 3d - hst with respect to the currently available data sets will also allow us to probe the population of galaxies down do smaller stellar masses .",
