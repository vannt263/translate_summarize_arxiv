    "theories with extradimensions are expected to solve the hierarchy problem and the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "the great challenge with extradimensions is to conciliate the extradimensions with the fact that we observe only four dimensions .",
    "the typical way is to assume that we live on branes @xcite .",
    "the branes are @xmath4-dimensional subspace of the entire extradimensional space - time where the matter fields are trapped .",
    "one possible extradimensional geometry was proposed by randall - sundram ( rs ) , where the extradimensions is warped .",
    "the rs brane model is formulated in five space - time dimensions  @xcite and shows that the exponential warp factor in the metric can generate a large hierarchy of scales .",
    "however , such models require a fine tuning between the parameters of the model . note that in the rs model , the brane is infinitely thin .",
    "such a fine tuning is usually not needed if thick branes are considered .",
    "for instance , the brane theories in six dimensions in the abelian strings show a very distinct feature towards the fine - tuning and negative tension brane problems  @xcite .",
    "similar compactification was achieved for magnetic monopoles , both for positive and negative cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "the skyrme model  @xcite is originally a model for the nucleons after a suitable quantization scheme  @xcite .",
    "there is a low - dimensional mimic of the model called baby - skyrme model .",
    "the baby - skyrme model possesses soliton solutions called the baby - skyrmions in two dimensional space  @xcite .",
    "the warped compactification of the two dimensional extra space by such baby - skyrmions was already studied  @xcite for negative bulk cosmological constant , based on the assumption that the cosmological constant inside the three branes is tentatively set to be zero . addressing the non - zero cosmological constant inside the branes has been considered for case of the strings  @xcite and the monopoles  @xcite . along these directions , we also have studied the baby - skyrmion brane with both positive brane cosmological constant and a bulk cosmological constant  @xcite .    the localization of particles such as fermions  @xcite and a gauge field  @xcite on these branes have also been studied . according to the index theorem a nonzero topological charge implies a zero modes of the dirac operator @xcite .",
    "the zero crossing modes are found to be the localized fermions on the brane .",
    "it follows that the generation of the fermions emerges as an effect of the topological charge of the skyrmions with a special quantum number assigned by @xmath5 .",
    "there are different profiles of the zero crossing behavior for different @xmath5 , and in our opinion , this might give an origin of the finite mass generation fermions .",
    "in this paper we begin our analysis for the topological charge @xmath6 because it is the number of particle generations in the fermions . as the straightforward extension , the case of @xmath7",
    "is also examined .    in our previous studies , we have found an essential requirement for the geometry of the brane solutions : the brane should slightly deform from the axisymmetric shape in order to explain the small mass difference between the first two generations of quarks ( such as @xmath8 mev , which is much smaller than the difference of the first and third : @xmath9 mev ) . in @xcite",
    ", we introduced an effect of the deformation for the matter fields by hand and found that about for a slight deformation of the skyrmion the result is in good agreement with the experiment .",
    "the drawbacks of the analysis are : ( i ) we need to introduce an arbitrary deformation parameter , ( ii ) we ignore effect of the deformation for the gravity side .",
    "our main concern of this paper is thus to find brane solutions with spontaneously broken axisymmetry .",
    "the solutions with lower symmetry , such as @xmath10-symmetry without gravity were already found using numerical simulation  @xcite where an energy minimization scheme called the _ simulated annealing method _  ( sa )  @xcite was used .",
    "for the analysis of the brane solutions , the coupled system of matter field equations and einstein equations has to be treated and the sa scheme is not suitable for the purpose .",
    "therefore , as a first step , we solve baby - skyrme field equations without gravity by employing the standard _ successive over - relaxation method _   ( sor ) and compare the obtained results by the sa as a validation of our code .    for the brane solutions , we use an ansatz for the line element which is a function of both",
    "the two extra coordinates @xmath11 , inspired by the lewis - papapetrou ansatz .",
    "the resulting coupled partial differential equations are numerically solved in terms of the sor  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we start with a brief introduction to the baby - skyrme model and show the results using sa",
    ". we also present the euler - lagrange equations of the non symmetric solutions .",
    "the corresponding brane model is extensively discussed in sec.iii . in sec.iv",
    "we present the numerical solutions and give a brief summary of our results in sec.v .",
    "the lagrangian density of the baby - skyrme model is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes a triplet of real scalar fields with the constraint @xmath14 .",
    "the constants @xmath15 are parameter with dimension [ @xmath16 ,  [ @xmath17 ,  [ @xmath18 respectively , where @xmath19 is the dimension of mass .",
    "the first term in ( [ eq : action ] ) is nothing but the non - linear @xmath20 model while the second term is inspired by the quartic term of the @xmath21 skyrme model .",
    "the potential @xmath22 is necessary for the stability of the solutions in the sense of derrick s argument . while the first two terms are invariant under a global @xmath23 symmetry , @xmath24 , the potential breaks it .",
    "several choices of potentials have been investigated .",
    "two @xmath25-symmetric potentials have been intensively studied , namely the old - type @xmath26 @xcite and the new - type potential @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "potentials with no @xmath25 symmetry have been studied in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors generalized the old - type potential to @xmath28 and were able to build solutions that deviate from the axial symmetry .",
    "the model admits an analytical solution ( holomorphic solution ) for a single soliton for @xmath29 .",
    "the force between two holomorphic solutions is always repulsive so that multi - soliton solutions tend to deviate from axial symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the topological charge of the baby - skyrmion is defined as @xmath30 in @xmath1 flat spacetime . the numerical analysis in @xcite has been done by minimizing the following energy functional @xmath31 in the polar coordinate @xmath32 .",
    "the method is a kind of the monte carlo method in which one generates random numbers and properly change the value of the fields @xmath33 by the numbers so as to fall down the energy .",
    "the more sophisticated method may be applied to the problem .",
    "the _ simulated annealing method _  ( sa )  @xcite is the application of the metropolis algorithm which can successfully avoids the unwelcome saddle points .    the solutions for @xmath34 exhibit a non - axisymmetric shape for certain parameter ranges of the coupling constant @xmath35 or of the value of @xmath36 .",
    "we confirm the results of @xcite by minimizing the energy per topological charge in terms of the sa . in fig.[fig : annealing_e ] , we plot the typical results of the energy densities of the skyrmion with varying @xmath35 . as was found in @xcite , at a critical value of @xmath35 , breaking of the rotational symmetry",

    "we solve the euler - lagrange equations derived from the action ( [ eq : action ] ) and try to reproduce the results of the sa .",

    "the model has weak isospin symmetry and the isodoublet of the quarks are degenerate .",
    "we expect that the brane slightly deforms from the axisymmetry and reproduce the slight splitting the mass of the first and second levels  @xcite .",
    "now we got the intuition that the level splitting of the generations is owed by the coupling constant of the old - baby potential @xmath71 .",
    "more thorough analysis of the property of the localized fermions in these funny structures of the brane will be certainly very interesting .",
