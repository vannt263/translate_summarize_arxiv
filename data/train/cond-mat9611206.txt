    "on many crystal surfaces step edge barriers are observed which prevent interlayer ( downward ) hopping of diffusing adatoms @xcite . in homoepitaxy from a molecular beam this leads to a growth instability which can be understood on a basic level : adatoms form islands on the initial substrate and matter deposited on top of them is caught there by the step edge barrier .",

    "their lateral size @xmath3 is found experimentally to increase according to a power law in time , @xmath0 with @xmath4  6 depending on the material and , possibly , deposition conditions used .",
    "a second characteristic is the slope of the mounds hillsides @xmath5 , which is observed to either approach a constant ( often referred to as a `` magic slope '' since it does not necessarily coincide with a high symmetry plane ) or to increase with time as @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the surface width ( or the height of the mounds ) then grows as @xmath7 with @xmath8 , where @xmath9 for the case of magic slopes .    on a macroscopic level",
    "these instabilities can be understood in terms of a growth - induced , slope - dependent surface current @xcite . since diffusing adatoms",
    "preferably attach to steps from the terrace _ below _ , rather than from _ above _ , the current is uphill and destabilizing .",
    "the concentration of diffusing adatoms is maintained by the incoming particle flux ; thus , the surface current is a nonequilibrium effect .",
    "the macroscopic view is quantified in a continuum growth equation , which has been proposed and studied by several groups @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present contribution is to obtain analytic estimates for the scaling exponents and scaling functions of this continuum theory . to give an outline of the article : in the next section we briefly introduce the continuum equations of interest .",
    "a simple scaling ansatz , presented in section 3 , leads to scaling relations and inequalities for the exponents @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in section 4",
    "we present a solvable mean  field model for the dynamics of the height  height correlation function . up to logarithmic corrections , the relations of section 3 are corroborated .",
    "finally , in the concluding section 5 the mean  field correlation functions are compared to numerical simulations of the full growth equation , and the special character of the mean  field approximation is pointed out .",
    "under conditions typical of molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , evaporation and the formation of bulk defects can be neglected .",
    "the height @xmath12 of the surface above the substrate plane then satisfies a continuity equation , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the incident mass flux out of the molecular beam . since we are interested in large scale features we neglect fluctuations in @xmath14 ( `` shot noise '' ) and in the surface current ( `` diffusion noise '' ) . in general , the systematic current @xmath15 depends on the whole surface configuration . keeping only the most important terms in a gradient expansion , such as @xmath16 , though they may well be relevant for the coarsening behavior of the surface @xcite . ] , subtracting the mean height @xmath17 , and using appropriately rescaled units of height , distance and time @xcite , eq .",

    "we consider two different forms for the function @xmath20 :    \\(i ) within a burton - cabrera - frank - type theory @xcite , for small tilts the current is proportional to @xmath21 , and in the opposite limit it is proportional to @xmath22 .",

    "a simple choice , which places the magic slope at @xmath28 , is @xmath29};\\ ] ] a microscopic calculation of the surface current for a model exhibiting magic slopes has been reported by amar and family @xcite .",
    "the stability properties of a surface with uniform slope @xmath30 are obtained by inserting the ansatz @xmath31 into ( [ cont2 ] ) and expanding to linear order in @xmath32 .",

    "if one of them is negative , the surface is unstable to fluctuations varying in the corresponding direction : variations perpendicular to * m * will grow when the current is uphill ( when @xmath37 ) , while variations in the direction of * m * grow when the current is an increasing function of the tilt .",
    "both models have a change in the sign of @xmath38 , model ( i ) at @xmath39 , model ( ii ) at @xmath40 . for model ( i )",
    "@xmath41 always , corresponding to the step meandering instability of bales and zangwill @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for model ( ii ) the current is downhill for slopes @xmath42 , and these surfaces are absolutely stable .    in this work we focus on singular surfaces , @xmath43 , which are unstable in both models ; coarsening behavior of vicinal surfaces has been studied elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the situation envisioned in the rest of this article is the following : for solutions of the pde ( [ cont2 ] ) we choose a flat surface with small random fluctuations @xmath44 as initial condition .",
    "mostly the initial fluctuations will be uncorrelated in space , though the effect of long range initial correlations is briefly addressed in section [ meanfield ] .",
    "the fluctuations are amplified by the linear instability , and eventually the surface enters the late time coarsening regime that we wish to investigate .",
    "in this section we assume that in the late time regime the solution of ( [ cont2 ] ) is described by a scaling form , namely that the surface @xmath45 at time @xmath46 has the same ( statistical ) properties as the rescaled surface @xmath47 at time @xmath48 . the equal time height ",
    "height correlation function @xmath49 then has a scaling form @xmath50 where the relevant lengthscales are the surface width @xmath51 , i.e.  the typical height of the mounds , and their lateral size @xmath52 , given by the first zero of @xmath53 .",
    "these choices correspond to @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "moreover they lead to a definition of the typical slope of mounds as @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "we start our reasoning with the time dependence of the width @xmath58 clearly @xmath59 .",
    "since we expect the width to increase with time , we obtain the inequalities @xmath60 and @xmath61    the first conclusion can be drawn even without the scaling assumption : for model ( ii ) and model ( i ) with @xmath27 , @xmath62 has an upper bound , and so has @xmath63 .",
    "therefore @xmath64 .",
    "we conclude that the increase of the width @xmath65 can not be faster than @xmath66 if it is caused by a destabilizing nonequilibrium current on a surface with step edge barriers .    assuming scaling we estimate @xmath67 and @xmath68 . for model ( i )",
    "we further have @xmath69 . in terms of the scaling exponents @xmath70 and @xmath71 inequality ( [ ineqa ] ) yields @xmath72 , while the second inequality ( [ ineqb ] ) leads to @xmath73 .",
    "combining both inequalities we have @xmath74    to proceed we note that an upper bound on the lateral mound size @xmath3 can be obtained from the requirement that the mounds should be stable against the bales - zangwill step meandering instability @xcite : otherwise they would break up into smaller mounds .",
    "> from ( [ linstab ] ) it is easy to see that , for the large slopes of interest here , fluctuations of a wavelength exceeding @xmath75 are unstable . since @xmath76 , we impose the condition @xmath77 or , in terms of scaling exponents , @xmath78 hence the first relation in ( [ ineq1 ] ) becomes an equality ( which was previously derived for the one - dimensional case @xcite ) , and the second relation yields @xmath79\\ ] ]    for model ( ii ) we assume that the slope @xmath5 approaches its stable value @xmath80 as @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "the estimate of the last term in ( [ widthdyn ] ) then becomes @xmath83 .",
    "thus inequality ( [ ineqa ] ) yields @xmath84 , and from ( [ ineqb ] ) it follows follows that @xmath85 . as for model ( i )",
    "the next estimation uses @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "again we obtain the inverse of the second of the above inequalities , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath88 .",
    "altogether this yields @xmath89\\ ] ]    to summarize the general results obtained in this section : in addition to the bound on the temporal increase of the surface width , @xmath90 , the scaling ansatz yields an upper bound on the increase of the lateral length scale , @xmath91 , valid for both models . a more elaborate approximation , to be presented in the next section , predicts the above inequalitites ( [ scalineq],[scalineq2 ] ) to hold as equalities ( up to logarithmic corrections ) .",
    "we consider the time dependence of the equal time height - height correlation function defined above : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the laplace operator . in order to obtain a closed equation for @xmath94",
    "we replace @xmath20 by @xmath95 in the second term on the right hand side .",
    "this approach is inspired by the spherical ` large @xmath96 ' limit of phase ordering kinetics @xcite , and will be referred to as the spherical approximation .",

    "it consists of fluctuations at early times , i.e.  the first nucleated islands , from which mounds will later develop .",
    "simulations of microscopic models for mbe on singular surfaces at submonolayer coverages @xcite indicate the following shape of @xmath109 : from a hump at some finite wavenumber , corresponding to the typical distance @xmath110 between island nuclei , it falls off to zero for @xmath111 .",
    "for @xmath112 it goes down to a _ finite _",
    "value @xmath113 .    at late times",
    "the hump in @xmath101 persists , situated at some @xmath114 near the maximum of the exponential in ( [ formal ] ) .",

    "@xmath114 will go to zero , so we need only consider @xmath109 near @xmath115 .",
    "in fact for the leading contribution to @xmath114 ( and the leading power in @xmath3 ) we only need @xmath116 .",
    "more detailed remarks on the case @xmath117 and on the presence of long range correlations in the initial stage can be found at the end of this section .",
    "the particular value of @xmath118 has no influence on the coarsening exponent , so we take @xmath119 which corresponds to @xmath120 .    to follow the analysis , note that @xmath104 is a functional ( [ a(t ) ] ) of @xmath101 , and on the other hand it is used for the calculation of @xmath101 .",
    "this imposes a condition of self consistency on the solution , which we write as follows @xmath121 we used the initial conditions motivated above , and the shorthand @xmath122 .",
    "the integral can be evaluated , yielding for @xmath123 the differential equation @xmath124 where @xmath125 denotes a parabolic cylinder function @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ dgl ] ) can not be solved explicitly , but for the late time behavior we can use an asymptotic approximation for @xmath125 , since its argument @xmath126 for @xmath127 . to see this , note that ( [ dgl ] ) is of the form @xmath128 therefore , if @xmath129 remained bounded , for large @xmath46 the argument of @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( [ dgl ] ) would be close to 0 , and ( [ dgl ] ) would approximately be @xmath130 .",
    "this is in contradiction to the assumption @xmath131 const.@xmath132 which therefore can not be true .    for large @xmath46 ( and large @xmath129 )",
    "we then approximate ( [ dgl ] ) by @xmath133 this shows that @xmath129 must grow more slowly than any power of @xmath46 : if @xmath134 then @xmath135 , whereas the argument in @xmath97 would increase exponentially , dominated by a term @xmath136 .",
    "for both choices ( [ model(i ) ] ) and ( [ model(ii ) ] ) of @xmath97 the right hand side of ( [ dgl ] ) would decrease much faster than the left or even become negative .    depending on the choice of the current function @xmath97 we get different asymptotic behaviors in the leading logarithmic increase of @xmath137 .",
    "we first consider the case ( ii ) , where @xmath138 . here",
    "( [ dgl ] ) reads @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a constant without any interest .",

    "equation ( [ dgl ] ) then becomes @xmath146 again the powers of @xmath46 in the last term must cancel , yielding @xmath147 there is a noteworthy correspondence between models ( i ) and ( ii ) : the solution of ( ii ) is the limit @xmath148 of the solution of ( i ) . in this sense ,",
    "a current which vanishes at a finite slope is equivalent to a positive shape function @xmath149 decreasing faster than any power of @xmath5 .",
    "the same correspondence applies also on the level of the inequalities derived in section [ scalingansatz ] , as can be seen by letting @xmath148 in ( [ scalineq ] ) and comparing to ( [ scalineq2 ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic form of @xmath123 gives us the following time dependence of the coarsening surface structure : inserting @xmath123 into the expression for the structure factor @xmath101 ( [ formal ] ) we obtain for each time @xmath46 a wavenumber @xmath150 which has the maximal contribution to @xmath101 .",
    "it can be interpreted as the inverse of a typical lateral lengthscale @xmath151 . up to a logarithmic factor",
    ", we obtain lateral coarsening with a power @xmath152 for both choices of @xmath149 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath2 , which saturates the bound derived in section [ scalingansatz ] .",
    "it is however important to note that the resulting structure factor _ can not _ be written in a simple scaling form @xmath153 , as would be expected if @xmath154 were the only scale in the problem @xcite .",
    "rather , one obtains the _ multiscaling form _",
    "@xcite @xmath155 where @xmath156 , and @xmath157 is a second lengthscale in the system .",
    "in contrast to @xmath154 , the exponent describing the temporal increase of @xmath158 _ does _ depend on the shape of the current function @xmath97 .",
    "next we discuss the behavior of the typical slope of the coarsening mounds , given by @xmath159 .",
    "this is obtained directly from ( [ selfc ] ) . for model ( ii )",
    "@xmath104 approaches the stable value ( `` magic slope '' ) @xmath160 , with a leading correction @xmath161 note that the approach to the magic slope is very slow , a possible explanation for the common difficulty of deciding whether @xmath104 attains a final value or grows indefinitely in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we further remark that , up to a logarithmic factor , the inequality @xmath162 derived in ( [ scalineq2 ] ) for the exponent describing the approach to the magic slope becomes an equality within the spherical approximation",
    ".    for model ( i ) the typical slopes diverge as @xmath163 consistent with the value @xmath164 derived as a bound in ( [ scalineq ] ) . in the limit @xmath148 the slope does not increase at all , which again is comparable to the presence of a stable slope .    to close this section we briefly comment on the the shape of the structure factor @xmath101 and the correlation function @xmath94 obtained within the spherical approximation .",
    "assuming initial correlations as used above , @xmath116 , the structure factor is analytical at any time @xmath46 , as can be seen in equation ( [ formal ] ) .",
    "the corresponding correlation function therefore decays faster than any power of @xmath100 , modulated with oscillations of wavenumber @xmath165 .",
    "we can also predict the further evolution of long range correlations , assuming that they were initially present .",
    "a power law decay of @xmath166 corresponds to a singularity in @xmath109 .",
    "suppose the singularity is located at some point @xmath167 ( the power decay of @xmath53 is then modulated by oscillations ) .",
    "then the singularity will remain present in @xmath101 , but it will be suppressed as @xmath168 for late times .",
    "this implies that @xmath94 has a very weak power law tail for very large @xmath100 , but up to some @xmath169 ( which increases with time ) it decays faster than any power .",
    "however a singularity in @xmath109 will not be suppressed if it lies at the origin @xmath170 , since then in eq.([formal ] ) it is multiplied by unity . in real space",
    ", this implies that a power law decay of correlations without oscillations will remain present .",
    "even if @xmath109 is singular at @xmath171 , the scaling laws derived above remain valid .",
    "suppose for example that @xmath172 for @xmath112 . in transforming ( [ formal ] ) back to real space",
    ", such a power law singularity can be absorbed into the phase space factor @xmath173 involved in the @xmath174-integration .",
    "the result is simply a shift in the dimensionality , @xmath175 , which affects the prefactors of the scaling laws ( [ km ] ) , ( [ magic ] ) and ( [ steep ] ) for @xmath176 and @xmath104 but not the powers of @xmath177 .",
    "we have presented two approximate ways to predict the late stage of mound coarsening in homoepitaxial growth . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first theoretical calculation of coarsening exponents for this problem .",
    "although we have made heavy use of concepts developed in phase  ordering kinetics @xcite , our results can not be directly inferred from the existing theories in that field . as was explained in detail by siegert @xcite , equation ( [ cont2 ] ) rewritten for the slope @xmath178 has the form of a relaxation dynamics driven by a generalized free energy , @xmath179 .",
    "phase ordering with a conserved vector order parameter @xmath30 is described by a similar form , @xmath180 , however it appears that the interchange of the order of the differential operators , from @xmath181 to @xmath182 , may lead to a qualitatively different behavior @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the results obtained so far must be refined .",
    "ideally , one would like to derive _ equalities _ for the exponents using the scaling ansatz of section [ scalingansatz ] .",
    "more modestly , it would be desirable to extend the approach so that the effects of current functions without in - plane isotropy @xcite and of contributions proportional to @xmath16 @xcite on the scaling behavior can be assessed .",
    "the main drawback of the spherical approximation in section [ meanfield ] is that it does not predict conventional scaling .",
    "the experience from phase  ordering kinetics in the @xmath183 model suggests that the multiscaling behavior obtained above may be an artefact of the spherical approximation @xcite . to address this issue ,",
    "we have carried out a numerical integration of equation ( [ cont2 ] ) , with weak uncorrelated noise as initial condition .",
    "the results indicate conventional scaling behavior in the late stage of growth , with exponents @xmath2 , @xmath164 , which saturate the bounds of section [ scalingansatz ] .",
    "figure [ fig : scalplot ] shows a scaling plot of @xmath184 of model ( i ) with @xmath25 for times @xmath185 obtained from the numerical integration of ( [ cont2 ] ) .",
    "it is compared at times @xmath186 to the spherical approximation .",
    "the first zero and the width at @xmath187 are rescaled to @xmath188 .",
    "initial conditions of the approximation were chosen to coincide with the full dynamics at @xmath189 .",
    "the spherical approximation of @xmath53 takes a slightly different shape ",
    "its oscillations are more pronounced for larger @xmath100 .",
    "we obtained a similar scaling plot for @xmath190 and for model ( ii ) .",
    "the inset shows the evolution of the first zero of @xmath53 : in the full dynamics it is best approximated by a power law @xmath191 with @xmath192 for the full dynamics , where @xmath193 .",
    "the spherical approximation deviates from a power law . here for late times the best fit is @xmath194 with @xmath195 .",
    "the beginning of the time integration @xmath196 does not coincide with the exptrapolated zero of the power laws @xmath197 , because the mounds take a finite time to develop out of the initial growth instability .",

    "we obtain @xmath200 and @xmath201 . for model ( ii )",
    "we refer to the intergrations of siegert @xcite , which indicate @xmath202 .",
    "note that the multiscaling behavior of @xmath53 in the spherical approximation is very weak , in the sense that the curves at different times do not differ in shape too much . a more sensitive test of the scaling behavior of equation ( [ cont1 ] )",
    ", in order to pin down the difference to the spherical approximation , would be desirable and can be achieved by extracting the function @xmath203 ( see eq.([multi ] ) ) from the data of the numerical integration .",
