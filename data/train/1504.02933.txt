    "then , we fitted gaussian functions to the h@xmath1 emission lines , in order to determine the radial velocities of the molecular - gas clouds .",

    "c_. the radial velocity value provided by this fit is essentially as precise as the one provided by the gaussian fit applied to the br@xmath0 emission line in fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] .",
    "the radial velocities obtained for the molecular - gas clouds are shown in table  [ tbl3 ] .",
    "table  [ tbl3 ] confirms that the molecular - gas clouds with the highest velocity values are located approximately along the north - south direction .",

    "we presented a treatment procedure for vlt / sinfoni data cubes , which includes the following steps : correction of the dar ; spatial re - sampling , which provides a better visualization of the contours of the spatial structures ; butterworth spatial filtering , to remove high spatial - frequency components from the images of the data cubes ; instrumental fingerprint removal ; richardson - lucy deconvolution , to improve the spatial resolution of the data cubes .",
    "the main conclusions related to the steps of the data treatment procedure are as follows .",
    "* the dar effect may be significant for sinfoni data cubes obtained with the fore - optics with fovs of 0.8 and 3.2 arcsec , even if only one spectral band is considered . in the case of the fore - optics with fov of 8.0 arcsec",
    ", the correction of the dar may not be necessary .",
    "both the theoretical and the practical approaches are very effective in removing the dar , although the practical approach is a little more precise . * the spatial re - sampling followed by an interpolation of the values provides a clearer visualization of the contours of the spatial structures .",
    "we usually apply the spatial re - sampling to sinfoni data cubes ( observed with any fore - optics ) in order to double the number of spaxels along the horizontal and vertical axis . *",
    "a butterworth spatial filtering using a filter corresponding to the product between two identical circular filters removes most of the high spatial - frequency components ( mainly in the form of horizontal stripes ) from sinfoni data cubes , without compromising the images .",
    "* an instrumental fingerprint in the form of a large horizontal stripe at the bottom of the images and with a characteristic spectral signature is usually found in sinfoni data cubes .",
    "our method involving the pca tomography technique is very effective in removing this artefact from the data cubes . * with the richardson - lucy deconvolution , it is possible to obtain strehl ratios as high as 0.3 for the fore - optics with an fov of 3.2 arcsec and even higher than 2 for the fore - optics with an fov of 0.8 arcsec .",
    "the psfs of sinfoni data cubes correspond to a simple gaussian function for observations obtained with the fore - optics with an fov of 8.0 arcsec . on the other hand ,",
    "the psfs are composed of a gaussian and a lorentzian component for observations obtained with the fore - optics with fovs of 0.8 and 3.2 arcsec .    in order to give a scientific example of the efficacy of our data treatment procedure , we analysed a data cube of the nuclear region of the galaxy ngc 5643 , obtained with the fore - optics with an fov of 8.0 arcsec , and compared the results obtained with and without the treatment procedure .",
    "the main conclusions of this analysis are the following .",
    "* an extended emission can be easily seen in the images of the br@xmath0 emission line from the treated and non - treated data cubes of ngc 5643 .",
    "however , only the image from the treated data cube allows a clear visualization of individual ionized - gas clouds , which are almost impossible to visualize in the image from the non - treated data cube . *",
    "although we can not perform a detailed analysis of the ionized - gas kinematics ( due to our limited fov ) , the radial velocities determined for the ionized - gas clouds suggest the existence of an acceleration of the ionized gas near the agn , followed by a deceleration due to the interaction with the interstellar medium . *",
    "an extended molecular emission can also be seen in the images of the h@xmath1 emission line from the treated and non - treated data cubes of ngc 5643 .",
    "however , only the image from the treated data cube , again , allows a clear visualization of individual molecular - gas clouds . *",
    "the morphology of the h@xmath3 molecular emission can be explained by the existence of a molecular torus / disc structure along the north - south direction .",
    "one hypothesis is that the gas flows along the torus / disc towards the nucleus , feeding the agn .",
    "this torus / disc collimates the agn emission along the ionization cone .",
    "this scenario is compatible with the models proposed by @xcite , schmitt et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and @xcite and also with the unified model for agns .",
    "considering the benefits provided by our data treatment procedure , we conclude that this methodology may improve the quality of the analysis of sinfoni data cubes .",
