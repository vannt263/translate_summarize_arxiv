    "mn  doped ge has recently been proposed as a promising candidate in the challenging field of diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms)@xcite , which aims at combining information logic and storage .",
    "for example , epitaxial single crystal films of mn@xmath5ge@xmath6 ( @xmath7 8 - 10@xmath8 ) grown on gaas(001 ) and ge were found to exhibit curie temperatures over the range 25 to 116 k , combined with a @xmath9-type semiconducting behaviour@xcite .",
    "many efforts are presently devoted toward increasing the transition temperature up to or above room temperature . within this framework ,",
    "one possible way is to increase the concentration of magnetic impurities .",
    "however , one of the key issues in dms is indeed the solubility of mn in the semiconducting host : it is well known that beyond a certain critical mn concentration ( typically of the order of a few percent in iii - v hosts ) , a tendency toward clustering and phase separation occurs , thereby limiting the homogeneity and growth control that are strictly required for materials to be used in spintronic applications .",
    "this tendency was observed also during mn - alloying of ge samples : mn@xmath5ge@xmath10 precipitates were detected during out - of - equilibrium growth@xcite .",
    "intermetallic compounds of mn and ge occur in several different stoichiometries and crystallographic phases@xcite , most of which are antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic with rather low ordering temperatures . however , mn@xmath0ge@xmath1 @xmath2shows ferromagnetism with a curie temperature of @xmath11300 k , along with a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy along the @xmath3 axis of the hexagonal crystal structure ( see below)@xcite .",

    "phase epitaxy@xcite exhibited metallic conductivity and strong ferromagnetism up to 296 k  thus holding out promise for use in spin injection .",
    "moreover , very recently point contact andreev reflection spectroscopy was used to measure the spin  polarization of mn@xmath0ge@xmath1 @xmath2epilayers@xcite and the results were compared with calculated values within the density functional theory .",
    "the discrepancy between the experimental and predicted spin ",
    "polarization was attributed to the extreme sensitivity of calculated results to the crystallographic structure , as well as to possible mn deficiencies in mn@xmath0ge@xmath1 @xmath2samples.@xcite finally , it was shown experimentally,@xcite upon c doping ( with carbon interstitially incorporated into the voids of mn octahedra of the mn@xmath0ge@xmath1 @xmath2compound ) , that the curie temperature , @xmath12 , dramatically increased : mn@xmath0ge@xmath1c@xmath5 films for c concentration @xmath13 0.5 showed @xmath14 680 k.    so far , very little is known theoretically about mn@xmath0ge@xmath1 @xmath2 ; in particular , a careful investigation from first - principles of the magnetic interactions and chemical bonding between mn and metalloid atoms is still lacking . in this work , we perform a comprehensive study of mn@xmath0ge@xmath1 @xmath2within density functional theory ; in particular , in sec.[tech ] we report the technicalities related to the structure and to the computational approach . the electronic structure , as well as the related magnetism ,",

    "this choice was suggested by the more accurate treatment of this exchange  correlation functional for magnetic compounds with respect to the local spin - density approximation ( lsda)@xcite ; however , in order to test the resulting effects of a different ( @xmath15 ) parametrization and for the evaluation of the hyperfine fields , we also performed some calculations using the von barth - hedin@xcite functional within the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) .",

    "the eigenenergies @xmath24(*k * ) over a set of 150 * k * points were used for a spline fitting of the bands over the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "the resulting interpolating fourier series was then used to calculate the required energy derivative .",
    "a similar approach has been followed to calculate the electronic plasma frequency : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the fermi surface average . given the hexagonal symmetry , the quantities , @xmath27 = @xmath28 and @xmath29 = @xmath30 , will be evaluated .    according to forsyth and brown@xcite ,",

    "our gga calculated value , @xmath38 = 0.84 ev / formula  unit ( _ i.e. _ @xmath110.1 ev / atom ) , shows that mn@xmath0ge@xmath1 @xmath2is a quite stable compound .",

    "the ge atom shows slightly different pdos for up and down spins , consistent with the small negative magnetic moment ( see below ) . in the energy range",
    "considered , the largest contribution is due to @xmath9 states . on the mn sites , as expected ,",
    "contributions from @xmath40 and @xmath9 states ( not shown ) are negligible and the pdos is essentially dominated by the 3@xmath41 states . as a difference with the case of mn impurities in ge@xcite , we here have a much smaller hybridization between ge @xmath9 and mn @xmath41 states .",
    "in fact , we find the ge @xmath9 states at higher binding energy while the mn @xmath41 dominate the region close to the fermi level , showing a quite large mn ",
    "mn interaction .",
    "differences in the pdos of mn1 and mn2 are particularly evident in the majority spin occupied states ; in particular , from the analysis of the peaks on different atoms located at the same energies , we can infer that : _ i _ ) the mn1 features at @xmath11 - 0.7 ev and in  between -2 and -3 ev",
    "are due to mn1mn1 interactions ; _ ii _ ) the feature at @xmath11 - 1 - 2 ev is due to mn1-mn2 interactions ; _ iii _ ) the mn2 feature at -3.5 - 2.5 ev can be ascribed to mn2-mn2 interactions .",
    "the high  binding energy range ( @xmath42 - 3.5 ev ) shows hybridization of both mn atoms with ge .",
    "similarly , minority states for binding energies greater than 1.3 ev show common features for mn1 , mn2 and ge atoms , whereas the feature at around -1 - 0.5 ev results from mn1-mn2 hybridization .",
    "the unoccupied states , of interest for the discussion of magneto - optical properties ( see below ) , are largely due to the minority spin component and only show minor differences between mn1 and mn2 .",

    "the band structure for the majority and minority spins is shown in figure [ bande ] .",
    "we remark that the levels around @xmath39 ( see figure [ bande ] ( b ) and ( d ) ) are rather dispersed for the majority spin channel , whereas they are more localized in the minority spin component ; moreover , a non  dispersed region is evident for higher binding energies in the majority spin band structure ( in the energy range from -0.7 ev to -3.5 ev ) , as well as in the unoccupied minority spin band structure .",
    "the dispersion around @xmath39 in the up - spin component confirms the strong hybridization between mn1 and mn2 states , and between mn @xmath41 and @xmath9 ge states . roughly speaking , in fact , as already pointed out for the dos , the region at higher binding energies ( _ i.e. _ in the energy range between -7 ev and -1.5 ev ) is basically due to a large contribution from ge ; on the other hand , the levels around @xmath39 are basically due to both mn1 and mn2 in the minority spin channel , whereas a @xmath9 ge contribution hybridized with mn states is evident in the majority spin bands .",

    "the magnetic moments of the atomic species are calculated within their muffin - tin spheres , whereas the total contribution includes the contribution from the interstitial region .",
    "experimental values ( @xmath47 ) from refs . are shown in the last row . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ sumrule ]    in table [ sumrule ] we report our calculated values for the orbital and spin magnetic moments , as well as their ratio , as determined from sum rules ( sr ) for mn1 and mn2 atoms .",

    "the general trends of spin and magnetic moments for mn1 and mn2 atoms are qualitatively well reproduced .",
    "however , quantitatively , the sr magnetic moments are generally underestimated with respect to the self - consistently calculated values ( ranging from @xmath1110 percent in the case of spin magnetic moments up to 40 @xmath8 in the case of the small orbital moments ) .",
    "this has been ascribed@xcite to the several approximations made in deriving the sum rules@xcite , among which the most serious are _",

    "our results show that the two mn sites have different magnetic moments , leading to a total magnetization of 26 @xmath49 per unit cell ; the conducting character is strongly metallic with states around the fermi level essentially due to mn - mn interactions .",
