    "the explanation of the present state of our universe and the several structures appearing in it , has opened the gate to various reflexions .",
    "indeed , the current acceleration of the universe is widely accepted through several independent observational data , as supernovae ia @xcite-@xcite , the large scale structure of the universe @xcite , cosmic shear through gravitational weak lensing surveys @xcite and the lyman alpha forest absorption lines @xcite . due to the need to understand the acceleration of the universe ,",
    "various theories have been introduced .",
    "the well known standard equivalent theories , the general relativity ( gr ) and the teleparallel theory , are the first theories used for explaining the acceleration of the universe , including the existence of the dark energy as a new component of the universe @xcite .",
    "we recall here that the teleparallel theory is an idea of einstein in 1928 in his attempt to unify gravity and electromagnetism .",
    "this theory nowadays , is formulated as higher gauge theory @xcite ; furthermore it has already been established that gr can in fact be re - cast into teleparallel language @xcite , known as the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) . the second attempt in theories of gravity for explaining this state of universe",
    "consists to modify the gr and the teleparallel theory . due to the fact that the teleparallel theory does not yield consistent results according to the observational data , the immediate attempt to modify",
    "this theory of gravity is replacing the teleparallel term , the torsion scalar @xmath1 by an algebraic function @xmath0 based on the weitzenbck connection instead of levi - civita connection used in gr .",
    "furthermore , structure formations have also been investigated in this modified theory of gravity .",
    "the neutron stars structures have already been executed in several theories of gravity mainly in @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "indeed the structures of neutron and quark stars have recently been investigated by @xcite through the deviation of the mass - radius diagrams for power - law and exponential type correction from the teleparallel theory gravity by considering some equations of state . in this paper , we focus our attention on the study of these stars in particular the neutron stars by investigating the effects of strong magnetic fields in the framework of @xmath0 gravity . note that such studies have been performed in the so - called @xmath6 theory of gravity where interesting result have been found @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize here that neutron stars are observed as several classes of self - gravitating systems @xcite .",
    "the structure of neutron stars and the relation between the mass and the radius are determined by equations of state ( eos ) of dense matter . moreover ,",
    "the maximal mass of neutron star is still an open question .",
    "recent observations allow to estimate this limit at least as @xmath7 .",
    "it exits some well - measured limits according to several observational data on the pulsars and massive neutron stars : there are @xmath8 for pulsars psr j@xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 for pulsars j@xmath11 @xcite , @xmath8 for vela x-@xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 for @xmath14u@xmath15@xcite , @xmath16 for j@xmath17b @xcite .",
    "several works with different approaches show that the mass limit of neutron star can increase : larger hyperon - vector couplings with stiffness of the eos @xcite , model with chiral quark - meson coupling @xcite ,    the quark - meson coupling model which naturally incorporates hyperons @xcite and others .",
    "however , it has been shown in the literature that ultrastrong magnetic field affected considerably the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron - star matter and consequently could lead to the increase of the maximal mass limit of these stars @xcite . in order to explain this fact ,",
    "various models of dense nuclear matter in presence of strong magnetic fields have been considered such as models with hyperons and quarks , and model with interacting @xmath18 gas .",
    "it has also been performed that the landau quantization leads to the softening of the eos for matter but account for contributions of magnetic field into pressure and density .    in this paper",
    ", we present the models of neutron star for simple eos in the ultrastrong magnetic field via the @xmath0 gravity . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it is clearly shown that the structure of a magnetized neutron star will be mostly affected by contributions from the magnetic field stress @xmath19 mev f@xmath20 which greatly exceeds the matter pressure @xmath21 at all relevant densities for @xmath22 .",
    "having in hand such fundamental result and through a perturbative approach , one obtains that the maximal mass limit of neutron stars can increase under an ultrastrong field magnetic .",
    "we consider two corrections of the teleparallel theory ( quadratic and cubic corrections ) and find that the parameter of correction plays an important role in this analysis .",
    "the deviation of mass - radius from teleparallel theory appears clearly in the case of cubic corrections .",
    "our investigation through perturbative approach shows that in the case of null magnetic field , the mass of neutron stars can increase as it was predicted by @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we make some reviews on the teleparallel theory via its equivalence to gr and its modified version , the so - called @xmath0 gravity . in sec.iii , we present the tov equations and its perturbative versions .",
    "strong magnetic field effect on the dense matter in the framework of the relativistic mean field has been described in the sec.iv .",
    "our main results have been presented in the sec.v and the conclusions in sec.vi .",
    "in teleparall , equivalent of general relativity , as in general relativity , the structure of space - time is represented by a manifold @xmath23 . at every point @xmath24 in the local coordinate chart @xmath25 , the tangent space @xmath26 at @xmath27",

    "this also comes from the fact that all @xmath55 dimensional parallelisable manifold has a tangent space which can be decomposed in the direct product of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "note that the frame field depends only on the affine structure of the manifold and hence _ a priori _ has any relation with the metric .",
    "actually , we describe the frames with the metric by equipping the @xmath63 space with the minkowskian metric @xmath64 such as @xmath65 this also means that on the manifold @xmath61 , we arbitrary choose a frame @xmath59 at each point namely locally on some open chart @xmath66 .",
    "this approach can be extended by parallelisability .",
    "one can define the metric @xmath67 on the open chart @xmath68 by    @xmath69    which shows the orthonormality on the tetrad .",
    "it is important to notify here that for the @xmath70 dimension gravity , the previous results hold according to the steenrod theorem : all @xmath34 dimensional and orientable manifold is parallelisable @xcite .",
    "thus a @xmath14-dimensional spacetime with orientable spatial section is also parallelisable . to put it slightly differently , if any spatial slice of spacetime is an orientable @xmath34-manifold ( and as such parallelizable ) with initial data that can be propagated uniquely in time , in the manner of @xmath71 decomposition of @xmath72 @xcite , then the entire spacetime is parallelizable .",
    "we also emphasize here from geroch theorem @xcite that a non - compact 4-dimensional lorentzian manifold m admits a spin structure if and only if it is parallelisable .",
    "+ let introduce @xmath73 , the weitzenbck connection @xcite defined by @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "the teleparallelism condition on the tetrads imposes @xmath76 which allows to define the coefficients of the connection as @xmath77 the coefficients defined in ( [ con ] ) is for an unique connection @xcite which , at each vector field @xmath78 , gives rise to parallelisation on @xmath61 , assuming of course that @xmath61 is parallelisable .",

    "another important tensor emerging from the use of the weitzenbck connection is the contortion which shows the difference between the weitzenbck connection and the levi - civita connection @xcite according to    @xmath86    or in the equivalent form as    @xmath87    where @xmath88 represents the coefficient of levi - civita connection . in order to show that the both connections make the same description of spacetime namely , prove that the teleparallel theory based on the weitzenbck connection is equivalent to gr using the levi - civita connection , we recall here the action of einstein - hilbert gr as @xmath89 with @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is the ricci scalar curvature coming from the levi - civita connection .",

    "frequently the magnetic field is expressed in units of the critical field @xmath223 , so that @xmath224 . but in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is clearly shown that the structure of a magnetized neutron stars will be mostly affected by contributions from the magnetic field stress @xmath19 mev f@xmath20 which greatly exceeds the matter pressure @xmath21 at all relevant densities for @xmath22 .",
    "we will use this result in our present work in order to investigate the effects of strong magnetic field on the mass - radius relation of neutron via the corrections of teleparallel .",
    "the effect of strong magnetic field has been developed in other kind of modified theories of gravity , namely the so called @xmath6 gravity @xcite . in our case",
    ", we also investigate the effect of the strong magnetic field on some observables features of neutron stars such as the mass - radius relation . in order to reach our goal , we consider the perturbative tov equations and the equation of state described in the previous section . for simplicity we make use of the result from ref .",

    ", we can note the following features for @xmath228 : the mass of the neutron stars is very affected by @xmath148 and can differ from the one in teleparallel .",
    "but for the two figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] which correspond to the large magnetic fields ,    the maximal mass of neutron stars increases and can exceed the limit value @xmath229 as it is notified in @xcite .",
    "this can lead to stable configuration of neutron stars @xcite . in this case of large magnetic field ,",
    "the deviation from the teleparallel is very appreciable in the case of figure [ fig2 ] and it requires a large value of the coefficient of corrections .",
    "the cubic corrections of teleparallel can be expressed by the model : @xmath230 which is also power - law function .",
    "the mass - radius relation according to this model has practically the same behaviours as in the case of quadratic corrections .",
    "the interesting feature which appears here is that the deviation from teleparallel is very clearly appreciable ( see figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig4 ] , the mass of neutron stars increases as the correction parameter @xmath148 evolves contrarily to the case of figure [ fig5 ] .    in general for the two models",
    ", we can note that the mass of neutron stars increases due to the very strong magnetic field which leads to the maximum mass configuration of stars as shown in @xcite .",
    "these values should be able to describe highly massive compact stars , such as the one associated to the millisecond pulsars psr b1516 @xmath231 02b @xcite , and the one in psr j1748 - 2021b @xcite if the existence of these stellar objects is confirmed . due to the magnetic field pressure ,",

    "we have in the first time revisited the geometrical equivalence between teleparallel theory and gr .",
    "the second step of this work concerns the establishing of tov equations in the framework of @xmath0 gravity before proceeding to its perturbation .",
    "we then recall according to the literature , the equation of the state describing dense matter in magnetic field using a model with baryon octet interacting .",
    "this leads to the matter equation of state .",
    "we assume two cases of corrections to teleparallel in order to solve numerically the perturbed equations and find out the evolution of the mass - radius relation and the deviation from teleparallel by considering the very strong magnetic field .",
    "our investigations show that the mass of neutron stars increase even in the case of null magnetic field where the correction parameter @xmath148 plays an important role . for the both quadratic and cubic corrections ,",
    "the mass of neutron stars can increase and the deviation from tele - parallel is very appreciable in the case of cubic corrections .",
