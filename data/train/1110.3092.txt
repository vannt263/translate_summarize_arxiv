    "* dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) simulation of healthy ( red ) and malaria - infected ( blue ) red blood cells ( rbc)*. the membrane of each rbc is represented by 500 dpd particles [ 1 ] .",
    "the blood plasma is also represented by dpd particles , shown as spheres colored by the local velocity magnitude .",
    "the ensemble average velocity is computed using window proper orthogonal decomposition , and is presented at several slices along the computational domain .",
    "* patient - specific domain of major brain arteries including circle of willis , internal carotid , vertebral and communicating arteries ; as well as large aneurysm*. at the four inlets patient - specific inflow boundary conditions have been imposed . at the multiple outlets",
    "the pressure is regulated by the rc boundary conditions [ 2 ] .",
    "the main flow characteristics are @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "computational domain is subdivided into four overlapping patches composed of about @xmath2 spectral elements . in each element",
    "the solution is approximated with six - order polynomial expansion .",
    "instantaneous velocity field is represented by streamlines , which also highlight the presense of an unsteady vortex inside the aneurysm .",
    "* platelet aggregation at the wall of the aneurysm*. simulation is performed using a coupled continuum - atomistic solver .",
    "the continuum solution in the macroscopic domain is obtained by nektar , while the atomistic solution inside 4 @xmath3 microscopic subdomain is computed by dpd - lammps .",
    "the velocity boundary conditions for the microscopic domain are updated every 200 time - steps using data simultaneousely computed by nektar .",
    "platelet aggregation simulations have been performed on up to 190,740 processors of cray xt5 at ornl and on up to 131,072 processors of bluegene / p at anl .",
    "platelet aggregation modeled is described in [ 3 ] .",
    "more information on the coupled continuum - atomistic solver will be provided in the sc11 gordon bell prize finalist paper [ 4 ] .        [ 3 ] i. v. pivkin , p. d. richardson and g. e. karniadakis .",
