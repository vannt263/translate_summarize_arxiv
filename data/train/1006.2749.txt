    "the category of finite - dimensional representations of a lie algebra is endowed with a natural contravariant involution @xmath8 where @xmath9 indicates dual space . for categories of infinite - dimensional modules @xmath10 is never an involution as @xmath11 .",
    "this is why one usually looks for a `` restricted dual '' or a `` continuous dual '' which might still yield a contravariant involution on a given category of infinite - dimensional modules . in this paper",
    "we study two categories of infinite - dimensional modules of certain infinite - dimensional lie algebras and show , in particular , that there exists an interesting category @xmath3 of infinite - dimensional representations on which the functor ( 1 ) of algebraic dualization is well - defined and preserves the property of a module to be of finite loewy length .",
    "more precisely , we study representations of locally finite lie algebras , i.e. of direct limits of finite - dimensional lie algebras",
    ". there are three well - known classical simple locally finite lie algebras @xmath12 , each of them being defined by an obvious direct limit .",
    "none of these lie algebras admits non - trivial finite - dimensional representations , and instead one studies integrable representations ( the definition see in section 2 below ) .",
    "however , the category of integrable @xmath13-modules is vast ( and `` wild '' in the technical sense ) , so it is reasonable to look for interesting subcategories .",
    "one subcategory we study is the category of integrable weight modules with finite - dimensional weight spaces , and this is obviously an analog of the category of finite - dimensional representations of a classical finite - dimensional lie algebra .",
    "it is less obvious that for @xmath14 this category contains some rather interesting simple modules which are not highest weight modules .",
    "the first main result of this paper is the proof of the semisimplicity of this category : an extension of hermann weyl s semisimplicity theorem to the classical lie algebras @xmath15 .",
    "the above category is clearly not the only reasonable generalization of the category of finite - dimensional representations , as for instance it does not contain the adjoint representation .",
    "indeed , note that the adjoint representation has an infinite - dimensional weight space , the cartan subalgebra itself . on the other hand ,",
    "the adjoint representation is naturally a simple tensor module as defined in [ ps ] .",
    "more generally , we define the category @xmath3 for @xmath16 simply as the largest category of integrable @xmath13-modules which is closed under algebraic dualization and such that every object has finite loewy length . this category is a ( non - rigid ) tensor category with respect to the usual tensor product .",
    "the second main contribution of the present paper is the study of the category @xmath3 . in particular , we study injectives in @xmath3 and compute the ext@xmath6 s between simple modules .",
    "we also give an alternative characterization of @xmath3 by proving that an integrable @xmath13-module is an object of @xmath7 if and only if it has finite loewy length and admits only finitely many non - isomorphic simple subquotients each of which is a submodule of a suitable finite tensor product of natural and conatural modules .",
    "finally , we describe a certain subcategory @xmath7 of @xmath3 as the unique minimal abelian full subcategory of the category of integrable modules which contains a non - trivial module and is closed under tensor product and algebraic dualization",

    "let now @xmath656 denote the injective homomorphism induced by @xmath648 .",
    "then it is obvious that @xmath657 for any @xmath658 . by corollary [ brick ] , we have @xmath659 .",
    "hence @xmath660 is an isomorphism , i.e. @xmath648 is surjective .      by lemma [ injhull ] we know that the loewy length of @xmath610 is at most @xmath661 .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath135 is a non - trivial extension of @xmath539 by @xmath417 .",

    "assume that @xmath461 .",
    "it is sufficient to prove the existence of @xmath679 for a semisimple @xmath4 since then the general case follows from lemma [ injhull ] . without loss of generality",
