    "ever since the successful fabrication of gated two dimensional ( 2d ) graphene monolayers and the measurement of the density - dependent ( i.e. , gate voltage tuned ) conductivity of 2d chiral graphene carriers @xcite , transport properties of 2d graphene layers have been of great interest to both experimentalists @xcite and theorists @xcite .",
    "much of the early interest focused on the important issue of the scattering mechanisms limiting the low - temperature conductivity and the associated graphene `` minimal conductivity '' at the charge neutral ( dirac ) point .",
    "one of the dominant low - temperature scattering mechanisms @xcite in graphene is that due to screened coulomb scattering by unintended charged impurities invariably present in the graphene environment , e.g. the substrate ( and the substrate - graphene interface ) . by reducing the concentration of charged impurities in suspended graphene @xcite , very high quality samples ( with mobilities exceeding 200,000 @xmath1/vs which is an order of magnitude improvement over graphene samples fabricated on a substrate )",
    "have been made .",
    "there has been substantial recent experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite work on both density and temperature dependence of graphene carrier transport properties .",
    "much of the observed temperature dependent graphene properties have been theoretically studied in the context of the phonon scattering mechanism @xcite which freezes out at low temperatures .",
    "our theoretical work presented in the current paper considers temperature dependent graphene transport arising entirely out of electronic mechanisms without any phonon effects .",
    "our motivation is partially theoretical , but we are also motivated by the intriguing recent experimental observation @xcite of an increasing graphene conductivity with increasing temperature at the dirac point , which obviously can not be explained by phonons since phonon scattering necessarily leads to an increasing carrier resistivity with increasing temperature ( as is seen in graphene at higher carrier densities away from the dirac point ) .",
    "our theoretical motivation for studying temperature dependent graphene transport associated with purely electronic mechanisms arises from the extensively studied 2d metal - insulator - transition phenomena @xcite in semiconductor - based 2d semiconductor systems .",
    "the low - temperature resistivity measurements in conventional semiconductor based 2d systems ( e.g. si inversion layers , gaas heterostructures and quantum wells ) report the observation of an anomalously strong temperature dependent ( showing an effective metallic behavior ) 2d conductivity @xcite . in conventional 2d structures",
    "long - range charged impurity scattering dominates low - temperature ohmic transport and it is known that the temperature dependent screening of charged impurity scattering gives rise to the unusual strong temperature dependent metallic behavior at low carrier densities .",
    "@xcite since in gated graphene layers , which are similar to 2d electron systems in confined semiconductor structures , the charged impurities are also the main scattering mechanism , one can expect a strong temperature dependent conductivity .",
    "however , a very weak ( less than 5% ) temperature dependent conductivity from 1k to room temperature has been reported for low mobility graphene samples .",
    "@xcite    recently , with more careful measurements in high mobility samples a strong temperature dependence of carrier conductivity is reported .",
    "@xcite we first summarize the key experimental features of the measured carrier transport in 2d high mobility graphene sample .",

    "the effective metallic behavior is characterized by a drop in the temperature dependent resistivity , @xmath7 , as @xmath8 . at low density , near the charge neutral dirac point",
    ", the conductivity of graphene shows a pronounced non - metallic @xmath9-dependence ( i.e. , the increase of resistivity with decreasing @xmath9 ) . in this paper",
    ", we propose a possible theoretical explanation for ( at least a part of ) the observed temperature dependent conductivity in graphene at low carrier density .",
    "we emphasize that the apparent insulating behavior near the dirac point can not be explained by phonons .",
    "our explanation is quantitative , microscopic , and physically motivated .",
    "our theory is based on an essential assumption , that is , transport is dominated by charged impurity scattering centers ( with a density of @xmath10 per unit area ) which are randomly distributed in the graphene environment .",
    "we use the finite temperature drude - boltzmann theory to calculate the ohmic resistivity of the graphene electrons .",
    "@xcite we calculate the graphene conductivity in the presence of randomly distributed coulomb impurity charges near the surface with the electron - impurity interaction being screened by the 2d graphene carriers in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the screened coulomb scattering is the only scattering mechanism in our theory .",
    "we also compare critically the 2d graphene situation with the corresponding situation in the conventional parabolic 2d electron gas systems .",
    "we neglect all phonon scattering effects in this calculation , which have been considered recently finding that acoustic phonon scattering gives rise to a linear resistivity with temperature.@xcite given that 2d graphene is essentially a weakly interacting system with effective @xmath11 for graphene on sio@xmath12 , a constant independent of carrier density ( @xmath13 here is just the effective fine structure constant ) , we expect our rpa - boltzmann theory to be a quantitatively and qualitatively accurate description of graphene transport for all practical purposes .",

    "ii the boltzmann transport theory is presented to calculate temperature dependent 2d graphene conductivity . in section iii",
    "we study the temperature dependent screening function .",
    "section iv presents the results of the calculations .",
    "we conclude in section v with a discussion .",
    "the low - energy band hamiltonian for graphene is well - approximated by a two dimensional ( 2d ) dirac equation for massless particles , the so - called dirac - weyl equation,@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the 2d fermi velocity , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are pauli spinors and @xmath18 is the momentum relative to the dirac points .",

    "the matrix element of the scattering potential of randomly distributed screened impurity charge centers in graphene is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the fourier transform of the 2d coulomb potential in an effective background lattice dielectric constant @xmath62 .",

    "then , the energy dependent scattering time @xmath68 for our model is given in the leading - order theory by @xmath69 the factor @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scattime ] ) weights the amount of backward scattering of the electron by the impurity .",
    "the @xmath70 factor , associated with the vertex correction by impurity interaction in the diagrammatic calculation of the conductivity , is always present in transport theories involving elastic scattering . in normal parabolic 2d systems",
    "the factor @xmath70 obviously favors large angle scattering events , in particular , the @xmath71 to @xmath72 backward scattering . however , in graphene the large angle scattering is also suppressed due to the wave function overlap factor @xmath73 , which arises from the sublattice symmetry peculiar to graphene . the energy dependent scattering time in graphene",
    "thus gets weighted by an angular contribution factor of @xmath74 , which suppresses both small - angle scattering and large - angle scattering contributions in the scattering rate . therefore , @xmath75 is insensitive to both small and large angle scatterings .",
    "in fact , the dominant contribution to @xmath75 comes from @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath77 scattering , which is equivalent to the @xmath78 `` right - angle '' scattering in contrast to the @xmath79 back scattering in ordinary 2d systems .",
    "the importance of the right - angle scattering in 2d graphene has not been emphasized in the literature .",
    "we note that there are two independent sources of temperature dependent resistivity in our calculation .",
    "one comes from the energy averaging defined in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) , and the other is the explicit temperature dependence of the finite temperature dielectric function @xmath0 which produces a direct temperature dependence through screening in eq .",

    "for example , if the relaxation time @xmath80 is given by a function of energy @xmath82 as @xmath83 , then we have @xmath84 .",
    "we describe the details of energy dependent scattering time and temperature dependent scattering time in the following sections .    before concluding this basic transport theory section of this paper we want to point out the key qualitative similarities and differences in the transport theory between 2d graphene and 2d semiconductor based parabolic 2d systems ( e.g. si mosfets , gaas heterostructures and quantum wells , sige - based 2d structures ) which have been studied extensively over the last thirty years @xcite .",
    "first , the formal boltzmann theory for carrier transport is the same in both systems except for the different angular factor , @xmath70 in the conventional 2d systems and @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) for 2d graphene .",
    "formally the two theories become identical for isotropic @xmath86-wave disorder , where the scattering potential is zero - range ( i.e. a constant in the wave vector space)@xcite .",
    "but , for the long - range coulomb disorder associated with scattering by random charged impurities in the environment , which is of interest in this work , the factor @xmath70 and @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) would have very different implications @xcite .",
    "of course , the explicit differences between 2d graphene and 2d parabolic systems in the density of states @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( 8) and the dielectric function @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) would lead to different temperature dependent conductivities in these two systems even if the angular factors were the same .",
    "the importance of @xmath78-scattering in graphene versus @xmath79-scattering in the ordinary 2d semiconductor systems in determining the transport properties , most particularly the temperature dependent conductivity , can not be overemphasized .",
    "for example , theoretical approaches to understanding the temperature dependent graphene conductivity using the impurity - induced friedel oscillations @xcite ( i.e. the @xmath79 behavior of the polarizability function ) immediately run into problem , as mentioned above , because unlike the regular 2d systems , @xmath78-scattering , not the @xmath79-scattering , dominates graphene transport .",
    "in fact , while both approaches lead to the prediction of weak temperature - dependent conductivity in graphene at low temperatures in contrast to regular 2d system , the @xmath79 friedel oscillation approach predicts @xcite a weak insulating temperature dependence for high - density extrinsic 2d graphene whereas the @xmath78 approach based on the screening theory used in the current work leads to a weak metallic graphene conductivity at low @xmath88 .",
    "this is a qualitative and conceptual difference , which applies whenever screening is important in determining graphene transport properties .",
    "the important temperature dependence of the scattering time @xmath75 arises from the temperature dependent screening in eq .",

    "the weak temperature dependence of graphene resistivity can be explained by the weak temperature dependence of the screening function .",

    "the most important qualitative difference is that the leading low - temperature ( @xmath203 ) correction to the resistivity @xmath208 in ordinary 2d ( graphene ) systems is linear ( quadratic ) in temperature  both are metallic corrections , i.e. @xmath217 $ ] in ordinary 2d systems and @xmath218 $ ] in graphene .",
    "this important qualitative difference , of course , leads to a huge quantitative difference between the two systems in the sense that graphene manifests much weaker temperature - dependent resistivity than 2d semiconductor systems at low @xmath88 .",
    "this difference in the quantitative temperature dependence of the low - temperature resistivity ( i.e. linear and strong in 2d systems , and quadratic and weak in graphene ) is further exacerbated by the fact that the fermi temperature in extrinsic graphene tends to be very high ( e.g. @xmath219 for @xmath220 in graphene ) compared with that of semiconductor - based parabolic 2d systems ( e.g. @xmath221 for @xmath222 in si mosfets ) , leading to much smaller effective values of @xmath88 in gated graphene in the extrinsic high - density regime .    the above discussion and the results of fig .",

    "taking into account that @xmath223(graphene)@xmath224k , where @xmath225 is the 2d graphene carrier density measured in units of @xmath226 , it is obvious that the screening contribution to the temperature dependent conductivity of graphene , going as @xmath183 , would be extremely small in the @xmath227k regime except in the intrinsic regime where @xmath228 .",

    "the fact that this apparent insulating temperature dependence is observed @xcite only at low densities is further evidence in support of the screening scenario .",
    "= 2.5 in    one puzzling issue in this context is that our theory would predict a metallic @xmath144 for @xmath203 independent of carrier density except that the @xmath237 regime necessitates going to lower temperatures at lower densities .",
    "this seems not to be experimentally observed @xcite near the low - density dirac regime where an insulating temperature dependence is reported at low gate voltage down to the lowest temperatures .",
    "one reason for the absence of the metallic regime could be the suppression of the temperature dependent screening by impurity scattering induced level broadenings as was originally suggested by one of us some time ago @xcite . essentially , for @xmath238 , where @xmath239 is the so - called dingle temperature associated with the impurity - scattering induced level broadening @xmath240 , the temperature dependence of screening is suppressed by scattering effects .",
    "such a broadening - induced suppression of the temperature dependence of the screening function @xmath66 for @xmath241 can be theoretically incorporated in our conductivity calculations , and we discuss below such a scenario .",
    "it is clear that this broadening - induced suppression of the temperature dependence of screening will strongly suppress the metallic behavior of the conductivity for @xmath242 , and may qualitatively explain the experimentally observed insulating @xmath144 near the dirac point @xcite .    in fig [ rho_d ]",
    "we show the level broadening effects on @xmath243 . without level broadening (",
    "i.e. , @xmath244 ) the low temperature metallic behavior of resistivity is quadratic .",
    "however , the quadratic temperature dependence is cut off at low temperatures due to the rounding of the sharp corner in the 2d screening function by impurity scattering effects at very low temperatures @xmath245 , and the explicit temperature dependence of @xmath246 is suppressed .",

    "we have developed a detailed microscopic transport theory for 2d graphene conductivity at finite temperatures , assuming charged impurities as the dominant source of scattering and neglecting all other scattering sources ( e.g. phonons ) .",
    "we find that the temperature dependant resistivity induced by the temperature dependent screening is non - monotonic .",
    "it shows metallic behavior at low temperatures , but insulating behavior at high temperatures .",
    "the quadratic temperature dependent correction to @xmath208 at low temperatures is suppressed by level broadening effects which give rise to an effective linear temperature dependence of resistivity for @xmath117 .",
    "even though our drude - boltzmann transport theory explains both the high density metallic behavior and the low density insulating behavior as observed experimentally , we emphasize that the theory is strictly quantitatively valid only in the relatively high density regime where our linear screening theory based on the homogeneous carrier density model is valid . in the low - density regime , near the dirac point , it is well established that the graphene layer becomes spatially inhomogeneous with random charged impurity induced electron - hole puddles dominating the carrier density profile @xcite . in this low - density inhomogeneous regime our linear screening theory , based on an average density approximation , is at best of qualitative validity .",
    "it is , therefore , not surprising that , although we obtain a reasonable quantitative agreement with experiment in the high - density regime away from the dirac point where @xmath208 manifests very weak metallic temperature dependence , our results are only in qualitative agreement with the experimental data in the low - density dirac point regime where @xmath208 shows an insulating temperature dependence @xcite .",
    "loosely speaking , our screening theory is valid for @xmath253 so that the impurity - induced puddle formation is weak , but we believe that the qualitative behavior predicted by our theory has rather broad validity .",
    "indeed , our theory provides a plausible qualitative explanation for the observed @xcite weakly metallic and strongly insulating behaviors of the temperature dependent resistivity at high and low densities respectively .",
    "we conclude by pointing out that we have only considered in this work the contribution to the temperature dependent graphene conductivity arising from screened coulomb disorder , including both the explicit temperature dependence of the screening function and the implicit temperature dependence due to the thermal energy averaging in the boltzmann theory .",
    "there are other scattering mechanisms contributing to the temperature dependence of carrier transport properties , most notably , phonon scattering which we have studied elsewhere @xcite . when the temperature dependence of the conductivity is weak , matthiessen s rule should apply giving @xmath254 , where @xmath255 , @xmath256 are respectively the graphene resistivity due to charged impurity scattering and phonon scattering .",
    "since @xmath256 is very strongly suppressed at low temperatures due to the well - known bloch - grneisen behavior , it is reasonable to expect that @xmath208 is dominated by @xmath255 , considered in this work , for @xmath257 depending on the carrier density .",
    "we note that @xmath256 due to phonon scattering is always monotonic in @xmath9 , and therefore the ` insulating ' temperature dependence of @xmath208 around the low - density dirac point can not arise from phonon scattering which would always produce a metallic @xmath256 increasing with increasing @xmath9 ( linearly at higher temperatures ) .",
    "it is , therefore , reasonable to conclude , as we do in this work , that the low-@xmath9 insulating behavior of graphene @xmath208 around the low - density dirac point , as observed experimentally in ref . [ ] , is a result of the high - temperature and low - density ( i.e. @xmath258 ) screened impurity scattering phenomenon discussed in this work .",
