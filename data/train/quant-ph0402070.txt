    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in atomic media is a quantum interference effect that results in a dramatic reduction of the group velocity of propagating probe field accompanied by vanishing absorption @xcite .",
    "as the quantum interference is usually very sensitive to the system parameters , various schemes exhibiting eit are attracting growing attention in view of their potential for significantly enhancing nonlinear optical effects .",
    "some of the most representative examples include slow - light enhancement of acusto - optical interactions in doped fibers @xcite , trapping light in optically dense atomic and doped solid - state media by coherently converting photonic excitation into spin excitation @xcite or by creating a photonic band gap via periodic modulation of the eit resonance @xcite , and nonlinear photon - photon coupling using n configuration of atomic levels @xcite .",
    "eit is based on the phenomenon of coherent population trapping @xcite , in which the application of two laser fields to a three - level @xmath0 system creates the so - called `` dark state '' , which is stable against absorption of both fields .",
    "dark states are also found in several other multilevel systems , one of them being four - level atoms interacting with three laser fields in tripod configuration .",
    "tripod atoms proved to be robust systems for `` engineering '' arbitrary coherent superpositions of atomic states @xcite using an extension of the well - known technique of stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite .",
    "parametric generation of light in a medium of tripod atoms , prepared in a certain coherent superposition of ground states , has been recently discussed in @xcite . in a related work , it was shown that enhanced nonlinear conversion between two laser pulses is attainable in a medium of @xmath0 atoms with spatially dependent ground state coherence @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we undertake a detailed study of propagation of a weak probe field through a medium of tripod atoms under the conditions of eit @xcite .",
    "we show that this system can support large magneto - optical rotation ( mor ) of the probe field polarization , accompanied by negligible absorption .",
    "it can therefore be used for ultra - sensitive optical magnetometry , with the sensitivity comparable to ( or better than ) other hitherto studied mor schemes @xcite . in contrast to these schemes , where the basic mechanism of nonlinear mor is the probe field induced coherence between the zeeman sublevels of atomic ground state @xcite , in our case the mor results from an extraordinary dispersion induced by a strong driving field in the eit regime .",
    "hence , by simply changing the intensity of the driving field , one could control the polarization rotation of the weak probe field .",
    "we note that an interferometric measurement of the magnetic field induced phase shift of the probe , subject to eit in the presence of a driving field , can yield sensitivity of the order of @xmath1 g @xcite . these studies and our present contribution reveal the significant potential for improving the sensitivity of faraday magnetometers to small magnetic fields as compared to conventional optical pumping magnetometers @xcite .",
    "another motivation for the present work is its relevance to the field of quantum information ( qi ) , which is attracting broad interest in view of its fundamental nature and its potentially revolutionary applications to cryptography , teleportation and computing @xcite . among the various qi processing schemes of current interest @xcite ,",
    "those based on photons @xcite have the advantage of using very robust and versatile carriers of qi .",
    "yet the main impediment towards their operation at the few - photon level is the weakness of optical nonlinearities in conventional media @xcite . as mentioned above",
    ", eit schemes with atoms having n configuration of levels have opened up a possibility of achieving enhanced nonlinear coupling of weak quantum fields at the single - photon level @xcite .",
    "the main hindrance of such schemes is the mismatch between the group velocities of the pulse subject to eit and its nearly - free propagating partner , which severely limits their effective interaction length @xcite .",
    "this drawback may be remedied by using an equal mixture of two isotopic species , interacting with two driving fields and an appropriate magnetic field , which would render the group velocities of the two pulses equal @xcite . here",
    "we propose an alternative , simple and robust approach which relies solely on an intra - atomic process , without resorting to two isotopic species and using just one driving field @xcite . in our scheme ,",

    "if the zeeman shift is small compared to the width of the eit window for both components of the probe , the absorption remains much smaller than the phase shift .",
