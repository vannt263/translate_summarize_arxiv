    "understanding interfacial phenomena at boundaries @xcite such as free surfaces of solids , or walls confining fluids , etc . ,",
    "is a topic of very high interest in current condensed matter research , driven by important applications , e.g. in micro- or nanofluidics , design of smart nanomaterials @xcite , etc .",
    "but it is also of fundamental interest as a problem of statistical mechanics .",
    "it is only the latter aspect that will be in our focus here , and hence we shall not deal here with wetting properties @xcite of specific materials , but rather consider wetting in the framework of a simple lattice model with nearest neighbor interactions and short - range forces due to the walls .    in this spirit , a large amount of work has been devoted to the study of simple ising models with boundary fields ; see e.g. @xcite for a review , and @xcite for some pertinent original work .",
    "spin reversal symmetry of this generic model implies that phase coexistence between the ordered phases with positive and negative spontaneous magnetization occurs at zero bulk field ( h=0 ) in the thermodynamic limit in the bulk ; the same holds still true when one considers a thin film of a finite thickness @xmath2 with surfaces at which boundary fields @xmath9 , @xmath10 act , provided one considers the antisymmetric situation @xmath11 , avoiding `` capillary condensation '' @xcite , i.e.  a shift of bulk coexistence to nonzero value of the bulk field due to boundary effects .",
    "the latter phenomena is interesting in its own right , e.g.  @xcite , and can also be studied in ising models choosing boundary fields @xmath12 , e.g.  @xcite , but this problem will not be followed up here .    in principle , the study of a wetting transition , where the boundary induces the formation of a macroscopically thick film of the phase that it prefers , coexisting with the other phase separated by an interface at a macroscopic distance from the boundary , requires to consider the limit @xmath13 . for any finite @xmath2 in the antisymmetric thin film geometry , or thin strip geometry ,",
    "when one considers @xmath3 dimensions rather than @xmath14 , one does not find a wetting transition , but rather the \" interface localization - delocalization transition ",
    "@xcite : for temperatures above @xmath15 but below the transition temperature @xmath16 of the bulk ising model , the interface between the coexisting phases is  delocalized \" , freely fluctuating in the center of the film ( or strip , respectively ) . here , by center we mean the plane ( or line ) ( @xmath17 , if we label the layers ( rows ) of the ising lattice parallel to the boundaries from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "however , for @xmath20 the interface is tightly bound , and hence `` localized '' , near one of the two boundaries .",
    "one predicts , however , that for large @xmath2 the transition temperature @xmath21 converges rapidly to the wetting transition temperature @xmath22 of the semi - infinite system @xcite , and this prediction is consistent with the numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "one aspect of wetting in the ising model that found great attention is the behavior near bulk criticality .",
    "one can show that for a second - order wetting transition the inverse function @xmath8 of @xmath22 behaves as @xcite    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the critical exponent that controls the scaling behavior with the surface field @xmath9 near bulk criticality @xcite .",
    "while @xmath24 in @xmath14 is only known approximately from numerical work , in @xmath3 abraham s exact solution for the ising model @xcite implies @xmath25 . note that on the square lattice with exchange constant @xmath26 between nearest neighbors the wetting transition occurs for @xmath27 given as the solution of    @xmath28\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\sinh ( 2 j / k_bt ) \\quad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the bulk critical point occurs at @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "an intriguing question is , of course , to study how the wetting behavior gets modified if the bulk phase transition changes its character .",
    "e.g. , a simple extension of the ising model is the blume - capel model @xcite , where each lattice site ( i ) can be in one of three states @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the hamiltonian becomes    @xmath33    where the `` crystal field '' @xmath34 controls the density of `` vacancies '' , i.e. sites with @xmath31 .    when @xmath35 vacancies are excluded , and the model reduces to the standard two state ising model , but when @xmath36 is of order unity , one has a nontrivial bulk phase diagram with a tricritical point @xcite at @xmath37 . for the square lattice ,",
    "this tricritical point occurs at @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( 5 ) .",
    "for @xmath40 the transition at @xmath41 is first order : two phases with opposite nonzero magnetization and the disordered phase ( with zero magnetization ) coexist .    from the universality principle",
    ", we expect that eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath25 would also hold in the second - order region of the blume - capel model for @xmath42 , but to our knowledge this assumption has not yet been tested . providing evidence for",
    "this assumption is one of the goals of the present paper .",
    "right at the tricritical point , however , the behavior should be different : instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) we now expect    @xmath43    where the exponent @xmath44 in @xmath14 is expected to be @xmath45 @xcite , the prediction due to landau mean - field theory , which is expected to hold in @xmath14 , apart from logarithmic corrections @xcite . while in @xmath3 the tricritical exponents in the bulk are not those of mean - field theory @xcite , for the ising model universality class to which the tricritial point of the blume - capel model belongs @xcite , they are exactly known from conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "e.g. in standard notation of critical exponents @xcite ) @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , etc . to our knowledge ,",
    "@xmath44 for this problem is not yet known , however .    when one considers the wetting transition for the part of the transition line @xmath50 that is first order @xmath51 , the wetting transition @xmath8 ends at this line at a nonzero value of the surface field ,    @xmath52    we expect that another power law will exist when @xmath34 approaches @xmath53 from below ,    @xmath54    but again we are not aware of predictions relating to this critical exponent @xmath55 .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath55 from numerical work is a very challenging task , because it requires to locate both the tricritical point and the wetting transitions with very high accuracy .",
    "finally , a very interesting aspect relates to the character of the interface between the coexisting phases with positive and negative magnetization , when one approaches the bulk phase transition : then interfacial adsorption of the third phase ( the disordered phase ) at the interface can occur @xcite .",
    "if we denote the coexisting bulk phases as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , approaching the bulk transition line in the second - order region one expects an interfacial wetting transition @xmath58 , where @xmath59 stands symbolically for an intruding layer of the disordered phase having predominantly states where @xmath31 dominates at the interface . to quantify this effect",
    "one considers the net adsorption defined by    @xmath60   \\quad , \\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is the total number of lattice sites , @xmath62 is the number of lattice sites per row parallel to the walls , @xmath63 is the kronecker symbol , and @xmath64 a statistical average in the presence of an interface ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) , while @xmath67 is the corresponding average for an equivalent system but without interfaces . since @xmath68 , one can conclude also that @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the interfacial tension for the considered interface .",
    "since for @xmath42 the bulk phase transition of the blume - capel model falls in the ising universality class , we know that @xmath71 with @xmath72 for the blume - capel model .",
    "writing @xmath73 , we find    @xmath74    thus if we define a divergence of interfacial adsorption via    @xmath75    we find @xmath76 for @xmath42 , i.e.  in the ising - like regime there should be no critical divergence of the net adsorption .",
    "however , right at the tricritical point , the behavior should be different : from @xmath77 as quoted above we conclude @xmath78 with @xmath79 for @xmath37 .",
    "this result is consistent with monte carlo results of selke et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for @xmath80 the transition of the blume - capel model is believed to be first order , and the emerging interfaces @xmath81 and @xmath82 remain sharp as @xmath83 . reducing the problem to interfaces in the solid - on - solid model , one can argue that eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) also holds in the first - order region , but @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "these considersations have been checked by early monte carlo work @xcite for interfaces between coexisting bulk phases , but no study in the context of wetting at external boundaries has as yet been performed , to our knowledge .    in the present work ,",
    "we wish to contribute filling this gap and study wetting behavior for the two - dimensional blume - capel model in the case of thin films for which surface fields at the boundaries act , as described in sec .",
    "2 . however , in order to do so , we have found it necessary to reconsider the simulation methodology for the study of critical wetting . in fact , by applying monte carlo simulations , we shall necessarily study finite systems , namely strips of width @xmath2 ( in @xmath85-direction ) and length @xmath62 ( in @xmath86-direction , where a periodic boundary condition acts ) . as a consequence , finite size effects matter , and",
    "hence in the next section we also shall give the background on the proper finite size scaling analysis of such simulation `` data '' , for the case of critical wetting in @xmath3 dimensions , taking into account that one deals there with an anisotropic critical phenomenon of a special character : if we consider the magnetization @xmath87 of the strip as the `` order parameter '' of the transition , its critical exponent @xmath88 .",
    "this fact does not seem to have found much attention in the previous monte carlo studies of critical wetting in @xmath3 @xcite . this revised methodology for the study of critical wetting , which is outlined in sec .",
    "2 , is another important result of our work .    sec .",
    "3 then presents our monte carlo results , which then are analyzed according to these concepts , and the wetting transitions are discussed for a variety of choices of @xmath34 , both cases @xmath42 , @xmath37 and @xmath89 will be considered .",
    "4 then discusses our result on interfacial adsorption , and sec .",
    "5 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian of the @xmath90-state blume - capel model @xcite where each lattice site @xmath91 carries a spin @xmath92 that can take on the values @xmath93 at a square lattice in a @xmath0 geometry , where periodic boundary conditions act in the @xmath86-direction ( where the lattice is @xmath62 rows long ) , while free boundary conditions are used in the @xmath85-direction , where boundary fields @xmath9 , @xmath10 act on the first and the last row .",
    "thus the hamiltonian is    @xmath94    here @xmath26 is the exchange constant between spins at nearest neighbor sites , which we take homogeneous throughout the system .",
    "thus , we disregard the possibility to take the exchange @xmath95 in the boundary rows different from the exchange @xmath26 in the interior of the system , that is frequently considered in studies of wetting phenomena in the ising model @xcite .",
    "the bulk field @xmath96 acts on all lattice sites , while the `` surface fields '' @xcite only act on the spins in the first ( 1 ) and last ( l ) row , where the free boundary conditions apply .",
    "we also specialize on the particular antisymmetric situation @xmath97 and consider the thermodynamic limit @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) before we consider the limit @xmath100 .",
    "then , the system undergoes two phase transitions : at the temperature @xmath50 the phase transition occurs from the disordered `` paramagnetic '' phase to the ordered `` ferromagnetic '' phase , where we have used the terminology of the ising model .",
    "taking the lattice spacing as our unit of length , the total number of spins is just the product of the linear dimensions of the system , @xmath101 .",
    "in fact , when we define the magnetization @xmath87 per lattice site as    @xmath102    its thermal expectation value @xmath103 for temperatures @xmath104 will be nonzero and positive in the considered limit .",
    "however , a second phase transition occurs at a lower temperature @xmath22 for small enough absolute values @xmath105 of the surface field : note that the surface field @xmath9 is oppositely oriented to the positive bulk field @xmath96 , but @xmath100 while @xmath9 , stays finite .",
    "thus , near @xmath106 the surface field stabilizes a macroscopically thick layer of negative magnetization near the lower boundary , where @xmath107 acts , separated by an interface from the bulk , where the magnetization is positive . at @xmath108 ,",
    "a transition occurs where this interface gets localized near the lower boundary : in the extreme case , the domain with negative magnetization disappears completely . in the ising model , which results from eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) as the limiting case @xmath109 , this wetting transition is second order throughout the regime @xmath110 .      for the semi - infinite system described above , the wetting transition is a singularity of the surface excess free energy @xmath112 , defined from standard decomposition of the total free energy into the bulk term and boundary terms , for @xmath13 , @xmath99    @xmath113    the singular part of this boundary free energy , also called `` wall tension '' or `` wall excess free energy '' @xcite , near @xmath22 is expected to satisfy a scaling behavior @xcite where @xmath114 ,    @xmath115    @xmath116 being a scaling function that we do not specify here .",
    "this is analogous to standard scaling in the bulk near @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath117 ,    @xmath118    in eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) , @xmath119 is the specific heat exponent , and the `` gap exponent '' @xmath120 is related to the standard exponents @xmath121 of the spontaneous magnetization @xmath122 and @xmath123 of the susceptibility @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath125 , @xmath126 are analogous exponents characterizing the singular behavior of the critical wetting transition in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "as always when one considers a critical phenomenon , a diverging correlation length exists . since wetting can be viewed as an `` interface unbinding '' transition @xcite when approached from below , it is natural to study the correlation function @xmath127 describing the correlation of fluctuations of the height of the contour @xmath128 separating the domain with negative magnetization near the lower boundary from the region with positive magnetization in the bulk . defining @xmath129 as @xmath130 , this yields    @xmath131    noting translational invariance in @xmath86-direction . by @xmath132",

    "we disregard here the problem that in general a nonlocal theory @xcite is required @xcite , since it does not change the following conclusions .",
    "capillary wave theory implies that @xmath146 , so there is no second independent critical exponent as in the bulk . for a more detailed reasoning to explain why for the case of critical wetting with short - range forces the exponent @xmath138 is zero in all dimensions , and",
    "hence there is a single independent critical exponent , we refer to the literature @xcite .",
    "remember that using hyperscaling relations @xmath147 and the scaling law @xmath148 one can express all static critical exponents just in terms of only two independent exponents @xmath149 and @xmath137 in the bulk @xcite .",
    "for critical wetting , in @xmath3 , there is only one independent critical exponent namely , @xcite",
    "@xmath150    and the hyperscaling relation for interfacial phenomena in @xmath3 dimensions @xmath151 @xcite then implies @xmath152 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) we then conclude that on a length scale @xmath86 the interface exhibits ( at @xmath153 ) a mean - square displacement also proportional to @xmath86 , while for @xmath154 one concludes that on the length scale @xmath141 the mean - square displacement in @xmath85-direction also is proportional to @xmath141 , while for @xmath155 the correlation @xmath156 .",

    "all above relations did refer to the case that we were considering the limits @xmath99 and @xmath13 first , and then consider the limits @xmath171 , @xmath172 near the wetting transition .",
    "while such an approach is natural in the context of analytic theories @xcite , it it not sufficient to understand simulations , where we wish to take these limits in reverse order .",
    "when @xmath2 is kept large but finite , it is clear that for temperatures above the wetting transition and @xmath173 there is no physical distinction between the domain with negative magnetization in the lower half of the system and the domain with positive magnetization in the upper half : previously , for the semi - infinite case , the positive magnetization in the bulk was singled out by taking the limit @xmath100 first , and then the positive boundary field @xmath10 for @xmath13 was irrelevant , while for @xmath2 finite it is critical to maintain the symmetry of the situation with respect to the sign of the magnetization for @xmath173 . as a consequence , we conclude that for the present situation there is no bulk magnetization to consider , and it rather is the total magnetization of the system or strictly speaking , its absolute value , which undergoes a transition from zero to a nonzero value when we cross the wetting transition temperature , and extrapolate simulation results towards @xmath13 .    as a consequence of this consideration ,",

    "the interpretation of the wetting transition in analogy to bulk critical phenomena , considering a particular way of taking the thermodynamic limit ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , is reminiscent of studies of filling transitions in double wedge @xcite or bipyramid @xcite geometries ; however , there the critical exponents are different . a useful consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq38 ] ) is that both @xmath211 and @xmath230 right at the critical wetting transition become completely independent of linear dimensions , but depend still on the constant @xmath231 , the generalized aspect ratio .",

    "the fact that for wetting transitions in @xmath3 for the choice @xmath232 a unique intersection point of @xmath233 versus @xmath133 curves occurs has been only noted previously @xcite in a study where long range boundary fields were applied , where @xmath234 holds @xcite , and hence the critical behavior is rather anomalous .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a schematic sketch where the typical excursion @xmath157 of the interface is still smaller than @xmath2 , by a factor of about 2.5 , and similarly @xmath141 is smaller than @xmath62 .",

    "the distribution of @xmath87 then is distinctly bimodal , and @xmath236 , since the interface is bound to the upper wall with the same probability as the lower wall .",
    "however , when @xmath133 approaches @xmath201 , the attractive force between the wall and the interface is compensated by the entropic repulsion , the excursions of the interface extend over the whole width @xmath2 , and then show a correlation over a lateral length @xmath237 . this interface configuration at @xmath22 then is selfsimilar , irrespective how large @xmath2 is chosen , as expected for critical phenomena .",
    "thus , the result @xmath88 must not be confused with a first - order wetting transition , where one would have a discontinuous change from a bound to an unbound state of the interface , rather than this continuous unbinding .    of course",
    ", it is of interest to ask how the behavior changes when one does not take the thermodynamic limit in this particular way where the generalized aspect ration @xmath185 is fixed , but rather choosing one of the linear dimensions large but finite , and varying only the magnitude of the other linear dimension .",
    "thus , if @xmath2 is kept fixed and one considers the limit @xmath99 , the system becomes quasi - one- dimensional .",
    "while mean - field theory would predict a sharp interface localization - delocalization transition in this limit @xcite , one expects that thermal fluctuations cause a rounding of this transition since the system is equivalent to a one - dimensional ising system @xcite , and this expectation has in fact been verified numerically @xcite .",
    "if instead we keep @xmath62 finite and increase @xmath2 , the growth of @xmath141 would be limited by the magnitude of @xmath62 , and hence also @xmath157 as well as the distance of the interface from one of the walls in the bound state would be limited by a value proportional to @xmath238 , irrespective of @xmath2 , while in the wet state its equilibrium position is at @xmath239 . as a consequence , data taken in such a way would appear as if the wetting transition were weakly of first order , which it is not .",
    "thus , we conclude that only the finite - size scaling analysis at constant generalized aspect ratio @xmath240 is the most useful choice .      in most of the numerical work ,",
    "we have chosen a particular value of this generalized aspect ratio , namely    @xmath241    of course , the value of the constant @xmath204 in principle is arbitrary , and the results on the location of @xmath22 and the critical exponents should not depend on this choice .",
    "our motivation for this choice was simple that it yields solutions for @xmath2 and @xmath62 which are both integer , as it must be on the lattice , and rather small : @xmath242 ; and @xmath243 .",

    "[ fig7]-[fig9 ] are just examples only , but representative for the general pattern of behavior . in any case , we do conclude that using such finite - size scaling analyses as presented here one can locate wetting transitions for two dimensional lattice models , such as the blume - capel model on the square lattice , with reasonable accuracy .    on view of the well - defined intersection points and the data collapse in all three quantities @xmath233 , @xmath249 and @xmath250 so far studied , figures [ fig3]-[fig5 ] and [ fig8]-[fig9 ] , respectively , it is worth to analyze the scaling behavior of the distribution function @xmath174 of the total magnetization given by equation ( [ eq27 ] ) .",
    "in fact , since one has @xmath210 the prefactor and the third scaling argument are constants .",
    "also , just at @xmath251 ( i.e. @xmath265 ) the second scaling argument vanishes due to the divergence of the correlation length @xmath141 , so that the distribution function depends on the generalized aspect ratio @xmath266 , equation ( [ eq43 ] ) , of the sample only .",
    "figures [ fig10 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show plots of @xmath174 versus @xmath87 as obtained by keeping @xmath267 and for the cases @xmath268 and @xmath269 , respectively .",
    "it might be expected that the curves of the probability distribution would be independent of @xmath34 , except for normalization corrections due to the different density of vacancies .",
    "since we found that the shape of the probability distribution depends sensitively on @xmath133 , it could be that the qualitative differences between the curves shown in figures [ fig10 ] ( a ) and ( b ) would be due to the uncertainties in the location of @xmath251 for the case @xmath269 .    on the other hand , by keeping the temperature , the crystal field , and the surface magnetic field just at the wetting transition point",
    ", we have measured the dependence of @xmath174 on the generalized aspect ratio , for the ising model , as shown in figure [ fig11 ] ( a ) . in that figure",
    "we choose @xmath270 while @xmath62 is varied .",
    "we recall the non - trivial shapes of the probability distributions that exhibit a single peak around @xmath271 for rather elongated samples ( i.e. @xmath272 ) , which monotonically crosses over to a bimodal distribution in the limit of more cubic samples ( i.e. @xmath273 ) . also , the generalized aspect ratio selected for our detailed monte carlo simulations ( @xmath267 ) , which can roughly be located within the crossover regime , exhibits not only the central peak , but it also shows the onset of growth of lateral shoulders close to @xmath274 . by using the distributions already shown in figure [ fig11 ] ( a ) we can also measure the dependence of the crossing points on the generalized aspect ratio of the sample ( figure  [ fig11 ] ( b ) ) . from this plot",
    "it follows that the suitable range of @xmath204 in order to obtain a reliable intersection point for both @xmath233 and @xmath250 in monte carlo simulations is rather narrow , say @xmath275 , and slightly broader for the case of @xmath249 . in order to be able to locate intersections with reasonable accuracy , it is advisable that the cumulant intersection is neither close to zero nor close to its maximun value ( @xmath276 ) .",
    "it is also reassuring to see that for no shape the distribution at the wetting transition resembles the shape expected for a first - order wetting transition , which would be three delta functions at zero and positive and negative spontaneous magnetization in the thermodynamic limit , and a distribution with three peaks of approximately gaussian shape in a large but finite system .",
    "the location of the wetting transitions as a function of two parameters , @xmath277 and @xmath36 , by determining well - defined intersection points still requires extensive computations and hence is a challenging task , figs .",
    "[ fig12 ] and  [ fig13 ] .",
    "since @xmath278 at @xmath279 decreases only rather slowly with increasing @xmath34 when one approaches @xmath53 , it obviously is very difficult to estimate the exponent @xmath44 ( eq .  ( [ eq4 ] ) numerically .",
    "in mean - field theory , supposed to be exact for @xmath280 we know that @xmath281 and @xmath45 @xcite ; while in @xmath14 dimensions numerical estimates yielded @xcite @xmath282 , and we know that in @xmath3 @xmath281 again .",
    "so , we see that the exponent @xmath24 never deviates much from its mean - field value , if at all . if we speculate the same observation to be true for @xmath44 , we would expect that the data in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] for @xmath283 vary as @xmath284 , which is not unreasonable .",
    "we also see that in the region where the transition in the bulk is first order , the wetting transition lines @xmath285 indeed end at nonzero values @xmath286 at the bulk transition line , and these values decrease as one approaches the tricritical point , qualitatively compatible with eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "thus , we can sketch the global wetting behavior as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ; however , it would be premature to attempt to estimate the exponent @xmath287 : our data are clearly too limited for this purpose , and we have not tried to extend our study , since we feel the incomplete knowledge on the precise location of the bulk tricritical point @xcite would hamper such a study .    as a final problem",
    "we consider the enrichment of vacancies at the interface between oppositely magnetized domains in the blume - capel model .",
    "this problem has been considered earlier by selke et al .",
    "@xcite for the case of free unbound interfaces , while here we consider the extension where the interfaces are confined between competing walls and may undergo a wetting ( interface unbinding ) transition .",
    "[ fig15 ] shows plots of the profiles of the vacancy density ( a ) and the magnetization ( b ) for a situation of incomplete wetting .",
    "one observes a clear enrichment of the vacancies in the interfacial region .",
    "the more the interface unbinds from the wall , the more the peak of the vacancy concentration moves away from the wall ( figs .",
    "[ fig15 ] a , b ) .",
    "note that for the low temperature shown , the magnetization in the bulk tends to @xmath288 , i.e.   the vacancy concentration inside the bulk is very small .",
    "close to the wetting transition , the interface gets detached from the wall , and then the interface is located in the middle of the strip , at @xmath289 on average .",
    "however , since the interface strongly fluctuates around its average position a straightforward measurement of the vacancy concentration profile would yield an almost horizontal flat curve across the strip .",
    "so we have defined a local coarse - graining of the interface , taking segments of length @xmath290 in the @xmath86-direction , and determining the local center of mass @xmath291 of the interface in each segment , we compute the vacancy distribution in each segment separately , relative to the center in each segment , and superpose the distributions from the individual segments such that their centers coincide . in this way one",
    "obtains vacancy profiles with a clear peak in the center of the strip in the wet phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig15]c ) . finally , when one reaches the phase boundary of the bulk , the disordered phase takes over in the film , and the vacancy concentration becomes ( almost ) unity in the system , except near the boundaries where the surface fields still stabilize layers of up - spins and down - spins , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig15]d ) .",
    "note , of course , that the details of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig15]c , d do depend on this coarse - graining length @xmath292 distinctly .",
    "this ambiguity that results depend on the coarse - graining is avoided when one simply computes the average fraction of vacancies in the system ( fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ) .",
    "while for @xmath105 chosen such that the system is in the incompletely wet state up to the transition in the bulk one sees also a clear jump in the vacancy concentration from a small value to almost unity when this transition in the bulk occurs , a much more rounded behavior is found when wetting at the boundaries occurs .",
    "the difference between incompletely wet states and completely wet states is even more pronounced when one studies the magnetization fluctuation : for wet states , this fluctuation is very large for almost all values of @xmath34 until the transition in the bulk is reached ( fig .",
    "[ fig16]b ) .",
    "this behavior is corroborated by an examination of snapshot pictures ( fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] ) .    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] shows an attempt to study the divergence of the interfacial adsorption , that we expect when we approach the bulk transition in the wet phase in the region where a first - order transition occurs .",
    "however , it is seen that the effective slope of these data changes slightly when the transition is approached , and also depends on @xmath293 . as a consequence",
    ", we must conclude that the asymptotic region where a universal exponent could be estimated has not been reached . in view of the strong and slow fluctuations of the interface",
    "it is not straightforward to cope with this problem .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a monte carlo study of the wetting behavior of the two - dimensional blume - capel model , mapping out the surface critical field @xmath294 where critical wetting occurs for a broad range of parameters @xmath133 and @xmath34 , both in the region where the transition of the blume - capel model in the bulk is of second order ( cf .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) and where is of first order ( cd . fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ) .",
    "we suggest that @xmath295 behaves as @xmath296 for all @xmath297 and @xmath298 for @xmath299 , and propose a qualitative phase diagram in the space of the three variables surface field ( @xmath300 ) , temperature ( @xmath133 ) and `` crystal field '' ( @xmath34 ) , as sketched in figure [ fig14 ] .",
    "thus , we present evidence for the universality of the surface critical exponent @xmath301 along the critical line of the blume - capel model .",
    "however , the precise crossover behavior in the inmediate vecinity of the tricritical point @xmath302 could not yet been studied : first of all , the location of this point needs to be more accurately determined , and also more powerful numerical methods ( rather than the straightforward monte carlo simulation method just using the metropolis algorithm ) would be required .",
    "already for the task that we did achieve we encountered the necessity to reconsider the finite - size scaling approach to the study of wetting transitions , sec .",
    "we propose that by using a procedure where the linear dimensions @xmath303 of the @xmath0 strip are varied such that the generalized aspect ratio @xmath304 is kept constant , cf .",
    "( [ eq43 ] ) , it is possible to analyze the data in full analogy to the study of a bulk phase transition , where one uses antisymmetric surface fields ( @xmath305 ) . then",
    ", simply the total magnetization @xmath87 in the system acts like as order parameter , but the appropiate critical exponent is @xmath210 . using the exactly known results for the ising model in the square lattice , which is the limit of the blume - capel model for @xmath306 , as a test case",
    ", our new finite - size scaling approach is nicely verified .",
    "note that @xmath307 and the critical exponents @xmath308 , @xmath309 , @xmath310 , @xmath311 , @xmath312 , and @xmath313 for critical wetting are known .",
    "then , we propose the corresponding exponents when one treats the transition not as a surface free energy singularity of the semi - infinite system in the limit where the bulk field @xmath96 tends to zero , but as a bulk singularity of the @xmath0 system for @xmath171 in the limit @xmath314 , @xmath315 constant .",
    "these expnents are @xmath316 , @xmath210 and @xmath317 .",
    "we have shown that these exponents satisfy all expected scaling relations and we have verified them from our simulations .",
    "use of this formulation of finite - size scaling for critical wetting in @xmath111 dimensions is a convenient and useful tool ; it would be interesting to study the extension of this method to @xmath318 dimensions where @xmath319 ( logarithmic growth ) and this extreme shape anisotropy that our method then requires makes the task obviously very much harder .    since the blume - capel model differs from the ising model by the presence of vacancies as a third component , it is interesting to ask to what extent vacancies get enriched at the interfaces in this situation of interfaces confined by walls .",
    "we found that the situation is fully analogous to interfaces between coexisting phases in the bulk : in the second - order region the interfacial adsorption is finite , while in the first - order region the predicted divergence of interfacial adsorption is found .    of course , there are many cases where by changing a parameter the order of a phase transition in the bulk changes from second to first order , and one can ask how wetting phenomena are affected .",

    "<S> the wetting transition of the blume - capel model is studied by a finite - size scaling analysis of @xmath0 lattices where competing boundary fields @xmath1 act on the first row or last row of the @xmath2 rows in the strip , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we show that using the appropriate anisotropic version of finite size scaling , critical wetting in @xmath3 is equivalent to a `` bulk '' critical phenomenon with exponents @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> these concepts are also verified for the ising model . for the blume - capel model </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the field strength @xmath7 where critical wetting occurs goes to zero when the bulk second - order transition is approached , while @xmath8 stays nonzero in the region where in the bulk a first - order transition from the ordered phase , with nonzero spontaneous magnetization , to the disordered phase occurs . </S>",
    "<S> interfaces between coexisting phases then show interfacial enrichment of a layer of the disordered phase which exhibits in the second order case a finite thickness only . </S>",
    "<S> a tentative discussion of the scaling behavior of the wetting phase diagram near the tricritical point also is given . </S>",
