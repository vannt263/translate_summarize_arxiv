    "type ia supernovae ( snia ) are deeply connected with many important frontiers of astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "they occur in all galaxy types and are major contributors to galactic chemical evolution , in particular of iron .",
    "they are very bright and , as high redshift distance indicators , play a critical role in establishing the modern cosmology paradigm @xcite .    however , there are major uncertainties regarding the nature of the snia progenitors and explosions . while it is established that most snia result from the thermonuclear explosion of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( wd ) near the chandrasekhar mass , the mechanism of mass gain remains debated . in the single - degenerate ( sd ) scenario",
    "the wd accretes mass from a companion star @xcite , while in the double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario the wd merges with another wd @xcite .",
    "in addition , although the main products are known , the basic mechanism of nuclear burning remains under debate .",
    "in deflagration the ignited flame propagates subsonically , while in detonation it propagates supersonically as a shock wave .",
    "there are combined models , as well as the possibility of detonation in the he layer of a sub - chandrasekhar wd .",
    "the difference between star formation and snia rates depends on what the snia progenitors are .",
    "the rate of snia following an episode of star formation depends on ( i ) the delay time , which describes the time required for a newly - formed snia progenitor to develop into a snia , and ( ii ) the production efficiency , which is the number of snia produced per @xmath9 of star formed .",
    "the sd and dd scenarios involve different progenitors and have different predictions for these quantities .",
    "although current predictions are comparable within uncertainties , improved information on the global delay - time distribution ( dtd ) and snia efficiency will discriminate between snia progenitor scenarios @xcite .",
    "it is well known from nuclear fusion modeling and optical light curve observations that each snia yields as much as 0.50.7 @xmath10 of radioactive @xmath11ni .",
    "the decay of @xmath11ni , via @xmath11co to stable @xmath11fe , provides the primary source of energy  in the form of nuclear gamma rays and energetic positrons that deposit much of their energy in the ejecta  that powers the snia optical display .",
    "initially , the gamma - rays are trapped , but as the snia ejecta expands and the matter density drops they start to escape , while the positrons remain largely trapped until much later times .",
    "the decline rates of the optical light curve show the timescales set by the decay of @xmath12 ( half life of 6 days ) and @xmath13 ( half life of 77 days ) .",
    "the detection of gamma rays that escape the ejecta is the key to resolving the central mysteries of snia @xcite .",
    "since gamma rays are more penetrating and their opacities are much simpler than those for optical photons , they offer a more straightforward and direct probe of the inner mechanisms of snia @xcite .",
    "the gamma ray flux allows the identification of radioactive material yield , and its time evolution allows tomography of the surrounding ejecta ; both quantities can be compared with model predictions . in a few cases of fortuitously nearby snia ,",
    "limits just above theoretical expectations have been set .",
    "no snia features have been seen in the cosmic gamma - ray background ( cgb ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "reliable knowledge of snia rates is essential to defining realistic prospects for gamma - ray detection , and new data make this possible .    in the first part of this paper",
    ", we investigate the cosmic snia rate and determine the delay of snia relative to their progenitor formation and the efficiency of forming snia ( section [ sec : progenitor ] ) .",
    "we use a large selection of star formation indicators with recent updates ( section [ sec : rate ] ) , as well as a comprehensive compilation of snia rate data ( section [ sec : ratedata ] ) .",
    "we study the effects of delay and efficiency using data over a substantial redshift range , and we discuss what our results reveal about the snia progenitors , i.e. , for sd and dd scenarios ( section [ sec : ratesynthesis ] ) .    in the second part of this paper , we bring in gamma rays as a probe of snia explosions and progenitors ( section [ sec : gamma ] ) .",
    "our analysis of the cosmic snia rate plays a critical role in determining the gamma - ray detection prospects .",
    "we first review the gamma - ray emission for several benchmark snia models ( section [ sec : gammaemission ] ) .",
    "we determine the snia contribution to the cgb using our updated cosmic snia rate inputs ( section [ sec : cgb ] ) .",
    "we derive snia rates from supernova catalogs , and joining them with cosmic snia rates , we investigate the local snia rate with a higher accuracy than previously possible ( section [ sec : catalog ] ) .",
    "we revisit the status of gamma - ray observations in light of our updated local snia rate ( section [ sec : localpast ] ) .",
    "finally , we give new results on the excellent gamma - ray detection prospects for nearby snia and the physics that this will probe ( section [ sec : local ] ) .",
    "we close with a summary of our findings ( section [ sec : summary ] ) . throughout , we adopt the standard @xmath14cdm cosmology with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 .",
    "comparing the cosmic star formation rate and the high redshift snia rate of the _ goods _ fields suggests a dtd tightly distributed around 34 gyr @xcite . however , small snia statistics , uncertain dust corrections , and the uncertain star formation rate at high redshift complicate studies of the dtd in this range @xcite .",
    "we perform a new investigation of the snia rate by adopting both greatly updated star formation rate data ( section [ sec : rate ] ) and snia rate data ( section [ sec : ratedata ] ) . in particular , we focus on the low redshift range , which provides a complementary test to previous studies . by comparing the calculation to observations , we determine the global dtd and snia efficiency , and discuss implications for snia progenitors ( section [ sec : ratesynthesis ] ) .",
    "the snia rate at a given time corresponds to the stellar birthrate at earlier epochs , convolved with the dtd , normalized by the efficiency of forming snia progenitor systems .",
    "the normalization is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the snia formation efficiency , @xmath21 is the initial mass function , and the integration is performed over the mass range for snia progenitors . unless otherwise stated , we present all results for the salpeter initial mass function ; our results on the snia rate do not strongly depend on this choice because the snia progenitor mass range is sufficiently high .",
    "assuming @xmath22 and @xmath23 do not vary with space and time , @xmath24 is a constant representing the number of snia produced per @xmath9 of stars formed , so that @xmath25 = \\eta \\int_{t_{10}}^{t_c } \\phi(t_c - t'_c ) \\dot{\\rho}_\\star[z(t'_c ) ] \\ , dt'_c,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the dtd , its argument is the time difference between progenitor star formation and snia explosion , @xmath27 is the star formation rate , and the integration is performed over cosmic time from @xmath28 , the age of the universe when the first stars were being formed , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath26 is normalized such that its integral over the entire delay time range is unity .",
    "we do not consider the effect of metallicity on the rates .     on a logarithmic axis .",
    "data as labeled ( see text for details ) , agree to within @xmath30% for @xmath31 .",
    "the uncertainty increases with redshift , but the overall shape is well constrained .",
    "the fitted curve is shown by a solid line @xcite .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] ]    in the limit that @xmath26 is large only for small @xmath32 , we recover a prompt population of supernovae , i.e. , similar to core - collapse supernovae , for which the cosmic rate evolution is the same as for the star formation rate . for snia ,",
    "the observation that they occur in both young star - forming galaxies and old elliptical galaxies with little star formation demonstrates the need for a wide range of delay times .",
    "recently , two populations of snia , a `` prompt '' population with delay times @xmath33 gyr and a `` delayed '' population with delay times @xmath34 gyr , have been reported . whether this represents a truly bimodal distribution , or whether it is the result of two coarsely sampled bins of what is in reality a continuous dtd , remains uncertain .",
    "we adopt a power - law dtd , @xmath35 .",
    "power - laws have been reported from snia observations : for example , with @xmath36 from the snls data @xcite , with @xmath37 from observations of transients in passively evolving galaxies @xcite , with @xmath38 from local snia in the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) @xcite , and most recently @xmath39 from cluster snia @xcite .",
    "in fact , the number of wds following an instantaneous star formation burst is also a simple power - law in @xmath32 : for an initial mass function @xmath40 ( @xmath41 for salpeter ) and a power - law approximation to the evolutionary time - scale of 38 @xmath9 stars @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , the index is @xmath44 .",
    "however , this distribution extends only over the lifetimes of progenitors , 30400 myr , which is much smaller than the observed range of delay times . the extra time needed for mass transfer before triggering a snia would shift the delay time distribution towards longer delays , but the final dtd is largely dependent on the properties of the binary and its evolution .",
    "we apply our dtd over times 0.113 gyr and adopt @xmath45 as a parameter .",
    "the lower time limit could be as short as the lifetime of a 8 @xmath9 star , @xmath46 0.03  gyr , but recent studies of the spatial distribution of snia in their host galaxies indicate a lower limit of 0.2  gyr @xcite .",
    "we adopt 0.1 gyr ; at the precision of the current snia rate measurements , our results are not very sensitive to small delays .",
    "we fix our upper limit to the look - back time to @xmath47 , which is sufficiently long to accommodate snia observed in the oldest elliptical galaxies . allowing a larger value would not change the redshift evolution , and would simply scale the efficiency .",
    "the cosmic star formation rate density is shown in figure  [ fig : sfr ] .",
    "the compilation of @xcite , which includes data from multiple star formation indicators , is shown together with recent data from mid - infrared - emitting galaxies @xcite , lyman break galaxies ( lbg ) @xcite , and gamma - ray burst ( grb ) host galaxies @xcite .",
    "note that @xcite report results integrated down to a chosen luminosity limit ; we show instead complete integrations ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we also show hubble ultra deep field ( udf ) measurements from @xcite , similarly integrated to low galaxy luminosities .",
    "new udf results from @xcite have just appeared . as these indicate a steeper rise at low galaxy luminosities , the integration for the full star formation rate would need to be carefully regulated , and we do not perform this here .",
    "the star formation rate has been checked by independently measured quantities , such as the extragalactic background light @xcite , stellar mass density @xcite , and upper limits on the diffuse supernova neutrino background @xcite .    on the top axis",
    "we label cosmic time .",
    "it highlights that delay times of gyrs will result in noticeable differences in the slope between the star formation and snia rate rates .",
    "the star formation rate rapidly increases by one order of magnitude between redshift 0 and 1 , which has been very well measured by a variety of indicators .",
    "this serves as an important feature to be compared to the snia rate . at higher redshift ,",
    "the star formation rate eventually declines , at first slowly after @xmath48 , and then more rapidly after @xmath49 .",
    "the exact slope above @xmath49 remains uncertain , although this does not affect our conclusions , as we discuss in section [ sec : ratesynthesis ] .",
    "since the first measurement of snia at cosmological distances @xcite , many surveys have collected homogenous samples of ccd - discovered snia .",
    "these surveys periodically observe the same patch of sky , or the same sample of galaxies , to find transients .",
    "cuts are applied to select the most confidently - identified supernovae , and corrections for dust and incompleteness are applied .",
    "we summarize the present snia rate measurements in table  [ table : data ] .",
    "the high redshift ( @xmath50 ) rates are the hardest to measure .",
    "dust corrections are non - trivial and uncertain , e.g. , the dust corrected data of @xcite are a factor @xmath51 higher than their uncorrected data .",
    "even this has been argued to be insufficient and the rates could be treated as lower limits @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "snia surveys are likely contaminated by core - collapse supernovae , for which the rate increases from @xmath52 at @xmath53 to @xmath54 by @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath34 times the snia rate by @xmath48 .",
    "it is therefore important that only the most confidently - identified snia  those that are spectroscopically confirmed  are selected for rate measurements .",
    "indeed , rates derived using photometric classification @xcite are generally higher than those based on a higher fraction of spectroscopically confirmed snia @xcite .",
    "this is usually reflected in the large systematic errors .",
    "finally , the sample sizes rapidly become small at high redshift , where typically @xmath55 23 .",
    "these issues make it difficult to use the high redshift rate measurements @xcite , even though they would be very sensitive to delays due to the small cosmic time difference since the first stars were being formed .    at intermediate redshift ( @xmath56 ) , many of the measurements are based solely on spectroscopic confirmed snia .",
    "multi - band photometric identification is also now reliable : @xcite show that in the sdss - ii supernova survey only @xmath462% of the photometric snia in @xmath57 may be misidentified .",
    "furthermore , the effects of dust become less important than at high redshifts .",
    "however , many surveys target a pre - selected sample of galaxies and , while a large sample is adopted , there would be a bias towards bright galaxies , and supernovae that explode in faint galaxies would be missed .",
    "lastly , we note that sample sizes vary largely from survey to survey .    finally , in the local ( @xmath58 mpc ) volume , the rate has been calculated from compilations of carefully selected snia , as well as the local loss measurement @xcite .",
    "note that the rate calculated from @xcite probably reflects a local enhancement ( section [ sec : catalog ] ) .      ) .",
    "the best - fit @xmath59 power - law dtd ( solid ) is shown , with a shaded band reflecting the uncertainty .",
    "other dtd shown are as labeled in figure [ fig : cosmicrate ] ; they do not fit the data as well .",
    "[ fig : localrate ] ]    compared to the star formation rate , the snia rate is further away from a consensus .",
    "although the number of rate measurements has increased , the scatter is large , and at times , measurements in comparable redshifts are in direct disagreement .",
    "bearing in mind the strengths and weaknesses of the data , we group the rate measurements into two categories :    * _ filled points _ : those based on dedicated surveys using only spectroscopically identified snia .",
    "we also include select surveys with less than 100% spectroscopic identification , including the survey by sdss which includes an order of magnitude more snia than any other survey @xcite , and measurements by @xcite which are the most reliable measurements in the high redshift regime . * _ empty points _ : those based largely on photometrically identified snia .",
    "we caution that even within each category , the sample size , observation schedule , limiting magnitude , and other conditions vary , and our description is simply an attempt to appreciate some of the important differences between measurements @xcite .",
    "now , we can make better sense of the calculated and measured snia rates despite their uncertainties .",
    "when we restrict ourselves to the filled points , we find that the snia rate increases by only a factor @xmath513 from redshift 0 to 0.8 or so . on the other hand , the cosmic star formation rate increases by a factor 10 from redshift 0 to 1 .",
    "_ this implies that a large fraction of snia have cosmologically - large time delays_.    we show in figures [ fig : localrate ] and [ fig : cosmicrate ] the calculated and measured snia rates .",
    "we fit the calculated cosmic snia rate form to the selection of rate data consisting of filled points and local measurements ( excluding that by @xcite ) . for the power - law dtd",
    "we fit for the normalization at redshift zero , @xmath60 , and the dtd exponent , @xmath45 .",
    "we find best - fit values @xmath61 with @xmath62 for 17 degrees of freedom .",
    "the projections of the @xmath63 elliptical contour give @xmath64 and @xmath1 ; these parameters are strongly anti - correlated .",
    "the uncertainty is shown as grey shading in the figures . the best - fit efficiency and uncertainty of making snia",
    "is @xmath65 , or , assuming a snia progenitor mass range of 38 @xmath10 , a snia fraction ( which we define as the number of snia divided by the number of 38 @xmath9 stars formed ; the fraction of stars in snia - producing binaries is twice this ) of @xmath66% .    , but over the entire redshift range where data are available .",
    "in addition to the best - fit @xmath59 power - law dtd ( solid ) , we show the no delay ( dotted ) , the two - component dtd of @xcite ( dot - dashed ) , and the 3.4 gyr narrow dtd of @xcite ( dot - dot - dashed ) , as labeled . [",
    "fig : cosmicrate ] ]    in addition to the power - law dtd we show the bimodal dtd of @xcite ( dot - dashed ) , the 3.4 gyr narrow dtd of @xcite ( dot - dot - dashed ) , and the no - delay case ( dotted ) , for comparison .",
    "these dtds do not fit the data as well , with @xmath67 values of 10 , 17 , and 21 , respectively .",
    "all rise too fast compared to the reliable data ( filled points ) .",
    "this also means they underpredict the @xmath53 rate .",
    "the different results in @xcite are due to the choice of data .",
    "the narrow dtd is driven by a declining snia rate at @xmath68 ( see green left - pointing triangles in figure [ fig : cosmicrate ] ) , while our result is driven by the slow rise at low redshift .    at present",
    ", the dtd does not clearly identify the snia progenitor scenario , because both the sd and dd scenarios can lead to power - law dtds with @xmath69 . in the dd scenario ,",
    "the delay is approximately dictated by the time taken by a binary to merge by angular momentum loss , which from general relativity scales as the fourth power of the binary separation .",
    "for a logarithmically - flat distribution of binary separations , one obtains @xmath38 . although binary evolution synthesis studies of the sd scenario typically show that the dtd peaks at characteristic scales related to stable mass transfer ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , power - law dtds have also been predicted : for example , @xcite report power - law dtds with @xmath69 .",
    "both progenitor scenarios are acceptable fits , but as predictions of snia progenitor scenarios improve and snia rate data accumulates , better testing would become possible .",
    "we have assumed for simplicity a power - law dtd ; in order to generally test the progenitor scenario , a generic form for the dtd should be statistically tested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    the choice of the initial mass function does not affect the shape of the snia rate , but changes the number of snia progenitor stars .",
    "this introduces a small tens of percent difference in the efficiency . for a modern baldry - glazebrook initial mass function with a low - mass suppression @xcite ,",
    "the snia fraction required is @xmath70% .",
    "since the comparison of cosmic rates is not sensitive to small delays , there could be more short - lived progenitors than indicated by our simple dtd form .",
    "uncertainty in the cosmic star formation rate beyond @xmath49 affects the low redshift snia slope , albeit weakly , through the long tail of the dtd .",
    "there is a degeneracy in the high - redshift star formation slope and the value of @xmath45 , where a higher star formation rate can be compensated by a larger @xmath45 .",
    "however , at the precision of the current snia rate measurements , this uncertainty does not affect our conclusions .",
    "our snia efficiency is comparable to those from recent studies of volumetric snia rates @xcite , and somewhat lower than those derived by other methods @xcite .",
    "note that comparisons must be done with a common assumption for the initial mass function .",
    "as described above , a more modern initial mass function would increase our efficiency , although a difference remains .",
    "the true value of the efficiency remains to be determined ; see @xcite for a detailed discussion and implications of the snia efficiency . for example , our snia fraction contrasts with the @xmath71% advocated in some dd scenarios , where conservative conditions on the mass ratios are applied @xcite .",
    "the higher required efficiency that we found suggests the need to relax some assumptions , or to include contributions from snia of lower mass progenitors .",
    "we should note here that our definition for efficiency implicitly assumes binaries that would become a snia within @xmath72 gyr .",
    "it is revealing to discuss the snia rate jointly with the core - collapse supernova rate .",
    "the ratio of snia to core - collapse supernova ( ia / ii ) at @xmath53 is @xmath730.3 .",
    "here we use the @xmath53 cosmic snia rate instead of the local 10 mpc data , as the latter rate is @xmath33 per year ; the recent decade , for example , had no snia @xcite .",
    "since snia are delayed , the snia rate should increase less strongly than the star formation rate and the core - collapse rate from @xmath53 to @xmath48 .",
    "the ia / ii ratio should therefore decrease with redshift in this range .",
    "however , the data do not clearly show such a trend , being consistent with no evolution ( @xcite ; this is true even with updates on the core - collapse rate , e.g. , ) .",
    "a likely possibility is that fainter core - collapse supernovae are being missed compared to the brighter snia ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the importance of the missing core - collapse supernovae spans topics such as the formation of black holes in massive stellar collapse , supernova neutrinos , and metal enrichment .",
    "gamma rays reveal information of the snia interior that can be effectively used to study snia physics .",
    "we first review the gamma - ray emission per snia , focusing on a range of snia models that accommodate normal , superluminous , and subluminous snia ( section [ sec : gammaemission ] ) . using the cosmic snia rate analyzed in section [ sec : progenitor ] ,",
    "we discuss prospects for using the cgb to detect snia gamma rays ( section [ sec : cgb ] ) .",
    "we then discuss the local snia rate with higher precision than previously possible , by combining our cosmic snia rate analysis with snia rates from supernova catalogs of nearby supernovae ( section [ sec : catalog ] ) .",

    "[ fig : lightcurve ] ]    however , more important in the future is improving beyond a single 847 kev detection and measuring the gamma - ray light curve , as this ultimately holds the power to distinguish between snia models .",
    "in particular , the period during which the system transitions from an optically thick to a thin one gives the @xmath119 in eq .  [ eq : emission ] and provides the best opportunity for model discrimination .",
    "for example , he - detonation produces @xmath11ni nearer to the wd surface compared to other models , resulting in an earlier transition and hence an earlier rise of gamma - ray lines .",
    "deflagration is the other extreme , with ignition occurring in the central regions of the wd , resulting in slower rise of the gamma - ray emission .",

    "in addition , detection of the 812 kev line from @xmath11ni is important , given its strong emission during the transition period .",
    "in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] , both super - luminous snia ( solid ) and normal snia ( dashed ) are shown together , but optical observations would distinguish between these two classes so we focus on model testing within each class .",
    "first , we show on the right y - axis of figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] the significance that can be achieved by _ act _ observing a snia at 20 mpc in 1-day ( @xmath120 s ) viewing periods . since mev gamma - ray satellites are dominated by detector backgrounds , the significance of the snia signal scales as @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the signal counts , @xmath123 is the background counts , and @xmath124 is the viewing period .",
    "the targeted @xmath102 sensitivity of _ act _ is @xmath125 ( for @xmath92 s ) , and we scale it to a viewing period of 1 day .",
    "we see that _ act _ will allow detailed reconstruction of the 812 kev and 847 kev light curves with very large significance at this distance .",
    "second , provided that the snia is close enough for sufficient photon statistics , studying the shape of the light curve does not depend on knowing the exact distance to the snia .",
    "the shape is distinctly different between models , as we illustrate more clearly in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] , where we show the difference counts at _ act _ , for a viewing period of 1 day , all relative to the @xmath126 model .",
    "an uncertain distance would scale the fluxes accordingly , but retain the shape differences between models . for illustration ,",
    "the square root of the background counts is shown as the horizontal shading .",
    "_ act _ would easily distinguish between normal snia models with high significance at this distance .",
    "the difference between superluminous snia is smaller than the square root of the background counts ; better testing would be possible with a coarser time binning .",

    "the rate of snia within 20  mpc is @xmath3 per year , and therefore , _ act _",
    "will strongly constrain snia models at a rate of at least 1 per year .",
    "snia further away also yield information , with statistical significance gained by coarser time binning . at 220 times per year , _ act _ would detect the 812 kev emission and build a detailed 847 kev light curve . at 60 - 80 times per year ,",
    "_ act _ would detect the 847 kev light curve near peak , and at almost 100 times per year , it would detect the 847 kev emission and measure the variation in the @xmath11ni yield of snia .",
    "we summarize these gamma - ray detection prospects in table  [ table : number ] .",
    "the wide - field all - sky nature of _ act _ could in principle detect snia independently of optical discoveries , although in practice next - generation optical surveys would bring out the full potential of _ act _ by providing more targets for joint analysis .",
    "_ dual _ s focusing capabilities would rely on knowledge of the snia location from an optical trigger .",
    "for all the above estimates we have assumed the narrow - line sensitivities of detectors as documented .",
    "since snia gamma - ray lines are expected to be doppler - broadened by up to 3% , this treatment is optimistic , although it does allow us to compare the maximum performance of detectors . in practice , the broad - line sensitivities are only marginally worse than the narrow - line sensitivities .",
    "for example , the @xmath135% broadened line sensitivity of _ act _ is @xmath136 ( @xmath7 in @xmath92 s ; @xcite ) , a factor 2 different from the narrow - line sensitivity .",
    "the gamma - ray horizon therefore decrease by @xmath137 , and the numbers in the final column of table [ table : number ] decrease to 2030 , 16 - 21 , 15 , and 0.11 , respectively .",
    "although smaller , these rates would still allow rapid progress in the understanding of snia .",
    "similarly , the significance and @xmath138 for the broad - line case can be calculated to be @xmath139 and @xmath140 in a 1-day bin , respectively .",
    "the significance remains high , and @xmath138 remains smaller than the model differences , demonstrating the physics potential .",
    "we focused on the 812 kev and 847 kev lines because they are expected to have the highest fluxes .",
    "there are other lines for which there are interesting prospects , for example the 158 kev line from @xmath11ni and the 1238 kev line from @xmath11co .",
    "the detectability of these lines is only marginally less than that of the 812 kev and 847 kev lines ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : ni][eq : co ] ) .",
    "additionally , the 511 kev line from annihilation of positrons produced in @xmath11co decay ( eq .  [ eq : co ] ) is particularly important for understanding the positron escape fraction , thought to be @xmath3% , but quite uncertain @xcite .",
    "it has important implications for the origin of the galactic 511 kev emission ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it should also be mentioned that other radioactive nuclei such as @xmath141ti and @xmath142ni are expected in snia .",
    "the half life of @xmath143 is 68 years , implying historical snia as prime targets rather than the snia discussed in this paper .",
    "the @xmath144 decay chain , with half lives of 52 hours and 391 days , would be a more suitable target .",
    "however , as the production of @xmath142ni is not as abundant as @xmath11ni in most cases , it would be a useful line only for exceptionally close snia .",
    "other model - distinguishing features that we have not mentioned include line shift and line width evolutions . during the first few weeks",
    ", the high optical depth means that much of the gamma - ray emission originates from the approaching ejecta , with photons escaping essentially radially , so that the lines are blue - shifted .",
    "together with the line width , these are measures of the expansion velocity , and their time evolution tests snia models .",
    "the caveat with the former is that shifts occur mostly during the optically thick regime , so model testing is difficult except for exceptional cases ( e.g. , the dd scenario we mention next ) .",
    "the line width offers a more promising test , in particular with detectors with spectral resolution of order @xmath145300 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for detailed predictions ) .    the gamma - ray emission for the dd scenario experiences significant suppression due to the envelope resulting from the merging wds . in the",
    "det2env4 _ model of @xcite , the enveloping matter means that the line shifts remain high for a long period of time , up to @xmath6 days , whereas sd scenario models all fall in a few weeks @xcite .",
    "in addition , the envelope strongly suppresses the 812 kev from @xmath11ni decay , so that the flux is weaker than even the deflagration model _ w7_. the 847",
    "kev emission also peaks at a later stage . recently ,",
    "several authors have explored the collision of two wds in dense stellar systems as an alternate pathway to snia within the family of dd scenarios @xcite .",
    "shock - triggered thermonuclear explosions in such events are predicted to yield @xmath11ni masses that are sufficient to power subluminous snia .",
    "although detailed gamma - ray light curves have not yet been published , they could be targets for next - generation gamma - ray detectors if their gamma - ray emissions are comparable to those of subluminous snia .",
    "growth of the snia sample has led to variants of snia being discovered .",
    "deep searches have revealed peculiar faint explosions : sn  2002bj , observed by the loss survey , was a faint snia showing unusually rapid evolution on time scales of days @xcite .",
    "the low luminosity and short rise time ( @xmath146 7 days ) translate to 0.150.25@xmath10 of @xmath11ni .",
    "another supernova , sn  2005e , has an estimated rise time of 79 days , very small estimated @xmath11ni yield , and spectra showing abundance of helium burning products @xcite .",
    "its location in an isolated galaxy with little star formation activity suggests an old progenitor , e.g. , wd binaries , instead of the core collapse of a massive star .",
    "these resemble so - called `` .ia '' explosions , which has been proposed to occur in binary wds undergoing helium mass transfer @xcite .",
    "as the binary evolves , the mass required for unstable helium burning increases , until a final flash that leads to a faint thermonuclear explosion that is one - tenth as bright for one - tenth the time of a normal snia @xcite .",
    "the predicted rates match those observed , both being in the range of a few percent of snia .",
    "although the @xmath11ni yield is lower than in a normal snia , this is compensated by a larger escape probability for gamma rays .",
    "indeed , the rapidly falling light curves of snia variants suggest that of order unity of the @xmath11co decay gamma rays are escaping already by @xmath147 days .",
    "this contrasts with normal snia , where up to 90% of the gamma rays at 20 days are down - scattered in the ejecta .",
    "it turns out the low @xmath11ni yield and high escape fraction almost compensate each other .",
    "the time - integrated escape fraction of gamma - ray photons in normal snia is about 50% , so that snia variants , with half as much @xmath11ni and up to twice the total escape fraction , provide a comparable gamma - ray output to normal snia .",
    "the low rate of snia variants therefore make them subdominant contributors to gamma - ray observations .",
    "the situation is potentially more interesting for positrons . adopting the canonical escape fraction 1% for normal snia @xcite",
    ", snia variants could contribute up to @xmath51 times more than normal snia towards the positron budget , depending on their rate .",
    "this would help narrow the gap between the supernovae positron yield and that required from observations of the galactic 511 kev line .",
    "again , line detection will prove important : late - time detection of the 511 kev line would provide a direct constraint of the fraction of positrons escaping through the ejecta .",
    "another snia variant is the extremely luminous super - chandrasekhar mass snia .",
    "they exhibit higher magnitudes and slower ejecta velocities compared to normal snia , with predicted progenitor masses that exceed the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "for example , sn  2003fg was a @xmath148 snia with a predicted ni yield of @xmath149 and progenitor mass of @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "the recent super - chandrasekhar mass sn  2009dc has a ni yield of @xmath151 @xcite , and spectropolarimetry observations suggest the explosion was near spherical , supporting a truly super - chandrasekhar progenitor @xcite . rapid rotation may support such a massive wd .",
    "binary wds could also produce super - chandrasekhar mass snia .",
    "if the light curves of candidate super - chandrasekhar mass supernovae are indeed powered by a larger - than - normal amount of produced nickel , this will give a large gamma - ray signal ; if they are instead powered by circumstellar interactions , this will not give such a large gamma - ray signal .",
    "gamma rays provide unique clues to the currently debated progenitor properties and explosion mechanisms of type ia supernovae ( snia ) .",
    "they directly probe the power source of snia and provide tomography of the snia ejecta . as the importance of snia in astrophysics and cosmology continues to grow ,",
    "the detection of gamma rays become increasingly essential .",

    "below we summarize our results .",
    "we first investigate the snia rate , which is a prerequisite for snia gamma ray detection prospects .",
    "it is also interesting since the snia rate with respect to its progenitor formation rate depends on what the snia progenitors are .",
    "we jointly analyze the cosmic star formation rate , cosmic snia rate , and the snia rate derived from snia catalogs .",
    "we deduce a delay time distribution ( dtd ) and snia fraction that fit the data , and discuss the local ( @xmath152 mpc volume ) snia rate .    * _ delay - times _ : when snia rate measurements are categorized according to sample size and fraction of spectroscopically - identified snia , we find that the more reliable measurements collectively show significantly slower evolution with redshift than the star formation rate .",
    "the difference is due to the delay between progenitor formation and snia : we find that a dtd of the form @xmath153 with @xmath154 provides a good fit .",
    "the substantially - prompt bimodal dtd of @xcite and the narrow gaussian dtd around 3.4 gyr of @xcite do not fit the global data as well . *",

    "* _ implication for local snia rate _ : the local snia rate is much higher than previously thought .",

    "<S> we investigate prospects for gamma - ray telescopes to exploit the facts that escaping gamma rays directly reveal the power source of snia and uniquely provide tomography of the expanding ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> we find large improvements relative to earlier studies by gehrels et al .  in 1987 and timmes & woosley in 1997 due to larger and more certain snia rates and advances in gamma - ray detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed advanced compton telescope , with a narrow - line sensitivity @xmath5 times better than that of current satellites , would , on an annual basis , detect up to @xmath6 snia ( @xmath7 ) and provide revolutionary model discrimination for snia within 20 mpc , with gamma - ray light curves measured with @xmath8 significance daily for @xmath6 days . </S>",
    "<S> even more modest improvements in detector sensitivity would open a new and invaluable astronomy with frequent snia gamma - ray detections . </S>"
