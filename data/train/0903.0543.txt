    "@xcite .    storing - retrieving of transformations",
    "can also be seen as an instance of _ quantum learning _ , a topic which received increasing attention in the past few years ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for different approaches ) : suppose that a user can dispose of @xmath0 uses of a black box implementing an unknown unitary transformation @xmath1 .",
    "today the user is allowed to exploit the black box at his convenience , running an arbitrary quantum circuit that makes @xmath0 calls to it .",
    "tomorrow , however , the black box will no longer be available , and the user will be asked to reproduce @xmath1 on a new input state @xmath2 unknown to him of her .",
    "we refer to this scenario as to quantum learning of the unitary @xmath1 from a finite set of @xmath0 examples .",
    "generally , the user may be required to reproduce @xmath1 more than once , i.e. to produce @xmath3 copies of @xmath1 . in this case",
    "it is important to assess how the performance of learning decays with the number of copies required , as it was done in the case of quantum cloning @xcite .",
    "let us consider first the @xmath4 case . clearly , the only thing we can do today is to apply the black box to a known ( generally entangled ) state @xmath5 .",
    "after that , what remains is the state @xmath6 , that can be stored in a quantum memory .",
    "then , when the new input state @xmath2 becomes available , we send @xmath2 and @xmath7 to an optimal _ retrieving channel _ , which emulates @xmath1 applied to @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath8 input copies are available , we must also find the best storing strategy : we can , e.  g. , opt for a _ parallel strategy _ where @xmath1 is applied on @xmath0 different systems , yielding @xmath9 , or for a _ sequential strategy _ where @xmath1 is applied @xmath0 times on the same system , alternated with other known unitaries , yielding @xmath10 .",
    "the most general storing strategy is described by a _ quantum circuit board _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , a quantum network with open slots where the input copies can be inserted @xcite . in summary , solving the problem of the optimal quantum learning means finding the optimal storing board and the optimal retrieving channel .",
    "an alternative to coherent retrieval is to estimate @xmath1 , to store the outcome in a classical memory , and to perform the estimated unitary on the new input state .",
    "this incoherent estimation - based strategy has the double advantage of avoiding the expensive use of a quantum memory ( which nowadays can not store information for more than few milliseconds),and of allowing one to reproduce @xmath1 an unlimited number of times with constant quality .",
    "however , estimation - based strategies are typically suboptimal for the similar task of quantum cloning @xcite , and , by analogy , one would expect a coherent retrieval to achieve better performances .",
    "surprisingly , we find that whenever the unknown unitary is randomly drawn from a group the incoherent strategies already achieve the ultimate performances for quantum learning .",
    "in particular , we show that the performance of the optimal retrieving channel is equal to that of optimal estimation .",
    "for example , for a completely unknown qubit unitary the optimal fidelity behaves as @xmath11 asymptotically for large @xmath0 .",
    "our result can be also extended to solve the problem of _ optimal inversion _ of the unknown @xmath1 , in which the user is asked to perform @xmath12 . in this case",

    "of course , the same remark also holds when the @xmath64 output copies .",

    "<S> we address the problem of learning an unknown unitary transformation from a finite number of examples . </S>",
    "<S> the problem consists in finding the learning machine that optimally emulates the examples , thus reproducing the unknown unitary maximum fidelity . learning a unitary is equivalent to storing it in the state of a quantum memory ( the memory of the learning machine ) , and subsequently retrieving it . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that , whenever the unknown unitary is drawn from a group , the optimal strategy consists in a parallel call of the available uses followed by a `` measure - and - rotate '' retrieving . </S>",
    "<S> differing from the case of quantum cloning , where the incoherent `` measure - and - prepare '' strategies are typically suboptimal , in the case of learning the  measure - and - rotate \" strategy is optimal even when the learning machine is asked to reproduce a single copy of the unknown unitary . </S>",
    "<S> we finally address the problem of the optimal inversion of an unknown unitary evolution , showing also in this case the optimality of the `` measure - and - rotate '' strategies and applying our result to the optimal approximate realignment of reference frames for quantum communication . </S>"
