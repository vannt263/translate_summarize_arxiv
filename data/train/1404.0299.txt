    "the concept of dark matter is introduced first by zwicky in 1933 @xcite as the missing mass problem .",
    "he observed that the moving galaxies in coma cluster move faster than what is predicted by considering the visible mass of the cluster . using virial theorem to estimate the dynamical mass of coma cluster",
    ", he determined that there is some discrepancy in the observed and computed masses .",
    "the next related observation is the rotation curves of spiral galaxies@xcite .",
    "the rotation curves can be determined by measuring the rotational velocities of stars in the optical region of galaxies .",
    "the same holds for clusters of galaxies . for non",
    " visible parts of galaxies the frequency shift of @xmath1 line of neutral hydrogen clouds is used to determine the velocity .",
    "these observations show that the rotation curve remains nearly flat at enough large distance from the center .",
    "both of these observations usually are explained by assuming a spherical halo of _ dark matter _ around the astronomical objects .",
    "moreover in describing the stability of disk galaxies@xcite and also in the structure formation at the cosmological scales@xcite , dark matter component plays an essential role .",
    "the concept of dark matter component is basically a prediction of general theory of relativity applied to the astronomical systems .",
    "in fact there are two roads for cosmologists and astronomers for describing the observed facts , first , adding an exotic component to the matter content of the universe@xcite , and second , modifying einstein s theory of gravity in such a way that the correct results can be obtained using the observed ordinary matter@xcite .    in the first viewpoint , the cold dark matter ( cdm ) is successful to describe cmb anisotropies and the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "but it suffers from some problems such as cusp ",
    "core problem@xcite . by considering the dark matter component as a perfect fluid , it is straightforward to show that applying the weak energy condition ( wec ) and matching with the schwarzschild metric at the halo surface , make the dark matter pressure - less@xcite .",
    "therefore the authors in @xcite assumed that the dark matter fluid is not ideal and that it s pressure has different radial and tangential components . by suggesting a variety of equations of state for dark matter and using the linear field approximation of general relativity",
    ", they produce the flat part of the rotation curve .",
    "this can also be achieved using a scalar field@xcite as dark matter .",
    "an exponential potential for the scalar field is not only able to produce a constant orbital velocity but also can make the energy conditions to be satisfied@xcite . furthermore by introducing a novel scalar field the authors of @xcite show that a numerical analysis of einstein s equations gives the correct rotation curve at arbitrary radius .",
    "this also solves the cusp - core problem .",
    "it has to be noted that taking the flat rotation curve as input , the authors of @xcite find the space - time metric and the equation of state of dark matter as a prefect fluid .",
    "but the solution is not matched to the exterior schwarzschild metric .    in the latter viewpoint ,",
    "there is nt any dark matter component and the observations are explained by geometrical effects .",
    "this means that to describe flat rotation curves , one uses an extended theory of gravity without introducing dark matter .",
    "for example , @xmath0 theories@xcite which are the simplest modifications of general relativity can predict correct rotation curves . choosing different forms for @xmath0",
    ", one can investigate the dark matter problem @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite have found the appropriate form of @xmath0 admitting a solution in the form of a perturbed schwarzschild metric for the dark matter halo .",
    "this leads to a rotation curve which approaches to a constant at large enough radii from the center of galaxy .",
    "also in @xcite , it is shown that a constant orbital velocity leads to @xmath2 in which @xmath3 depends to the velocity .    in the above mentioned references @xcite additional assumptions are made to obtain the form of @xmath0 , but here we propose an @xmath0 modification of einstein s gravity suitable for the flat region of rotation curves of galaxies without any additional assumptions . to do this , in section 2 we first briefly review the field equations of @xmath0 theory in the form of einstein s equations with an effective energy  momentum tensor",
    ". then we shall use an exact static spherically symmetric solution of @xmath0 theory obtained in @xcite , and see that it is not possible to match it to the exterior schwarzschild metric at the surface of the halo .",
    "due to small circular velocities of objects in the halo , we follow an approximate method to find another solution of @xmath0 theory suitable for describing rotation curves .",
    "the boundary conditions at the surface of halo are used to fix the arbitrary constants of the solution . in this way the effective density and pressure of dark matter are obtained .    finally in section 3",
    "we discuss the gravitational lensing properties of this solution .",
    "to describe the motion of a test particle in the halo of a spiral galaxy , it is usually assumed that the space ",
    "time metric is spherically symmetric and static , i.e. : @xmath4 the geodesic equation for such a particle rotating around the center of the galaxy in a circular orbit leads to : @xmath5 in which @xmath6 is the tangential velocity of the test particle and we are using the units in which @xmath7 .",
    "it is a well known fact that the rotation curves of the spiral galaxies tends to a constant tangential velocity in the interval @xmath8 using relation ( [ v ] ) , one could get : @xmath9 in the flat region of the rotation curve , where @xmath10 is an arbitrary constant , @xmath11 is a small dimensionless parameter and @xmath12 @xmath13 represents the optical or luminous radius of the galaxy .",
    "this form of the time  time component of",
    "the metric is different from the schwarzschild one and thus it is not correct to assume that all the matter in the galaxy is the luminous one at its center .",
    "this is usually supposed to be an argument for believing in dark matter filling the halo of spiral galaxies .",
    "an alternative way is to describe the rotation curves as a geometrical effect , using extended gravity models such as @xmath0 theories .",
    "the action functional of @xmath0 theories is usually written as : @xmath14 leading to the following field equations : @xmath15 in which @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the energy ",
    "momentum tensor of matter .    using the line element ( [ met ] )",
    ", the vacuum field equations would result in @xcite : @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the ricci scalar is also given by : @xmath21 \\label{e3}\\ ] ] it is interesting to see which kind of effective energy ",
    "momentum tensor is given by this model .",
    "to do so , we rewrite equation ( [ freq ] ) in the form of einstein s equations @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the effective gravitational coupling constant and @xmath24 putting this in the form of a perfect fluid energy  momentum tensor and inserting the metric ( [ met ] ) , one can show that : @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the effective density , radial and tangential pressures respectively .",
    "also a prime over any quantity represents differentiation with respect to the normalized radial coordinate @xmath31      using the exact solutions of @xcite ( see the solution i of table 2 ) , a simple solution of vacuum spherically symmetric static character suitable for flat rotation curves can be found .",
    "it is : @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36\\ ] ] this leads to the following form of @xmath0 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are arbitrary constants .",
    "with @xmath42 one gets @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "the first choice for @xmath45 essentially leads to the solution given in @xcite , while the second is @xmath46 .    in order to have a meaningful solution",
    ", we have to match the solution to the schwarzschild solution outside the halo , defined as : @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a constant , @xmath50 and in terms of the tangential velocity or @xmath51 can be written as @xmath52 .",
    "the surface of the halo can be defined as : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the normalized radius of the halo .",
    "it can be simply shown that it is impossible to do match the above exact internal solution to the exterior schwarzschild one .",
    "since the parameter @xmath51 is small , one can adopt a perturbative solution .",
    "lets write : @xmath55 for not so large values of @xmath56 this is essentially @xmath57 .    introducing @xmath58 and @xmath59 the equations ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] )",
    "are then : @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 expanding @xmath64 and @xmath65 in terms of powers of @xmath51 : @xmath66 the above equations can be solved order by order .    in zeroth order",
    "the equations are : @xmath67 @xmath68 there are two solutions , first @xmath69 and second @xmath70 the first solution has the property of leading to @xmath71 and thus to @xmath72 .",
    "since this latter solution is einsteins gravity corrected by small terms , we use this solution in the rest of this paper .    in the first order",
    "we have : @xmath73 @xmath74 with the solution @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are integration constants .    as a result",
    "up to first order , one gets : @xmath80 and @xmath81 where @xmath82 .    in order to find the form of @xmath0 one can use equation ( [ e3 ] ) to obtain @xmath83 as a function of @xmath56 and",
    "then obtain @xmath0 via integration of @xmath84 .",
    "we have : @xmath85 integrating @xmath84 we get : @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89    the above @xmath0 theory can describe the rotation curves without any dark matter . in terms of the radial distance , from equations ( [ x])([f ] )",
    "we get : @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92",
    "we can get some relations between the constants by matching the solution to the exterior schwarzschild metric at @xmath54 . using ( [ aout ] ) , ( [ xout ] ) , ( [ ain ] ) , ( [ x ] ) and satisfying condition ( [ sur ] ) , we get : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is some constant which can be obtained using the newtonian limit relation @xmath52 .",
    "this leads to @xmath95 .    using the above relations for the constants , the components of energy ",
    "momentum tensor have the following form : @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98    the effective density and pressure profiles are plotted in figure ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "as it can be seen in the plot , the effective density and tangential pressure are positive and decreasing , while the radial pressure is negative and increasing in the halo .",
    "an interesting property of these profiles is that in terms of scaled distance @xmath99 , the scaled density and pressure ( scaled with @xmath100 ) are independent of any parameter and thus they are universal .    .",
    "]    lets now apply the energy conditions to this fluid .",

    "the weak , null and strong energy conditions are satisfied but dominant energy condition is not satisfied anywhere .",
    "thus the effective matter representing the halo is not a normal kind of matter ( named by m. visser in @xcite , because of the breakdown of dec ) and gravitation is attractive in region @xmath102 ( because of the validity of sec ) . again , as for figure ( [ f1 ] ) , the domain of validity of energy conditions is also independent of the parameters of the model .",

    "this is an important difference between the model of @xcite ( and also @xcite ) and ours . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that this arbitrary constant should be smaller than @xmath122 in order to have attractive gravity as well as being in the newtonian regime .",
    "although the presented model can describe the flat rotation curves , the form of @xmath0 should be written in a universal form , i.e. independent of the galaxies parameters , to have a geometrical description of dark matter ( this fact is adopted in a variety of similar works in the literature , e.g. @xcite , while it is forgotten in some works @xcite ) .",
    "the relation ( [ f ] ) can be written in a universal form in the domain of validity of our approximation . to see this lets write the equations ( [ 44 ] ) and ( [ f ] ) using equations ( [ const ] ) in the form : @xmath123 @xmath124 where we have set @xmath125 and @xmath126 for simplifying the relations , and @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "it should be noted that the radius of the halo , @xmath129 , is very larger than the characteristic scale of the galaxy @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath130 . using the relation ( [ z1 ] ) one gets : @xmath131 this leads to @xmath132 where @xmath133 choosing @xmath134 as a universal constant , we get a geometric description of flat rotation curves .",
    "the radius of halo is inversely proportional to square root of @xmath51 or inversely proportional to @xmath135 .    according to ( [ v ] ) ,",
    "the tangential velocity is given by : @xmath136 therefore the tangential velocity depends on the universal constant @xmath134 as well as on the parameters @xmath129 and @xmath13 which are specific to each galaxy .",
    "in order to see how the halo affects the gravitational lensing , here we investigate the bending of a light ray passing through the space  time with the metric ( [ met ] ) , in which we are using the relations ( [ ain ] ) and ( [ x ] ) . the geodesic equations for a light ray moving in the equatorial plane , @xmath137 , can be written as : @xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath140 where @xmath141 is an arbitrary affine parameter and @xmath142 , @xmath143 are constants related to the energy and angular momentum of the photon . at the closest approach to origin , @xmath144",
    ", one has : @xmath145 introducing the new variable @xmath146 , the orbit equation is then : @xmath147 using the above equation we can evaluate the final angle at which the light ray propagates as : @xmath148 the deflection angle can be obtained by subtracting the no  gravity part from the above relation . for our case , no  gravity is given by @xmath149 .",
    "therefore the deflection angle is given by : @xmath150 lets first assume that the closest point is inside the halo , then the deflection angle is given by @xmath151 @xmath152 in which @xmath129 is the radius of the surface of the halo . using ( [ aout ] ) and ( [ xout ] ) a straightforward calculation yields : @xmath153 in which @xmath154 .    on the other hand for the case where the closest approach is outside the halo ,",
    "the propagation angle is given by : @xmath155 after doing a similar calculation , the result is just the familiar result of the schwarzschield metric : @xmath156    the deflection angle is plotted in figure ( [ f4 ] ) .",
    "an interesting feature is that for some values of @xmath144 , the deflection angle can be negative , that is we have reflection instead of refraction . for @xmath157",
    "the deflection angle is negative , where @xmath158 is the only real root of equation ( [ last ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the value of @xmath159 for which below it the deflection angle becomes negative is independent of the parameters of the model .",
    "the appearance of negative deflection angle is not surprising .",
    "this is because of the fact that for @xmath0 models , the energy conditions ( on the effective density and pressure ) can break .",
    "if one considers a congruence of geodesics in such models , there are cases in which this congruence is diverging instead of converging , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in fact for our model , when one considers a sufficiently small @xmath144 , @xmath0 ( given by equation ( [ z2 ] ) ) differs dramatically from @xmath83 and thus the strong energy condition breaks sufficiently and leads to a diverging congruence .",
    "the negative deflection angle can also be seen in some scalar ",
    "tensor models@xcite and in higher dimensional theories@xcite , in which again negative deflection angles are resulted from breakdown of effective strong energy condition leading to a negative tidal force .    .",
    "]    here this effect is resulted from the negativity of the radial pressure .",
    "this does not mean that we have anti  gravity . in the region that the strong energy condition is satisfied",
    "the gravity is attractive . for the region of validity of strong energy condition",
    "the deflection angle has a peak and this means that a wide congruence of light rays are deflected to a narrow angle and hence the gravity is attractive .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the question of whether dark matter can have a geometrical nature . in the context of @xmath0 theory of gravity",
    ", we found two solutions describing the dark halo of spiral galaxies .",
    "the first solution is exact but can not be matched to the exterior schwarzschild metric , while the second one is an approximate solution and can be matched to the exterior solution .",
    "the solution is completely determined using the asymptotic velocity of rotation curve , and the definition of halo surface as the surface of zero effective density and radial pressure .",
    "these are enough to fix the form of @xmath0 and the effective equation of state in the galaxy halo .    studying the energy conditions in the halo , shows that all the energy conditions are satisfied for radial coordinate larger than a critical value except the dominant energy condition which is never satisfied .",
    "this critical value is @xmath160 .    generally whether the dark matter pressure is smaller than ( or of the same order of )",
    "its density or not , is an open question and it depends on the nature of dark matter component@xcite . since the total equation of state parameter in the presented model is larger than one throughout the halo , the effective dark matter obeys a non  newtonian dynamics .",
    "we also investigated the lensing effect of the halo in this model and saw that for some values of impact parameters the lensing effect can result in negative deflection angle , which means that we have reflection instead of refraction .",
    "this is because of the fact that the radial pressure is negative and in the inner regions it is so negative that it can exert such a force that leads to reflection .",
    "there are some directions that one can generalize the results .",
    "first , although we did all the calculations up to first order in @xmath51 , it is not very difficult to go to any order of perturbation .",
    "second , we have used the asymptotic form of rotation curves , i.e. the flat portion , but in principle the whole rotation curve can be adopted for the purpose of obtaining an @xmath0 model .",
    "the calculations would be very cumbersome and thus using the weak field approximation helps .",
    "finally , it should be noted that although we used the schwarzschild solution for the exterior region , another choice may be some appropriate solution of @xmath0 models used in describing dark energy for the outer space  time . in this way",
    ", it might be possible to find an @xmath0 model appropriate both for galactic and cosmic scales .",
    "the question of possibility of finding such a model needs detailed calculations .",
    "therefore , the presented model should not be viewed as a universal model .",
    "it is only valid for describing the galactic halos .",
    "in fact using the obtained form of @xmath0 in equation ( [ last1 ] ) one can see that @xmath161 would be negative below @xmath162 . setting @xmath163 e.g. , below @xmath164 @xmath161 is negative .",
    "also the second derivative @xmath165 is always negative .",
    "therefore we have problems with stability and thus the model should not be extrapolated to other scales .",
