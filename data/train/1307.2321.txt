    "despite the central role of massive stars in almost all areas of astronomy , the physical processes involved in the formation of stars with masses @xmath8m@xmath9 are at present poorly understood ( e.g. , ) .",
    "theoretical and observational studies favor the idea that massive stars , similar to their lower mass counterparts , form from a collapsing cloud core .",
    "however , whether the subsequent formation of a protostar and further mass accretion occurs from an isolated massive molecular core ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , or under the influence of a cluster environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) remains a persistent question .",

    "named after the prototype object in the orion kl region , they have been surveyed throughout the galaxy in an effort to identify candidates for massive proto - stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "common search criteria were high fir luminosity , high molecular column densities and temperature , and the absence of strong radio continuum emission  the latter to ensure an earlier evolutionary phase than ultra - compact ( uc ) or hyper - compact ( hc ) hii regions .",
    "a particularly useful tracer of hmcs is the methyl cyanide ( ch@xmath0cn ) molecule . due to the centrifugal deformation of this symmetric top molecule ,",
    "its rotational spectrum consists of a series of closely spaced @xmath3components tracing rapidly increasing excitation energies .",
    "the @xmath3ladders are connected only through collisions so that excitation temperatures can in principle be measured from the ratios of @xmath3components , thus avoiding the usual calibration uncertainties that occur when comparing rotational transitions observed in different frequency bands .",
    "an extensive discussion of the microwave spectroscopy of methyl cyanide is given in @xcite .",
    "because of these spectroscopic properties , the ch@xmath0cn molecule is frequently used to determine temperatures in the dense molecular cores where massive stars form , using both statistical equilibrium calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or the simpler rotation diagram technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    another factor that favors the use of ch@xmath0cn as a tracer of hmcs",
    "is its enhanced abundance in warm ( t@xmath36k ) , dense ( @xmath37@xmath38 ) environments ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is generally thought to be caused by grain surface chemistry , either by primary reactions on the grain surface with subsequent release into the gas phase when the grain mantle evaporates , or , alternatively , by secondary reactions in the gas phase ( e.g. , @xcite , ) .",
    "recently , reported detection of ch@xmath0cn in the outflow lobes of the low - mass protostar l1157-b1 , and attributed the enhanced ch@xmath0cn abundance to shock chemistry . from these studies",
    "it is well - established that ch@xmath0cn traces an energetic environment similar to that expected in the immediate vicinity of massive proto - stars .    to investigate the hmc phase of massive star formation , several single dish ch@xmath0cn surveys have been made ( e.g. , ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , and a small number of sources have also been studied with mm - interferometers ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "several of the interferometric studies resulted in images of ch@xmath0cn structures that are elongated perpendicular to the direction of molecular outflows , with velocity gradients along the elongated structures ; this is usually explained as rotational motion of a circumstellar disk or torus ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the ch@xmath0cn molecule is thus a good choice to trace accretion disks around massive proto - stars , whose existence ( if confirmed ) , and properties will be important input for current models of massive star formation .    from the above discussion it is clear that observations of ch@xmath0cn with high sensitivity and angular resolution are well - suited to study accretion disks around massive stars .",
    "such observations have recently become more accessible using instruments such as the submillimeter array ( sma ) and alma .",
    "to facilitate such observations in the ch@xmath0cn j=12 @xmath1 11 line , the present study adds to the existing database of single dish studies of methyl cyanide .    in section [ observations_sec ]",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction , and we present the observational results in section [ results_sec ] . we conclude in section [ disc_sec ] with a discussion of these observational results .",
    "we observed 21 sources in 2008 from may 26 to 31 in the 1.3 mm ch@xmath0cn j=12 @xmath1 11 transition with the 10 m heinrich hertz submillimeter telescope ( smt ) on mt .",

    "most of our target sources are prominent hmc candidates with large iras luminosities .",
    "they all show the typical observational indicators of massive star formation in the hmc stage , namely massive molecular cores , h@xmath41o and ch@xmath0oh maser emission , warm molecular gas , weak ( or absent ) radio continuum emission , and the presence of jets and molecular flows .",
    "an exception is irdc 18223 - 3 , which is a massive infrared dark cloud with an embedded protostar , which may be in an earlier evolutionary state @xcite .",

    "we used all six available backends ; four low spectral resolution and two high spectral resolution .",
    "the low spectral resolution backends were the acoustic - optic spectrometers ( aoss ) aos - a and aos - b with bandwidths and spectral resolutions of @xmath45 mhz ( @xmath46km@xmath47s@xmath48 ) and @xmath49khz ( @xmath39km@xmath47s@xmath48 ) , and two filterbanks which have bandwidths and spectral resolutions of 1.024@xmath47ghz ( @xmath50km@xmath47s@xmath48 ) and @xmath51mhz ( @xmath52km@xmath47s@xmath48 ) , respectively .",
    "most of the data used for the analysis in this paper were taken with the aos - c and the chirp transform spectrometers ( cts - a ) , which have bandwidths and channel widths of @xmath53mhz ( @xmath54km@xmath47s@xmath48 ) and @xmath55khz ( @xmath56km@xmath47s@xmath48 ) and @xmath57mhz ( @xmath58km@xmath47s@xmath48 ) and @xmath59khz ( @xmath60km@xmath47s@xmath48 ) , respectively .",
    "the aos - c bandwidth does not cover all @xmath3components of the ch@xmath0cn j=12 @xmath1 11 transition , hence we centered this backend on the @xmath42 component .",
    "this setup allowed us to observe the @xmath61 components simultaneously .",
    "the aos - a and aos - b and the filterbanks offer bandwidths between @xmath62 and @xmath63mhz so in principle the higher @xmath3components could be detected . in practice , however , the lower line strengths of the higher components prevented us from detecting them in all but the strongest source , g34.26 + 0.15 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath64co j=2 @xmath1 1 transition blends with the @xmath65 component of the ch@xmath0cn j=12 @xmath1 11 transition , thus limiting the usefulness of this @xmath3component .",
    "the @xmath66co j=2 @xmath1 1 transition located in the upper sideband ( usb ) contaminated the lower sideband data approximately 50 mhz away from the ch@xmath0cn j=12 @xmath1 11 @xmath67 line . with the exception of g28.87 + 0.07 , this contamination had little effect on the quality of our data .",
    "the usb rejection was approximately @xmath68db over the course of our observations . given the relatively weak appearance of the @xmath66co j=2 @xmath1 1 line ( normally a very strong line ) in our spectra , we do not believe that there is significant contamination from other spectral lines located in the usb .",
    "our observations were conducted using double beam switching with a switch rate of @xmath69hz and a beamthrow of 2with a total on / off cycle of approximately 6 minutes per scan .",
    "system temperatures ranged from 350k to just under 200k with an average temperature of 212k .",
    "focus corrections were obtained from observations of jupiter .",
    "whenever possible we also derived pointing corrections from cross scans of jupiter .",
    "when jupiter was not available or was located at a large angular distance from the target source , pointing corrections were made by observing asymptotic giant branch stars in the co j=2 @xmath1 1 transition falling in the usb . in the case of iras 20126 + 4104 we could line point using the @xmath64co j=1 @xmath1 0 emission from the source .    at the beginning of each night of observations , we observed the strong source g34.26 + 0.15 for at least one scan to check for day - to - day consistency of our observations and to obtain a template source to identify contaminating spectral lines .",
    "subsequently , all sources were observed for 1218 minutes to determine the intensity of the @xmath3components of the ch@xmath0cn j=12 @xmath1 11 transition .",
    "promising sources were then re - observed for at least 2 hr .",
    "additionally , we obtained full beam spaced cross scans for five sources , typically with @xmath70hr spent at each offset position .",
    "the data were reduced in class , which is part of the gildas software package .",
    "all spectra were first inspected to check for bad channels or any obvious artifacts ; bad scans were discarded .",
    "subsequently , we subtracted baselines using low order polynomials , and initially averaged the spectra for each spectrometer and each day separately . after further inspection",
    ", all data taken on different days were averaged to form a final data set for each source .",
    "after hanning smoothing and resampling to the same spectral resolution , we averaged the aos - c and cts - a spectrometer data",
    ". we will refer to the latter data set as ` high resolution ' spectra .",
    "the data were calibrated using the chopper - wheel method and the antenna temperature was converted to main - beam brightness temperature by dividing the antenna temperature by the main - beam efficiency of the telescope ( @xmath71 ) .    using the daily spectra of the strong source g34.26 + 0.15",
    ", we checked our data for amplitude stability , which maximum deviation from the average was found to be smaller than @xmath72 .",
    "measured line widths had maximum deviations of @xmath73 , and the repeatability of measured frequencies , as well as the linearity of the spectrometers , was better than @xmath74 .",
    "we have three common sources with @xcite , who observed the same ch@xmath75cn transition with the smt , albeit with a different receiver .",
    "these three sources are g34.26 + 0.15 , iras 23139 + 5939 and iras 23385 + 6053 , the latter two being non - detections by us as well .",
    "the results of our line fitting of g34.26 + 0.15 agree very well with the spectrum of the same source shown in @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , we obtained spectra of the strong source g34.26 + 0.15 to study possible line contamination of the ch@xmath0cn j=12 @xmath1 11 transition . in figure [ f1 ]",
    "we show the full @xmath51ghz bandpass for this source .",
    "in addition to the @xmath3components of the ch@xmath0cn j=12 @xmath1 11 transition many other molecular lines were detected .",
    "we used the jpl molecular spectroscopy catalog @xcite in conjunction with the cologne database for molecular spectroscopy ( cdms , ) to identify the detected lines .",
    "in some cases there was a high level of ambiguity in the identities of the spectral lines . in these cases , molecules that were unambiguously detected elsewhere in the bandpass",
    "were preferentially chosen .",
    "lines that we were unable to identify are labeled as `` u '' for unknown lines and are numbered according to their order of appearance .",
    "over 60 lines were identified across the full bandpass and we have detections in the ch@xmath0cn j=12 @xmath1 11 transition up to @xmath76 .",
    "the same transitions in the isotopologue ch@xmath77cn were also detected , possibly out to @xmath65 . in the case of this isotopologue the @xmath78 and 3 components and the @xmath79 and higher components",
    "are blended with other lines .",
    "absorption features are observed around the @xmath64co j= 2 @xmath1 1 line ; these features are possible artifacts arising from @xmath64co emission in the off - beam , and the line identifications in this area of the spectrum are tentative at best .    from inspection of figure [ f1 ] , we conclude that the ch@xmath0cn j=12 @xmath1 11 @xmath80  4 , 7 , 8 , and 10 suffer no significant contamination but the @xmath81 , 6 components suffer some blending with lines from other molecular species .",
    "the @xmath65 component is rendered useless by overlap with the @xmath64co@xmath82 line . in the analysis that follows we use the @xmath81 , 6 components only when we are confident that we can reasonably separate them from the other lines ; the @xmath65 component we do not use at all .",

    "the ratio was calculated based on the abundance variation with galacto - centric distance .    for the other targets ,",
    "no reliable detection of isotopologue lines was made , therefore a detailed analysis correcting for optical depth effects was not feasible . if the assumption of optically thin conditions is incorrect , the derived temperature values are overestimated , and the column density underestimated .",
    "however , optical depths effects will not affect our principal result that relatively hot molecular gas is present in our targets .",
    "the above analysis of the physical parameters assumed uniform conditions in the emitting gas .",
    "this is clearly a simplification , as in most cases one would expect gradients in the density and temperature .",
    "allowing for non - uniformity in these parameters is not possible with the present low angular resolution data , however we consider here whether kinematic features can be detected in the ch@xmath0cn lines .",
    "our data in principle allow us to check for gradients in line velocity and/or line width . for most of our sources",

    "figures [ f5 ] and [ f6 ] show plots of velocity and line - width as a function of the upper level energy . from figure [ f5 ]",
    "there appears to be a trend in velocity for g16.59@xmath1000.05 , g34.26 + 0.15 , iras 18566 + 0408 , and iras 20126 + 4104 . in all cases the putative velocity gradient is towards lower velocity with increasing upper state energy",
    "the situation for the line - widths ( figure [ f6 ] ) is less clear .",
    "weak evidence for increasing line width towards higher energies is present in iras 18264@xmath1001152 , and g23.01@xmath1000.41 , whereas the opposite trend is seen in iras 20126@xmath954104 .",
    "we comment further on these findings in the next section .",
    "we have used the 10 m smt to search for ch@xmath0cn emission toward 21 regions of massive star formation .",
    "all of the regions ( except for g34.26@xmath950.15 ) are clearly in an evolutionary phase prior to that of uc or hc hii regions .",
    "we detected nine sources in the ch@xmath0cn j=12 @xmath1 11 transition . for six of these sources",
    "this is the first detection in this transition .",
    "the low detection rate is likely due to the limited sensitivity of a single dish telescope with the relatively small aperture of @xmath2 m .",
    "our cross scans for 5 sources show that the @xmath101 are occasionally detected outside the central beam , but the higher @xmath3components are always compact with respect to our angular resolution .",
    "this is consistent with a warm ( t@xmath102k ) , extended envelope which surrounds a much smaller and hotter ( t@xmath103k ) region near the massive star .",
    "this finding is consistent with observations of other molecular transitions of lower excitation and critical density ( e.g. , nh@xmath0(1,1 ) ) which probe the more extended envelope .",
    "our data thus indicate the presence of gradients in temperature and density . hence , to obtain precise physical parameters interferometric observations are necessary .",
    "the single dish beam will receive emission from regions of different physical characteristics , and performing the simple technique of rotation diagram technique corresponds to obtaining average physical properties of the emitting gas .",
    "taking also into account a number of additional uncertainties intrinsic to single dish data analyzed with the rotation diagram method ( e.g. , @xcite ) it is difficult to compare our results with the of and @xcite .",
    "nonetheless we note that our results for the column densities ( @xmath104 @xmath6 ) are quite similar to what was obtained in these studies .",
    "however , our derived temperatures appear to be higher compared to the values of and @xcite .",
    "this might be related to the different evolutionary state of the target samples .",
    "observed many known uchii regions and the @xcite sample was selected from _ iras _",
    "colors typical of uchii regions , whereas our sample should represent a pre - uchii region evolutionary phase .",
    "higher s / n ratio data , which can put more stringent constraints on the optical depth in the lines will be required to verify this speculation .",
    "we conclude that all detected regions contain molecular gas with t@xmath105k and methyl cyanide column densities of approximately @xmath5@xmath6 . assuming a strongly enhanced ch@xmath0cn abundance of @xmath106 the hydrogen column density in these regions on a scale of @xmath93 , is then approximately @xmath107@xmath6 .",
    "these numbers are consistent with the hmc nature of the detected sources .",
    "if the core is heated from the center , then lower @xmath3component emission arises predominantly from outer , and hence cooler regions and higher @xmath3components will dominate in the inner , hotter regions .",
    "consequently , velocity gradients in the @xmath3ladder components can trace radial dynamics and possible kinematic scenarios may be either collapse , outflows , expansion or rotation ( e.g , , @xcite ) .",
    "we have searched our high resolution spectra for evidence of systematic variation in velocity or line - width as a function of excitation energies .    a small number of kinematic analyses in ch@xmath0cn has been done but often no conclusive results have been found due to spectral resolution or s / n limitations .",
    "for instance , did not find any reliable trend in their results .",
    "on the other hand , observed iras@xmath4720126@xmath954104 using the iram plateau de bure interferometer .",
    "these authors reported an increase in the velocity and line - width toward the center of the core .",
    "they suggested that this behavior may be due to rotation of a keplerian disk surrounding an embedded massive protostar .",
    "our results for this same region show a decrease in the velocity and the line - width toward the center , contrary to the results obtained by .",
    "a possible explanation for this discrepancy is the much larger beam of the smt which will include more extended gas than the observations of .",
    "we detected an increasing blue - shift , i.e. , toward lower velocities with higher @xmath3component for four sources .",
    "this trend could be explained by expansion or outflow motion as seen in an optically thick line .",
    "another explanation for this behavior could be self absorption of an infalling molecular core which causes a blue asymmetry in an optically thick line .",
    "however with the given s / n ratio of our spectra we can not clearly distinguish these scenarios .",
    "a further complication that we can not address is the multiple core scenario . in this case , the cores have some dispersion of radial velocities that may be unresolved in the beam .",
    "therefore , to correctly interpret the detected velocity trends , further observations with higher s / n and angular resolution are needed .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     most of the hmcs observed in this paper are associated with bright _ iras _ sources , indicating that a massive object has already heated the surrounding matter . in figure [ f7 ]",
    "we show mid - infrared images of six sources for which _",
    "spitzer glimpse_/irac data are available . for five out of these six sources",
    "there is evidence for extended @xmath108 m excess emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of an extended @xmath108 m excess is generally thought to be caused by emission of high excitation lines from the h@xmath41 molecule , and is hence an indicator of shocked gas .",
    "also , five out of the six sources shown in figure [ f7 ] have strong mid - ir sources , which clearly shows that at least these hmcs have already formed massive stars which cause substantial heating of the molecular cores .",
    "one source , g25.83@xmath1000.18 , shows only a dark cloud at the suspected position of the massive protostar .",
    "this source also harbors one of the few 6 cm h@xmath99co masers known @xcite .",
    "we note that this source shows quite strong ch@xmath0cn emission , and since this molecule is thought be effectively formed only with the presence of an energy source , it is likely that a massive protostar is present in this dark cloud also .",
    "it is tempting then to speculate that due to the different mid - ir properties g25.83@xmath1000.18 is in an earlier evolutionary state compared to the other sources which have very bright mid - ir emission .",
    "however , using the extinction curve of we find that hydrogen column densities of @xmath109@xmath6 could render a possible mid - ir source undetectable .",
    "since hydrogen column densities of this order , and larger , are common in massive star forming cores , it is conceivable that the different mid - ir appearance of g25.83@xmath1000.18 is caused by extinction .",
    "we have observed a sample of 21 massive proto - stellar candidates in the ch@xmath0cn j=12 @xmath1 11 transition using the 10 m smt .",
    "we detected methyl cyanide in nine of the sources of the sample .",
    "rotation temperatures and column densities were estimated using the population diagram technique . detected",
    "sources have temperatures @xmath11050 k and column densities of @xmath111 @xmath6 , hence they are consistent with hmc nature .",
