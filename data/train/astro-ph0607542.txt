    "the mass function of galaxy clusters has long been recognized as the most convenient and important indicator for probing the evolution of structure formation , thereby helping determine the cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition , the cluster halo mass , when combined with the cluster gas mass via the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , provides the opportunity for probing the cluster baryon fraction ( umetsu , et al .",
    "conventional techniques , such as measuring the velocity dispersion of gravitationally bound galaxies and the x - ray emission profile , have long been employed to measure the cluster mass , assuming cluster galaxies and x - ray emitting plasmas to be dynamically relaxed within the cluster gravitational potential .    on the other hand ,",
    "the new technique of mass measurement through weak gravitational lensing has been gaining popularity in recent years , with the advantage of not having to assume the dynamical equilibrium in the cluster ( e.g. , umetsu , tada , & futamase 1999 ; bartelmann & schneider 2001 ; schneider 2005 ) . this methodology",
    "was first pioneered by tyson et al .",
    "various refined techniques for the weak - lensing mass determination were later proposed by several groups ( fahlman et al .",

    "the @xmath7statistic was particularly devised to measure the lens mass directly from the tangential component of local gravitational image distortions without involving a non - local mass reconstruction ( fahlman et al .",

    "schneider ( 1996 ) extended the @xmath0-statistic by generalizing its kernel , which allows one to define an optimal measure for the detection of mass concentrations , and this aperture mass technique has been applied to deep optical imaging data to search for clusters ( e.g. , erben et al .",

    "clowe et al . (",
    "2004 ) studied the effect of asphericity on the cluster mass determination , and concluded , under the assumption of an nfw profile , that the asphericality effect generally changes the mass estimate by @xmath9 to @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , several authors have compared the weak - lensing mass with the mass determined by the galaxy kinematics and x - ray observations .",

    "it was found that among all , two clusters are in strong discrepancy , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , whereas the rest are in fair agreement , with @xmath18 . though these exceptional clusters may be in dynamical non - equilibrium , another possibility may arise from the projection effects of other mass concentrations ( cen 1997 ; reblinsky & bartelmann 1999 ; white , van waerbeke , & mackey 2002 ; padmanabhan , seljak , & pen 2003 ; hamana , takada , & yoshida 2004 ; henawi & spergel 2005 ) and/or local filamentary structures ( metzler et al . 1999 ; metzler , white , & loken 2001 ) along the line - of - sight . using @xmath19-body simulations white et al .",

    "metzler et al . ( 1999 ; 2001 ) studied the projection effects on weak - lensing mass estimates for massive clusters caused by the local large - scale filamentary structures . including the projection effects from local matter within a sphere of @xmath21 radius",
    ", they found the lensing convergence maps to yield an positive mass bias of @xmath22 and the mass error dispersion of @xmath23 for massive clusters at a redshift of @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , these problems of weak - lensing mass determination , i.e. , positive mass bias and large mass error dispersion , have been alluded in earlier works ( cen 1997 ; reblinsky & bartelmann 1999 ) .",
    "further , the cluster halo triaxiality itself can cause a bias in the lensing - based mass estimation ( clowe et al . 2004 ; hamana et al . 2004",
    "; oguri et al .",
    "2005 ) , while it is likely to have less effect on the x - ray cluster mass estimate ( gavazzi 2005 ) .",
    "thus , despite that weak lensing offers a unique tool for the measurement of cluster masses without any assumption of their equilibrium state , it can however suffer from the projection effects .",
    "such problems are less significant in x - ray or spectroscopic velocity - dispersion measurements .    the present study aims to investigate the errors in weak lensing cluster mass measurements as well",
    ". however , this work differs from the aforementioned previous works , in that we attempt to simulate the actual wide - field weak lensing measurements , with numerically simulated shear data as closely resembling the observing data as possible .",
    "in particular , we shall focus on the bias errors and random errors pertinent to local weak - lensing measurement of @xmath0-statistic .",
    "moreover , at a given observing depth , the finite number of background galaxies can introduce non - negligible poisson noise convolved with the projection error in the measured data .",
    "we shall quantify , in this work , the regime for which the projection effect dominates , and the other regime where the poisson noise dominates .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2",
    "we describe our cosmological @xmath19-body simulations , weak lensing simulations , and the construction of a mock cluster catalog .",
    "details of our shear - based mass estimator and mock observations are presented in sect .",
    "3 . in sect .",
    "4 we apply the shear - based mass estimator to our simulated weak lensing observations , and examine the statistical properties of the errors in weak lensing cluster mass estimates .",
    "the radial mass error profiles are discussed in sect .",
    "based on the radial error profiles , we propose a plausible alternative cluster mass indicator that has much reduced error dispersion .",
    "we finally present the discussions and a summary in sect .",
    "we use the gadget code ( springel et al . 2001 ) to run 10 sets of independent simulations with @xmath25 dark matter particles for a @xmath26cdm model in a @xmath27 mpc cubic box .",
    "the cosmological parameters are @xmath28 , @xmath29 , the hubble parameter @xmath30 , and the linear mass fluctuation amplitude @xmath31 .",
    "the mass resolution is @xmath32 per particle .",
    "we also conduct one simulation of 8 times higher mass resolution with the same initial condition for checking the convergence of the result .",
    "general methods of backward ray - tracing have been detailed in wambsganss et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and jain , seljak , & white ( 2000 ) . in the present study ,",
    "on the other hand , we adopt a simpler linear approximation for the investigation of weak gravitational lensing . the shear matrices are generated on every lens plane with @xmath33 resolution , and we trace uniform @xmath34 rays backwards from the observer plane ( @xmath35 ) to the source plane ( @xmath36 ) . in the weak lensing approximation that employs the born approximation , each photon travels along the un - perturbed trajectory , and the accumulated shear is the linear combination of gravitational shear given by every lens plane . throughout this paper , we adopt a single source plane located at @xmath37 , which is the typical value for the mean redshift of background galaxies in an actual weak lensing survey with limiting magnitude @xmath38 mag ( see hamana et al .",
    "we then randomly choose a @xmath39 field of view from the large projected simulation cubic box , and generate 36 lensing maps of @xmath39 from each simulation .",
    "ten sets of independent @xmath40 cosmological simulations were used to avoid the same clusters to be observed repetitively .",
    "hence , the effective survey area is @xmath41 .    to make sure the difference between @xmath25-particle simulation and @xmath42-particle simulation indeed negligible for cluster mass measurement , we compare @xmath42-particle simulation with @xmath25-particle simulation of the same initial condition for the weak lensing estimation of cluster mass .",
    "it is found that two results are almost indistinguishable , for the following reason : the resolution of cluster mass estimation is limited by the finite galaxy number density , @xmath43 galaxies per arcmin@xmath44 which corresponds to the grid resolution of about @xmath45 per deg@xmath44 . on the other hand , even a small cluster of @xmath46 of redshift @xmath47 contains @xmath48 particles within a projected area of 10 arcmin@xmath44 . the ten - times higher dark - matter particle number density than the background galaxy number density already warrants little clumpiness in mass distribution to arise from the discrete particle effect , thereby ensuring correct mass estimation even with lower resolution simulations .",
    "we use the friends - of - friends algorithm ( huchra & geller 1982 ) with linking - length 0.2 to search for clusters . after a cluster",
    "is identified , the center of mass position @xmath49 is then computed .",
    "we define the @xmath2 of a cluster by increasing the enclosing spherical radius around the cluster center @xmath49 till it satisfies the criterion of @xmath50 , within which the mean interior density is 200 times the mean density @xmath51 of the universe at the cluster redshift .",
    "similarly , we define the cluster mass enclosed within @xmath52 by @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the mean overdensity within @xmath52 with respect to @xmath55 .    in the end",
    ", we project the 3-d @xmath49 to obtain the projected cluster center , , and the projected @xmath50 to @xmath56 , respectively . the peak position in the 2-d lensing map dose",
    "not necessarily coincide the center of mass position determined in 3-d particle simulation , especially in the case where the halo in 2-d projection contains substructures or mergers . from the observational viewpoint",
    ", the cluster center can be chosen from the local surface density peak .",
    "nevertheless , we expect the difference not to be so serious as to affect the statistics of our mass estimate , since the difference between two centers is small compared with the inner most radius where the cluster mass estimate is made .    through the above procedure",
    ", we obtain a mass - selected sample of about 4000 clusters with @xmath57 between lens redshifts @xmath47 to @xmath58 in our effective survey area @xmath59 .",
    "repeating clusters do occur in our randomly rendered maps but only at different cluster orientations and with different background and foreground lenses .",
    "for the purpose of the present work , which focuses on the measurement errors , repeating clusters can be regarded as independent samples since the noise is different .",
    "our method for cluster mass estimation is based on the gravitational shear field , which is different from the method based on the convergence field used by metzler et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and white et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . using",
    "the tangential component of galaxy shear for a lensing mass determination is often a preferred one , since it makes direct use of the locally observed galaxy ellipticities around the target cluster and is widely adopted in recent observations ( clowe et al .",
    "2006 ; bardeau et al . 2005 ; jee et al .",
    "by contrast , the convergence - based method involves non - local mass reconstruction from the observation of galaxy ellipticities over a large field .",
    "mathematically , the two methods are equivalent , and both exhibit the mass - sheet degeneracy . but in practice the local shear - field measurement has one additional degree of freedom in choosing an appropriate nearby control field as the background mass sheet to be subtracted .      we begin by briefly summarizing the basic formalism of weak gravitational lensing .",
    "a general review of weak lensing can be found in bartelmann & schneider ( 2001 ) .",
    "the deformation of an infinitesimal ray bundle due to gravitational deflection is described by a mapping between the two - dimensional source plane and the image plane as @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote the angular position on the source and the image plane , respectively , and @xmath63 is the @xmath64 jacobian matrix of the lens equation . in the weak lensing regime ,",
    "the jacobian matrix @xmath63 is symmetric and can be decomposed as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the shear matrix defined as @xmath67 with @xmath68 being the components of complex gravitational shear @xmath69 , @xmath70 being the @xmath64 pauli matrices , and @xmath71 being the lensing convergence responsible for the trace - part of the jacobian matrix .",
    "the lensing convergence @xmath71 is a line - of - sight projection of the matter density contrast @xmath72 out to the source plane @xmath73 weighted by certain combination @xmath74 of comoving angular - diameter distances ( e.g. , jain et al . 2000 ) , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the cosmic scale factor , and @xmath77 is the co - moving distance ; @xmath78 is the matter surface density @xmath79 with respect to the cosmic mean density , and @xmath80 is the critical surface mass density of gravitational lensing , @xmath81 with @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 being the angular - diameter distances from the observer to the lens , from the observer to the source , and from the lens to the source , respectively .",
    "the gravitational shear field is related with the lensing convergence field in a non - local manner ( e.g. , bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath71 and @xmath85 is expressed in fourier space as ( kaiser & squires 1993 ) @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the fourier transform of @xmath88 , @xmath89 is the fourier transform of @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is the fourier variable conjugate to the angular position @xmath62 on the sky . equations ( [ eq : k2g1 ] ) and ( [ eq : k2g2 ] ) can be used to invert the gravitational shear field to the lensing convergence field .",
    "jee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) performed a weak lensing analysis on a @xmath92 cluster , and found the mass estimate obtained from the aperture densitometry ( fahlman et al .",
    "1994 ) , or so - called the @xmath0-statistic , to be very close to that obtained from the nonlinear iteration - convolution method of kaiser & squires ( 1993 ) .",
    "they also investigated the @xmath7statistic within a projected aperture of @xmath93 , where the weak lensing assumption almost breaks down , and showed only about @xmath94 mass error .",
    "although the @xmath0-statistic can be accurate from the linear regime to the weakly nonlinear regime , this method however can not avoid the projection effect arising from the foreground and background matter along the line - of - sight . in what follows , the mass errors caused by projection as well as other error sources will be quantified .",
    "the observed image distortion of background galaxies can be directly used to derive the projected gravitational mass of clusters .",
    "the aperture mass estimate within the angular radius @xmath95 , @xmath96 , in terms of the tangential component @xmath97 of gravitational shear can be expressed as @xmath98 using the @xmath0-statistic defined as @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the azimuthal average , and @xmath101 is the mean convergence .",
    "equations ( [ eq : zetamass ] ) and ( [ eq : zetastat ] ) show that the cluster mass can be measured from the galaxies ellipticity within the annulus bounded by @xmath95 and @xmath102 located just outside the mass to be measured .    as revealed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zetastat ] ) , the @xmath7statistic yields the mean convergence interior to @xmath95 , subtracted by the mean background within the annulus between @xmath95 and @xmath102 , @xmath103 . hence ,",
    "as long as @xmath104 , the enclosed mass within @xmath95 can be obtained by multiplying @xmath0 by the area @xmath105 . as the inner radius @xmath95 can almost be arbitrarily chosen to obtain the aperture mass within @xmath95 ,",
    "when @xmath95 is chosen to be @xmath56 , the aperture mass @xmath106 is approximately the cluster mass , @xmath2 .",
    "obviously , the aperture mass is smaller than the enclosed mass by a negative compensating mass that serves to remove the contribution from a background uniform mass sheet , and the degree of deviation depends on how steep the density profile is . in  4.3 ,",
    "we will demonstrate empirically that the negative compensating mass can actually correct for the systematic positive bias resulting from the projection effect .",
    "the @xmath0-statistic is a spherically symmetric mass estimator .",
    "it gives rise to some errors for the typically irregular cluster .",
    "nevertheless , this effect has been estimated less than @xmath8 ( clowe et al .",
    "2004 ) . to avoid this effect to influence our cluster mass estimation ,",
    "the number of clusters in the sample is crucial .",
    "our sample of @xmath107 clusters contains clusters of different sizes and shapes , and the effect of non - spherical lens is expected to average out .",
    "moreover , to avoid strong lensing , our mass estimator avoids the shear measurement near the cluster center ( see  4.4 ) .",
    "the choice of the parameter @xmath102 may also affect the cluster mass estimate .",
    "for example , a small @xmath102 will generate large poisson noise since the galaxy number for shear estimate within the annulus bound by @xmath95 and @xmath102 is not sufficiently large . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath102 is too large , the cluster mass measurement can be contaminated by the neighboring clusters in a crowded field . in practice , we nevertheless obtain similar results for @xmath108 and @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",

    "the underestimated mass can become negative .",

    "[ fig : negativemass ] and [ fig : overestimatemass ] have fields of view of @xmath115 defined by the central objects .",
    "peculiar clusters of this kind are included in our raw sample of 4000 clusters .",
    "another important factor that strongly influences the mass measurement is the galaxy intrinsic ellipticity , which plays a role as random noise in the shear measurement . in the weak lensing regime ,",
    "the shear induced by gravitational lensing is some slight distortion of galaxy images , e.g. , @xmath8 distortion for cluster lenses .",
    "however , individual galaxies have an intrinsic ellipticity of random orientation with considerable dispersion , about @xmath116 .",
    "such orientation noise can only be reduced by taking average over some sufficiently large projected area around the lens .    in our simulation ,",
    "the two components of the complex galaxy intrinsic ellipticity , @xmath117 @xmath118 , are generated by gaussian random numbers with dispersion @xmath119 per component . in the weak lensing approximation where @xmath120 and @xmath121 , the net ellipticity @xmath122 is a linear combination of galaxy intrinsic ellipticity @xmath117 and gravitational shear @xmath123 , that is , @xmath124 in what follows",
    ", we assume a weak lensing survey of mean galaxy surface number density , @xmath125 arcmin@xmath126 , and intrinsic ellipticity dispersion , @xmath127 , in our simulations .      given a finite number of sample clusters in the simulation , we focus on those clusters that can produce sufficiently strong signals for the weak - lensing mass determination .",
    "this issue is important in the context of this study , as we are interested in the observational uncertainties in the cluster mass determination .",
    "clusters of unsuitable mass and redshift ranges will yield unreasonably high uncertainties to provide useful astrophysics information .",
    "our sample of clusters is selected based on the mass ( e.g. , white et al .",
    "2002 ) , whereas practical weak lensing samples of clusters are `` shear - selected '' , that is , weighted by both the mass and the redshift ( e.g. , reblinsky & bartelmann 1999 ; hamana et al .",
    "a concise overview of how clusters of viable mass redshift ranges are determined is given below .",
    "it provides a criterion for us to select those `` clean '' clusters from 4000 clusters in the raw sample .",
    "typical cluster search schemes use the convergence map instead of the shear map ( e.g. , white et al . 2002 ; padmanabhan et al .",

    "an optimal choice for the threshold @xmath132 depends on the concentration parameter of the nfw profile , @xmath133 , the cluster mass @xmath134 and the lens redshift @xmath135 .",

    "we conduct a simple - minded `` clean sample '' procedure , which removes those clusters from our raw sample that obviously contain nearby objects in the convergence map , and/or those clusters whose mass is below a redshift - dependent limiting mass (  4.2 ) .",
    "we nevertheless note that even in the clean sample , mass estimates from the @xmath0-statistic still contain residual mass errors due to local filamentary structures around the target cluster as well as intervening large - scale fluctuations ( i.e. , cosmic shear ) projected along the line - of - sight , as shown in fig .",

    "the noise - free case contains measurement errors due solely to the projection effect , and the mass probability function is positively skewed with a tail .",
    "nevertheless , we find the peak at @xmath162 @xmath163 , which is in agreement with white et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the noisy case contains contaminations from both projection and galaxy ellipticity effects .",
    "the random gaussian noise due to intrinsic galaxy ellipticities adds substantial errors to the gravitational shear estimate , giving rise to a mass probability function considerably more symmetric and broader than the noise - free case .    the error bars in both figs .",
    "[ fig : massfreeprobred ] and [ fig : massnoiseprobred ] represent the intervals of @xmath164 confidence .",

    "n can be improved in a predictable manner as @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the number of background galaxies used to determine the cluster mass .",
    "hence , high - redshift clusters , being smaller in angular size , have noisier mass estimates than low redshift clusters . furthermore ,",

    "we apply a `` clean '' procedure to the raw cluster sample (  4.1 ) in order to remove clusters that would yield unreliable mass estimates from the @xmath0-statistic mass estimator (  3.1 ) .",

    "table [ table : cleanclusternumber ] shows the cluster numbers of the clean sample in different mass and redshift bins , as well as the percentage of removed clusters that have genuinely nearby contaminants in the physical space .",
    "the clean procedure reduces the projection effect in the shear - based cluster mass estimate , and the benefit of `` clean '' is found to be only moderate as revealed by the error dispersions of the clean sample in table [ table : cleansigma ] .",
    "a comparison between tables [ table : rawsigma ] and [ table : cleansigma ] shows that the clean sample has @xmath175 improvement for the least massive clusters of low - redshift to to @xmath176 for the most massive clusters of high - redshift in the noise - free error dispersion .",
    "when observational noise due to intrinsic galaxy ellipticities is included , the clean sample is at most @xmath177 better in error dispersion .",
    "such a result can not be considered to be satisfactory .",
    "clearly , there is still much room for improvement in error reduction",
    ". this will be the subject of  4.4 and 4.5 .",
    "figure [ fig : massprobdiag ] depicts the mass probability distribution functions @xmath178 of @xmath179 in noisy and noise - free simulations for different mass - bins and redshift - intervals derived from the clean sample .",
    "the statistical properties of a probability function can be characterized by its distribution moments , such as the mean , the dispersion , the skewness , and other higher - order moments .",
    "we compute these first three moments to quantity the mass probability function for the 3 mass bins and 3 redshift intervals .",
    "the results are listed in tables [ table : cleansigma ] , [ table : cleanmean ] and [ table : cleanskewness ] .",
    "the mass probability function tends to have a positive tail and be asymmetric .",
    "the positive offset can be characterized by the skewness @xmath180 tabulated in table [ table : cleanskewness ] .",
    "the skewness is defined to be the third moment of the distribution function : @xmath181 .",
    "this parameter is a measure of non - gaussianity originated from the projection effect , since the contaminant lenses are non - gaussian .",
    "however , inclusion of the galaxy ellipticity noise substantially reduces the skewness , thus making the mass probability function more symmetrical about the peak .    note from table [ table : cleanmean ] that the mean is found to be only slightly greater than the peak ( @xmath163 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massprobdiag ] as a result of the small positive skewness of the distribution . to be specific",
    ", the mean has a positive bias of less than @xmath8 for clusters of all mass and redshift ranges in our clean sample .",
    "moreover , the positive bias increases only slightly with increasing lens redshift . the fact that the @xmath0-statistic mass estimator has a small bias is surprising , since it is at variance with a previous study .",
    "white et al . ( 2002 ) adopted to use the convergence map for a weak - lensing mass measurement , and showed a @xmath182 positive mass bias for massive clusters of intermediate redshifts .",
    "such a positive bias results from the projection effect by local large - scale structures surrounding the target galaxy cluster that accounts for an additional @xmath182@xmath177 lensing strength ( metzler et al . 1999 ; metzler et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath71-based mass measurement , the local shear - based mass measurement with @xmath0-statistic turns out to have a compensating effect to neutralize the anticipated positive bias .",
    "weak lensing measurements are subject to the mass - sheet degeneracy ( bradac et al .",
    "2004 ) , which renders the uniform background matter undetectable .",
    "in the @xmath71-based mass measurement , the overall field tends to be so large as to permit an accurate global inversion of the convergence field .",
    "the background so defined is therefore the global background over a large field . on the other hand ,",
    "the shear - based measurement is a local measurement and the background matter density is defined only locally in the projection space . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zetastat ] ) is exactly the local background surface density defined over a control field within an annulus just outside the target field .",
    "hence while the environment surrounding the cluster is rich in matter , the matter density in the control field just outside the aperture of the target field can be correspondingly high as to cancel the enhanced background contribution along the line - of - sight of the target field .",
    "the cancellation significantly reduces the positive bias of the lensing mass .    to show the cancellation of the bias , we compute the ratio of the noise - free local mass @xmath183 , contained in the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zetastat ] ) , to the true cluster mass @xmath149 , where all matter outside @xmath184mpc from the target cluster has been excluded for examination of the local contribution to the projection effect . here",
    "we take @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "table [ table : annuluskappas ] shows the means and the variances of this ratio for all clusters in the clean sample .",
    "the mean ratio ranges from @xmath187 to @xmath188 with a considerably small variance .",
    "indeed , the mean ratio has a correct value to largely cancel the well - known mass over - estimation of @xmath189 produced by the local projection effect ( metzler et al .",
    "1999 ; metzler et al . 2001",
    "; white et al . 2002 ) .",
    "this result quantitatively demonstrates the self - cancellation of two environmental contributions to be at work with @xmath0-statistic .",
    "the possibility of such a cancellation was previously alluded by metzler et al ( 1999 ) , but the small number of sample clusters prevented them from drawing a quantitative conclusion .",
    "coming back to table [ table : cleansigma ] , we find the error dispersion for the noise - free case tends to be small at redshift intervals in between @xmath190 .",
    "this is because the source galaxy redshift @xmath37 favors lensing signals from this lens redshift .",
    "the noise - free result for the high mass bin , @xmath148 , at @xmath191 can be compared with the result of metzler et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for @xmath24 .",
    "they obtained an error dispersion @xmath192 in the ratio between the estimated @xmath2 and the true @xmath2 , which is in good agreement with the noise - free error dispersion in our clean sample , @xmath193 . on the other hand , for the noisy case , the smallest error dispersion occurs at lens redshift interval @xmath194 .",
    "it means that the errors contributed by galaxy ellipticity noise is significant , and the larger angular size of low-@xmath6 lens , having a larger sampling annulus , helps reduce the sampling noise .",
    "table [ table : cleansigma ] also shows that the cluster mass measurement errors can be significantly enhanced by the galaxy ellipticity noise by more than almost @xmath176 for all lenses , except for the highest mass and lowest redshift bin .",
    "this indicates that the dominant error source in the weak lensing @xmath2 can be the galaxy ellipticity .",
    "this finding motivates us to proceed on seeking an alternative mass estimator below .",
    "we turn to the radial profile @xmath195 , measured for individual clusters of the clean sample .",
    "we fix the outer radius @xmath102 to be @xmath174 and vary the mass - aperture radius @xmath95 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : massratiodiag ] for the noise - free and noisy cases .",
    "the innermost radius is chosen to be @xmath196 so as to stay in the observationally weak - lensing regime . for a typical cluster in our clean sample ,",
    "@xmath50 @xmath197 and the innermost radius limit is about @xmath198 , which is mostly outside the scaling radius of the nfw profile .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig : massratiodiag ] represent @xmath199 confidence levels around the estimated mean @xmath200 , obtained over 20 independent background realizations similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : massnoiseprobred ] .",
    "the deviation of the mean-@xmath162 from unity indicates a systematic bias .",
    "very little systematic bias is detected interior to @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ fig : massratiodiag ] .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig : massratiodiag ] are seen to decrease with decreasing radius . in particular , the mass error caused by intrinsic galaxy ellipticities ( i.e. , the difference between error bars of noisy and noise - free cases ) decreases mostly noticeably for @xmath201 .",
    "this feature arises from the peculiar feature of @xmath0-statistic , where the enclosed mass within a smaller radius is measured by a larger annulus .",
    "such an error stays relatively constant for @xmath202 , which can be understood from the geometry .",
    "the annulus area enhancement begins to saturate when the inner radius becomes smaller than half the outer radius .",
    "on the other hand , the projection errors continue to decrease at the ever decreasing radius .",
    "this trend can be understood from the second equality of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zetastat ] ) . for a small @xmath95 ,",
    "the interior convergence @xmath203 is much greater than the average convergence in the annulus @xmath204 , which contains lensing contributions of other redshifts .",
    "it therefore becomes increasingly insensitive to most contaminant lenses for a decreasing @xmath95 .",
    "section 4.3 already reveals the considerably large errors arising from galaxy ellipticity in the weak lensing mass measurements . on the other hand , sec .",
    "4.4 also shows that despite a sizable error in the measured @xmath2 , the error becomes substantially small for the fractional mass well within @xmath50 .",
    "this tendency has also been noticed by metzler et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and cen ( 1997 ) previously for noise - free mass estimations .    in order for the weak - lensing measurement to yield a reliable cluster mass estimate ,",
    "we seek an alternative mass estimator that is contaminated by the ellipticity noise and the projection effect to a much lesser degree . in table",
    "[ table : cleansigma500 ] , we enlist the ever - decreasing mass errors for the 2d projected mass measured over the decreasing radii , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 . here",
    "@xmath208 is the projected angular radius of the 3d interior mass @xmath209 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : m200 ] ) . these radii correspond , on average , to @xmath210 , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 ,",
    "respectively , in weak dependence on the lens mass and redshift . projected masses evaluated at these radii contain significantly smaller errors than @xmath2 , and may serve as alternative mass indicators .",
    "a similar proposal was put forth for the mass estimator of x - ray clusters . with cosmological simulations , evrard et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that x - ray mass estimates are remarkably accurate when evaluated at radii from @xmath213 to @xmath214 .",
    "recent x - ray observations measure the cluster mass at @xmath213 ( finoguenov et al . 2002 ) and at @xmath214 ( allen et al .",
    "moreover , jee et al .",
    "( 2005a ) compared the cluster mass profiles derived from x - ray and from weak lensing , and found increasing agreement with decreasing radii .",
    "the radius @xmath214 is about @xmath215 for our sample clusters .",
    "in fact , the mass within @xmath216 may be accurately measured by weak lensing even at a lens redshift of @xmath217 , as discussed by jee et al .",
    ". however , the cluster mass within @xmath215 can be sensitive to the complex interior structures of a cluster , for example , containing two cores in a cluster recently undergoing a merger , and/or the baryonic physical processes such as radiative cooling and galaxy formation .",
    "moreover , for a dual - core cluster , @xmath214 can be ambiguous to define .",
    "we therefore suggest that @xmath4 be a better weak - lensing mass estimator . on one hand",
    ", it has an acceptable worst mass errors ( @xmath218 ) for the 3 mass bins and different redshift intervals , as revealed in table [ table : cleansigma500 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the radius is still sufficiently large , @xmath219 , so that the mass estimator can be insensitive to the cluster interior structures .",
    "finally , @xmath4 is a significant fraction of @xmath2 and it should still follow the well - known similarity scaling of the cdm gravitational collapse .",
    "this paper reports a systematic study on the accuracy of cluster mass measurements through weak lensing observations .",
    "specifically this work takes into account the mass errors introduced by the projection effect and by the poisson noise of finite number of randomly oriented background galaxies . among these sources of mass errors ,",
    "the projection effect has been reported to yield a non - negligible systematic positive bias ( @xmath220 ) in the cluster mass estimate based on weak lensing . adopting the local shear - field measurement using @xmath0-statistic , which is often used in actual observations",
    ", we nevertheless found that such a positive bias can be largely canceled by the positively - biased local background mass sheet .",
    "that is , the @xmath0-statistic measurement can provide a bias - free cluster mass estimate .    in this paper",
    ", we also report that the error in @xmath2 determination is expected to exceed @xmath176 even for a moderately deep observation ( @xmath38 mag ) , regardless of lens mass and redshift . even after a clean procedure that removes clusters with detectable companions in the projected map , the mass error is still substantial , exceeding @xmath221 for a @xmath38 observation .",
    "mass errors can scatter observed data of one mass bin into another bin when constructing the cluster mass function , and smear out the mass function . in the mass range where the mass function has a large gradient , i.e. , @xmath222 , such mass errors can greatly distort the mass function",
    ". the measurement error will eventually propagate into the determination of cosmological parameters , such as the matter density parameter @xmath223 and the matter fluctuation amplitude @xmath224 , which rely critically on an accurate mass function .",
    "the so - called self - calibration was devised to correct for the systematic errors of this kind ( hu 2003 ) , but the random errors are un - removable even with the self - calibration .    to significantly reduce the mass error in weak lensing measurements",
    ", we also suggest the possibility of an alternative lens mass , which has a considerably smaller error .",
    "it is an interior mass well inside @xmath56 .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : massratiodiag ] shows that the error in @xmath225 ( mass interior to approximately @xmath226 ) is already noticeably smaller than @xmath2 , the error dispersion of @xmath4 is at most @xmath5 for all detectable clusters and the error dispersion of @xmath227 at most @xmath228 .",
    "comparing table [ table : cleansigma500 ] with table [ table : cleansigma ] , we find @xmath229 to have more than a factor 2 in error reduction for all detectable clusters ; for low-@xmath6 lenses , the error reduction can be as large as a factor 3 .",
    "given these results , we suggest that @xmath4 be a better mass variable than @xmath2 for constructing the mass function .    concerning the mass function of @xmath4 , it should be reminded that the mass function of @xmath2 can not be analytically derived , and needs to be determined empirically from @xmath19-body simulations . from this spirit",
    ", the mass function of @xmath4 can also be obtained from @xmath19-body simulations , in a similar manner as the mass function of @xmath2 .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , there have not been investigations on the mass function for mass different from @xmath2 in literature .",
    "such a new class of mass function , containing less mass scatter than the conventional mass function , may be more useful for constraining the cosmological parameters . however , whether or not the more accurately measured @xmath4 function can actually be more useful than the less accurately measured @xmath2 function really depends on the detailed form of the @xmath4 function that contains the cosmology - parameter - sensitive feature , similar to a break at @xmath230 for the @xmath2 function",
    ". therefore our suggestion at this point in favor of an alternative mass estimator for a new mass function should be regarded as plausible but still preliminary .    finally ,",
    "though the depth of observation has been fixed to @xmath38 mag in this work for which @xmath231 arcmin@xmath126 , for evaluation of mass errors , we may relax this constraint to assess other observing depths straightforwardly . at a medium depth @xmath232 mag ,",
    "suitable for wide - field surveys , the background galaxy density @xmath233 arcmin@xmath126 ( fontana et al . 2000 ) .",

    "[ fig : massratiodiag ] with the poisson statistics that the galaxy ellipticity noise is still much less than the errors at @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 introduced by the projection effect for clusters of @xmath234 and @xmath235 and clusters of @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
