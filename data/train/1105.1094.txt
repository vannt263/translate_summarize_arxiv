    "in terms of size , the narrow - line region ( nlr ) of active galactic nuclei ( agns ; including seyfert galaxies and quasars ) represents the link between the inner structure of the agn  the dusty torus and the broad - line region ( blr)and the interstellar medium in the host galaxy .",
    "the nlr bridges the region dominated by the gravitational field of the central massive black hole and the region dominated by the gravitational potential of the bulge stars of the host galaxy . to gain a complete understanding of the agn phenomenon , the role of the nlr therefore needs to be understood . unlike the blr , the nlr , or at least the outer parts of the nlr , can be spatially resolved in nearby agns . despite this",
    ", however , the nlr remains remarkably poorly understood and there are many unanswered questions about the structure and kinematics of the nlr and its relationship to the blr / torus .",
    "[ oiii]@xmath0 is one of the most important nlr lines .",
    "its equivalent width ( ew ) in the agn ensemble varies dramatically by a factor of @xmath4 ( from @xmath5 to 157  ; baskin & laor 2005b ) , one of the things showing the most object - to - object variation in agns .",
    "it is a dominant variable in the set of correlations making up the first principal component ( commonly called `` eigenvector  1 '' ; ev1 ) in the principal component analysis of qso properties of boroson & green ( 1992 ) ; ev1 is believed to be linked to certain fundamental parameters of the accretion process .",
    "[ oiii ]  luminosity is commonly used as a surrogate for the bolometric luminosity ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "2004 ) and its doppler width as a surrogate for the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 ) of the host galaxy ( e.g. , nelson & whittle 1996 , wang & lu 2001 , komossa & xu 2007 , gaskell 2009a ) .    although the spatial distribution of [ oiii]-emitting gas in the nlr of agns is rather inhomogeneous ( see , e.g. , das et al .",
    "2006 , crenshaw et al .",
    "2010 ) , there are some global regularities in its strength and kinematics .",
    "its ew was found to correlate negatively , albeit with a large scatter , with the continuum luminosity ( grindlay et al .",
    "1980 , steiner 1981 , dietrich et al .",
    "2002 , kovacevic et al . 2010",
    "table  3 of dong et al .",
    "this is similar to the famous `` baldwin effect '' ( baldwin 1977 , baldwin et al .",
    "1978 ) first discovered for the broad civ@xmath7 line .",
    "the [ oiii ]  line profile can be regarded as consisting of two components : a narrow component ( hereinafter , the ` core ' ) with a velocity close to the systemic redshift of the host galaxy and a low , broad base that is usually blueshifted ( hereinafter , the ` wing ' ) .",
    "there is mounting evidence that the core component is a good tracer of the gravitational potential of the host galaxy bulge ( see , e.g. , gaskell 2009a and references therein ) while the wing component arises from agn outflows ( see , e.g. , crenshaw et al .",
    "2010 , komossa & xu 2007 and references therein ) . scattering could also be a contributor to broadening of the wings ( gaskell & goosmann 2008 ) .    besides these general global trends in the agn ensemble , there are some interesting peculiar [ oiii ]  phenomena that have been discovered in some particular agn subclasses . for instance , in narrow - line seyfert 1s ( nls1s ) that have broad h@xmath8  line with full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath9",
    "@xmath10  ( the `` population a '' of the eigenvector  1 domain , zamanov et al . [ 2002 ] ; see xu & komossa [ 2010 ] for a recent review ) , [ oiii]@xmath0 is generally very weak .",
    "moveover , in a small fraction of nls1s , the whole [ oiii]@xmath0 profile has a bulk velocity shift of @xmath11 @xmath10  blueward ( the so - called `` blue outliers '' , zamanov et al .",
    "2002 , boroson 2005 , zhou et al .",
    "2006 , komossa et al . 2008 ) and there seems to be no non - blueshifted component from a canonical nlr as seen in low - ionization lines ( komossa et al .",
    "komossa & xu ( 2007 ) found that although the width of the core component of [ oiii]@xmath0 is generally a good surrogate for @xmath6 , this however does not hold in `` blue outliers '' .",
    "it is an interesting question whether or not these various regularities and phenomena can be unified and this has been looked at by previous authors . for instance , zamanov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggested that `` blue outliers '' with extreme blue wing components originate in strong agn outflows , and moreover , are associated with the same outflows as the blue - shifted component of the broad civ@xmath12 emission line .",
    "the origin of the blueshifting of high - ionization broad emission lines such as civ@xmath12 remains a subject of debate .",
    "there is general agreement that there has to be a radial component of motion and some opacity source .",
    "gaskell ( 1982 ) proposed that the blueshifting was due to an outflow of the high - ionization gas and obscuration by the accretion disk .",
    "while this has remained the most popular model , it has the major problem that outflows of the dominant line - emitting gas seem to be strongly ruled out by velocity - resolved reverberation mapping ( gaskell 1988 , koratkar & gaskell 1989 , see gaskell 2009b for a review ) .",
    "gaskell & goosmann ( 2008 ) therefore argue that the blueshifting is due instead to scattering of photons by material with a net inward motion as suggested by corbin ( 1990 ) .",
    "observationally , the civ@xmath12 baldwin effect and blueshifting are related in the sense that higher - luminosity agns have both lower civ  ews and larger blueshifts ( corbin 1991 , 1992 ) .",
    "this is further supported by the study of richards et al .",
    "if this is also true for [ oiii]@xmath0 , we will gain important insights into the origin and kinematics of the nlr .",
    "it might point to similar underlying causes for the two effects in both the blr and nlr .",
    "meanwhile , understanding these effects should enable us to calibrate better the doppler widths and luminosities of [ oiii]@xmath0 to serve as proxies for the bulge gravitational potential and agn bolometric luminosity",
    ".    motivated by these considerations , we present here the results of a systematic study of the velocity shift of [ oiii]@xmath0 emission line , its connection to the baldwin effect , and connection to possible physical drivers .",
    "this study takes advantage of the unprecedented spectroscopic data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) . throughout this paper",

    "type  1 agns are chosen from the sample of seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars of dong et al .",
    "( 2011 ) taken from the fourth data release ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 ) of the sdss .",
    "we select type  1 agns having the [ oiii]@xmath0 emission line in the sdss bandpass and with continuum and emission lines suffering only minimally from contamination by host galaxy starlight . to ensure reliable analysis of the [ oiii]@xmath0 profile , we also require high spectral quality in the [ oiii]@xmath0 region .",
    "our primary goal is to study the connection between velocity shifts and ews . to ensure the reliable analysis of the velocity shift of [ oiii ] , we first construct a basic sample by taking the [ sii]@xmath17 doublet lines as the fiducial reference for the systematic redshift .",
    "[ sii ]  is free from broad line contamination so using it is more accurate than using narrow h@xmath8  ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "the final criteria used for the basic sample are therefore : ( a ) @xmath18 , to ensure that [ sii ]  emission lines , as well as [ oiii]@xmath0 and broad h@xmath8 , are in the bandpass ; ( b ) a median signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath19 per pixel for the optical spectra , and particularly @xmath20 in the [ oiii ]  region ( 49955020  ) ; ( c ) the s / n of either [ sii ]  @xmath21 or @xmath22 line @xmath23 to ensure [ sii ]  to be a reliable reference for velocity shift ; and ( d ) weak stellar absorption features , such that the rest - frame ews of cak ( 3934  ) , cah  +  h@xmath24 ( 3970  ) , and h@xmath25 ( 4102  ) absorption features are undetected at @xmath26 significance . the last criterion ensures the measurement of the agn luminosity and the emission - line ews suffering little from the contamination of the host galaxy starlight ( see the appendix of dong et al .",
    "2011 ) .    after removing duplications and sources with too many bad pixels in the h@xmath8  + [ oiii ]  region",
    ", we obtain 565 type  1 agns .",
    "radio jets may enhance [ oiii ]  emission ( labiano 2008 ) and thus possibly affect the results .",

    "our basic sample consist of 383 sources .",
    "because of the redshift cutoff of @xmath18 ( to ensure the presence of [ sii ]  as the redshift reference ) , the dynamic ranges of agn parameters is somewhat restricted ( see subsection 3.2 ) .",
    "so in the investigation concerning [ oiii ]  ews only , we further define an extended sample by relaxing both the redshift cutoff and the s / n requirement for [ sii ] .",
    "the extended sample comprises 1951 radio - quiet type  1 agns at @xmath27 culled from the dong et al .",

    "( 2008 ) , we fit simultaneously the agn featureless continuum , the feii  multiplets , and other emission lines using a code based on the mpfit package ( markwardt 2009 ) , and if necessary we refine the emission - line fitting with the continuum subtracted spectra using a code described in detailed in dong et al .",
    "the agn continua are modeled by local power - laws for 42005600   and the h@xmath29  regions .",
    "the feii  emission is modeled with two separate sets of templates in analytical forms , one for the broad - line system and the other for the narrow - line system , using the identification and measurement of feii  lines in i  zw  1 from vron - cetty et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , as listed in their tables  a1 and a2 . within each system",
    ", we assume that the respective sets of feii  lines have no relative velocity shifts and have the same relative strengths as those in i  zw  1 .",
    "broad feii  lines are assumed to have the same profile as broad h@xmath8 , while each narrow feii  line is modeled with a gaussian . during the fitting , the normalization and redshift of every system",
    "are set to be free parameters .",
    "broad hydrogen balmer lines are fitted with as many gaussians as is statistically justified .",
    "all narrow emission lines are fitted with a single gaussian , except for the [ oiii]@xmath30 doublet lines .",
    "each line of the doublet is modeled with two gaussians , one accounting for the line core and the other for a possible blue wing , as seen in many objects .",
    "the gaussian that has a smaller velocity shift relative to [ sii ] , whether blueward or redward , is taken to be the core component .",
    "it also turns out to be narrower than the other gaussian component ( if the other one was present ) .",
    "the velocity shifts of the core component with respect to [ sii]in the basic sample have a mean of @xmath3147 @xmath10  ( negative values denoting blueshifts ) and a standard deviation of 72 @xmath10 , while the mean shift of the wing component is @xmath31225 @xmath10  with a standard deviation of 240 @xmath10 , respectively . on average",
    "the core components comprise 54 per cent of the total emission , with a standard deviation of 0.16  dex .",
    "we list in table  1 the fluxes , ews and velocity shifts of the core and wing components and the whole profile of [ oiii]@xmath0 for all the objects in the basic sample .",
    "the velocity shifts are calculated by assuming that the [ sii ]  doublet lines are located at the systematic redshift . in table  2 we list the fluxes and ews of the core and wing components of [ oiii]@xmath0 for all the objects at higher redshifts that are thus not in the basic sample but in the extended sample .",
    "the other spectral parameters of this sample are given in dong et al .",
    "an example is illustrated in fig .  1 of fitting the [ oiii]@xmath0 line profile of sdss spectrum of j080131.58 + 354436.4 ( i.e. , the decomposition of the core and wing components ) .    in the basic sample the velocity shifts of narrow h@xmath8with respect to [ sii ]",
    "have a mean of @xmath32 @xmath10and a standard deviation of 82 @xmath10 .",
    "such a scatter is a bit larger than that of the core component of [ oiii ] .",
    "so if we use narrow h@xmath8  as the fiducial reference for the systematic redshift to study the velocity shift of [ oiii ] , it would smear the correlations of interest in this study .",
    "this should be especially true for the sources at relatively higher redshifts in the extended sample .",
    "those sources have lower spectral s / n and a weaker narrow h@xmath8  component than the sources in the basic sample , thus the deblending of narrow h@xmath8  from the broad component has a larger uncertainty .",
    "the use of narrow h@xmath8  is checked in section 3 .",
    "we notice that there is usually a prominent feii  emission feature immediately redward of [ oiii]@xmath0 , which is dominated by feii42 @xmath33 and [ feii]20f @xmath34 . to ensure that the [ oiii ]  measurements suffer little from poor subtraction of this feii  feature , we visually inspect the fits for the entire extended sample and fine - tune the fits for some objects by carefully matching the model to this local feature . in such objects ,",
    "the relative strengths of feii  lines are significantly different from those of i  zw  1 on which the feii  template data are based .",
    "we explore the connection between the velocity shift and strength of [ oiii]@xmath35 in the basic sample .",
    "we calculate the velocity shifts of the core and wing components and the centroid ( i.e. , intensity - weighted average ) of the whole profile ( @xmath36(core ) , @xmath36(wing ) , and @xmath36(centroid ) , respectively ) with respect to [ sii ] .",
    "the line strength is characterized by the rest - frame ew , as measured by dividing the emission line flux by the underlying agn continuum flux density at the central wavelength , for the core and wing components and the whole [ oiii ]  emission , respectively .",
    "we perform bivariate spearman rank correlations to test the relationship between these kinds of velocity shifts and ews .",
    "this method tests for not only a linear relation but a monotonic one .",
    "the results are summarized in table  3 , where we report the spearman coefficient ( @xmath37 ) and the probability ( @xmath38 ) that a correlation is not present .",
    "a striking regularity emerges from the correlation matrix that _ the velocity shifts of the core and wing components and the whole profile , correlate significantly with the ew of the whole [ oiii ]  emission ( @xmath39 ) and particularly with that of the core component , ew(core ) ( @xmath40 ) . _",
    "the strongest correlation is between ew(core ) and @xmath36(centroid ) , the velocity shift of the whole profile ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "for any a specific kind of velocity shift , the correlation is most significant with ew(core ) , yet not very significant ( or not significant at all ) with the ew(wing ) ( see table  3 ) . for the ews of both the core component and the whole emission ,",
    "the correlation is more significant with @xmath36(centroid ) rather than with @xmath36(wing ) or @xmath36(core ) , yet their correlations with @xmath36(core ) are still very significant ( @xmath43 ) .    in fig .",
    "2 , we show the relationships between the ew of the core component and the velocity shifts of core component and the whole profile . note that our @xmath36(core ) is effectively the same as the velocity shift measured from the peak of the whole [ oiii ]  profile ( @xmath36(peak ) ) , because by fitting the core component one is always getting the peak of the whole [ oiii ]  profile as the central wavelength of the 1-gaussian model .",
    "@xmath36(peak ) is commonly used in the definition of `` blue outliers '' in the literature ( e.g. , zomanov et al .",
    "2002 , boroson 2005 , komossa et al .",

    "@xmath44 @xmath10 , @xmath45(core ) @xmath46 @xmath10 , and @xmath36(core ) @xmath47 @xmath10 .",
    "we then construct a composite spectrum for each subsample .",
    "we first subtract broad h@xmath8  and feii  emission from the sdss spectra , normalize every spectrum by the average flux density in the continuum window around 4200   , and then construct the composite in the same manner as richards et al .",

    "the composite spectra are demonstrated in fig .",
    "3 ( panel a ) .    the variations in ews and velocity shifts among the composite spectra",
    "can readily be seen to be consistent with our correlation analysis in the sense that _ the more the peak of the line is blueshifted , the more the ews of the total emission and , particularly , the core component , decrease dramatically , while the blue wing changes much less_. this is similar to the case of civ  as richards et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found ( see also richards et al .",
    "2010 , wang et al .",
    "in addition , there seems to be a trend of a positive connection between the blueshift of the peak and the strength of the wing component , which is not very significant according to the above correlation result between @xmath36(core ) and ew(wing ) yet ( @xmath48% ) .",
    "it is interesting to explore whether the blueshifting / baldwin effect of [ oiii]@xmath0 are driven by some fundamental physical parameter .",
    "we have therefore investigated the correlations of the velocity shifts and ews of the core and wing components and of the total [ oiii ]  emission with broad h@xmath8  fwhm , continuum luminosity @xmath49@xmath50   ) , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , for the sources in the basic sample .",
    "we calculate the black hole masses based on the fwhm of broad h@xmath8  using the formalism presented in wang et al .",

    "1994 ; kaspi et al .",

    "there is also a positive correlation of the blueshifting with the eddington ratio , but none of these correlations are strong ( @xmath53 ) . in particular , _ no correlation of any ew or velocity shift with these physical agn parameters is more significant ( stronger ) than the @xmath36(centroid)ew(core ) relationship for the same sample .",
    "_    we also divide the 383 sources into three subsamples by @xmath1 and three subsamples by @xmath3 .",
    "we construct composite spectra for each subsample as described in section  3.1 .",

    "we also plot the relatively strong correlations of the velocity shifts of the peak ( i.e. , the core ) and centroid of [ oiii]@xmath35 with eddington ratio ( fig .",
    "4 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the results worthy of note in the correlation matrix are as follows :    * the most significant correlation in the ew - related correlation matrix is the positive one between the intensity ratio of the wing to the core component and the continuum luminosity ( @xmath60 for the 383 sources ) , which hints a positive correlation  albeit a weak one to be sure  between the ew of the wing component and the continuum luminosity .",
    "this is confirmed by our analysis using the extended sample free from the redshift cutoff required by the presence of [ sii ]  ( see below ) , which gives a significant correlation between ew(wing ) and @xmath1 with @xmath61 .",
    "the significance is high because of the large number of sources ( 1951 ) but is still not strong ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the correlation of the ew of the core component with luminosity is slightly weaker than that with eddington ratio in the basic sample ( and much weaker in the extended sample  see below ) .",
    "both are much more significant than those with broad - line fwhm or black hole mass . *",
    "the most significant correlations of all the velocity shifts of the core and wing components and of the total profile are with @xmath3  ( @xmath63 ) , rather than with broad - line fwhm , @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "these correlations are in the sense that the higher the @xmath3 the more the line is blueshifted .",
    "moreover , all the three kinds of velocity shifts have _ no _ significant correlation with @xmath2  at all ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "furthermore , all the objects with large blueshifts have a high eddington ratio , but the reverse is not true ( see fig .  4 ; also komossa et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the dynamic ranges of @xmath1 , @xmath2  and @xmath3  in the basic sample are 2 , 1.5 and 1.5  dex respectively , which are not very large .",
    "it is thus possible that some weak but real correlations are obscured by the significant measurement errors ( see section  4.1 below ; also wang et al .",
    "2009 , dong et al . 2011 ) . to check the correlations concerning ews that do not require [ sii]as the reference for systematic redshift",

    "the results are also summarized in table  4 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the main conclusions remains almost unchanged with similar correlation strengths , except for the ew of the wing component .",
    "as above mentioned , ew(wing ) now has a very significant ( yet still not strong ) correlation with @xmath1 .",
    "it has a less significant correlation with @xmath2 , and almost no correlation with @xmath3  still .",
    "another notable change is that the significance of the correlation of ew(core ) with @xmath3  now becomes much greater than that with @xmath1 , although the correlation is still not tight .    to check for possible effects of the formalism we use to estimated the black hole masses , we re -",

    "all the tests give similar results to those listed in table  4 ( see also table  3 of dong et al .",
    "this is mainly because the dynamic range of @xmath2  covered by our samples is not very large ( @xmath66 dex for the extended sample , centered at @xmath67 @xmath68 ) , and in this range the various formalisms for calculating the black hole masses have only subtle differences from one another ( wang et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "furthermore , we consider possible effect that our sample selection and spectra analysis may bring . in section 2.1",
    ", we simply use the limiting radio flux of first to minimize the effect of possible agn jets .",
    "it is possible that many of the excluded radio sources are not radio loud but just nearby and bright . to check for this",
    ", we perform the correlation tests using the 565 sources before the radio exclusion .",
    "it turns out that , the inclusion of the radio sources only increases the correlation coefficients by a few per cent ( rarely by 10 per cent ) . particularly , all the correlations we concern in this paper , such as the blueshift ",
    "ew(core ) relationship , stay nearly unchanged .",
    "this is mainly because the radio sources account for only 30 per cent of the 565 sources .",
    "we check the effect of using narrow h@xmath8  as the fiducial reference for the systematic redshift . when it is applied to the basic sample ,",
    "the strengths of the correlations concerning [ oiii ]  velocity shifts as listed in tables  3 and 4 are all reduced significantly but the relative strengths among the correlations keep almost unchanged . when it is applied to the extended sample ,",
    "the existing correlations get more statistically significant due to the larger sample size , yet the strengths ( @xmath37 ) get weaker ; e.g. , @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) for the correlation of @xmath36(centroid ) with ew(core ) , and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) for its correlation with @xmath3 .",
    "again , the relative strengths among the correlations keep almost unchanged .",
    "it is , obviously , rather artificial to decompose the [ oiii ]  profile into `` core '' and `` wing '' components by using simply two gaussians .",
    "there is , for example , no theoretical justification that the wing component should have a gaussian profile . and , decomposing the line profile into different components certainly depends on the line width at the sdss spectral resolution . for objects with small line widths and small velocity shifts ,",
    "the decomposition would be more difficult .",
    "we do several investigations to check possible decomposition effects .",
    "we find that the width of the decomposed core component , which is the most sensitive one to the spectral resolution , has only weak ( @xmath73 ) correlations with ew(wing ) , ew(total ) , and the velocity shifts of the core and wing components and of the total emission , and no correlation ( @xmath74% ) with ew(core ) at all .",
    "the width of the decomposed wing component has no strong correlations with the ews or velocity shifts of the core component and of the total emission too , and almost no correlations with either the ew or velocity shift ( @xmath75% ) of the wing component .",
    "these mean that the decomposition process would not bring a serious systematic effect into our results .",
    "despite the crude nature of the decomposition , the primary results about the velocity shifts and the ews of [ oiii]@xmath0 ( and its core and wing components ) appear quite robust , according to both the correlation analysis and the composite spectrum analysis .",
    "our main result is that , while there is a fairly strong correlation between the ew of the core component and the velocity shifts , there are no similarly strong correlations of the ews or velocity shifts of either the cores , wings , or of the whole emission with black hole mass , eddington ratio , or agn luminosity .",
    "thus a tentative conclusion is that neither the large object - to - object variation of the ew of [ oiii]@xmath35 nor its blueshift are readily attributable to some fundamental agn parameters such as @xmath1 , @xmath2  and @xmath3(see also baskin & laor 2005b ) . likewise , neither does the velocity shift ",
    "ew relationship seem to be primarily driven by some agn parameter .",
    "the weakness of the correlations of [ oiii ]  properties with fundamental agn parameters ( including nuclear luminosity , @xmath2  and @xmath3 ) have also been reported in the literature by using samples with much larger dynamic ranges ( e.g. , dietrich et al .",

    "2004 ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the results for the ews of broad mgii@xmath76 doublet emission lines and of narrow optical feii  emission lines , and the intensity ratios of ultraviolet and optical feii  to mgii , as recently discovered by dong et al .",

    "they found that those ews and intensity ratios correlate with @xmath3  strongly ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ; see the above references ) , by using the same data set as the present study .",
    "considering the effects of measurement errors are similar on the correlations of both those lines and [ oiii ] , we believe that the correlations of [ oiii ]  properties with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3are intrinsically weak . for those emission lines arising from the blr and inner nlr ( narrow feii  lines , dong et al .",
    "2010 ) , dong et al .",
    "( 2009a , 2009b , 2011 ) proposed that the essential physical mechanism is that eddington ratio regulates the global properties ( particularly , the distribution of column density ) of the clouds gravitationally bound in the line - emitting regions .",
    "it appears now that the mechanism operating in the blr and the inner nlr does not play a major role in the canonical nlr located far out in the host galaxies and free from the gravitational influence of the central supermassive black holes .",
    "a useful positive inference is that , at least in a statistical sense , the above - mentioned use of [ oiii]@xmath0 as the proxy of agn luminosity does not depend seriously on @xmath1 , @xmath2  and @xmath3 . _    on the other hand , although the [ oiii ]  properties do not depend as strongly on @xmath1 , @xmath2  or @xmath3  as the above - mentioned emission lines arising from the inner nlr and the blr , there are still some significant ( albeit not strong ) correlations between [ oiii ]  properties and those fundamental agn parameters .",
    "the ew of the core component has the most significant ( anti-)correlation with @xmath3 , a less significant correlation with continuum luminosity , a much lower correlation with the broad - line fwhm , and almost no correlation with @xmath2 . for the wing component of [ oiii ]",
    "the most significant correlation is with continuum luminosity . the behavior of the total emission results from the combination of the above two factors , and is mainly dominated by the core component . the magnitude of the blueshifting of the core , the wing , and the whole profile has the most significant correlation with @xmath3 , rather than with the other parameters .",
    "because the sdss spectroscopic survey is magnitude - limited and , moreover , because both @xmath2  and @xmath3are constructed from broad - h@xmath8  fwhm and @xmath1 , there are apparent ( likely not intrinsic ) correlations among these four quantities .",
    "for instance , the spearman correlation coefficients of @xmath3with broad - h@xmath8  fwhm , @xmath1 , and @xmath2  for our basic sample of 383 sources are @xmath37  = @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , respectively . in light of the serious inter - dependence among these four quantities , the correlations of ew(wing ) with broad - h@xmath8  fwhm , @xmath2 , or @xmath3are probably a secondary effect of the stronger ( thus presumably intrinsic ) correlation with @xmath1 , while the correlations of the velocity shifts and ew(core ) with broad - h@xmath8  fwhm , @xmath1 , or @xmath2  are a secondary effect of that with @xmath3 .",
    "this is probable given that there are additional systematic uncertainties plaguing the estimated values of @xmath3 .",
    "one effect is the large uncertainties in virial bh masses , which can be a factor of 4 ( @xmath82 ) statistically , and perhaps as large as an order of magnitude for individual estimates ( vestergaard & peterson 2006 ; wang et al .",
    "another uncertainty comes from the bolometric correction assumed for @xmath1 , which is definitely an oversimplification given the diverse spectral energy distributions of agns ( ho 2008 ; vasudevan & fabian 2009 ; grupe et al .",
    "yet , since the above bivariate correlations of [ oiii ]  properties with @xmath1 , @xmath2  and @xmath3  are not strong , being weaker than the @xmath36(centroid)ew(core ) relationship and much weaker even than the inter - dependence among the agn parameters , we refrain from an over - discussion on this issue at present . the weakness of those correlations either reflects true scatters that are caused by multiple ( and somehow independent ) processes and are thus irreducible , or suggests that there are other dominant variable(s ) yet to be identified ( see the discussions on various possible physical variables / processes in baskin & laor 2005b , risaliti et al . 2011 and caccianiga & severgnini 2011 ) .",
    "the fairly tight anticorrelation between the blueshifts and the ew of the core component appears more notable than the weak correlations with fundamental agn properties .",
    "interestingly , as analyzed in subsection 3.1 , this pattern is just like the situation for the broad civ@xmath7 emission line ( richards et al .",
    "2002 , bachev et al .",
    "2004 , richards et al .",
    "2010 ) , which has already been noted by some researchers ( e.g. , zamanov et al .",
    "this suggests that both the blueshifting phenomenon and the classical baldwin effect are tightly linked ( corbin 1991 , 1992 ) .",
    "note that the classical baldwin effect only concerns the core component .",
    "the wing component can even show an inverse baldwin effect  the higher the agn luminosity , the larger the ew of the wing component .",
    "this is similar to the situation of civ@xmath7 ( richards et al .",
    "2010 , wang et al .",
    "2011 ) . in light of the remarkable similarity in the velocity shift ",
    "ew connection between [ oiii ]  and civ , occam s razor would suggest that the mechanism producing the two correlations is the same .",
    "a wind has been proposed as the cause of the civ  blueshifting ( gaskell 1982 ) and the correlations discussed above seem to be consistent with a scenario where the core of [ oiii ]  comes from the canonical extended nlr where the gas motions are dominated by the gravity of the bulge stars while the wing component arises from an outflow .",
    "this has been discussed by many authors ( see zamanov et al .",
    "2002 , baskin & laor 2005a , richards et al .",
    "2010 , and wang et al .",
    "2011 for details ) . in this model",
    "the `` blue outliers '' could just be extremes ; presumably a higher relative accretion rate drives a stronger outflow .",
    "as pointed out in section 4.1 , the large object - to - object variation in the strength of [ oiii ]  emission and the blueshift ",
    "ew(core ) connection are not governed primarily by any fundamental agn parameters such as @xmath1 , @xmath2  and @xmath3 .",
    "it is likely that it is the ism conditions of the host galaxies that mainly determine the diversity of the [ oiii ]  properties in active galaxies ( particularly its strength ; see netzer et al .",
    "in the outflow scenario , it is natural to assume that the ism gives rise to [ oiii ]  emission and decelerates the outflow .",
    "although agn activity determines the launching speed of outflow , the final speed of the outflow depends on the density and density profile of the ism .",
    "meanwhile , the density and the density profile also constrain the amount of [ oiii]-emitting gas and its emissivity . at the same agn activity level",
    ", denser ism will produce more [ oiii ]  emission while decelerate the outflow efficiently , leading to higher ew and lower velocity .",
    "on the other hand , the similar blueshift ",
    "ew relationship in civ  may be linked to the shape of the ionizing continuum ( richards et al .",
    "so it is possible that the above two factors work together to produce the blueshift ",
    "ew(core ) connection .",
    "yet , we should also mention that , while the outflow scenario is attractive , there seem to be problems .",
    "for instance , the outflow explanation for the blueshifting of civ(gaskell 1982 ) clashes head on with the blr kinematics implied by velocity - resolved reverberation mapping .",
    "velocity - resolved kinematics have long favored gravitationally - dominated motions ( gaskell 1988 , koratkar & gaskell 1989 , 1991 ; gaskell 2009b , 2010b ) and apparent cases of outflow are unlikely to be real but are instead probably the result of off - axis variability ( gaskell 2010a ) .",
    "gaskell & goosmann ( 2008 ) have proposed instead that the blueshifting is the result of scattering off material with a slight net inflow .",
    "this naturally explains the correlation of blueshifting with accretion rate .",
    "if the nlr and blr blueshiftings have a similar cause , the blueshifting of [ oiii ]  too might be caused by scattering , as has been proposed by gaskell & goosmann ( 2008 ) .",
    "finally , we note that while all the agns with large blueshifts have a high eddington ratio , the reverse is not true ( see also komossa et al .",
    "2008 ) . again",
    ", this is very similar to the situation for broad civ@xmath12 ( baskin & laor 2005a ) .",
    "here we must stress once again ( see section 4.1 ) that the correlations between velocity shift and any fundamental agn parameter such as nuclear luminosity , black hole mass , and the eddington ratio , are not strong ( see also boroson 2005 , komossa et al .",
    "thus it is not clear if the velocity shift ",
    "ew(core ) connection for [ oiii]@xmath0 can be reduced to the effect of a specific underlying physical process of the agn activity . anyway , whatever the cause(s ) of the blueshifting of high - ionization nlr and blr lines , the correlations discussed here provide further support for an intimate connection between the nlr and the blr .",
