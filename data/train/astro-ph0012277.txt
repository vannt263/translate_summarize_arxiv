    "main - sequence fitting remains one of the principal methods of determining distances , and hence turnoff luminosities and age estimates , for galactic globular clusters . while recent investigations suggest that cluster ages may no longer set stringent constraints on cosmological models ( perlmutter _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ; schmidt _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ; riess _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) , these measurements remain an important probe of the formation and evolution of the milky way .",
    "empirical main - sequence fitting demands calibrators with chemical abundances well matched to the target cluster , and spanning a sufficient range in colour on the unevolved main - sequence to provide a reliable distance modulus estimate .",
    "unfortunately , those conditions are met for scarcely any galactic globulars , even with the addition of milliarcsecond - accuracy astrometric data from the hipparcos satellite ( esa , 1997 ) .",
    "the local space density of the halo is sufficiently low that distance analyses ( reid , 1997 , 1998 ; gratton _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997b ; pont _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ; carretta _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) rest on data for barely two dozen subdwarfs which have both accurate parallax and abundance determinations , and , to the best of present knowledge , are single stars .",
    "the situation is particularly acute for metal poor globular clusters , with abundances [ m / h]@xmath3 .",
    "while several halo stars with extreme abundances have reliable hipparcos parallax measurements , most of those stars have @xmath4 , placing them near the main - sequence turnoff .",
    "evolutionary effects lead to a steepening of the main sequence at those luminosities in globular clusters , and a small mismatch in age , colour or abundance between calibrator and cluster can lead to substantial systematic errors in inferred distance moduli in main - sequence fitting .",
    "of the few lower main - sequence subdwarfs with [ m / h]@xmath5 , the only star widely used as a distance calibrator is bd+66 268 .",
    "unfortunately , that star is a binary of uncertain mass ratio , and hence uncertain true luminosity .",
    "the scarcity of g and k subdwarfs with accurate parallaxes is not surprising .",
    "unevolved subdwarfs have @xmath6 ; the hipparcos sample is complete to a magnitude limit of @xmath7 . adopting @xmath8",
    ", this gives a sampling volume of @xmath9 pc@xmath10 at m@xmath11 .",
    "the space density of subdwarfs at that absolute magnitude is only @xmath12 , or @xmath13 stars pc@xmath14 mag@xmath14 , so we expect only one such halo star ( spanning the full abundance range ) in the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "hd 103095 meets these criteria , with @xmath15 , [ m / h ] = -1.22 and v = 6.42 .",
    "clementini _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) have addressed this issue , the scarcity of reliable subdwarfs calibrators , by undertaking improved abundance determinations of known subdwarfs ; we adopt an alternative strategy , searching for previously unrecognised subdwarfs .",
    "more distant subdwarfs have lower precision parallax measurements , which can lead to systematic biases , such as the lutz - kelker effect , if the relative uncertainties , @xmath16 , exceed @xmath17 .",
    "since hipparcos parallaxes have typical uncertainties , @xmath18 , of 1 to 1.5 milliarcseconds ( mas ) , this effectively limits the survey volume to @xmath19 parsecs .",
    "nonetheless , given the local subdwarf space density estimated above , we might expect 15 to 20 subdwarfs with @xmath6 and @xmath20 to lie within range of hipparcos measurement .",
    "the hipparcos catalogue is far from complete at magnitudes fainter than v=9 , but does include a significant number of proper motion stars , mainly from the lowell survey ( giclas _ et al . _ , 1958 ) .",
    "proper motion surveys are biased toward high velocity stars , and are therefore good hunting grounds for halo subdwarfs . despite extensive work by carney and collaborators",
    "( carney _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 and refs within ) , only a subset of the lowell stars have accurate photometry and/or spectroscopy .",
    "thus , it remains possible that subdwarfs lie unrecognised amongst the fainter stars observed by hipparcos .",
    "besides proper motions and parallaxes , the hipparcos catalogue provides photometric data",
    ". we can therefore place each star on the hr diagram .",
    "since metal - poor stars are known to be subluminous with respect to the disk main sequence at a given colour ( or , more correctly , hotter at a given mass ) , those photometric data offer the possibility of identifying additional subdwarfs .",
    "this paper marks the first phase in such an analysis .",
    "we identify 317 stars with colours consistent with abundances [ m / h]@xmath21 . using both previously published data and our own observations ,",
    "we have collected accurate photometry and spectroscopy for 80% of the sample .",
    "almost all are eliminated as likely subdwarfs , and most of the survivors are well known halo stars .",
    "nonetheless , our observations identify a handful of new calibrators , and provide the first extensive catalogue of ri photometry of confirmed metal - poor subdwarfs .",
    "the primary source of photometry for hipparcos stars is the tycho experiment , which used grids of star mappers to measure stellar fluxes in two passbands approximating the johnson bv system . as discussed in vol .",
    "3 of the hipparcos catalogue , there are systematic differences between tycho photometry and the standard system ( see also bessell , 2000 ) .",
    "the hipparcos catalogue lists bv photometry culled from the literature for many sources , and figures 1a and 1b use the latter measurements to illustrate the colour terms present in both v@xmath1 and b@xmath1 . figure 1c shows that those terms cancel to a large extent for stars bluer than ( b - v)@xmath1 = 0.6 , i.e. for f and g dwarfs @xmath22 at later spectral types , ( b - v)@xmath1 is redder than the johnson ( b - v ) colour .",
    "the hipparcos catalogue also lists ( v - i ) colours , but these are drawn from such a wide variety of sources that , as noted by clementini _",
    "( 1998 ) , the measurements are of little practical benefit for our purposes .",
    "our aim is to identify candidate metal - poor subdwarfs with reliable parallax measurements .",
    "thus , as a first step , we consider only stars in the hipparcos catalogue with parallaxes measured to a formal precision , @xmath16 , better than 15% .",
    "this corresponds to a systematic lutz - kelker correction of @xmath23 magnitudes for a sample with a uniform space distribution ( @xmath24 ) ; in reality , subdwarf samples are likely to have a flatter parallax distribution ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , with correspondingly smaller lutz - kelker corrections",
    ".    candidate metal - poor stars have been selected based on their location in the ( m@xmath0 , ( b - v ) ) colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "figure 2 plots the ( m@xmath0 , ( b - v)@xmath1 ) diagram for hipparcos stars with @xmath27 and @xmath28 mas - a sample dominated by the disk population . superimposed on that diagram are the mean colour - magnitude relations for three globular clusters : the metal - rich cluster , 47 tucanae , [ fe / h ] = -0.7 , at ( m - m)=13.55 ; the intermediate - abundance cluster , m5 , [ fe / h]=-1.11 , at ( m - m)=14.5 ; and the metal - poor cluster , ngc 6397 , [ fe / h]=-1.82 , at ( m - m)=12.14 ( abundances from carretta & gratton , 1997 ; see reid , 1999 , for a summary of the distance modulus determinations=12.15 for ngc 6397 based on main - sequence fitting using strmgren photometry . ] ) .",

    "we have included the ( m@xmath30 , ( r - i ) ) diagram to illustrate the insensitivity to abundance of the location of the main sequence in that plane .",
    "with few strong absorption features in either band , decreasing abundance produces a relatively small change in the differential blanketing .",
    "such is not the case at lower luminosities , where variations in tio bandstrength lead to more substantial offsets between disk and halo ( gizis , 1997 ) .",
    "our main aim in undertaking this program was the identification of previously - unrecognised unevolved extreme subdwarfs .",
    "we have , not unexpectedly , had little success .",
    "table 11 includes nine single stars with metallicities below [ fe / h]=-1.6 , of which only four ( hip 46120 , 99267 , 103269 & 106924 ) are redder than ( b - v)=0.50 .",
    "however , all of those stars save hip 40778 have abundances derived from high - resolution observations , and , crucially , hip 46120 has [ fe / h]@xmath31 .",
    "the last - mentioned star is the only lower main - sequence star with both an accurate parallax and a reliable abundance measurement=-1.75 , rather than -2.07 , as derived by ryan & deliyanis ( 1998 ) .",
    "they comment that , at the adopted metallicity , the star occupies an anomalous position in the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "those anomalies are not present at the lower abundance adopted in our analysis . ] .",
    "it is not our intention to re - examine globular cluster distances in this paper .",
    "nonetheless , figure 16 offers a single comparison , matching the nine extreme subdwarfs discussed above against ngc 6397 in the ( m@xmath0 , ( b - v ) ) plane .",
    "table 12 includes three subdwarfs from carretta _ et al . _",
    "( 2000 ) with [ fe / h]@xmath32 : hip 18915 , 31332 and 79537 .",
    "however , figure 15 shows that hip 31332 lies above the disk main sequence , suggesting either that the star is a binary or that there is an error in either the abundance measurement or the photometry ; moreover , hip 79537 has discordant metallicity estimates , with ryan & deliyannis ( 1998 ) measuring [ fe / h]=-1.38 , rather than -1.64 .",
    "we therefore include only hip 18915 in figure 16 .",
    "figure 15 plots the subdwarf absolute magnitudes derived directly from the hipparcos trigonometric parallax measurements ; in figure 16 , the absolute magnitudes have been corrected for lutz - kelker bias using the n=3 approximation from hanson ( 1979 ) .",
    "the corrections are small : @xmath33 mag . for all stars , and @xmath34 for ( b - v)@xmath35 .",
    "we have also used theoretical models from straniero & chieffi ( 1991 ) to determine the appropriate colour corrections to adjust the lower main - sequence stars to match [ fe / h]=-1.82 , the abundance derived by gratton _",
    "( 1997 ) for ngc 6397 .",
    "the ngc 6397 fiducial sequence , adjusted to a true distance modulus of 12.14 mag . and a reddening of e@xmath36=0.18 mag .",
    ", is simply superimposed on the diagram .",
    "the subdwarf data are not inconsistent with the adopted cluster distance modulus . following the arguments outlined by reid ( 1998 ) ,",
    "the corresponding distance modulus inferred for the large magellanic cloud is ( m - m)@xmath37=18.62 .",
    "we have searched the hipparcos catalogue for previously unrecognised halo subdwarfs which might be added to the current meagre sample of stars suitable for globular cluster main - sequence fitting .",
    "our survey , covering 263 of 317 candidates with ( b - v)@xmath38 and @xmath39 , shows that few such stars remain hidden in the current database . however , in the course of this exercise we have compiled the first catalogue of reliable ubvr@xmath2i@xmath2 photometry of spectroscopically - confirmed halo subdwarfs with accurate trigonometric parallax measurements .",
    "our sample includes a bare handful of extreme subdwarfs , notably hip 46120 , suitable for matching against metal - poor clusters such as m15 , m68 and m92 .",
    "globular cluster main - sequence fitting distance determinations have been undertaken almost exclusively in the ( m@xmath0 , ( b - v ) ) plane .",
    "this concentration reflects necessity rather than choice : the ( m@xmath30 , ( r - i ) ) plane , for example , may offer significant advantages in greater tolerance to abundance uncertainties , but even with the observations contributed in this paper , many key subdwarfs still lack reliable photometry . filling the gaps in tables 11 and 12 should be a high priority .    as has been pointed out elsewhere",
    ", the dominant uncertainty in cluster distance analysis lies with the available photometry , rather than parallax measurements . indeed , at a more general level",
    ", it remains the case that many stars in the hipparcos catalogue , which have astrometric measurements at sub - milliarcsecond precision , have received no attention from ground - based observatories since the completion of the henry draper or bonner durchmusterung catalogues .",
    "we are in the paradoxical situation is knowing their distances with higher accuracy than their apparent magnitudes or spectral types .",
    "this is a matter which should be borne in mind when considering future large - scale astrometric projects .",
