    "_ chandra _ observations of nearby galaxies have detected several non - nuclear x - ray point sources , some of which have isotropic luminosities @xmath8 ergs / s and are called ultra luminous x - ray sources , ulx @xcite .",
    "these results have confirmed and extended the earlier evidence for the existence of such sources by the _ einstein _",
    "survey @xcite and the rosat detection of @xmath9 ulx in nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "systematic studies of the _ chandra _ observations have revealed that ulx exist in galaxies of different morphological types . since , by definition , ulx emit radiation at a rate larger than the eddington luminosity for a ten - solar mass black hole , they are believed to harbor a black hole of mass @xmath10 , where the upper limit is constrained by the fact that a more massive black hole would have settled into the nucleus due to dynamical friction @xcite . if this is true , then the differences and similarities between the spectral properties of such intermediate mass black hole systems ( imbh ) with those of galactic black holes ( gbh ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , are expected to enhance our understanding of black hole systems in general .",
    "alternatively , the ulx sources may be systems emitting at super - eddington luminosities @xcite , or their emission may be beamed from a geometrically thick accretion disk @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that in the latter case , such thick `` funnel '' shaped disks can enhance the observed flux by just a factor of few @xcite . in any case",
    ", the complexities involved in explaining their origin @xcite and the inferred high accretion rates @xcite make these enigmatic sources an important class of x - ray systems , whose dominant radiative mechanism and geometry , needs to be studied and constrained .    the spectra of ulx are expected to be different from gbh and agn , if the black hole is an imbh and/or if their luminosity exceeds the eddington limit .",
    "earlier analysis of asca data revealed that the spectra of some ulx can be described as radiation from a black - body emitting disk with an additional high energy power - law @xcite , which is also the standard radiative model for the high - soft spectral state of galactic black hole systems . the inferred inner disk temperature from these initial analysis , was found to be too high ( @xmath11 kev ) for an accreting imbh @xcite .",
    "however , recent analysis of _ xmm - newton _ data have revealed the presence of a cool accretion disk component ( @xmath12 kev ) in ngc 1313 x-1 , x-2 @xcite and m81 x-9 @xcite which reaffirmed that these systems may indeed harbor an imbh .",
    "the spectra of some other ulx can be represented by a single power - law suggesting a similarity with the low - hard state of gbh , where the disk emission is either absent or weak .",
    "in fact , transitions between the two spectral states , similar to those seen in gbh , have been reported in the ulx ngc 1313 x-1@xcite and two sources in ic342 @xcite .",
    "analysis of _ chandra _ data for a large number of ulx ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revealed that the spectra of most of these sources can be represented by a power - law with a typical photon index , @xmath13 .",
    "this spectral index is similar to those of gbh in the hard state and seyfert 1 agn @xcite .",
    "however , most of these ulx are too faint for any further detailed spectral analysis",
    ".    one of the most intriguing ulx is the brightest x - ray source in the starburst galaxy m82 that is located @xmath14 away from the dynamical center .",
    "the isotropic luminosity of this source , m82 x-1 , can exceed 10@xmath15 ergs s@xmath16 indicating that either it is radiating well above the eddington limit , or it harbors a black hole @xmath17 , even if some moderate beaming ( a factor of few ) is taken into account .",
    "asca observation have shown that this source is highly variable with its luminosity in @xmath18 kev band changing from 4.5@xmath19 10@xmath20 to 1.6 @xmath19 10@xmath15 ergs s@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the presence of a @xmath21  mhz qpo in its x - ray light curve suggests that the source is a compact object and not highly beamed @xcite .",
    "if this qpo is related to the @xmath22 hz qpo observed in galactic sources , it would imply that its black hole mass , @xmath23 .",
    "its high luminosity and relative proximity makes this source an ideal ulx whose spectra can be analyzed in detail .",
    "@xcite have analyzed and fitted a large number of ulx observed by _",
    "chandra _ including m82 x-1 . after correcting for pileup ,",
    "they report that the 1999 _ chandra _ observation of m82 x-1 can be fitted by a power - law with spectral index @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite mention that the _ xmm - newton _ data can be fitted both by a disk black body emission with an unphysically high temperature of @xmath27 kev and a comptonization model , but they do not quantify the parameter values obtained nor discus the physical interpretation of the fits .",
    "recently , @xcite , fitted the same _ xmm - newton _ data with the bulk comptonization model and obtained a power - law index @xmath28 indicating that this source is similar to the soft / high state of black hole binaries . however , as shown in this work , the column density required for such a fit , @xmath29 @xmath26 , is not consistent with some of the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "note , that the _ chandra _ acis data essentially measures the spectrum in the @xmath30 kev , since the effective area of the detector decreases rapidly for energies greater than @xmath31 kev . on the other hand , the _ xmm - newton _ epic data measures the spectrum in the @xmath32 kev range , since below @xmath33 kev the counts have contribution from the diffuse background .",
    "this complementary nature of the two types of observations makes it imperative to take into account both of them in any spectral analysis .",
    "in particular the _ chandra _ observations give a better measure of the neutral column density , while the detailed higher energy shape of the spectrum can be constrained by _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "since the source is known to be variable , in principle , any spectral analysis should be based only on simultaneous observations , which currently do not exist .",
    "however , here we take a pragmatic approach and use the non - simultaneous _ chandra _ observations of the source , to test whether the parameters obtained are consistent with the results of the _ xmm - newton _ analysis .",
    "our motivation is to obtain the simplest physical radiative model for the source , which in turn , will highlight any differences between this ulx and other black hole systems .",
    "m82 was observed five times between september 1999 and june 2002 by _",
    "chandra_. for three of these observations the pileup fraction for m82 x-1 , is @xmath34% and hence no reliable analysis can be undertaken . for",
    "the other two ( whose observation i d numbers and dates are tabulated in table 1 ) the pileup fraction is around @xmath35% , and hence only these two were analyzed .",
    "acis spectra of the source were extracted from circular regions of @xmath36 2  radius .",
    "background spectra were extracted from nearby source free regions .",
    "the analysis was done using the software , * ciao v3.2.1 * and the latest calibration files available till october 2005 were used to create the spectral response .",

    "both the epic instruments pn and mos were operated in prime - full - window mode using the medium filter .",
    "the pn events were processed using the _ xmm - newton _ analysis software ( * sas v6.0 * ) and calibration data base available in august 2004 .",
    "pn events corresponding to patterns 0 - 4 ( single and double ) were used for the spectral analysis .",
    "the pn spectrum was extracted using a circular region of @xmath42 radius centered at the source position and the background spectrum was extracted from a source free ( based on the _ chandra _ image ) circular region .",
    "the events were checked for the pile - up effect which was found not to be significant .",
    "there are two _ chandra _ detected x - ray point sources located less than @xmath43 from m82 x-1 . to check whether these sources effect the analysis",
    ", we also extracted the pn spectrum from a smaller @xmath44 region and performed the same spectral fitting as described in the next section , although the response for such a small extraction radius may not be accurate .",
    "there were no qualitative difference in the results of the spectral analysis .",
    "since the chandra observations are affected by pileup , the effect was taken into account by using the `` jdpileup '' model of the _ chandra _ spectral fitting software _",
    "sherpa_. we fitted chandra data in the energy range 0.5 - 7.0 kev with `` jdpileup '' model convolved with an absorbed powerlaw . the best fit column density @xmath45 , the photon spectral index @xmath46 , pileup fraction , count rate and estimated luminosity are tabulated in table 1 . since the pileup fraction is significant , fitting with a more detailed model than an absorbed power - law is not warranted .",

    "emission from a black body emitting disk , the xspec model `` diskbb '' @xcite , does provide a formal fit ( table 2 ) , but the required maximum temperature of the disk @xmath81 kev is unphysical and would require a large color factor correction @xmath82 for a disk radiating at the eddington limit around a @xmath83 black hole .",
    "hence , a more plausible explanation is that the spectrum is due to comptonization .",
    "we fit the data using the xspec model `` comptt '' @xcite , which describes comptonization of soft photons by a thermal distribution of electrons .",
    "there are two different sets of spectral parameters which can describe the data .",
    "the first set ( second column of table 2 ) , has a high temperature , @xmath84 kev , and low optical depth @xmath6 .",
    "such a spectrum , which is due to unsaturated comptonization of external photons , is similar to the ones observed in other black hole systems and to the spectral fit obtained by @xcite , using the bulk comptonization model for the same data set .",
    "however , the required column density @xmath85 @xmath26 is larger than the that estimated from _",
    "chandra _ observations ( table 1 ) .",
    "the second set of parameters ( third column of table 2 ) , has a low temperature , @xmath4 kev , and high optical depth @xmath86 .",
    "this spectra , which is due to saturated comptonization , gives a lower @xmath2 as compared to the unsaturated case and the required column density ( which has large error estimate ) is similar to the _ chandra _ value .",
    "an iron line emission , which is required for both the fits , turns out to be a narrow one at the expected centroid energy of @xmath87 kev ( for ionized iron ) for the saturated spectrum fit . on the other hand , for the unsaturated spectrum , the required line energy is unphysically small at @xmath88 kev and has a large width of @xmath89 kev .",
    "fixing the centroid energy to @xmath90 kev ( as reported in table 1 ) still requires a large width of @xmath91 kev .",
    "thus , taking into account the smaller @xmath2 value , compatible column density with _ chandra _ observations and the simpler iron line profile , we consider the saturated comptonization spectra as a better fit to the data .",
    "we confirm this result by also fitting the data to the thermal comptonization model described by @xcite , named `` thcomp '' , which takes into account relativistic corrections ( table 2 ) . instead of the optical depth @xmath64 , `` thcomp '' uses the geometry independent low energy spectral index @xmath67 as a parameter .",
    "the optical depth can then be derived from @xmath67 and electron temperature , giving @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) for a slab ( spherical ) geometry .",
    "the spectrum can also be interpreted as emission from a thermal plasma which comptonizies internally produced bremsstrahlung photons , instead of external low energy ones .",
    "such a model , named `` bcomp '' , fits the data equally well .",
    "thus the fitting is not sensitive to the spectral shape of the input seeds photons used in the model",
    ".     unfolded spectrum of m82 x-1 , for the soft photon comptonization model .",
    "the filled circles are _ xmm - newton _ data points which have been rebinned for clarity .",
    "the solid line is the unabsorbed model ( while dashed line is the absorbed model ) spectrum corresponding to the best fit parameters given in table 2 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the compton y - parameter ( @xmath94 ) is a measure of the degree of comptonization that an average photon undergoes . from the spectral fit parameters , @xmath95 , which implies that the comptonization process is nearly saturated",
    "this is evident in figure 1 , which shows the unfolded @xmath96 spectrum for the comptonization model .",
    "the peak of the spectrum is at @xmath1 kev @xmath97 , as expected for saturated comptonization .",
    "this is in contrast to un - saturated comptonization spectra which peak at @xmath98 .",
    "as reported by @xcite an iron line feature is detectable in the spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of m82 x-1 is unusually hard and hence the simplest radiative model which can describe it is saturated thermal comptonization .",
    "this is in contrast , to other black hole systems , where the spectra is generally modeled as un - saturated thermal / non - thermal comptonization .",
    "the spectra of other ulx are steeper with photon index , @xmath99 @xcite similar to those of agn and galactic black hole systems . thus either , m82 x-1 is different from these systems or at least it was in a rare and unique spectral state during the _ xmm - newton observation_.    the spectral fit parameters obtained imply that the geometry of the x - ray producing region for m82 x-1 , is not the same as that of other black hole systems .",
    "the large optical depth @xmath64 @xmath100@xmath101 would prevent the entry of any external soft photons into the thermal plasma .",
    "hence , the standard geometry of an hot inner disk , which comptonizies photons from an outer cold disk @xcite is not applicable to this source .",
    "similarly , soft photons will not be able to enter an optically thick patchy corona or active region @xcite on top of a cold disk .",
    "on the other hand , the soft photons from a cold accretion disk would diffuse out through an optically thick corona if it uniformly covers the disk @xcite .",
    "however , such models are applicable only when the compton amplification factor , @xmath102 .",
    "otherwise the comptonized photons will impinge back on the disk and heat the disk to the corona temperature @xcite . since for saturated comptonization the amplification factor @xmath103 , the uniform corona model is also ruled out .",
    "a possible geometry is that the inner region of an accretion disk is surrounded uniformly by a thermal plasma sphere .",
    "if the sphere is significantly larger than the soft photon producing disk , only a small fraction of the comptonized photons will impinge back on the disk and energy balance can then be maintained .",
    "interestingly , the fitted parameters suggest that the temperature of the accretion disk , which can be identified as the soft photon source temperature , @xmath104 kev , is expected for a disk around a large @xmath83 black hole . however , it is not clear whether such a large sphere would be dynamically stable or even realizable in the presence of a black hole .",
    "another radiative model for the source is that the thermal plasma comptonizies photons that are internally produced by bremsstrahlung . in the standard accretion disk model @xcite",
    ", the disk is assumed to be effectively optical thick to absorption and hence the disk radiates as a black body locally .",
    "however , at high accretion rates , the inner region of the disk may become optically thin to absorption and the standard disk theory is no longer consistent .",
    "this transition occurs roughly when @xmath105 , which corresponds to a transition radius @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath108 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath109 is the accretion rate , @xmath110 , is the accretion rate corresponding to eddington luminosity and @xmath111 is the dimensionless viscosity parameter . for radii @xmath112 ,",
    "the disk cools inefficiently by bremsstrahlung self comptonization ( bsc ) and hence is hotter than a disk described by the standard theory .",
    "in this region , the temperature increases rapidly with decreasing radii . in certain cases ,",
    "especially when the effectively optically thin region is an extended one , the temperature can vary from @xmath113 kev at the transition radius to nearly @xmath114 kev in the inner most radii .",
    "the resultant spectrum , which is a sum of local bsc spectra , can have a power - law form and such a scenario has been put forward as an alternate model to the standard unsaturated comptonization interpretation of the high energy spectra of agn @xcite and x - ray binaries @xcite . since the temperature increases inwards , the high energy photons are preferentially produced in the inner region of the disk as compared to the lower energy ones .",
    "thus the observed time - lag between different energy bands @xcite can be explained as waves traveling from the outer to the inner regions of the disk @xcite . for m82 x-1 ,",
    "the saturated spectrum could arise from such an effectively optically thin region . however , here the temperature variation is more modest , with a maximum of @xmath115 kev , indicating that the region is not an extended one .",
    "detailed spectral prediction from such a model depends on the actual temperature profile , and the present data is not adequate to unambiguously constrain the physical characteristics of the region .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to note that m82 x-1 is probably emitting close to its eddington limit , even if it is a @xmath83 black hole , and at such high accretion rates , the inner region of the standard disk is expected to become effectively optically thin .",
    "the results obtained in this work need to be confirmed by simultaneous _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "it will also be interesting to find out using future _ xmm - newton _ observations , whether the source makes a transition to a state which has a regular steep x - ray spectrum .",
    "such an analysis will also shed light on whether or not the temporal property of the source , especially the observed qpo , depends on its unusual spectrum .",
    "search and analysis of other ulx that have similar hard spectra needs to be undertaken to verify whether m82 x-1 is indeed a unique source ."
