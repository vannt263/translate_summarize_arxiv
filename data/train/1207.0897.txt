    "aluminium - copper ( al - cu ) alloys are one of the most - studied precipitation strengthened alloy systems , in part due to their historic connection to the first precipitation - hardened al alloys ( al - cu - mg ) @xcite . although al - cu alloys are amongst the earliest examples of precipitation - strengthened al systems , alloys derived from these compositions , such as alloy designations 2014 and 2024 , are still used in aerospace applications @xcite .",
    "al - cu alloys derive a significant measure of their strength from the controlled precipitation of the @xmath0phase on the \\{100 } planes of the al matrix .",
    "these precipitates impede dislocation glide , enhancing the resistance to plastic deformation and hence increasing the yield strength .",
    "the al - cu system is also of great practical interest since the precipitation of the @xmath0phase can be manipulated through deformation and by the presence of various solutes , some of which ( such as in , sn and cd ) are potent even at trace levels @xcite .",
    "industrial variants of these alloys have considerably more complex compositions than simple , `` model '' alloys .",
    "compositions are frequently chosen so as to improve mechanical properties through the formation of multiple precipitate phases . in al - cu - mg alloys , for example , laths of s phase ( )",
    "can form in addition to @xmath0plates .",
    "multiple phase precipitation and the presence of additional elements in solution pose severe difficulties in clarifying the effect of any given element on @xmath0precipitation . consequently",
    ", despite research spanning the past half - century , the mechanism(s ) by which solute elements affect the precipitation of the @xmath0phase remain poorly understood .",
    "the precipitate - matrix interface plays an important role in precipitation strengthening .",
    "a well - known example of this involves additions of ag to al - cu - mg alloys , which results in the precipitation of a phase termed @xmath6 rather than @xmath0 .",
    "although the @xmath6 phase shares the same bulk composition as @xmath0 , it forms with \\{111 } habit instead of \\{100 } and displays remarkable coarsening resistance .",
    "drift corrected energy dispersive x - ray analysis @xcite and 3d atom probe studies @xcite have shown that ag and mg both segregate to the @xmath6-al matrix interface .",
    "the @xmath6 phase has a distinctive interface structure , with a bi - layer of ag atoms at the coherent interface with the matrix@xcite .",
    "density functional theory calculations indicated while substitution of either mg or ag alone was energetically unfavourable , a combination of both elements provided a lower - energy interface @xcite .",
    "recent work has shown that compositional changes at the @xmath0-matrix interface occur in other alloys .",
    "silicon was found to segregate to the coherent \\{100 } interfaces of the @xmath0phase in al - cu - si alloys , substituting for cu sites in the precipitate @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that the interface composition and structure of @xmath0 in binary al - cu differs substantially from the bulk structure , with additional cu atoms occupying octahedral interstices in the precipitate @xcite . despite these studies a detailed understanding of precipitate - matrix interfaces has yet to be developed in the majority of al alloys .    aluminium - copper - silver ( al - cu - ag ) alloys are ideal for studying the effect of a third element on the precipitation of the @xmath0phase . unlike many ternary systems ( e.g. al - cu - mg ) the al - rich region of the phase field",
    "contains only binary phases @xcite , eliminating the complexities associated with competing ternary phase precipitation .",
    "the interatomic spacing in pure ag also corresponds very closely to that of pure al , and substantial additions of silver have little effect on the lattice parameter of al @xcite .",
    "solute misfit can therefore be regarded as minimal , and solute - induced strain can be largely neglected .",
    "in addition , the chemical affinity between ag and cu atoms is weak and the strong co - clustering behaviour exhibited by systems such as al - si - mg is not observed .",
    "early studies on al - cu - ag alloys established that for compositions of @xmath71at.%(ag , cu ) both @xmath1 ( ) and @xmath0precipitates were formed @xcite and it been shown that both phases can form on dislocation loops , with @xmath0and @xmath1platelets observed at different regions of the same dislocation loop @xcite .    we have recently shown that there is significant silver segregation around the dislocation loops at the site where @xmath0precipitates nucleate and that the precipitates are later surrounded by an atmosphere of silver @xcite .",
    "this work examines the segregation of ag to @xmath0precipitates in a al - cu - ag alloy with an emphasis on the atomic structure of the al-@xmath0coherent interfaces .",
    "alloys containing al-0.90at.%ag-0.90at.%cu ( al-3.45wt.%ag-2.05wt.%cu ) were cast from high - purity elements in air at 700@xmath8c .",
    "the composition was verified via inductively coupled plasma - mass spectroscopy ( icp - ms ) .",
    "the largest single impurity was fe ( 0.02wt.% ) , with most other impurities ( including mg ) present at @xmath90.005wt.% .",
    "the cast ingots were homogenised ( 525@xmath8c , 168h ) before being hot - rolled ( to 2 mm thickness ) , followed by cold - rolling to 0.5 mm thickness .",
    "further external deformation was avoided from this point onwards .",
    "discs ( 3 mm diameter ) were punched from the sheet , solution - treated ( 525@xmath10c , 0.5h ) in a nitrate / nitrite salt pot and quenched to room temperature in water .",
    "isothermal ageing of these discs was conducted in an oil bath at 200@xmath8 for between 2 and 4h .",
    "tem foils were prepared by manually grinding the aged discs , followed by thinning to perforation by twin jet electropolishing in a nitric acid / methanol solution ( @xmath713v , @xmath11c in 33% @xmath12@xmath1367%@xmath14 v / v ) .",
    "discs were plasma - cleaned prior to examination .",
    "high angle annular dark field ( haadf ) scanning transmission electron microscope ( stem ) images were obtained using a fei titan@xmath15 80 - 300 microscope operating at 300kv , with convergence semi - angle of 15mrad thus resulting in a spatial resolution of @xmath16 1.2  and with an inner collection angle of 40mrad . by default ,",

    "@xmath0precipitates are frequently observed in pairs at opposite ends of a precipitate assembly , as is shown in fig  [ fig - overview2 ] .",
    "both @xmath0precipitates in fig  [ fig - overview2 ] show enhanced contrast on the coherent interfaces with the matrix , which , as will be demonstrated , is due to silver segregation .",
    "edx maps show segregation of silver to residual dislocations at the ends of the precipitate assemblies .",
    "figure  [ theta - edx ] shows haadf - stem images and edx maps of @xmath0and @xmath1precipitates at the end of an assembly . both",
    "precipitates display strong contrast in the haadf image , as expected from the higher atomic contrast of cu and ag compared to al . between both phases",
    "a diffuse line of contrast can be seen ( indicated by an arrow ) .",
    "edx maps based on the ag l peak ( fig  [ edx - theta - ag ] ) show that ag is present at the sites of both @xmath1and @xmath0phases .",
    "ag is also concentrated along the lattice defect between @xmath1precipitates . the edx map based on the cu k peak (",
    "fig  [ edx - theta - cu ] ) shows cu only at the site of the @xmath0precipitate and not at @xmath1or the lattice defect .",
    "similar edx observations of silver segregation to dislocation loops adjacent to @xmath1precipitate assemblies have also been reported recently @xcite .",
    "these silver - enriched residual defects are also present before @xmath0phase precipitation .",

    "[ defect - line ] ) shows stronger atomic contrast in two bands , separated by approximately 1.5 nm .",
    "isothermally ageing samples for 2 - 4h resulted in the precipitation of @xmath0platelets at the dislocation loops .",

    "peaks within the @xmath0precipitate are due to ( 002 ) cu layers as the atomic columns in the intervening al ( 002 ) planes are not well resolved .",
    "profiles @xmath19 and @xmath22 show a strong double - peak just outside the @xmath0phase ( significantly greater in intensity than the cu sites in @xmath0 ) with the intensity decreasing to that of the matrix over 2 - 3 adjacent planes .",
    "the strong contrast in the interface layers relative to cu sites in the @xmath0phase ( comparable in intensity to that of the @xmath1precipitate ) in combination with the ag detected by edx ( fig  [ edx - theta - ag ] ) lead to the conclusion that these layers were dominated by silver ( z=47 _ vs. _",
    "z=29 for cu ) .",
    "the layer spacing up to and including the ag - containing bi - layer does not diverge measurably from the ( 200 ) planar spacing in the matrix .",
    "all @xmath0precipitates observed in this alloy possess similar ag - enriched coherent interfaces , although in some cases the ag bi - layer was incomplete ( e.g. fig  [ fig - theta - stem-2 ] ) .",
    "the upper face of the @xmath0precipitate has a uniform coverage of two strongly - contrasting atomic layers similar to that in figure  [ fig - theta - stem-1 ] . on the bottom face",
    "this bi - layer gradually diminishes in intensity from right to left , with no clear variation in the spacing of the atomic columns . the haadf image ( fig  [ fig - theta - stem-2 ] ) and intensity profile ( fig  [ fig - theta - profile-2 ] ) clearly show the reduction in intensity in the ag rich layer from left ( @xmath19@xmath20 ) to right ( @xmath24@xmath25 ) .",
    "the atomic positions of the ag and cu containing layers have been verified by imaging along a second direction .",
    "figure  [ fig - theta - stem-3 ] shows a @xmath0precipitate along the [ 001 ] zone axis , with strong contrast evident in two atomic layers on both faces of the precipitate , although the upper interface is brighter than the lower .",
    "fig  [ fig - theta - stem-4 ] presents a example in which the ag - rich bi - layer is absent on the upper interface and present on the lower interface , similar to fig  [ fig - theta - stem-2 ] . in this image",
    "additional columns of cu atoms can be seen on the outermost layer of the @xmath0phase ( labeled `` cu(b ) '' ) , which are of comparable intensity to columns in the bulk @xmath0structure ( `` cu(a ) '' ) .",
    "haadf - stem intensity profiles drawn through the @xmath0precipitates are shown in fig  [ fig - theta - profile-3 ] and  [ fig - theta - profile-4 ] . in fig  [ fig - theta - profile-3 ]",
    "the contrast of the lower matrix-@xmath0interface is weaker than that of the upper interface .",
    "the partial ag layers in fig  [ fig - theta - stem-2 ] and [ fig - theta - stem-4 ] allow the cu - enriched outer layers of the @xmath0precipitate to be seen clearly . when viewed along the [ 011 ] direction , ( fig  [ fig - theta - stem-2 ] ) the outermost cu layers of the @xmath0precipitate ( labeled `` cu(b ) '' ) have stronger contrast than cu sites in the bulk structure ( `` cu(a ) '' ) .",
    "this is evident in plots of the haadf intensity across the precipitate ( fig  [ fig - theta - profile-2 ] ) . where the ag layer is absent ( @xmath24@xmath26 in fig  [ fig - theta - stem-2 ] )",
    "there is a single sharp peak corresponding to the cu - enriched layer ( labeled `` cu(b ) '' ) .",
    "the intensity of this peak is between that of the ag enriched bi - layer and standard cu planes of the precipitate and there is no indication of a shift in the peak position , regardless of whether ag is present . when imaged along the [ 001 ] zone axis ( fig  [ fig - theta - stem-2 ] )",
    "the intensity of the interface sites is consistent with the bulk sites , but , additional atomic columns ( `` cu(b ) '' ) appear between the regular ( `` cu(a ) '' ) sites",
    ". plots of haadf - stem intensity ( fig .",
    "[ fig - theta - profile-4 ] ) show a sharp single peak due to the additional cu at the interface .",
    "these observations are consistent with a model for the introduction of additional cu atoms at octahedral sites in @xmath0at the al-@xmath0coherent interfaces @xcite .",
    "detailed examination reveals that similar additional cu atomic columns are present on the opposite , ag - rich interfaces in fig  [ fig - theta - stem-2 ] and [ fig - theta - stem-4 ] and are also present in figures  [ fig - theta - stem-1 ] and [ fig - theta - stem-3 ] .",
    "a proposed structure for the coherent interface is illustrated in figure  [ fig - ledge - model ] .",
    "atomic layers are numbered for convenience , commencing from the outermost cu - rich layer of the @xmath0precipitate .",
    "cu layers labeled cu(a ) ( layers -2 , -4 , -6  ) have the bulk structure .",
    "those labeled cu(b ) ( layer 0 ) have additional cu in the octahedral interstices @xcite which is responsible for stronger contrast along the [ 011 ] axis ( fig  [ fig - theta - stem ] ) and the appearance of additional atomic columns along the [ 001 ] axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig - theta - profile ] ) .",
    "two layers outside the precipitate ( labeled + 2 and + 3 ) are heavily enriched in silver , with the position of the atomic columns showing no measurable deviation from the position of the matrix atom columns along both [ 011 ] and [ 001 ] zone axis .",
    "although the location of these sites did not change , the haadf - stem intensity varies between @xmath0precipitates and between opposite faces and different regions of the same precipitate , suggesting a broad range of mixed al - ag occupancy .",
    "atomic sites in the adjacent layer ( + 1 ) are consistent with @xmath27 al in the matrix and al sites in the precipitate , as expected for a coherent @xmath0-al interface .",
    "the atomic contrast in these columns , however , is much stronger , suggesting that this layer ( and the opposite + 4 layer ) were partially occupied by ag , although at a lower concentration than the + 2 and + 3 layer .",
    "cu occupancy of these sites is deemed unlikely given ( a ) the stronger atomic contrast , ( b ) the shorter cu - al bond length compared to al - ag or al - al and ( c ) the unfavourable cu - ag bond enthalpy , and ( d ) recently published edx maps showing no detectable cu surrounding the precipitate @xcite .      the semi - coherent @xmath0-al interfaces are frequently enriched in silver . of a total of 40 instances in which the semi - coherent interface are clearly resolved , in 16 cases ( 40% ) ,",
    "the interfaces are completely covered by a double layer of silver . in the remainder of",
    "the precipitates the ag - rich bi - layer is either absent or incomplete .",
    "figure  [ fig - semi - coherent ] shows representative examples of semi - coherent edges of @xmath0precipitates with ag bi - layers along ( a ) [ 011 ] and ( b ) [ 001 ] zone axes . in fig .  [ fig - semi - coherent-1 ] the precipitate directly impinges on a @xmath1precipitate .",
    "the semi - coherent interface is decorated with a bi - layer of ag , similar to that present on the coherent interfaces .",
    "the edge of the @xmath0precipitate is jagged , with the adhering ag bi - layer having facets that alternate between @xmath28 and @xmath29 planes .",
    "it is notable that these are preferred habit planes for the @xmath1 ( ) phase , having the lowest interfacial energy @xcite .",
    "the semi - coherent interfaces are less well resolved along the [ 001 ] zone , ( fig .",
    "[ fig - semi - coherent-2 ] ) ; however , the ag layer can still be seen to be two atomic layers in thickness .",
    "precipitation of the @xmath0phase in al-0.90at.%cu-0.90at.%ag alloys is observed on pre - existing assemblies of @xmath1precipitates .",
    "precipitation in the form of extended arrays or on dislocations is not observed in this alloy , indicating either that the dislocation loops offer a more favourable nucleation site , or that the extended array morphology is prevented from forming .",
    "recently reported diffraction contrast images of the @xmath1precipitate assembly obtained before the nucleation of @xmath0precipitates show diffuse , linear contrast features lying along @xmath30 $ ] directions at either end of the assemblies @xcite .",
    "these have been shown to be segments of dislocation loops tangential to the ( 100 ) planes and dark - field imaging was used to show that the dislocation loop segment had dissociated @xcite as reported for precipitation of the @xmath0phase colonies on dislocations @xcite to yield a body - centred tetragonal stacking fault between partial dislocations with burgers vectors of type 1/2@xmath31 . here",
    "it is shown using haadf - stem imaging and edx mapping ( fig  [ edx - defect ] ) that ag segregates to these defects , whereas the level of cu was not measurably enhanced .",
    "given that the dislocation is dissociated at this stage , despite the absence of cu , it is evident that ag segregation is responsible for the dislocation splitting .",
    "while there are no reports of ag promoting dissociation of a dislocation in this way it has been established that the stacking fault energy of al close - packed ( 111 ) planes decreases locally for high levels of silver @xcite .",
    "interfacial energy , rather than strain , is the most probable cause for the formation of the ag - rich bi - layers .",
    "the al - al , ag - ag bond lengths are 286.3pm and 288.9pm , respectively , and substitution of ag for al is not expected to relieve volumetric strain associated with the precipitate .",
    "in addition , measurable atomic displacements in atomic planes outside the @xmath0structure are not seen in plots of the peak position ( fig  [ fig - theta - profile-2 ] , [ fig - theta - profile-4 ] ) , suggesting that the @xmath0structure is not disrupted by the presence of the ag bi - layer .    the generation of the ag - rich bi - layer involves the loss of @xmath0-al and @xmath1-al interfaces ( as @xmath1precipitates are removed ) and the formation of a al - ag - al - cu interface .",
    "calculations of the interface energies for the al-@xmath0coherent precipitate - matrix interfaces have provided values ranging from 156mj.m@xmath32 using molecular dynamics @xcite to 190mj.m@xmath32 for some first - principles calculations @xcite .",
    "discrete lattice plane method calculations for coherent @xmath1-al \\{111 } interfaces estimated a much lower energy of 6.5mj.m@xmath32 , with facets on other planes in the range 6.3 - 7.1mj.m@xmath32 @xcite .",
    "wetting of the \\{001 } @xmath0-al coherent interface would therefore reduce the interfacial energy with the matrix by replacing the higher energy @xmath0-al interface with a ag - al interface .",
    ".bond enthalpies ( kj / mol ) for gaseous diatomic species @xcite .",
    "[ tab - enthalpy ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the existence of a single atomic layer between a precipitate and the surrounding ag interface layers was also observed for @xmath6 precipitates in al - cu - mg - ag alloys @xcite . according to density functional theory calculations @xcite , mg occupancy of this layer gave the lowest energy structure ; however ,",
    "it was reported that there was no clear indication of additional mg in or around the precipitates @xcite , which would infer that this layer contains al . in the present alloy ,",
    "mg is a trace - level impurity and this layer undoubtedly consists principally of al , with the stronger atomic contrast ( see fig  [ fig - theta - stem],[fig - theta - profile ] ) suggesting partial ag occupancy .",
    "the presence of al atoms in this layer is probably due to the relative bond enthalpies .",
    "although atomistic calculations such as by density functional theory are required to confirm this view , the following explanation appears plausible . in the absence of this layer",

    "there appears to be no structural or chemical alteration in the @xmath0phase , despite the presence of the ag bi - layer .",
    "the outermost layer of the @xmath0phase even contains additional cu atoms in octahedral sites , as has recently been demonstrated in binary al - cu @xcite .",
    "this points to an interaction in which ag chemically wets the al-@xmath0interface , given sufficient solute supply , lowering the interfacial energy , without substantially affecting the @xmath0phase .",
    "a substantial amount of ag is required to form a interface bi - layer and larger @xmath0precipitates with partial ag coverage are observed ( e.g. figs  [ fig - theta - stem-3 ] and [ fig - theta - stem-4 ] ) , suggesting that the ag supply can become deficient . in an earlier study on al - cu - ag aged for 16@xmath1772h @xcite",
    "the @xmath1assemblies were rarely seen .",
    "the most prominent feature were paired @xmath0precipitates , separated by roughly the same spacing as the width of the @xmath1assemblies with few remaining @xmath1precipitates .",
    "it therefore appears likely that silver is drawn not only from solution and gp zones , but from the neighbouring @xmath1precipitates , leading to the disruption and eventually consumption of the precipitate assembly .",
    "this in itself suggests a strong chemical interaction for the interface ag to be preferred over the @xmath1structure .",
    "some 40% of semi - coherent @xmath0interfaces are completely covered with ag .",
    "the ag bi - layer followed the shape of the precipitate edge closely , with a tendency for faceting along \\{111 } planes .",
    "discrete lattice plane calculations show that the @xmath35 interface had an extremely low chemical interfacial energy of 5 - 7mj.m@xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a silver bi - layer seems to preclude further lengthening of the @xmath0precipitate , since cu solute would have to diffuse through 2 atomic layers of silver , with which it has a weaker bond enthalpy than with al ( 227.1 _ vs. _ 171.5kjmol@xmath34 ) .",
    "it is unclear whether the ag - enriched bi - layer affects the preferred thicknesses @xcite or thickening behaviour of the @xmath0phase .",
    "an investigation into the thickening behaviour of @xmath0precipitates in al - cu - ag is underway .",
    "this study highlights that the details of the precipitate - matrix interface are strongly system dependent and that the matrix or precipitate may undergo compositional and structural changes . in al - cu binary alloys , it is the structure of the @xmath0precipitate that differs from that of the bulk phase , with additional cu atoms present at the interface @xcite .",
    "silicon additions to al - cu alloys also affect the precipitate composition .",
    "atom - probe measurements found a factor of @xmath3611 increase in the si content at the coherent @xmath0-al interface in al-4at.%cu-0.02at.%si alloys , which density functional theory calculations attributed to si substituting for cu in the precipitate @xcite .    in alloys containing",
    "@xmath6 phase precipitates , it is the matrix composition that changes , with the formation of a ag / mg interface bi - layer @xcite .",
    "the ag - enriched bi - layers shown here in al - cu - ag alloys bear striking similarities to the mg / ag bi - layers surrounding @xmath6 phase precipitates . however , there was no evidence of an interface layer on the semi - coherent edges of @xmath6 precipitates ( see , for example fig .  5 and 8 in @xcite ) , whereas such layers is frequently observed on @xmath0precipitates ( e.g. figs  [ fig - theta - stem-1 ] and [ fig - semi - coherent ] )",
    "it should also be noted that density functional theory calculations predict that only a combination of mg and ag stabilises the @xmath6-al interface and that charge transfer from mg may play a role in this effect @xcite . in this study ,",
    "mg was present only as an impurity element at levels of @xmath90.005wt.% ( @xmath160.005at.% , compared to 0.90at.%ag ) and it appears very unlikely that mg plays any role in the bi - layers in al - cu - ag alloys .",
    "the observation of additional cu in the outermost layer of the @xmath0phase shows that this phenomenon is not unique to @xmath0precipitates in binary al - cu and can exist despite the presence of a ag interface bi - layer . in al - cu - ag alloys , therefore , both the matrix and precipitate undergo changes at the interface .",
    "this highlights the complexity of interface interactions and the possibility for compositional or structural deviations in the matrix ( ag bi - layers in al - cu - ag , ag / mg bi - layers in al - cu - mg - ag ) and/or precipitate ( extra cu in @xmath0 in al - cu and al - cu - ag , @xmath6 precipitation in al - cu - mg - ag , si substitution in @xmath0al - cu - si ) .    finally , it should be noted that the appearance of the thin @xmath1precipitates was also of interest .",
