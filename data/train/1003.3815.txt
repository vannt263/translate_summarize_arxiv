    "anomalous microwave emission ( ame ) is the name given to excess microwave emission , observed at frequencies in the range @xmath17  ghz , that is strongly correlated with far infrared ( fir ) dust emission @xcite .",
    "this dust - correlated emission is known to be a significant source of contamination for cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data , that must be separated accurately from the cmb signal @xcite .",
    "although there is still some debate about the physical mechanism that is responsible for the emission , the most favoured explanation is in terms of small , rapidly spinning dust grains @xcite . assuming this is the case , microwave observations of spinning dust represent a new way of studying the properties of interstellar dust grains and its environment within the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "accurate observations , at frequencies in the range @xmath18  ghz , are now required to confirm spinning dust grains as the source of the anomalous emission and to study the spectrum to infer information about the grains and their environs .",
    "one of the best examples of spinning dust emission , comes from observations of the dark cloud ldn1622 @xcite .",
    "ldn1622 is a small ( @xmath19  arcmin ) dark cloud at the low galactic latitude edge of the giant molecular cloud orion b , on the outer edge of barnard s loop @xcite .",
    "the spectrum between 1  ghz and 3000  ghz is well - fitted by a superposition of optically thin free - free emission , thermal dust at a temperature of @xmath20  k and a spinning dust component with a peak at @xmath21  ghz @xcite ; at 30  ghz , and on angular scales @xmath22  arcmin , the spectrum is dominated by spinning dust emission .",
    "furthermore , correlations with iras infra - red maps indicate a better correlation with the emission from very small grains ( vsgs ) , as expected if the origin of the cm emission is spinning dust .",
    "about @xmath23  arcmin to the north - east of ldn1622 lies another dark cloud , ldn1621 , which is more diffuse than ldn1622 and forms a broken ring - like structure .",
    "these two clouds together were termed as _",
    "orion east _ by @xcite and are thought to lie at a distance of @xmath24  pc , although there is some debate about whether it lies much closer to us at @xmath25  pc @xcite .",
    "ldn1622 is a higher density dust cloud in which low mass star formation is beginning , as indicated by the presence of t - tauri stars @xcite but there are no bright ob stars in the vicinity ; the uv radiation is predominately from the orion ob1 association .",
    "by contrast , ldn1621 is a lower density , ring - like cloud , with no obvious pre - main sequence stars within @xcite .",
    "here we present 31  ghz data of the area around ldn1621 and compare it with multi - frequency data , to estimate the contributions of free - free , thermal dust and anomalous dust components .",
    "this is compared with previous observations of the ldn1622 dark cloud to the south - west .",
    "section  [ sec : data_reduction ] describes the observations and data reduction while section  [ sec : discussion ] discusses multi - frequency maps of the ldn1621 region .",
    "section  [ sec : analysis ] gives a quantitative analysis of the contributions from free - free and thermal dust emissions and the possible origin of the 31  ghz excess .",
    "conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the cosmic background imager ( cbi ; @xcite ) is a 13-element close - packed interferometer , that operated at the chajnantor observatory , in the atacama desert ( chile ) , from 1999 - 2008 .",
    "the cbi was designed to image the cmb anisotropies on scales @xmath26  arcmin , in ten 1  ghz bands at @xmath27  ghz . with its high surface brightness sensitivity and calibration stability ,",
    "it has also been used to image galactic objects including diffuse dust clouds , supernova remnants , planetary nebulae and hii regions @xcite . in 2006 - 2007 ,",
    "the cbi was fitted with 1.4  m dishes ( cbi2 ) , to allow optimal sensitivity on the smallest angular scales accessible by cbi ( taylor et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the larger dishes improved the point - source sensitivity and surface brightness sensitivity over angular scales @xmath28  arcmin .",
    "the primary beam is well - modelled by a gaussian with a fwhm@xmath29  arcmin at 31  ghz up to @xmath30fwhm/@xmath31 , the region used in the analysis .    during 2007 and 2008 , cbi2 observed ldn1621 ( j2000 : r.a .",

    ", was observed at the same hour angles to allow removal of local correlated signals such as ground spillover .",
    "the data analysis follows a similar procedure to that used in cmb data analysis ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the amplitudes and phases were calibrated using short observations of tau - a , assuming a flux density of 341  jy at 31  ghz and a spectral index @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . the absolute calibration is known to 0.5 per cent , with these values tied to the brightness temperature of jupiter , assumed to be @xmath36  k @xcite .",
    "all the data were inspected by eye to remove noisy data and baselines / antennas that were not providing adequate calibration .",
    "we assign an overall calibration uncertainty of @xmath37 per cent to account for residual gain variations , ground spillover and pointing errors .",
    "the calibrated visibilities were inverted to form an image , and deconvolved using the clean algorithm @xcite , using the difmap program @xcite .",
    "[ fig : cbi_image ] shows the final cleaned 31  ghz map of the ldn1621 region .",
    "we chose natural weighting of the visibilities to optimize for sensitivity rather than angular resolution .",
    "the clean components were primary - beam corrected assuming a gaussian model with fwhm@xmath38 )  arcmin .",

    "the 31  ghz cbi image ( fig .  [ fig : cbi_image ] ) shows a ring of emission associated with the dark cloud ldn1621 .",
    "the ring , of diameter @xmath43  arcmin , is not complete and is not of uniform brightness .",
    "the ring has a brightness in the range @xmath1  mjy  beam@xmath2 , except for the northern part which is at @xmath44  mjy  beam@xmath2 .",
    "it should be noted that the ring is not completely within the fwhm of the primary beam at 31  ghz , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cbi_image ] .",
    "the northern part of the ring is at @xmath45  arcmin from the pointing centre and is therefore likely to be more affected by primary beam errors and noise .",
    "indeed , the brightest pixel in the image is 16  arcmin from the pointing centre .",
    "we found that too many iterations of the clean algorithm could result in additional flux in pixels outside the primary beam fwhm .",
    "in particular , for the brightest pixel , we found that the peak brightness could be boosted by up to a factor of @xmath46 compared to that presented here .",
    "also , far outside the primary beam , very bright sources could be artificially produced .",
    "for this reason , bright pixels that were significantly outside of the primary beam fwhm were not corrected for the primary beam , to prevent distortion of the image . inside the fwhm of the primary beam ,",
    "such errors are negligible .",
    "we also verified the morphology of the 31  ghz image with an image created using earlier cbi1 data , of just 30 mins on a single night .",
    "although of limited signal - to - noise ratio , the ring of ldn1621 was detected with a similar morphology to the data presented here , and the entire ring fits well within the primary beam fwhm of 45.2  arcmin at 31  ghz .",
    "it is also worth noting that ldn1621 is in fact visible on the edge of the cbi 31  ghz image of ldn1622 presented in @xcite and is seen to have a similar morphology .",
    "[ fig : multifreq_maps ] shows a comparison of the 31  ghz contours ( from fig .",
    "[ fig : cbi_image ] ) with various multi - frequency maps .",
    "the frequencies , angular resolutions and references are given in table  [ tab : datasets ] .",
    "the best ir data for comparison are the iris maps , which are the re - processed iras data at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100@xmath47 m @xcite .",
    "we searched the _",
    "data archive for higher resolution ir data , but irac / mips data of the ldn1622 region only covered up to dec.@xmath48 and therefore did not cover ldn1621 .",
    "a ring of emission , coincident with the ring observed at 31  ghz , is clearly seen in the iris maps at @xmath4 m .",
    "the ir ring of ldn1621 has a similar morphology to the 31  ghz contours .",
    "in particular , the ring is not complete to the west and has enhanced brightness on the north and south sides .",
    "the bright cloud to the south - west of the ring is the dark cloud ldn1622 , and is not detected in these cbi data because of the primary beam attenuation beyond @xmath0  arcmin from the pointing centre .    the low frequency radio data at 1.4 , 2.3 and 5  ghz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multifreq_maps ] ) do not show any evidence of emission associated with ldn1621 .",
    "the relatively high angular resolution ( 45  arcsec ) of the 1.4  ghz data is ideal for identifying extragalactic radio sources in the field that could be confusing the extended galactic emission .",
    "no bright radio sources are detected in the field and no radio sources are coincident with the hot spots seen at 31  ghz down to a level of 2.5  mjy in the nvss maps @xcite .",
    "the majority of extragalactic sources have steeply falling spectra and therefore are unlikely to be detected at 31  ghz . due to the limited @xmath49 coverage of the nvss data , extended emission on scales of a few arcmin and larger",
    "will be resolved out by the interferometric response of the vla , particularly in snap - shot mode .",
    "however , the 4.85  ghz gb6 image , at a resolution of 3.5  arcmin , also shows no evidence of emission in the vicinity at the level of @xmath50  mjy  beam@xmath2 .",
    "the gb6 maps are also affected by spatial filtering on scales @xmath51  arcmin @xcite but remain sensitive to spatial scales comparable to the cbi .",
    "the _ wmap _ 5-yr maps are the only other data available at frequencies close to 31  ghz .",
    "_ wmap _ maps at ka - band ( 33  ghz ) and q - band ( 40.7  ghz ) show enhanced emission on large angular scales , while the ring is barely visible because of the limited angular resolution of the _ wmap _ data ( table  [ tab : datasets ] ) . at w - band ( 93.5  ghz ) , the large scale emission becomes faint and only ldn1622 is detected . in section  [ sec : thermal_dust ] , we use the w - band data to constrain the contribution from thermal dust .",
    "the optical images of the ldn1621 region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multifreq_maps ] ) clearly show extended emission in the vicinity of ldn1621 and ldn1622 .",
    "most of this will be emission from the bright h@xmath52 line , which has been separated in the shassa continuum - subtracted h@xmath52 map .",
    "the h@xmath52 line is a good tracer of warm ionized gas and because of its well - known dependence on the electron density ( @xmath53 ) , it is a good tracer of free - free emission @xcite . there is a strong gradient of large - scale emission , becoming stronger to the south - west .",
    "this is expected since there is a strong uv - radiation field towards the orion ob1 association in this direction .",
    "a large - scale gradient such as this will not be detected by the cbi as it is not sensitive to scales @xmath51  arcmin .",
    "an enhancement of h@xmath52 intensity is visible around ldn1622 while it appears to be absorbing the majority of h@xmath52 photons from ldn1622 , which suggests that ldn1622 is in front of the ionized gas responsible for the h@xmath52 emission .",
    "a similar situation occurs in the ring of ldn1621 but the effect is much less pronounced because the h@xmath52 intensity is less and there is a stronger gradient at the position of ldn1621 .",
    "indeed , some estimates of the distance to ldn1621/1622 put it as close as 120  pc compared to 400  pc for orion b @xcite .",

    "ldn1621 is a region of diffuse emission @xmath43  arcmin to the north of ldn1622 .",
    "observations with the cbi at 31  ghz show a broken ring of emission , that is strongly correlated with fir emission at @xmath4 m , with pearson correlation coefficients in the range @xmath54 .",
    "optical and h@xmath52 data show absorption of a strong background of emission from warm ionized gas in the eastern arm of orion .",
    "this suggests that ldn1621 and ldn1622 are in the foreground of orion ( at a distance of @xmath55  parsec ) , possibly as close as 120  pc @xcite .",
    "no h@xmath52 emission , associated directly with ldn1621 , is seen .",
    "this suggests that ldn1621 itself is not emitting significant free - free emission , although the effects of dust extinction do not allow a strong constraint to be placed .",
    "low frequency radio data also do not show evidence of diffuse emission associated with ldn1621 .",
    "the 31  ghz emission is at @xmath1  mjy  beam@xmath2 while an analysis of the gb6 map at 4.85  ghz provides a strong ( @xmath7 ) upper limit of 7.2  mjy  beam@xmath2 at 31  ghz for free - free emission .",
    "the fir - correlated emission at 31  ghz therefore appears to be mostly due to radiation associated with dust .",
    "iras data alone do not allow a reliable extrapolation of the rayleigh - jeans thermal dust tail to 31  ghz .",
    "_ wmap _ data at 93.5  ghz combined with iras data allowed the flux density to be estimated in an aperture of diameter 30  arcmin at an angular resolution of 13  arcmin .",
    "a single modified blackbody indicates that the thermal dust is @xmath11  per cent of the total 31  ghz flux , corresponding to an excess of @xmath56  jy ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the dust - correlated emission has a coupling coefficient , relative to @xmath15 m , of @xmath16k  ( mjy / sr)@xmath2 , consistent with that observed from ldn1622 .",
    "orion east ( consisting of both ldn1621 and ldn1622 ) appear to be part of the same system of dust clouds , emitting significant anomalous emission at frequencies @xmath21  ghz .",
    "spinning dust is an obvious candidate for the physical mechanism responsible for the bulk of the emission .",
    "high sensitivity data , covering a wide range of frequencies ( @xmath57  ghz ) , is required to study such clouds in more detail .",
    "data from the _ planck _ satellite will be particularly useful in constraining the rayleigh - jeans dust tail , which may be responsible for a significant fraction of the 31  ghz if the emissivity index flattens at longer wavelengths .",
