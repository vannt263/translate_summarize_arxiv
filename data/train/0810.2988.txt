    "virus multiplication is at the basis of viral infection .",
    "although the viral replication cycle involved makes heavy use of the infected cell s resources ( warrilow _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ; fujii _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) , the enzyme(s ) in charge of viral genome replication is(are ) frequently encoded in the latter ( brass _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) .",
    "compared to cellular polymerases , viral polymerases are usually more error - prone ( kashkina _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) .",
    "it follows that the viral mutation rate , defined as the average number of base changes at a given position of the genome per replication cycle , may be large compared to that observed in our own cells , which is about one in a billion ( petravic _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) . for certain viruses , in particular retroviruses like hiv-1",
    ", it could be up to 1,000,000 times greater . by the end of 2007 ,",
    "the los alamos hiv data base listed over 230,000 different viral sequences ( see www.hiv.lanl.gov ) .",
    "given the small genome size of these viruses , chances are then that each member of a viral progeny carries mutations",
    ". a single point mutation may be enough to simultaneously affect two genes encoded in different , but overlapping reading frames , whilst silent mutations , which do not change amino acid coding , may nevertheless have important biological consequences ( mueller _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 )    a virus is mainly characterized by its ability to infect target cells ( infectivity ) and by its antigenic signature ( antigenicity ) , defined as both the capacity to induce an immune response and also its strength and type .",
    "immunogenicity is the ability of antigens to elicit a response from cells of the immune system .",
    "mutations during virus replication may therefore release infective or non - infective viruses , of the same or of different antigenicity . for hiv-1 , the ratio of infectious to non - infectious particles is estimated to range from 1:1 to 1:60,000 , depending on the type of cell infected and the viral strain ( thomas _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) . whether the virus is infective or not , over 800 mutations affecting hiv-1 antigenicity were identified in its envelop gene ( env ) alone ( kothe _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) .",
    "by encoding its own replication enzymes , the virus has control over its replication fidelity and thereby challenges heavily the immune system , due to the huge burden imposed by the number of infective virions produced and their antigenic diversity .",
    "this burden is even worse when the virus targets part of the immune system ( cd4 displaying cells ) , as is the case for hiv-1 .",
    "in addition , the immune cell proliferation induced by the viral attack will provide hiv-1 virions with new targets , engaging the cell - virus dynamics in an exponentially soaring extension regime .",
    "kinetic modeling is therefore of high interest for understanding the course of infection .",
    "it is a prerequisite for designing and optimizing treatment strategies based on antiviral drugs",
    ". a large number of deterministic and stochastic inter- and intra - cellular models of hiv dynamics have already been proposed ( finzi and silliciano , 1998 ; nowak and may , 2000 ; pastore and zubelli , 2008 ; perelson , 2002 ; snedecor , 2003 ; perelson and nelson , 1999 ; tuckwell and le corfec , 1998 ) , but none enable the prediction of the course of the disease in all its phases .",
    "for instance , even if , following antiviral treatment , the plasma load of the virus becomes undetectable , unscheduled bursts occur , probably fed by viral sanctuaries disseminated in various tissues and organs ( lymph or neuronal tissues , gastro - intestinal or uro - genital tracts etc . see recher _ et al . _",
    "( 2007 ) ) .",
    "one may assume that , despite tissue - specific kinetic diversities , the course of infection in all sanctuaries ( including plasma ) obeys a common , complex host - predator relation , differing only by sanctuary - specific parameters .",
    "the course of the global infection would then be the result of all local processes .",
    "this result would however not be a simple addition or superposition , as it is likely that each local process would provid e viruses having locally - specified antigenicities and infectivities which may challenge the immune cells in the same or other sanctuaries .    what is the infection phenomenology ?",
    "as far as our study is concerned , the process involves four major participants or `` fields '' : uninfected t lymphocytes ( denoted @xmath1 ) , infected ones ( @xmath2 ) , infectious viruses ( @xmath3 ) and non - infectious viruses ( @xmath2 ) . for each participant ,",
    "a characteristic antigenicity is recognized by a lymphocyte , or displayed by a virus . in the following , we call antigenicity the variable associated to this biomolecular characteristic and denote it by the index @xmath4 .",
    "the evolution with time of @xmath5 depends on 3 phenomena : regression of the @xmath5 population due to the viral attack ( whatever the antigenic pedigree of the infecting virus ) , which transforms @xmath5 s into @xmath6 s ; the stimulation of the immune system by both infectious and noninfectious viruses of antigenicity @xmath4 ; the natural fate of @xmath5 independently of the viral presence , ie spontaneous generation and death of @xmath5 species .",
    "the @xmath5 population may include cross - reacting species , which are active also against a ( limited ) number of targets with different antigenicities .",
    "@xmath6 lymphocytes are derived only from the @xmath5 population following viral attack , ie the immune system does not directly contribute inactive t cells of antigenicity @xmath4 .",
    "it is assumed also , that the switch from the @xmath5 to the @xmath6 state occurs only upon viral infection . as for @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath6 s are subject to natural death .",
    "viruses @xmath7 and @xmath8 are generated through infection of any susceptible t cell , whatever its antigenicity .",
    "the parent virus of @xmath7 and @xmath8 may be a @xmath7 ( no viral antigenicity modification ) or a @xmath9 of different antigenicity ( viral antigenicity mutation ) .",
    "viruses @xmath7 and @xmath8 will be the target of lymphocytes @xmath5 exclusively .",
    "both viral species have a natural death rate .",
    "viruses @xmath7 and @xmath8 differ by mutations in genes involved in infectivity , but not affecting antigenicity @xmath4 .",
    "this modelling assumes that viral genome parts responsible for infectivity may differ from those responsible for antigenicity .",
    "since the viral strategy is to escape the immune response whilst minimizing loss of infectivity , excess mutations in the antigenicity - specifying part of the viral genome would be more favorable .",
    "the immune system senses mainly the viral surface , hence mutations in the viral envelop genes would be most beneficial , but they should not , or marginally only , affect viral genome parts responsible for infectivity .",
    "hiv-1 handles in part this dilemma by introducing mutational hot - spots in its genome ( ji and loeb , 1994 and the website http://www.hiv.lanl.gov ) , mainly in the envelop genes , where the mutation rate is much higher due to local sequence and structural particularities of the genome ( bebenek _ et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ; kothe _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) .",
    "what is the therapeutic motivation ?    approved drugs for aids treatment are of three kinds mainly .",
    "two of them inhibit reverse transcription ( using nucleotide and non - nucleotide analogs ) and the third inhibits a viral enzyme in charge of cleaving reverse transcriptase from a precursor protein . because of its high mutation rate , hiv rapidly develops resistance to any one of these drugs taken individually .",
    "resistance can be considerably delayed by using various combinations of these drugs ( multitherapies ) .",
    "so far however , no combination has been found that could clear the virus .",
    "therefore therapies are life - long and unfortunately have considerable side - effects .",
    "obviously , the high mutation rate of reverse transcriptase is central to the successful viral strategy .",
    "it allows the virus to escape the circulating immune cells ( antigenic mutations ) and to develop drug resistance , although over 90% of its progeny lacks infectivity and will therefore be rapidly cleared .",
    "the natural viral mutation rate is at the limit of the `` error threshold '' ( biebricher and eigen , 2005 ) , as a slight increase would produce 100% non - infectious viruses .",
    "conversely , reducing the mutation rate would reduce the antigenic diversity and allow the immune system to eliminate the stabilized viral strains , and drug resistance would vanish .    new aids therapy at stake ?",
    "a promising therapeutic approach would then be to take control of the viral mutation rate .",
    "this was shown to be feasible ( derrien , 1998 with a cnrs - filed patent based on this work uspto 6,727,059 ; murakami _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ; harris _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ; drosopoulos _ et al . _ , 1998 ) , by supplying the reverse transcriptase with nucleotide analogs",
    ". some of them relax while others reinforce the replication fidelity , without blocking reverse transcription .",
    "for a review see anderson _",
    ".    both therapeutic strategies would give rise to specific viral dynamics .",
    "these need to be understood and assessed in detail .",
    "the medical decision to choose one particular strategy and setting up the adapted drug regimen for a patient , given his viral load and lymphocyte count ( dose and extent of treatment , time expected to reach viral clearance etc ) needs careful analysis .",
    "simulation of viral dynamics with a drug regimen could help in reaching this decision . to this end",
    ", the present work is to build a realistic mathematical model of viral dynamics .    in the following",
    "we review some well - known models by giving an analysis of the fixed points and their stability in section 2 .",
    "in section 3 , we derive our new model precisely and section 4 is devoted to a full study of its mathematical properties in a reduced case ( only one antigenicity ) .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "throughout this section , we review some well - known models . some of them take specific biological reality into account .",
    "so as to come to a common description with our model presented later , we reduced them in a preliminary step when needed .",
    "the fields @xmath10 have the same meaning as above .",
    "when the model has a term identical to ours , we denote the parameter of the term as ours . when it is different , we denote it the same way as the authors and add a subscript depending on the authors .",
    "also , we use the very same values of common parameters to have comparable results .",
    "we take most values from snedecor ( 2003 ) since this paper is very well documented and check these values with other articles ( nelson _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ; herz _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ; perelson _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ; ... ) .",
    "all the fields of the models are non - dimensionnalized by using the value of the non - infected lymphocytes at health ( no virus and long time ) as a characteristic value both for the lymphocytes ( infected or not ) and the virus .      in nowak and",
    "may ( 2000 ) the authors propose a simple model for the dynamics of the non - infected lymphocytes ( @xmath1 ) , the infected ones ( @xmath2 ) and the viral population ( @xmath3 ) : @xmath11 { \\frac{\\mbox{\\normalsize{${\\rm d}u$}}}{\\mbox{\\normalsize{${\\rm d}t$ } } } } & = &   \\gamma_{nm } \\",

    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] this system is linear except for one interaction term .",
    "a simple analysis of this system gives two fixed points that are either health ( @xmath12 ) or a state that we will call hereafter seropositivity since virus coexist with lymphocytes :    @xmath13    notice , that the link of our denomination with what is usually called `` seropositivity '' would need to be investigated . in our contribution , a seropositivity state is any fixed point different from health .",
    "we also define a seropositivity fixed point to be admissible if the fields ( namely @xmath14 ) are positive . here",
    "it gives @xmath15 and so @xmath16 . we say that such a fixed point is immune deficient .",
    "so according to the parameters , there is either one fixed point ( health ) or two ( health and seropositivity ) .",
    "concerning stability , the study is easy too .",
    "the characteristic polynomial is @xmath17 .",
    "the second order polynomial has a positive discriminant . on the one hand , if @xmath18 ( there exists a seropositivy fixed point as @xmath16 ) then health is unstable in one direction and stable in the two others . on the other hand if @xmath19 , health is the only fixed point and is locally stable .",
    "we perform numerical simulations for which the following parameters were taken : @xmath20    in figure [ nowak - may - sante ] , one may see the dynamics for the case of health alone ( @xmath21 ) , and an initial value close to health ( @xmath22 @xmath23 ) . as is proved by theory , health ( alone )",
    "is stable .",
    "after about one day , the number of viruses is decreasing by one order of magnitude . during this period",
    ", the number of sound lymphocytes is changed only by 1 part over 10,000 .",
    "it begins to rise again after about 8 days .         by changing @xmath24 for @xmath25",
    ", we reach the regime where there are two fixed points . with an initial condition identical to above ( @xmath26 )",
    ", we numerically check that seropositivity is stable as can be seen on figure [ nowak - may - seropo ] .",

    ", the number of healthy lymphocytes decreases to @xmath29 typically then raises to @xmath30 . in the end , the dynamics oscillates around a fixed point that is the seropositive state ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 with our parameters ) .         in nowak and may ( 2000 )",
    ", the authors also proposed some other models taking the antigenicity into account . in chapter 12 of their book",
    ", they propose various models , suggesting that `` antigenic variation generates the long - term dynamics that give rise to the overall pattern of disease progression in hiv infection '' ( p. 124 ) .",
    "their `` general idea was that the rapid genetic variation of the virus generates over time viral populations ( quasispecies ) which are more and more adapted to grow well in the microenvironment of a given patient '' ( p. 124 ) .    according to their best model , ``",

    "the conclusion of their study is that _ in their models _ `` the cross - reactive immune responses provide a selection pressure _ against _ antigenic variation , while strain - specific responses select _ for _ antigenic variation '' ( nowak and may , 2000 ) .      in snedecor ( 2003 ) , the author gives three models of the multiplication of virus hiv-1 .",

    "@xmath148 the first and most complex is multiplication and mutation . through mental experiments , we are to determine the fields present in the modeling term .",
    "as multiplication takes place in the infected lymphocytes , if there were no such lymphocytes ( @xmath198 ) , whatever might be the number of ( free ) viruses , there would be no multiplication and the term would be zero .",
    "this would almost occur in the end of the disease .",
    "more precisely , as once a virus has infected a lymphocyte , no more viruses may infect it ( dern _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) , @xmath2 is a good measure of the total number of infectious viruses .",
    "note that in our model @xmath3 is the number of free and infecting viruses .",
    "so there must be a dependance on @xmath2 ( or @xmath6 at this stage ) .",
    "as the antigenicity of an infected lymphocyte has no link with the antigenicity of the multiplicating virus , the involved field must be @xmath2 ( and not @xmath6 ) .",

    "<S> we take into account the antigenic diversity through what we define `` antigenicity '' whether of the virus or of the adapted lymphocytes by a specific variable . </S>",
    "<S> we model two processes in the interaction of the immune system and the viral strains . </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand , the presence of a given viral quasi - species generates antigenically adapted lymphocytes . on the other hand , the lymphocytes kill viruses for which they have been designed . </S>",
    "<S> we consider also the mutation and multiplication of the virus . a new infection term is derived .    </S>",
    "<S> so as to compare our system of differential equations with some well - knowns models , we study all of them mathematically and compare their predictions to ours in the reduced case of only one antigenicity . in this particular case , our model does not yield any major qualitative differences . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that in this case , our model is biologically consistent ( positive fields ) and has a unique continuous solution for long time evolution . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , this model improves the ability to simulate more advanced phases of the disease .    </S>",
