    "the narrow ( fwhm  @xmath4 ) fluorescent fe  k@xmath0 emission line at @xmath2  kev is a ubiquitous feature in the x - ray spectra of both type  1 and type  2 active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , its centroid energy indicating an origin in cold , neutral matter ( e.g. sulentic et al . 1998 ; yaqoob & padmanabhan 2004 ; levenson et al .",
    "2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "the fe  k@xmath0 line at @xmath2  kev is also an important diagnostic in some x - ray binary systems ( e.g. white et al .",

    "the equivalent width ( ew ) and luminosity of the fe  k@xmath0 line are nontrivial to calculate , except when the total fe  k band ( @xmath5@xmath6  kev ) optical depth of the line to absorption and scattering is @xmath7 . in general , the observed ew and line flux depend , at the very least , on the geometry , column density of the line - emitting matter , covering factor , element abundances , and the orientation of the structure relative to the observer s line of sight . using cosmic abundances from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) and photoelectric cross - section from verner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , it is straightforward to show that the optical depth of the fe  k@xmath0 line to absorption plus compton scattering is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the column density , @xmath10 , in units of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , @xmath12 is already @xmath13 for column densities as low as @xmath14 so that we expect ews and line fluxes calculated using an optically - thin approximation to break down even for column densities lower than @xmath15 . indeed , using detailed monte carlo simulations of a toroidal x - ray reprocessor , murphy & yaqoob ( 2009 ; hereafter my09 ) showed that geometrical and inclination - angle effects begin to become important for @xmath16 .    whilst detailed calculations of the fe  k@xmath0 line ew for various geometries are abundant in the literature ( e.g. leahy & creighton 1993 ; ghisellini et al .",

    "one may be interested in the absolute flux of the fe  k@xmath0 line ( in addition to , or instead of the ew ) .",
    "for example , we may want to know the fraction of the number of photons ( or fraction of the luminosity ) in the continuum above the fe  k photoelectric absorption edge threshold energy that appear in the fe  k@xmath0 emission line .",
    "since the reprocessed , scattered x - ray continuum at any particular energy is a complicated function of the column density , geometry , and system inclination angle , the fe  k@xmath0 emission - line flux can not be trivially calculated from the ew . in some situations",
    ", it may be more appropriate , or easier , to compare and interpret the fe  k@xmath0 line _ flux _ from different models ( as opposed to the ew ) . in the present paper",
    "we calculate the _ efficiency _ of production of the fe  k@xmath0 line , expressed as the ratio of the number of photons in the emission line to the number of photons in the illuminating continuum , above the fe  k edge absorption threshold energy .",
    "we utilize monte carlo results from the toroidal x - ray reprocessor model of murphy & yaqoob , described in detail in my09 , but we also discuss the generalization of our results to other geometries .    the paper is organized as follows . in  [ mytorusmodel ] we give an overview of the details of the monte carlo model . in  [ lineflux ] we present the results for calculations of the efficiency of production of the fe  k@xmath0 line in the context of a toroidal x - ray reprocessor model . in  [ othergeom ]",
    "we discuss the generalization of our results for other geometries and arbitrary covering factors . in  [ application ] we apply our results to the well - known seyfert galaxy mcg  @xmath36 - 30 - 15 .",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions in  [ torusconcl ] .",
    "we have constructed a monte - carlo code to calculate grids of green s functions to model the passage of x - rays through a toroidal reprocessor . the model , and some basic results ,",
    "have been described in detail in my09 . here",
    "we give a brief overview of the critical assumptions that the model is based upon .",
    "our geometry is an azimuthally - symmetric doughnut - like torus with a circular cross - section , characterized by only two parameters , namely the half - opening angle , @xmath17 , and the equatorial column density , @xmath18 ( see my09 for details ) .",
    "the inclination angle between the observer s line of sight and the symmetry axis of the torus is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath19 @xmath20 corresponds to a face - on observing angle and @xmath19 @xmath21 corresponds to an edge - on observing angle ( see my09 for exact definitions of the face - on and edge - on angle bins ) .",
    "we assume that the x - ray source emits isotropically and that the reprocessing material is uniform and essentially neutral ( cold ) . for illumination by an x - ray source that is emitting isotropically , the mean column density , integrated over all incident angles of rays through the torus , is @xmath22  @xmath23@xmath18 .",
    "the column density may also be expressed in terms of the thomson depth : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the column density in units of @xmath26 . here",
    ", we have employed the mean number of electrons per h atom , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "note that this assumes that the abundance of he is 10% by number and that the number of electrons from all other elements aside from h and he is negligible ( i.e. @xmath29 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath17 for which we have calculated a comprehensive set of green s functions is @xmath30 , for @xmath10 in the range @xmath31 , using input energies up to 500  kev see my09 for details . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the solid angle subtended by the torus at the x - ray source , @xmath33 , is @xmath34 ( and we refer to @xmath35 $ ] as a covering factor , which in this case is 0.5 ) .",
    "our model employs a full relativistic treatment of compton scattering , using the full differential and total klein - nishina compton - scattering cross - sections .",
    "we utilized photoelectric absorption cross - sections for 30 elements as described in verner & yakovlev ( 1995 ) and verner et al .",
    "we used anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) elemental cosmic abundances in our calculations .",
    "for the fe  k@xmath0 and fe  k@xmath36 fluorescent emission lines , we used rest - frame line energies of 6.400 and 7.058  kev respectively , appropriate for neutral matter ( e.g. see palmeri et al .",
    "we used a fluorescence yield for fe of 0.347 ( see bambynek et al",
    ". 1972 ) and an fe  k@xmath36 to fe  k@xmath0 branching ratio of 0.135 ( representative of the range of experimental and theoretical values discussed in palmeri et al . 2003 , see also kallman et al .",
    "observational measurements of the equivalent width ( ew ) and/or flux of the fluorescent fe  k@xmath0 emission line in the literature generally refer to the zeroth - order emission only , since the line is typically fitted with a gaussian",
    ". the scattered flux ( i.e. , the compton shoulder ) can carry up to @xmath37 of the zeroth - order flux , depending on the geometry and column density of the matter ( e.g. matt 2002 ; my09 ) .",
    "however , the scattered part of the line , or compton shoulder , is generally not fitted ( usually because it is not detected ) , or , if it is fitted , a separate ew or flux is quoted . on the other hand , part of the compton shoulder",
    "may be blended with the zeroth - order line since most of the flux of the compton shoulder spans an energy range that stretches from the zeroth - order line energy to @xmath38  kev .",
    "the amount of blending depends on the column density , geometry , and orientation of the line emitter , as well as the velocity broadening and instrumental spectral resolution .",
    "however , in the remainder of the paper , the fe  k@xmath0 line flux , intensity , luminosity , or ew , will always refer to the zeroth - order ( unscattered ) part of the emission line .",
    "corrections for the compton shoulder should be made that are appropriate for a particular situation .",
    "we define the efficiency of production of the fe  k@xmath0 emission line , @xmath39 , as the ratio of the line flux , @xmath40 , to the integrated flux in the incident x - ray continuum above the fe  k absorption edge threshold energy , @xmath41 :    @xmath42    here , @xmath41 is the threshold energy for fe  k - shell absorption , and we adopt the verner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) value of @xmath43  kev . assuming a power - law incident continuum , with photon index @xmath44 ,    @xmath45    where @xmath46 refers to the line flux renormalized to an incident continuum that has a monochromatic flux of 1  photon @xmath47 at 1 kev .",
    "the efficiency does not of course depend on the absolute normalization of the continuum .",
    "note that the definition for the efficiency explicitly assumes that the intrinsic x - ray continuum emission is isotropic and emitted into a solid angle of @xmath48 .",
    "however , @xmath46 refers to the _ observed _ line flux so the efficiency may have an inclination - angle dependence . in the definition of @xmath39 we choose to use an upper limit of infinity because we find from our monte carlo simulations that when the medium becomes compton - thick , downscattering of photons with initial energies much higher than even 20  kev to lower energies enables those high - energy photons to make significant contributions to the fe  k@xmath0 line flux .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  1 which shows , for several column densities , the number of fe  k@xmath0 emission - line photons resulting from continuum photons injected into the medium at an energy @xmath49 , as a fraction of the number of line photons resulting from continuum photons injected at 7.2  kev ( just above the fe  k absorption edge ) .",
    "for example , it can be seen that for @xmath50 ( dotted line , fig .  1 )",
    ", the curve breaks at @xmath51  kev , becoming flatter at higher energies . for @xmath52 ( upper solid line , fig .",
    "1 ) the curve breaks and becomes flatter at @xmath53  kev .",
    "an upper limit of infinity on the integral in equation  [ eqn : effgendef ] is also less arbitrary than choosing a specific value . in practice ,",
    "the incident x - ray continuum in agn will steepen and cut off at high energies ( a few hundred kev in agn ",
    "e.g. see dadina 2008 , and references therein ) .",
    "the effect of such a cut - off will give a somewhat larger efficiency than that given by equation  [ eqn : effgendef ] .",
    "however , our purpose is to facilitate the estimation of the absolute fe  k@xmath0 line flux ; corrections required for different incident continua can easily be calculated .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the absorption opacity above the fe  k edge is _ not _ due mostly to fe .",
    "the ratio of the fe  k shell opacity to the sum of all of the other absorption opacities ( for the cross - sections and abundances that we have adopted ) is 0.51 just above the fe  k shell threshold energy , and never exceeds 0.61 .    in the optically - thin limit for which absorption and scattering optical depths in the fe  k band ( @xmath5@xmath6  kev ) are @xmath7 , we can obtain an analytic expression for @xmath39 .",
    "we can adopt the optically - thin expression for the fe  k@xmath0 line ew in my09 and multiply by the continuum at 6.4  kev in this limit .",
    "we get    @xmath54    where    @xmath55    the quantity @xmath35 $ ] is the fractional solid angle that the line - emitting matter subtends at the x - ray source ( and we refer to it synonymously as the covering factor ) . for the my09 torus model , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 ( see  [ mytorusmodel ] ) .",
    "the k - shell fluorescence yield is given by @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the yield for the fe  k@xmath0 line only ( i.e. not including fe  k@xmath36 ) . using our adopted value of 0.135 for the fe  k@xmath36/fe  k@xmath0 branching ratio , @xmath60 .",
    "the quantity @xmath61 is the fe abundance relative to hydrogen ( @xmath62 is the cosmic value in anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath63 is the fe  k shell absorption cross - section at the fe  k edge energy , @xmath41 , and @xmath0 is the power - law index of the cross - section as a function of energy . for the verner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) data that we have adopted , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ( see my09 ) .    using the my09 toroidal x - ray reprocessor monte carlo results for @xmath35=0.5 $ ] and an input power - law continuum with @xmath66 , we constructed curves of the fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency , @xmath39 , versus @xmath18 using equation  [ eqn : effgendef ] .",
    "2 shows two such curves ( solid lines ) , the upper and lower curves corresponding to the face - on and edge - on inclination - angle bins respectively .",
    "it can be seen that both curves show similar behavior . as @xmath18 is increased , @xmath39 first increases but then turns over , reaching a maximum for @xmath18 somewhere between @xmath67 , depending on the inclination angle .",
    "this is because the escape of fe  k@xmath0 line photons from the medium after they are created is significantly impeded for larger column densities by absorption and scattering opacity that is relevant at the line energy . for the edge - on angle bin",
    "the maximum fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency is attained _",
    "well before the medium becomes compton - thick _",
    "( i.e. before @xmath18 becomes as high as @xmath68 ) .",
    "this is also true of the angle - averaged maximum , which we find occurs at @xmath18  @xmath69 .",
    "the position of the turnover can be understood as approximately corresponding to a situation for which the average optical depth to absorption plus scattering for the zeroth - order fe  k@xmath0 line photons is of order unity .",
    "the single - scattering albedo ( ratio of scattering to total cross - section ) at 6.4  kev , for the element abundances that we have adopted , is @xmath70 .",
    "the optical depth to scattering is @xmath71 , or @xmath72 , so putting @xmath73 gives @xmath74 for the peak value of @xmath39 , agreeing well with our monte carlo results .",
    "for the covering factor of 0.5 , it can seen that the fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency is never more than @xmath75 .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "2 ( dot - dashed line ) is the optically - thin limit from equation  [ eqn : thinlimit ] .",
    "it can be seen that the monte carlo curves converge to this optically - thin limit , but only for column densities @xmath76 .",
    "it can also be seen that even for column densities as low as @xmath77 ( when the thomson depth is only 0.08 ) , errors as large as @xmath37 can be incurred if one uses the optically - thin limit to calculate fe  k@xmath0 line fluxes and luminosities .",
    "this is because the important quantity that determines the observed fraction of fe  k@xmath0 line photons is the _ total _ opacity due to photoelectric absorption and scattering . at 6.4  kev ,",
    "the ratio of the absorption to scattering cross - section is @xmath78 in our model . _",
    "our results show that the optically - thin approximation should never be used to calculate or estimate fe  k@xmath0 line fluxes for @xmath18  @xmath79 or so_. the error incurred in neglecting the opacity for fe  k@xmath0 line photons to escape the medium exceeds an order of magnitude ( a factor of @xmath51 ) for a column density of @xmath80 for the face - on bin , and is nearly two orders of magnitude for the edge - on bin ( a factor of @xmath81 ) .",
    "although it is well - known that flatter incident continua give large fe  k@xmath0 line ews and fluxes ( e.g. my09 and references therein ) , _ the fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency is smaller for flatter incident continua _ ( lower values of @xmath44 ) .",
    "the reason is that steeper continua give a greater relative weight to the fe  k - shell absorption cross - section where it is largest ( i.e. at lower energies down to the fe  k edge threshold energy ) .",
    "this can be seen clearly in equation  [ eqn : thinlimit ] for the optically - thin limit , but it is true in general .",
    "we have calculated @xmath39 using various values of @xmath44 from the my09 toroidal x - ray reprocessor monte carlo results and find , rather surprisingly , that the @xmath39 versus @xmath18 curves for different power - law slopes can be accounted for by the optically - thin factor , @xmath82 in equation  [ eqn : fgam ] , even up to column densities of @xmath83 .",
    "in other words if we have curves of @xmath39 versus @xmath18 for @xmath66 , we can estimate the relation for a different value of @xmath44 by multiplying the @xmath39 versus @xmath18 relation for @xmath66 by the factor @xmath84 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  2 , where we have applied the process in reverse to the monte carlo results for the torus for @xmath85 ( dotted curves ) and @xmath86 ( dashed curves ) , for the face - on and edge - on angle bins .",
    "this range in @xmath44 of 1.52.5 covers values of the x - ray power - law continuum slope that is observationally - relevant for agn .",
    "that is , we multiplied the actual monte carlo results for @xmath85 and @xmath86 by the factor @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively . in the case that the approximation were perfect , the dotted , dashed , and solid curves in fig",
    ".  2 would be identical for a given orientation of the reprocessor .",
    "we see from fig .  2 that the error incurred in using this approximation to estimate @xmath39 from the @xmath66 results is _ in the worst case _ only @xmath89 for the face - on angle bin ( i.e. for the largest column density of @xmath90 and @xmath86 ) .",
    "for the edge - on angle bin the approximation is good to @xmath91 or better up to @xmath18  @xmath83 but increases with @xmath18 up to @xmath92 for @xmath18  @xmath93 and @xmath86 .",
    "we note that @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , so the absolute fe  k@xmath0 line efficiencies have a factor @xmath96 range for a given column density as @xmath44 varies in the observationally relevant range of 1.52.5 . in the remainder of the present paper we shall refer to values of @xmath39 for @xmath97 .",
    "results corresponding to other values of @xmath44 can then be estimated using the method described above .    for reference , fig .",
    "2 also shows ( dashed , triple - dotted line ) the efficiency of fe  k@xmath0 line production for the standard case of a face - on , centrally - illuminated semi - infinite , compton - thick disk ( e.g. george & fabian 1991 ) that subtends the same solid angle at the x - ray source as our default torus model ( i.e. @xmath34 ) .",
    "we calculated @xmath39 for the case of the disk using the hrefl disk - reflection continuum model ( see doviak , m. , karas , & yaqoob 2004 ) for a power - law incident continuum with @xmath66 , and an ew for the fe  k@xmath0 line of 143  ev ( from george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "the fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency for the disk is @xmath98 , and is a constant in fig .",
    "2 because it corresponds to a disk with a compton depth @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the reason why the disk has a higher value of @xmath39 than the maximum for the torus ( obtained for face - on reflection ) , even though both subtend a solid angle of @xmath34 at the x - ray source , is due to geometrical effects that have been discussed in detail in my09 .",
    "a higher abundance of fe , @xmath61 , will increase @xmath39 . in the optically - thin limit",
    "the increase in @xmath39 will be in direct proportion to @xmath61 .",
    "however , the total absorption opacity at 6.4  kev also increases .",
    "if @xmath61 increases by a factor 10 , the absorption opacity at 6.4  kev increases by a factor of 2.5 and the total opacity to absorption plus scattering increases by a factor 2.0 . therefore , as the column density increases , the value of @xmath39 as a function of @xmath18 will reach a maximum for smaller values of @xmath18 relative to the case for cosmic fe abundance .",
    "the maximum value for @xmath39 must be much less than the optically - thin value for these values of @xmath18 and @xmath61 ( equation  [ eqn : thinlimit ] ) .",
    "therefore , even if we increase @xmath61 by a factor of 10 relative to the cosmic value , the maximum fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency will only increase by much less than a factor of 10 .",
    "we performed some monte carlo calculations using the my09 toroidal reprocessor model with the fe abundance increased by a factor 10 relative to the cosmic value and found that the maximum fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency increased by a factor of @xmath101 , to @xmath102 , attained for a face - on inclination angle , and @xmath18  @xmath103 . for an edge - on inclination angle the maximum value of @xmath39 increased by a factor of @xmath104 relative to the cosmic fe abundance value , to @xmath105 , for @xmath18  @xmath106 .",
    "the calculations in the present paper pertain specifically to neutral matter .",
    "ionization states of fe higher than fe  xvii are not relevant to our discussion because we are making predictions for the fe  k@xmath0 line in agn that peaks at 6.4  kev .",
    "even ionization states of fe  xvii give an fe  k@xmath0 line energy that is higher than observed ( @xmath107  kev e.g .",
    "palmeri et al . 2003 ; mendoza et al . 2004 ) , and ionization states of fe  xii or lower are likely to be more appropriate ( e.g. see yaqoob et al .",
    "mild ionization will have the effect of increasing the fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency due to the reduced absorption opacities impeding the escape of line photons .",
    "we have investigated the effect of mild ionization on the fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency in the context of the my09 toroidal reprocessor model using a simple approach that gives a conservative upper limit on the fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency .",
    "we used the xstar photoionization code ( e.g. kallman et al .",
    "2004 ) to estimate the ionization parameter , @xmath108 , , where @xmath109 is the ionizing luminosity between 11000 rydberg , @xmath110 is the proton density , and @xmath111 is the distance between the ionizing source and the illuminated surface of the matter . ] for which the fe  k edge energy moves to @xmath112  kev ( appropriate for fe  xii  see verner et al . 1996 ) , up from the neutral fe value of @xmath113  kev .",
    "although the geometry assumed by xstar is a spherical shell , our simple approach will still give a useful upper limit because in practice only the inner surface of the toroidal reprocessor will be ionized but we simply substituted the total absorption opacities for all elements throughout the torus with the reduced opacities calculated by xstar .",
    "we used a column density of @xmath114 but calculated the absorption cross - sections per unit column density so that we could scale the cross - section for other column densities when applied in the toroidal monte carlo code . for a column density of @xmath114 we found an upper limit on @xmath115 of 1.8 for the fe k edge threshold energy to remain below @xmath112  kev .",
    "thus we used the total absorption cross - section for @xmath116 throughout the torus .",
    "again , this procedure will underestimate the absorption at the energy of the fe  k@xmath0 line , consistent with the goal of obtaining a conservative upper limit to the fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency .",
    "we retained the k - shell cross - section for neutral fe because it decreases slowly with increasing ionization state .",
    "we also retained the fluorescence yield for neutral fe , which increases slowly with increasing ionization state .",
    "the changes in both k - shell cross - section and fluorescence yield are less than 15% up to fe  xvii , and the opposite sense of the changes tend to compensate each other ( e.g. bambynek et al . 1972 ) to some extent .",
    "we obtained the result that , using these very conservative assumptions , the maximum fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency increases to 1.8% , the maximum being obtained for the same column density and orientation as the strictly neutral torus ( i.e. a face - on inclination angle and @xmath117 , or @xmath118 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum enhancement in the fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency of @xmath119 for mild ionization compared to the case of purely neutral matter .",
    "in the limit when a medium is optically - thin to absorption and scattering in the fe  k band ( @xmath5-@xmath6  kev ) , the relation between the fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency and @xmath18 is identical for all geometries for a given covering factor . the efficiency , @xmath39 ,",
    "can then be found from equation  [ eqn : thinlimit ] for any covering factor .",
    "the column density that is relevant for a given geometry is the average over all incident rays from the x - ray source , over all lines - of - sight that intercept the reprocessing structure . in terms of achieving the highest fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency",
    ", there is a trade - off with the solid angle subtended by the structure at the x - ray source , or covering factor .",
    "larger solid angles obviously intercept more continuum photons to produce more fe  k@xmath0 line photons , but if the solid angle becomes too large , the escape of fe  k@xmath0 line photons could be impeded ( e.g. see discussion in ikeda et al .",
    "the optimum opening angle for the maximum fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency depends on the geometry and the observer s line - of - sight to the reprocessor . the maximum fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency will always be achieved for lines of sight that are unobscured . for the toroidal geometry of my09",
    ", a maximum efficiency , @xmath120 , is achieved for a covering factor of @xmath35\\sim 0.8 - 0.9 $ ] for @xmath121 ( and a face - on orientation ) , before the medium becomes compton - thick .",
    "the my09 monte carlo code is adaptable for different geometries and we have used it to compare the fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency obtained from a toroidal geometry with the case of a centrally - illuminated , fully - covering sphere , and an externally - illuminated sphere . for the former , we found that @xmath39 has a broad peak as a function of ( radial ) @xmath10 , in the region @xmath122 , achieving a maximum value of @xmath123 . in the case of the externally - illuminated sphere",
    ", we assumed a parallel beam incident on one side of the sphere and calculated @xmath39 as a function of the angle between the escaping line photons and the incident beam . in a clumpy medium the escaping line radiation",
    "would then consist of an appropriate angle - averaged spectrum over a distribution of such `` blobs '' ( e.g. see also nandra & george 1994 ; miller , turner , & reeves , 2009 for discussion of such scenarios ) . the appropriate mean column density , @xmath22 , for an externally - illuminated sphere is @xmath124 of the equatorial column density .",
    "we find that for an individual blob , not surprisingly , the maximum fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency , @xmath125 , is achieved for line photons escaping in a direction anti - parallel to the incident radiation , from the illuminated face , for @xmath22  @xmath126 .",
    "for this column density , the maximum efficiency for fe  k@xmath0 line emission from the opposite face , parallel to the incident radiation is @xmath127 , for @xmath22  @xmath128@xmath129 .",
    "the angle - averaged value of @xmath39 ( over @xmath130@xmath131 ) peaks at @xmath132 for @xmath22  @xmath133@xmath134 in addition to the angular averaging , for a clumpy medium one must account for the volume filling factor and covering factor of such blobs , and for interaction of line photons with multiple clouds . these effects can decrease the maximum fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency , and in fact , as the covering factor and filling factor tend towards unity , @xmath39 has to tend to the value for a centrally - illuminated sphere , or @xmath123 . for any reprocessor geometry ,",
    "the general behavior of @xmath39 as a function of mean column density is the same .",
    "that is , a rise to a maximum , followed by a decline that is steeper the more heavily obscured the line of sight is .",
    "the column density for which the maximum is achieved will be in the range @xmath135 , with the largest values of @xmath22 and @xmath39 at the maximum corresponding to unobscured ( pure reflection ) lines of sight . however , none of the geometries that we have considered here ( for cosmic abundances and neutral matter ) give a value of @xmath39 greater than @xmath136 ( for @xmath66 ) , for any covering factor , column density , or line of sight .",
    "our results also emphasize that the fe  k@xmath0 emission line can not be trivially used as a proxy for the intrinsic continuum luminosity in obscured agn .",
    "it has been postulated that since the fe  k@xmath0 line luminosity samples the intrinsic continuum over a large fraction of the sky , as seen from the x - ray source , it might be a good indicator of the intrinsic continuum luminosity , given that the line - of - sight may not be representative of the column density for the bulk of the reprocessor .",
    "however , we have shown that the dependence of the luminosity of the fe  k@xmath0 line on the geometry , inclination angle , @xmath18 , and @xmath61 is sufficiently complex that such a use of the fe  k@xmath0 line can not be trivially implemented .",
    "in particular , as a function of @xmath18 , the fe  k@xmath0 line luminosity is double - valued .",
    "however , we can obtain a lower limit on the intrinsic luminosity .",
    "we have shown that regardless of geometry , inclination , and the column density of the reprocessor , for a given @xmath44 and @xmath61 , there is a maximum possible value for @xmath39 if one can be certain that the dominant species of fe are fe  xii or less .",
    "we can measure @xmath44 , and there may be independent constraints on @xmath61 . therefore ,",
    "if we measure a flux or luminosity of the fe  k@xmath0 line , the lower bound on such a measurement implies a lower limit on the intrinsic continuum luminosity that corresponds to the maximum efficiency .",
    "we can apply our results to the case of the well - known seyfert galaxy mcg  @xmath36 - 30 - 15 .",
    "this agn has been the archetypal x - ray source for harboring a broad , relativistic fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "however , miller , turner , & reeves ( 2008 ) showed that absorption - dominated models that do not require a relativistically - broadened fe  k@xmath0 line are also consistent with the x - ray data .",
    "reynolds et al .",
    "( 2009 ) claimed that such absorption - dominated models over - predict the flux of the narrow fe  k@xmath0 emission - line at @xmath2  kev and concluded that a finely - tuned model with a small covering factor is required .",
    "here we show that this conclusion is invalid on the basis of simple physics .",
    "mcg  @xmath36 - 30 - 15 has a typical narrow fe  k@xmath0 line at 6.4  kev with a measured flux of @xmath137 ( yaqoob & padmanabhan 2004 ) . the time - averaged 210 kev flux from a very long @xmath138  ks _ xmm - newton _ observation ( fabian et al . 2002 ; doviak et al .",
    "2004 ) was @xmath139 ( a value this is representative of historical behavior  see markowitz et al .",
    "2003 ) , and @xmath66 is typical .",
    "therefore , we obtain a photon flux above the fe  k edge of @xmath140 . using our general result of a maximum fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency of @xmath136",
    "we get an fe  k@xmath0 line flux of @xmath141 . thus , no matter what distribution of cold / neutral matter that we place around the x - ray source in mcg  @xmath36 - 30 - 15 , regardless of column density , covering factor , or geometry",
    ", we can not obtain an fe  k@xmath0 line flux much greater than @xmath141 .",
    "miller et al . ( 2009 ) presented similar conclusions for the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line flux in mcg  @xmath36 - 30 - 15 .",
    "this is a very generous upper limit because it requires optimal values for the column density and covering factor , and a line - of - sight that does not intercept the line emitter .",
    "obviously , a large column density in the line - of - sight will reduce the predicted fe  k@xmath0 line flux . for example , for @xmath142 , and a spherical geometry with a covering factor of 0.5 , the predicted fe  k@xmath0 line flux is very small , just @xmath143 .",
    "a similar value is obtained from the my09 edge - on toroidal x - ray reprocessor model ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "reynolds et al .",
    "( 2009 ) obtained estimates of the fe  k@xmath0 line flux in mcg  @xmath36 - 30 - 15 based on a simple cold , cosmic abundance absorber with @xmath144 .",
    "however , they used an optically - thin approximation for a manifestly optically - thick scenario . specifically , they used a column density that is one hundred times higher than the value for which that approximation begins to breaks down ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and consequently obtained an effective efficiency that is unphysical .",
    "reynolds et al .",
    "( 2009 ) therefore obtained a very high fe  k@xmath0 line flux ( @xmath145 ) that is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that expected for their assumed column density and covering factor ( @xmath142 and 0.35 respectively ) .",
    "they also gained a factor of @xmath146 in the fe  k@xmath0 line flux by assuming that _ all _ of the continuum photons absorbed above the fe  k edge are absorbed by the fe  k shell , whereas in fact the true fraction is 0.510.61 ( see  [ lineflux ] ) .",
    "the fe  k@xmath0 emission - line flux or luminosity is nontrivial to calculate because the optically - thin approximation ( with respect to absorption and scattering in the @xmath5@xmath6  kev band ) breaks down for column densities as small as @xmath147 .",
    "inappropriate use of the optically - thin approximation can lead to estimates of the line flux that are orders of magnitude too large .",
    "we have given a prescription for estimating the fe  k@xmath0 line flux in the case of neutral matter with cosmic abundances , for some very general situations .",
    "we have characterized the line flux in terms of a dimensionless _ efficiency _ , @xmath39 , defined as the ratio of the flux in the line to that in the incident continuum above the fe  k absorption edge threshold energy .",
    "we refer to values of @xmath39 that pertain to a power - law slope of the incident x - ray continuum of @xmath66 but have given a simple prescription for scaling @xmath39 to other values of @xmath44 in the range 1.52.5 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath39depends on the geometry , covering factor , and orientation , and is always obtained for lines of sight to the x - ray reprocessor that are unobscured . in general , this maximum is achieved before the structure becomes compton - thick , for mean column densities in the range @xmath148 . for the toroidal geometry of my09 the maximum fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency is attained for nearly full covering ( @xmath35 \\sim 0.9 $ ] ) , before the medium becomes compton - thick , and is @xmath120 .",
    "this can be compared with the maximum value of @xmath39 for a uniform , centrally - illuminated sphere of @xmath123 .",
    "a clumpy distribution of matter can give somewhat higher fe  k@xmath0 line efficiencies , of the order of @xmath149 .",
    "regardless of geometry and covering factor , for cosmic abundances and incident continua with a power - law photon index of 1.9 or less , none of the geometries considered yields an fe  k@xmath0 line efficiency greater than @xmath136 .",
    "steeper incident continua can give a higher efficiency but we find that for @xmath86 it is only a factor of @xmath150 higher .",
    "x - ray sources that are compton - thick in the line of sight can have fe  k@xmath0 line efficiencies that are an order of magnitude or more smaller than the maximum for a given geometry . for example the my09 toroidal geometry viewed edge - on has @xmath39  @xmath151 , and @xmath39  @xmath152 for column densities of @xmath80 and @xmath90 respectively .",
    "we have applied our results to the seyfert galaxy mcg  @xmath36 - 30 - 15 to show that absorption - dominated models for the broad , relativistic fe  k@xmath0 emission line _ do not _ over - predict the flux of the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line for any column density or covering factor .",
    "recent claims to the contrary by reynolds et al .",
    "( 2009 ) are based on an invalid treatment of the problem .",
    "our results also emphasize the fact that the absolute luminosity of the fe  k@xmath0 emission line in obscured astrophysical sources can not be used as a proxy for the intrinsic continuum luminosity in a trivial way .",
    "using both the fe  k@xmath0 line flux _ and _ ew does provide additional constraints but the intrinsic continuum luminosity may still be uncertain because of the complex dependencies upon fe abundance , geometry , covering factor , and system orientation .",
