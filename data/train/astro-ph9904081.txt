    "m82 is the best studied nearby starburst galaxy ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the central few hundred parsecs of this galaxy are heavily obscured by dust and gas which hides the central starburst region against direct observations at optical wavelengths .",
    "evidence for strong star ",
    "forming activity in the central region comes from radio ( e.g. kronberg @xcite ) and infrared observations ( e.g. telesco   @xcite ) and also from the prominent bipolar outflow visible in  ( e.g. bland & tully @xcite , mckeith  @xcite , shopbell & bland ",
    "hawthorn @xcite ) and in x - rays ( e.g. bregman  @xcite ) .",
    "the massive star formation ( sf ) is believed to be fuelled by the large amount of molecular gas which is present in the centre of m82 .",
    "on the other hand , sf effects the distribution and kinematics of the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "recent millimetre continuum observations ( carlstrom & kronberg @xcite ) suggested that the hii regions in m82 have swept up most of the surrounding neutral gas and dust into dense shells .",
    "this is in agreement with the standard picture : shells are created by young star  forming regions through strong stellar winds of the most massive stars in a cluster and through subsequent type  ii supernovae ( e.g.  tenorio  tagle & bodenheimer @xcite ) .",
    "these processes are thought to blow huge cavities filled with coronal gas into their ambient ism ( e.g.  cox & smith @xcite , weaver @xcite ) .",
    "this hot interior is then believed to drive the expansion of the outer shell of swept  up material .    once superbubbles reach sizes that are comparable to the thickness of a galaxy s disk , the bubble will eventually break out into the halo .",
    "this then leads to an outflow of the hot gas with velocities much higher than the expansion of the shell within the disk of the galaxy . in the following we present evidence for a molecular superbubble in m82 which already broke out of the disk and seems to contribute significantly to the well  known prominent outflow of m82",
    "for our analysis we used the  data cube obtained by shen & lo ( @xcite ) with the bima array ( spatial resolution : @xmath8 ) and the  data cube from neininger  ( @xcite ) observed with the platau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) ( spatial resolution : @xmath9 ) .",
    "in addition , we used unpublished pdbi data of the  and  transitions .",
    "these observations where carried out in april 1997 in the cd configuration , resulting in a spatial resolution of @xmath10 ( ) and @xmath11 ( ) , and a velocity resolution of 3.3  and 6.8 , respectively . in order to increase",
    "the sensitivity to extended co emission we combined the  data cube with single dish measurements obtained with the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "these observations were carried out in may 1998 .",
    "the combination is essential for this particular study because the receding part of the superbubble is only marginally visible in the mere interferometer maps .",

    "hardly any co emission with a velocity between @xmath21 and @xmath22 is found south and north of snr 41.9 + 58 .",

    ". it should be noted , however , that snr 41.9 + 58 is only about 50 years old ( wilkinson & de bruyn @xcite ) and therefore can not be the source that drives the expansion of the superbubble .",

    "[ [ neutral - hydrogen - hi ] ] neutral hydrogen ( hi ) : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    h  emission line studies show that the central kpc of m82 is dominated by absorption ( yun  @xcite ) , which makes it difficult to study the h  kinematics in the central part of the galaxy .",
    "recent habsorption studies against supernova remnants in m82 by wills ( @xcite ) disclosed two absorption features against snr 41.9 + 58 .",
    "the velocities of the components are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the h  component at 87  can be attributed to the approaching component of the expanding superbubble .",
    "the absorption feature at 200 , if associated with the receding part , seems to contradict the hypothesis that snr 41.9 + 58 is located within the expanding superbubble .",

    "[ [ optical - observations ] ] optical observations : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    optical observations of the centre of m82 suffer heavily from light absorption by the prominent dust lanes , rendering an optical analysis of this particular region impossible .",

    "the positions of the three point sources in the field are marked with stars , snr 41.9 + 58 is marked by a cross ( see also bregman ) .",
    "the overlay shows that most of the diffuse x  ray emission arises from the vicinity of snr 41.9 + 58 .",
    "the shape of the diffuse emission is elongated , extending several arcminutes along the minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "model calculations by bregman  show that the emission is consistent with an outflow of heated material from the central region coincident with the position of the expanding molecular superbubble .",
    "we estimate an upper limit for the energy still present in the hot gas emerging from the superbubble . for the calculation",
    "we adopt a density @xmath28 and a temperature @xmath29 for the central region ( bregman ) as an upper limit for the mean values in the outflow .",
    "we find an upper limit for the energy of @xmath30ergs present in a cylindrical volume with @xmath31 and @xmath32 centred on the superbubble . from the thickness of the molecular disk of m82 ( @xmath33 ) and the expansion velocity of the superbubble",
    "we estimate a time elapsed since outbreak of @xmath34 .",
    "the required outflow velocity to reach the observed height above the disk therefore is @xmath35 .",

    "[ ionized - gas ] ] ionized gas : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    most studies of the ionized gas in m82 unfortunately do not provide sufficient spatial and spectral resolution to reveal details of the region under study .",

    "cut along the major axis clearly shows a disturbed velocity field in the vicinity of snr 41.9 + 58 .",
    "the approaching side of the expanding superbubble at 95  is clearly visible while the receding side at 190  is only marginally seen .",
    "the diameter of the ne shell ( @xmath0100pc ) seems to be somewhat smaller than the corresponding co feature , suggesting that the inner part of the expanding superbubble is ionized .",
    "similar features are visible in the distribution and the kinematics of the h41@xmath36 emission line ( seaquist  @xcite ) .",
    "the ne distribution might represent the transition from the hot coronal gas with a temperature of several @xmath37k towards the cold molecular rim of the superbubble .",
    "the picture that emerges from the observations presented above is the following : a major sf event at the centre of what today shows up as the prominent expanding molecular superbubble created a cavity filled with coronal gas by the combined effects of strong stellar winds and sn explosions .",
    "the pressure of the hot  gas interior drove the expansion of the shell of swept  up material until it broke out of the disk .",
    "the subsequent outflow of hot material today shows up as diffuse x  ray emission and contributes to the prominent  filaments .    from the observational parameters of the expanding superbubble ( expansion velocity and diameter ) we estimate a kinematic age of the superbubble of @xmath38 years .",
    "the kinematic age is an upper limit for the actual age since the superbubble is most probably decelerating .",
    "we use chevalier s equation ( chevalier @xcite ) to derive the amount of energy needed to create the expanding superbubble .",
    "since chevalier s equation applies to h  shells only we corrected the energy input by a factor of 2 to correct for the difference in mass between  and h. we estimate an ambient  density prior to the creation of the shell of order @xmath39 .",
    "this is done by converting the  line integral to  column density using a conversion ratio of n()/w(co ) = @xmath40 @xmath41 k@xmath5 km@xmath5s ( smith  @xcite ) and estimating the volume of the region from which material was swept up to be cylindrical with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we derive a total energy of order @xmath44ergs , which corresponds to an energy equivalent of approximately 1000 type  ii sne and the strong stellar winds of their progenitors . with the estimate for the age of the superbubble this leads to a sn rate of 0.001 sn yr@xmath5 for the central stellar cluster .",
    "this is a reasonable number given the fact that the sn rate in the central part of m82 was estimated to be about 0.1 sn yr@xmath5 ( kronberg  @xcite ) .",
    "the total  mass of the superbubble is about @xmath45 .",
    "less than 15% of the total energy is still present in the hot gas which emerges from the superbubble ; the fraction of kinetic energy of the molecular superbubble is about 10% ( @xmath46ergs ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the numbers given above are only order of magnitude estimates .",
    "the wealth of observations presented above indicates that the region under study represents an unusually active segment of the starburst in m82 .",
    "the finding of an expanding molecular superbubble in this particular region supports this view and provides clear evidence for a footprint of violent sf in the ism of m82 .",
    "furthermore the analysis of the molecular superbubble presents an alternative tool to investigate the energy release of the central source which drives the x  ray and contributes to the  outflow ."
