    "in nearby cold dark clouds , carbon - chain molecules such as hc@xmath0n and ccs , and n - bearing molecules such as nh@xmath0 and n@xmath2h@xmath3 , are thought to be good tracers of chemical evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "carbon - chain molecules are produced in chemically young evolutionary stages by ion - molecular reactions and depleted through both the gas - phase reactions and the adsorption onto dust grains ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , n@xmath2h@xmath3 is produced in later evolutionary stages and is hardly depleted compared with other species because the nitrogen molecule n@xmath2 ( the precursor of n@xmath2h@xmath3 ) is produced in late stages of the gas - phase chemistry ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that carbon - chain molecules , ccs and hc@xmath0n , trace the early chemical evolutionary stage , whereas n - bearing molecules , nh@xmath0 and n@xmath2h@xmath3 , trace later stages of the chemical evolution .",
    "@xcite observed ccs ( @xmath9 ) , hc@xmath0n ( @xmath10 ) , and nh@xmath0 ( @xmath11 ) emission toward nearby cold dark cores and found that ccs and hc@xmath0n are abundant in starless cores while nh@xmath0 is abundant in star - forming cores .",
    "@xcite observed the ccs ( @xmath12 ) and n@xmath2h@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) emission toward dense cores in nearby cold dark clouds , and showed that the column density of ccs is anticorrelated with that of n@xmath2h@xmath3 among the cores .",
    "therefore , it is established that the column density ratios of n - bearing molecules to carbon chain molecules can be indicators of chemical evolution , in cold dark clouds .    on the other hand ,",
    "the chemical evolution of molecular dense cores located in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) has not been extensively explored in comparison with that of nearby cold dark clouds .",
    "the dense cores in nearby dark clouds are known to be cold ( @xmath13 k ) , less turbulent , and show isolated low mass star - forming region , while those in gmcs are warmer , turbulent , and often show the formation of star clusters .",
    "because most stars in the galaxy are formed in gmcs , it is of great interest to know whether or not these molecules are indicators of chemical evolution in gmcs .",
    "it has been shown that the column density ratios of nh@xmath0/hc@xmath0n , nh@xmath0/ccs , and n@xmath2h@xmath3/ccs are low in starless regions , while they are high in star - forming cores in the orion a gmc @xcite .",
    "they suggested that these molecules may be indicators of the chemical evolution in the orion a gmc .",
    "@xcite observed ccs and nh@xmath0 emission toward a starless core in the orion a gmc with the very large array , and revealed that the ccs emission surrounds the nh@xmath0 core .",
    "this configuration resembles that of the n@xmath2h@xmath3 and ccs distribution in the taurus l1544 prestellar core showing the collapsing motion .",
    "it is needed to establish whether these molecules can generally be indicators of the chemical evolution even in gmcs by investigating dense cores located in other gmcs .",
    "we focus on one of near gmcs located in the southern hemisophere , vela c molecular cloud complex .",
    "the vela molecular clouds or ` vela molecular ridge ' @xcite is one of closest gmcs within the galactic plane , and consists of four components labelled a through d. the vela c giant molecular cloud complex is the most massive component of the vela region , and accompanies a bright hii region , rcw 36 , associated with an early type star ( spectral type o5-b0 ) @xcite .",
    "the distance is 700 pc @xcite .",
    "@xcite mapped @xmath14co , @xmath15co , and c@xmath16o ( @xmath4 ) lines in vela c , and detected molecular outflows .",
    "by @xmath17 pacs and spire observations at 70 , 160 , 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath18 m dust continuum emission , @xcite identified high column density filaments over the whole region , and showed differences in their column density and temperature probability distribution function ( pdf ) among regions .",
    "they revealed that the column density pdf of the ` centre - ridge region ' , which contains a high - mass star , is flatter than other regions , and shows a high column density tail .    in this study , we investigate the chemical characteristics of molecular cloud cores in the vela c giant molecular cloud complex through mapping observations of hc@xmath0n and n@xmath2h@xmath3 .",
    "the purpose of this study is to investigate whether hc@xmath0n ( a carbon - chain molecule ) and n@xmath2h@xmath3 ( a n - bearing molecule ) are indicators of chemical evolution in a gmc .",
    "observations were carried out by the mopra 22 m telescope located in australia from 2014 may 10 to 25 .",
    "we used the 3 mm mmic receiver that can simultaneously record dual polarization data .",
    "we simultaneously observed hc@xmath0n ( @xmath1 ) at 90.978989 ghz and n@xmath2h@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) at 93.1737767 ghz .",
    "the employed spectrometer was the mopra spectrometer ( mops ) digital filter bank in the zoom - band mode .",
    "the spectral resolution was 33.57 khz ( @xmath19 km s@xmath20 ) . at 90 ghz , the half - power beam width",
    "( hpbw ) and `` extended beam efficiency '' of the telescope are 42and 50% , respectively @xcite .",
    "we observed source 81 of the vela - d molecular cloud identified by @xcite once a day to check the stability of the intensity calibration .",
    "the absolute intensity accuracy was estimated to be less than 10% .",
    "we mapped 5@xmath21 @xmath22 5@xmath21 box areas in the on - the - fly ( otf ) mode .",
    "we observed a total of 7 regions , which were selected from bright c@xmath16o emission peaks .",
    "the c@xmath16o @xmath23 observations were previously carried out by @xcite with 2@xmath21 resolution .",

    "the black boxes indicate otf mapping area and white contours represent the n@xmath2h@xmath3 @xmath4 velocity - integrated intensity map .",
    "the obtained data were smoothed to a hpbw of 53@xmath5 with a 2d gaussian function in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the angular resolution is equivalent to 0.2 pc at a distance of 700 pc .",
    "it is worth noting that this resolution will identify objects that will form groups of stars .",
    "the typical rms noise level is about 0.08 k per channel .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked every 1.0 hour by observing the sio maser source l2 pup ( ra , dec ( j2000 ) @xmath25 7@xmath2613@xmath2732@xmath2831 , -44@xmath2938@xmath2124@xmath301 ) .",
    "the pointing accuracy was better than 10@xmath5 .",
    "the upper energy levels ( @xmath31 ) for hc@xmath0n ( @xmath1 ) and n@xmath2h@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) transitions are 24.01 and 4.47 k , respectively .",
    "the critical densities for these transitions are @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath34 at 20 k , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that n@xmath2h@xmath3 is excited at lower densities than the critical density , and the effective excitation densities may be lower than @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "the observed data were reduced using `` livedata '' and `` gridzilla '' , which are the most typical data reduction packages for the mopra telescope .",
    "`` livedata '' fits and subtracts a linear baseline .",
    "the output of `` livedata '' is recorded in single - dish fits format ( sdfits ) .",
    "`` gridzilla '' uses this output to regrid data onto a data cube using a gaussian smoothing . the final data cubes were smoothed to 15@xmath5 grid size .",

    "we also plot protostar candidates identified by the near - infrared ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) survey carried out by @xcite and akari - fis point source catalogue , which are class 0 protostellar candidates @xcite .",
    "we identified 25 local peaks in the velocity - integrated intensity maps of the hc@xmath0n @xmath1 and/or n@xmath2h@xmath3 @xmath4 emission in these 7 regions .",
    "the criteria for identification are more than five sigma above the noise level for n@xmath2h@xmath3 and/or three sigma above the noise level for hc@xmath0n . if the hc@xmath0n peak is within the hpbw of the n@xmath2h@xmath3 peak , we use the hc@xmath0n peak position .",
    "the identification of n@xmath2h@xmath3 emission peaks is more strict so that we can perform hyperfine fitting to satellite components . in table",
    "[ tab : hc3n ] , we list the positions of the detected hc@xmath0n @xmath1 and/or n@xmath2h@xmath3 @xmath4 local peaks in the velocity - integrated intensity map and the line parameters of the hc@xmath0n spectra measured toward these positions .",
    "the peak intensities and linewidths are obtained through gaussian fitting .",
    "if local intensity peaks coincide with the protostars within 53@xmath5 , we define the peaks as star - forming cores .",
    "if local intensity peaks do not coincide with the protostars , we define the peaks as starless cores .",
    "a total of 12 peak positions were identified as star - forming .",
    "we assume that both lines trace sufficiently dense gas , and the starless cores identified in these lines will eventually form protostars .",
    "we found that the distributions of the hc@xmath0n and n@xmath2h@xmath3 velocity - integrated intensities are similar to each other , suggesting that these molecular lines trace the same dense cores .",
    "taking into account the fact that the scale of different distributions between hc@xmath0n and n@xmath2h@xmath3 occurs at 0.1 pc scales in omc-3 region ( @xcite ) , less prominent differences of intensity distributions would be due to our larger spatial resolution of 0.19 pc .",

    "these results suggest that the carbon - chain molecules ( hc@xmath0n and ccs ) trace chemically young gas , while n - bearing molecules ( n@xmath2h@xmath3 and nh@xmath0 ) trace later stages of chemical evolution .",
    "we investigate whether n@xmath2h@xmath3/hc@xmath0n abundance ratio can be an indicator of the chemical evolution in the vela c. figure [ column ] shows the column density of n@xmath2h@xmath3 against that of hc@xmath0n .",
    "we found a positive correlation between these column densities .",
    "we also found a systematic difference in the column densities between the star - forming and starless peaks .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the column density ratio of n@xmath2h@xmath3/hc@xmath0n against the linewidth of hc@xmath0n .",
    "we find , on average , that the column density ratio of n@xmath2h@xmath3/hc@xmath0n seems to be low toward starless peaks while it seems to be high toward star - forming peaks .",
    "the average value of the n@xmath2h@xmath3/hc@xmath0n abundance ratio , excluding the data with upper limits , is 1.6@xmath133 for star - forming ( median value is 1.5 ) and 1.2@xmath121 for starless peaks",
    "( median value is 0.9 ) .",
    "this is similar to the tendency found in the orion a gmc and nearby cold dark clouds .",
    "@xcite suggested that column density ratio of nh@xmath0/hc@xmath0n decreases with increasing linewidth of hc@xmath0n in the orion a cloud .",
    "however , we found no correlation between column density ratio of n@xmath2h@xmath3/hc@xmath0n and linewidths . the criterion between star - forming and starless in the vela c",
    "is found around n@xmath2h@xmath3/hc@xmath0n @xmath6 1.4 .",
    "that is , n@xmath2h@xmath3/hc@xmath0n may be @xmath134 1.4 in starless peaks , and @xmath135 1.4 in star - forming peaks .",
    "differences in the filling factors of these two molecules may affect the column density ratio .",
    "if the filling factor is equal to 0.5 , the column density is @xmath136 times higher than that in the case of unity . without having precise measurements of the filling factor",
    ", we assume the same filling factor , that is , unity for both of them .",
    "even if the filling factor of hc@xmath0n is systematically larger or smaller than that of n@xmath2h@xmath3 , we will obtain the same tendency in comparison between starless and star - forming peaks , although the absolute value of the ratio may change .",
    "it should be noting that the uncertainties of the ratios are still large and we have to confirm these trends with high sensitivity observations in future .",
    "@xcite observed ccs @xmath137 and n@xmath2h@xmath3 @xmath4 emission toward dense cores in the orion a cloud , and showed a clearer boundary between star - forming and starless at @xmath6 @xmath138 ( see their figure 20 ) .",
    "however , in the present study , the boundary between star - forming and starless is less evident .",
    "our large beam observations may have failed to resolve the core .",
    "if so , the column density of hc@xmath0n may be underestimated with our observations , and the column density ratio of n@xmath2h@xmath3/hc@xmath0n will become smaller than our estimate in such cold dense regions .",
    "furthermore , identifications of protostars may not be complete in the vela c. @xcite identified protostars if 70 @xmath18 m flux obtained by the @xmath17 @xmath37 @xmath38 is more than 3 @xmath54 from the best modified black body fit .",
    "embedded protostars may not be identified by these criteria and we may have misidentified star - forming cores as starless cores . finally , it may be also possible that the hc@xmath0n @xmath1 transition is not a appropriate chemical evolution tracer as the ccs @xmath137 transition .",
    "this is because the upper state energy for the hc@xmath0n @xmath1 transition is @xmath6 24 k , which is higher than that for the ccs @xmath137 transition of @xmath6 15 k. the hc@xmath0n @xmath1 transition may be emitted in warm gas in star - forming regions rather than in young cold gas .",
    "it is also known that hc@xmath0n emissions show the wing emission toward orion kl @xcite and strong emission in the circumnuclear disk of ngc 1068 @xcite .",
    "the hc@xmath0n molecule will not trace always chemically young gas .",
    "finally , figure [ fig3 ] plots the column density ratio of n@xmath2h@xmath3/hc@xmath0n against galactic longitude .",
    "the lower longitude corresponds to the northern part of the vela c and the higher longitude corresponds to the southern part .",
    "the boundary between star - forming and starless cores may remain unchanged along the different locations of the cores .",
    "we find no evidence for global chemical variation in vela c , in contrast as has been observed in orion a gmc by @xcite .",
    "we have observed the hc@xmath0n @xmath139 and n@xmath2h@xmath3 @xmath23 lines toward the vela c molecular cloud .",
    "we found , on average , that n@xmath2h@xmath3/hc@xmath0n abundance ratio tends to be low in starless peaks while it tends to be high in star - forming peaks .",
    "this tendency is consistent with those found in the orion a cloud and dark clouds .",
    "the criterion between star - forming and starless found in the vela c may be at @xmath63(n@xmath2h@xmath3)/@xmath63(hc@xmath0n ) @xmath61.5 .",
    "however , this separation is not clear compared with that of @xmath63(n@xmath2h@xmath3)/@xmath63(ccs ) in the orion a cloud , suggesting either that our spatial resolution of 0.19 pc is insufficient to resolve spatial distribution differences between hc@xmath0n and n@xmath2h@xmath3 , the identification of protostars may be incomplete , or the hc@xmath0n @xmath1 transition is not an appropriate chemical indicator in comparison with the ccs @xmath137 transition .",
