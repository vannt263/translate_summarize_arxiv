    "in the past few years , social media services as well as the users who subscribe to them , have grown at a phenomenal rate .",
    "this immense growth has been witnessed all over the world with millions of people of different backgrounds using these services on a daily basis . this widespread generation and consumption of content",
    "has created an extremely complex and competitive online environment where different types of content compete with each other for the attention of users .",
    "it is very interesting to study how certain types of content such as a viral video , a news article , or an illustrative picture , manage to attract more attention than others , thus bubbling to the top in terms of popularity . through their visibility ,",
    "these popular topics contribute to the collective awareness reflecting what is considered important .",
    "it can also be powerful enough to affect the public agenda of the community .",
    "there have been prior studies on the characteristics of trends and trend - setters in western online social media ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper , we examine in detail a significantly less - studied but equally fascinating online environment : chinese social media , in particular , sina weibo : china s biggest microblogging network .    over the years",
    "there have been news reports on various internet phenomena in china , from the surfacing of certain viral videos to the spreading of rumors ( @xcite ) to the so called `` human flesh search engines '' : a primarily chinese internet phenomenon of massive search using online media such as blogs and forums ( @xcite ) .",
    "these stories seem to suggest that many events happening in chinese online social networks are unique products of china s culture and social environment .",
    "due to the vast global connectivity provided by social media , netizens all over the world are now connected to each other like never before ; they can now share and exchange ideas with ease .",
    "it could be argued that the manner in which the sharing occurs should be similar across countries .",
    "however , china s unique cultural and social environment suggests that the way individuals share ideas might be different than that in western societies @xcite . for example , the age of internet users in china is a lot younger .",
    "so it is likely that they may respond to different types of content than internet users in western societies . the number of internet users in china is larger than that in the u.s , and the majority of users live in large urban cities .",
    "one would expect that the way these users share information can be even more chaotic .",
    "an important question to ask is to what extent would topics have to compete with each other in order to capture users attention in this dynamic environment .",
    "furthermore , as documented by @xcite , it is known that the information shared between individuals in chinese social media is monitored .",
    "hence another interesting question to ask is what types of content would netizens respond to and what kind of popular topics would emerge u nder such constant surveillance .    given the above questions , we present an analysis on the evolution of trends in sina weibo .",
    "we monitored the evolution of the top trending keywords in sina weibo for 30 days .",
    "first , we analyzed the model of growth in these trends and examined the persistance of these topics over time . in this regard",
    ", we investigated if topics initially ranked higher tend to stay in the list of top 50 trending topics longer .",
    "subsequently , by analyzing the timestamps of tweets , we looked at the propagation and decaying process of the trends in sina weibo and compare it to earlier observations of twitter @xcite .",
    "our findings are as follows :    * we discovered that the majority of trends in sina weibo are arising from frivolous content , such as jokes and funny images and photos unlike twitter where the trends are mainly news - driven .",
    "* we established that retweets play a greater role in sina weibo than in twitter , contributing more to the generation and persistence of trends . * upon examining the tweets in detail , we made an important discovery .",
    "we observed that many trending keywords in sina weibo are heavily manipulated and controlled by certain fraudulent accounts .",
    "the irregular activities by these accounts made certain tweets more visible to users in general .",
    "* we found significant evidence suggesting that a large percentage of the trends in sina weibo are due to artificial inflation by fraudulent accounts .",
    "the users we identified as fraudulent were 1.08% of the total users sampled , but they were responsible for 49% of the total retweets ( 32% of the total tweets ) . * we evaluated some methods to identify fraudulent accounts .",
    "after we removed the tweets associated with fraudulent accounts , the evolution of the tweets containing trending keywords follow the same persistent and decaying process as the one in twitter .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ background ]",
    "we provide background information on the development of internet in china and on the sina weibo social network .",
    "in section [ relate ] we survey some related work on trends and spam in social media . in section [ evol ]",
    ", we perform a detailed analysis of trending topics in sina weibo . in section [ future ] , we provide a discussion of our findings .",
    "in this section , we provide some background information on the internet in china , the development of chinese social media services , and sina weibo , the most popular microblog service in china      the development of the internet industry in china over the past decade has been impressive . according to a survey from the china internet network information center ( cnnic ) , by july 2008 , the number of internet users in china has reached 253 million , surpassing the u.s . as the world s",
    "largest internet market @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the number of internet users in china as of 2010 was reported to be 420 million .    despite this",
    ", the fractional internet penetration rate in china is still low .",
    "the 2010 survey by cnnic on the internet development in china @xcite reports that the internet penetration rate in the rural areas of china is on average @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the internet penetration rate in the urban cities of china is on average @xmath1 . in metropolitan cities such as beijing and shanghai",
    ", the internet penetration rate has reached over @xmath2 , with beijing being @xmath3 and shanghai being @xmath4 @xcite .    according to the survey by cnnic in 2010 @xcite ,",

    "et al @xcite , the authors examine spam detection in twitter by first collecting a large dataset of more than 54 million users , 1.9 billion links , and 1.8 billion tweets .",
    "after exploring content and behavoir attributes , they developed an svm classifier and was able to detect spammers with 70% precision and non - spammers with 96% precision .",
    "as an insightful follow up , the authors used @xmath5 statistics to evaluate the importance of the attributes they used in their model .",
    "the second paper with direct application to spam detection in twitter was by wang @xcite .",
    "wang motivated his research with the statistic that an estimated 3% of messages in twitter are spam .",
    "the dataset used in in this study was relatively smaller , gathering information from 25,847 users , 500 thousand tweets , and 49 million follower / friend relationships .",
    "wang used decision trees , neural network , svm , and naive bayesian models .",
    "finally , lee et al .",
    "@xcite described a different approach to detect spammers .",

    ", most topics faded from popularity relatively quickly , while a few topics lasted for long periods of time .",
    "they estimated the average duration of topics to be around 20 - 40 minutes .",
    "when they examined the content of the trends , they observed that traditional notions of influence such as the frequency of posting and the number of followers were not the main drivers of popularity in trends .",
    "rather it was the resonating nature of the content that was important .",
    "an interesting finding was that news topics from traditional media sources such as cnn , new york times and espn was shown to be some of the most popular and long lasting trending topics in twitter , suggesting that twitter amplifies some of the broader trends occurring in society .",

    "the distribution for the number of hours each topic remains on the top 50 trending list follows the power law ( as shown in figure [ power ] a ) .",
    "the distribution suggests that only a few topics exhibit long - term popularity .",
    "[ ht ]     another interesting observation is that a lot of the key words tend to disappear from the top 50 trending list after a certain amount of time and then later reappear .",
    "we examined the distribution for the number of times keywords reappear in the top 50 trending list ( figure [ power ] b ) .",
    "we observe that this distribution follows the power law as well .",
    "both the above observations are very similar to the earlier study of trending topics in twitter by @xcite . however , one important difference with twitter is that the average trending time is significantly higher in sina weibo ( in twitter it was 20 - 40 minutes ) .",
    "this suggests that weibo may not have as many topics competing for attention as twitter .",
    "following our observation that some keywords stay in the top 50 trending list longer than others , we wanted to investigate if topics that are ranked higher initially tend to stay in the top 50 trending list longer .",
    "we separated the top 50 trending keywords into two ranked sets of 25 each : the top 25 and the bottom 25 .",
    "figure [ stay ] illustrates the plot for the percentage of topics that placed in the bottom 25 relating to the number of hours these topics stayed in the top 50 trending list .",
    "we can observe that topics that do not last are usually the ones that are in the bottom 25 . on the other hand ,",
    "the long - trending topics spend most of their time in the top 25 , which suggests that items that become very popular are more likely to stay longer in the top 50 .",
    "this intuitively means that items that attract phenomenal attention initially are not likely to dissipate quickly from people s interests .",
    "[ ht ]       next , we investigate the process of persistence and decay for the trending topics in sina weibo .",
    "in particular , we want to measure the distribution for the time intervals between tweets containing the trending keywords .",
    "we continuously monitored the keywords in the top 50 trending list and for each trending topic we retrieved all the tweets containing the keyword from the time the topic first appeared in the top 50 trending list until the time it disappeared .",
    "accordingly , we collected complete data for 811 topics over the course of 30 days ( from june 20th , 2011 to july 20nd , 2011 ) .",
    "in total we collected 574,382 tweets from 463,231 users . among the 574,382 tweets , 35% of the tweets ( 202,267 tweets ) are original tweets , and 65% of the tweets ( 372,115 tweets ) are retweets .",
    "40.3% of the total users ( 187130 users ) retweeted at least once in our sample .",
    "we measured the number of tweets that each topic gets in 10 minute intervals , from the time the topic starts trending until the time it stops .",
    "from this we can sum up the tweet counts over time to obtain the cumulative number of tweets @xmath9 of topic @xmath10 for any time frame @xmath11 , this is given as : @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the number of tweets on topic @xmath10 in time interval @xmath14 .",
    "we then calculate the ratios @xmath15 for topic @xmath10 for time frames @xmath11 and @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ ratio_general ] shows the distribution of @xmath17 s over all topics for two arbitrarily chosen pairs of time frames : ( 10 , 2 ) and ( 8 , 3 ) ( nevertheless such that @xmath18 , and @xmath11 is relatively large , and @xmath16 is small ) .",
    "[ ht ]     these figures suggest that the ratios @xmath17 are distributed according to the log - normal distributions .",
    "we tested and confirmed that the distributions indeed follow the log - normal distributions .",
    "this finding agrees with the result from a similar experiment in twitter trends .",
    "asur and others @xcite argued that the log - normal distribution occurs due to the multiplicative process involved in the growth of trends which incorporates the decay of novelty as well as the rate of propagation .",
    "the intuitive explanation is that at each time step the number of new tweets ( original tweets or retweets ) on a topic is multiplied over the tweets that we already have .",
    "the number of past tweets , in turn , is a proxy for the number of users that are aware of the topic up to that point .",
    "these users discuss the topic on different forums , including twitter , essentially creating an effective network through which the topic spreads .",
    "as more users talk about a particular topic , many others are likely to learn about it , thus giving the multiplicative nature of the spreading . on the other hand ,",
    "the monotically decreasing decaying process characterizes the decay in timeliness and nove lty of the topic as it slowly becomes obsolete .",
    "however , while only 35% of the tweets in twitter are retweets , there is a much larger percentage of tweets that are retweets in sina weibo .",
    "from our sample we observed that a high 65% of the tweets are retweets .",
    "this implies that the topics are trending mainly because of some content that has been retweeted many times .",
    "thus , sina weibo users are more likely to learn about a particular topic through retweets .      for every new trending keyword we retrieved the most retweeted tweets in the past hour and compiled a list of",
    "most retweeted users .",
    "table [ trend_setter_retweet ] illustrates the top 20 most retweeted authors appearing in at least 10 trending topics each .",
    "the influential authors are ranked according to the ratio between the number of times the authors tweets are retweeted and the number of trending topics these tweets appeared in .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ still ]    we observe that in some cases , accounts with lower user - retweet ratios can still be a spam account .",
    "for example , an account could retweet a number of posts from other spam accounts , thus minimizing the suspicion of being detected as a spam account itself .      from our sample ,",
    "after automatically checking each account , we identified 4985 accounts that were deleted by the sina weibo administrator .",
    "we called these 4985 accounts `` suspected spam accounts '' .",
    "there were 463,231 users in our sample , and 187,130 of them retweeted at least once .",
    "thus we identified 1.08% of the total users ( 2.66% of users that retweeted ) as suspected spam accounts .",
    "next , in order to measure the effect of spam on the weibo network , we removed all retweets from our sample disseminated by suspected spam accounts as well as posts published by them ( and then later retweeted by others ) .",
    "we hypothesize that by removing these retweets , we can eliminate the influences caused by the suspected spam accounts .",
    "we observed that after these posts were removed , we were left with only 189,686 retweets in our sample ( 51% of the original total retweets ) .",
    "in other words , by removing retweets associated wth suspected spam accounts , we * successfully removed 182,429 retweets , which is 49% of the total retweets and 32% of total tweets ( both retweets and original tweets ) from our sample*. this result is very interesting because it shows that a large amount of retweets in our sample are associated with suspected spam accounts .",
    "the spam accounts are therefore artificially inflating the popularity of topics , causing them to trend .",
    "to see the difference after the posts associated with suspected spam accounts were removed , we re - calculated the distribution of user - retweet ratios again for arbitrarily chosen pairs of time frames .",
    "figure [ correct ] illustrates the distribution for time frames ( 10 , 2 ) .",
    "we observed that the distribution is now much smoother and seem to follow the log - normal distribution .",
    "we performed the log - normal test and verified that this is indeed the case .",
    "[ ht ]       we found 6824 users in our sample whose tweets were retweeted .",
    "however , the total number of users who retweeted at least one person s tweet was 187130 , which is very skewed .",
    "figure [ distribution_r ] illustrates the distribution for the number of times users were retweeted .",
    "this distribution follows the power law .",
    "[ ht ]     we discovered that the number of users whose tweets were retweeted by the suspected spam accounts was 4665 , which is a surprising * 68% * of the users who were retweeted in our sample .",
    "this shows that the suspected spam accounts affect a majority of the trend - setters in our sample , helping them raise the retweet number of their posts and thereby making their posts appear on the trending list .",
    "the overall effect of the spammers is very significant .",
    "we also observed that a high 98% of the total trending keywords can be found in posts retweeted by suspected spam accounts .",
    "thus it can also be argued that * many of the trends themselves are artificially generated * , which is a very important result .",
    "next , we investigate the activities of typical spam accounts in sina weibo .",
    "we have shown that accounts with high retweet ratios are likely to be spam accounts . although the majority of the accounts had already been deleted by the administrator , we manually inspected 100 currently existing accounts with high retweet ratios and found that 95 clearly participate in spamming activities .",
    "the other 5 were regular users supporting their favorite singers and celebrities by repeatedly retweeting their posts , which can also be construed as spam ; however , we exclude those from our list of suspected spam accounts .",
    "figure [ example_2 ] illustrates two examples of the activities from suspected spam accounts .    [ ht ]     first , we observe that the suspected spam accounts we inspected tend to repeatedly retweet the same post with the goal of increasing the retweet number of said post .",
    "next , the interval time of these repeated retweets tend to be very close to each other with long breaks between each set .",
    "finally , we observe that the replies left from spam accounts often do not make any sense ( see the comments circled in figure [ example_2 ] ) .",
    "@xcite had similar findings , and explained that this was because the paid posters are mainly interested in finishing the job as quickly as possible , thus they tend to retweet multiple times in short bursts and leave gibberish as replies .",
    "we observe that the replies in [ example_2 ] a ) and b ) are not proper sentences .",
    "for the 4665 users whose tweets were retweeted by at least one suspected spam account , we calculate the percentage of retweets from spam accounts and the percentage of suspected spam accounts involved .",
    "we selected only accounts whose tweets were retweeted by at least 50% of the accounts that are suspected spam accounts . from our manual inspection",
    "we found mainly three types of accounts :    1 .",
    "verified accounts from celebrities and reality show contestants : we hypothesize that they employ spam accounts to boast the popularity of their posts , making it seem like the posts were retweeted by many fans ; 2",
    ".   verified accounts from companies : we hypothesize that they employ spam accounts to boast the perceived popularity of their products ; 3 .",
    "unverified accounts with posts consist of ads for products : we hypothesize that these accounts employ spam accounts to distribute the ads and to boast the perceived popularity of their products , hoping other users will notice and distribute ( see figure [ example_beidong ] for an example ) .",
    "we have examined the tweets relating to the trending topics in sina weibo .",
    "first we analyzed the growth and persistence of trends .",
    "when we looked at the distribution of tweets over time , we observed that there was a significant difference when contrasted with twitter .",
    "the effect of retweets in sina weibo was significantly higher than in twitter .",
    "we also found that many of the accounts that contribute to trends tend to operate as user contributed online magazines , sharing amusing pictures , jokes , stories and antidotes .",
    "such posts tend to recieve a large amount of responses from users and thus retweets .",
    "yang et al .",
    "@xcite have shown similar results about mitbbs users forwarding amusing messages and `` virtual gifts '' to online friends .",
    "the effect of this is similar to that of sending `` a cyber greeting card '' .",
    "this phenomenon can also be observed from text messages sent from cell phones between individuals in china @xcite .",
    "this is interesting in the context of there being strong censorship in chinese social media .",
    "it can be hypothesized that under such circumstances , it is these kind of `` safe '' topics that can emerge .",
    "when we examined the retweets in more detail , we made an important discovery .",
    "we found that 49% of the retweets in sina weibo containing trending keywords were actually associated with fraudulent accounts .",
    "we observed that these accounts comprised of a small amount ( 1.08% of the total users ) of users but were responsible for a large percentage of the total retweets for the trending keywords .",
    "these fake accounts are responsible for artificially inflating certain posts , thus creating fake trends in sina weibo .",
    "we relate our finding to the questions we raised in the introduction .",
    "there is a strong competition among content in online social media to become popular and trend and this gives motivation to users to artificially inflate topics to gain a competitive edge .",
    "we hypothesize that certain accounts in sina weibo employ fake accounts to repeatedly repeat their tweets in order to propel them to the top trending list , thus gaining prominence as top trend setters ( and more visible to other users ) .",
    "we found evidence suggesting that the accounts that do so tend to be verified accounts with commercial purposes .",
    "it is clear that the owners of these user contributed online magazines see this as a business opportunity to gain audience for their content .",
    "they can start by generating and propagating popular content and subsequently begin inserting advertisements amongst the jokes in their their sina weibo accounts .",
    "the artificial inflation makes it an even more effective campaign .",
    "we have found that we can effectively detect suspected spam accounts using retweet ratios .",
    "this can lead to future work such as using machine learning to identify other spamming techniques . in the future",
    ", we would like to examine the behavior of these fake accounts that contribute to artificial inflation in sina weibo to learn how successful they are in influencing trends .",
