    "there are compelling reasons to study a cosmology which is not homogeneous .",
    "inhomogeneous models were studied early on by lematre @xcite and tolman @xcite and by many authors since .",
    "misner @xcite , for example , postulated a chaotic cosmology in which the universe began in a highly irregular state but which becomes regular at late times .",
    "the models presented here possess exactly this property , which will be realized in a later section .",
    "that is , in the matter phase , the deviation from flrw spatial geometry is _ minimal _ and we show this by calculating the gaussian curvature of two spheres in all phases .",
    "the curvature of a two sphere is the same for all values of @xmath0 in the matter domain yielding a three - dimensional space which is isometric to a sphere",
    ". our present location may therefore be anywhere in this universe and there is no conflict with observational cosmology .",
    "the book by krasiski also contains many inhomogeneous models which do not require us to be located at the center of symmetry @xcite .",
    "some more recent studies dealing with inhomogeneous cosmologies include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous cosmological models are not at odds with astrophysical data .",
    "it is well known that inhomogeneities in the early universe will generate anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",
    "such effects have been studied by many groups ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) using density amplitudes and sizes of inhomogeneities corresponding to those of observed current objects ( galactic clusters , the great attractor and voids ) .",
    "these studies , utilizing a range of reasonable parameters , have found that temperature fluctuations in the cmb , @xmath1 , ( @xmath2 being the mean temperature and @xmath3 the deviation from the mean ) amount to no more than about @xmath4 , which is compatible with observation . also , arguments to reconcile inhomogeneous solutions with cosmological observations may be found in @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneity referred to in this paper is a `` radial '' inhomogeneity compatible with spherical symmetry and therefore its effect on the cmb is potentially more difficult to detect than the ( small ) angular deviations .",
    "in general , at very high energies , our knowledge of the state of the universe is highly limited and special assumptions about the matter content and symmetry should be relaxed .",
    "it therefore seems reasonable to investigate solutions which , at least at early times , are less symmetric than the flrw scenarios . a thorough exposition on various inhomogeneous cosmological models",
    "may be found in the book by krasiski @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we consider a cosmology consisting of two fluids , a perfect fluid ( motivated by the successful standard cosmology ) and `` tachyonic '' dust .",
    "we use the term tachyonic due to the association of this source with space - like vectors in the stress - energy tensor .",
    "this terminology is also popular in string - theory motivated cosmologies commenced by the pioneering works of mazumdar , panda , prez - lornezana @xcite and sen @xcite and studied by many others ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that in _ neither _ the case presented here nor the string theory motivated case is the source acausal as will be pointed out below .",
    "the tachyonic dust is chosen as a dark matter candidate for several reasons .",
    "first , it provides one of the simplest extensions to the standard perfect fluid cosmology and it is hoped that this model will provide insight into more complex scenarios .",
    "second , as will be seen below , the tachyonic dust is a source of pressure or tension without energy density and cosmological observations strongly imply that there exists a large pressure or tension component in our universe .",
    "this pressure also affects the overall effective mass of the universe .",
    "multi - fluid models in the context of charged black holes in cosmology have been studied in @xcite    in section [ sec : varlam ] we consider an extension of the model to the case of variable cosmological term .",
    "we discuss in detail how making this term dynamical affects the fate of the universe .",
    "finally , this paper utilizes a number of techniques for analyzing global properties of the manifold and it is hoped that this will provide a useful reference for the mathematical analysis of cosmological models .",
    "we consider here a model of the universe which contains both a perfect fluid and tachyonic dust .",
    "this source possesses the desirable properties mentioned in the introduction .",
    "namely , the dust contribution is a source of pressure as is required for the recent accelerating phase of the universe .",
    "a tachyonic dust is the simplest model which contributes to pressure and it will be shown that this pressure also makes a contribution to the mass of the universe .",
    "this field is therefore also a potentially interesting candidate for dark matter .    aside from spherical symmetry",
    ", the sole assumption is that the eigenvalues of stress - energy tensor be real .",
    "we may therefore write @xmath5u^{\\mu}u_{\\nu}+{p(t ,   r)}\\delta^{\\mu}_{\\;\\nu}+ { \\alpha(t ,   r)}w^{\\mu}w_{\\nu } , \\label{eq : stresstens}\\ ] ] with @xmath6 here @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the fluid energy density , fluid pressure , and tachyonic _ pressure _ ( or tension ) respectively . by comparison of the @xmath9 term in ( [ eq : stresstens ] ) to the stress - energy tensor of regular dust , it can be seen why we choose the term `` tachyonic dust '' to describe this source .",
    "notice that a dust associated with a space - like vector possesses the desirable property in that it yields solely a pressure .",
    "it will be shown that this tension may produce the observed acceleration of the universe at late times @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the source is _ not _ acausal as the algebraic structure of ( [ eq : stresstens ] ) is exactly similar to that of an anisotropic fluid which is a causal source under minor restrictions and is often used in general relativity ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the time coordinate , @xmath10 , may be chosen to be coincident with the proper time along a fluid streamline ( the comoving condition ) .",
    "this gauge , along with spherical symmetry , allows a special class of metrics to be written as    @xmath11 , \\label{eq : submetric } \\\\",
