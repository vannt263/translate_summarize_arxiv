    "at the lagrangian level , qcd has , in addition to @xmath3 chiral symmetry , an approximate @xmath2 symmetry , under which all left - handed quark fields are rotated by a common phase while the right - handed quark fields are rotated by an opposite phase .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath2 symmetry is violated by the axial anomaly present at the quantum level and thus can not give rise to the goldstone boson which would occur when @xmath4 chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the @xmath2 particle , known as @xmath5 in the @xmath6 case , acquires an additional mass through the quantum tunneling effects mediated by instantons @xcite , breaking up the mass degeneracy with pions and @xmath0 in the chiral limit when all quarks ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) are massless .",
    "the @xmath10 particle also acquires an additional mass through the mixing with @xmath11 .",
    "it is believed that at high temperatures the instanton effects are suppressed due to the debye - type screening @xcite .",
    "then one expects a practical restoration of @xmath2 at high temperatures .",
    "if the restoration occurs at a temperature lower than the chiral phase transition temperature @xmath12 , there may be some interesting phenomenological implications in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , as suggested first by pisarski and wilczek @xcite and more recently by shuryak @xcite .",
    "one of the consequences of @xmath2 restoration is the enhancement of @xmath0 particle production at small and intermediate transverse momenta due to the softening of its mass at high temperatures .",
    "however , the final yield of the @xmath0 particles and their @xmath13 distributions both depend crucially on the chemical and thermal equilibrating processes involving the @xmath0 .    in this paper , we shall examine the rates of various processes relevant for the thermal @xmath0 particle production , in particular , whether or not the @xmath0 can decouple early enough from the thermal system expected to be produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we shall present a theoretical calculation of the thermal cross sections for the processes @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , essential to the thermal and chemical equilibration .",
    "our calculations are based on models which explicitly incorporate the @xmath2 anomaly .",
    "we also assume an exponential suppression of the @xmath2 anomaly due to the debye - type screening of the instanton effect @xcite , which leads to the temperature dependence of the @xmath0 and @xmath11 masses .",
    "our results suggest that the chemical equilibrium breaks up for @xmath0 particles long before the thermal freeze - out .",
    "we suggest a modest enhancement of thermal @xmath0 production as a signal for the relic of @xmath2 restoration .",

    "one has to rely on theoretical models to calculate the interaction rates which are complicated by many uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless , the scattering amplitudes at low energy can be more or less precisely predicted if the meson masses are soft , thanks to the soft - meson theorems which are based on the symmetry of the interactions and depend very little on the detailed dynamics .",
    "the current - algebra predictions of these scattering amplitudes have been made very early by osborn @xcite based on @xmath19 , where the anomalous @xmath2 and the @xmath0 and @xmath11 mixing are not included . in the light of softening of @xmath0 and @xmath11 masses at high temperatures",

    "therefore , the kaon mass @xmath182 is large and the @xmath11 does not become very soft . at @xmath134 , the @xmath11",
    "mass @xmath56 is about 750 mev . even without the effect of chiral symmetry breaking",
    ", the large strange - quark mass can give rise to a large mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath11 according to eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "this mixing gives @xmath11 a mass @xmath183 even if @xmath2 is completely restored .",
    "this mass is significantly larger than the @xmath0 mass at any temperature .",
    "therefore , in the context of our model , the @xmath11 effects are only moderate .",
    "the ratio @xmath180 should never exceed that of @xmath177 .",
    "so far we have confined ourselves to the possible suppression of the instanton effects at finite temperature that causes the softening of the masses arising from the topological charge transitions . at very high temperatures",
    ", it is known that such transitions can occur without going through the instanton configurations .",
    "in fact , they are dominated by sphaleron - like transitions whose electroweak counterparts have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is pointed out by mclerran , mottola and shaposhnikov @xcite that the rate of a qcd sphaleron transition should be estimated in analogy to the electroweak theory for temperatures above the symmetry - restoration , which may not be quite suppressed . in the range of temperatures discussed in this paper ,",
    "the rate of the qcd sphaleron transition may be unimportant . a rough estimate by giudice and shaposhnikov @xcite is @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the strength of the transition .",
    "the characteristic time scale of the sphaleron transition is @xmath186 there is some evidence for @xmath185 to be @xmath187 from lattice calculations @xcite . unless @xmath185 is really big , greater than 10 , the sphalerons should be decoupled from the system in the hadronic phase , where the instanton effect is most dominant .",
