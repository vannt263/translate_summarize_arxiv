    "<S> therefore , either the nernst signal is not due to superconducting phase fluctuations , or that vortices in underdoped have highly unconventional properties .    over the past decade </S>",

    "<S> the nernst signal @xmath0 , defined by the ratio between a measured electric field @xmath1 and a transverse applied temperature gradient @xmath2 in an electrically isolated system subjected to an external magnetic field @xmath3 , is typically very small in nonmagnetic normal metals . </S>",

    "<S> however , others have attributed the large nernst signal to the response of quasiparticles in a symmetry - broken state competing with superconductivity . @xcite    despite its appealing nature , the vortex based picture has not been previously justified by an analytical treatment . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , they devised a simulation method to calculate the thermoelectric response based on vortex dynamics.@xcite    in this letter we aim to bridge the aforementioned theoretical gap and present an analytical study of diamagnetism and transport in an extreme type - ii superconducting film that is formulated directly in terms of vortices . </S>",
