    "if minima do exist , the particles arrive there and stop . in the presence of noise , the particles do not stay permanently in the minima but will undergo noise activated escape events .",

    "depending on the statistical properties of the potential , the long - time limit of the process can be quite different from that in a washboard potential @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the heterogeneity of the substrate potential may lead to anomalous dynamics @xcite .",
    "in particular , over a range of forces around the stall force subdiffusion is observed @xcite , i.e. the displacement grows as @xmath5 , with @xmath6 .",
