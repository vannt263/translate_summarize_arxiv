    "the electronic structure of defects in mgo has been the subject of a number of theoretical studies . among the latest first - principles calculations",
    ", one should mention the study on anion vacancies by the muffin - tin green s function method@xcite and in a mixed - basis pseudopotential supercell calculation@xcite . in ref.@xcite , the electronic structure of fe , co , and ni",
    "impurities in mgo has been calculated making use of the greens - function method within the linearized - muffin - tin - orbitals ( lmto )  atomic - spheres - approximation ( asa ) formalism . in this paper ,",
    "the energy positions of the impurity @xmath3 levels in the gap have been calculated for several charge states of the impurity ions .",
    "however , the effects of lattice relaxations around cation impurity atoms have been ignored ( although the uniform relaxation around vacancies and substitutional hydrogen has been considered in ref.@xcite ) , and the main emphasis has been on the peculiarities of the electronic structure in these defect systems .",
    "the present study is motivated by the fact that fe impurity ( as well as many other 3@xmath4 ions ) in mgo is a jahn  teller system , as has been observed in electron spin resonance experiments ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and @xcite ) . however , the microscopic pattern of the underlying jahn  teller distortion is not clear from the experiment , nor did the _ ab initio _",
    "calculations performed up to now succeed in incorporating the essential effects of the interaction between orbital moment of the impurity ion and the displacements of ligand atoms . based on an _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculation scheme with no shape approximation for the potential",
    ", we attempted to study the effect of symmetry - lowering atomic displacements on the total energy and thus to optimize the positions of ligand atoms towards their relaxed local configuration around the impurity . in doing this",
    ", we realized the importance of going beyond the local density approximation ( lda ) in describing the electronic states at the impurity site .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we briefly specify the calculation scheme we used . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lda ] , the results of a conventional calculation for the fe : mgo system within the local - density approximation are outlined . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lda+u ] , we describe the effect of introducing the orbital - dependent potential within the so - called lda+u approximation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : geomet ] , the lattice relaxation around fe in mgo is analyzed , basing on total - energy calculations for various geometries . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fe3 + ] , we present a simplified way to model a metastable fe@xmath2 ion configuration of the impurity in mgo and analyze the electronic structure corresponding to this configuration .",
    "we performed the calculations for the 2@xmath52@xmath52 supercell of mgo ( 16 atoms ) , with one mg atom substituted by fe , making use of the full - potential lmto method@xcite .",
    "the space is divided into nonoverlapping muffin - tin spheres , the radii of which were chosen to be 1.65 a.u . for mg ( or fe ) and 2.13 a.u . for o. mg  2@xmath6 and fe  3@xmath6 states",
    "were treated as semicore , and all higher - lying states included in the valence band panel . following the usual routine of geometry - optimizing full - potential calculations , we calculated the equilibrium lattice constant of the undistorted nacl - type crystal lattice of perfect mgo , which was found to be 98% of the experimental value 4.21  . the band structure calculated for perfect mgo",
    "was found to be in agreement with earlier calculations@xcite .",
    "the valence band is formed mainly by o  2@xmath6 states and the conduction band by mg  3@xmath6 states , with the gap separating them equal to 0.43 ry ( 5.85 ev ) .",
    "this value is somewhat bigger than in some other calculations , e.g. 4.36 ev@xcite , 4.65 ev@xcite , 4.98 ev@xcite , but well below the experimental estimate of about 7.8 ev@xcite , which is a typical error in calculating the band gap value within the lda .",
    "the brillouin zone integration in the course of iterations was performed over a mesh of special points ; total - energy convergency over the * k * points has been achieved at 10 special points for the main valence band panel in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone for tetragonal symmetry ( most of the calculations have been performed in tetragonal symmetry for the reasons discussed below )",
    ". densities of states were calculated by the tetrahedron method with 75 * k * points in the irreducible part .",
    "fe impurities which substitute 1/8 of mg atoms in the supercell give rise to narrow levels in the gap above the mostly o  2@xmath6-type valence band . in conventional lda calculations ,",
    "the potential acting on all @xmath4 electrons of the same spin at fe site is identical , and splitting of the impurity levels may occur due to spin polarization or the crystal field effect .",
    "the interaction between nearest fe atoms , which are separated only by one mg atom in the [ 110 ] direction , gives rise to the formation of narrow @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands split by the crystal field by @xmath90.1 ry .",
    "the lower - lying @xmath7 states become fully occupied by 3 spin - up and 3 spin - down electrons , and the fe impurity is stripped of its 4@xmath10 electrons , thus being left in the @xmath11 atomic configuration with ionicity 2 + .",
    "the fermi level falls , therefore , in the gap between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands .",
    "the density of states obtained by the full - potential lmto calculation , in the option which incorporated spin - resolved potential and charge density within the fe mt sphere , but in fact resulted in a zero spin moment , is shown in fig .",
    "[ dos_lda ] .",
    "a nonmagnetic configuration occurs quite seldom for fe impurities , and in the present case the calculated result clearly contradicts the experimental observation that the ground state configuration of fe in mgo is @xmath12 ( 2@xmath8 , 4@xmath7 )  see the discussion in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore we were careful in additionally investigating the question of whether the obtained non - magnetic configuration of fe is a drawback of lda , or an artifact due to some particular cell geometry , choice of sphere radii , etc . in a series of calculations by the tight - binding ( tb ) lmto method@xcite",
    "it was proven that the first assumption is correct , since convergence to the same nonmagnetic configuration occured irrespective of the cell size ( as big as a 32-atom supercell of mgo : fe has been tested ) , presence of empty spheres , and other starting conditions . the ( 0@xmath8 , 6@xmath7 ) configuration turned out to be very stable , as any attempt to remove electrons from @xmath7 states to @xmath8 states energetically quite separated from them led to the situation when the fermi level crosses two narrow peaks ( spin - down @xmath7 and spin - up @xmath8 ) and is therefore energetically very unfavorable .",
    "the converged density of states determined for the 32-atom supercell by the tb - lmto method was almost identical to that shown in fig .",
    "[ dos_lda ] , with the same position of @xmath7 and @xmath8 impurity peaks in the energy gap , only that the widths of these peaks have been substantially reduced .",
    "we considered this similarity as an indication that our results from a full - potential calculation in regard to the structure optimization may be probably only slightly corrected by further increase of the supercell size .",
    "an obvious drawback of conventional lda calculations performed for potentially magnetic impurities in insulators is the implicit orbital degeneracy within the @xmath4 shell . in reality",
    ", one would expect that the potential acting on any particular electronic state depends on whether this state is occupied or empty .",
    "being effectively of just marginal effect for strongly hybridized systems , this discrepancy becomes quite important as the degree of localization increases .",
    "this is exactly the case in the mgo : fe system , and we discuss below how the results could be amended by lifting the orbital degeneracy .",
    "in a simple way , the orbital- ( and occupation- ) dependent potential is introduced in the so - called lda+@xmath0 approach@xcite . the correction to the potential enters as a constant term , determined primarily by the screened effective coulomb integral @xmath0 and the screened exchange parameter @xmath13 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the first parameter for the system in question has been estimated from self - consistent full - potential calculation within the lda using the scheme of gunnarsson _",
    "et al._@xcite to be @xmath0=0.489 ry .",
    "the value of @xmath13 for fe in mgo is expected to be the same as in feo and was taken from anisimov _ et al._@xcite .    in an earlier application@xcite",
    ", the lda+@xmath0 method has been applied to a number of oxide systems , making it possible to obtain reasonable _ ab initio _ estimations of the band gap value and magnetic moments that were otherwise not possible within the lda . when applying this scheme to mgo",
    ", however , it was not possible to correct the underestimated value of the band gap in a similar way , because of rather weak localization of the mg  3@xmath6 states forming the conduction band . therefore , the effect of lda+@xmath0 was confined in our case only to the fe impurity , for which the conventional lda approach predicts an essentially incorrect charge configuration .",
    "on introducing the occupation - dependent potential acting on each fe  3@xmath4 orbital independently as is described above , the energy positions of the impurity levels in the gap were drastically changed ( fig .",
    "[ dos_lda+u ] ) . as the filled and empty states of @xmath7 symmetry",
    "are no longer forced to reside at the same energy position , as was the case in the lda calculation , the system finds its way in the course of iterations to a more stable configuration where the fermi level falls in the gap between filled ( @xmath14 ) and empty ( @xmath15,@xmath16 ) states of @xmath7 symmetry and thus the hund s rule is satisfied .",
    "majority - spin @xmath8 states are then completely filled , in contrast to what was predicted by the lda calculation , and the atomic configuration becomes ( 2@xmath8 , 4@xmath7 ) .",
    "it was essential to perform the brillouin zone integration over at least 1/16 , i.e. over the irreducible wedge corresponding to the tetragonal structure , and not over 1/48 as for cubic symmetry , in order to account for the difference which appears now between @xmath14 and ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) states which are differently occupied .",
    "this does not mean that we force the system to split the @xmath4 state in this particular way .",
    "the use of the appropriate symmetry is just a means to save effort in the integration over the whole brillouin zone , which would give the same scheme of splitting for the @xmath4 states .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ dos_lda+u ] that the degeneracy pattern of fe  3@xmath4 levels in the ligand field of nominally cubic symmetry looks like that corresponding to a tetragonal crystal field , because of the symmetry - lowering effect of filled @xmath14 states . as is known , @xmath7 states should split into @xmath17 and @xmath8 , and this is consistent with the remaining degeneracy of @xmath15 and @xmath16 states .",
    "then , @xmath8 should split into @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which is seen as the lifted degeneracy between ( 3@xmath20 ) and ( @xmath21 ) states ; however , they both are either filled ( for majority spin ) or empty ( for minority spin ) and therefore are acted on by the same @xmath0-dependent correction to the potential",
    ".    the tetragonal - symmetry electrostatic field at the fe site may affect the relaxation of the ligand atoms around the impurity .",
    "in addition to the totally symmetric uniform relaxation which was studied , e.g. , around vacancies in ref.@xcite , we should now consider the effect of symmetry - lowering tetragonal displacements of oxygen atoms .",
    "the results of corresponding total - energy calculations are discussed below .",
    "not much is known about the structural microscopic configuration of atoms in the mgo crystal around the fe impurity , apart from the mere fact that this system exhibits dynamic jahn  teller behavior .",
    "the origin of the jahn  teller displacement seems to be essentially the tetragonal electrostatic field related to the ground - state configuration of the fe@xmath1 ion as discussed above , and the dynamical character reveals merely an exchange between three equivalent directions of the tetragonal axis in the initially cubic crystal .",
    "it may be expected that the strongest effect on the total energy will be from the totally symmetric uniform adjustment of ligand shells as the mg@xmath1 ion is substituted by fe@xmath1 . on top of this uniform relaxation , the jahn",
    " teller effect is expected to emerge in the form of symmetry lowering due to additional displacements of ligand atoms consistent with the tetragonal symmetry . in order to reduce the computational effort for examining the effect of various independent atomic displacements on the total energy",
    ", we restricted ourselves to considering the displacement of the nearest oxygen atoms only .",
    "that means that we considered only uniform breathing of the o@xmath22 octahedron and the additional axial displacement of its two apical atoms .    the total energy as a function of uniform o@xmath22 breathing is shown in fig .",
    "open circles mark the energy values obtained in the lda+@xmath0 calculation , and closed triangles the results from the conventional lda calculation , with nonmagnetic configuration of the fe@xmath1 ion .",
    "the latter values correspond to other absolute values of the total energy , but the plot is shifted so as to coincide with the lda+@xmath0 curve for zero breathing , for better comparison .",
    "one can see that the outward expansion of the octahedron by @xmath91% of the lattice constant ( 1.15% in the lda+@xmath0 calculation ) is obtained in the calculation in both cases , so it is mostly a purely electrostatic effect , related to the different electronegativity of fe and mg . however , the magnitude of the energy lowering is substantially larger in the lda+@xmath0 calculation .",
    "subsequent squeezing of the o@xmath22 octahedron along [ 001 ] by 0.5% of the lattice constant lead to further decrease of the total energy .",
    "the corresponding densities of states ( dos s ) obtained in the lda+@xmath0 calculation are presented in fig .",
    "[ dos_lda+u ] .",
    "although substitutional fe in mgo exists mostly as a 2 + ion , the fe@xmath2 configuration is also known to exist , at least as a metastable state .",
    "it was pointed out by schultheiss@xcite that upon irradiation with x rays or electrons , fe@xmath2 ions are formed due to the trapping of holes at fe@xmath1 sites .",
    "since the origin of the holes to be trapped is most probably related to the lack of mg atoms , an adequate modeling of such a defect should in principle incorporate this effect somehow in the construction of the supercell . in a simplified attempt to get some insight into the rearrangement of electronic states at the fe site due to the absorption of an extra hole",
    ", we performed a self - consistent lda+@xmath0 calculation with the option that the fermi level was searched for at one electron less per supercell than should exist from the electroneutrality condition .",
    "this means physically that an electron is removed from the fe site ( since the band just below the fermi level is of essentially fe  3@xmath4 character ) , and no charge compensation is nominally introduced . if we consider then the possible effect of restoring the charge neutrality in the simplest form , i.e. , due to the introduction of compensatory charge uniformly distributed over the crystal , it will obviously lead merely to a slight rigid shift of all bands which have been calculated as described above",
    ". therefore this simplified approach will be probably of no use for the study of relaxation where the spatial distribution of the compensating charge is really important , but it is expected to provide an adequate description of electronic states at the impurity site .    the resulting dos is shown in fig .",
    "[ dos_3 + ] .",
    "it is rather different from the dos of the fe@xmath1 ion , and the origin of this difference is that as the minority - spin @xmath14 state , i.e. , the highest occupied one , is stripped of its electron , it becomes equivalent , with respect to the potential acting on them , to @xmath15 and @xmath16 states , and the threefold degeneracy of the @xmath7 state is restored in the course of iterations , even as we solved the band structure problem in nominally tetragonal symmetry . at the same time",
    "( as the half - filled @xmath4 shell possesses full cubic symmetry ) , the twofold degeneracy of @xmath23 and @xmath21 states is restored .",
    "larger exchange splitting , corresponding now to almost 5@xmath24 , shifts fe majority - spin states down within the valence band region , and crystal - field - split minority - spin states are situated now at @xmath90.2 ry and @xmath90.3 ry above the fermi level .",
    "in the course of studying the electronic structure of fe in mgo from first principles , we have found that an electronic - structure calculation within the conventional lda erroneously predicts the ground - state configuration of fe in mgo to be nonmagnetic , with the ( 0@xmath8 , 6@xmath7 ) configuration . in order to amend this drawback and to go beyond the lda ,",
    "an occupation - dependent correction to the potentials of different impurity states has been implemented in the lda+@xmath0 scheme .",
    "the resulting electronic configuration of the fe@xmath1 ion was found to be consistent with the hund s rule , and the lifting of the orbital degeneracy between occupied and empty @xmath4 states resulted in a local field of tetragonal symmetry at the impurity site .",
    "this symmetry - lowering affects the relaxation of the ligand atom around the impurity , making it a combination of a 1.15% ( in units of the lattice constant ) totally symmetric outward expansion of the o@xmath22 octahedron and a 0.5% inward squeezing of two apical oxygen atoms . for the fe@xmath2 ionic configuration of the impurity",
    ", the orbital splitting only persists between @xmath7 and @xmath8 states of the @xmath25 shell , and the local cubic symmetry is retained .    financial support of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft is gratefully acknowledged .",
