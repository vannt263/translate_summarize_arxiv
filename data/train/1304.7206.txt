    "one of the most challenging research questions in neuroscience is understanding the relationship between spatially - structured cortical states and the underlying neural circuitry that supports them .",

    "frequently - used firing rate functions @xmath4 include the heaviside step function , piecewise - linear functions or smooth sigmoidal functions .",

    "unlike spiking neural network models , continuous field models have the advantage that analytic techniques for partial differential equations ( pdes ) can be adapted to study the formation of patterns and their dependence upon control parameters .",
    "various types of coherent structures have been observed in neural field models , ranging from spatially and temporally periodic patterns to travelling waves and spiral waves  @xcite .",
    "neural field equations have also successfully been used to model a wide range of neurobiological phenomena such as visual hallucinations @xcite , mechanisms for short term memory @xcite and feature selectivity in the visual cortex @xcite .    a common strategy to derive analytical and numerical results for the nonlocal  eq .

    "previous studies in 2d have relied exclusively on pde approximations of the connectivity functions ; here we demonstrated that these approximations can give a very close agreement with the full integral model if a sufficiently high - order approximation is taken .",
    "the numerical schemes presented here will allow for future studies of the neural field equations to use connectivity functions defined either directly in the real domain or the fourier domain without recourse to pde methods , provided that the sigmoidal firing rate be smooth and that the integral formulation can be expressed as a convolution ( this extends also to inhomogeneous firing rates ) .",
    "the neural field studied in the present paper can be considered as a model of the visual cortex and the localised patterns studied without inputs can be related to visual hallucinations that can be localised in the visual field  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the localised states computed in our bifurcation analysis are exactly the types of solutions selected by the model in the presence of weak inputs .",
    "the persistence of these localised structures in the presence of a model input is new .",
    "this future direction will be of particular interest for the study of localised patterns of activity that have been observed in the primary visual cortex  @xcite with localised visual input .",
