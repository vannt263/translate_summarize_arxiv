    "freely suspended atomically thin metallic wires are the ultimate one - dimensional conductors .",
    "since their discovery@xcite , scientists have been amazed by the mere existence of these wires , since at first one would not expect such one - dimensional structures to be able to physically exist : the capillary instability that is also observed when droplets break off a forming water column would destroy the one - dimensionality since the surface tension is not strong enough to keep the structure together .",
    "in fact atomic wires are only observed when they are suspended between metal electrodes at both sides or supported by a substrate onto which they can be artificially be created atom by atoms @xcite or formed by self - assembly @xcite .",
    "once the wire breaks due to a critical built - up of stress in the chain , the atoms collapse back to the electrode since the necessary wire tension that kept the structure together has disappeared .",
    "atomic wires have actually only been observed for the three 5d transition metals au , pt and ir in break - junction experiments at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "although there has been an indication for the formation of short silver chains in tem experiments at room temperature in uhv @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the physical mechanism that drives atomic chain formation is similar to what drives spontaneous surface reconstructions in these same metals , a delicate balance between the s and d electron density of states influenced by relativistic effects @xcite . due to the high charge of the nucleus",
    "the lowest s - electron orbitals become relativistically contracted , which causes a lowering of the fermi energy resulting in a small depletion of the anti - bonding states in the d - band . in the case of the 5d transition metals",
    "this relativistic effect is large enough to tip the energy balance for the formation of surface reconstructions and the formation of atomic chains .",
    "this is not the case for 4d and 3d transition metals @xcite . indeed",
    "a ag(110 ) surface does form a missing row reconstruction while au(110 ) does .",
    "experimentally freely suspended atomic wires can be created by means of the mechanically controlled break junction ( mcbj ) technique @xcite , which is employed in this work . with this technique",
    "a small junction can be mechanically broken and be brought into contact again .",
    "alternative approaches involve the use of a stm , the tip of which can be contacted with a surface @xcite or by creating holes in a thin metallic foil by electron bombardment until a single strand of gold atoms is left , which can be imaged by tem . @xcite .",
    "the mcbj technique and the electron bombardment technique have shown a large discrepancy in the observed interatomic distances between the atoms in the chain . for a gold chain created by the mcbj technique in cryogenic vacuum an interatomic distance of 2.5 @xmath0 0.2 ",
    "is observed @xcite while room temperature tem images give distances up to 4   @xcite .",
    "based on model calculations , it has been suggested that these large interatomic distances are due to the incorporation of foreign atoms like oxygen @xcite , hydrogen @xcite , carbon or nitrogen @xcite that are not resolved by tem .",
    "especially oxygen is an interesting candidate since density functional theory ( dft ) calculations have shown that the total energy of a gold atomic chain with atomic oxygen incorporated is lowered compared to clean gold @xcite and the au - o bond is able to sustain higher pulling forces before breaking @xcite .",
    "we have previously given experimental evidence showing that oxygen can indeed be incorporated into atomic gold chains and that oxygen induces chain formation for silver , which is known not to form chains in pure form @xcite .",
    "in this article we will provide further evidence for oxygen incorporation by demonstrating the presence of oxygen in the chain by local vibration - mode spectroscopy and by calculations on the conductance properties of the chains , which strongly support our experimental observations .",
    "in our experiments we used poly - crystalline au , ag and cu wires with a diameter of 100 @xmath1 and a purity of 99.999 @xmath2 . after creating a circular notch in the middle of the wire ,",
    "it is fixed on a bendable substrate in a three point bending configuration . by using a mechanical axle",
    "the wire can be broken and with a piezoelectric element it is possible to control the distance between the two electrodes with atomic precision .",
    "a detailed description of the mbcj technique can be found in ref  .",
    "our experiments were performed in cryogenic vacuum .",
    "once the sample chamber is evacuated and cooled down to 5  k the wire is broken for the first time ensuring clean fracture surfaces .",
    "close to the junction a local heater and thermometer are mounted , which enable us to control the temperature of the junction between 5 and 60  k , while the vacuum can remains at 5  k. in order to be able to admit oxygen to the junction the insert is equipped with a capillary attached to a high purity oxygen reservoir . to prevent premature condensation of oxygen ,",
    "the capillary has a heating wire running all along the interior . to prevent other molecules to enter into the sample chamber while admitting oxygen through the heated capillary , it is pumped and baked out by means of the heating wire at 150  @xmath3c , prior to the cool down .",
    "two point conductance measurements are performed to determine the conductance of the atomic wires .",
    "differential conductance ( di / dv ) measurements were performed on the atomic wires using a lock - in amplifier .",
    "the bias voltage was modulated with a fixed modulation amplitude of 1 mv and a frequency of 7 khz , while sweeping the dc bias voltage from + 100 mv to - 100 mv and back .",
    "microscopic junctions of gold , silver and copper are carefully broken and the conductance is observed to decrease stepwise until finally the contact has a cross section equal to the diameter of only a single atom . for the noble metals",
    "the conductance of single - atom contacts is close to one quantum unit of conductance , g@xmath4 = 2e@xmath5/h . for gold",
    "it is known that upon stretching a single atom contact , additional atoms can be pulled out of the electrodes to form a monatomic chain of up to 7 atoms long @xcite .",
    "this manifests itself in long plateaus with conductances around 1 g@xmath4 that are observed while monitoring the conductance of gold contacts as they are pulled apart .",

    "this is in contrast to what is seen in the case of the non - chain - forming metals silver and copper .",
    "the conductance of the last plateau drops sharply towards 0.1 g@xmath4 and 0.2 g@xmath4 for silver and copper , respectively , and the average total length increases dramatically .",
    "only when the temperature of the gold sample is increased to about 40 k the average chain length also increases .",
    "one way to obtain more quantitative information about the conductance of the atomic contacts and chains is to record conductance histograms . by recording all conductances that are measured when",

    "[ fig2 ] conductance histograms for the three noble metals are shown with and without oxygen admitted . in order to focus on the changes that occur due to the admission of oxygen the histograms have been normalized to the area under the curves .",
    "for the clean metals one can clearly see that a peak near 1 g@xmath4 is dominant over all other conductances .",
    "when oxygen is introduced the dominant peak at 1 g@xmath4 decreases sharply for silver and copper due to a shift of weight to lower conductance values . for gold at 5",
    "k no significant changes are seen as was discussed above .",
    "these observations indicate that oxygen influences the atomic contacts of silver and copper in such a way that configurations with conductances near 1 g@xmath4 are less frequently obtained .",
    "the conductance of atomic contacts for gold is apparently hardly influenced by oxygen since the conductance histograms of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are nearly identical .",
    "recently we have presented evidence @xcite that au atomic wires become reinforced and therefore can be stretched to longer lengths as a result of their reaction with oxygen at 40 k. furthermore , we have shown that this bond strengthening effect is even more pronounced for silver wires . we have studied the chain formation process under the influence of oxygen for the three noble metals .",
    "since the conductance of an atomic chain or single - atom contact of noble metals are known to be close to 1 g@xmath4 we can measure the lengths of a large ensemble of conductance plateaus near 1 g@xmath6 and construct a length histogram . in such histogram",
    "the lengths of the plateaus are plotted against the number of times those lengths were observed .",

    "[ fig2 ] that in the case of silver and copper with oxygen admitted a large portion of the observed conductances have values below 1 g@xmath4 .",
    "we suspect that these low conductance values belong to silver and copper atomic wires that are influenced by oxygen and therefore we have included these conductances in the chain length measurements .",
    "the length of the chains is obtained by measuring the distance , which the electrodes move apart from the moment when the conductance of the contact drops below 1.1 g@xmath4 until it drops below 0.05 g@xmath4 . in the case of gold",

    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) the length histograms for the three clean noble metals and those with oxygen admitted are shown .",

    "a bond length of only 1.2   is not expected and is about 60@xmath2 smaller than for the gold - oxygen chains ( see fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] is located at the same position as the dominant peak in the clean silver histogram .",

    "here we have introduced the notation @xmath8 and @xmath9 that indicate the connections to the left and right electrodes , respectively .",
    "we will take a more detailed look at the peak positions that arise in the length histograms of fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , in order to explain the discrepancy .",
    "a length count is taken at the moment an atomic chain breaks and the atoms collapse back to the electrodes , which causes the the conductance of the junction to drop deep into the tunneling regime .",
    "a rupture can occur when one of the linear one - dimensional bonds can not be stretched any further due to a critical built - up of energy in the chain .",
    "but sometimes it is possible that an additional atom , which is weakly bound to the bulk atoms at one of the electrode apexes , is pulled into the atomic chain .",
    "consequently , the chain remains intact and the tension of the linear bonds is relaxed .",
    "then it is possible to stretch the one - dimensional structure further until again a critical built - up of energy occurs , which can result into rupture or the elongation of the chain with yet another atom .",
    "this sequence repeats itself over and over again and the incorporation of atoms will stop when the supply of loosely bound atoms at the apexes of the electrodes is depleted .",
    "the peaks in the length histograms indicate lengths at which there is a higher preference for the atomic chain to break and therefore represent atomic chain lengths in a stretched configuration .    in table  [ table ]",
    "all peak positions together with an interpretation in terms of the corresponding chain composition are listed . from the length histogram of clean silver in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we obtain a silver - silver bond length of 2.4 and in order to simplify the analysis we kept this value fixed .",
    "furthermore we assume that the bond length at the edges where the atomic chain is contacted to the electrodes with either a silver ( @xmath8ag ) or an oxygen atom ( @xmath8o ) is the same . from this simple analysis",
    "we arrive at a silver - oxygen bond length of 1.8 @xmath0 0.1  , very close to the theoretical value @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis can be made for the peak positions of the copper - oxygen length histogram of fig .",
    "[ fig3](e ) , which yields a copper - oxygen bond of 1.7 @xmath0 0.1  .",
    "the decrease of the conductance of the chains as the chains become longer is very nicely seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) . while for silver - oxygen and copper - oxygen chains the drop in conductance starts already for relatively short chains , gold - oxygen chains display a lower conductance only when they are on average longer than about 16  , corresponding to a chain with a length of more than six gold atoms .    .",

    "[ fig5 ] shows the average return length for gold - oxygen , silver - oxygen and copper - oxygen chains . in all cases",
    "an offset is observed followed by an increase in average return length as a function of chain length .",
    "the offset indicates that even for a single atom contact that breaks before forming a chain the electrodes move back a certain distance .",
    "this is due to the fact that the single atom connects the two electrodes and it can sustain a force upon pulling on it .",
    "this causes a counter - force pulling on the electrodes , which will slightly elastically deform them .",
    "when the contact breaks the stress can be released and the atoms relax and move back into their equilibrium position .",
    "but when longer chains are being formed and eventually broken the atoms that made up the chain collapse back to the electrodes and consequently the electrodes have to move back a longer distance upon increasing chain length .",
    "given the fact that the average return length increases more or less linearly with chain length we have a strong indication that atomic chains of noble metal atoms with oxygen are indeed being formed .",
    "the deviation from a purely linear increase can be the result of a larger energy stored in the longer chains , because more metal oxygen bonds are present that can sustain higher pulling forces .",
    "when such long chains break the stored elastic energy may propel atoms away from the junction area .",
    "the force a silver - oxygen bond in an infinite alternating silver - oxygen chain can sustain is about 2.4 times larger than for a silver - silver bond in a infinite silver chain @xcite . while the difference in the case of pure gold and gold - oxygen is about a factor 1.5 @xcite explaining why this effect is not appearing so clearly in gold - oxygen return lengths .",
    "in the previous section we have provided evidence that oxygen can chemically react with noble metal contacts or chains and reinforce the linear bonds in the wires so that they can be elongated further . in this section",

    "this technique forms a powerful tool for studying the interactions of electrons with vibrational excitations in a metallic contact @xcite .",
    "an atomic chain of noble metal atoms is a ballistic conductor for low bias voltages , since it has one nearly completely transparent conductance channel resulting in a total conductance very close to 1 g@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , electrons with sufficient energy have a small probability to excite phonon modes in an atomic chain and by means of differential conductance ( di / dv ) spectroscopy the energies for those modes can be determined as was shown for clean gold atomic wires @xcite .",
    "about 1  @xmath2 of all forward traveling electrons with an excess energy larger than the energy of a phonon mode actually do excite such mode . those electrons lose energy , which forces them to scatter back since all forward moving states below e@xmath12 + ev@xmath13 are already occupied for a perfect single - channel conductor .",
    "this backscattering causes a small decrease of the total conductance of the atomic chain .",

    "however , our experiments show , that finite ag - o chains often display conductances considerably below @xmath41 conductances .    to investigate this , we have calculated the spin - paired transmission function for finite ag - o wires with semi - infinite silver chains as leads . for comparison",
    "we have also performed calculations with gold instead of silver .",
    "we use a green s function method for phase coherent electron transport , where both the green s function of the semi - infinite leads and the scattering region are evaluated in terms of basis consisting of maximally localized wannier functions.@xcite    fig .",
    "[ fig.transmissionagoauo ] ( a ) and ( b ) , show the transmission functions for finite ag - o and au - o wires sandwiched between ag and au chains , respectively .",
    "the full line is for a @xmath8ag / au - o@xmath9 wire sandwiched between leads and the dashed line is for @xmath8ag / au - o - ag / au - o@xmath9 wire between the leads .",
    "the fermi level is at zero and indicated by the vertical dashed line .",
    "the transmission function for @xmath8ag - o@xmath9 displays one eigenchannel in the energy range @xmath42 to @xmath43 , indicating that the eigenchannel state has @xmath44 .",
    "the only available state on the o atom with @xmath44 in the relevant energy range is the @xmath45 , which is then the current carrying state on the o atom .",
    "this is confirmed by the projected density of states for @xmath37 ( not shown ) , showing the resonance in the transmission function below the fermi level originating from an anti - bonding combination of the @xmath37 orbital and the @xmath46 band in the leads .",
    "the broadening of the resonance is due to the coupling to the s - band in ag .",
    "the bonding combination falls outside the ag lead bands and is a bound state . in the case of @xmath8ag - o - ag - o@xmath9 units ,",
    "the two resonances have a similar origin , but the transmission at the fermi level is reduced considerably .",

    "[ fig.transmissionagoauo ] ( b ) consists of single eigenchannel with m=0 , in the energy range from -0.15  ev to @xmath47 .",
    "below @xmath48 , there are au d - bands with @xmath38 which can couple to o @xmath38 states .",
    "this results in two extra eigenchannels making the @xmath45 resonance less visible accept for the tail starting at @xmath48 and extending to @xmath43 .    as seen in fig.[fig.transmissionagoauo ] ( a ) and ( b ) an oxygen atom scatters more strongly electrons around the fermi level in the @xmath44 channel in the case of ag than for au .",
    "this in agreement with our experiments , as we observed in fig.[fig3 ] a tendency for ag - o chains to have a lower conductance than au - o chains . however , in a more realistic contact with surface electrodes as leads , we suspect a finite coupling between @xmath38 finite @xmath49 hybrid chain states and the @xmath50 states in the metal electrodes , which would result in a higher conductance .",
    "a conductance calculation on ag - o chains involving more realistic electrodes will be published elsewhere .",
    "we also studied the longitudinal vibration - mode energies of a single oxygen atom in a silver contact , we define a supercell with @xmath51 atoms in the surface plane and which contains 7 atomic layers .",
    "the oxygen atom is clamped between two 4 atom pyramids pointing in opposite directions and is attached to ag ( 111 ) surfaces . the ag ( 111 ) surfaces are separated by @xmath52 .",
    "we use a @xmath53 k - point monkhorstpack mesh in the surface brillouin zone .",
    "the two pyramids and the oxygen atom , were relaxed , until the total residual force was below @xmath54 .",
    "the calculated longitudinal vibrational mode energies for the two apex silver atoms and the oxygen atom are : @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the 3 vibrational modes corresponds to : 1 ) the oxygen atom moving in anti - phase with the silver atoms .",
    "2 ) the two ag atoms moving in anti - phase and the oxygen atom being immobile .",
    "3 ) in phase motion of all 3 atoms .",
    "the relation between the vibration - mode energies can be accounted for by a simple model as described in the previous section and we indeed see that the value of the calculated high energy mode is in good agreement , with the measured vibrational energies in the range @xmath58 , indicating that single oxygen atoms are indeed incorporated in the chains .",
    "recently ishida @xcite presented calculations for chains of au and ag atoms with a single o atom inserted .",
    "ishida s results also show a high transmission at the fermi energy for oxygen in au chains , although for a single o atom it has more the character of a resonance . for ag",
    "the conductance is more strongly suppressed .",
    "we have studied the effects of oxygen on the atomic chain formation for the noble metals gold , silver and copper . by studying the conductance and mechanical properties of these atomic chains",
    ", we provided evidence that oxygen atoms can be incorporated in atomic chains .",
    "while atomic gold chains retain a conductance near 1 g@xmath6 when oxygen is incorporated , the conductance is much reduced for silver and copper chains that form upon chemisorption of oxygen atoms .",
    "the increased linear bond strength makes it possible to form silver - oxygen and copper - oxygen atomic chains .",
    "our analysis of the interatomic distances in the silver - oxygen and copper - oxygen chains has indicated the presence of metal - oxygen bonds in the chain .",
    "the point contact spectra obtained on the metal - oxygen chains give additional evidence that atomic ( not molecular ) oxygen is incorporated in the atomic chains .",
    "the observation that oxygen can be incorporated in atomic chains and thereby increasing the linear bond strength could open possibilities for other molecules to be incorporated in atomic chains .",
    "this could lead to interesting new physical properties of these ultimate one - dimensional structures .",
