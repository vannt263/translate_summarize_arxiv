    "the equation of state ( eos ) of dense matter plays an important role in various astrophysical phenomena such as supernova explosions and the formation of neutron stars and black holes  @xcite .",
    "simulations of core - collapse supernovae cover a wide range of thermodynamic conditions , and extremely high density and temperature may be achieved when black holes are formed by failed supernovae . the temperature may vary from @xmath11 to more than @xmath12 mev , the proton fraction changes from @xmath11 to around @xmath13 , and the density can vary from @xmath14 to more than @xmath15 . clearly , it is very difficult to construct a complete eos over such a wide range of parameters .",
    "the information of matter under extreme conditions is far beyond our knowledge of nuclear physics from laboratory experiments .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to perform a large extrapolation based on a theoretical model that is supported by microscopic theory and consistent with available experimental data . during the past few decades",
    ", great efforts have been made to study the eos of nuclear matter  @xcite . however , most of the investigations focused on detailed aspects of nuclear matter , which were often restricted to the case of zero temperature or high density with uniform distribution of particles .",
    "this kind of eos is generally not applicable for use in supernova simulations .",
    "so far , there exist only two realistic eoss which are commonly used in simulations of core - collapse supernovae , namely the one by  @xcite and the one by  @xcite .",

    "seitz cell for the description of non - uniform matter .",
    "recently , a hartree mean - field calculation  @xcite was performed for the wigner  seitz cell instead of the thomas  fermi approximation used by  @xcite .",
    "the hartree calculation can incorporate nuclear shell effects , but it requires much more computational resources .    in our earlier work  @xcite , we constructed the relativistic eos for supernova simulations , which has been widely used in astrophysical simulations over the past decade  @xcite .",
    "the eos is based on the rmf theory combined with the thomas  fermi approximation .",
    "the rmf theory with nonlinear @xmath16 and @xmath17 terms is able to reproduce nuclear matter saturation properties and provide a good description for both stable and unstable nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the thomas  fermi approximation in combination with assumed nucleon distribution functions and a free energy minimization is adopted to describe the non - uniform matter which is modeled as a mixture of a single species of heavy nuclei , alpha particles , and free nucleons that exist outside of nuclei , while the leptons can be treated as uniform non - interacting particles separately .",
    "the rmf results are taken as input in the thomas  fermi calculation , so the treatments of non - uniform matter and uniform matter in this eos are sufficient to obtain the table in a consistent manner .",
    "it would be preferable to treat the mixture of nuclei as recently done in  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite for the detailed treatment of electron captures on nuclei in supernova core .",
    "however , it is beyond the scope of the current update of the shen eos table , which has been routinely used in astrophysical simulations .    toward a more efficient and effective use of the shen eos table",
    ", we are required to make improvements in the eos given in  @xcite , hereafter referred to as eos1 .",
    "the main demand is to increase the number of temperature points which is crucial in the simulation of core - collapse supernovae . in some cases ,",
    "the temperature may reach more than @xmath12 mev , so it is encouraged to provide results at some higher temperatures although it is probably beyond the applicability of the rmf theory .",
    "it is generally believed that at sufficiently high temperature and/or density nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition to quark ",
    "gluon plasma ( qgp ) . based on experimental data from high - energy heavy ion collisions and lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) calculations ,",
    "it is known that the critical temperature for the qcd phase transition is around @xmath18 mev for zero baryon density  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we note that the nuclear eos at extremely high temperature and/or density is not reliable due to the qcd phase transition , although results of the rmf theory are provided for practical use in astrophysical simulations .",
    "another suggestion is to use a linear grid for the proton fraction @xmath19 , instead of the logarithmic @xmath19 grid used in eos1 , which can add more points in the important region @xmath20@xmath21 for supernova simulations and save memory space by reducing the number of @xmath19 points at @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , a proton - rich matter may be involved in astrophysical simulations  @xcite , and therefore the information at @xmath23 is needed . in eos1 ,",
    "the density grid spacing is only approximately equal at high density , it is now possible to perform the calculation with equal grid spacing in the whole range of density .",
    "since it is desirable and feasible to make these improvements , we work out a new version of the eos table , hereafter referred to as eos2 , which contains the same degrees of freedom as eos1 .    in recent years",
    ", there has been extensive discussion in the literature on the influence of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom in dense matter  @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that hyperons appear around twice normal nuclear matter density in cold neutron star matter  @xcite .",
    "the first hyperon to appear is @xmath0 that is the lightest one with an attractive potential in nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "@xmath24 hyperons are now considered to appear at a higher density than @xmath0 , because @xmath24 hyperons feel a repulsive potential in nuclear matter according to recent developments in hypernuclear physics  @xcite . in the work of  @xcite",
    ", the authors examined the properties of dense matter based on an extended rmf model including the full baryon octet .",

    "the effect of @xmath25-wave pion condensation was also examined in  @xcite , where the authors considered free thermal pions assuming the pion mass could not be affected by the interaction . in  @xcite , the authors examined the possibility of @xmath25-wave pion condensation in dense matter by using the phenomenological optical potentials determined from the pionic atom or pion  nucleus scattering data , and they concluded that @xmath25-wave pion condensation would hardly take place in neutron stars and especially have no chance if hyperons could participate in neutron star matter .",
    "the presence of boson condensation and deconfined quarks in neutron stars has been extensively discussed in many works  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the quark matter may exist in the core of massive neutron stars , and the hadron ",
    "quark phase transition can proceed through a mixed phase of hadronic and quark matter  @xcite .",
    "if deconfined quark matter does exist inside stars , it is likely to be in a color superconducting phase , and various color superconducting phases have been intensively investigated in recent years  @xcite . in the works of  @xcite and  @xcite ,",
    "the authors constructed the eos tables for simulations of core - collapse supernovae including the hadron ",
    "quark phase transition at high density , which were connected with eos1 at low density .",
    "the hadron ",
    "quark phase transition proceeded through a mixed phase obtained by the gibbs conditions for phase equilibrium , where the rmf model was used for the hadronic phase and the bag model was adopted for the quark phase .",
    "generally , the introduction of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom leads to a softening of the eos and thereby a corresponding reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars .",
    "the recent measurement of the shapiro delay in the radio pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 yielded a mass of @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "such a high neutron star mass provides an important constraint on the eos at high density and rules out many predictions of non - nucleonic components in neutron star interiors .",
    "however , it is currently difficult to rule out all possible exotica with the @xmath27 observation , some theoretical calculations including hyperons and/or quarks could be compatible with the observation of psr j1614 - 2230  @xcite .    among these exotic candidates ,",
    "@xmath0 hyperons are the most likely to occur in dense matter .",
    "in addition , much more experimental information is now available for @xmath0 than other hyperons  @xcite . from the experimental binding energies of single-@xmath0 hypernuclei",
    ", the potential depth of @xmath0 in nuclear matter is estimated to be around @xmath28 mev  @xcite .",
    "several recent observations of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei ( see table 4 of  @xcite ) indicate that the effective @xmath29 interaction should be considerably weaker than that deduced from the earlier measurement  @xcite .",
    "in theoretical studies of @xmath0 hypernuclei , the rmf theory with nonlinear @xmath16 and @xmath17 terms is able to provide a reasonable description of single- and double-@xmath0 hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "the influence of @xmath0 hyperons on neutron star properties has been investigated within the rmf model  @xcite .",
    "we would like to examine the effect of @xmath0 hyperons on the eos for simulations of core - collapse supernovae , while other hyperons such as @xmath24 and @xmath30 are ignored due to their relatively high threshold densities and lack of available experimental data .",
    "we construct the relativistic eos with the inclusion of @xmath0 hyperons , hereafter referred to as eos3 . for the contribution of @xmath0 hyperons in eos3",
    ", we assume that the equilibrium condition @xmath31 is valid . in a supernova explosion ,",
    "the dynamical timescale is of the order of milliseconds , which is long enough to establish equilibrium with respect to weak interactions that change strangeness on the timescale of microseconds or less  @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 hyperons can have a noticeable effect on the properties of matter mainly at high density .",
    "it is known that weak equilibrium could be achieved at densities above @xmath32 where neutrinos begin to be trapped in the core  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is justified to use the equilibrium condition @xmath31 to determine the @xmath0 fraction of supernova matter at high density where @xmath0 hyperons have a noticeable contribution .",
    "in the work of  @xcite , the authors assumed weak equilibrium among the full baryon octet when they determined the composition of supernova matter at a fixed density , temperature , and charge fraction .",
    "they examined the appearance of hyperons during the evolution of core collapse and bounce , and found that the effect of hyperons would be small in a spherical and adiabatic collapse of a @xmath33 star by the hydrodynamics without neutrino transfer  @xcite .",
    "the hyperons are expected to appear and play an important role in the thermal evolution of protoneutron stars and the black hole formation from massive stars  @xcite .",
    "we have two aims in this paper .",
    "the first is to improve the eos table according to the requirements of the users . in comparison with the earlier version ( eos1 ) ,",
    "the following improvements are made in eos2 and eos3 ( see table 1 for details of the comparison ) .    *",
    "the number of @xmath34 points is largely increased , the upper limit of @xmath34 is extended , and equal grid spacing for @xmath34 is used . *",
    "a linear @xmath19 grid is adopted instead of the logarithmic @xmath19 grid used in eos1 and the @xmath19 upper limit is extended . *",
    "the upper limit of @xmath35 is extended and equal grid spacing is used in the whole range of @xmath35 , whereas it is only approximately equal at high density in eos1 .",
    "the finer grids are favorable for better accuracy in the numerical simulations of core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the wide coverage of the conditions is necessary for numerical simulations of astrophysical phenomena including black hole formation , neutron star mergers , and nucleosynthesis .",
    "the second aim of this paper is to provide the eos table with the inclusion of @xmath0 hyperons for the use in simulations of core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the difference between eos2 and eos3 is that the contribution from @xmath0 hyperons is included in eos3 when the @xmath0 fraction is larger than @xmath36 .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ] ,",
    "we briefly describe the framework to calculate the eos table .",
    "we introduce the rmf model with the inclusion of @xmath0 hyperons and explain how to determine the rmf parameters . to make this paper self - contained , we give a brief description of the thomas  fermi approximation for the non - uniform matter . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
