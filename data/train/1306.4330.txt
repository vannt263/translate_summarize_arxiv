    "the search for and characterization of the binary supermassive black hole ( bbh ) population are of great importance to understanding both galaxy formation and gravitational wave physics .",
    "since most massive galaxies are believed to harbor central smbhs , the formation of bbhs is an inevitable consequence of frequent galaxy mergers .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the bbh system within the merged galaxy , and its interaction with the host both dynamically and via possible feedback during baryonic accretion onto one or both bhs , encode crucial information about the assembly of the bulge and the central smbh .",
    "if the bbh eventually coalesces , it will produce a gravitational siren that could be detected with future low - frequency gravitational wave experiments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given their importance for understanding the co - evolution of galaxies and smbhs , and for testing fundamental physics , bbhs have been of both theoretical and observational interest since the 1970s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "theoretical studies on bbhs in the past two decades have laid down the basic framework for the dynamical evolution of bbhs within a merged galaxy ( for a review , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the two bhs sink to the center of the merged host via dynamical friction , and form a bbh .",
    "the bbh orbit continues to decay by scattering stars in the galactic nucleus until it depletes the loss cone . in the absence of other mechanisms to further extract energy from the binary , or to refill the loss cone , the bbh will stall at @xmath9 pc scale , establishing the `` final parsec barrier '' @xcite . a number of mechanisms have been suggested to circumvent this barrier , though in most cases their effectiveness is quite uncertain : non - spherical stellar potentials ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , interactions with gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or hierarchical triple bh systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) through the kozai - lidov mechanism @xcite .",
    "once the bbh reaches orbital separations below @xmath10 pc ( for a @xmath11 bbh ) , gravitational radiation will dominate the successive decay of the binary orbit , and merge the two bhs within a hubble time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however there is considerable theoretical uncertainty in the bbh evolution from a few pc to the gravitational regime , and the time the bbh spends during this phase is not well constrained .",
    "the strongest indirect evidence for bbhs perhaps comes from the observed central light deficit in massive ellipticals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the scouring of the central stellar cusp is most easily explained by star interactions with the bbh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other indirect evidence includes unusual radio morphologies such as helical / winged / x - shaped jet or double - lobed morphologies , which are commonly explained by bbh models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* )  although the bbh interpretation is not unique for these observations .",
    "directly observing bbhs during different merger stages is challenging , given the stringent resolution requirement and the difficulty of identifying active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . while close quasar pairs ( binary quasars ) on tens of kpc scales have been known for a while ( e.g. ,",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , clear examples of kpc - scale binary agns were substantially rarer until recently ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "considerable progress has been made in the last decade on the identification of binary agns on kpc scales , mostly owing to the advent of modern , large - scale sky surveys .",
    "below a few kpc , a growing number of confirmed or candidate binary agns have been selected from multiwavelength surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , increasing the inventory of confirmed kpc - scale binary agns already by several folds .",
    "below @xmath12 pc , there is only one clear example , 0402 + 379 , where a pair of bhs with a projected separation of @xmath13 pc were detected in the radio ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) ; in addition , there is one claimed binary agn with a projected separation of @xmath14 pc in the nearby seyfert galaxy ngc 3393 @xcite .",
    "so far there is no confirmed case of a bbh with sub - pc separation .",
    "this scale is unresolvable with current instruments except with long baseline radio interferometry .",
    "thus the observational searches for sub - pc bbhs almost exclusively rely on spatially unresolved signatures .",
    "the first potential indirect signature is a periodic photometric light curve , where the periodicity may indicate the presence of a bbh .",
    "the best known candidate is oj 287 , a @xmath15 blazar with its light curve showing a quasi - period of @xmath16 yr in restframe , which is interpreted as a sub - pc bbh with a mass ratio @xmath17 in the latest models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "other examples have been claimed in the literature but these are not as robust as oj 287 ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein )",
    ".    a second signature commonly utilized to search for sub - pc bbhs is the velocity offset between the broad emission line centroid and the systemic velocity in broad - line quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the broad line region ( blr ) is gravitationally confined to the bh on sub - pc scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and see below ) , any velocity offset may reflect the orbital motion of the bh in a hypothetical binary .",
    "two classes of broad line velocity offset have attracted attention in the literature as indicators of candidate bbhs : ( 1 ) a double - peaked broad line profile , which is interpreted to mean that both bhs are active and co - rotating along with their own distinct blrs ; ( 2 ) a single - peaked broad line profile , with the broad line centroid offset from the systemic velocity , in which case only one bh is active , or both bhs are active but their blr emission can not be separated in velocity space .",
    "the second feature is also often used to argue for recoiling bhs after the coalescence of the bbh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is straightforward to select such candidate sub - pc bbhs based on these broad line diagnostics , especially in the era of massive spectroscopic surveys .",
    "examples are presented in either large samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or individual discoveries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is impossible to confirm these cases with single - epoch spectroscopy .",
    "in fact , most sub - pc bbh candidates proposed this way early on have been rejected as long - term monitoring did not observe the expected radial acceleration of the broad line from binary motion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the main difficulty here involves the poorly understood blr geometry and kinematics even for single bhs , which may mimic a bbh .",
    "for instance , the rival model for the double - peaked or offset broad lines is a disk emitter model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which does not require a bbh to explain the peculiar broad line profile .",
    "thus extraordinary caution is required when interpreting these unusual broad line profiles as bbhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , some theoretical arguments suggest that the double - peaked broad line profile is a very ineffective indicator for bbhs , given the requirement that both blrs are largely dynamically distinct while their relative motion must be large enough to separate the two peaks in the spectrum ",
    "such conditions are difficult to fulfill in reality ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the most effective , and the most definitive , way to improve the power of the broad line diagnostics to identify bbhs is multi - epoch spectroscopy .",
    "long - term spectroscopic monitoring of the broad lines can confirm or rule out the bbh hypothesis based on changes in the broad line radial velocity ( acceleration ) , given that the time baseline is long enough to see the expected binary motion and the spectral quality is adequate .",
    "earlier spectral monitoring of samples of double - peaked disk emitters did not focus on testing the bbh scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopic monitoring programs that are specifically designed to find bbhs in quasars are just starting ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we are conducting systematic searches for sub - pc bbhs in broad - line quasars using multi - epoch spectroscopy of large statistical quasar samples .",
    "in contrast to previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) which only focused on objects with offset or double - peaked broad lines , we are also targeting normal quasars with no broad line velocity offset . ] .",
    "there are two reasons for targeting normal quasars .",
    "first , quasars with double - peaked or significantly offset broad lines are only a minority of the entire quasar population ( @xmath18 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while they are more likely to be bbhs by selection , they do not represent the general quasar population where a bbh can be easily hidden in the spectrum ( since we only observe the line - of - sight velocity ) .",
    "second , the acceleration in the radial velocity from the bbh is the largest at zero velocity offset ( see  [ sec : prelim ] ) , therefore on average it is easier to detect acceleration for bbhs with non - offset broad lines than those with offset broad lines .    in this paper we present results for the general quasar population , i.e. , without pre - selection of a subsample with double - peaked or offset broad lines , based on multi - epoch spectroscopy separated by up to several years . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hb_oiii_shift ] , the vast majority of our quasars have broad line velocity offset within @xmath19 of the systemic velocity ( based on [ oiii]@xmath205007 ) .",
    "thus these quasars will not have been included in the samples of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our sample is thus substantially larger than the other two samples , allowing better statistical constraints . in the second paper of the series ( hereafter paper ii )",
    ", we will focus on a subset of quasars selected with offset broad lines , and present our own multi - epoch spectroscopic data and analysis in the context of the bbh scenario .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : prelim ] , we provide preliminaries on the broad line diagnostics in the bbh scenario .",
    "the data and our approach to measure radial velocity acceleration with multi - epoch spectra are described in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "we pay particular attention to a proper error analysis , which is key to this kind of study . in ",
    "[ sec : result ] we present candidate detections of acceleration ( which implies a possible bbh ) , and the statistical constraints on the general bbh population in quasars using ( mostly ) non - detections . in ",

    "all time separations are in the restframe of the quasar , and @xmath21 refers to the quasar bolometric luminosity unless otherwise specified .",
    "we use `` offset '' to refer to the velocity difference between two lines in single - epoch spectra , and `` shift '' to refer to the changes in the line velocity between two epochs . for simplicity",
    "we assume circular bbh orbits , but the general methodology can be applied to a bbh population with an eccentricity distribution as well .",

    "the `` detected '' sample consists of individual quasars in which a significant velocity shift has been detected ( see  [ sec : binary_candidate ] ) .",

    "since essentially all quasars in our sample have single - peaked broad lines , we initially assume that the broad line emission is dominated by one active bh .",
    "we will return to the possibility that the broad line emission comes from both bhs in  [ sec : caveat ] .    consider a postulated smbh binary on a circular orbit , where only bh 1 is active and powering its blr .",
    "the orbital period , line - of - sight ( los ) velocity and acceleration ( relative to the systemic frame ) of the active bh are : @xmath22 where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to bh 1 and 2 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the inclination of the orbit , @xmath25 is the binary separation , and @xmath26 is the orbit phase .",

    ". we did not choose the  line as our primary line for the reasons discussed in ",
    "[ sec : data ] ; ( 3 ) they used the several `` detections '' to constrain bbh models , while we believe it is more informative , and more appropriate , to use the full distribution in constraining the general bbh population ; and ( 4 ) they did not utilize individual measurement errors for their sample , and used a typical ensemble value for the measurement errors instead . this could be problematic , as the several `` detections '' in their study could be due to large individual measurement errors , and their modeling is sensitive to this detected number .",
    "all these issues may explain the different conclusions ( in particular , ju et  al .",
    "find a much lower detection fraction ) reached in the two studies , but one should also bear in mind the different assumptions that went into both analyses .",
    "we defer a more careful comparison to future work when we perform our own analysis on the  line .",
    "we have demonstrated the potential of using the broad line diagnostics , i.e. , velocity shifts between epochs , to identify and characterize the bbh population in broad line quasars .",
    "however , to improve the power of this technique , there is both observational and theoretical need to understand the broad line emission in single and binary bhs .    from an observational point of view , we need long - term spectroscopic monitoring of large samples of quasars to construct the power spectrum of the stochastic velocity shifts due to blr variability in single bhs .",
    "analogous to studying the photometric quasar continuum variability , we can construct a stochastic velocity shift `` structure function '' , i.e. , the random fluctuation of broad line shifts between epochs as a function of time separation .",
    "this must be done for a large sample to capture the diversity in the quasar population , and must be done over multi - year timescales and many epochs for the same objects , and with adequate s / n , to confirm the stochastic nature of the velocity shifts .",
    "a by - product of these programs would be potential discoveries of coherent velocity shifts , which would be the best candidates for bbhs .",
    "there are also general benefits from improved spectral quality , increased time baseline and more epochs for our statistical constraints .",
    "for instance , merely increasing the time baseline can shrink the measurement errors in acceleration .",
    "parallel observational efforts are needed to better understand the blr structure with reverberation mapping .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", we need bbh simulations with recipes for the blr gas to predict the temporal evolution of the broad line emission and its correlation with the orbital motion of the bbh , as well as the effects of the ( postulated ) circumbinary disk on the broad lines ( e.g. , how much broad line emission comes from this circumbinary disk ) , with empirical constraints from observations , such as the blr size , geometry and kinematics .",
    "we have performed a systematic search for sub - parsec bbh candidates in optically selected , broad line quasars with multi - epoch ( mostly two - epoch ) sdss spectroscopy .",
    "the spectra are separated by up to several years in the quasar restframe .",
    "our sample is composed of normal quasars , which is different from the samples in other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have shown that targeting these normal quasars is not only as efficient as targeting offset or double - peaked broad line quasars in terms of finding bbh candidates , but also provides much more robust constraints on the bbh population in quasars .",
    "our working hypothesis was that only one bh is active and that this bh dynamically dominates its own blr , and that the companion bh is orbiting at a large enough distance such that the blr is not tidally distorted or disrupted .",
    "our sample is composed of @xmath0 quasars , with typical virial bh mass estimates @xmath125 ( for the active bh ) and blr sizes @xmath216 pc .",
    "we searched for the expected acceleration ( velocity shift ) in the broad h@xmath1  line from the binary motion between the two epochs , using a cross - correlation technique .",
    "our main findings and their implications are summarized below :    * the broad h@xmath1  line shape ( fwhm , skewness , etc ) can change over multi - year timescales , but dramatic changes in fwhm ( @xmath217 ) are rare .",
    "* out of @xmath218 pairs of observations for which we have successfully measured the velocity shift between two epochs , we detected 28 systems with significant acceleration at the @xmath106 confidence level .",
    "object - by - object inspections suggest that 7 of them are the best examples of sub - parsec bbh candidates , 4 of them are best explained by broad line variability in single bhs , and the rest are ambiguous . *",
    "the full distribution of acceleration ( mostly non - detections ) for a subset from the 688 pairs with better - quality measurements and @xmath219 yr ( restframe ) was used to constrain the bbh population among general quasars . after accounting for measurement errors , excess variance",
    "is required to explain the observed distribution .",
    "if all the excess variance in velocity shifts is due to a bbh population , then ( 1 ) a large binary fraction is required ; ( 2 ) the companion bh must be orbiting within a few times the blr radius ( details depending on the companion mass , see  [ sec : general_pop ] ) ; ( 3 ) the companion bh must be more massive than the active one .",
    "on the other hand , if the excess variance is largely due to stochastic blr variability in single bhs , then the requirement for a bbh population is substantially weakened , and even disfavored in the case of a very massive companion ",
    "otherwise the predicted acceleration distribution will be broader than observed ( after convolving with errors ) .",
    "* long - term spectroscopic monitoring of the detected bbh candidates with more epochs are required to confirm or rule out the bbh hypothesis .",
    "in addition , long - term spectroscopic monitoring of normal quasars will provide vital information on the stochastic velocity shift induced by blr variability , and thus improve statistical constraints on the bbh population in broad line quasars with the methodology developed in this paper .",

    "<S> attributing all the excess to binary motion would imply that most of the quasars in this sample must be in binaries ; that the inactive bh must be on average more massive than the active one ; and that the binary separation is at most a few times the size of the blr . </S>",
    "<S> however , if this excess variance is partly or largely due to long - term broad line variability , the requirement of a large population of close binaries is much weakened or even disfavored for massive companions . future time - domain spectroscopic surveys of normal quasars can provide the vital prior information on the structure function of stochastic velocity shifts induced by broad line variability in single bhs . </S>",
    "<S> such surveys with improved spectral quality , increased time baseline , and more epochs , can greatly improve the statistical constraints of this method on the general binary population in broad line quasars , further shrink the allowed binary parameter space , and detect true sub - parsec binaries . </S>"
