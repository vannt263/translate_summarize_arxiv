    "phase ordering @xcite is one of the important topics in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . for systems with two coexisting phases the situation is generally well understood from the analytic and numeric points of view @xcite . for the potts model @xcite with a @xmath3-degenerated ground state ,",
    "the situation is not so clear in general .",
    "also in this case , an allen - cahn power - law regime @xcite and dynamical scaling relations for the structure factor and for the distribution of domain sizes @xcite have been predicted @xcite and found numerically @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a singular behaviour of the potts model has been recently observed by de oliveira et .",
    "@xcite when the degeneracy ( @xmath0 ) is large enough : in the thermodynamic limit the model was shown to relax towards a ` glassy ' , disordered , phase with a non negligible density of defects when it is quenched at zero temperature .",
    "this paper is devoted to discuss some ideas for understanding this glassy phase . in the next section we recall the phase and",
    "report new results on the ordering of the potts model after a quench at low but finite temperature .",
    "the system equilibrates locally nucleating domains that eventually become of the size of system . in section 3",
    "we study the @xmath4 case , and we interpret the impossibility to equilibrate in the thermodynamic limit as an impossibility of breaking the local zero magnetisation .",
    "section 4 is to conclude and summarise the main results .",
    "de oliveira et .",
    "@xcite have recently observed an interesting slow relaxation in the dynamics of the potts model after a quench from a disordered state to zero temperature , and the impossibility for the system to achieve the ground state in the @xmath5 limit , being @xmath6 the linear size of the system .",
    "let us briefly describe this effect . given a lattice @xmath7 , in which each site",
    "@xmath8 can take @xmath0 equivalent values , or _",
    "colours _ , the potts model @xcite is defined by the hamiltonian :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 means @xmath11 , @xmath12 is a neighbour of @xmath13 , and where @xmath14 is the colour of site @xmath13 .",
    "when quenching at zero temperature a two - dimensional system on a square lattice using glauber single spin - flip dynamics , systems with @xmath2 obey the allen - cahn law @xcite @xmath15 ( @xmath16 being the energy per site ) up to a time @xmath17 , increasing with @xmath6 , when they get trapped in a blocked configuration , invariant with respect to the single spin - flip dynamics at zero temperature @xcite and it is negligible in the thermodynamic limit . ] .",
    "inverting the usual order of the @xmath18 and @xmath5 limits , i.e. , assuming that the thermodynamic limit is taken before the infinite - time limit , and extrapolating to @xmath19 the @xmath20 data with the allen - cahn power - law @xmath15 @xcite , one finds a positive energy @xmath21 for @xmath2 and , in particular the data for @xmath22 is very well fitted by the expression @xmath23 , @xmath24 being real constants .",
    "this would imply that an infinite - size system with @xmath25 relaxes after an infinite time towards a phase with stationary observables and positive energy , different from the ground state with zero energy , and this is the reason for which this out - of - equilibrium ` phase ' is called ` glassy phase ' in @xcite .",
    "a noticeable point is that the onset of this glass - like phase occurs in the two - dimensional potts model for @xmath2 , and this @xmath0-range coincides with the one in which the system presents a first - order phase transition @xcite . a justification of this fact is in progress @xcite .",
    "we now give a general characterisation of the equilibration of the system at finite temperature , and an interpretation of the non - equilibrium phase in terms of the symmetries of the problem in section 3 .",
    "we have studied the dynamics after a quench at finite temperature , @xmath26 , of the @xmath27 colours potts model with periodic boundary conditions , being @xmath28 the critical temperature of the model @xcite . in fig .",
    "1 we present the energy per site ( on top ) and the magnetisation ( centre ) with respect to @xmath29 of a 2-d square lattice system with nearest - neighbours interaction and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the magnetisation , @xmath30 , is    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the fraction of colour @xmath33 ,",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 being the number of sites in the system with colour @xmath33 and @xmath36 is the total number of sites .",
    "the magnetisation is zero when @xmath37 , and one when all spins have the same colour .",
    "initially the system is in an uncorrelated configuration at infinite temperature , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for @xmath40 , systems with @xmath2 coarsen with equal proportion of all colours and with the expected power - law dependence of the energy on time @xcite while , for @xmath41 , finite - size systems equilibrate , breaking the @xmath39 symmetry and approaching gradually the ground state with @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the above description of the problem suggests that , for @xmath2 and for times larger than @xmath44 , coalescence effects , not considered in the derivation of the allen - cahn law , become relevant in the dynamics , and allow the mean domain size , @xmath45 @xcite , to grow up to the system size , @xmath6 .",
    "the numerical results reported in fig .",
    "1 suggest that , for @xmath46 , @xmath44 is not divergent in @xmath6 , but constant above a certain @xmath6 , i.e. , that the `` nucleation '' needed to equilibrate the system is a local process no longer dependent on @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath47 and @xmath48 curves of fig . 1",
    "coincide within @xmath49 , the variance of the distribution of energy values corresponding to different realisations of the quench ( shown in error bars ) .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "1 that the @xmath39 symmetry is broken later in larger systems . as in @xcite for the continuous ising model , the magnetisation is supposed to be zero for all times in the absence of finite - size effects , and in fact we find @xcite a similar scaling relation @xmath50 for @xmath51 , and even a slower dependence of @xmath52 on @xmath6 for @xmath2 . one could ask why @xmath44 seems to approach a limit value with @xmath53 , while the magnetisation at fixed times tends to zero in this limit . to answer this question we propose the following argument : systems with @xmath2 equilibrate leaving at @xmath54 the power - law dependence of the energy on time and forming domains that will eventually become system - sized , and @xmath44 seems to be a characteristictime of the model .",
    "it is this local nucleation the origin of the ordering , rather than the changes on the global colour fraction , which is a finite - size effect @xcite . in order to supply a quantitative support to this argument",
    "we define an order parameter , @xmath55 , accounting for the spatial ordering , which seems to characterise the dynamical ordering more than the global magnetisation , @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "let us define @xmath55 as a distance from the @xmath56 , @xmath57 , situation , where @xmath58 is the magnetisation of a cell centred in @xmath59 and of size @xmath60 , independent of @xmath6 , in such a way that @xmath61 in the thermodynamic limit . in particular ,    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the volume of the general system and @xmath64 $ ] is the proportion of colour @xmath33 in the cell centered in @xmath59 .",
    "the expression at the right of the arrow in ( 3 ) is the definition of @xmath55 in the lattice @xmath65 and @xmath66 is a cell centred in the position of site @xmath13 . , we have taken the nearest 24 neighbours of each site for the definition of the mentioned cell . ] for @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath55 so defined is zero in the completely uncorrelated configuration , and one in the ordered configuration , when all the sites have the same colour and @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath67 , @xmath55 is a distance , functional of @xmath58 , and can be used as an alternative order parameter accounting for the spatial ordering of the system .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "1 ( bottom ) that also @xmath55 presents a power - law dependence on time .",
    "as expected by the argument exposed above , @xmath55 seems not to depend on @xmath6 for large @xmath6 : curves for @xmath48 and @xmath68 coincide within their standard deviation limits .",
    "moreover , @xmath55 seems to leave the power - law regime and converge to 1 at @xmath44 .",
    "at zero temperature , the situation is different : the above defined time , @xmath44 , needed to leave the allen - cahn law is divergent with @xmath6 , as described in @xcite , and an infinite - size system is always supposed to follow the allen - cahn power - law . in larger and larger systems , it is less and less likely to find a blocked configuration or a path in phase space to the ground state .",
    "a measure of this fact can be seen in the value of the energy variance , @xmath49 , which decreases with @xmath6 ( see inset of fig .",
    "this means that in a large system it is less likely to find a deviation from the power - law regime , in which blocked dynamics @xcite or breaking of the @xmath39 symmetry @xcite are not present .",
    "this explains at a qualitative level the fact that in large systems the magnetisation is broken later ( and hence the system equilibrates later ) , but it does not address the fact that the energy of an infinite size system with @xmath2 converges to a positive value for @xmath19 . in other words , it does not explain why the term @xmath22 of the generalised allen - cahn law @xmath69 is different from zero for @xmath2 .",
    "one could ask why systems with @xmath2 can not converge to a zero energy phase in the limit @xmath5 , even respecting the @xmath39 symmetry , as the @xmath70 , 3 cases do .",
    "we discuss this point in the following .",
    "numerical simulations show that in the latest stage of the coarsening at zero temperature , systems with @xmath70 , 3 and with large enough @xmath6 ( to respect the @xmath39 symmetry ) present final configurations formed by domains of the size of system ( fig .",
    "2 , left ) and @xmath71 , the mean domain size , is proportional to @xmath6 when @xmath19 .",
    "the energy , or the perimeter of the interface , is proportional to @xmath6 , and thus , the energy per site is zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in fact we have @xmath72 for @xmath70 , 3 , as said before . on the other hand , for @xmath2",
    ", we observe that the system presents not only @xmath39 , but also a local symmetry that is a local equal fraction of all colours .",
    "we define this local symmetry by introducing a certain scale , @xmath60 , with @xmath73 , such that the magnetisation is also zero in every cell of the system of size greater than @xmath60 and _ being @xmath60 such that @xmath61 for @xmath74_. we propose , and we argue below , that the zero temperature dynamics can not form domains of the size of the system for @xmath2 , hence the perimeter of the interface ( as well as the final number of domains ) grows with @xmath75 and the energy per site of the glassy phase is not zero in the thermodynamic limit , while , in this limit , systems with @xmath76 do not break the @xmath39 symmetry when forming domains of the size of the system but they can break the local @xmath39 symmetry .",
    "a numerical confirmation of this argument is that @xmath55 converges to @xmath77 in the @xmath78 limits for @xmath76 , but @xmath79 for @xmath80 : the fraction of the volume @xmath63 for which @xmath81 is not negligible in the thermodynamic limit . in fig .",
    "3 we report the energy , magnetisation and order parameter of local ordering as a function of @xmath29 for the @xmath4 dynamics in the @xmath80 , 3 and 2 cases .",
    "it seems that @xmath55 presents the same power - law dependence on time as the energy in the @xmath80 case .",
    "inverting the order of the limits and extrapolating to @xmath19 with a linear fit , as done for the energy in @xcite , we have @xmath82 , while for @xmath51 , @xmath55 converges to 1 .    this local zero magnetisation for @xmath2 ( see fig 2 , right ) characterises the glassy phase also in the sense that it predicts a @xmath83 dependence of @xmath22 , which coincides in the @xmath84 limit with the result @xmath85 of @xcite .",
    "let us show this fact in the approximation of domains of identical size @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "in order to satisfy the local-@xmath39 condition there must be @xmath86 domains inside each cell of size @xmath60 , @xmath87 being an integer . in @xmath88 dimensions it is @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the number of domains , and setting @xmath91 we have @xmath92 .",
    "when @xmath0 approaches 4 , coalescence effects not considered in this argument become important , to which we attribute the slower dependence on @xmath0 of the energy , @xmath85 .",
    "as we have seen there are evidences that , in absence of thermal fluctuations , the metropolis dynamics can not break the local symmetry of colours when @xmath2 .",
    "this fact and the @xmath2 limit can be explained ( not yet in a rigorous fashion ) as a consequence of an assumption on the glassy phase symmetries . to introduce it",
    "let us define the @xmath0 ` coarse - grained ' fields @xmath93 $ ] , in analogy with @xcite , as the fraction of colour @xmath33 in a cell centred in @xmath59 and of size @xmath60 .",
    "clearly @xmath94 and the fields @xmath95 describe the configuration in a @xmath60-dependent way .",
    "given the fact that the hamiltonian is invariant with respect to @xmath96 , the group of permutations of the @xmath0 colours , we assume that the @xmath39 symmetric configuration corresponding to @xmath74 , @xmath18 is maximally ordered in such a way that any permutation of the colours , @xmath97 , is equivalent to a @xmath98-dependent global spatial transformation , @xmath99 .",
    "i.e. :    @xmath100    if we assume the operator @xmath101 to be linear we have that @xmath102 is a representation of @xmath96 in the vector space of linear operators in the plane , @xmath103 . since there is no representation of @xmath96 in @xmath104 for @xmath2 different from the trivial representation ( @xmath105 , the identity operator on @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) , from the above assumption it follows the local - zero magnetisation of the glassy phase for @xmath2 : setting @xmath105 in ( 4 ) we obtain @xmath108 , that with the normalisation condition gives @xmath109 @xmath110 , i.e. , the local @xmath39 symmetry in the cell of size @xmath60 .",
    "the assumption ( 4 ) can also ` justify ' the spatial symmetries of configurations with @xmath111 in the @xmath39 regime : for @xmath70 the group @xmath112 admits a nontrivial representation in the plane , @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the identity and @xmath115 is the rotation of @xmath116 radians in the polar angle and , in fact , configurations with @xmath70 in the glassy phase seem to present this symmetry ( see fig .",
    "2 , left ) , and a similar @xmath117 rotational symmetry seem to exist for @xmath118 configurations , even if it is often hindered by the two - preferred directions of the square lattice interaction @xcite and by the formation of structures locally stable under the @xmath4 dynamics @xcite .",
    "moreover , in a general @xmath88-dimensional system , there exist no nontrivial representations of @xmath96 in @xmath119 for @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "this proposition seems to be true for all @xmath2 , and we are working on the general proof .",
    "if verified , this consequence of the assumption ( 4 ) would coincide with the result by lifshitz @xcite , who argued that a @xmath88-dimensional system quenched below its critical point does not necessarily equilibrate into an ordered state , in the presence of a ground state that is degenerated more than @xmath121 times .",
    "we have studied the ordering dynamics of the 2-d potts model in a square lattice with @xmath51 and 7 by use of single - spin flip dynamic monte - carlo simulations . at positive temperature , @xmath26 , and for @xmath80",
    "the system relaxes leaving the allen - cahn power law at a given time , which is independent on @xmath6 for large @xmath6 . at zero temperature , in the @xmath5 limit ,",
    "systems with @xmath2 are not able to nucleate breaking the local symmetry , and hence they converge to a phase with nonzero energy .",
    "we give a quantitative support for this argument in the @xmath80 case with the help of an order parameter of local ordering that we define .",
    "the @xmath2 limit is presented as a consequence of a hypothesis on the symmetries of the glassy phase . for both temperatures the magnetisation at equal times decreases with increasing sizes and",
    "it is argued to be zero in the thermodynamic limit at any time @xcite .",
    "a generalisation of this study for different @xmath0 values and for larger @xmath6 is being performed @xcite together with an investigation of the relation between the ordering properties and the phase space structure .",
