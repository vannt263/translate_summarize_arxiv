    "traversable lorentzian wormholes @xcite are solutions of the equations of gravitation associated to a nontrivial topology of the spacetime : their basic feature is that they connect two regions ( of the same universe or two separate universes @xcite ) by a throat . for the case of static wormholes",
    "the throat is defined as a minimal area surface satisfying a flare - out condition @xcite . to fulfill this ,",
    "wormholes must be threaded by exotic matter that violates the null energy condition @xcite ; it was shown by visser _",
    "et al _ @xcite , however , that the amount of exotic matter needed around the throat can be made as small as desired by means of an appropriate choice of the geometry of the wormhole . +",
    "a well studied class of wormholes is that of thin ",
    "shell ones , which are constructed by cutting and pasting two manifolds @xcite to form a geodesically complete new one with a shell placed in the joining surface .",
    "this makes such wormholes of particular interest because the exotic matter needed for the existence of the configuration is located only at the shell .",
    "stability analysis of thin ",
    "shell wormholes under perturbations preserving the original symmetries has been widely developed .",
    "a linearized analysis of a thin  shell wormhole made by joining two schwarzschild geometries was performed by poisson and visser in ref .",
    "later , the same method was applied to wormholes constructed using branes with negative tensions in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the case of transparent spherically symmetric thin  shells and wormholes was studied in ref .",
    "the linearized stability analysis was extended to reissner ",

    "+ the requirement of matter violating energy conditions relates the study of wormholes to modern cosmology : current day observational data seem to point towards an accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . if general relativity is assumed as the right gravity theory describing the large scale behavior of the universe , this implies that its energy density @xmath0 and pressure @xmath1 should violate the strong energy condition .",
    "several models for the matter leading to such situation have been proposed @xcite .",
    "one of them is the chaplygin gas @xcite , a perfect fluid fulfilling the equation of state @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a positive constant .",
    "a remarkable property of the chaplygin gas is that the squared sound velocity @xmath4 is always positive even in the case of exotic matter .",

    "wormholes supported by `` phantom energy '' ( with equation of state @xmath7 ) have been studied in detail @xcite .",

    "@xcite as the exotic matter supporting a wormhole of the morris ",
    "thorne type @xcite ; there , as a possible way to keep the exotic matter within a finite region of space , matching the wormhole metric to an exterior vacuum metric was proposed .",
