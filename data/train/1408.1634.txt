    "the gravitational radiation emitted by astrophysical sources can sometimes be evaluated from exact solutions of the einstein equations , which include solutions in the strong - field regime , solutions with retardation effects in the source and solutions describing both the near - field and the far - field region @xcite .",
    "the exact solutions , however , do not cover all possible cases of interest , and general perturbation methods have been developed .",
    "such methods are similar to those employed for the maxwell equations and are typically based on the multipolar expansion @xcite , involving several approximations and assumptions :    \\(a ) linearization of the field equations .",
    "\\(b ) far field approximation .",
    "\\(c ) no retardation in the source .",
    "\\(d ) symmetry of plane wave or spherical wave .",
    "\\(e ) transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge .",
    "these approximations have of course a limited validity and in certain cases are not adequate . in our recent work",
    "@xcite we proposed a method which requires only the linearity assumption ( a ) and relaxes the others , and we used it to compute the emission of a weber bar . in practice , we computed exactly the retarded potential integrals , working in the harmonic gauge , without imposing the tt gauge .",
    "we found an explicit expression for the metric tensor , and not only for the irradiated energy - momentum , and stressed the importance of appropriate boundary conditions imposed at the ends of the bar .",
    "we compared the response to the field of a `` generalized '' two - rings detector with the response computed in the ( local ) tt gauge , and found that they are the same , because the longitudinal components of the metric which are present in the harmonic gauge have no physical effects on the detector .    in this work",
    "we apply the general method of @xcite to a problem which is relatively new and physically interesting , namely the computation of the gravitational emission of a plasma wave .",
    "the wave is modelled through an analogy with an oscillating string , whose length is larger than the wavelength of the gravitational emission .",
    "we discuss the validity and the limitations of this analogy , considering the concrete example of an alfven wave in the solar corona and we obtain analytical and numerical results for the far field and the near field ( the latter to be published in a separate paper ) .",
    "the crucial first step of our method is the explicit construction of a full conserved @xmath0 tensor ( sect .",
    "[ s1 ] ) . in the usual solution procedure of the linearized einstein equations for far - field waves ,",
    "the only relevant components of the source are the mass - energy density @xmath1 and its multipoles @xcite .",
    "this is true , however , only if all the approximations listed above are valid .",
    "if we are instead interested , for instance , into the near field or into sources with internal interference , we will need all the components of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we would like to stress that even if one works in the multipole approximation and assigns the @xmath1 component in such a way that the conservation of total momentum and angular momentum is satisfied , the condition @xmath2 may require complex internal forces between the system s components .",
    "some of these forces are the analogue of constraints in classical mechanics . in the context of general relativity constraints",
    "may have unexpected consequences ; in the case of the oscillating string , they give a major contribution to the radiation field .",
    "the construction of our conserved stress tensor is described in sect .",
    "since we can not simply assume that the string is held in tension by a rigid support , large masses @xmath3 , @xmath4 are placed at the ends of the vibrating string , to provide appropriate boundary conditions . a renormalization procedure involved in the limit for @xmath5",

    "the radiation field does not depend on @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",

    "gravitational radiation generated by terms linear in the string wave amplitude is presented in sect .",
    "analytic integration of the retarded integral solution to the einstein equation shows that the contributions of boundary conditions nearly cancel those of the interior of the string . a short string , with length much smaller than a gravitational wavelength ,",
    "can be treated as a current quadrupole . however , a naive appication of the quadrupole formula which does not take into account the string tension and the end - masses would lead to a wrong result and a grossly over - estimated radiation field .    preliminary results from numerical integration indicate a component of the radiation field not included in analytical expressions of the first order in the oscillation amplitude .",

    "[ concl ] .",
    "this might signal a fundamental conflict between the einstein equations and systems which , like the oscillating string , feature ingredients alien to the foundations of general relativity , as space - like correlations in stationary waves combined with external constraints .",
    "our method could also be applied in future to other sources for which the usual quadrupolar formula is not adequate .",
    "it could be used , for instance , to compute the radiation of an array of micro - bars oscillating at high frequency , devised for the laboratory generation of high - frequency gravitational waves ( hfgws ) .",
    "such generators have been discussed , among others , by baker and woods @xcite and by grishchuk @xcite .",
    "they are still far from concrete realization , but it has been estimated that they could generate hfgws with amplitudes only 100 times smaller than the main astrophysical sources .",
    "their high frequency implies that interference and retardation effects of the near field in the source would be important in that case .",
    "the definition of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath0 for a complex elastic physical source can be based on a general formalism developed by carter and quintana @xcite and which has been applied to neutron stars @xcite .",

    "low - frequency emission from the constraints .",
    "_ as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ h - b ] , in the limit when the constraining end - masses are very large , the frequency of their emission tends to zero , but the emitted power stays finite .",
    "physically , this should be regarded as a real dissipation . since actual constraints",
    "can supply a large but finite energy , this dissipation may be important in the total energy balance of the process .",
    "computation of numerical solutions valid at any distance , and correspondence with analytical solutions .",
    "_ the numerical evaluation of the retarded integrals allows to take into account terms depending on all powers of @xmath202 , as we saw in the example of the `` far - near field '' component of @xmath144 which persists even at distances much larger than one wavelength ( fig .",

    "these contributions proportional to @xmath68 can also be identified through their time dependence , containing terms with frequency equal to twice the fundamental frequency .",

    "the series expansions for the @xmath204 and @xmath205 bessel functions converge slowly , therefore deviations between analytic and numerical results are attributable to truncation errors .",

    "_ our explicit construction of the renormalized @xmath0 tensor of the string is consistent with the conservation of @xmath0 to first order in the oscillation amplitude .",
