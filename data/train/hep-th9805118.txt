    "in a previous paper @xcite , it was shown that a linear system of first order differential equations in the external mandelstam variables , to be referred to from now on as master equations , can in general be written for the master integrals of any feynman graph . in this paper",
    "the master equations are written for the 2-loop sunrise self - mass graph amplitudes in @xmath1 continuous dimensions and for arbitrary values of the masses as a function of the square momentum transfer @xmath0 .",
    "all momenta are euclidean , so that @xmath9 corresponds to spacelike @xmath10 .",
    "the master equations can be used for obtaining valuable information on the properties of the master integrals , for working out virtually any desired expansion , for obtaining closed analytic results ( when possible ) and , in any case , for the actual numerical calculation of the amplitudes .    in the various sections of this paper",
    "we will show    * how to use the integration by part identities @xcite , @xcite for writing the master equations ; * how to obtain the ( analytic ) values of the master integrals at @xmath2 , in the @xmath5 limit ; * how to expand the master integrals in @xmath0 at @xmath2 ; * how to expand the master integrals in @xmath4 for arbitrary @xmath0 ; * how to solve analytically the master equations when two masses are equal to zero ; * how to expand the master integrals in @xmath6 for large values of @xmath11 and arbitrary values of the masses .",
    "the appendix contains a few ready - to - use recurrence formulae , obtained by solving the integration by parts identities for the considered graph @xcite .",
    "all the algebra needed to generate the identities , the equations and the considered expansions has been processed by means of the computer program form @xcite by j. vermaseren .    while we deal with the 2 loop case only , it should be apparent from the discussion that some suitable extension of the results may apply also to more general cases .",
    "the 2-loop sunrise self - mass graph is shown in fig.1 .",
    "+    the related amplitudes , in @xmath1 continuous dimensions and fully euclidean variables , can be written as @xmath12    it is by now well known that , as a consequence of the integration by parts identities @xcite , all the above amplitudes can be expressed in terms of four master integrals @xcite , which can be taken as @xmath13 it follows from the definitions that the last three master integrals are the mass derivatives of the first , _ i.e. _ for @xmath14 @xmath15 the simplest way for deriving the required differential equations for self - mass amplitudes , which depend on a single mandelstam variable only , consists in writing for them the familiar scaling equation ( which can be obtained , for instance , by scaling in the definition eq.([1 ] ) all the integration momenta by a same factor @xmath16 and then differentiating with respect to @xmath16 ) . + for @xmath17 that procedure gives @xmath18 _ i.e. _ , on account of eq.([3 ] ) , @xmath19 a similar equation holds for each of @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xmath22 when carrying out the mass derivatives , new integrals appear , like for instance those corresponding to @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the notation of eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "all those integrals , according to the formulas of the appendix , can be expressed in terms of the master integrals .",
    "the result can be written as + where @xmath26 , the @xmath27 and the @xmath28 are polynomials in @xmath29 and @xmath0 , to be discussed in a moment , while @xmath30 is defined by @xmath31 @xmath32 being the following function of @xmath1 @xmath33 the expansion of eq.([16a ] ) in @xmath1 around @xmath34 is @xmath35 \\nonumber\\\\           & + & ( n-4)^2 \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ \\log^2(2 \\sqrt{\\pi } )       + \\frac{1}{4 } \\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{6 } + \\gamma_e^2 \\right )      -\\gamma_e \\log(2 \\sqrt{\\pi } ) \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\       & + & { \\cal o}\\left ( ( n-4)^3 \\right ) \\ ,   { \\label{16b } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "the expansion , which is given only to make easier the comparisons with other results in the literature , is however never needed in practice , despite the frequent presence of @xmath37 factors , as in eq.([16 ] ) .",
    "indeed , there is always an overall factor @xmath32 for each loop ; in the calculation of any physical ( and therefore finite ) quantity , the singularities , which are of the form @xmath38 etc . , cancel out , and in the remaining finite part it is sufficient to use the value at @xmath34 , which is simply @xmath39    the explicit expression of the polynomial @xmath26 is @xmath40 where @xmath41 the polynomial @xmath42 , for @xmath43 are given by @xmath44 @xmath45 similarly , the @xmath46 are given by @xmath47 \\ ,   { \\label{13 } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath48 \\ ,   { \\label{14 } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath49 the values corresponding to the other indices can be obtained by a suitable permutation of the masses .",
    "the above polynomials satisfy the relations @xmath50 and @xmath51    the equations eq.s([5],[7 ] ) are the master differential equations referred to in the title of this paper .",
    "they are long , but their structure is simple : they express the derivatives with respect to @xmath0 of the four master integrals as a linear combination of the master integrals themselves and of known non - homogenous terms , the coefficients being ratios of known polynomials in the masses and @xmath0 .",
    "the known terms are just products of the 1-loop , 1-denominator vacuum amplitude @xmath30 of eq.([16 ] ) , the simplest integral in the game which fixes the overall normalization .",
    "all the coefficients of the linear combinations are equal to a simple factor , depending on the dimension @xmath1 times a ratio of polynomials in @xmath0 and the masses .",
    "there is a unique denominator , the polynomial @xmath26 of eq.([8 ] ) ; note that its zeros in @xmath0 correspond to the threshold and the three pseudo - thresholds of the considered 2-loop sunrise graph .",
    "it should be apparent , from the derivation , that master equations of similar structure , ( _ i.e. _ equations whose coefficients are ratios of polynomials ) can be established for the master integrals of virtually any feynman graph , for any number of loops ; the size of the polynomials is expected to grow quickly with the number of the denominators and of the loops , but they are in any case finite polynomials , which can be conveniently dealt with by means of an algebraic program .",
    "quite in general , the non - homogeneous terms correspond to amplitudes of related feynman graphs in which one of the propagators is missing ; from this point of view , the @xmath52-loop sunrise amplitudes are the simplest @xmath52-loop amplitudes , in the sense that in their equations the non - homogeneous terms are just products of @xmath53 1-denominator vacuum amplitudes , eq.([16 ] ) .",
    "sunrise amplitudes are in turn present as non - homogeneous terms in the equations for the amplitudes of graphs having one more propagator and so on .",
    "as it will be shown in the rest of the paper , the master equations contain virtually all the information needed for studying the analytic properties of the master integrals and for obtaining any expansion of interest ; furthermore , after some minor work ( the expansion in @xmath4 at @xmath34 ) , the differential equations can be used for the actual numerical evaluation of the master integrals , without explicit reference to the original integral representation eq.([1 ] ) , once the values of the integrals are known at some initial value of @xmath0 .",
    "both the expansion in @xmath4 and the evaluation of the initial values ( at @xmath54 ) , can be carried out by exploiting the information contained in the master equations ( which hold identically in @xmath1 and are regular at @xmath2 despite the appearance of an apparent kinematical singularity at that value of @xmath0 ) .",
    "from the definitions eq.s([1],2 ) , it is obvious that all the master integrals as well as all their derivatives are regular at @xmath2 ( which in the considered euclidean region corresponds to @xmath55 ) .",
    "if we introduce the vacuum graph of fig.2 +    and the corresponding amplitude @xmath56 the @xmath54 values of the master integrals defined in eq.s([2 ] ) can then be written as @xmath57 let us now consider the differential equations eq.([5 ] ) and eq.([7 ] ) for , say , @xmath58 at @xmath54 .",
    "due to the regularity of the derivatives , the left hand sides of both equations vanish ; therefore , the right hand sides must also vanish at @xmath54 .",
    "it turns out that both equations involve the same combination of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , namely @xmath61 ; by eliminating that combination , one is left with a single equation involving only @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which is its derivative with respect to @xmath64 , according to eq.([19 ] ) ; in terms of the above vacuum amplitude the equation reads @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the same as in eq.([8a ] ) .",
    "eq.([20 ] ) is the master equation for the 2-loop vacuum amplitude of fig.(2 )  this time in one of the masses ( the differential equations in the other masses are immediately obtained by a suitable permutation of the masses themselves ) .",
    "it is also easy to see that the same equations can be obtained by writing down directly the integration by part identities for @xmath67 , eq.([18 ] ) and the related amplitudes .",
    "eq.([20 ] ) can be used for evaluating @xmath68 once its  initial \" value corresponding to a particular value of @xmath64 is given .",
    "note that the equation itself can provide such a value .",
    "indeed , the vacuum amplitude and all its derivatives are regular for non - vanishing values of the masses ; by considering the particular value @xmath69 , the factor @xmath66 on the _ l.h.s .",
    "_ of eq.([20 ] ) vanish , so that the _ r.h.s .",
    "_ must also vanish ; that amounts to the relation @xmath70 \\ .   { \\label{21 } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq.([21 ] ) can be taken as the  initial condition \" which determines completely the solution of eq.([20 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the differential equation eq.([20 ] ) , a first order equation in a single unknown function , can be solved in quadrature using the initial value given by eq.([21 ] ) .    for the explicit calculations it is convenient to expand the amplitude @xmath67 around @xmath34 , where it is expected to develop polar singularities in @xmath4 .",
    "more exactly , eq.([16 ] ) shows that @xmath71 has a single pole @xmath4 , so that the non homogenous part of eq.([20 ] ) and the initial value @xmath72 , eq.([21 ] ) , both develop double poles ; it follows that also @xmath67 can have at most double poles .",
    "it can therefore be expanded as @xmath73 where @xmath32 is given by eq.([16 ] ) and @xmath74 has been treated as an overall factor according to the remarks preceding eq.([17 ] ) .",
