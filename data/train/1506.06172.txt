    "optimal control theory is an effective tool in real world modelling such as physical , biological , economical and other models .",
    "diverse examples are studied in@xcite and @xcite .",
    "optimal control theory is used in chemotherapy of cancer@xcite .",
    "several papers are studied about epidemiology from optimal control theory viewpoint , for example @xcite.the most important classical method in optimal control theory is the remarkable result of pontryagin maximum principle(pmp ) that be used in various forms in applied problems .",
    "there are necessary conditions in pmp that lead to limitations in applications .",
    "these conditions can occurred for functions in state equations , cost function and control functions . here",
    "we interested in finding a new optimal control method with more proficiency in complicated cases . in this technique ,",
    "control functions selected among the stepwise functions .",
    "another notable point in the new manner is the combination of the heuristic and classical methods . in the forthcoming sections , numerical forward - backward sweep method and stepwise method",
    "are applied to some problems such that one can obtain a clear vision about potency and power of the new method .",
    "furthermore stepwise method works easily in the problems with more complicated cost functions in contrast to classical methods . in this paper the proficiency of stepwise method",
    "is shown in some models .",
    "in this section , we describe the stepwise method through the simple example .",
    "consider the problem    @xmath0    subject to @xmath1 and the control constrain @xmath2.$ ] solution : we can find the optimal control function @xmath3 via pmp .",
    "the hamiltonian is    @xmath4    one can find the optimal control policy by differentiating @xmath5 with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "thus    @xmath7    so that the control function is @xmath8 that @xmath3 stays within the interval @xmath9.$ ] we next drive the adjoint equation as @xmath10 this equation can be solved and @xmath11 when we impose the control constraint @xmath9,$ ] the optimal control is obtained : @xmath12    the final cost @xmath13 is @xmath14 . for solving this problem by new method ,",
    "we changed the maximization problem to minimization through converting @xmath13 to @xmath15 and the final cost in minimization problem is @xmath16 .",
    "when we use pmp , the control functions must satisfy the special conditions . in practical applications , we are not able to change control value every moment continuously .",
    "but we can change control values in some slices of time that lead to step function . in order to solve this problem by stepwise method , we seek control function among stepwise functions . for this purpose ,",
    "we divide @xmath17 $ ] into equal parts .",
    "suppose that the control function @xmath3 has a constant value in each part .",
    "let us enter the stepwise control function in control system  = 13 , @xmath18 . for @xmath19 $ ] , , we have @xmath20 and",
    "one can solve the ode @xmath21 . for @xmath22 $ ]",
    ", we solve the ode @xmath23 together with initial condition @xmath24 that is the terminal point of system in @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "same procedure repeat for @xmath25 when @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "we can compute cost for a typical stepwise control function and search for the optimal values for @xmath27 . in this manner",
    "we convert the optimal control problem to optimization problem . for solving the optimization problems ,",
    "we are able to use some analytical and heuristic and metaheuristic methods such as pattern search , simulated annealing , genetic algorithm , and other methods which these methods works easily in the problems with complicated systems and cost functions",
    ". there may be exist an important question here about the final cost .",
    "is it possible that the difference between final cost in pmp method and in stepwise method exceeds from our expectation there is a simple lemma about stepwise functions and continuous functions can be helpful here .    for every continuous function @xmath3",
    ", there is a sequence @xmath28 of stepwise functions that @xmath29    using this lemma , we can be confident that the new method do not generate useless solutions .",
    "note that some step functions are not able to satisfy the pmp condition and do not belong to admissible controls .",
    "but it is likely , we can find step function in new method with lower cost than pmp solution .",
    "the final cost in the stepwise method equal to @xmath30 .",
    "we illustrate this method in figure below .",
    "note that , we have obtained all the numerical results in 20 - 30 run times .",
    "we continue our study on 3-step stepwise method via pattern search , simulated annealing and genetic algorithm .",
    "the results is illustrated in next figure and table .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "as we mentioned before , there are limitations for admissible controls in pmp approach such as continuity with respect to time and others .",
    "practically , we are not able to change the value of control function in every moment of time interval . instead , one can change the control value at several time sections.thus , it seems that the stepwise method is a reasonable way in real world applications .",
    "for example , when you want to make a decision about resource allocation in epidemiological models , you can not alter your strategy in short time interval . because changing the vaccination rate or prevention strategy may imposes heavy costs .",
    "there are same problems in optimal control model of treatment of disease through the use of drugs .",
    "it seems that there are sufficient motivation to practice the stepwise method in real world processes .",
    "the next examples show the performance of stepwise method in contrast to classical pmp method .",
    "optimal control methods are useful in optimal control model of chemotherapy .",
    "renee fister et al in@xcite studied different cell - kill models of chemotherapy .",
    "they characterized optimal control strategy that minimizes the cancer mass and the cost of total amount of drug .",
    "we use stepwise method for some of their models .",
