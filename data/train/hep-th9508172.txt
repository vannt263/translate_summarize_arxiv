    "more than twenty years ago , brezin , le guillou and zinn - justin ( bgz ) studied the phase transition of a cubic anisotropic system by means of renormalization group equations @xcite . within a @xmath4-expansion",
    ", they found that to lowest nontrivial order in @xmath5 , the only stable fixed point for @xmath6 is the @xmath7-symmetric one , where @xmath8 is the number of field components appearing in the cubic anisotropic model .",
    "they interpreted this as an indication that the anisotropy is irrelevant as long as @xmath8 is smaller than four . for @xmath9 , the isotropic fixed point destabilized and the trajectories crossed over to the cubic fixed point .",
    "recently , our knowledge of perturbation coefficients of the renormalization group functions of the anisotropic system was extended up to the five - loop level by kleinert and schulte - frohlinde @xcite .",
    "since the perturbation expansions are badly divergent , they do not directly yield improved estimates for the crossover value @xmath10 where the isotropic fixed point destabilizes in favor of the cubic one .",

    ", the pad approximation is known to be inaccurate .",
    "in fact , the most accurate renormalization group functions for that theory have been obtained by combining perturbation expansions with large - order estimates and using a resummation procedure based on borel - transformations @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to derive the large - order behavior of the renormalization group functions for the anisotropic @xmath13-theory . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will combine these results with the five - loop perturbation expansion of kleinert and schulte - frohlinde to derive the precise value for the crossover value @xmath10 .    for the simple @xmath13-theory ,",
    "the large - order behavior of perturbation coefficients has been derived by lipatov @xcite , bgz @xcite and others @xcite@xcite in a number of papers .",
    "the generalization to the @xmath7-symmetric case was given in @xcite .",
    "an equivalent method for calculating the large - order behavior is based on the observation that for a negative coupling constant green functions possess an exponentially small imaginary part due to the fact that the ground state is unstable @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part is associated with the tunneling decay rate of the ground state .",
    "it determines directly the large - order behavior of the perturbation coefficients via a dispersion relation in the complex coupling constant plane .    in the semiclassical limit",

    "the imaginary part is a consequence of a negative frequency mode in the spectrum of the fluctuation operator , whose determinant enters the one - loop correction to the instanton contribution .",

    "they proposed an extended dimensional regularization scheme for nonperturbative renormalizing the imaginary parts of vertex functions .    in the present work we have to extend this scheme to the case of a @xmath16-theory with cubic anisotropy , where the energy functional has the following form : @xmath17 \\,\\ , .\\ ] ] for @xmath18 , the corresponding model in quantum mechanics was first studied by banks , bender and wu @xcite who used multidimensional wkb - techniques to derive the large - order behavior of the perturbation expansion for the ground state energy . in @xmath19 janke",
    "@xcite presented a more efficient calculation using a path integral approach . in the present work",
    ", this approach will be generalized to quantum field theory and extended by a careful discussion of the region near the isotropic limit @xmath20 .",
    "this is important , since the infrared - stable cubic fixed point is expected to appear very close to the @xmath7-symmetric one .",
    "in fact , it will be sufficient to give the quantum - field theoretical generalization of @xcite in terms of an expansion about the isotropic case in powers of @xmath1 .",

    "we use the extended renormalization scheme of @xcite to find the full ( real and imaginary ) vertex functions , and derive the renormalization constants to one loop . in",
    "we calculate the imaginary parts of the renormalization - group functions and thus the large - order behavior of the perturbation coefficients .",
    "in , finally , we extend the results to the physically relevant case @xmath22 .",
    "for positive coupling constants @xmath23 and @xmath1 , the system defined by the energy functional ( [ hn ] ) is stable and the green functions are real . on the other hand , if both coupling constants are negative the system is unstable and the green functions acquire an imaginary part .",
    "the corresponding functional integrals can be calculated by an analytical continuation from positive to negative coupling constants , keeping the factor @xmath24}$ ] real .",
    "we perform this analytical continuation by means of a joint rotation in the two complex planes , substituting @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and rotating the azimuthal angle @xmath27 from @xmath28 to @xmath29 . at the same time",
