    "the beautiful classification of @xmath3-bridge links by rational numbers has not yet been generalized to 3-bridge links .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to introduce a tool that eventually might lead to a generalization of this classification .",
    "it is well known @xcite that every closed , orientable @xmath0-manifold can be obtained by pasting pairs of faces of a polygonization of the boundary @xmath4 of a closed @xmath0-cell @xmath5 .",
    "thurston s construction of the borromean rings , @xcite and @xcite , is a nice example that we generalize for all links in this paper , fig .",
    "[ borro ] . in this example",
    "we notice that the cube is actually a closed @xmath0-cell @xmath6 with twelve faces on its boundary that are identified by reflections along some axes ( double arrows ) .",
    "moreover , pasting the faces of the cube we obtain @xmath7 and the set of axes become the borromean rings .",
    "these reflections resemble the way a butterfly closes its wings , and we will say that the borromean rings have a @xmath8-butterfly representation , and the six faces of the real cube are the six butterflies involved .",
    "[ h ]    graphics / figure1.eps    similarly to the borromean rings , the @xmath3-bridge knots or rational links @xmath9 can be obtained by pasting the northern and southern hemispheres of @xmath4 with themselves by reflections through half meridians separated apart @xmath10 for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] depicts this construction for @xmath11 , the trefoil knot . as in thurston s example , @xmath7 is obtained by pasting the faces .",
    "we say that the rational link @xmath9 has a @xmath3-butterfly representation , and the northern and southern hemispheres of @xmath4 are the two butterflies involved .",
    "this butterfly representation of @xmath9 has two main advantages .",
    "first , it is a pure @xmath3-dimensional diagram , and secondly , it exhibits directly the rational number @xmath9 that classifies the knot or link .    with these two properties in mind , we wondered if all knots and links have a similar structure , allowing two or more butterflies on the boundary @xmath4 of @xmath12 one such structure with three butterflies is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b .",
    "it turns out that every knot or link admits such a representation .",
    "we prove this fact here . in sections",
    "[ butlink ] and [ linkbut ] we give algorithms to pass back and forth from a link to a butterfly representation of it .",
    "we define accordingly the butterfly number of a knot or link and we prove that it coincides with its bridge number ( section [ number ] ) . to obtain this last result",
    "we need to reduce the number of butterflies of a particular butterfly representation of a link .",
    "this involves the definition of a move that does precisely this .",
    "see section [ move ] .    as each @xmath13-bridge link diagram has an @xmath13-butterfly representation ,",
    "a natural question arises : _ is it possible to associate a set of rational numbers to describe this butterfly _ ? in the case @xmath14 this assignation can , in fact , be made @xcite , where a triple of rational numbers is associated to each 3-butterfly . in this paper",
    "we show some examples of @xmath0-butterflies and its corresponding set of rational numbers .",
    "we give many examples and in particular two different @xmath0-butterfly representations of the same knot @xmath2 this raises the problem of relating @xmath0-butterfly representations by a set of potential moves .",
    "this is left as an open problem . using the concept of @xmath0-butterfly",
    ", we hope to obtain a classification of @xmath0-bridge links , similar to the schubert classification of @xmath3-bridge links .",
    "in section [ def ] we present a technical definition of an @xmath13-butterfly even though in the rest of the paper , for simplicity , we speak more intuitively about @xmath13-butterflies .    in the last decade , kauffman @xcite has been developing the theory of virtual knots .",
    "this theory has several applications .",
    "the technical definition of an @xmath13-butterfly is used intensively in @xcite where we prove that any virtual knot also admits a representation by a generalized @xmath15-butterfly , that is a handlebody of genus @xmath16 with @xmath17 faces on its boundary that are identified by reflections along some axis .    as we have remarked above , pasting the faces of an @xmath13-butterfly",
    "gives the @xmath18-sphere @xmath7 .",
    "section [ s3 ] is devoted to showing this fact . in general , this result is not true for generalized @xmath15-butterflies that represent virtual knots .",
    "intuitively , an @xmath13-butterfly is a @xmath0-ball @xmath5 with @xmath13 @xmath19 polygonal faces on its boundary @xmath20 such that each face @xmath21  is subdivided by an arc @xmath22  in two subfaces ( that have the same number of vertices ) that are identified by a  reflection  along this arc @xmath23    in order to formalize this concept ,  we give some technical definitions .",
    "let @xmath24 be a connected graph embedded in @xmath20 where @xmath5 is a closed @xmath0-cell , so that @xmath25 is a disjoint union of open 2-cells . for our purposes",
    "we assume that @xmath5 is the half ball @xmath26 and that the graph @xmath24 and later the graph @xmath27 , when @xmath28 has been defined , is contained in the planar part of @xmath29 the edges in @xmath24 and in @xmath28 are simple arcs .",
    "however , by @xcite , for any such graph @xmath27 there is an autohomeomorphism of @xmath4 such that the images of the edges are straight planar line segments .",
    "we shall assume , in the proofs of theorems that follow , but not in the drawn figures , that the edges of @xmath27 are straight planar line segments .",
    "we denote each open @xmath3-cell generically by @xmath30 we would like to parameterize each @xmath3-cell @xmath21 .    for any @xmath31 ,",
    "let @xmath32 be the regular polygon that is the closed convex hull of the @xmath33roots of unity .",
    "we define a parameterization of @xmath21 to be a function @xmath34 from @xmath32 to the closure @xmath35 of @xmath36 with the following properties :    \\a ) the restriction of @xmath34 to interior @xmath32 is a homeomorphism from interior @xmath32 to @xmath30    \\b ) the restriction of @xmath34 to an edge of @xmath32 is a piecewise linear homeomorphism from that edge to an edge in the graph @xmath37    \\c ) @xmath34 as a map from the edges of @xmath38 to the edges of @xmath39 is at most 2 to 1 .",
    "the existence of a parameterization of @xmath21 places restrictions on @xmath21 and on @xmath37 we will assume that @xmath24 is such that each @xmath21 has a parameterization @xmath40 and we fix a parameterization @xmath41 for each @xmath30    complex conjugation , @xmath42 restricted to @xmath32 or to boundary of @xmath32 defines an involution and an equivalence relation on the edges and vertices of @xmath32 , and this in turn , induces an equivalence relation on the edges and vertices of @xmath43 and on the points of @xmath44 as well .",
    "that is to say for @xmath45 and @xmath46 points of @xmath35 , @xmath47 if @xmath48 or @xmath49 where @xmath50    the equivalence relation on the edges and vertices of each @xmath35 induces an equivalence relation on the graph @xmath37 that is @xmath51 if and only if there exists a finite sequence @xmath52 with @xmath53 for @xmath54 equivalence classes of points of @xmath44 contain two points except for those points in @xmath55 \\right )   $ ] where there is only one point .",
