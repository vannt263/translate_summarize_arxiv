    "the phenomenon of bose  einstein condensation in atomic gases @xcite lends itself to the study of many fundamental effects . among them",
    ", one aspect presently being investigated both theoretically and experimentally is the interaction of light with atoms in the quantum degeneracy regime @xcite . in this context , the propagation of light inside a cold gas is still an open problem . because of the optical density , it is well known that the transmission of resonant light through a condensate is almost zero @xcite .",
    "however , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite was found to allow the propagation of light by means of quantum coherence between different internal atomic levels @xcite . in this context , hau et al discovered a remarkable property of pulse propagation in a bose condensate .",
    "these authors demonstrated the slowing down of the group velocity of the pulse to 17 meters / sec @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they have shown a definite dependence of the group velocity on the temperature of the ultra - cold sample .",
    "one would like to understand the observed temperature dependence from first principles .",
    "for this purpose , it is necessary to extend the standard theory of eit to a cold gas at finite temperature .",
    "however , a theoretical description of this problem is rather complex .",
    "complexities arise when one attempts a systematic treatment of interactions , finite temperature effects and dynamics .",
    "most studies treat these aspects as disjoint : interactions are included in the zero temperature case to study the kinematical aspects @xcite , whereas some dynamical aspects are studied using only the excitations within the electronic ground state @xcite , and finite temperature effects are usually studied for noninteracting bosons @xcite .",
    "a complete theory should study all these aspects together .",
    "however , a complete theory of the interaction of light and interacting particles is still unavailable , and a full numerical treatment is a rather hard task . here , we present approximate but plausible arguments to explain the experimental observations in @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of our model allows for an analytical expression for the group velocity in the following cases : atoms confined in a box and by a harmonic potential .",
    "we obtain results which reproduce the ones in @xcite for @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the treatment brings out the factors playing key roles in the phenomenon . here",
    ", we show that the variation of spatial density of atoms with temperature is the major factor responsible for the temperature dependence of the group velocity .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section ii the model is introduced . in section",
    "iii we derive the group velocity of a pulse propagating in an ideal gas confined inside a box , extend the calculation to the case of an ideal gas in a harmonic oscillator potential , and present and discuss the results in relation to the experiment of hau et al . in section",
    "iv we present estimates for the group velocity in the interacting case and in the limit of zero temperature .",
    "in this section we introduce the model used throughout this article . here , we write the maxwell - bloch equations which describe the dynamics of the system consisting of light field and atoms .",
    "we derive the linear response of the medium to a weak probe field , taking into account the quantum statistics of the atoms .",

    "4 , where it is shown that the phenomenon observed in @xcite is mainly dependent on the change in the density . + for an ideal gas in a harmonic oscillator potential at @xmath205 , all the atoms are in the ground state , and a rough estimate of the density gives @xmath209 . taking @xmath210 sodium atoms and @xmath211 hz , @xmath212 hz , @xmath213 , the ground state dimensions are @xmath214 and @xmath215 , and we obtain a density @xmath216 atoms per  @xmath217 .",
    "thus , according to ( [ estima ] ) , the group velocity is @xmath218 m / sec .",
    "+ for an interacting gas in the thomas - fermi limit , the cloud is an ellipsoid of axes @xmath219 in the radial direction and @xmath220 in the axial direction , where @xmath221 is the thomas - fermi radius :    @xmath222    and @xmath223 is the chemical potential , defined as @xmath224 with @xmath225 scattering length , @xmath226 geometrical average of the oscillator frequencies and @xmath227 corresponding oscillator size .",
    "taking @xmath228 nm , for the set of parameters of the experiment the thomas - fermi dimensions of the cloud are @xmath229 and @xmath230  .",
    "considering the density of atoms as homogeneous , we obtain @xmath231 atoms per @xmath217 . from eq .",
    "( [ estima ] ) we find for the group velocity @xmath232 m / sec , which is comparable with the value measured in @xcite for temperatures below the critical temperature .",
    "therefore , for @xmath233 atoms we find a difference of two orders of magnitude in the value of the group velocity between the ideal case and the interacting case .",
    "such difference increases or decreases depending on the total number of atoms in the trap .",
    "this estimate substantiates the inference that interactions are responsible for a lower density , and therefore , for a higher average group velocity of the light .",
    "we have derived an approximate analytical expression for the group velocity of a pulse propagating through an ultracold gas which is confined in a box and by a harmonic potential .",
    "we have shown that the results reproduce qualitatively the experimental ones presented in @xcite . from our analysis it emerges that the definite variation of the group velocity with the temperature of the gas is an effect related to the variation of the spatial density of the gas .",
    "we see that the ideal gas model provides a qualitative description of the results for @xmath0 .",
    "however , the behaviour at @xmath125 can be described in a satisfactory way only by including the interactions and the fact that the cloud is cooled by means of evaporative cooling .",
    "the last one has the effect of making the total number of atoms temperature - dependent .",
    "such effects will be the subject of future investigations .",
