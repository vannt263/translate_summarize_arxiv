    "infinitely extended many - electron systems .",
    "the first of them is related with poisson equation and lies in possible incompatibility of the boundary conditions for @xmath0 with the distribution @xmath1 renewed by means of the schrdinger equation solutions and substituted to the right - hand side of the poisson equation ( [ poisson - gen ] ) . rigorously speaking ,",
    "it means the iteration process can not be continued . to manage this difficulty",
    "there were several empirical techniques suggested ( see e.c .",
    "@xcite ) but their shortcomings are either lack of iteration convergence and a transfer to some kind of variation solution instead ( see @xcite , appendix b ) , or an appearance of solution instability @xcite or a change in the positive charge distribution @xcite that violates the derivation conditions of self - consistent field equations as variational equations . in the case of",
    "extended but finite systems , the effect may result in the non - physical growth of the electric filed far away from the inhomogeneity region @xcite .",
    "the compliance of obtained solution with true one is an open question in all cases .",
    "the suggested approach to deal with this problem are described in section [ poiss - iter sec ] for systems with fermi level given at the infinity and in section [ finite number sec ] for systems with given number of electrons .",
    "the second problem results from the existence of continuous spectrum of hamiltonian eigenvalues for unbounded systems .",
    "it is necessary to have such a definition of hilbert space with eigenfunctions of continuous spectrum as elements , which would be convenient in numerical applications .",
    "a limiting transition to hamiltonian operator with continuous spectrum by means of the unlimited increase in system size is used to build up mathematically the hilbert space of singular self - adjoined operators ( see e.c .",

    "the adopted form of the scalar product provides self - adjointness of hamiltonian operator and , respectively , the orthogonality of all eigenfunctions corresponding to the different eigenvalues .",
    "in addition , it allows to normalize them effectively to delta - function and to prove the orthogonality of the  right  and  left  current - carried eigenfunctions belonging to twofold degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "this is particularly of the essence for the problem of tunneling through a self - consistent barrier considered as an example in section [ schred - hilb sec ] .",

    "difficulties of calculations of wave functions of the continuous spectrum are also present in problems of type of surface properties of metals where one has deal with the semi - infinite inhomogeneous electron gas .",
    "attempts to replace the unbounded system by a system of finite size give rise to serious complications both in analytical and in numerical computations ( see e.c .",

    "there are many reasons , including mentioned in the present work , to believe that charge instability observed in simulations of large electronic structures is rather sign of divergency than slow convergency of the simple iteration cycle of poisson@xmath197schrdinger@xmath197poisson steps .",
    "the continuous appearance of new more and more cumbersome and sophisticated mixing methods during the last three decades is the best evidence of this point of view ( see some historic commentary in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite ) . as a rule ,",
    "the demonstration of the benefit of a new method is accompanied by illustrations of the lack of convergence of the old one as the structure size becomes larger .",
    "it is of interest , the mixing scheme based on some handmade modeled screening succeeds relatively @xcite , although it was constructed on the ground of rather formal mathematical reasoning than the underlying physics discussed here .",
    "it needs also to note that mixing schemes may produce a spurious convergency ( see @xcite , p. 11176 ) .",
    "thus it is necessary to check whether the norm of the functional derivatives @xmath198 and @xmath199 , which are residuals of poisson and schrdinger equations , are minimal along with  the total energy @xmath188 .",
    "of course , @xmath188 is the total energy of sufficiently large but finite system that can be approximated by assignment of boundary conditions as in the infinitely extended one .",

    "<S> calculations of the ground state of inhomogeneous many - electron systems involve a solving of the poisson equation for coulomb potential and the schrdinger equation for single - particle orbitals . due to nonlinearity and complexity this set of equations </S>",
    "<S> , one believes in the iterative method for the solution that should consist in consecutive improvement of the potential and the electron density until the self - consistency is attained . </S>",
    "<S> though this approach exists for a long time there are two grave problems accompanying its implementation to infinitely extended systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the first of them is related with the poisson equation and lies in possible incompatibility of the boundary conditions for the potential with the electron density distribution renewed by means of the schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> rigorously speaking , it means the iteration process can not be continued . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution of this difficulty is proposed for both infinite conducting systems in jellium approximation and periodic structures . </S>",
    "<S> it provides the existence of self - consistent solution for the potential at every iteration step due to realization of a screening effect .    the second problem results from the existence of continuous spectrum of hamiltonian eigenvalues for unbounded systems . </S>",
    "<S> it needs to have a definition of hilbert space basis with eigenfunctions of continuous spectrum as elements , which would be convenient in numerical applications . </S>",
    "<S> it is proposed to insert a limiting transition into the definition of scalar product specifying the hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> it provides self - adjointness of hamiltonian and , respectively , the orthogonality of eigenfunctions corresponding to the different eigenvalues . in addition , it allows to normalize them effectively to delta - function and to prove the orthogonality of the right and left eigenfunctions belonging to twofold degenerate eigenvalues . </S>"
