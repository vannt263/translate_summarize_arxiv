    "the @xmath0 state has , since its discovery @xcite by the _ b_@xmath7_a_@xmath7_b_@xmath7_a@xmath7r _  collaboration ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , raised several interesting questions on its nature @xcite .",
    "however , the light - scalar - meson hypothesis from unitarization @xcite has made important progress with the discovery of the @xmath0 state ( most likely @xmath8 ) .",
    "not often it happens that in experiment a state is discovered which seems difficult to handle within other theories @xcite , but can be explained by the unitarization hypothesis without extra ingredients .    of course , this happened before with the light scalar mesons , which can easily be handled within a unitarized model for all non - exotic mesons @xcite , without making any distinction between the heavier scalar mesons and the light ones . but seventeen years after the publication of these results @xcite , their implications are still not fully understood , nor applied in data analysis .    in the specific case of the @xmath0 state , just by applying the model parameters established twenty years ago @xcite , the unitarization scheme results in a bound state below the @xmath2 threshold , for a @xmath1 confinement spectrum with ground state at 2.545 gev , almost 200 mev above the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "this achievement is entirely similar to the _ extra _ states obtained by the same model for the light scalars .",
    "no additional interactions are necessary to explain the scalar mesons .",
    "in the unitarization scheme , we describe meson - meson scattering by the wave equation    @xmath9    the operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively describe the dynamics of two free mesons and of a confined quark - antiquark system .",
    "the latter is supposed to generate an infinity of confinement states .",
    "transitions from confined quarks to free mesons , mediated by quark - antiquark - pair creation , is described by @xmath12 .    by comparison of eq .",
    "( [ scatteqn ] ) with the usual expressions for scattering wave equations , we conclude that the generalized potential @xmath13 for meson - meson scattering is given by    @xmath14    with the definitions given in appendix  [ tmtrx ] , in particular formulae ( [ opmodel ] ) , ( [ caljcalh ] ) and table  [ masses ] , we obtain for the partial - wave scattering phase shift generated by wave equation ( [ scatteqn ] ) the result    @xmath15    the expression ( [ partialpshift ] ) , which is an exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ scatteqn ] ) , is very compact and elegant .",
    "but the summations over the radial excitations of the confined system do not converge fast .",
    "hence , for the numerical calculation of scattering quantities it is not suitable .",
    "a more practical method has been described in ref.@xcite . nevertheless , because of its close contact with the physical situation , expression ( [ partialpshift ] ) is extremely comprehensible , and useful as a starting point for making approximations .",
    "for example , when we are studying a limited range of energies , we may restrict the summation to only the few terms near in energy , characterized by @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ partialpshift ] ) , and approximate the remaining terms by a simple function of @xmath17 , the relative meson - meson linear momentum .",
    "notice , however , that the resulting expression is only of the type of a breit - wigner ( bw ) expansion when the strength of the transition , characterized by @xmath18 , is small .",
    "for larger values of @xmath18 , expression ( [ partialpshift ] ) behaves very differently from bw expansions .",
    "another , in practice very useful approximation is inspired by the radial dependence of the transition potential @xmath12 , which is depicted in ref .",
    "@xcite for meson - meson scattering in the cases @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , we find there that @xmath12 is peaked at short distances .",
    "if we , moreover , take into account that eigenfunctions of the confinement hamiltonian @xmath11 must also be of short range , then we may just define a transition radius @xmath22 and approximate the spatial integrals of formula ( [ caljcalh ] ) by choosing a spherical delta shell @xmath23 . in this case",
    "we end up with the expression    @xmath24    this way we have pulled the @xmath17 dependence outside the infinite summation over the radial confinement spectrum , which makes it much easier to handle truncations , as now the rest term does not depend on @xmath17 and may thus be chosen constant .",
    "our recent detailed analyses of scalar mesons have actually been performed in the approximation of formula  ( [ partialpshifta ] ) .    in fig .",
    "( [ cs ] ) we show how the model s cross section varies with @xmath18 in the approximation given in eq .",
    "( [ partialpshifta ] ) , using harmonic - oscillator confinement . the first two plots ( @xmath25 0.2 and 0.3 ) show separate peaks , not very different from a sum of bw resonances . for larger values of @xmath18 ,",
    "the cross section gets more and more distorted , certainly not suited for a description in terms of separate or overlapping bw resonances .",
    "the physical value for the strength of the transition potential comes in our model at around @xmath26 , for which value we find a broad structure peaking at some 830 mev , representing the recently confirmed @xcite @xmath27(800 ) ( or @xmath28 ) resonance .",
    "note that the latter structure is already showing up for smaller coupling , and is clearly not related to the ground state of the @xmath21 @xmath29 confinement spectrum , at 1.389 gev for the model parameters from ref .",
    "@xcite .    the plots for @xmath26 and @xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ cs ] show structures in the scattering cross section that are certainly not well approximated by sums over bw resonances .",
    "nevertheless , expression  ( [ partialpshift ] ) has several features in common with bw resonances .",
    "a bw resonance is characterized by a singularity in the lower - half of the complex - energy plane ( second riemann sheet for single - channel scattering ) .",
    "the real part @xmath31 and the imaginary part @xmath32 of the pole are about equal to the central resonance position and half the width of the resonance , respectively .    in our model , as we have the disposal of an analytic expression , given in eq .",
    "( [ partialpshift ] ) , we can determine the pole positions exactly .",
    "for small values of @xmath18 , the relation between the central peak and width of a structure in the cross section can rather well be read from the real and imaginary part of the pole .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath18 , poles of the scattering amplitude are not always close to the corresponding peaking structure in the cross section .",
    "nevertheless , poles are very useful , because they constitute a clean tool to relate phenomena of different hadronic systems @xcite . for example , only through the hypothetical movements of the poles in the complex - energy plane we can show that the @xmath33(600 ) , @xmath33(980 ) , @xmath27(800 ) @xcite and @xmath34(980 ) are manifestations of the same phenomenon , but for different flavors @xcite .",
    "the scalar mesons represent the most noteworthy result @xcite of the unitarized model given in formula  ( [ scatteqn ] ) . in the recent past ,",
    "scalar mesons have been the subject of many investigations , in a variety of approaches .",
    "strong and electroweak interaction properties of scalar mesons were studied in refs .",

    "@xcite , and properties of scalar mesons at finite temperatures in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our understanding of the scalar mesons is based on studying the corresponding pole positions , and their movements as a function of the coupling @xmath18 . a pole which stems from a confinement state moves towards the energy eigenvalue of that state when @xmath18",
    "is changed to smaller values .",
    "however , we observe that besides the poles stemming directly from the confinement spectrum , there exist poles in the scattering amplitude which disappear into the background for vanishing @xmath18 .",
    "these somehow originate in the bulk of the sum over the radial excitations in expression  ( [ partialpshift ] ) , and are not related to any state in particular .    moreover , we observe that the lightest @xmath35 @xmath36 scalar mesons can only reside somewhere between 1.3 and 1.5 gev in the confinement spectrum , with the model parameters of ref .",
    "the latter have been adjusted to bottomonium , charmonium , the light vector states , and to @xmath37-wave meson - meson scattering data , whenever available in the early eighties .    finally , we observe that the extra poles in the scattering amplitude come close enough to the real - energy axis only in the case of @xmath4-wave scattering .",
    "there , they show up somewhere close to the lowest threshold , for energies below the ground states of the confinement spectrum .    for the physical value of the model parameter @xmath18 , a specific value has been selected by nature .",
    "but in our model we can vary @xmath18 . this way",
    ", we can find out where poles are moving for smaller or larger values of the coupling .",
    "for @xmath2 elastic @xmath4-wave scattering , we adopt the same expression that has been used for @xmath38 as described in ref .",
    "we only have to substitute the confinement masses of @xmath39 by those for @xmath1 , thereby using the parameters of ref .  @xcite . for the ground state of the @xmath21 @xmath1 confinement spectrum ,",
    "the mass comes out at 2.545 gev .",

    "( [ partialpshifta ] ) we approximate by a constant , normalized to 1",
    ". the relative couplings of the ground state and the first radial excitation to the @xmath2 channel are 1.0 and 0.2 , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath40    for expression  ( [ partialpshifta ] ) with the substitution  ( [ dkswave ] ) , and furthermore for the physical value of @xmath18 ( meaning the value fitting @xmath38 elastic @xmath4-wave scattering from threshold up to 1.6 gev @xcite ) , we depict the resulting @xmath2 elastic @xmath4-wave cross section in fig .",
    "the corresponding pole positions in the complex - energy plane for the @xmath41 ground state and first radial excitation are shown in ref .",
    "these are found at 2.28 gev and ( @xmath42 ) gev , respectively .",
    "notice from fig .",
    "[ ds ] that in the region around 2.55 gev , where quark models predicted @xmath21 @xmath1 states @xcite , we find no structure in the cross section , nor poles in the scattering amplitude . on the contrary , employing confinement _ plus _ unitarization , we find structures in the cross section some 250 mev below and 400 mev above that value , which explains the observation of the ( probable ) @xmath41 ground state below the @xmath2 threshold , and predicts for the first radial excitation a resonance somewhere between 2.8 and 3.0 gev , with a width of some 100200 mev . based on fig .",
    "[ ds ] , we may also predict the scattering length for @xmath2 elastic @xmath4-wave scattering . keeping in mind",
    "that the @xmath21 @xmath1 ground state comes out a little bit too low in mass with our value of @xmath18 , we estimate the theoretical error by varying @xmath18 . for a conservative choice , we obtain _ _",
    "the two most important aspects of strong interactions for hadrons are confinement and ozi - allowed real or virtual decay , which effectively describe gluonic interactions and quark - pair creation / annihilation , respectively .",
    "these are the only ingredients entering the model defined in eq .",
    "( [ scatteqn ] ) , which , with a fixed small set of parameters , can reasonably describe hadronic phenomena ranging in energy from the light scalars up to bottomonium .    here",
