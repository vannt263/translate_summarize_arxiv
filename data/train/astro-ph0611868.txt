    "stars are the most visible building blocks of galaxies . hence , knowledge of the ages and chemical compositions of a galaxy s stellar populations can yield insights into its formation and evolution and the astrophysical processes involved .",
    "studies seeking to understand disk galaxy evolution typically use integrated colors of large samples of galaxies at various redshifts to infer mean ages and metallicities . however , integrating the light from all the stars in an entire galaxy or any portion of a galaxy can reduce information while increasing uncertainties .",
    "that is why it is important to more fully understand nearby systems whose stellar contents we can directly resolve .",
    "such systems provide benchmarks for their more distant , unresolved counterparts .",
    "an example of such a system is m33 , the third most massive galaxy in the local group .",
    "in addition to being one of the most common types of spirals in the universe ( de vaucouleurs 1963 ) , it is also the only other known spiral in the local group besides the galaxy and m31 . therefore , understanding m33 s evolution is an important step towards understanding the evolution of spiral galaxies in general .    unlike its larger ,",
    "more massive spiral counterparts in the local group , m33 has a late - type morphology ( hubble type of scd ) . like",
    "many late - type spirals , it has a relatively low dark halo virialized mass of @xmath6 ( corbelli 2003 ) and high total gas mass fraction of @xmath7 ( garnett 2002 ; corbelli 2003 ) .",
    "some empirical and theoretical studies predict such galaxies to have evolutionary histories different from those of earlier morphological types ( e.g. , scannapieco & tissera 2003 ; garnett 2002 ; ferreras et al .  2004 ;",
    "dalcanton et al .  2004 ; heavens et al .",
    "hence , m33 potentially provides a contrasting view of galaxy evolution to that provided by the galaxy and m31 .",
    "the outer disks of spiral galaxies are unique environments for several reasons .",
    "they are often characterized by warps , flares , and other effects of gas infall or gravitational interactions with nearby galaxies .",
    "the disk gravitational potential is relatively shallow and the spiral features weak compared to the inner disk .",
    "moreover , hi has a low column density but dominates the total baryonic mass .",
    "what processes affect the star formation rates in such environments ?",
    "some possibilities include galactic winds , inflow of gas onto the disk , interactions with neighbors , density waves , rotational shear , and viscous radial gas flows .",
    "ferguson et al .  ( 1998 ) discovered hii regions organized in spiral arms out to 2 optical radii in three late - type disk galaxies .",
    "the recent discovery of extended uv disks in several galaxies further raises the importance of spiral structure in driving star formation in the outer regions of these galaxies ( gil de paz et al .",
    "in addition , the uv and cosmic - ray backgrounds as well as feedback from massive stars could be more important regulators of star formation in the tenuous gas of outer disks than in inner disks where dense molecular cores are readily shielded from dissociation and ionization .",
    "the stellar populations in the outskirts of disk galaxies can contain important clues to the interplay between these processes .",
    "furthermore , they tell us about the galactic collapse history , conditions in the early halo , and the progression of subsequent star formation ( freeman & bland - hawthorne 2002 ) . for example , the disk truncation seen in optical surface photometry of many galaxies could be associated with a critical gas density for star formation ( e.g. , naab & ostriker 2006 ) or the maximum specific angular momentum of the baryons before the protogalactic cloud collapsed ( e.g. , van der kruit 1987 ; pohlen et al .  2000 ; de grijs et al .",

    "the present paper is a natural follow - up to paper i because we use deeper photometry obtained with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) that enables a more comprehensive examination of stellar ages , metallicities , and spatial distribution in m33 s outer regions . in a companion paper ( barker et al .",

    ", it was necessary to multiply the flt images by the pixel area maps provided on the stsci website .",
    "since these fields were sparsely populated , there were not enough bright stars to produce a point - spread function ( psf ) with a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "we found that psf photometry resulted in color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) with features that were more clearly defined than those resulting from small aperture photometry .    for each m33 field we first used source extractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to identify sources , daophot to measure aperture magnitudes , and allstar to measure psf magnitudes .",

    "the standard deviation of each group of offsets was @xmath25 mag while the standard error of the mean was @xmath22 mag .",
    "we applied the appropriate cte corrections following the prescription in riess & mack ( 2004 ) .",
    "these corrections were usually @xmath26 mag .    to convert the aperture magnitudes to the standard @xmath27 system , we used the theoretical transformation of sirianni et al .",
    "these authors quote an uncertainty of 0.05 mag for this transformation which we adopt as the uncertainty in the photometric zero - point in the present study .    to reduce spurious detections ( e.g. incompletely masked cosmic rays , background galaxies , noise , etc .",
    ") we made cuts on the final catalog according to the following criteria .",
    "an object was kept if it was detected on all cr - split exposures , if @xmath28 of the median @xmath29 at its magnitude , @xmath30 of the median @xmath31 at its magnitude , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 times the median @xmath34 at its magnitude .",

    "we ran a series of extensive artificial star tests to accurately estimate the photometric errors and completeness rates . for each field , we generated two catalogs of artificial stars with known magnitudes .",
    "the magnitudes in the first catalog were chosen to mimic the observed distribution of stars in the cmd .",
    "regions with no observed stars were assigned a minimum number of artificial stars to fully cover the cmd .",
    "the second catalog was compiled from the unscattered magnitudes of the model stars making up the synthetic cmds described in paper iii .",

    "the artificial stars were inserted into the original frames using the same psfs that we used to photometer the original frames .",
    "we placed the stars on a regular grid such that the spacing between them was 2.1 psf fitting radii ( 42 pixels ) .",
    "this distance was chosen as a compromise between the requirement that the artificial stars not change the crowding conditions and the need for high computing efficiency .",
    "to fully sample the psfs , we randomly varied the starting position of the grid and allowed for sub - pixel positions .",

    "our experience has been that the former is superior in computational efficiency but the latter is superior in photometric depth . since the wfpc2 exposure times are relatively short the extra photometric depth gained by using daophot was not worth the extra computational time .",
    "photometry was obtained following the cookbook procedure in the hstphot manual . in summary ,",

    "then hstphot was run with individual filter and total detection thresholds of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "we enabled the options to refit sky and perform a weighted psf fit which gives the central psf pixels more weight during the fitting . to reduce spurious detections in the final catalogs we required @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . even after these cuts we had to remove 72 , 154 , and 30 stars from the catalogs which were artifacts from the diffraction spikes of bright foreground stars .",

    "the mean color error at i @xmath54 24 is only @xmath66 mag while the width of the ms at this magnitude is @xmath67 mag .",
    "this indicates an intrinsic color spread to the ms which could be due to a spread in metallicity , age , reddening or some combination thereof . a metallicity spread alone would have to be several tenths of a dex because the ms for [ m / h ] @xmath60 0.2 is only @xmath54 0.06 mag redder at i @xmath60 24.0 than that for [ m / h ] @xmath60 0.7",
    "there is evidence for an age spread in the ms because a single age can not simultaneously account for the bright ms turn - off and the presence of the rsg sequence extending from the top - left of the rc .",

    "these two ages are , respectively , the approximate maximum and minimum possible ages for first ascent rgb stars and are constrained by the age of the universe and the time at which the rgb phase transition occurs ( ferraro et al .  1995 ; barker et al .",

    "these limits are very approximate as we have only used the central 68% of the rgb stars .",
    "in addition , the presence of agb stars could cause an underestimate of the metallicity because they lie just to the left of first - ascent rgb stars of the same age and metallicity .",

    "this indicates that a similar intermediate - age population exists in the other fields , as well .",
    "this fact does not rule out the presence of older ages because as can be seen in the figure stars are observed throughout the entire region spanned by the models . furthermore , the rc is biased toward younger ages because the core helium burning lifetime decreases with age ( girardi & salaris 2001 ) .",
    "indeed , there is also a sequence of stars extending from the rc toward bluer colors and fainter magnitudes which lies just above the 12 gyr point on the [ m / h ] @xmath60 1.3 curve .",
    "with such few stars it is hard to say whether it is just a random grouping or the horizontal branch ( hb ) of an older and more metal - poor population .",

    "because of its magnitude and color range , the young ms makes it difficult to confirm or rule out completely the presence of a blue hb tail in m33 similar to that of m92 .",
    "however , it appears that any such population is likely to be a small fraction of the total core helium burning population at the present epoch since there is no significant overdensity of stars on the ms as would be expected from such a feature superposed on the ms .",

    "such measurements could require large areas to obtain a statistically significant sample of rgb stars .",
    "finally , there are several important considerations to note while examining fig .",
    "[ fig : z_grad ] .",
    "first , we have used our fiducial m33 distance , inclination , and position angle and the centers of the fields studied to determine their deprojected distances . because the d03 , b04 , and g04 fields were relatively large , it would be more accurate to plot their positions according to the mean ra and dec of the rgb stars in their fields . depending on the geometry of their fields relative to m33 s nucleus , this could have the effect of moving them inward to smaller radii because of the negative stellar density gradient .",
    "most importantly , all of the measurements presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : z_grad ] compared m33 s rgb stars to the ggcs which are old ( @xmath130 gyr ) and contain enhancements in the @xmath131-element abundance ( @xmath132 \\sim 0.3 $ ] ) . as pointed out by salaris & girardi ( 2005 ) ,",
    "the rgbs of galaxies with composite stellar populations , such as the lmc and smc , are often dominated by stars significantly younger than the ggcs with @xmath132 \\sim 0.0 $ ] .",
    "hence , the metallicities of such systems derived using the ggcs as fiducials could be underestimated by several tenths of a dex .",
    "indeed , in paper iii we model the star formation history of fields a1   @xmath52   a3 using stellar evolutionary tracks with @xmath132 = 0.0 $ ] and we find that the true metallicity is @xmath133 dex higher but the metallicity gradient through the fields is roughly unchanged . from the girardi et al .",
    "isochrones we estimate that approximately half of this offset is due to the lower @xmath131-element abundance and half is due to a younger mean age ( @xmath134 gyr ) .",
    "if the outer regions were as young as 2 gyr , the total offset would amount to @xmath135 dex .",
    "currently there is no information on the star formation history of m33 s inner disk so it is possible the rgb metallicity gradient over its _",
    "disk is shallower or steeper .",
    "however , it is unlikely that an age gradient can mimic the apparent metallicity difference of @xmath136 dex between m33 s central and outer regions because the latter are not young enough .",
    "it has been observed that many spiral galaxies exhibit a sharp drop in star formation across their disks , as measured by the surface brightness of the @xmath137 recombination line .",
    "the location of this drop , @xmath138 , often occurs close to where the gas surface density falls below a theoretically defined critical density required for star formation .",
    "the nature and dependence of this threshold density on the local environment is not exactly clear .",
    "kennicutt ( 1989 ) and martin & kennicutt ( 2001 ) argue that it is governed by gravitational instability as parameterized by the toomre q parameter .",
    "this parameter depends on the local epicyclic frequency and gas velocity dispersion .",
    "it accurately predicts the critical radius for many high surface brightness galaxies but fails for some low - mass spirals like m33 ( @xmath139 ) where large portions of the disk are below the threshold gas density but actively forming stars .",
    "corbelli ( 2003 ) used measurements of the gas kinematics in m33 to derive an extensive rotation curve and mass model .",
    "she found that the toomre criterion could correctly predict @xmath138 in m33 if the surface density of either the stellar disk or dark matter was added to the gas density .",
    "alternatively , a stability criterion based on the shear rate with a low gas velocity dispersion could also correctly predict @xmath138 .",
    "however , such a modified criterion does not work as well for most other galaxies ( martin & kennicutt 2001 ) .",
    "what implications do our results have for the star formation threshold in m33 ? we noted in ",
    "[ sec : cmds ] that field a1 contains stars @xmath140 while a2 and a3 contain stars @xmath141 .",
    "these massive stars can be no older than their ms lifetimes of @xmath142 myr and unless we have coincidentally observed them at the end of their ms phases then they are probably even younger .",
    "this fact is direct evidence for recent star formation at @xmath143 in apparent disagreement with m33 s star formation threshold radius of @xmath144 .",
    "it is possible that these massive stars actually formed at smaller radii and have since migrated outward . given their young ages , however , there probably has not been sufficient time for this to occur .",
    "could star formation be ongoing today in our fields ?",
    "boissier et al .  (",
    "2006 ) used galex images to study the radial variation of star formation in 43 spiral galaxies .",
    "included in their sample was m33 whose far - uv profile extended out to @xmath145 , well past the threshold radius measured with @xmath137 .",
    "indeed , nearly all of the galaxies in their sample displayed similar behavior leading to the conclusion that star formation is ongoing today in the outskirts of these galaxies but at levels too low to produce any ionizing stars .",
    "the uv continuum , however , is sensitive to the star formation rate integrated over the last 100 myr .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath137 observations trace the star formation rate over the last 20 myr ( kennicutt 1998 ) . therefore , it is possible that there are no ionizing stars alive today because star formation ended @xmath146 myr ago .",
    "this latter sencario could explain our observations of young stars in m33 s outskirts beyond the @xmath137 threshold radius and , therefore , save the applicability of the toomre q parameter to m33 .",
    "however , we would still need to explain how star formation could have occurred at all so recently despite the low disk densities in these regions .",
    "was the disk density in the recent past above the threshold density ? to answer this we need to know the current densities of the gas , stars , and dark matter .    according to the tilted - ring model of corbelli ( 2003 ) the azimuthally averaged hi column density is @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 at the central radii of fields a1 , a2 , and a3 , respectively .",
    "complexities in the hi distribution can cause systematic and random errors when performing azimuthal averages even in detailed tilted - ring models .",
    "such is the case in m33 s outer disk where residuals between the model and observed flux at different position angles within a ring can vary by a factor of @xmath84 ( corbelli & schneider 1997 ) .",
    "azimuthally averaged column densities are what are commonly reported in the literature for other galaxies so we use them here as well .",
    "the high resolution aperture synthesis map of newton ( 1980 ) shows that the hi density throughout our fields is below the lowest contour which corresponds to @xmath150 .",
    "the amount of molecular gas in our fields is difficult to ascertain but it is unlikely to contribute significantly to the total gas content .",
    "our fields lie outside the gmc survey of engargiola et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and are at the limit of the sensitivity and coverage of the co maps presented by heyer et al .",
    "the outermost reliable point in their map is at @xmath151 where the @xmath152 column density is @xmath153 .",
    "this can be taken as a rough upper limit for our fields considering that the co to @xmath152 conversion factor may be different in the outer disk where the metallicity is lower .    a crucial point to consider",
    "is whether the gas density in our fields could have been significantly greater just a few hundred myr ago . this possibility is actually ruled out by the low star formation rate required to explain the small number of young , massive stars observed . from the star formation histories calculated in paper iii , we find that the mean star formation rate in the past 400 myr has been @xmath154 .",
    "thus , no more than @xmath155 could have been converted to stars in that time .",
    "corbelli ( 2003 ) calculated the variation in the threshold density with radius in m33 . according to her plots ,",
    "the toomre criterion predicts a threshold disk density that drops from @xmath156 to @xmath157 across fields a1   @xmath52   a3 whereas the shear rate criterion predicts a threshold that is approximately constant at @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , a few hundred myr ago the gas density was below either threshold .",
    "corbelli s mass model predicts the gas to dominate the baryonic mass in these outer regions so it is also unlikely that the stellar mass contributes significantly to the total disk surface density . on the other hand ,",
    "the dark matter density within the disk is about equal to the gas density .",
    "hence , including dark matter in the total disk density can explain the recent star formation in field a1 but not a2 or a3 .",
    "a growing body of evidence has suggested that a _ constant _ threshold gas density of @xmath159 describes the extent of star forming disks equally well if not better than a radially varying threshold like the toomre q parameter or shear rate criterion ( skillman 1987 ; taylor et al .",
    "1994 ; ferguson et al .  1998",
    "; martin & kennicutt 2001 ) . the physical basis for such a threshold",
    "could be related to the minimum pressure needed for the formation of a cold gas phase in the ism ( elmegreen & parravano 1994 , schaye 2004 ) .",
    "if such a constant threshold applies to m33 then our results imply it is @xmath160 and could be as small as @xmath161 . indeed , boissier et al .",
    "( 2006 ) trace m33 s far - uv profile out to gas densities of @xmath162 .",
    "we now return to our finding that the stellar scale length increases with age .",
    "this result raises several interesting questions .",
    "does this reflect something fundamental about m33 s collapse history ?",
    "does it arise from the progression of star formation on galactic scales ? or is it a by - product of subsequent dynamical processes which act to redistribute stars after they are formed ?    in the common picture of inside - out galaxy formation",
    "the scale length of all stars and stellar remnants increases as the disk builds up to the present day size ( e.g. naab & ostriker 2006 ) .",
    "this means that the oldest stars we observe today should have the smallest scale length in contrast to our results which show the opposite trend in m33 .",
    "this seems to suggest an outside - in formation scenario .",
    "a different interpretation is that we are observing a transition between two distinct components in m33 , like a disk / thick - disk or disk / halo .",
    "this would explain why the number of rgb stars in field w3 is larger than predicted by a simple exponential plus constant model .",
    "if this is correct , then field a3 could have a non - negligible thick - disk / halo component which might explain why its metallicity is close to that of m33 s halo .",
    "interestingly , the m - star profile measured by rowe et al .",
    "( 2005 ) shows a flattening at approximately the same location as fields a2 @xmath52 a3 further hinting at a second , more extended component .",
    "m33 s halo was recently isolated kinematically by mcconnachie et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who analyzed keck deimos spectra of 280 stars located @xmath163 along the major axis .",
    "these authors found evidence for three distinct kinematic components : a disk , halo , and an intermediate component which they hypothesized could be a tidal stream in m33 .",
    "it is unclear how the intermediate component would affect our results because , if it is a stream , it might not go through our fields .",
    "the halo component , however , would be present in our fields although it s precise contribution is uncertain .",
    "our fields lie at about the same deprojected distance as those observed by mcconnachie et al .",
    "but they are on the minor axis so the halo - to - disk ratio could be larger depending on the true halo density distribution .",
    "complicating the picture is the possibility of disk orbital heating mechanisms .",
    "these processes must , at some level , modify the stellar age , metallicity , and density gradients put in place by star formation regardless of whether it progresses inside - out or vice - versa .",
    "( e.g. , l@xmath164pine et al .",
    "2003 , sellwood & binney 2002 , wielen et al .",
    "the classical mechanism involves gravitational encounters between stars and giant molecular clouds of mass @xmath165 ( spitzer & schwarzschild 1953 ) .",
    "this process has been shown to heat the stellar disk at a rate where the vertical and radial velocity dispersions are related by @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 ( lacey 1984 , villumsen 1985 ) .",
    "unfortunately , observations in the galaxy indicate that 1 ) there are too few gmcs with the requisite mass ( lacey 1984 ) , 2 ) @xmath169 ( wielen 1977 ) , and 3 ) @xmath170 ( h@xmath171nninen & flynn 2002 ) . in response ,",
    "other mechanisms have been proposed , from heating by spiral arms to massive halo black holes passing through the disk ( lacey & ostriker 1985 ) .",
    "the former is most promising because theoretical simulations predict @xmath172 for the resulting heating rate ( de simone et al .",
    "it s biggest problem , though , is that spiral waves have no effect on the heating rate in the vertical direction and , thus , can not explain why the heating rate has the same time dependence in the radial and vertical directions .",
    "it now appears that some combination of these processes takes place with spiral waves doing most of the heating and gmcs redistributing some of the radial peculiar velocities into the vertical direction ( e.g. , carlberg 1987 ) .",
    "the precise relative contributions could depend on the characteristics of the galaxy in question , like the mass spectrum of gmcs and the strength , number , pitch angle , and lifetime of spiral arms and other irregularities in the potential like bars and accreted satellites .",
    "an important piece of the puzzle comes from seth et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . after analyzing the _ vertical _ distribution of stars in six late - type spirals they found that the scale height increases for successively older stellar populations in a manner such that the power - law exponent @xmath173 .",
    "for an isothermal disk , the vertical scale height is proportional to the vertical velocity dispersion .",
    "seth et al .  used this proportionality to show that if orbital diffusion is responsible for their results then the heating rate in the vertical direction must be significantly less than in the galaxy , namely @xmath174 .",
    "these results are intriguingly similar to what we have found in m33 for the _ radial _ direction and point to a common origin in all late - type spirals .",
    "we have presented deep vi photometry of three fields in m33 s outskirts at deprojected radii of @xmath175 visual scale lengths .",
    "the cmds reveal a mixed stellar population with ages ranging from @xmath176 myr to at least several gyr .",
    "the presence of such young stars so far out in this galaxy is consistent with a low global star formation threshold . assuming our fields are representative of all position angles at similar deprojected radii in m33",
    ", we argue that the threshold can not be significantly more than the present - day azimuthally averaged gas surface density of @xmath177 which is roughly consistent with , but on the low end of , theoretical expectations and previous measurements in other galaxies .",
    "the metallicity gradient as inferred by comparing the observed rgbs to the ggcs is consistent with m33 s inner disk gradient traced by several other studies .",
    "the radial surface density of rgb stars declines exponentially with a scale length of @xmath5 .",
    "the scale length increases with age in a roughly power - law fashion with an exponent that is constrained to be @xmath106 .",
    "this behavior is similar to that found for the vertical scale height in a sample of late - type spiral galaxies like m33 ( seth et al .",
    "we are unable to say whether this behavior is due to the orbital diffusion of stars as they age or to intrinsic variations in star formation history with radius .",
    "given the exponential radial distribution , metallicity gradient , and mixed ages present in our fields it is likely they belong predominantly to m33 s disk .",
    "this would mean that m33 s disk extends out to at least @xmath178 kpc , or @xmath179 v - band scale lengths .",
    "however , we can not rule out the presence of a small , extended component like a thick - disk or halo particularly in the outermost field .",

    "<S> studying the stellar populations in the outskirts of spiral galaxies can provide important constraints on their structure , formation , and evolution . to that end , we present vi photometry obtained with the advanced camera for surveys for three fields located @xmath0 in projected distance southeast of m33 s nucleus ( corresponding to @xmath1 visual scale lengths or @xmath2 kpc in deprojected radius ) . </S>",
    "<S> the color - magnitude diagrams reveal a mixed stellar population whose youngest constituents have ages no greater than @xmath3 myr and whose oldest members have ages of at least several gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of stars as massive as @xmath4 is consistent with global star formation thresholds in disk galaxies but could argue for a threshold in m33 that is on the low end of observational and theoretical expectations . </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity gradient as inferred by comparing the observed red giant branch ( rgb ) to the galactic globular clusters is consistent with m33 s inner disk gradient traced by several other studies . </S>",
    "<S> the surface density of rgb stars drops off exponentially with a radial scale length of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the scale length increases with age in a manner similar to the vertical scale height of several nearby late - type spirals . based on the metallicity gradient , density gradient , and mixed nature of the stellar populations , we conclude these fields are dominated by a disk population although we can not rule out the presence of a small halo component . </S>"
