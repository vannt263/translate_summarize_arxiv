    "towards the end of last year , two experimental groups have independently identified a new type of two - body scattering resonance in an ultracold fermi gas that is composed of neutral @xmath0yb atoms  @xcite .",
    "the possible creation of the so - called orbital interaction - induced feshbach resonances was proposed a few months earlier as a result of the scattering between two ( two - electron ) alkaline - earth atoms in different electronic - orbital and nuclear - spin states  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the more familiar magnetic feshbach resonances , which occur as a result of the coupling between two ( one - electron ) alkali atoms in two different hyperfine states  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that these distinct resonance mechanisms give rise to important implications for the related many - body problems , e.g. , in the contexts of cooper pairing and associated bcs - bec evolution  @xcite .",
    "while a single - band description taking only the open - channel scattering is typically sufficient for the entire evolution across a magnetic resonance  @xcite , a two - band description taking both the open- and closed - channel scatterings on an equal footing is minimally required for an orbital resonance  @xcite .",
    "thus , these new systems naturally break the ground for studies on two - band superfluidity and intrinsic josephson effect in atomic settings with a high degree of precision and control  @xcite .",
    "in particular , depending on the details of the inter - band interactions , one can explore not only the competition between the @xmath1-(in)-phase and @xmath2-(out - of)-phase solutions for the relative phase difference between the intra - band superfluid order parameters , but also the corresponding relative phase fluctuations and the resultant gaussian collective modes around the equilibrium values , i.e. , the phonon - like in - phase goldstone mode and the exciton - like out - of - phase leggett mode  @xcite .    encouraged by the recent realizations of an orbital feshbach resonance in a @xmath0yb fermi gas  @xcite , and unlike the followed up theoretical preprints appeared on uniform systems  @xcite , here we focus on the confinement - induced signatures that can be decisively traced back to the existence of two - band superfluidity in trapped systems . for this purpose , we consider a two - band model under the assumptions of a local - density approximation for the trapping potential and a mean - field approximation for the intra - band cooper pairings .",
    "we find that the interplay between the pair - breaking effect that is caused by the inter - band detuning energy , and the pair - breaking and thermal - broadening effects that are simultaneously caused by the temperature gives rise to non - monotonous evolutions in some physical observables .",
    "in particular to the zero temperature , we also find that while the entire trapped gas is a superfluid for low detunings , a phase separation between the central superfluid core and the outer normal edge consisting only of particles in the lower band eventually appears beyond a detuning threshold that is of the order of the resonance value .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , assuming a local - density approximation for the trapping potential , we introduce a two - band model for the hamiltonian density in real space in sec .",
    "[ sec : lda ] , and relate its bare theoretical parameters to the two - body scattering parameters of @xmath0yb atoms .",
    "then , assuming a mean - field approximation for the intra - band cooper pairings , we derive the mean - field hamiltonian density in sec .",
    "[ sec : mft ] , and obtain a set of self - consistency equations for the intra - band order parameters and number equations for the two bands . having solved these equations numerically in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] and provided a thorough analysis for our findings , we end the paper with a brief summary of our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the semi - classical method based on a local - density approximation for the trapping potential is probably one of the most convenient approaches for studying many - body effects in finite - sized systems . by shifting the confinement potential @xmath3 from the chemical potential @xmath4 ,",
    "one simply introduces a local chemical potential @xmath5 that depends explicitly on the radial distance @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , within this approximation , the hamiltonian density describing isotropically - trapped fermi gases across an orbital feshbach resonance can be written as  @xcite @xmath7 where the band index @xmath8 refers to the particles in the open ( lower band ) and closed ( upper band ) channels with pseudo - spin projections @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is momentum .",
    "the operator @xmath11 creates a single particle at @xmath6 with quantum numbers @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath10 , and dispersion @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is in units of @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is for the lower and @xmath18 is for the upper band , where @xmath19 is assumed to be harmonic in space , and the energy shift @xmath20 between the two bands is a controllable detuning parameter that is used to access an orbital feshbach resonance .",
    "similarly , the operator @xmath21 creates pairs of @xmath22 and @xmath23 particles at @xmath6 with quantum numbers @xmath12 and center - of - mass momentum @xmath24 .",
    "the bare amplitudes for the local intra - band @xmath25 and local inter - band @xmath26 interactions are related to the two - body scattering lengths in vacuum @xmath27 via the usual renormalization relations @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the volume , in such a way that the orbital resonance occurs precisely when @xmath30 is tuned to a critical threshold @xmath31 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "these parameters have recently been determined for a @xmath0yb fermi gas , and are given by @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath34 the bohr radius  @xcite , for which both intra- and inter - band interactions turned out to be attractive with @xmath35 .",
    "assuming that the fluctuations of the pair - creation operators are small in comparison to their equilibrium values , we adopt a mean - field approximation for pairing , and introduce an intra - band order parameter @xmath36 for each band  @xcite , where @xmath37 is a thermal average .",
    "in addition , restricting ourselves solely to local bcs - like solutions , we set @xmath38 and determine the local complex parameter @xmath39 self - consistently with the corresponding local number equation @xmath40 for each band at a given @xmath6 .",
    "once the total number of particles in a given band is obtained by @xmath41 then @xmath4 is iterated until @xmath42 is fixed to a specified value given in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] .",
    "this self - consistent construction is a straightforward extension of the usual mean - field approach that has extensively been employed for single - band fermi gases , and it forms the fundamental basis for most of the bcs - bec crossover studies in the literature , over the past decade or so , in the context of magnetic feshbach resonances  @xcite .",
    "thus , within such a mean - field approximation for the intra - band pairings , the local mean - field hamiltonian can be reexpressed as @xmath43 \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\sum_{ij\\mathbf{q } } u_{ij } \\delta_{i\\mathbf{q}}^*(r ) \\delta_{j\\mathbf{q}}(r ) , % \\label{eqn : mfham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the matrix @xmath44 is the inverse of the amplitude matrix @xmath45 , i.e. , its elements can be written explicitly as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "note that the inter - band coupling gives rise to a josephson - type contribution to the hamiltonian , @xmath51 depending explicitly on the relative phase between the intra - band order parameters .",
    "then , restricting to local bcs - like solutions , the resultant self - consistency equations can be compactly put in a more familiar form as follows  @xcite @xmath52 , \\\\",
    "\\label{eqn : ne } n_i(r ) & = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k } } \\left\\lbrace 1 - \\frac{\\xi_{i \\mathbf{k}}(r)}{e_{i \\mathbf{k}}(r ) } \\tanh \\left[\\frac{e_{i \\mathbf{k}}(r)}{2 t } \\right ] \\right\\rbrace,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the energy of the local quasi - particle excitations in the @xmath12th band with momentum @xmath10 , @xmath54 is the temperature , and the boltzmann constant @xmath55 is set to unity .",
    "the summand in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ne ] ) is the local momentum distribution @xmath56 of particles in the @xmath12th band .",
    "motivated by the success of the analogous mean - field theories in describing the fundamental properties of alkali atoms across a magnetic feshbach resonance  @xcite , here we apply it to alkaline - earth atoms across an orbital feshbach resonance .",
    "therefore , we are interested in the so - called @xmath2-phase solution for the local relative phases between the local order parameters , i.e. , @xmath57 = - \\textrm{sign } [ \\delta_2(r)]$ ] at any given @xmath6 , which is directly linked to the orbital feshbach resonance found in a @xmath0yb fermi gas  @xcite .",
    "we use the following definitions of an effective fermi energy and the associated fermi momentum @xmath58 , and the corresponding thomas - fermi radius @xmath59 in presenting our numerical solutions . assuming a total of @xmath60 non - interacting particles in a single - band fermi gas at @xmath61 , and setting @xmath62",
    ", we may write @xmath63 for the lower band within the local - density approximation . this defines a local fermi momentum @xmath64 in such a way that the local number of particles is given by @xmath65 at a given @xmath6 . noting that @xmath66 at the edge of the system by definition",
    ", we may express @xmath67 , leading to @xmath68 or equivalently @xmath69 .",
    "choosing a typical atomic density @xmath70 at the center of the trap and using the scattering parameters of a @xmath0yb fermi gas given in sec .",
    "[ sec : lda ] , we find @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , by choosing a large momentum cut - off @xmath74 in @xmath10-space sums , we obtain @xmath75-independent solutions for the physical observables , even though all of the bare interaction amplitudes @xmath76 themselves depend explicitly on @xmath75 .",
    "first we consider a resonant fermi gas with @xmath77 , and present typical @xmath78 and @xmath79 profiles as functions of @xmath6 .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that since were are presenting the @xmath2-(out - of)-phase excited - state solutions but not the @xmath1-(in)-phase ground - state ones , the higher @xmath80 band has higher order parameters in spite of its lower density . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : rad](a ) and  [ fig : rad](b ) , while @xmath81 as long as @xmath82 at @xmath61 , and therefore , the entire gas is found to be a superfluid , the pair - breaking effect caused by finite @xmath54 weakens @xmath83 and turns the edge of the gas to normal beyond a critical radius @xmath84 . here",
    ", the critical radius @xmath85 for the superfluid - normal phase separation within the trap is determined by the simultaneous vanishing of @xmath86 .",
    "increasing @xmath54 gradually decreases @xmath85 towards the center of the trap , and eventually the entire gas turns to normal , i.e. , @xmath87 , beyond the critical superfluid - normal transition temperature @xmath88 .",
    "the simultaneous disappearance of the order parameters leads not only to observable cusps in @xmath78 precisely at @xmath89 but also to the thermal broadening of the outer normal regions .",
    "this is best seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad](c ) , where we present the trap - averaged momentum distributions @xmath90 as functions of @xmath91 , where @xmath56 is the summand of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ne ] ) .",
    "we note the following in passing for the radial profiles at @xmath61 .",
    "up until @xmath92 , the local occupation of the upper band in the trap turns out to be non - zero as long as the lower band is also locally occupied there , i.e. if @xmath93 then @xmath94 for any given @xmath6 .",
    "this is a direct result of the inter - band coupling , and the entire gas is a superfluid with @xmath95 wherever @xmath96 , as illustrated above for a resonant fermi gas . on the other hand , when @xmath97 , we find that the inter - band coupling is not locally strong enough to overcome the detuning barrier towards the edge of the gas , as a consequence of which the intra - band pairings vanish @xmath98 simultaneously at some critical radius @xmath85 .",
    "this naturally gives rise to @xmath99 and @xmath93 for @xmath84 , and hence , a phase separation appears between the central superfluid core and the outer normal edge consisting only of particles in the lower band .",
    "when @xmath85 eventually reduces to @xmath1 as @xmath100 then the entire trap is effectively occupied by a single - band of non - interacting fermi gas in the lower band .    to understand the general trends , next we present the band - population imbalance @xmath101 and @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmu](a ) as functions of @xmath30 at @xmath61",
    ". it is clearly seen that while @xmath102 or @xmath103 and @xmath104 at @xmath105 , the particles gradually transfer from the upper to the lower band as a result of the increased energy difference @xmath106 between the bands and its pair - breaking effect , leading eventually to @xmath107 or @xmath108 and @xmath109 in the @xmath100 limit .",
    "the evolutions of @xmath110 and @xmath4 are smooth and monotonous across the resonance , at which point we find @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "similarly , in fig .  [ fig : pmu](b ) , we present @xmath110 and @xmath4 as functions of @xmath54 at @xmath77 .",
    "while @xmath4 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath54 , @xmath110 first increases to a peak value of @xmath113 at @xmath114 and then decreases .",
    "this temperature almost coincides with the critical one where @xmath115 and @xmath116 at @xmath88 .",
    "the non - monotonous evolution of @xmath110 with @xmath54 at fixed @xmath30 is a direct consequence of the competition between the pair - breaking and thermal - broadening effects of @xmath54 . to illustrate this competition , we present the central parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 in figs .",
    "[ fig : res](a ) and  [ fig : res](b ) , respectively , as functions of @xmath54 for a resonant fermi gas .",
    "in accordance with our definition of @xmath119 given above for a non - interacting single - band fermi gas at @xmath61 , the upper band is completely empty for @xmath120 . since @xmath73 in this paper",
    ", @xmath121 promotes some of the particles to the upper band causing @xmath122 at @xmath61 in the first place , and thus , the reduction of @xmath83 at finite but low @xmath123 naturally demotes particles back to the lower band .",
    "however , in the mean time , the particles are thermally excited back to the upper band as well , leading to the aforementioned competition as a function of @xmath54 .",
    "the isolated effects of pair - breaking and thermal - broadening mechanisms on the occupations of the bands are evidently seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : res](c ) , where we present @xmath124 as functions of @xmath54 .    for completeness ,",
    "next we discuss the central parameters @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath125 as functions of @xmath30 at @xmath61 , showing purely the crucial role played by the pair - breaking effect of @xmath30 in the absence of thermal effects . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t0 ] , while @xmath126 and @xmath127 at @xmath105 , the particles gradually transfer from the upper to the lower band with increased @xmath30 due to the simultaneous reduction of @xmath128 .",
    "this eventually leads to @xmath129 and @xmath130 in the @xmath100 limit , and the problem reduces effectively to a single - band of non - interacting fermi gas in the lower band .",
    "we would like to remark here that the physical picture outlined just above in understanding the general trends presented in this paper goes beyond the simple mean - field approximation that is assumed in our numerical calculations .",
    "it is widely believed that while this approximation reliably describes the low - temperature ( @xmath131 ) properties of a weakly - interacting fermi gas in general , the inclusion of ( at least ) the gaussian pair - fluctuations is necessary in order to produce a qualitatively correct @xmath132 in the strongly - interacting regime especially near the resonance  @xcite .",
    "however , the non - monotonous evolutions caused by the competition between the pair - breaking and thermal - broadening mechanisms should be manifested in beyond mean - field calculations as well , apart from expected minor quantitative differences .",
    "in summary , we analyzed how a trapped @xmath0yb fermi gas and its superfluid properties evolve across an orbital feshbach resonance .",
    "we used a two - band description for this purpose , under the assumptions of a local - density approximation for the trapping potential and a mean - field approximation for the intra - band pairings .",
    "one of our primary findings is that the interplay between the pair - breaking effect that is caused by the inter - band detuning energy @xmath30 , and the pair - breaking and thermal - broadening effects that are simultaneously caused by the temperature @xmath54 gives rise to non - monotonous evolutions in some physical observables , including the band - population imbalance and trap - averaged momentum distributions .",
    "in addition , we found at @xmath61 that while the entire trapped gas is a superfluid for @xmath133 with the resonance detuning @xmath134 , a phase separation between the central superfluid core and the outer normal edge which consists only of particles in the lower band eventually appears beyond a critical detuning that is of the order of @xmath97 .",
    "we also argued that , since these predictions are physically intuitive and not caused by any of the approximations used , they may play decisive roles in probing two - band superfluidity in the cold - atom context . as an immediate outlook , we look forward to further research along these lines by especially taking the beyond local - density and/or mean - field corrections into account for quantitatively more accurate predictions .",
