    "during the 1997 fixed - target run at fermilab , nutev received @xmath7 800 gev / c protons with the detector configured for this search .",
    "the proton beam was incident on a one - interaction - length beryllium oxide target at a targeting angle of 7.8 mr with respect to the detector . a sign - selected quadrupole train ( ssqt )  @xcite focused either positive ( for @xmath8 protons ) or negative ( for @xmath9 protons ) secondary @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons into a 440 m evacuated decay region pointed towards the nutev decay channel and neutrino detector hall . surviving neutrinos ( and possibly also @xmath12 s ) traversed @xmath13850 meters of earth - berm shielding before reaching the nutev decay channel .    the decay channel region ( figure  [ fig : dkchannel ] ) , located 1.4 km downstream of the production target , was designed to contain minimal material ( in order to suppress neutrino interactions ) and to have tracking sufficient to isolate two - track decays of neutral particles . a 4.6  m  @xmath14  4.6  m double array of plastic scintillation counters vetoed charged particles entering from upstream of the decay channel .",
    "if two counters in a back - front coincidence fired , the event was vetoed .",
    "timing resolution for the veto system was 3.8 ns .",
    "a nutev testbeam chamber was positioned immediately downstream of the veto wall and offset from the center of the decay channel ; this chamber was not used in this analysis .",
    "the channel itself measured 34 m in length and was interspersed with 3  m  @xmath14  3  m argon - ethane drift chambers positioned at 14.5  m , 24  m , and 34  m downstream of the veto array in stations of 1 , 1 , and 4 chambers , respectively . from upstream to downstream , the chambers were labeled dk5 through dk1 , followed by tg43 at the front face of the neutrino detector .",
    "chambers dk5 through dk2 and tg43 had a single sense wire per cell ( `` single - wire '' chambers ) , resulting in a left - right ambiguity in the hit position .",
    "this ambiguity was reduced in tracking by making use of the fact that the positions of the single - wire chambers were staggered in @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "chamber dk1 was of a `` three - wire '' ( two sense wires and one field - shaping wire per cell ) design , which helped resolve any remaining tracking ambiguities .",
    "dk1 was also rotated by 47.7 mr about the beam axis , allowing tracks in the @xmath15 view to be matched with those in the @xmath16 view .",
    "the regions between the drift chamber stations were occupied by helium - filled cylindrical plastic bags 4.6  m in diameter .    in the offline analysis , tracks were reconstructed from drift chamber hits and grouped together to form vertices .",
    "the tracking algorithm took into account multiple coulomb scattering , using a full error matrix for the fit .",
    "sets of tracks were grouped as candidates for a vertex if their distance of closest approach was less than 12.7 cm .",
    "the vertex position was then determined using a constrained fit .",
    "typically , a vertex from a @xmath0 of mass 5 gev/@xmath6 would be reconstructed with a resolution of 0.13 cm in the transverse direction and 7.4 cm longitudinally .    the lab e neutrino detector  @xcite , located immediately downstream of the decay channel , provided final state particle energy measurement and identification .",
    "this detector consisted of a 690 ton iron - scintillator target calorimeter followed by a toroidal muon spectrometer .",
    "three - wire argon - ethane drift chambers were positioned every 20  cm along the length of the calorimeter , and 84 2.5 cm - thick liquid scintillator counters were interleaved with the steel plates at 10 cm intervals throughout the its length . the spectrometer had a 15 kg toroidal magnetic field with drift chambers interspersed throughout the toroid magnets to provide tracking for the muons .",
    "sets of hits in the calorimeter drift chambers were linked to tracks found within the decay channel to determine the particle identification for each track . by analyzing the distribution of hits in the calorimeter as either single , long tracks ( consistent with a muon ) , as a compact cluster of hits ( consistent with an electron shower ) , or as an elongated cluster of hits ( consistent with a pion shower ) , the particle type was determined .",
    "all charged hadrons were reconstructed as pions ; `` @xmath17 '' samples referred to below are understood to include any @xmath18 or @xmath19 final states as well .",
    "the nutev calibration beam provided electrons , pions , and muons to the lab  e detector ;    ( 8,3.6)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 )    .misreconstruction rates for monte carlo @xmath0 decays [ misid ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in many ways , the three @xmath20 events are consistent with a @xmath12 decay hypothesis .",
    "the events pass the analysis cuts , where the background is estimated to be 0.04 events . as expected for a decay relative to an interaction hypothesis ,",
    "all three events occur well within the fiducial volume away from the chambers and are evenly distributed throughout the decay channel .",
    "the transverse mass , invariant mass , and missing @xmath21 are all consistent with a 5 gev / c@xmath22 @xmath12 decay ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n0dists ] ) .    unlike the background , in both the nhl and neutralino models",
    ", one would expect the @xmath23 rate to be highly suppressed relative to leptonic decays .",
    "however , for a 5 gev / c@xmath22 nhl model , one would expect 1.4 times more @xmath24 events  @xcite .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the observation of no @xmath2 candidates , but neither does it provide direct support . a neutralino model , on the other hand , can accommodate the observation of either only @xmath4 or a combination of @xmath20 and @xmath2 candidates by selecting appropriate couplings .",
    "globally , the events have one feature which is improbable for an @xmath12 decay hypothesis .",
    "figure  [ n0asym ] shows the muon energy asymmetry ( @xmath25)/(@xmath26 ) for the 5 gev / c@xmath22 @xmath12 simulation compared to the three data events .",
    "all three events have a muon energy asymmetry which is greater than 0.85 .",
    "the probability that this occurs in a weak decay hypothesis  @xcite is less than @xmath27 ( including acceptance ) .",
    "individually , there are also particular characteristics to note in two of the events .",
    "event 06133/03846 has relatively poor vertex pseudo-@xmath28/dof ; the probability of an event having a pseudo-@xmath28/dof greater than or equal to this is 5% . in event 6013/219863 ,",
    "three of the four hits in chamber dk4 immediately downstream of the vertex are missing .",
    "the probability of this occurring in a random event is less than @xmath29 .",
    "dk4 had persistent high voltage problems throughout the run and the absence of hits in this chamber may be due to this .",
    "however , we have examined the drift chamber readout string and found no indication that the chamber was misbehaving for this event and we have observed good tracks through this chamber for events proximate in time .",
    "finally , we have discovered some evidence for a `` coherent '' inefficiency , a linked inefficiency between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 views .",
    "such an inefficiency may occur at a level of ( @xmath30)@xmath31 probability , again making the missing of the three hits on the tracks highly unlikely .",
    "this event also has a third track attached to a downstream vertex . to interpret this event as an @xmath0 decay",
    ", the added track must be interpreted as a delta ray .",
    "such an interpretation is consistent with the calorimeter data .",
    "event 5835/81705 does not suffer from reconstruction issues .",
    "interesting limits on the production of nhls and neutralinos can be set that indicate the sensitivity of the decay channel search ; these limits are set by calculating one - sided limits using a frequentist approach without background subtraction . because the source of the events is unclear , the unified approach of feldman and cousins  @xcite has deliberately _ not _ been used .",
    "the limit on nhls reaches mixing parameter values below @xmath32 and is consistent with the results from the delphi experiment at lep  @xcite , as shown on figure  [ nhllim ] .",
    "nutev is the first experiment to set limits on the production of long - lived neutralinos in this mass range which decay by @xmath33-parity violation .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ neutlim ] .",
    "this limit , although motivated by a neutralino hypothesis , is a generic limit applicable for any model of neutral particle production at the target  @xcite .",
    "several aspects of the candidate events are similar to those from neutrino interaction backgrounds , and might be indicative of unaccounted - for sources .",
    "first , all three events occurred during the high rate @xmath34-mode as opposed to @xmath35-mode running periods ; the @xmath34 to @xmath36 event ratio is expected to be 4:1 for all events and 1.5:1 for low - multiplicity events .",
    "second , if the events were produced by neutrino interactions , then one would expect a high energy leading @xmath37 for @xmath34-mode running .",
    "in the two cases where the charge of the leading muon can be measured , the charge is negative .",
    "the event kinematics ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) are consistent with the background simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disdists ] ) and , for dis background , the probability for three events with the observed energy asymmetry is 25  to  @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disasym ] ) .",
    "if these are interpreted as dis events , then the visible ( measured ) squared four - momentum transfer , @xmath42 , for each is 6.4 , 2.5 , and 5.6 gev@xmath43 , respectively .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is difficult to explain these events as neutrino interactions . if all of these events are due to charged - current neutrino interactions in the helium which give a prompt second muon ( charm production , trident production , etc . ) , then the rate is two orders of magnitude greater than predicted by the monte carlo .",
    "if such a source was not included in our simulations , then we would also expect between 10 and 300 additional events at 99% confidence level  @xcite in the chambers and between 30,000 and 220,000 events at 99% confidence level in the calorimeter itself .",
    "we actually see only 2 @xmath20 chamber events in agreement with our monte carlo ( see table  [ data_loose1 ] ) and 54 events with similar kinematics were found in the calorimeter  @xcite . in order to show the difficulty of developing reasonable `` null '' ( background ) hypotheses , we consider three examples below .",
    "the first null hypothesis is that the events were actually prompt @xmath1 events produced in the chambers and misreconstructed in the helium .",
    "if we try to force vertex reconstruction for the two muons in 6013/219863 at the nearest downstream chamber ( dk4 ) , the pseudo-@xmath44 goes from 22.9/10 for the standard fit up to 290.2/11 for the forced fit .",
    "if the third track is also forced to be on the vertex , the pseudo-@xmath44 rises to 323.6/17 . if one does not require the track to be in the chambers , but requires all three tracks to come from the same vertex , then one obtains 217.1/16 .",
    "likewise , event 6133/3846 produces a poor fit to the chambers . for the chamber downstream of the vertex ( dk5 ) ,",
    "the pseudo-@xmath45 is 94,720/18 and for the testbeam chamber upstream it is 543/18 .",
    "these are well above the original fit of 166/17 .",
    "finally , for 5835/81705 , the standard fit gives 6.3/9 which increases to 51.5/10 if forced to be reconstructed in the chamber upstream ( dk4 ) .",
    "aside from the problems of forcing a fit to the chambers , this hypothesis leaves unanswered the questions : 1 ) why are only @xmath1 events misreconstructed , and not @xmath3 or @xmath2 ? and 2 ) what is the source of these excess @xmath46 s ?",
    "a second null hypothesis rejects the idea that the @xmath1 events are prompt , and instead attributes them to unsimulated @xmath47 interactions , where the pion decays to produce the second muon and the other particles in the reaction ( signified by @xmath48 ) are not seen .",
    "this has the advantage of being more plausible than an unexpected source of prompt @xmath1 events , but it suffers from several problems .",
    "first , if these are events which occur in the chambers , then one must explain why the @xmath1 events are misreconstructed in the helium .",
    "the transverse momentum associated with pion decay is very small , so the muon track would generally point back to the original chamber vertex .",
    "for those events which do show an offset , there will be a much higher probability of occurring in the 15.2 to 101.6 cm range than well beyond 101.6 cm , where these events are found .",
    "also , only 7% of the pions will decay within the decay channel so many undecayed @xmath3 events should be observed .",
    "quantitatively , the data in these other channels can be compared to different scalings of the observed three @xmath20 events .",
    "the dis monte carlo predicts a ratio of @xmath17 to @xmath20 events of 3.25 for the sample with all the standard cuts . with this ratio ,",
    "the probability of seeing 3 @xmath20 events and , as observed , 0 @xmath17 is 0.31% .",
    "furthermore , one can scale these @xmath20 events in the helium by the ratio of masses and acceptance for the chambers versus helium and compare to the observed @xmath17 and @xmath20 events seen in chambers with the loosest cuts . given that ratio , the 10 @xmath17 ( 2 @xmath20 ) events observed in the chambers are consistent at a confidence level of only @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) with the hypothesis that the three @xmath20 events in the helium are due to an unaccounted - for @xmath17 source .",
    "it is therefore extremely unlikely that an unsimulated @xmath17 source is responsible for the three @xmath20 events in the helium .",
    "a third null hypothesis is that the candidates are neutrino interactions in the chambers producing a @xmath19 final state followed by a @xmath51 decay that causes the event vertex to be misreconstructed downstream in the helium region .",
    "this process has the advantage that the decay angle is sufficiently large for an event produced in the chambers to reconstruct in the helium .",
    "fits to the three candidate events under this hypothesis show that that the fits are kinematically possible . taking the kaon momenta calculated from the fit , the probabilities are 17.6% , 11.6% and 8.2% for the kaon to decay . because the decay channel tracking is largely located downstream of the decay region , most two - track vertices , including most simulated @xmath0 events , can also be reconstructed as displaced - vertex kaon decays with high quality .",
    "however , the kaon hypothesis does not explain these events for several reasons .",
    "first , direct production is cabibbo - suppressed , so most production is through fragmentation .",
    "direct production is also most likely in @xmath52 running , whereas the events are only seen in @xmath53 running periods .",
    "approximately 20% of events produce kaons through fragmentation , but this occurs mainly in high multiplicity events which would be cut by the `` clean cuts . ''",
    "this process is included in the 0.040 event background estimate , to which it contributes @xmath540.0025 events .",
    "clean events could be produced by diffractive production ; the large angle of the high energy muons in these events , however , is uncharacteristic of diffractive production and the excess is far above expectation ( see table [ backg ] ) .    finally , as with the pion decay hypothesis only a small fraction , 22% , of the kaons from neutrino interactions will decay .",
    "in addition , because kaon decays have large @xmath40 , only 45% of the @xmath55 producing two muons in the calorimeter will have a vertex formed by the two muons . in the other cases , the decay plane is aligned such that the two muons fail to verticize in the decay channel .",
    "( such unaligned dimuon events consistent with all but the vertex cut are not observed in the data . ) as in the case of the pions , we can use scaling arguments to compare the observed data to the predictions of this hypothesis . in the data , there are one @xmath2 and two @xmath17 chamber events with all the standard cuts but with the track energy requirements removed .",
    "the scaling factor is 8.24 between @xmath19 events in the drift chambers and @xmath20 events in the helium . under this hypothesis , the probability to see , as observed , three or fewer @xmath56-hadron events in the chambers given the three @xmath20 events in the helium is 0.37% .",
    "therefore , the paucity of @xmath56-hadron events in the chambers excludes at 99.6% confidence level the possibility of an unsimulated @xmath19 source large enough to explain the three observed @xmath20 events in the helium .",
    "in summary , nutev has observed 3 @xmath1 events , 0 @xmath3 and 0 @xmath2 events with transverse mass above 2.2 gev/@xmath6 .",
    "the expected backgrounds were @xmath5 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 events ( preliminary ) , respectively .",
    "nutev has set new limits on nhl and neutralino decays based on this analysis .",
    "the nhl limits are consistent with the delphi result .",
    "the neutralino results are the first in this kinematic region for the long - lived @xmath59 which decays with @xmath33-parity violation .    in conclusion ,",
    "the rate corresponding to the observed three events is not consistent with standard model processes we have identified and the source of the events is not clear .",
