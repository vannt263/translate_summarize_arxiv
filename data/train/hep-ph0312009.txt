    "over the past years , the zeus  @xcite and h1  @xcite collaborations at hera have been able to observe the photoproduction of large-@xmath4 photons , and the comparisons of data with existing nlo qcd predictions  @xcite appear successful . in photoproduction reactions , a quasi - real photon , emitted at small angle from the electron , interacts with a parton from the proton .",
    "the photon can either participate directly in the hard scattering or be resolved into a partonic system , in which case the parton stemming from the photon takes part in the hard interaction .",
    "therefore photoproduction is a privileged reaction to measure or constrain the parton distributions in the photon and in the proton . in this paper",
    "we shall investigate the possibility to constrain both the gluon in the photon and the gluon in the proton by looking at the production of a large-@xmath4 photon and a jet .",
    "with the aim of enhancing the contribution of processes involving initial gluons , we will explore various kinematical domains in detail .",
    "we shall show that there are kinematical configurations which are dominated either by the gluon in the photon , or by the gluon in the proton , and which should be accessible to experiment .",
    "the photoproduction of large-@xmath4 particles and jets has a long story ; it offers interesting tests of qcd and gives access to the measurement of the initial state parton distributions and the final state fragmentation functions ( for a review , see e.g.  @xcite ) . reactions involving large-@xmath4 jets and/or hadrons have been copiously observed because of their large cross sections , whereas the production of prompt photons has been measured only more recently and the statistical errors are still rather large .",
    "however , this latter reaction has advantages with respect to jet or hadron production .",
    "indeed a large transverse momentum is necessary to unambiguously define a jet and to avoid too large hadronisation and underlying events corrections .",
    "the theoretical predictions also are subject to uncertainties due to scale variations .",
    "all these effects are quite sizeable , even for @xmath5  gev @xcite .",
    "the photoproduction of large-@xmath4 hadrons also suffers from sizeable theoretical uncertainties coming from a large sensitivity to scale variations and from the fragmentation functions which are not very accurately measured @xcite . in the case of a large-@xmath4 photon ,",
    "there is of course no problem due to jet definition , hadronisation or inaccurate fragmentation functions ( only isolated photons are observed ) .",
    "even more importantly , the theoretical predictions are reasonably stable under scale variations .",
    "therefore the photoproduction of prompt photons appears as an ideal reaction to test qcd and measure the non - perturbative inputs .",
    "however one must keep in mind two reserves , one of experimental and another one of theoretical nature .",
    "first , the measured cross sections are small and become rapidly very low at peripheral regions of the phase space which might be physically interesting .",
    "moreover , the detection of a photon among the huge amount of large-@xmath4 @xmath6 s is not an easy task .",
    "second , only isolated photons are observed , the isolation criterion being that very little hadronic energy is contained in a cone surrounding the photon .",
    "this has the advantage of reducing the fragmentation component of the cross section , but at the same time this isolation can eliminate events containing too much hadronic energy coming from the underlying event in the cone , an effect which can not be taken into account in the nlo calculations .",
    "this point has been discussed in @xcite and studied by the h1 collaboration @xcite .    in order to constrain the kinematics of the different subprocesses , it is important to observe a large-@xmath4 jet in association with the photon , which introduces uncertainties in the comparison between data and theory due to hadronisation and underlying event phenomena .",
    "however , the effect of these phenomena can be considerably reduced if the transverse momentum of the jet , which is not well measured , is not used to constrain the kinematics , but only its rapidity .",
    "this is done by using the variables @xmath7 @xcite instead of the commonly used @xmath8 .",
    "we will make an extensive use of the variables @xmath7 for the proton and the photon in order to constrain the kinematical region relevant for the observation of the gluon distributions .",
    "our paper is organised in the following way . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss theoretical issues related to the subsequent numerical studies , such as photon isolation , suitable observables to study the parton distributions and the importance of asymmetric cuts on the minimum transverse energies .",
    "section 3 contains the numerical results , where first the sensitivity to the gluon content of the proton is studied .",
    "then we turn to the gluon distribution in the real photon before we conclude in section 4 .",
    "as the general framework of the calculation already has been described in detail in  @xcite , we will sketch the method only briefly here and focus instead on issues related to the gluon distributions .    in photoproduction ,",
    "the electron acts like a source of quasi - real photons whose spectrum can be described by the weizscker - williams approximation , which we use in the following form @xmath9 as already mentioned , the quasi - real photon then either takes part _ directly _ in the hard scattering process , or it acts as a composite object , being a source of partons which take part in the hard subprocess .",
    "the latter mechanism is referred to as _ resolved _ process and is parametrised by the parton distributions in the photon @xmath10 .",
    "thus the distribution of partons of type `` @xmath11 '' in the electron is a convolution @xmath12 where in the `` direct '' case the parton @xmath11 is the photon itself , i.e. @xmath13 . the parton distributions in the photon @xmath14 behave like @xmath15 for large @xmath16 . therefore the additional power of @xmath17 contained in the `` resolved '' component as compared to the `` direct '' one is compensated .",
    "this means that the nlo corrections to the resolved component can be numerically sizeable and have to be taken into account .",
    "the cross section can symbolically be written as @xmath18 where we have split the hard scattering cross sections @xmath19 explicitly into a `` direct '' and a `` fragmentation '' part in order to point out that there are two contributions to the `` prompt photon '' in the final state : the `` direct '' one , where the final state photon is produced directly in the hard interaction , and the one where the photon stems from the fragmentation of a large-@xmath4 quark or gluon in the final state .",
    "this fragmentation process is described by the fragmentation functions @xmath20 . at",
    "next - to - leading order , the distinction between `` direct '' and `` fragmentation '' becomes scheme dependent because the final state collinear singularity appearing in a `` direct '' process like @xmath21 when a quark becomes collinear to the photon is absorbed at the fragmentation scale @xmath22 into the `` bare '' fragmentation functions , and where to attribute the finite parts is a matter of choice of the factorisation scheme . in our calculation",
    "we use the @xmath23 scheme .",
    "note that the cross section ( [ sigma ] ) depends on three scales , the renormalisation scale @xmath24 , the initial state factorisation scale @xmath25 , and the fragmentation scale @xmath22 , and that it can be considered as consisting of 4 categories of subprocesses , depending on whether there is a `` direct '' photon in the initial and/or final state : 1 .",
    "direct direct , 2 .",
    "resolved direct , 3 .",
    "direct fragmentation , 4 . resolved fragmentation .",
    "each of these contributions consists of several partonic subprocesses at nlo and is strongly scale dependent . only in the sum this scale dependence cancels to a large extent , and",
    "only the sum can be considered as a physical quantity .",
    "this has to be kept in mind when the contributions of certain subprocesses only will be considered below , in order to estimate the contribution of gluon initiated processes .",
    "the study of particular subprocesses can be very useful to get an idea of the underlying parton dynamics , but can not be considered as precise quantitative statements because of the scale and scheme dependence outlined above .",
    "we would like to emphasize that we calculated the full nlo corrections to all four categories of subprocesses .",
    "we also included the quark loop box contribution @xmath26 which is nnlo from a naive @xmath17 power counting point of view , but as the process @xmath26 does not exist at tree level , the box is the `` leading order '' diagram for this process , and its numerical contribution is quite sizeable  @xcite .",
    "the calculation presented in @xcite has no higher order corrections to the resolved - direct , direct - fragmentation and resolved - fragmentation contributions .",
    "it only contains the higher order corrections to the direct - direct part , and the box contribution is also included .      in prompt photon measurements , the experimental challenge consists in the separation of prompt photon events from the large background of secondary photons produced by the decay of light mesons , predominantly @xmath6 mesons .",
    "the latter , when produced at high energy , decay into two almost collinear photons which can not be resolved in the calorimeter .",
    "however , they are in general accompanied by hadronic energy and thus this background can be suppressed by isolation cuts",
    ".    commonly a cone isolation criterion is used , defined in the following way : a photon is isolated if , inside a cone centered around the photon direction in the rapidity and azimuthal angle plane , the amount of hadronic transverse energy @xmath27 deposited is smaller than some value @xmath28 fixed by the experiment : @xmath29 following the hera conventions , we used @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 = 1 .",
    "of course isolation not only reduces the background from secondary photons , but also substantially reduces the fragmentation components , such that the total cross section depends very little on the fragmentation functions .",
    "but another , undesired , effect of isolation is a partial suppression of the direct contribution .",
    "indeed , the hadronic transverse energy @xmath27 deposited in the cone may stem from the soft underlying event due to the spectator - spectator collisions .",
    "this renders the effective isolation cut more stringent and leads to a decrease of the cross section , included the direct contributions .",
    "the simulation of this effect , discussed in @xcite , requires a good knowledge of the hadron distributions in the underlying event , which is asymmetric in @xmath33 collisions ; it has been studied in recent h1 publications @xcite .      as observables which serve to reconstruct the longitudinal momentum fraction of the parton stemming from the proton respectively photon ,",
    "it is common to use x_obs^p= , x_obs^= .",
    "[ xobs ] however , as the measurement of @xmath34 can be a substantial source of systematic errors at low @xmath35 values , we propose a slightly different variable which does not depend on @xmath34 , x_ll^p,=. [ xll ] at leading order , for the non - fragmentation contribution , the variables @xmath8 and @xmath7 coincide , and they are also equal to the `` true '' partonic longitudinal momentum fraction , i.e. the argument of the parton distribution function . at nlo ,",
    "the real corrections involve 3 partons in the final state ( with transverse momenta @xmath36 ) , one of which  say parton 5  is unobserved .",
    "therefore , @xmath8 and @xmath7 will be different at nlo .",
    "r[0.cm]10.7 cm    the difference between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is rather small in the proton case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ xobsll]a ) . in the photon case ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are very similar in the region @xmath39 . however , for @xmath40 close to one , there are important differences between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the former leading to a smoother distribution @xmath41 if the size of the bins around @xmath42 is not chosen too small ( see fig .",
    "[ xobsll]b ) .",
    "it is well known@xcite that symmetric cuts on the minimum transverse energies of dijets or a photon plus a jet should be avoided as they amount to including a region where the fixed order perturbative calculation shows infrared sensitivity .",
    "as explained in detail in  @xcite , the problem stems from terms @xmath43 which become large as @xmath44 approaches @xmath45 , the lower cut on the jet transverse energy .",
    "therefore the partonic nlo cross section has a singular behaviour at @xmath46 , which is displayed in fig .",
    "[ etmin ] . of course , analogously , there are @xmath47 terms which become large for @xmath48 , see fig .",
    "[ largebin ] .",
    "r[0.cm]9 cm    the comparison with data can be done in two ways .",
    "first , if one wants to display e.g. the differential cross section @xmath49 while @xmath50 lies within the considered @xmath51 range , the binning in @xmath51 must be chosen large enough to average over the logarithmic singularity which is integrable .",
    "for instance , the binning @xmath52 with @xmath53gev for the bin around @xmath54gev in fig .",
    "[ largebin ] should lead to a correct average of the theoretical singularity and allow for a comparison with data .",
    "obviously , @xmath55 will not exhibit a problem as long as @xmath56 since the critical point @xmath57 will not be reached in this case .",
    "second , one often would like to have a more inclusive cross section such as @xmath58 , obtained by integrating the differential cross section over @xmath44 and @xmath51 . in this case",
    "one should not choose @xmath59 as this amounts to integrating the spectrum of fig .",
    "[ largebin ] to the right - hand side of @xmath50 only and thus to picking up only the singular negative contribution to the nlo cross section , without the compensation coming from the positive contribution to the left of @xmath50 . as a result , the theoretical prediction , although being finite , is infrared sensitive as a consequence of choosing symmetric cuts .",
    "this point has been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ etajet ] , where we consider the cross section @xmath60 in a kinematic range studied by h1 . to exhibit the effect of different cuts on @xmath61 , we vary @xmath45 to take the values 4 , 4.5 or 5 gev , while @xmath50 has been fixed to 5 gev , and display direct and resolved parts separately .",
    "note that the leading order prediction is the same for all three values of @xmath45 as @xmath61 can not become smaller than @xmath50 at leading order .",
    "one observes that in the direct part at small rapidities , the higher order corrections are large and negative . in the case of symmetric cuts , they are even negative in the resolved part at small rapidities , and the theoretical prediction depends strongly on the small change in @xmath45 from 5 gev to 4.5 gev , whereas away from the symmetric cut region , the prediction is much more stable under small changes of @xmath45 .",
    "l[0.cm]10.2 cm    in summary , we repeat that for a successful comparison of data and nlo theory , one has to either ensure to stay away from ir singular domains or to consider suitably averaged observables . in what concerns the cuts on @xmath62 and @xmath63 ,",
    "this amounts to choosing asymmetric cuts adapted to the observable .",
    "therefore we disagree with the statement made in  @xcite that asymmetric cuts are not superior to symmetric ones .",
    "our studies are based on the program ephox , which is a partonic monte carlo event generator . unless stated otherwise , we use the following input for our numerical results : a center of mass energy @xmath64gev with @xmath65gev and @xmath66gev is used",
    ". the cuts on the minimum transverse energies of photon and jet are @xmath67gev , @xmath68gev .",
    "the rapidities have been integrated over in the domain @xmath69 unless stated otherwise . for the parton distributions in the proton",
    "we take the mrst01  @xcite parametrisation , for the photon we use afg04  @xcite distribution functions and bfg  @xcite fragmentation functions .",
    "we take @xmath70 flavours , and for @xmath71 we use an exact solution of the two - loop renormalisation group equation , and not an expansion in log@xmath72 .",
    "the default scale choice is @xmath73 .",
    "jets are defined using the @xmath74-algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the rapidities refer to the @xmath75 laboratory frame , with the hera convention that the proton is moving towards positive rapidity .      as explained already in section [ intro ] , an accurate knowledge of the gluon distribution in the proton is very important at the lhc because of its large gluon luminosity . at present",
    "the error on important cross sections at the lhc stemming from the gluon pdfs is about 5 - 7% , but can be up to 20% in certain cases . therefore our aim is to find a region where 1 ) the sensitivity to the gluon in the proton is enhanced , 2 ) @xmath76 is rather large , 3 ) the uncertainty stemming from the poorly known gluon in the _ photon _ is minimised .",
    "requirement 3 ) can be assured most easily by imposing a lower cut @xmath77 on @xmath40 because at small @xmath40 the gluon in the photon is large . on the other hand , large values of @xmath40 ,",
    "corresponding mainly to direct initial state photons , correspond to small values of @xmath76 at a fixed @xmath78 value , according to eq .",
    "( [ xll ] ) .",
    "therefore 2 ) can be achieved by a cut @xmath79 on @xmath40 . in prompt photon production ,",
    "the contribution from the process @xmath80jet is rather small anyway because this process does exist only at nlo .",
    "therefore the subprocess @xmath81jet is the one which should dominate in the region fulfilling the requirements 1)3 ) , and our aim is to enhance the contribution of this subprocess . to this aim we investigated how cuts on @xmath40 act in this respect , and found that the cut @xmath82 maximally enhances the sensitivity to the gluon in the proton while keeping the contribution from @xmath83 negligible , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figcutxga ] .",
    "note that the contributions ` @xmath84 only ' and ` @xmath83 only ' are not disjunct , they both contain the subprocess @xmath85jet .",
    "this subprocess does not exist at leading order , but beyond lo its contribution is non - zero and in fact negative .",
    "this can clearly be seen in fig .",
    "[ figcutxga ] : the cut @xmath86 actually enhances the total value of the @xmath84-initiated part of the cross section , because the lower limit @xmath87 removes mainly the @xmath88 initiated part .",
    "the fact that the @xmath88 contribution is negative also reminds us that the individual subprocesses are unphysical , such that these considerations can be viewed only as qualitative reflections of the underlying parton dynamics .",
    "[ figsubeta ] shows in detail , as a function of the photon rapidity , how the requirement @xmath86 suppresses the direct photon contribution and enhances the relative importance of the subprocess @xmath89jet , especially in the region @xmath90 .",
    "another possibility to enhance the contribution of the @xmath91 initiated subprocesses is to impose rapidity cuts .",
    "whereas @xmath92 are variables where rapidity and energy measurements enter , using rapidity cuts only is very straightforward experimentally . at small rapidities the compton process @xmath93 dominates .",
    "further to the forward region , the importance of @xmath91 initiated subprocesses increases , while at very large rapidities the gluon in the photon also plays a role .",
    "therefore , one can also meet requirements 1 ) to 3 ) by restricting the photon and jet rapidities to positive values .",
    "[ xp_rapcuts ] shows that the relative contribution of @xmath84-initiated processes increases from about 35% of the total in the full rapidity range @xmath94 ( fig .",
    "[ xp_rapcuts]a ) , to about 48% in the region @xmath95 , while the contribution from the gluon in the photon is still small , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ xp_rapcuts]b .",
    "cutting further ( e.g. @xmath96 ) only reduces the cross section substantially and introduces a larger uncertainty from the gluon in the photon .",
    "comparing the two methods , we find that the cut @xmath86 reduces the total cross section only by about 31% , enhancing the contribution from the gluon in the proton from about 35% of the total to 56% of the total . the rapidity cut @xmath95 reduces the cross section by about 70% as compared to the range @xmath94 .",
    "[ xp_scal ] shows that the nlo cross section @xmath97 is very stable under scale changes .    in fig .",
    "[ mrs4 ] , we show the predictions obtained with different parametrisations of parton distribution functions for the proton , where we chose the set cteq6 m  @xcite and two different sets of mrst01  @xcite , the default set and the set mrst01j , which gives better agreement with the tevatron high-@xmath35 inclusive jet data due to a `` bump '' in the gluon distribution at large @xmath98 .    comparing figs .",
    "[ xp_scal ] and [ mrs4 ] , we notice that the differences in the cross sections due to different parton distribution functions are of the order of the variations due to the scale changes . however , this situation can be somewhat improved : fig .",
    "[ pdfscut ] shows that the cut @xmath82 makes the differences between various parametrisations more pronounced ( as it enhances the gluon initiated contribution to the cross section ) , especially in the region @xmath99 . on the other hand , the variation of the cross section due to scale changes in the region @xmath100",
    "is not increased by the presence of the cut on @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the reaction @xmath102+jet+x could indeed be useful to further constrain the gluon in the proton in the range @xmath100 . however , it is also clear that data with very high statistics are needed to distinguish between different parametrisations .",
    "the photoproduction of large-@xmath78 jets , hadrons and photons are privileged reactions to explore the gluon content of the resolved photon , which is hardly observable in @xmath103 dis .",
    "however , as discussed in the introduction , the scale dependence of the hadron and jet production cross sections is not negligible , whereas the photon cross section is more stable . this fact should allow us a more accurate determination of the gluon distribution in the photon , @xmath104 .    in fig .",
    "[ fulleta ] we display the various contributions to the cross section @xmath58 .",
    "the gluon distribution @xmath104 only contributes at small values of @xmath105 , corresponding to large values of @xmath106 , and we shall try , by various cuts , to enhance the relative contribution of this component .    in fig .",
    "[ cutxp ] we see that the direct contribution , corresponding to @xmath101 close to one , does not screen the contribution initiated by the gluon in the photon .",
    "but at smaller values of @xmath101 , the ` background ' coming from other subprocesses , such as @xmath107 , is large .",
    "exactly this fact has been exploited to enhance the gluon from the proton by restricting @xmath101 to intermediate values , see fig .",
    "[ figcutxga ] .",
    "now we would like to enhance the gluon from the _ photon _ , and therefore we impose a lower cut on @xmath108 in order to reduce the contributions from the gluon in the proton .",
    "however , this cut has no effect at very small values of @xmath101 , where the gluon in the photon is most visible .",
    "therefore , contrary to the situation for the gluon in the proton treated in the previous subsection , cuts on the photon and jet rapidities are more effective than cuts on @xmath108 to enhance the gluon in the photon , as shown in fig .  [ cutrap ] .",
    "[ cutrap]a ) shows that if the photon and jet rapidities are restricted to positive values , the resolved photon component is already fairly large , but the gluon content of the latter is still small .",
    "if we restrict the rapidities more to the forward region  especially the jet rapidity , which can be measured at larger angles  the direct photon contribution is almost completely suppressed , and the gluon contribution makes up almost 40% of the total , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cutrap]b ) . imposing even more severe cuts only decreases the cross section further without increasing the gluon content substantially , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ cutrap]c ) .",
    "therefore the rapidity cut @xmath109 seems to be the optimal compromise between enhancement of the gluon content and reduction of the cross section .",
    "note that the lower cuts on the transverse momenta are rather large , @xmath110gev , @xmath67gev .",
    "one can increase the cross section by choosing lower @xmath78 cuts , as shown in fig .",
    "[ xgamscal ] .",
    "this figure also shows the scale dependence of @xmath111 in the presence of the cuts @xmath112 respectively @xmath113 .",
    "the behaviour of the cross section @xmath111 , which varies by @xmath1148% under the scale changes , is less good than the behaviour of @xmath115 ( see fig .  [ xp_scal ] ) .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the distribution @xmath83 is poorly known and that a determination of the latter with an accuracy of @xmath11410% would already be welcome .",
    "in this work we studied the possibility to measure the gluon distribution in the proton and in the photon by means of the reaction @xmath116 + p @xmath117 jet + x. this reaction is well suited for such a study because of the stability of the theoretical prediction under variations of the renormalisation and factorisation scales , and because the prompt photon cross section does not suffer from large uncertainties due to hadronisation in the final state .",
    "the effects of cuts on @xmath101 respectively @xmath108 , or on the pseudo - rapidities @xmath120 and @xmath121 , are investigated in detail .",
    "we found that a judicious choice of cuts allows us to enhance the ` signals ' , i.e. the gluon induced subprocesses , over the ` background ' stemming from other subprocesses , to constitute up to @xmath122% of the total cross section .",
