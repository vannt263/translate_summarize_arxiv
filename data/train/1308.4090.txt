    "the aim of this paper is to give a detailed description of the theory of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of light in a dye - filled optical microcavity , a new physical phenomenon that was experimentally observed in 2010  @xcite .",
    "this observation is an important achievement in the study of critical phenomena in optical systems @xcite and has attracted considerable interest @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "a microcavity composed of two highly reflecting spherical dielectric mirrors is filled with a dye solution and confines photons , which are repeatedly absorbed and reemitted by dye molecules . in the microcavity",
    ", we have a photon gas that continuously interacts with the dye solution , and the photon gas can undergo bec under certain conditions , which reflects in a macroscopic accumulation of photons in the ground cavity mode .",
    "the theory of the light bec was developed in 2012  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the hierarchical maximum entropy principle  @xcite and describes the microscopic , mesoscopic , and macroscopic bec of photons at all temperatures , including the whole critical region .",
    "the theory presented here generalizes that of ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of an arbitrary number of excitations , which can even exceed the number of dye molecules in the microcavity .",
    "in addition to the hierarchical maximum entropy principle , an alternative approach to the light bec  the master equation approach  is developed and the equivalence of the two approaches is demonstrated .",
    "finally , the light bec is considered not only in the case of a fixed mean total photon number but also in the case of a fixed total excitation number .",
    "the theory allows one to fully determine the statistical properties of the photon gas and , in particular , to study fluctuations of different cavity modes , including the condensate and polarized condensate , and fluctuations of the photon gas as a whole .",
    "significantly , the theory does not use the grand canonical approximation and consistently takes into account the photon polarization degeneracy and the interaction of all the cavity modes with dye molecules .",
    "the theory predicts the universal relation between the degrees of second - order coherence for the polarized photon condensate and the whole photon condensate .",
    "moreover , it predicts sub - poissonian photon statistics for these condensates under certain conditions , thereby implying that the photon bose - einstein condensate can be used as a new source of nonclassical light . it would be interesting to observe the predictions of the theory experimentally .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , the energy spectrum of an optical microcavity is presented , its quantum interpretation is given , and the polarized and whole photon condensates are defined . in sec .",
    "iii , quantum states of the system of photons and dye molecules interacting with each other in the microcavity are described and excitations the number of which is conserved during the interaction are defined . in sec .",
    "iv , the hierarchical maximum entropy principle is briefly outlined and then applied to the system to investigate its fluctuating behavior ; viz . , the probability distribution of the system over all quantum states is determined , from which the probability distribution of the photon gas over fock states and that of the subsystem of dye molecules over the numbers of ground - state and excited molecules are derived . in sec .",
    "v , the master equation directly describing the interaction between photons and dye molecules in the microcavity is obtained and the equivalence between the hierarchical maximum entropy principle and the master equation approach is shown .",
    "vi , fluctuations of the photon gas are investigated in more detail : the probability distributions of the number of photons in the whole photon gas , in each cavity mode , and at each energy level are found and the probability distributions of the number of photons in the condensate and polarized condensate are obtained from the above distributions as a special case . in sec .",
    "vii , the universal relation between the degrees of second - order coherence for the polarized and whole photon condensates is derived . in sec .",
    "viii , an analogy is drawn between the light bec in an optical microcavity and the usual atomic bec in a two - dimensional harmonic trap and the critical temperature and temperature dependence of the condensate fraction in the thermodynamic limit are derived from this analogy . in sec .",
    "ix , the cases of a fixed mean total photon number and a fixed total excitation number are considered , the temperature dependence of the condensate fraction , photon fraction , critical temperature , degrees of second - order coherence , mandel parameters , and reduced standard deviations for the polarized and whole photon condensates in the microscopic , mesoscopic , and macroscopic cases is discussed , and the possibility of sub - poissonian photon statistics for the condensates is underlined . in sec .",
    "x , concluding remarks are given and future prospects are outlined .",
    "consider an optical cavity composed of two mirrors with a radius of curvature @xmath0 that are separated by a distance  @xmath1 .",
    "the cavity is filled with a dye solution with a refractive index  @xmath2 , which determines the speed of light in the medium , @xmath3 .",
    "the frequency spectrum of the cavity with @xmath4 is @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a mode frequency , @xmath7 is the cavity free spectral range , the frequency spacing between successive longitudinal resonances , @xmath8 is a longitudinal mode number , equal to the number of half wavelengths fitting into the mirror spacing in the case of longitudinal resonance , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are nonnegative transverse mode numbers . in the experiment",
    "@xcite , @xmath11  m whereas @xmath12  @xmath13 m .",
    "since @xmath14 , we can use in eq .   the asymptotic formula @xmath15 for a nonnegative @xmath16 and write @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20    experimentally , the mirror spacing is so small that the free spectral range of the optical microcavity is comparable to the spectral width of the dye . in this case , the emission of photons with a fixed longitudinal number @xmath8 dominates , and the cavity field is a set of @xmath21 modes corresponding to  @xmath8 .",
    "note that the last term on the right - hand side of eq .   coincides with the spectrum of a two - dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with frequency  @xmath22 . with this observation",
    ", we can look at the spectrum   from another perspective : in the paraxial approximation  @xcite , we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hamiltonian of a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath22 given by eq .",
    ", @xmath25 is a transverse photon momentum , @xmath26 is a transverse wave number , @xmath27 is a distance from the optical axis , and @xmath28 is an effective photon mass formally defined by the relation @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the cavity induces a photon mass and provides a harmonic potential , thereby playing the role of a two - dimensional harmonic trap for massive photons ; @xmath22  is the trap frequency .    the quantization procedure for the hamiltonian   yields the following eigenvalues : @xmath30 where the nonnegative quantum numbers @xmath9 and @xmath10 are exactly the transverse mode numbers entering in eq .",
    "; they are the eigenvalues of hamiltonians @xmath31 and @xmath32 for one - dimensional oscillations along two mutually orthogonal directions in the plane orthogonal to the optical axis : @xmath33 with @xmath34 . from eqs .",
    "and   we get @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the energy of a ground - mode photon , a photon in the tem@xmath37 mode .",
    "the spectrum   coincides with that given by eq .  .",
    "in addition to the two nonnegative transverse quantum numbers @xmath9 and  @xmath10 , there exists a polarization quantum number @xmath38 that takes on the value @xmath39 or  @xmath40 and denotes one of the two photon polarizations .",
    "it follows from eq .   that the microcavity has a discrete equidistant energy spectrum such that the energy and degeneracy of the @xmath41th level are @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively ; @xmath44 in eq .",
    "reflects the twofold photon polarization degeneracy .    a photon in the tem@xmath45 mode and with polarization  @xmath38 , which will be called a mode-@xmath46 photon , has energy @xmath47 .",
    "a set of mode-@xmath46 photons constitute mode  @xmath46 .",
    "it is convenient to somehow number all the modes with the same energy .",
    "we can then characterize every mode by two quantum numbers : the number  @xmath41 of the energy level and the number  @xmath48 of the mode .",
    "a possible way to do this is to arrange all the modes @xmath46 with a fixed @xmath49 in increasing order of @xmath9 and then each two modes with a fixed @xmath9 in increasing order of  @xmath38 , so that mode  @xmath46 has number  @xmath50 . thus , we will deal with mode  @xmath51 instead of mode  @xmath46 , and a mode-@xmath46 photon becomes a mode-@xmath51 photon , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 . for any given  @xmath41",
    ", the mode number lies in the range @xmath52    the photon condensate is a set of photons with minimum energy .",
    "these condensate photons are ground - mode photons , which have energy @xmath53  .",
    "the ground state is degenerate and consists of photons of two polarizations . in this connection , we additionally define a polarized ground - mode photon , a ground - mode photon of a definite polarization , and consider a polarized photon condensate , a set of polarized ground - mode photons .",
    "the whole photon condensate is then a mixture of two polarized photon condensates , the first comprising mode-@xmath54 photons and the second comprising mode-@xmath55 photons .",
    "the two polarized condensates obviously have the same statistical properties , but as we will see below , the properties of a polarized condensate differ significantly from those of the condensate considered as a whole . incidentally , we may mention an analogy with bec of quasiequilibrium magnons experimentally observed in thin yttrium - iron - garnet films under microwave pumping at room temperature @xcite : the lowest - energy magnon state is twofold degenerate , and the magnon condensate consists of two components with the same frequency but with opposite wavenumbers  @xcite .",
    "we can consider the microcavity with photons and dye molecules as composed of two interacting subsystems .",
    "the first subsystem is the photon gas . to characterize its state ,",
    "consider a set @xmath56 of the numbers of photons in all cavity modes , with @xmath57 being the number of mode-@xmath51 photons .",
    "were all these photon numbers constant , we would have the photon gas in a fock state  @xmath58 , which is given by a vector composed of the numbers of photons in each mode : @xmath59 in general , these numbers are not constant and fluctuate due to repeated absorption and reemission of photons by dye molecules .",
    "we may thus find the photon gas in the fock state @xmath58 only with a probability  @xmath60 . to investigate statistical properties of the photon gas and describe its bec",
    ", we should derive the probability distribution  @xmath61 .",
    "the second subsystem is the dye solution , which consists of a solvent and a number of dye molecules , @xmath62 .",
    "some dye molecules are in the ground singlet electronic state  @xmath63 , the rest are in the first excited singlet electronic state  @xmath64 .",
    "let us enumerate all the dye molecules .",
    "we can then characterize the state of the subsystem of dye molecules by an @xmath62-dimensional vector @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , is @xmath39 or @xmath40 if the @xmath68th dye molecule is , respectively , in the ground or first excited singlet electronic state . if the number of dye molecules of the first kind is @xmath69 and the number of dye molecules of the second kind is @xmath70 , then @xmath71 with @xmath72    consider the whole system .",
    "its state is determined by the states of the subsystems and hence is characterized by a joint state vector @xmath73 because of interaction between the subsystems , this vector fluctuates and has a probability distribution @xmath74 .",
    "a ground - state molecule can absorb a photon and become an excited molecule ; conversely , an excited molecule can emit a photon and become a ground - state molecule .",
    "denote by @xmath75 the total photon number : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of photons at the @xmath41th energy level .",
    "we can conveniently define excitations in the microcavity as photons and excited dye molecules .",
    "the number of excitations so defined is @xmath78 and does not change during photon absorption and emission . in this sense ,",
    "the photon gas and dye solution interact exchanging excitations in a number - conserving way .",
    "the microcavity is at a temperature  @xmath79 .",
    "a significant feature is fast thermalization of the population of the electronic states of dye molecules .",
    "every dye molecule is in contact with the solvent , which plays the role of thermostat of temperature  @xmath79 .",
    "the typical thermalization time is @xmath80  ps at room temperature , the temperature in the experiment  @xcite , and is short compared with the typical fluorescence lifetime @xmath81  ns @xcite .",
    "we thus have apparent separation of the time scales corresponding to thermalization and fluorescence , so that photon emission occurs from thermally equilibrated excited states .",
    "the aforementioned fast thermalization and time - scale separation allow us to consider the microcavity with photons and dye molecules interacting with each other as a generalized superstatistical system  @xcite .",
    "such systems arise in the context of generalized superstatistics , a `` statistics of superstatistics , '' and , as well as ordinary superstatistical systems  @xcite , are characterized by hierarchical structures of dynamics .",
    "the hierarchy is formed by the decomposition of the system dynamics into different dynamics on different spatiotemporal scales largely separated from each other .",
    "different fluctuating parameters correspond to different levels of dynamics of a generalized superstatistical system . in our system",
    ", we have fluctuations of the energy of dye molecules and those of the state  @xmath82 of the whole system .",
    "the former fluctuations correspond to fast thermalization and are wholly determined by the inverse temperature @xmath83 the latter fluctuations correspond to the interaction between the photon gas and dye solution , which reflects in the repeated change in the numbers of ground - state and excited dye molecules and photons in each cavity mode .",
    "the inverse temperature in itself does not fluctuate .",
    "the probability distributions of the fluctuating parameters of a generalized superstatistical system can be found using the hierarchical maximum entropy principle  @xcite .",
    "this principle generalizes the maximum entropy approaches related to superstatistics  @xcite and consists in arranging the levels of dynamics in increasing order of dynamical time scale and consecutively maximizing the boltzmann - gibbs - shannon entropy at each level . in the context of the considered system ,",
    "the hierarchical maximum entropy principle is reduced to consideration of thermalization of dye molecules , which corresponds to maximization of the entropy at the lower dynamical level , and subsequent maximization of the entropy of the whole system .",
    "consider thermalization of dye molecules .",
    "let @xmath84 and @xmath85 be the density of rovibrational states for the ground , @xmath63 , and first excited , @xmath64 , singlet electronic state , respectively . when defining the density  @xmath86 , with @xmath87 or  @xmath40 , it is convenient to measure the molecular energy @xmath88 from the energy of the lowest - energy substate , @xmath89 , corresponding to the state  @xmath90 : @xmath91 .",
    "the densities @xmath84 and @xmath85 are zero for any negative  @xmath92 and become positive as @xmath92 passes through zero , so that @xmath93 is the density of energy states near  @xmath89 . because of thermalization , we have for every dye molecule the gibbs canonical distribution @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the inverse temperature  , @xmath96 is the partition function , and @xmath97 is the reduced partition function , with @xmath87 for a ground - state dye molecule and @xmath40 for an excited dye molecule .",

    "nonclassical properties of the condensates are especially pronounced for small photon numbers and at low temperatures .",

    ", the state of the photon gas is expected to be close to the unpolarized fock state in the @xmath428 mode .",
    "it is also reasonable to conduct the measurements of the degree of second - order coherence not only for the photon condensate as a whole but also for the polarized condensate by isolating one polarization mode with a polarizer in order to observe the universal relation  .",
    "thus , the behavior of the degree of second - order coherence for the polarized and whole photon condensates implies that a dye - filled optical microcavity in which the light bec takes place can be the source of nonclassical light , both polarized and unpolarized , with sub - poissonian photon statistics and antibunching .",

    "@xcite is not suitable for observation of nonclassical light generation : in this experiment , an external laser is used to pump the microcavity and eventually to increase the number of photons confined .",
    "this technique allows one to reach the inequality @xmath461 by increasing the critical temperature  @xmath373 as a result of increasing the photon number whereas the microcavity remains at a constant temperature  @xmath79 , room temperature .",
    "however , the number of photons in the microcavity becomes very large , @xmath462 , and hence it is impossible to distinguish between sub - poissonian and poissonian statistics of the emitted light on the basis of measurements of the degree of second - order coherence .",
    "accordingly , a new experimental scheme that allows one to reach small photon numbers and low reduced temperatures , or probably a modification of the old scheme and the experimental conditions , should be proposed to observe nonclassical light generation . to reach a lower reduced temperature , it might be necessary , for example , to change the temperature of the microcavity , choose the microcavity with other geometric parameters that determine @xmath22  , the mirror spacing and curvature , and use other fluorophores that fill the microcavity .",
    "we finally note an interesting feature of the light bec : under some conditions , the total number of photons in the microcavity virtually coincides with the total number of excitations , at least in some temperature interval .",
    "as we have seen , this fact implies that the fluctuations of the total photon number are very small . in this case , it is natural to expect some resemblance to the mesoscopic bec of a fixed number of atoms in a two - dimensional harmonic trap .",
    "the question arises whether it is possible to restore any results of the theory of the mesoscopic canonical - ensemble bec @xcite using the approach of this paper . in this connection .",
    "we might consider an imaginary situation of a microcavity with a fictitious light that has no polarization degeneracy ; we would then have a microcavity the energy spectrum of which completely coincides with that of a two - dimensional harmonic trap , and we might construct a theory analogous to that described here .",
