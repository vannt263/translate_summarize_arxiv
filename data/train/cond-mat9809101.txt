    "the notion of non - integer dimension although developed by mathematicians in late 19th - early 20th centuries has found its wide application in physics only in the last few decades .",
    "this application was mainly initiated by the pioneering work of b. mandelbrot who attracted attention to the fact that `` fractal '' geometry provides an appropriate framework for the description of a whole range of complex structures that are formed from smaller subunits @xcite . whereas such structures are characterized by appropriate fractal dimensions ,",
    "their growth and spatial correlations @xcite are described by a ( non - trivial ) spectrum of multifractal ( mf ) dimensions @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the properties of diffusion phenomena in the presence of an absorbing polymer .",
    "this provides another example of a multifractal phenomenon in condensed matter physics . to this end",
    "we use the model proposed by cates and witten @xcite and derive the mf spectrum in the frames of a field theoretical formalism using the renormalization group @xcite method .",
    "the mf spectrum is related to the spectrum of exponents governing scaling properties of co - polymer stars @xcite .",
    "we calculate this spectrum to the third order of perturbation theory and report the numerical values of the quantities that characterize the mf behaviour .",
    "long flexible polymer chains @xcite provide a classical example of fractal objects ( see fig . [",
    "fig1]a ) .    [ htbp ]",
    "fig1.pic    of particular interest is the manner in which such a chain absorbs diffusing particles .",
    "the flux of particles on the surface of the absorbing chain is defined by the density of incoming particles close to the absorber ( see fig . [ fig1]b ) . taken @xmath0 to be the probability density of incoming particles",
    "the problem is to solve the steady - state diffusion equation ( laplace equation ) @xmath1 with boundary conditions for a given absorbing polymer @xmath2 one motivation for the study of this problem is to gain insight to the description of diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) @xcite .",
    "the last phenomenon is much more complicated because of the fact that for dla the boundary conditions are given on the surface of growing aggregate itself .",
    "the process described by equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) may be rather considered as diffusion limited catalysis , when particles of one type interact with a _ prescribed _ fractal ( a catalysing polymer ) and transform into the other type @xcite .",
    "let the absorbing polymer of size @xmath3 be chosen from the well defined ensemble of saw .",
    "then we are interested in the moments of the field @xmath0 close to the surface of the absorber ( see fig . [ fig1]b ) . for distances @xmath4",
    "( @xmath5 being a cut off ) the averaged moments @xmath6 are expected to scale as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the average over the ensemble of polymers .",
    "let us take that the flux @xmath9 onto any randomly chosen point @xmath10 of the absorber is proportional to the field @xmath11 at a point that is as close as a cut off length @xmath5 from the absorber .",
    "then , for the averaged moments of the flux one finds : @xmath12 following @xcite we associate with the flux of the laplacian field a `` harmonic measure '' @xmath13 defined on the set of absorbing sites @xmath10 : @xmath14 where the sum in ( [ 4 ] ) spans all sites @xmath10 of the absorber . in particular , the mass @xmath15 of the absorber is given by @xmath16 and ( [ 4 ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath17 where @xmath8 denotes the site average @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "it is standard @xcite to describe the properties of the harmonic measure by a _ set of exponents _ @xmath19 given by : @xmath20 note , that for @xmath21 @xmath22 is the fractal dimension of the absorber .",
    "multifractal scaling is found when the spectrum @xmath19 is non - trivial : @xmath23 , or correspondingly ( c.f .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) ) @xmath24 .",
    "note as well that from ( [ 3 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) the exponents @xmath25 and @xmath19 are related : @xmath26.\\ ] ] in many cases the description of a multifractal measure is performed in terms of the _ hlder exponent _ @xmath27 and the _ spectral function _ @xmath28 that are defined by a legendre transform of @xmath19 @xcite : @xmath29 , \\label{8 } \\\\",
    "f(\\alpha ) & = & n \\alpha(n ) + ( 1-n)d(n ) . \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath28 differs for different fractal measures but it possesses certain ` universal ' properties . in particular , its maximum @xmath30 gives the fractal dimension of the absorber and @xmath31 is convex @xmath32 .",
    "the central idea that allows us to calculate the properties of the solutions of equation ( [ 1 ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ 2 ] ) is that a path integral representation both for the field @xmath0 and for the absorber ( being a rw or a saw ) is possible @xcite . in terms of the path integral solution of the laplace equation one",
    "finds that @xmath0 at point @xmath33 near absorber is proportional to the number of rw that end at point @xmath33 and avoid the absorber .",
    "the @xmath34th power of this field is proportional to the @xmath34th power of the above mentioned number , i.e. it is defined by a partition function of a star polymer with @xmath34 arms @xcite ( the latter is shown by dashed lines in fig . [",
    "fig1]b ) . furthermore",
    ", introducing the mutual avoidance conditions between the `` @xmath34-arm star '' and the 2-arm polymer ( representing the absorber ) one has to calculate the partition function of a co - polymer star consisting of chains of two different species that avoid each other .",
    "these correspond to the trajectories of diffusing particles ( being rw ) and the absorbing polymer ( which for the purpose of present study is chosen as rw or saw ) . making use of the previously developed @xcite theory of copolymer stars and networks and mapping the model of co - polymer stars to the appropriate field theory @xcite",
    "one may relate @xcite the mf spectrum exponents ( [ 3 ] ) to the exponents that define the scaling properties of co - polymer stars .",
    "in particular , for a co - polymer star consisting of @xmath35 chains of species @xmath36 and @xmath37 chains of species @xmath38 the number of configurations @xmath39 scales like @xcite : @xmath40 here , the @xmath41 represent the co - polymer star exponents . the latter have been calculated using a field theoretical renormalization group approach @xcite and are known in the third order of perturbation theory in @xmath42 and pseudo-@xmath43 @xcite expansions @xcite . by means of a short - chain expansion @xcite the set of exponents @xmath41",
    "can be related to the exponents @xmath25 ( [ 3 ] ) , that govern the scaling of the @xmath34th moment of the flux onto an absorbing linear chain . considering the absorber to be either a rw or a saw we define the exponents : @xmath44 here",
    ", we keep notations of @xcite for the expressions for exponents @xmath45 defined in different fixed points of the renormalization group transformation .",
    "based on these expressions we get : @xmath46 @xmath47 here , @xmath42 , @xmath48 is the space dimension , and @xmath49 is the riemann zeta function .",

    "as is well known , the series of type ( [ 13])-([18 ] ) , as they occur in field theory appear to be of asymptotic nature with zero radius of convergence .",
    "however , knowledge of the asymptotic behavior of the series as derived from the renormalization group theory allows us to evaluate these asymptotic series ( see e.g.@xcite ) . to this end",
    "several procedures are available depending on the additional information known for the series to be resummed .",
    "we use the borel summation technique improved by a conformal mapping procedure that has served as a powerful tool in field theoretic calculations ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "[ htbp ]    ( fig.2a)fig2a.pic + ( fig.2b)fig2b.pic    table [ tab1 ] contains the results for the exponents @xmath61 and @xmath62 obtained in @xmath43 and in pseudo-@xmath43 expansion techniques at @xmath63 from the corresponding values of exponents @xmath64 @xcite with the application of this resummation procedure .",
    "we have calculated the spectral function that describes the scaling of the moments of measure defined by diffusion near an absorbing polymer .",
    "these moments were calculated as averages over all configurations of the absorber instead of performing a site average .",
    "thus the interpretation of @xmath28 itself does not directly correspond to the standard picture , where @xmath28 is interpreted as the fractal dimension of a particular subset of the measure @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we derive @xmath28 in the same way from the spectrum of scaling exponents of the moments of a measure . as we will see below in the general properties of @xmath28",
    "also hold for the present definition .",
    "our numerical results for the spectral function for space dimension @xmath63 are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig2]a,[fig2]b .",
    "they were obtained from the series for @xmath55 and @xmath56 as functions of @xmath34 .",
    "we show the results of the resummation procedure described above applied to the series in @xmath43- and pseudo-@xmath43- expansion . for comparison",
    "we also show the curve for direct summation of the @xmath43 and pseudo-@xmath43 series to the 2nd order ( here we recover the second - order results of @xcite ) .",
    "in addition we have performed an analytical continuation of our series in the form of a [ 2/1 ] pad approximant for the third order series .",
    "it is obvious that the direct summation of the last series fails to converge and gives reasonable values for @xmath65 only for small values of @xmath34 , i.e. near the maximum of @xmath28 at @xmath21 .",
    "the symmetry of the pad approximant holds only in the region shown and may be an artifact of the method . on the left wing , where it coincides with the resummed results the pad approximant provides a continuation that is compatible with the estimation for the minimal @xmath27 value @xmath66 .",
    "the pad result is @xmath67 , @xmath68 for the rw absorber and @xmath69 , @xmath70 for the saw absorber , which is calculated here only from 3rd order perturbation theory .",
    "as can be extrapolated from the pad approximant and as was shown also on the basis approximations for higher moments @xmath34 @xcite , @xmath28 as it is defined here , will become negative near @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "for this reason the identification of @xmath28 as the fractal dimension of some identifiable subset is not possible here .",
    "also the extrapolation of the resummed data seems to indicate such a behavior .",
    "note , however , that the perturbative approach , even in combination with resummation and analytical continuation is still not capable to give reliable results for high values of the expansion parameters . in particular",
    "this method is only good near the maximum of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "though the results obtained for @xmath55 and @xmath56 for a specific value of @xmath34 differ in both approaches , the same curve @xmath28 is described with better coincidence for the left wing of the curves , corresponding to positive @xmath34 .",
    "the resummation techniques we apply have proven to be a powerful tool already in the field theoretical approach to critical phenomena and have lead to high precision values for critical exponents .",
    "we believe that the application of these methods to calculations of mf phenomena also allows to improve the reliability and comparability of these results .",
