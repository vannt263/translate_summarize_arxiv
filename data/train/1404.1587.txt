    "cytoskeletal molecular motors are a large class of proteins that generate movement and force in biological cells by cycling between states bound and unbound from a cytoskeletal filament @xcite . in general , they can be classified as processive or non - processive motors .",
    "processive motors like kinesin , dynein or myosin v have a duty ratio ( fraction of time of the motor cycle spent on the filament ) close to unity and therefore are particularly suited for persistent transport of cellular cargo , such as vesicles , small organelles or viruses . using small groups of processive motors",
    "increases the walk length and the efficiency of transport compared to the single motor @xcite . a theoretical treatment with a one - step master equation showed that the effective unbinding rate decreases exponentially with the size of the motor ensemble @xcite .",
    "moreover groups of motors can also work against larger load than the single motor @xcite .",
    "if motors of different directionality on the substrate are attached to the same cargo , bidirectional movement can ensue @xcite , as often observed in cargo transport .",
    "a similar tug - of - war setup has been used earlier to explain mitotic spindle oscillations @xcite .",
    "non - processive motors such as have a duty ratio significantly smaller than unity . therefore , non - processive motors have to operate in groups in order to generate appreciable levels of force .",
    "similar to processive motors , the duty ratio of a group of non - processive motors increases with the size of the group and can become large enough that the group effectively behaves like a processive motor .",
    "this is certainly true for the sarcomeres in skeletal muscle , where typically hundreds of work together as one group . combining structural investigations of skeletal muscle with modeling",
    "has led to the swinging cross - bridge model for single @xcite .",
    "a statistical treatment then has allowed to accurately model the dynamics of the motor ensemble in muscle sarcomeres @xcite .",
    "groups of motors also play a crucial role for the mechanics and adhesion of non - muscle tissue cells .",
    "cytoskeletal assembles into bipolar minifilaments consisting of @xmath1-@xmath2 motors @xcite .",
    "they interact with an actin cytoskeleton which is much less ordered than in muscle , mainly in the actin cortex as well as in the contractile actin networks and bundles associated with cell adhesion and migration @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that the activity of minifilaments contributes to the sorting of actin filament orientation because of the asymmetric elasticity of actin filaments @xcite .",
    "the based forces generated in the actin cytoskeleton are transmitted to the extracellular environment via adhesion sites , which have been shown to harbor different mechanosensitive processes @xcite . in particular ,",
    "mature focal adhesions are often connected to actin stress fibers consisting of parallel bundles of actin filaments with alternating polarity enabling minifilaments to contract the bundles and thus mechanically load the adhesion sites . to apply these forces effectively",
    ", the extracellular matrix underlying the adhesion sites must not be too soft .",
    "therefore , cells are sensitive to the elasticity of the substrate and adhere preferentially to stiffer substrates @xcite .",
    "if the environment is much stiffer than the cell , it essentially deforms itself and becomes insensitive to the environmental stiffness @xcite .",
    "therefore cellular stiffness sets the scale for the sensitivity of rigidity sensing @xcite . due to the complex interplay of many components in a cell , it is difficult to identify the exact contribution of to the rigidity response of cells .",
    "one promising experimental route is the reconstruction of _ in vitro",
    "_ systems of motors and filaments @xcite , which in the future might allow us to probe these relations in more quantitative detail .",
    "with the focus on the description of large assemblies of motors in the muscle sarcomere , theoretical progress has been made mainly through mean - field models @xcite or computer simulations @xcite . for ensembles consisting of a large number of motors , details about internal motor states",
    "are less important and experimentally accessible . instead ,",
    "collective quantities such as velocity , walk length and number of bound motor are of large interest . for example",
    ", generic two - state ratchet models have been used to study the behavior of mechanically coupled motors @xcite . here",
    "we aim at understanding minifilaments with few molecules for which molecular details and stochastic effects are expected to be more important . in this context , cross - bridge models are appropriate , which have been studied before mainly with computer simulations @xcite .",
    "however , this approach is numerically costly , in particular for extensions to systems with multiple minifilaments .",
    "recently the parallel cluster model ( ) based on the cross - bridge cycle has been introduced as an efficient yet detailed model for stochastic effects in small ensembles @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    ", we extend the to minifilaments by modeling them as two ensembles of motors working against each other by walking along two actin tracks with opposing polarity .",
    "this situation can be considered as a tug - of - war of the two ensembles of non - processive motors , in analogy to a tug - of - war of processive motors @xcite .",
    "in contrast to those studies , however , we do not use a phenomenological force - velocity relation , but rather a cross - bridge model to explicitly include the molecular details of the motor cycle of .",
    "in particular , we account for the catch bond character of unbinding ( dissociation rate decreases under load , in contrast to the classical case of a slip bond ) and for the detailed kinetics of the power stroke . from our model definition , it becomes clear that the mechanical situation in bipolar minifilaments is very complex , with an effective spring constant that depends on internal mechanics , external mechanics and the exact state of the motor ensembles .",
    "our main result is that minifilaments show a kind of mechanosensitivity that is reminiscent of the way cells respond to environmental stiffness .",
    "we show that this effect not only results from the molecular catch - bonding property , but also from the inability to perform the power stroke in a stiff environment with sufficiently large force .",
    "we also find that catch - bonding of on stiff substrates leads to frequent switches of direction of the ensemble movement and therefore to an effective diffusion constant which decreases with increasing ensemble size , in marked contrast to a tug - of - war of processive motors with slip bonds .",
    "in the parallel cluster model ( ) , individual motors are described by a cross - bridge model with three discrete states and stochastic transitions between them @xcite . here",
    "we generalize this model for minifilaments and discuss it with parameter values originally introduced for modeling skeletal muscle @xcite .",
    "for cytoskeletal , these values depend on the exact isoform one is considering . the parameter values used here",
    "result in a duty ratio of @xmath3 , which lies in the range of duty ratios reported for cytoskeletal b @xcite .",
    "as shown schematically in ( a ) , a motor comprises three mechanical elements .",
    "the motor head binds to the substrate and contains the hydrolysis site , which binds or its hydrolysis products and .",
    "the rigid lever arm is hinged to the motor head and alternates between stretched and primed conformation , thus amplifying conformational changes in the motor head .",
    "the linear elastic neck linker with spring constant @xmath4 anchors the lever arm to the rigid motor filament . in the unbound ( ) state ,",
    "the motor head is loaded with and and the lever arm is primed .",
    "the motor reversibly transitions to the weakly - bound ( ) state with on - rate @xmath5 and off - rate @xmath6 . with release of , the lever arm swings to the stretched conformation and",
    "the motor enters the post - power - stroke ( ) state .",
    "the power stroke is reversible with forward rate @xmath7 and reverse rate @xmath8 but is driven towards the state by the free energy bias @xmath9 .",
    "this energy is stored in the primed conformation of the lever arm as part of the energy released in hydrolysis .",
    "replacing by , unbinding and hydrolysis brings from the to the state , thus completing the motor cycle .",
    "these events are subsumed in a single reaction with unloaded rate @xmath10 which is assumed to be irreversible due of the hydrolysis of .",
    "dynamics is characterized by the load dependence of power stroke and unbinding from state : the power stroke moves the lever arm by the power - stroke length @xmath11 ; unbinding from the state requires an additional movement of the lever arm by a distance @xmath12 .",
    "thus , both reactions become slower under load . the reduced rate of unbinding under load",
    "makes the state of a catch bond rather than a slip bond in the range of forces considered here .",

    "the strain of weakly - bound ( ) motors is denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "the minifilament consists of two ensembles of motors working in opposite direction .",
    "the motors are anchored to the rigid motor filament joining the two ensembles . within each ensemble ,",
    "motors are arranged in parallel whereas the two ensembles operate in series .",
    "the total number of motors in the ensemble working in direction ( towards the right in ( b ) ) is denoted by @xmath24 ; the number of motors in the ensemble working in direction ( towards the left in ( b ) ) is denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "the ensembles move on actin filaments of opposite polarity which are attached to linear elastic elements with spring constant @xmath26 and @xmath27 to represent the effective elasticity of the environment .",
    "the opposite polarity allows the minifilament to slide the actin filaments relative to each other and thereby to stretch the springs .",
    "the first approximation of the is to assume that motors in equivalent mechano - chemical states exert equal forces ( equal load sharing ) .",
    "this mean - field approximation is justified by the small duty ratio of non - processive motors .",
    "the elongation or strain of motors in and ensemble is denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , so that motors exert the force @xmath28 .",
    "the strain is positive , when the neck linker is stretched against the moving direction of the ensemble ( inwards in ( b ) ) . with the assumption of equal load sharing ,",
    "motor ensembles are mechanically equivalent to adhesion clusters of parallel bonds as depicted in ( c ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the adhesion cluster , however , the rest length of the bond is not fixed , but is reduced by a length @xmath22 due to the power stroke .",
    "thus , motors in the state have the strain @xmath23 and exert the force @xmath29 . the strain of as well as",

    "here we have introduced a new model for the stochastic dynamics of minifilaments . analyzing the stochastic trajectories and",
    "the mean force generation predicted by our model revealed a switch of the dynamic behavior of the minifilaments in response to changes of the environmental elasticity as a consequence of two independent mechano - sensitive processes .",
    "first catch bonding of motors depends directly on the load on the motors .",
    "a gradual increase of load decreases the reverse rate and increases the number of bound motors to stabilize ensemble attachment .",
    "second the transition from to state provides another type of catch bonding because unbinding from state is slower than from state , @xmath140 .",
    "there are two important differences : @xmath179 to transitions reduce the reverse rates @xmath96 abruptly and @xmath181 the transition is sensitive not only to minifilament load but also to the elasticity of the environment",
    ". for single ensembles , to transitions only occur in elastic environments , but not for ensembles working against constant external load @xcite . in a miniflament",
    ", the elastic neck linkers provide an elastic environment for the ensembles even with rigid anchorage .",
    "therefore our model demonstrates the importance of considering both the internal and external mechanics when investigating the function of a minifilament .",
    "both mechano - sensitive processes cooperate in stabilizing minifilament attachment .",
    "while permanent attachment can be reached with catch bonding of motors alone , the transition from to state shifts the switch to smaller external stiffness and steepens the transition . on the other hand ,",
    "the transition to the state alone is not sufficient for stable attachment .",
    "the two mechano - sensitive processes have contrasting effects on minifilament dynamics . catch bonding of motors allows to distribute load on a growing number of bound motors .",
    "this increases the velocity of an ensemble at a given load and increases the stall force . in the context of sarcomeric and cytoskeletal ensembles working against a constant external load",
    ", it was shown that catch bonding of motors leads to the characteristic upward convex force - velocity relation @xcite . for minifilaments , catch bonding of motors increases the mean force exerted in an elastic environment .",
    "transitions from to state , on the other hand , limit the increase of force because motors are required for an increase of contraction , so that minifilaments adjust themselves to an isometric state . in single ensembles working against a linear external load",
    ", the force generated by the ensembles breaks down for very stiff external load because the power stroke can no longer be performed at @xmath156 . in minifilaments ,",
    "the effective stiffness is limited by the elasticity of the neck linkers and this breakdown is prevented .",
    "therefore , minifilaments in the isometric state generate a mean level of force , which depends mainly on the number of motors available for binding , but is robust to variations of elastic properties of the environment . transitions to the state limit the mean force as long as they occur before the stall force of an ensemble in state is reached .",
    "this is the case for the parameters in our model ; for significantly smaller neck linker stiffness as used in ref.@xcite with comparable power - stroke length , the stall force is reduced strongly and could be reached before the transition to the state . for the smaller stall force",
    ", however , catch bonding of motors would not be sufficient to decrease the reverse rate sufficiently to achieve stable attachment .",
    "the mechanosensitivity of minifilaments has important implications for the structure and function of acto - myosin networks . in the actin cortex or reconstituted mixtures of actin with minifilaments , the apparent stiffness of an actin filament depends largely on the level of crosslinking . due to their mechanosensitivity",
    ", minifilaments will most efficiently form crosslinks with and exert force to filaments which are already firmly linked to the network .",
    "loose filaments , on the other hand , which do not contribute to overall network tension , could not be integrated by minifilaments .",
    "this could help to create densely linked networks in which minifilaments provide active crosslinks maintaining a constant level of tension , which is restored after deformations . stretching a network would initially reinforce attachment and prevent rupture of the network . on longer time scales ,",
    "the increased tension would be released by the flow of the network as a consequence of backward stepping of minifilaments .",
    "compression , on the other hand , would reduce the load on the minifilament crosslinks .",
    "subsequent forward movement of ensembles then helps to restore the initial tension in the network .",
    "persistent compression , however , could lead to detachment and network disintegration . in an actin network of random polarity , mechanosensitivity of minifilaments in combination with the asymmetric elasticity of actin filaments",
    "could lead to a selection of filaments according to their orientation , because large forces can be exerted when filaments are stretched , but small forces on filaments buckling under compression @xcite .",
    "this could also contribute to the observed contraction rather than expansion of actin networks of random orientation .",
    "unbalanced preferential attachment to strongly linked filaments could cause aggregation of minifilaments and actin , as it is observed in reconstituted assays @xcite . in adherent cells",
    "elasticity of the extracellular matrix contributes to the effective stiffness experienced by minifilaments .",
    "actin stress fibers tend to form and reinforce at focal contacts on sufficiently stiff substrates @xcite .",
    "mechanosensitivity of minifilaments could contribute to discrimination of substrate stiffness because they are not able to crosslink and to build up forces in soft environments .",
    "although this possible relation is rather speculative at this stage and the exact role of myosin minifilaments in the rigidity response of cells is hard to pin down , it is worth mentioning that activity is an integral part of mechanosensing , which is completely disrupted by inhibiting activity , e.g.  with the pharmacological inhibitor blebbistatin @xcite .    according to our model , the dynamics of minifilaments",
    "is strongly determined by the existence of at least two load bearing bound states of motors . for small load ,",
    "the free energy bias allows the motors to perform the power stroke and complete the motor cycle ; for large load , however , the increase of the elastic energy exceeds the free energy bias and the power stroke can no longer be performed . because the free energy bias is limited by the energy gained in hydrolysis , this transition is inevitable , independent of the parameters .",
    "the exact value of the transition thresholds , however , depends on the stiffness @xmath193 of the neck linkers .",
    "this also means that the value of @xmath193 determines the range of external spring stiffness @xmath169 to which minifilaments are sensitive .",
    "the values for @xmath193 used in the literature range over an order of magnitude , @xmath251 @xcite . although the effect of varying @xmath193 is reduced by combining small @xmath193 with large values of the power - stroke length @xmath22 , small values as in ref .",
    "@xcite could lead to stalling of minifilaments before the transition of the power - stroke probability is reached . unless , however , the unbinding force scale @xmath252 is decreased as well , this stall force would not be enough to achieve stable attachment .",
    "another set of parameters determining the dynamics of minifilaments in our model are the on- and off - rates of motors , which determine the duty ratio .",
    "the load - free duty ratio ( @xmath253 ) of with the transition rates used here is comparable to values reported for non - muscle isoform b but significantly larger than for non - muscle isoform a or smooth muscle .",
    "changes of the transition rates will not change the outcome of the model qualitatively as long as the off - rate from the state is small compared to the off - rate from the state under load .",
    "smaller values of the duty ratio could be compensated by larger ensemble sizes in order to achieve the stabilization of minifilament attachment observed here .",
    "we have further shown with an analytical treatment for the case of minifilaments on rigid substrates that the effective diffusion constant decreases with ensemble size , in marked contrast to the case of the tug - of - war of processive motors , where the diffusion coefficient increases exponentially with the number of motors @xcite .",
    "processive motors are usually described as slip bonds favoring strongly asymmetric states , in which one of the ensembles is completely detached . with increasing number of motors , a tug - of - war of processive motors generates persistent movement in either direction , with exceedingly rare reversal of the direction of motion .",
    "this dependence of the diffusion coefficient on ensemble size is in line with the function of processive motors for transport , which becomes more efficient with increasing number of motors .",
    "non - processive motors , on the other hand , serve as active , force generating crosslinks which are not required to move through the cytoskeleton . an experimental realization of a tug - of - war of two ensembles of non - processive motors , e.g.  using a solid substrate covered by actin filaments with nematic order but random polarity or bipolar actin constructs on a surface covered with motors , could be used to investigate the characteristic difference between processive , slip - bond motors and non - processive , catch - bond motors . in general",
    ", we envision that biomimetic assays provide rewarding avenues to experimentally test our theoretical predictions ."
