    "we have shown that @xmath2 can frustrate the long range spiral magnetic order leading to a spin liquid phase when @xmath168 and a small @xmath169 . since sb - mf is known to favor ordered states @xcite the parameter regime in which the spin liquid phase is stable may be enlarged by fluctuations .",
    "the antiferromagnetic coupling , @xmath2 , considered here may be generated through either , second order , superexchange processes between third nearest - neighbors sites or fourth order processes , that also drive ring exchange .",
    "ring exchange involving four sites can be separated into two - spin @xmath2 heisenberg and four - spin @xcite contributions .",
    "our present analysis , focusing on the frustrating effects associated with the former heisenberg - type exchange terms in the ring exchange , is helpful in the understanding of ring exchange effects in frustrated antiferromagnets .    our analysis may be relevant to recent observations suggesting spin liquid behavior in certain layered materials .",
    "cs@xmath5cubr@xmath6 is an anisotropic triangular material with @xmath170 which would be predicted to be magnetically ordered .",
    "however , from our analysis a rather small @xmath2 would be sufficient to turn it into a spin liquid .",
    "on the other hand , cs@xmath5cucl@xmath6 with @xmath171 would be a spin liquid from our analysis even for @xmath45 which is in contrast with series expansion predictions . in any case , our sb - mf analysis suggests that in these two materials @xmath2 may play a role in determining their magnetic properties @xcite . on the other hand , organic materials",
    "in which spin liquid phases have been found such as @xmath7-(bedt - ttf)@xmath5cu@xmath5(cn)@xmath13 and me@xmath13etsb[pd(dmit)@xmath5]@xmath5 , are in a different parameter regime @xmath172 in which sb - mf would predict an ordered state regardless of @xmath2 unlike the spin liquid predicted by series expansions @xcite for @xmath45 . on the basis of this work",
    ", one would expect a finite @xmath2 to further stabilize the qsl",
    ". it would be interesting to find organic materials which are in the large @xmath1 parameter regime discussed here as they would be strong candidates for the observation of spin liquid behavior .",
    "the sb - mf prediction for the magnetically disordered state is a @xmath173 spin liquid@xcite characterized by gapped bosonic excitations .",
    "however , the @xmath23-dependence of the nmr relaxation rate in cs@xmath5cucl@xmath6 and @xmath7-(bedt - ttf)@xmath5cu@xmath5(cn)@xmath13 suggests the presence of gapless excitations in the system .",
    "this fact can be more naturally explained in terms of fermionic mean - field theories with a ground state consisting of a spinon fermi surface@xcite but is not inconsistent with a bosonic mean - field state of the type described here with spin singlet - triplet gaps which are smaller@xcite than @xmath174 .",
    "further theoretical efforts should concentrate in understanding these observations by going beyond the mean - field theory used here using numerical techniques that can treat the constraint on the number of bosons exactly .",
    "here , we analyze how in the @xmath175 limit the ground state energy obtained from sb - mf converges to the classical ground state energy @xcite .",
    "self - consistent solutions of the bond strengths of the model in the classical limit are given by : @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the distance between two sites forming a bond .",
    "one can check that the classical energy for a given bond is indeed recovered : @xmath178    the boson chemical potential in the magnetically ordered phase is then given by : @xmath179 where we have defined : @xmath180 and the classical energy : @xmath181 .",
    "the mean - field energy referred to the chemical potential obtained from @xmath182 reads : @xmath183 when @xmath184 is large since the sum over @xmath185 in the right hand side of the equation is of o(@xmath184 ) only .",
    "therefore , when @xmath175 the sb - mf energy converges to the classical energy .",
