    "when a glass - forming material is cooled , the motion of the constituents becomes extremely slow .",

    "the red disk caged between two black disks [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] can not pass through between the two disks to the other side unless the gap between the two disks increases up to the diameter of the red disk . likewise , a triangle of three disks constrained by the three surrounding disks [ fig .",
    "1(b ) ] can not rotate unless the top disk shifts upwards such that the two triangles , one of which is formed by the centers of the three caged disks , and the other consists of the centers of the surrounding disks , are perspective from a line ( the extensions of three pairs of corresponding sides of the two triangles meet in collinear points@xcite ) .",
    "if we apply an external force to the red disk to make it pass through between the two caging disks or to the blue disks to rotate the triangle , force carrying networks are formed as shown by the black bonds in fig .",
    "1 provided that the positions of the end disks are fixed . if we place hinges at the centers of the disks connected by rigid bonds rotating freely around the hinges , the networks in fig",
    ".  1 are rigid and isostatic@xcite , such that any removal of a bond results in a network that is not rigid .",
    "if the number of the caged disk is @xmath1 , the number of columns of the matrix is @xmath2 ( there are two bonds in fig .",
    "1(a ) ( @xmath3 ) and six bonds in fig .",
    "1(b ) ( @xmath4 ) ) .",
    "this is a property of an isostatic network .    in the disk system ,",
    "the combination of the colliding pair of the caged disks does not change for a short timescale . from the list of colliding pairs ,",
    "we can construct a network where each bond represents the colliding disk pair .",
    "if a disk ( or a set of disks ) is caged , we can find a set of bonds corresponding to those shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this is because the condition of uncaging shown in fig .",
    "1 is the same even if the disks move and collide with each other .",
    "therefore , we can define an isostatic sub  network in the network as a cage . this local sub ",
    "network of bonds is called the locally rigid framework ( lrf). an lrf inhibits the motion of a disk ( or a set of disks ) in one particular direction .",
    "if all lrfs pertaining to a disk are effective , the disk can only rattle inside the cage .",
    "it should be noted that this network is not a real contact network , but a fictitious one because the disks do not continue to contact but they collide .",

    "an uncaging event can be detected by the rigidity matrix@xcite .",
    "we can construct the rigidity matrix from the lrf such that each row represents a bond and each column corresponds to the coordinates of caged disks .",
    "an lrf consists of bonds inside caged disks in addition to bonds connecting between a caged disk and a neighboring caging disk .",

    "1(b ) , there are three bonds inside the caged disks ( blue ) and three bonds connecting the caged disks and caging disks ( black ) .",
    "if there are bonds between the caged disks 1  2 and 2  3 , the rigidity matrix is written as@xcite    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the positions of the @xmath8-th disk , and @xmath9 is the distance between the centers of disks @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",

    "the rigidity matrix for an isostatic network is a square matrix ( the number of degrees of freedom of the caged disks @xmath2 and the number of bonds are the same in an isostatic network@xcite ) and has a determinant except for a special position of the disks@xcite when uncaging occurs .",
    "when the red disk passes between the other two disks in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the determinant of the lrf becomes zero because the two bonds are in parallel when the three centers of the disks are collinear .",
    "the determinant changes its sign at this point .",

    "the number of chosen bonds is usually more than that required for an isostatic network .",
    "this is because the disks move and have a chance to collide with more disks than when they are tightly packed .",
    "overconstraining bonds ( their removal does not affect the rigidity of the network ) are randomly removed until the isostatic condition@xcite is fulfilled .",
    "an example of an isostatic network is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "if a bond is further removed from the isostatic network , some fraction of the bonds becomes mobile .",
    "correspondingly , a disk ( or a set of disks ) also becomes mobile ( rotates around a disk center ) .",
    "for example , if we remove a blue bond at the bottom of fig .  2 , another blue bond becomes mobile and the disk connected by this blue bond can rotate around .",
    "we can find a minimum set of mobile bonds among @xmath2 possible bond removals .",
    "the mobile bonds can be found by the pebble game algorithm@xcite .",
    "in addition to the removed bond , the induced mobile bonds are further removed from the isostatic network . in the example",

    "a determinant of an lrf can be decomposed into factors corresponding to triangles and to connecting bonds between triangles .",
    "a factor for a triangle can not change its sign because the lrf is broken before the change .",

    "this difference is the origin of the gap in uncaging times .",
    "an lrf with small @xmath50 uncages faster .",
    "however , an lrf consisting of tightly packed disks sustains for a long time .",
    "these observations suggest that the uncaging of lrfs of @xmath23 with a bond ( @xmath43 ) requires the uncaging of other lrfs .",
    "uncaging of lrfs with @xmath65 and @xmath23 without a bond proceeds during the plateau of the intermediate scattering function .",
    "the lrfs relaxed in the first stage flip over again between the neighboring configurations as shown in the left and right panels in fig .  1 .",
    "the system gradually changes its configuration by the flipping of the weak lrfs relaxed in the first stage .",
    "the plateau shows that the disk system requires time to find a configuration to open a path between two disks packed initially with an order .",
    "displacements of disks due to the uncaging of these lrfs are small , and can be seen as a plateau of the mean square displacement when @xmath66 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "this period corresponds to @xmath67 relaxation of glass forming materials@xcite .",
    "disk positions gradually change in this period and the distance between two caging disks in lrfs with @xmath3 with a bond , enlarges .",
    "the uncaging of lrfs with @xmath3 with a bond triggers a large structural change and promotes the second relaxation of @xmath49 .",
    "this period corresponds to @xmath68 relaxation of glass forming materials@xcite .",
    "the requirement of uncaging of other types of lrfs for lrfs with @xmath3 with a bond is the situation of `` constrained dynamics''@xcite which explains the slow relaxation of glass - forming systems . according to this study , uncaging of lrfs @xmath3 with a bond",
    "can not take place by itself . through the uncaging of lrfs with @xmath65 and @xmath3 without a bond ,",
    "the arrangement of the disks changes so that uncaging of lrfs @xmath3 with a bond takes place .",
    "an lrf with @xmath3 with a bond is the collection of locally ordered packing of three disks because the three disks collide with each other when the network is determined .",
    "this local order can not propagate throughout because of the poly - dispersity of the disks .",
    "this situation is called the geometrical frustration@xcite . because of the lack of the long - range order , the geometrical frustration inevitably leads to the formation of weak lrfs , which are uncaged first .    in conclusion ,",
