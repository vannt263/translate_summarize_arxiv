    "when it comes to the task of transferring energy , nature has at its disposal tools such as electromagnetic radiation , conduction by electricity and also heat .",
    "the latter two tools play a dominant role from a technological viewpoint .",
    "the conduction of heat and electric conduction are , however , two fundamental energy transport mechanisms of comparable importance , although never been treated equally in science .",
    "modern information processing rests on micro electronics , which after the invention of the electronic solid - state transistor @xcite , and other related devices , sparked off an unparalleled technological development , the state of the art being electric integrated circuitry . without any doubt , this technology markedly changed many aspects of our daily life .",
    "unfortunately , a similar technology which builds on electronic analogs via the constructive use of heat flow has not yet been realized by mankind , although several attempts have been repeatedly undertaken . in everyday life , however , signals encoded by heat prevail over those by electricity .",
    "therefore , the potential of using heat control may result in an even more abundant and unforseen wealth of applications .",
    "a legitimate question then is : does phononics , i.e. , the counterpart technology of electronics present only a dream ?    admittedly , it indeed is substantially more difficult to control _ a priori _ the flow of heat in a solid than it is to control the flow of electrons .",
    "the source of this imbalance is that , unlike electrons , the carriers of heat  the phonons  are quasi - particles in the form of energy bundles that possess neither a bare mass nor a bare charge .",
    "although isolated phonons by itself do not influence each other , interactions involving phonons become of importance in the presence of condensed phases . some examples that come to mind",
    "are phonon polaritons , i.e. the interaction of optical phonons with infrared photons , the generic phonon - electron interactions occurring in metals and semi - metal structures , phonon - spin interactions , or the phonon - phonon interaction in presence of nonlinearity",
    ". therefore , heat flow features aspects which in many ways are distinct from charge and matter flow .",
    "nonetheless , there occur in condensed phases many interesting cross - interplays as it is encoded with the reciprocal relations of the onsager form for mass , heat and charge flow , of which thermoelectricity @xcite or thermophoresis , i.e. the soret _ vs. _ its reciprocal dufour effect @xcite , are typical exemplars .",
    "therefore , capitalizing on the rich physical diversities involving phonon transport as obtained with recent successes in nano - technology may open the door to turn phononics from a dream into a reality .    with this colloquium",
    "we shall focus on two fundamental issues of phononics ; - i.e. the manipulation of heat energy flow on the nanoscale and the objective of processing information by utilizing phonons .",
    "more precisely , we shall investigate the possibilities to devise elementary building blocks for doing phononics ; namely we study the conceptual realization and its possible operation of a thermal diode which rectifies heat current , a thermal transistor that is capable to switch and amplify heat flow and last but not least a thermal memory device .",
    "the objective of controlling heat flow on the nanoscale necessarily rests on the microscopic laws that govern heat conduction , stability aspects or thermometric issues . for these latter themes",
    "the literature provides the readers with several comprehensive reviews and features already . for heat flow and/or related thermoelectric phenomena on the micro-/nano- and molecular scales",
    "we refer the readers to the excellent treatises by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and recently also by @xcite .",
    "we further demarcate our presentation from the subjects of refrigeration on mesoscopic scales and thermometry @xcite and , as well , as our title suggests , also do not address _ per se _ in greater detail the issue of conventional way of manipulating heat flow upon changing thermal conductivity by means of various phonon scattering mechanisms in nano- and heterostructures @xcite .",
    "for compelling recent developments and advances in this latter area we refer the interested readers to the recent surveys by @xcite and @xcite , together with the original literature cited therein .    in this spirit ,",
    "a primary building block for doing phononics is a setup that rectifies heat flow ; i.e. a thermal rectifier / diode .",
    "such a device acts as a thermal conductor if a positive thermal bias is applied while in the opposite case of a negative thermal bias it undergoes poor thermal conduction , thus effectively acting as a thermal insulator , or possibly also vice versa .",

    "sketch of the _ modus operandi _ of a thermal diode . when the left end of the diode is at a higher temperature as compared to its right counterpart heat is allowed to flow almost freely .",
    "in contrast , when the right end is made hotter in reference to the left end the transduction of heat becomes strongly diminished.,width=264 ]    the concept of a thermal diode involves , just as in its electronic counterpart , the presence of a symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "this symmetry breaking is most conveniently realized by merging two materials exhibiting different heat transport characteristics .",
    "historically , @xcite working at rensselaer polytechnic institute in new york built a junction composed of a metallic copper part which he joined with its cuprous oxide phase ; thus proving the working principle of rectifying heat in such a structure .",
    "starr s thermal rectifier is physically based on an asymmetric electron - phonon interaction occurring in the interface of the two dissimilar materials .",
    "there exist a plenty of such macroscopic rectifiers which function via the difference of the material response due to temperature bias and/or other externally applied control fields such as strain , etc .",
    ", @xcite .",
    "the focus in this colloquium will be on a thermal rectification scenario that is induced by phonon transport occurring on the nanoscale .",
    "the concept of such a thermal rectifier for heat was put forward by @xcite .",
    "the authors therein proposed to use a three - segment structure composed of different nonlinear lattice segments .",
    "the underlying physical mechanism relies on the resonance phenomenon for the temperature dependent power spectrum _ vs. _ frequency as a result of the nonlinear lattice dynamics .",
    "subsequently , it has been shown that a modified two - segment setup @xcite yields considerably improved rectification characteristics as compared to the original three - segment setup @xcite . these pioneering works in turn ignited a flurry of activities , manifesting different advantageous features and characteristics .",
    "the theoretical and numerical efforts culminated in a first experimental validation of such a thermal rectifier in 2006 : the device itself is based on an asymmetric nanotube structure @xcite .",
    "the concept of this latter thermal diode together with its explicit experimental setup is depicted with fig .",
    "[ fig : intro_exp ] .",
    "the thermal diode presents an important first step towards phononics . for performing logic operations and useful circuitry ,",
    "however , additional control mechanisms for heat are required .",
    "this comprises the task of devising ( i ) the thermal analog of an electronic transistor , ( ii ) thermal logic gates and , as well , ( iii ) a thermal memory .",
    "the physical concept of these salient phononic building blocks will be elucidated in sect .",
    "ii . the main physical feature that enters the function of such phonon devices is the occurrence of _ negative differential thermal resistance _ ( ndtr ) ; the latter being a direct consequence of the inherently acting nonlinear dynamics with its intriguing nonlinear response to an externally applied thermal bias .    with sect .",
    "iii we investigate how to put these thermal phononic concepts to `` action '' by using realistic nanoscale structures .",
    "the actual operations of such devices rest on extended molecular dynamics simulations which serve as a guide for implementing its experimental realization .",
    "the control of heat flow in the above mentioned phononic building blocks is managed mainly by applying a _",
    "static _ thermal bias .",
    "more intriguing control of transport emerges when the manipulations are made explicitly time - dependent or by use of different external forces such as the application of magnetic fields . as detailed with sec .",
    "iv such manipulation scenarios then generate new roadways towards fine - tuned control and counterintuitive response behaviors . originally , such dynamic control has been implemented for anomalous particle transport by taking the system dynamics out - of - equilibrium : doing so results in intriguing phenomena such as brownian motor ( ratchet - like ) transport , absolute negative mobility and alike @xcite .",
    "a similar reasoning can be put to work for shuttling _ heat _ in appropriately designed lattice structures , as detailed in sect .",
    "iv . in sect .",
    "v , we summarize our main findings , discuss yet some additional elements for phononic concepts and reflect on future potential and visions to advance the field of phononics from its present infancy towards a mature level .",
    "the task of directing heat for information processing as in electronics requires a toolkit with suitable building blocks , namely those nonlinear components that mimic the role of diodes , transistors , and alike , known from electronic circuitry .",
    "a first challenge then is to design the blueprints for such components that function for heat control analogous to the building blocks for electronics .",
    "this objective is best approached by making use of the nonlinear dynamics present in anharmonic lattice structures in combination with the implementation of a system inherent symmetry breaking .",
    "we start with the discussion of the theoretical design for thermal diodes that rectify heat flow .      in order to achieve thermal rectification",
    ", we exploit the nonlinear response mechanism as it derives from inherent temperature - dependent power spectra .",
    "an everyday analog of such a nonlinear frequency response is a playground swing when driven into its large amplitude regime via parametric resonance .",
    "the response is optimized whenever the natural frequencies match those of the perturbations .",
    "likewise , energy can be transported across two different segments when the corresponding vibrational frequency response characteristics overlap .    more precisely , whenever the power spectrum in one part of the device matches with its neighboring part , we find that heat energy is exchanged efficiently . in the absence of such overlapping spectral properties ,",
    "the exchange of energy becomes strongly diminished .",
    "particularly , the response behavior of realistic materials is typically anharmonic by nature . as a consequence ,",
    "the corresponding power spectra become strongly dependent on temperature , see in appendix a , subsect .",
    "if an asymmetric system is composed of different parts with differing physical parameters the resulting temperature - dependence of the power spectra will differ likewise .",
    "based on these insights , a possible working principle of a thermal diode goes as follows : if a temperature bias makes the spectral features of different parts overlap with each other , we obtain a favorable energy exchange .",
    "in contrast , if for the opposite temperature bias the spectral properties of the different parts fail to overlap appreciably a strong suppression of heat transfer occurs . in summary",

    "( b ) in the case that the temperature @xmath1 in the left segment is colder than the corresponding right temperature @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath3 , the power spectrum of the particle motions of the left segment is weighted at high frequencies .",
    "this is so because of the difficulty experienced by the dwelling particles to overcome the large barriers of the on - site potential .",

    "the overlap of the spectra is weak , implying that the heat current @xmath4 becomes strongly diminished .",
    "( c ) here the situation is opposite to panel ( b ) . with @xmath5",
    "the particles can now move almost freely between neighboring barriers .",

    "because the power spectra of an arbitrary nonlinear material typically become temperature - dependent , the use of any asymmetric nonlinear system is expected to display an inequivalent heat transport upon reversal of the temperature bias .",
    "it is , however , not a simple task to design a device that results in physical designated and technologically feasible thermal diode properties . after having investigated a series of possible setups we designed a thermal diode model that performs efficiently over a wide range of system parameters @xcite .",
    "the blueprint of this device consists of two nonlinear segments which are weakly coupled by a linear spring with strength @xmath8 .",
    "each segment is composed of a chain of particles in which each individual particle is coupled with its nearest neighbors by linear springs .",
    "this whole nonlinear two - segment chain is each subjected to a cosinusoidal varying on - site potential ; the latter is provided by the coupling to a substrate .",

    "the scheme of this thermal diode is depicted in fig .",

    "the key feature of this fk - diode setup is the chosen difference in the strength of the corresponding on - site potential . at low temperature ,",

    "the particles assume sufficiently large kinetic energies so that thermal activation @xcite across the inhibiting barriers becomes feasible . the corresponding power spectrum",

    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : jdelta](a ) , we achieve the desired strong thermal rectification .",
    "note that the barrier height of the on - site potential for the right segment is chosen sufficiently small so that the corresponding particles are allowed to move almost freely , both in the low and in the high temperature regime . in the case that the left end is set at the low temperature , its power spectrum is weighted within the high frequency regime .",

    "it is defined as , @xmath21 , where @xmath4 is the heat flow ( per area ) and @xmath22 denotes the temperature jump between two sides of the interface . the origin of the kapitza resistance can be traced back to the heterogeneous electronic and/or vibrational properties of the different materials making up the interface at which the energy carriers become scattered .",
    "the amount of relative transmission depends on the available energy states on either of the two sides of the interface .",
    "originally , this phenomenon was discovered by kapitza in 1941 in experiments detecting super - fluidity of he ii @xcite .",
    "the high thermal rectification in the above discussed model setups is mainly due to this interface effect . in order to further improve the performance @xcite studied the itr in a lattice consisting of two weakly coupled , dissimilar anharmonic segments , exemplified by a ( fk)-chain segment and a neighboring fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu)-chain segment .",

    "the physical mechanism of the asymmetric itr between dissimilar anharmonic lattices can therefore be related to the match / mismatch of the corresponding power spectra . as temperature increases ,",
    "the power spectrum of the fk lattice shifts downwards , towards lower frequencies .",
    "in contrast , the power spectrum of the fpu - segment , however , shifts upwards , towards higher frequencies . due to these opposing shifts ,",
    "it becomes evident that upon a reversing the thermal bias the amount of match / mismatch in such a fk - fpu setup can even exceed that of the above considered fk - fk setup .",
    "conceptually this results in an even stronger thermal rectification .",
    "the design and the experimental realization of the thermal diode presents a striking first step towards the goal of doing phononics .",
    "a next challenge to be overcome is then a design for a thermal transistor , which allows for an _ a priori _ control of heat flow much alike the familiar control of charge flow in a field effect transistor . like its electronic counterpart ,",
    "a thermal transistor consists of three terminals : the drain ( d ) , the source ( s ) , and the gate ( g ) .",
    "when a constant temperature bias is applied between the drain and the source , the thermal current flowing between source and drain can be fine - tuned by the temperature that is applied to the gate .",
    "most importantly , because the transistor is able to amplify a signal , the changes in the heat current through the gate can induce an even larger current change from the drain to the source .    towards the eventual realization of such a thermal transistor device",
    "we consider the concept depicted with fig .",

    "the corresponding thermal rectification increases upon raising the temperature bias .",
    "another beneficial feature is that the rectification is only weakly dependent on the detailed structure of the interface , assuming that the connecting region is sufficiently short .",
    "this is so because heat is predominantly carried by long wavelength phonons , which are scattered mainly by large defects .",

    "it was found that the nanocone behaves as a `` good '' thermal conductor under positive thermal bias and as a `` poor '' thermal conductor when exposed to a negative thermal bias .",
    "this suggests that the heat flux runs preferentially along the direction of decreasing diameter .    in order to compare the impact of mass - asymmetry versus geometry - asymmetry for thermal rectification a nanocone structure with a graded mass distribution",

    "the mass of the atoms of the nanocone are devised to change linearly ; that is , the top atoms possess a minimum mass @xmath109 and the bottom atoms are at the maximum mass of @xmath110 , with @xmath109 being the mass of @xmath111 atom .",
    "nemd results then yield a rectification ratio , @xmath112 , that is @xmath113 for a nanocone with uniform masses and is @xmath114 for the mass - graded nanocone ( at identical thermal bias @xmath6 ) .",
    "this 2% increase for the mass - graded distribution evidences that the role of geometric asymmetry is more effective in boosting thermal rectification .",
    "these geometric asymmetric swcnt junctions all exhibit thermal rectification . compared to the swcnt setup , it is easier , however , to control the shape of graphene by the nano cutting technology such as helium ion microscope .",
    "graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) , cf . fig .",

    "they studied the direction dependent heat flux in asymmetric structural gnrs , and explored the impacts of both , gnr shape and size , for the rectification ratio .",
    "two types of gnrs were considered : trapezia - shaped gnr and two - rectangular gnrs of different width , fig .",

    "these two types of gnrs behave as a `` good '' thermal conductors under positive thermal bias ( i.e. bottom end at higher temperature ) and as a `` poor '' thermal conductor under negative thermal bias ( i.e. top end at higher temperature ) .",
    "this finding is similar to the rectification phenomena observed in carbon nanocone structures @xcite , which again results from the amount of match / mismatch between the respective phonon spectra .",
    "it is interesting to note that the rectification ratios of gnrs are substantially larger than those in nanocone and swcnt junctions . with @xmath6=0.5 ,",
    "the rectification ratio of the nanocone is @xmath115 @xcite and that of swcnt intramolecular junction is only around @xmath116 @xcite , while the rectification ratio in gnrs is about @xmath117 and @xmath118 for two - rectangular gnrs and the trapezia - shaped gnr , respectively .",
    "the rectification ratio of trapezia - shaped gnr is thus larger than that of two - rectangular gnr under the same thermal bias difference .",
    "this feature is consistent with the phenomenon that the carbon nanocone ( i.e. the geometric graded structure ) possesses a larger rectification ratio than the two - segment carbon nanotube ( n , 0)/(2n , 0 ) intra - molecular junction .",
    "the phonon spectra change continuously in the graded structures which implies a more efficient control of heat flux .",
    "similar rectification features were observed in graphene nanoribbons by @xcite .",

    "are saturated when the gnr length is longer than @xmath121 5.1 nm , yielding that the rectification ratio remains constant around 92% .",
    "moreover , compared to a setup composed of a single - layer graphene , an even larger rectification ratio can be achieved in few - layer asymmetric structures , this being a consequence of layer - layer interactions @xcite .",
    "thermal rectification can also be realized with a topological graphene setup such as the mbius graphene strip @xcite , fig . [",

    "the advantage of this topology induced thermal",
    "rectification is that it is practically insensitive to temperature and size of the system . in this structure ,",
    "the asymmetry originates from the intrinsic topological configuration .    because phonons are strongly scattered due to the mismatch in vibrational properties of the materials forming the interface , which in addition depends on the sign of applied thermal bias , this produces an asymmetric kapitza contact resistance .",

    "let us reflect again on the choice of materials suitable in obtaining those theoretically predicted thermal rectification features .",
    "a thermal rectifier constitutes a two - terminal thermal device whose working principle rests upon the different overlap of the temperature dependent phonon spectra .",
    "for this to occur strong anharmonicity plays an important factor . given the above discussion of geometric asymmetric structures a strong intrinsic anharmonicity corresponds to diffusive phonon transport .",
    "however , diffusive phonon transport presents not a necessary condition for thermal rectification . in the asymmetric gnrs ,",
    "phonon transport is almost ballistic .",
    "the conclusion is that thermal rectification exists for both , ballistic and diffusive phonon transport , assuming that a match / mismatch of the phonon spectrum of the two ends is present .",

    "the heat flow in the phe is ascribed to two separate contributions : the normal flow responsible for the longitudinal phonon transport , and the anomalous flow manifesting itself as the hall effect of the transverse phonon transport .",
    "a general expression for the transverse phonon hall conductivity is obtained in terms of the berry curvature of phononic band structures .",
    "the associated topological chern number ( a quantized integer ) for each phonon band is defined via integrating the berry curvature over the first brillouin zone .",
    "for the two dimensional honeycomb and kagome - lattice , the authors observed phase transitions in the phe , which correspond to the sudden change of the underlying band topology .",

    "therefore , much alike for electrons in topological insulators @xcite , the design of a family of novel phononic devices ",
    "topological thermal insulators  is promising , with the bulk being an ordinary thermal insulator while the edge / surface constitutes an extraordinary thermal conductor .",
    "with this colloquium we took the reader on a tour presenting the state of the art of the topic termed ` phononics ' , an emerging research direction which is expected to chime in the future with conventional ` electronics ' .",
    "particularly , we surveyed and explained various physical mechanisms that are exploited in devising the elementary phononic toolkit : namely , a thermal diode / rectifier , thermal transistor , thermal logic gate and thermal memory . these building blocks for doing phononic",
    "electronics are rooted in the application of suitable static or dynamic control schemes for shuttling heat .",
    "we further reviewed recent attempts to realize such phononic devices which all are based on nanostructures and discussed first experimental realizations .      in spite of the rapid developments of phononics in both science and technology",
    ", we should stress that this objective is still at its outset . to put these phononic devices to work ,",
    "there remain lots of ambitious theoretical and severe experimental challenges to be overcome .",
    "for example , much work is still required for the physical realization of the phononic toolbox and for entering the next stage of assembling operating networks that are both scalable and stable under ambient conditions .    _",
    "theory._ interface thermal resistance . as we have pointed out the underlying mechanism for thermal rectifier / diode",
    "is based on an asymmetric interface thermal resistance . however , thus far a truly comprehensive theory for this effect is lacking .    the current approaches for thermal transport across an interface , such as the acoustic mismatch ( amm ) theory @xcite and the diffusive mismatch ( dmm ) theory @xcite ,",
    "are based on the assumption that phonon transport proceeds via a combination of either ballistic or diffusive transport on either side of the interface .",
    "both schemes offer limited accuracy for nanoscale interfacial resistance predictions @xcite , due to the neglect of the atomic details of actual interfaces .",
    "specifically , the acoustic mismatch model assumes that phonons are transported across the interface without being scattered ; i.e. they are ballistic while the diffuse mismatch model assumes the opposite , namely that the phonons are scattered diffusively .",
    "thus , the effects of scattering on the interfacial thermal resistance act as upper and lower limits for real situation .",
    "in fact , both numerical and experimental studies in nanostructures ranging from nanotubes @xcite , nanowires @xcite , to polyethylene nanofibers @xcite all show that phonons undergo anomalous diffusion - i.e. so termed superdiffusion - , being faster than normal diffusion but slower than ballistic transport .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to establish an improved theory describing thermal transport across the interface by taking into account the anomalous thermal transport characteristics of nanostructures .",
    "yet another fact of thermal rectification and negative differential thermal resistance is the role of ( strong ) nonlinearity . how to set up a transport theory by incorporating nonlinearity in both , the quantum regime and the classical regime presents a challenge .",
    "the non - equilibrium green s ( negf ) function method @xcite certainly serves as an elegant mathematical framework .",
    "however , when sophisticated phonon - phonon interactions ( which derive from anharmonicity ) , and alike , become increasingly important ( this being so in realistic nanostructures ) , the negf presents a cumbersome task . in the classical regime ,",
    "an effective phonon theory has proven useful in characterizing heat conduction @xcite .",
    "several classical studies have been advanced @xcite , which may as well be extended into the quantum regime .    _",
    "experiment._experimental realization of practical phononic device depends on how to measure its thermal conductivity accurately . to this end , one needs to get rid of the contact thermal resistance .",
    "thus far no well defined scheme capable to eradicate such contact thermal resistance has been put forward .    it also should be noted that presently the prime elementary phononic building block , i.e. the thermal rectifier , has been realized on the micrometer scale @xcite and on the millimeter scale @xcite only . the challenge for experimentalists is to make the sample smaller , for example towards a dozens of nanometers or even a few nanometers only .",
    "this then would boost the rectification to much larger values and simultaneously would allow detecting the asymmetric interface thermal resistance .",
    "the primary challenge ahead , however , is to validate the negative differential thermal resistance , i.e. the key element necessary in realizing the thermal transistor .    for electronic - like function",
    "a networking towards a phononic - like logic operation is indispensable . in the event",
    "that this task could be achieved successfully could then facilitate the desirable operation of an all - phononic computer .      as emphasized above",
    ", the area of phononics lingers still in its infancy , yet it is at the verge of blossoming up . + _ from phononics to acoustics , and vice versa . _  as we elucidated throughout this colloquium the physical principle of phononic devices rests in the manipulation of phonon bands / spectra .",
    "this idea can be generalized to control any elastic / mechanical energy .",
    "for example , inspired by the thermal diode , an acoustic diode has been proposed by @xcite and subsequently realized experimentally by use of a nonlinear acoustic medium and phononic crystal @xcite , and a sonic crystal geometry @xcite .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated experimentally elastic energy switching and rectification .",
    "there is little doubt that in parallel to phononics , namely an acoustic transistor , logic gate and possibly even a computer device may be realized in the foreseeable future .",
    "the ideas and concepts in controlling acoustic waves can as well be exploited for phononics .",
    "for example , phononic crystals have been demonstrated to be useful in manipulating acoustic wave propagation @xcite .",
    "this concept has been extended recently to control heat flow on the nanoscale @xcite .",
    "it would not come as a too big surprise when someday concepts such as a `` heat - cloak '' , `` super heat lens '' , etc .",
    ", come alive via the implementation of phononic concepts by use of acoustic meta - materials @xcite .",
    "in fact , active research is presently pursued in controlling and manipulating mechanical / elastic energy which ranges from long wavelength elastic waves to very short wavelength thermal waves , a glimpse of this activity can be adapted from the proceedings of the world first conference on ` phononics ' @xcite .",
    "_ phoxonics : phononics plus photonics , and beyond .",
    "_  another promising prospect is based on the combination of phononics with photonics to control and manage photon and phonon energy concomitantly @xcite .",
    "this synergy might potentially enable one to use the solar energy more wisely .",
    "for instance , a single - molecule phonon field - effect transistor has been designed wherein phonon conductance is controlled by a back - gate electric field @xcite . moreover , as temperature is the commonly applied control parameter for chemical and biological reactions , phononic devices may also find application for the local control of temperatures , for example in regulating molecular self - assembling processes with the `` lab - on - a - chip '' technology . _",
    "phononics and electronics . _",
    " electrons carry as well heat .",
    "therefore one can control the heat flow carried by electrons with the help of electric / magnetic fields .",
    "for example , by asymmetrically coupling a quantum dot to its two leads one can construct a heat rectifier @xcite ;  upon applying a gate voltage it is possible to operate a heat transistor @xcite .",
    "these kind of devices combined with phononic circuits may then carry the potential to manipulate dissipation of heat and cooling in nanoscale and molecular devices .",
    "overall , there is also the potential that hybrid structures composed of electronic and phononic elements may lead to beneficial applications .    _ from heat conduction to radiation._ in this colloquium , our proposed phononic devices are based on the control of heat conduction , being assisted by lattice vibrations .",
    "a similar idea can be generalized to control heat radiation .",
    "indeed , fan and collaborators at stanford proposed a photon - mediated `` thermal rectifier through vacuum '' @xcite which makes constructive use of the temperature dependence of underlying electro - magnetic resonances . in the same spirit ,",
    "fan s group @xcite revealed negative differential thermal conductance through vacuum ; this in turn allows for the blueprint of a transistor for heat radiation .",

    "<S> the form of energy termed heat that typically derives from lattice vibrations , i.e. the phonons , is usually considered as waste energy and , moreover , deleterious to information processing . </S>",
    "<S> however , with this colloquium , we attempt to rebut this common view : by use of tailored models we demonstrate that phonons can be manipulated like electrons and photons can , thus enabling controlled heat transport . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we explain that phonons can be put to beneficial use to carry and process information . in a first part we present ways to control heat transport and how to process information for physical systems which are driven by a temperature bias . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , we put forward the toolkit of familiar electronic analogs for exercising phononics ; i.e. phononic devices which act as thermal diodes , thermal transistors , thermal logic gates and thermal memories , etc .. these concepts are then put to work to transport , control and rectify heat in physical realistic nanosystems by devising practical designs of hybrid nanostructures that permit the operation of functional phononic devices and , as well , report first experimental realizations . </S>",
    "<S> next , we discuss yet richer possibilities to manipulate heat flow by use of time varying thermal bath temperatures or various other external fields . these give rise to a plenty of intriguing phononic nonequilibrium phenomena as for example the directed shuttling of heat , a geometrical phase induced heat pumping , or the phonon hall effect , that all may find its way into operation with electronic analogs . + </S>"
