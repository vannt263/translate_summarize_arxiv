    "long - period moir patterns are characteristic of well - aligned graphene heterostructures with hbn .",
    "they offer an experimentally - viable route @xcite to observe fractal magnetic miniband spectra generic for electrons in two - dimensional superlattices in strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "these fractal miniband spectra , also known as hofstadter s butterflies @xcite , reflect the fact that the translational symmetry of a lattice , suppressed by the presence of a magnetic vector potential in the electron s schrdinger equation , is restricted to magnetic field values @xmath0 corresponding to a rational fraction @xmath1 of magnetic flux quantum @xmath2 per unit cell area @xmath3 of the lattice @xcite .",
    "the generic features of fractal magnetic miniband spectra have been observed @xcite and modeled @xcite in monolayer graphene heterostructures with hbn , where the properties of dirac electrons at the conduction / valence band edge allow for a straightforward interpretation of experimental observations , and have also been studied in slightly misaligned pairs of graphene flakes @xcite .",
    "modeling of the fractal magnetic miniband spectra of a bilayer graphene / hbn heterostructure is much more limited @xcite , even though one of the first observations of this phenomena was in this system  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we study fractal magnetic minibands in bilayer graphene ( blg ) subject to a moir superlattice perturbation due to an hbn underlay .",
    "the low - energy hofstadter butterfly spectra of a blg - hbn heterostructure is dominated by bands related to the degenerate `` zero - energy '' landau level ( ll ) states @xmath4 and @xmath5 of unperturbed blg @xcite .",
    "we use a symmetry - based approach to model the influence of hbn on electrons in blg , and we show that the spectra in blg - hbn is a superposition of two very different miniband spectra associated with electrons in opposite valleys ( brillouin zone corners ) of blg s band structure : the miniband spectrum in one valley is only weakly broadened by the superlattice potential and incorporates one unperturbed @xmath4 ll , while the miniband spectrum in the other valley is widely broadened .",
    "this valley asymmetry arises from spatial inversion symmetry breaking produced by the fact that the moir perturbation only directly affects one of the two blg layers .",
    "since the zero energy ll states reside on different layers in opposite valleys , in one valley they are strongly influenced by the moir perturbation , but in the other valley they are not .",
    "these qualitative features agree with the results of the tight - binding model of moon and koshino @xcite .",
    "in addition , we characterize different types of moir superlattice perturbations including the possibilities that the perturbation creates potential asymmetry between the carbon atoms in blg or introduces a spatial modulation of the nearest - neighbor carbon - carbon hopping amplitude .",
    "hence , we find that the dirac point at the conduction - valence band edge can be either gapless or gapped , and that a secondary dirac point can appear in the valence band of blg - hbn .",

    "<S> we investigate the magnetic minibands of a heterostructure consisting of bilayer graphene ( blg ) and hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) by numerically diagonalizing a two - band hamiltonian that describes electrons in blg in the presence of a moir potential . due to </S>",
    "<S> inversion - symmetry breaking characteristic for the moir potential , the valley symmetry of the spectrum is broken , but despite this , the zero - energy landau level in blg survives , albeit with reduced degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we derive effective models for the low - energy features in the magnetic minibands and demonstrate the appearance of secondary dirac points in the valence band , which we confirm by numerical simulations . then , we analyze how single - particle gaps in the fractal energy spectrum produce a sequence of incompressible states observable under a variation of carrier density and magnetic field . </S>"
