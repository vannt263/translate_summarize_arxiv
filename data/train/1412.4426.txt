    "<S> in this paper we conduct a careful multicanonical simulation of the isotropic @xmath0 plaquette ( `` gonihedric '' ) ising model and confirm that a planar , fuki - nuke type order characterises the low - temperature phase of the model . from consideration of the anisotropic limit of the model </S>",
    "<S> we define a class of order parameters which can distinguish the low- and high - temperature phases in both the anisotropic and isotropic cases . </S>",
    "<S> we also verify the recently voiced suspicion that the order parameter like behaviour of the standard magnetic susceptibility @xmath1 seen in previous metropolis simulations was an artefact of the algorithm failing to explore the phase space of the macroscopically degenerate low - temperature phase . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 is therefore not a suitable order parameter for the model . </S>"
