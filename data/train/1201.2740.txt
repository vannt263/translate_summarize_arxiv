    "since the celebrated work of anderson @xcite and others about half a century ago , the subject of disorder and quantum phase transitions induced by disorder continues to attract interest @xcite . in spite of being intensively studied , the interplay between interactions and disorder remains an open frontier . in recent years",
    ", a new impetus toward the understanding of disorder systems has emerged in the context of ultracold atomic systems because of their extraordinary degree of tunability . in those systems",
    ", it is now possible to control the degree of disorder either by imprinting speckle patterns @xcite or by superimposing a secondary lattice on the main lattice to generate a quasiperiodic potential @xcite . using those techniques ,",
    "anderson localization has already been observed in one dimension @xcite . at the same time , the possibility of exploring strongly interacting regimes with ultra - cold atoms has been demonstrated by observation of the superfluid to mott insulator transition @xcite , and the realization of the tonks - girardeau gas , i.e. , a gas of impenetrable ( hard - core ) bosons ( hcbs ) , in one dimension @xcite . the combined investigation of the effect of disorder and correlations in low - dimensional systems is therefore a window that is now open for experimental exploration @xcite and has driven many recent investigations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the problem of one - dimensional ( 1d ) hcbs with pseudo - random disorder generated by imposing two - color lattices with periods that are mutually incommensurate . even in the absence of interactions ,",
    "one - dimensional quasiperiodic systems exhibit a localization - delocalization transition .",
    "in contrast to truly random 1d systems where states are localized irrespective of the strength of disorder , quasiperiodic systems exhibit a quantum phase transition from extended to localized at a finite strength of the quasiperiodic disorder . in the interacting soft - core regime , several studies have addressed the phases that result from the interplay between pseudorandom disorder and strong correlations .",
    "those studies have utilized different computational techniques such as exact diagonalization @xcite , quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , and the density - matrix renormalization group method @xcite .",
    "a recent comprehensive discussion of these , and other , results can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we perform an exact numerical study of ultracold bosons in the hard - core regime , as well as spinless fermions , and investigate the effects of the interplay between disorder and interactions in the momentum distribution and noise correlations of those systems .",
    "these two observables can be experimentally probed through time - of - flight measurements @xcite .",
    "noise correlations have been examined before for several hcb systems , including homogeneous , period-2 superlattices , and truly random disordered systems @xcite . however",
    ", previous studies of hcbs in incommensurate superlattices @xcite were limited to small system sizes , which prevented an accurate determination of the scaling of off - diagonal correlations at the superfluid to insulator transition .",
    "the present study is partially motivated by an alternative approach to computing four - point correlations @xcite .",
    "this approach enables the investigation of larger systems and opens the possibility of a detailed scaling analysis and better characterization of the quantum phase transition .",
    "one of our key results here is the determination of the exponents at the transition point .",
    "furthermore , as one approaches the thermodynamic limit , roots of divergent behavior in the derivative of the correlation peak intensities become apparent at the hcb localization - delocalization phase transition . that singularity is absent in the free fermionic system .",
    "this is another important finding in this work .",

    "[ sec : model ] describes the model and defines the correlation functions .",

    "one - dimensional hard - core bosons in incommensurate superlattices , within the one - band approximation , are described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operator at the site @xmath2 , satisfying the bosonic commutation relations @xmath3=\\delta_{ij}$ ] and the on - site constraints @xmath4 ; @xmath5 is the bosonic particle number operator . here",
    "@xmath6 is the hopping energy between adjacent sites , which we set to one @xmath7 in our work , and @xmath8 denotes the external potential on site @xmath2 generated by the secondary lattice .",
    "note that the primary lattice is the only one that is described within the tight binding approximation .",
    "@xmath8 , on the other hand , has the following form : @xmath9 where the parameter @xmath10 is proportional to the intensity of the lasers used to create the secondary lattice , @xmath11 is the ratio between the wave vectors of the two lattices , and @xmath12 is a generic phase factor . here",
    ", we choose @xmath12 to be zero without lost of generality .",
    "finally , we note that periodic boundary conditions are considered throughout this work .",
    "quasiperiodic lattices are characterized by an irrational @xmath11 , which results from the incommensurate periodicity of the two superimposed lattices . in our studies , we choose @xmath11 to be the reverse golden ratio , @xmath13 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that the golden mean is considered to be the most irrational number @xcite and has simple number theoretical properties . in our numerical calculations , @xmath11 is approximated by the ratio of two consecutive fibonacci numbers @xmath14 , where the fibonacci numbers are defined by the recursion relation @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "within the approximation followed in this manuscript , model on a quasiperiodic superlattice reduces to a model on a periodic superlattice whose properties are well known ( @xmath11 is rational ) .",
    "the latter nevertheless captures the localization - delocalization transition exhibited by the quasi - periodic system @xcite .",
    "we focus our analysis on two observables , the momentum distribution function @xmath17 and the noise correlations @xmath18 , defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 denote the momentum values , @xmath21 the number of lattice sites , @xmath22 the lattice constant , @xmath23 the reciprocal lattice vector , and @xmath24 an integer .",
    "the expression for @xmath25 was derived in ref .",
    "the linear term , proportional to @xmath26 , has its roots in the commutation relations of bosonic fields and the requirement of using normal ordered operators if one wants to map time - of - flight observables to _ in - situ _ correlations evaluated before the expansion and restricted to the lowest band .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "an important point to be kept in mind",
    "when evaluating it is that , for hard - core bosons , only normal ordered expectation values can be computed using the mapping to a spin-1/2 chain and then to noninteracting fermions @xcite .",
    "in contrast to earlier studies where correlations were calculated using wick s theorem @xcite , here we follow an alternative procedure based on slater determinants @xcite , which , for completeness , is briefly reviewed in appendix [ app : method ] .      as mentioned before ,",
    "two - color superlattices characterized by an irrational @xmath11 , are intermediate between periodic and fully random , and exhibit a metal - insulator transition in one dimension .",
    "the critical point @xmath27 describes the onset of localization .",
    "below criticality ( @xmath28 ) , single - particle states are extended , namely , they are bloch - like states . above the critical point , single - particle states are exponentially localized with localization length @xmath29 @xcite .        in the extended phase ,",
    "the energy spectrum consists of a set of bands ( it becomes a cantor set at the localization threshold ) .",
    "the gaps are located at @xmath30(mod 1)@xmath31 in the first brillouin zone , indexed by an integer @xmath24 .",
    "note that as @xmath24 increases the width of the gaps narrows . as a consequence of our selection of @xmath32 , the single - particle spectrum consists of @xmath33 bands and @xmath34 gaps .",
    "the filling factor @xmath35 in a many - body system , where @xmath36 is the number of particles and @xmath21 the number of sites , is then a control parameter that tunes transitions between different phases . for fillings",
    "@xmath37(mod 1 ) and @xmath38(mod 1 ) , the ground state of hcbs in the extended regime is a mott insulator .",
    "this insulating state is incompressible and it is also referred to as an incommensurate insulator @xcite .",
    "the fact that the system is insulating at those fillings can be understood because the conduction bands in the fermionic system , to which the hcbs can be mapped , are filled @xcite . for all other fillings , the ground state is superfluid . to be able to observe the fractional mott insulating phases",
    ", the lattice size must be identical to ( or multiple integers of ) the period of the incommensurate potential , which means that we choose @xmath39 while having @xmath32 . in our study",
    ", we consider lattices with @xmath4034,55,89,144 , and 233 . for @xmath41 ,",
    "i.e. , in the localized regime , the ground state remains an incompressible insulator for fillings @xmath37(mod 1 ) and @xmath38(mod 1 ) .",
    "for all other fillings , on the other hand , the ground state is a bose glass .",
    "the bose - glass phase is a compressible insulating state where the absence of transport is the result of localization @xcite .",
    "in this section , we perform a finite size scaling study of the momentum distribution as well as the noise correlations in different regimes . typical momentum profiles and noise correlation patterns",
    "are shown in fig .",

    "the momentum distribution reflects the quantum coherence of the system .",
    "it exhibits a sharp diffraction pattern in the extended regime ( superfluid phase ) and a flat profile in the bose glass and mott insulating phases [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : profile](a ) ] .",
    "the interference pattern is characterized by a peak at @xmath42 and additional sublattice peaks at the corresponding reciprocal lattice vectors . in the quasiperiodic lattice under consideration , they are found at @xmath43(mod 1)@xmath44 and @xmath45(mod 1)@xmath44 . in general , only peaks associated with",
    "the main reciprocal lattice vectors , @xmath46 , are distinguishable .",

    "twiss interferometry .",
    "it exhibits interference peaks in all phases , even in the insulating ones .",
    "in contrast to the momentum distribution , the noise correlation fringes have their root in the quantum statistics of the particles . for bosonic systems ,",
    "the peaks are positive and are a manifestation of bunching . for fermionic systems , they are negative and signal antibunching @xcite .",
    "the height of the noise correlation peaks and their underlying background significantly vary in the various quantum phases studied here .",

    "the distinction in the scaling behavior in the extended regime , at the transition point , and in the localized regime is apparent .",
    "one can see that both @xmath48 and @xmath47 exhibit power - law scaling in the superfluid phase as well as at criticality , while in the bose - glass phase they remain essentially unchanged with changing @xmath21 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sizescal1](a ) , the four sets of values of @xmath48 vs @xmath21 for @xmath520.5,0.6,0.8 , and 0.9 exhibit exponents @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , respectively , which are compatible with the well - known @xmath57 scaling for hcbs in the superfluid regime , where the quasi - long - range order is present in the one - particle correlations . in fig .  [ fig : sizescal1](b ) , the exponents for @xmath47 in the extended regime are @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , also for @xmath520.5 , 0.6 , 0.8 , and 0.9 , respectively .",
    "these results are compatible with the linear behavior @xmath62 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the superfluid phase of the homogeneous system and the period-2 lattice was studied .",

    "fig : sizescal1 ] shows that both @xmath48 and @xmath47 do not scale with system size , which is a demonstration of the presence of exponentially decaying correlations in the bose - glass phase , and hence the lack of luttinger liquid behavior .",
    "the behavior at the critical point is the most interesting one , as the system is not expected to be described by the luttinger liquid theory .",

    "this finding is surprising for @xmath74 because , as follows from the scaling of the @xmath47 peak , quasi - long - range order is present in the system in that regime . on the other hand ,",
    "the absence of those peaks is expected in the glassy phase where correlations decay exponentially .",
