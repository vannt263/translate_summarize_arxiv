    "the radiation from the compact radio source in the galactic center , sgr a * , has been clearly determined to be nonthermal in nature .",
    "vlbi observations have found the source to have a brightness temperature in excess of @xmath6 k and a size less than 1 au ( rogers _ et al .",
    "the compact source has been interpreted as a black hole undergoing accretion at a very low rate ( @xmath7 to @xmath8 ) , either through advection dominated accretion ( narayan , yi & mahadevan 1994 ) or through spherical accretion which may include a disk at small radii ( melia 1994 ) . in both models",
    "the accreting material is mass lost from nearby massive stars through winds .",
    "the radio emission may originate in an infalling spheroid , a disk or a low - power blandford - knigl jet ( falcke , mannheim & biermann 1993 ) .",
    "these theories are constrained by the broadband spectrum and the compact size of the radio source .",
    "recent dynamical evidence supports the black hole hypothesis .",
    "the proper motions of early type stars within 0.01 pc of sgr a * are greater than 1000 km s@xmath9 ( genzel _ et al .",
    "the velocity dispersion as a function of radius suggests a contained mass of @xmath10 .",
    "further , if the kinetic energies of these stars are in equipartition with that of sgr a * , then we find that the proper motion of sgr a * ( backer 1996 ) implies a minimum mass of @xmath11 .",
    "if this mass is confined within 1 au as the vlbi results imply , then a mass density of @xmath12 is required .",
    "considerations of the short time scales of stability of a cluster of dark objects with this density lead to the strong conclusion that sgr a * indeed harbors a massive black hole ( maoz 1997 ) .",
    "due to diffractive scattering by electrons in the turbulent interstellar medium near the galactic center , the angular size of sgr a * is broadened ( e.g. , yusef - zadeh _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "the source is elliptical at a position angle of approximately @xmath13 with an axial ratio near 0.5 .",
    "the major axis has a @xmath14 dependence that extends from 20 to 0.3 cm .",
    "the scattering hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a similar angular broadening and asymmetry in the images of oh masers within 15 arcmin of sgr a * ( van langevelde & diamond 1991 ) .",
    "since the effect of scattering decreases more rapidly with wavelength than angular resolution , at a short enough wavelength the compact source should appear unobscured .",
    "currently vlbi observations at millimeter wavelengths stand in conflict . at 3 mm @xmath0 rogers _ et al .  _",
    "( 1994 ) found an upper limit to the apparent size of 0.2 mas , in agreement with an extrapolation of the scattering law .",
    "observing at 7 mm @xmath0 in august 1992 , backer _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1993 ) found with 5 stations of the national radio astronomy observatory very long baseline array ( vlba ) an apparent size of 0.7 mas , also in agreement with the scattering law .",
    "however , krichbaum _ et al .  _",
    "( 1993 ) , observing with an array of 4 vlba stations at 7 mm @xmath0 in may 1992 , found a size @xmath15 mas at a position angle of @xmath16 .",
    "they also consider a two component model in which the brighter component has a size of @xmath17 mas and the fainter component is at a position angle of @xmath18 .",
    "in this paper we present 7 mm @xmath0 observations of sgr a * using the full vlba .",
    "the additional baselines in these observations significantly improve the density and extent of @xmath19 coverage over the previous experiments .",
    "we present a map as well as a study of the visibility data .",
    "the vlba observed sgr",
    "a * on 1994 september 29 at 43 ghz with a bandwidth of 64 mhz .",
    "the data were correlated in socorro , new mexico .",
    "the compact blazar nrao  530 was used as an amplitude calibrator and fringe detection source .",
    "high snr detections of nrao  530 were made on all baselines .",
    "initial reduction of the data was performed with the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . _",
    "a priori _ amplitude calibration was performed first .",
    "we determined that the zenith atmospheric optical depth ranged from 0.05 at mauna kea to 0.18 at hancock .",
    "singleband delays were determined with fringe fitting to a short segment of nrao  530 data and then applied to the sgr a * visibilities .",
    "multiband delays and rates were found by fringe fitting directly to the sgr a * visibilities .",
    "the snr of detections and the consistency of fringe rate and multiband delay solutions indicate that detections were made to all stations except mauna kea , saint croix and hancock .",
    "no detection of sgr a * was made at a @xmath19 distance greater than 250 @xmath20 .",
    "data were averaged to 64 seconds after fringe detection .",
    "we improved the amplitude calibration of sgr a * through mapping of nrao  530 .",
    "a single gaussian with a size of 0.102 by 0.056 mas fits the nrao  530 visibilities very well .",
    "station gains deviated from unity by 20% or less .",
    "these station gains were applied to the visibility data of sgr a * and used for imaging and visibility analysis .",
    "this calibration significantly reduced the scatter in the sgr a * visibility amplitudes .",
    "we self - calibrated the visibility phase of sgr a * with iterative mapping .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : sgra ] an image of sgr a * made with a robustness parameter of 2 ( briggs 1995 ) .",
    "the corresponding beam fwhm is @xmath21 mas at a position angle of @xmath22 .",
    "we show the same image with the clean components convolved with a circular beam with fwhm of 0.400 mas in figure  [ fig : sgrasup ] .",
    "we fit gaussian models directly to the calibrated visibility data with a non - linear least - squares method .",
    "we only used visibility data on baselines shorter than 200 @xmath20 .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : sgrauvd ] the visibility amplitudes as a function of @xmath19 distance along with circular gaussian models .",
    "a noise bias of 0.140 jy was added in quadrature to the model .",
    "the best circular gaussian fit has a fwhm of @xmath23 mas .",
    "an elliptical gaussian fit gives a fwhm of @xmath24 mas in a position angle of @xmath4 .",
    "we find an axial ratio of @xmath3 .",
    "we find consistent results fitting gaussians to the two images .",
    "the absence of a detection on the hancock - saint croix baseline provides an opportunity to place an upper limit on the axial ratio .",
    "this baseline has moderate north - south resolution with @xmath25 at the beginning of the track .",
    "the average amplitude on this baseline coherently integrated over the fringe detection time scale is @xmath26 mjy .",
    "we find the axial ratio @xmath27 .",
    "the total flux determined from the fit to the visibility data is @xmath28 jy .",
    "the quoted error does not include systematic calibration errors , which may be as high as 20% .      in order to search",
    "further for non - elliptically symmetric structure in sgr a * , we analyzed the closure phases in detail .",
    "we extracted the visibility data from aips and formed the closure phase in 2 second intervals .",
    "we vector averaged this complex phasor for 10 minute segments .",
    "errors were determined from the distribution of the closure phases ( thompson , moran & swenson 1991 , section 9.3 ) . for a weak signal ,",
    "the distribution is linear in the cosine of the phase and the phase error goes as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the bispectrum amplitude and @xmath31 is the noise amplitude . for a strong signal ,",
    "the distribution is gaussian and we find @xmath32    we computed the @xmath33 statistic for the krichbaum _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1993 ) two component model ( their model b ) and for a symmetric model .",
    "we find @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 degrees of freedom , which clearly eliminates the krichbaum _",
    "et al .  _ model at the epoch of these observations .",
    "we show some of the closure phases along with the krichbaum _",
    "_ model in figure  [ fig : sgracp1 ] .",
    "the closure phase plots reveal that the phase does not deviate significantly from zero where the krichbaum _ et al .",
    "_ model predicts substantial variation .",
    "these deviations are apparent on both the close inner triangles and on the more spread out triangles which include br , fd and ov , stations not used in the krichbaum _",
    "_ experiment .",
    "is there any evidence for asymmetry aside from that in the krichbaum _",
    "the reduced @xmath33 value for the symmetric hypothesis is 1.17 which leaves little phase space for a secondary component .",
    "the images and the visibility data do not reveal any evidence for asymmetric structure at the level of the beam sidelobes , 35 mjy .",
    "the diffuse components in figures  [ fig : sgra ] and [ fig : sgrasup ] coincide with beam sidelobes and are , therefore , unlikely to be real .",
    "imaging with the full vlba at 7 mm @xmath0 shows that the size and shape of sgr a * is fully consistent with the predictions of the scattering law derived at lower frequencies .",
    "we find a major axis fwhm of @xmath1 mas .",
    "the scattering model predicts @xmath2 mas .",
    "we also find an axial ratio and a position angle consistent with that previously identified at longer wavelengths and with the backer _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1993 ) results at 7 mm .",
    "we find no evidence for structure that is not elliptically symmetric to a limit of 35 mjy .",
    "we can not rule out the existence of a second component in the past : a synchrotron component at the epoch of the krichbaum _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1993 ) observations is likely to have decayed significantly by the epoch of our observations .",
    "if the intrinsic size adds in quadrature with the scattering size to form the apparent size , the major and minor axes of the intrinsic source must be less than 0.48 mas . for a galactocentric distance of 8.5 kpc",
    ", this corresponds to 4.1 au .",
    "we infer a lower limit to the brightness temperature of @xmath37 k. this limit is less than the limit of @xmath6 k found by backer _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1993 ) at 7 mm @xmath0 and rogers _ et al .  _",
    "( 1994 ) at 3 mm @xmath0 principally due to the lower flux in our epoch of observation .",
    "the morphology and size of sgr a * did not change from the backer _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1993 ) observations despite a factor of two decrease in the flux .",
    "the upper limit to source expansion over this epoch is @xmath38 .",
    "the constant size also supports the hypothesis that the apparent source is scattered radiation from the intrinsic source .",
    "an unobscured , homogeneous synchrotron source with constant magnetic field , spectral index and peak frequency would show a 40% increase in its angular size with a doubling in flux density ( marscher 1983 ) .",
    "only a conspiracy of parameter changes could keep the size from changing significantly .",
    "the constant ellipticity as a function of wavelength indicates a coherent magnetic field over 0.02 to @xmath39 pc for a scattering screen near the galactic center .",
    "detection of a change in the ellipticity with wavelength would be indicative of a turbulent magnetic field on these scales ( e.g. , wilkinson , narayan & spencer 1994 ) . at 7",
    "mm @xmath0 the refractive time scale is on the order of 2 years .",
    "hence , future observers might expect to see a change in the ellipticity of sgr a*.    these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the radio emission from sgr a * results from synchrotron or cyclo - synchrotron radiation of gas in the vicinity of a black hole .",
    "both radial and rotating flow models predict the mass of the black hole on the order of @xmath5 and the accretion rate in the range @xmath40 to @xmath8 ( melia 1994 , narayan _ et al .",
    "the radio emission may originate in a spherical cloud or in a low - power inhomogeneous jet .",
    "however , the absence of any external feature at any wavelength argues against the jet model .",
    "what will shorter wavelength vlbi observations reveal in sgr a * ?",
    "future global vlbi arrays at 1.3 mm @xmath0 will have an angular resolution of 20 @xmath41as ( wright & bower 1997 ) , which is on the scale of a few schwarzschild radii for a @xmath5 black hole . at this wavelength scattering",
    "will not dominate since the expected scattering size is 27 @xmath41as .",
    "however , recent measurements of the centimeter to submillimeter spectrum indicate the presence of two compact sources on two different size scales ( serabyn _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , falcke _ et al .",
    "if the intrinsic source responsible for the centimeter to millimeter wavelength spectrum has a spectral turnover near 3 mm @xmath0 , then this component may be forever invisible to vlbi .",
