    "the advent of modern gamma - ray burst ( grb ) astronomy occurred in 1997 with the dramatic discovery by the _ beppo - sax _ satellite of the first grb afterglow @xcite .",
    "this led to the identification of grb host galaxies , the determination of their redshifts ( and hence , their distances ) , and the measurement of important physical properties such as total energy .",
    "these observations provided strong evidence supporting the fireball model ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , which attributes the burst itself and the subsequent afterglow to shocks generated by a highly relativistic fireball ejected from the grb progenitor .",
    "the typical _ beppo - sax _ afterglow observation began 6 - 8 hours after the burst @xcite , and therefore early x - ray afterglows were only observed for a handful of cases before 2004 .",
    "@xcite reported _ beppo - sax _ light curves for two extremely bright bursts ( grb011121 and grb011211 ) in which the early afterglow was captured by the wide field camera before the satellite was re - pointed .",
    "both of these early afterglows contained bright x - ray flares several hundred seconds after the burst , in which the flux increased rapidly by a factor of several ( e.g. , the flare peaking at @xmath1s in figure  [ fig : piro ] ) .",
    "these events were attributed to the onset of the external shock in the circumburst medium .",
    "such observations were quite rare until recently .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite @xcite was specifically designed to study early grb afterglows by automatically and immediately slewing to grbs discovered on - board .",
    "the satellite carries three instruments : the wide - field burst alert telescope ( bat : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which detects bursts and provides a coarse position on the sky ( typically @xmath2 arcminutes ) ; and two narrow - field instruments : the x - ray telescope ( xrt : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the uv / optical telescope ( uvot : * ? ? ?",
    "prompt slews are successfully executed for @xmath3 of bursts detected by the bat , and the afterglows are observed intensively by the xrt and uvot for hours , days or weeks , depending on the burst .",
    "the xrt is designed to switch automatically between different readout modes in order to optimize the science as the afterglow fades @xcite .",
    "swift _ is in a low earth orbit ( 95 minute orbital period ) , there are gaps in the light curves when the satellite is on the wrong side of the earth to view the burst .    in virtually every case ,",
    "the xrt detects a fading x - ray afterglow of the burst .",
    "the resulting data set has provided the first comprehensive study of the early x - ray afterglows of grbs in the time interval of @xmath4 to @xmath5ks post - burst .",
    "we have found that the typical x - ray afterglow light curve follows a canonical template @xcite , well illustrated by the case of grb060428a ( figure  [ fig:060428a ] ) .",
    "this canonical light curve is a broken power law ( @xmath6^{-\\alpha_x}$ ] , where t0 is the time at which the burst was detected ) with flares superimposed .",
    "the first phase consists of a rapid decline in brightness from the burst itself ( with @xmath7 in this case ) , which is attributed to light delay effects from the expanding shock @xcite .",
    "this is followed by a flat plateau phase ( in this case , the plateau phase has two parts , with @xmath8 and 0.7 ) , probably produced by energy injection into the external shock ; a ` normal ' afterglow with @xmath9 , and sometimes a late break to @xmath10 when the edge of the collimated jet becomes visible .",
    "detailed discussions of the physics behind these phases can be found in @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "although very few afterglows exhibit all of these phases , most afterglows can be characterized as a combination of at least two of them .",
    "roughly half of the afterglows have x - ray flares superimposed on this broken power - law light curve .",
    "the flare in grb060428a is fairly weak , peaking only @xmath11% in excess of the underlying power law level , but is otherwise typical of the flares observed with the xrt .",
    "we note that in this case , the flaring occurs during the plateau phase of the afterglow , that the afterglow from the external forward shock is already in progress when the flare begins , and that the light curve returns to this afterglow decay following the flare .",
    "several examples of these flares have been discussed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . here",
    "we provide a more comprehensive look at the properties of these x - ray flares and what they can tell us about the grb itself .",
    "by way of contrast with the tiny flare of grb060428a , we next consider the giant flares seen in grb050502b and grb060526 ( figure  [ fig : giant_flares ] ) .",
    "grb050502b is discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the afterglow was initially faint , but the flux increased dramatically by a factor of @xmath12 , beginning about 345s after the burst and peaking at about 700s .",
    "the total x - ray fluence of the flare , @xmath13erg@xmath14 in the 0.2 - 10kev band , is comparable to the 15 - 350kev fluence of the gamma - ray burst itself . like grb060428a",
    ", the flare appears to be superimposed on a power law decay that continues at the same slope after the flare ends ; we will refer to this as the ` underlying afterglow ' in subsequent discussion .",
    "the underlying afterglow in the case of grb050502b has a decay slope of @xmath15 .",
    "the afterglow begins before the commencement of xrt observations ( and before the flare begins ) and continues after the flare ends .",
    "the giant flare in grb060526 is remarkably similar , with a flux increase of about @xmath16 relative to the underlying afterglow , which also has @xmath15 . in this case , the giant flare clearly consists of two separate , overlapping flares , peaking at about 220s and 300s . the level of the underlying afterglow before the flares is less clear than in grb050502b .",
    "giant flares like these so dominate the light curve that they are reminiscent of the gamma - ray burst itself , although at lower energies and much longer time - scales .",
    "we will see that these two differences ( energy range and time - scale ) may be related .",
    "figure  [ fig:050421 ] shows the x - ray light curve of grb050421 @xcite .",
    "this light curve has a single power - law decay ( @xmath17 ) with at least two flares superimposed , including the large ( but poorly - sampled ) flare at t0 + 110s .",
    "there is no hint in this light curve of any flattening due to the presence of an afterglow from the forward shock ; in fact , there is no evidence for any interaction of the shock with the external medium .",
    "this grb is therefore considered to be a possible ` naked ' grb , i.e. , a grb located in an extremely low density region @xcite .",
    "the absence of measured forward shock emission ( to levels orders of magnitude below typical afterglow fluxes ) , combined with the presence of multiple flares in the light curve , therefore provides strong evidence that these flares originate elsewhere , perhaps in internal shocks within the relativistic outflow .",
    "x - ray flares or bumps have been observed in all phases of the x - ray light curves , though they occur primarily in the first hour after the burst .",
    "for example , the flares in grb060607a occur during the initial steep decay , whilst those in grb050502b and grb060526 ( figure  [ fig : giant_flares ] ) , as well as grb060428a ( figure  [ fig:060428a ] ) , occur during the flat plateau . in a few cases",
    "we find a strong , rapidly rising and decaying flare at quite late times , such as the giant flare of grb050916 ( figure  [ fig:050916 ] ) .",
    "this is clearly similar to the early strong flares seen in other bursts .",
    "grb050730 ( figure  [ fig : multiple_flares ] ) has a light curve that continues to flare at times as late as 35ks post - burst .",
    "we attribute this variability to flaring , even though distinct flares are not visible in this case , because it is not possible to fit any simple series of power laws to this light curve .",
    "we note that a power law decay slope is established between 4.5ks and 7ks post - burst , and the light curve drops back to an extrapolation of this decay slope in the interval around 25ks , consistent with intervening flares on top of an underlying afterglow .",
    "by contrast , other mechanisms for increased count rates , such as refreshed shocks , add energy into the external shock and thereafter the decay continues at a higher level instead of dropping back to the original curve .",
    "in addition to isolated single flares , xrt light curves have many examples of multiple flares , such as those shown in figure  [ fig : multiple_flares ] .",
    "the light curves of grb050730 and grb060111a both begin with at least three x - ray flares of roughly equal peak flux ( or count rate ) .",
    "this argues against single - shot flare mechanisms , such as the onset of the afterglow .",
    "* cite other evidence suggesting that the onset of the afterglow occurs very early in the light curve , probably prior to the rapid decline phase at the end of the last gamma - ray pulse . )",
    "figure  [ fig:060306 ] shows the bat and xrt light curves for grb060306 .    in this burst , the bat detected three distinct peaks of activity , with the last occurring at about t0 + 44s . by the time the xrt began observations at t0 + 100s",
    "the prompt activity had ended , and the xrt observations begin with the steep decay of the tail of the prompt emission .    had the xrt observations of grb060306 started before t0 + 40s , both xrt and bat would have observed the third peak of the prompt emission .",
    "in fact , this has happened for a number of long - lasting bursts , including grb050117 @xcite , grb050713a @xcite , grb050820a @xcite , grb060124 @xcite , grb060418 , grb060510b , grb060607a , and grb060714 . in figure",
    "[ fig : bat_xrt ] we show a recent example .    the bat and xrt observed this burst in the 15 - 150kev and 0.2 - 10kev bands , respectively .",
    "spectral evolution is evident in the different relative strengths and widths of the peaks as detected by the two instruments .",
    "in general , the soft x - ray manifestations of the prompt peaks are significantly broader than the peaks observed in the hard x - ray band , as is clear from the light curves of grb060607a , in which it is also clear that the soft x - ray peak is very similar to the later x - ray flares .",
    "the energy dependence of the prompt peaks is particularly evident in grb060124 @xcite , which was detected by both _ swift _ and konus - wind and so has very broad - band coverage .",
    "figure  [ fig:060124 ] shows the main burst of grb060124 as a function of energy from the optical ( v band ) to @xmath18-ray ( 1mev ) .",
    "this burst had a particularly long period of activity , with a precursor that triggered the bat nearly 10 minutes before the main burst .",
    "this later pulse is very narrow at high energies , but is quite broad in the soft x - ray band , and is followed by a very similar , but much softer x - ray flare that is barely detected by the bat above 15kev .",
    "the only distinction between this later x - ray flare and the earlier gamma - ray burst appears to be the spectral distribution of the photons .",
    "we note that this event would have been classified as an x - ray flash ( xrf ) had it consisted only of this later flare .",
    "these giant flares are so bright that detailed spectral analysis is possible .",
    "detailed spectral analysis for grb050502b is discussed in @xcite , who also showed that a simple hardness ratio shows strong spectral evolution , increasing steeply at the beginning of the flare , peaking well before the flare itself peaks , and then dropping gradually through the remainder of the flare , finally returning to the same level established in the afterglow emission before the flare .",
    "this behaviour is also seen in other bursts with sufficient statistics : e.g. , grbs050607 @xcite , 050822 @xcite , 051117a , and 060607a @xcite .",
    "this spectral evolution results from a hard - to - soft transition in the x - ray flare similar to that commonly seen in grb prompt emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a particularly interesting example is grb060714 , in which a series of pulses in the bat energy range ( 15 - 350kev ) is followed by a similar series in the xrt band ( 0.2 - 10kev ) .",
    "the spectra of these pulses can be fit with a cut - off power law model , giving clear evidence of spectral evolution ( figure  [ fig:060714 ] ) ,    with the spectrum becoming successively softer with each new peak .",
    "similar behavior is observed in a number of other flares , and includes apparent transitions of the emission from the gamma - ray or hard x - ray bands into the soft x - ray band as time progresses .",
    "for example , observationally we see in both grb060714 and grb060418 that the final , weak bat pulse is seen in the xrt as a strong flare .",
    "this transition to softer pulses can be clearly seen in grb060124 ( figure  [ fig:060124 ] ) . as a final example",
    ", our analysis of grb050416a finds evidence that @xmath19 moves from the bat band into the xrt band @xcite .",
    "this suggests a strong connection between the x - ray flares and the prompt emission - they appear to be the same phenomenon , simply expressed at lower energies at later times .",
    "so far we have only discussed flares in long grbs , which are thought to be the result of the collapse of massive stars into black holes .",
    "two short grbs , grb050724 @xcite and grb051210 @xcite , also have flares in their x - ray light curves .",
    "this requires that short grb models , which typically invoke mergers of compact objects ( two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole ) , must also be capable of producing flares . of particular interest in this regard",
    "is the very late and energetic event at about 12 hours post - burst in grb050724 , a very late time - scale for a merger process thought to last only milliseconds .",
    "having examined some ` case studies ' illustrative of the properties of the x - ray flares , we now turn to a more objective statistical treatment of their properties .",
    "we are undertaking a comprehensive study of the properties of flares using a set of 77 flares in 33 xrt afterglows . here",
    "we simply highlight a few preliminary results related to the temporal properties of x - ray flares in grb afterglows .    the distribution of peak times of flares is shown in figure  [ fig : tpeak ] .",
    "the times are in the observer frame , uncorrected for redshift ( since we do not have redshifts for many of these bursts ) .",
    "the distribution follows a power law with slope of -1.1 , with flares strongly concentrated at early times .",
    "this is not surprising if the x - ray flares represent the last sputters of the grb , but further work must be done to determine whether this distribution can be used to rule out other models for the flares .",
    "an important clue to the nature of the flares can be found by analysing their rise and decay times .",
    "mechanisms such as external shocks encountering clouds in the circumburst medium are expected to produce rather slow rise and decay times , with decay times characterized by @xmath20 @xcite . by contrast , the pulses associated with collisions of shocks within the relativistic outflow ( ` internal shocks ' ) are typically much faster , with @xmath21 .",
    "the x - ray flares span both ranges , with some having @xmath22 or less .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig:050916 ] shows a case of a narrow , late flare .    in order to ascertain the rise and decay times",
    ", we have fit each flare in our sample of 77 flares with a model consisting of an underlying power law decay with a flare superimposed on it .",
    "we fit both the rising portion of the flare and its decay with power laws .",
    "we then define @xmath23 as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the peak time ( the time when the rising power law intersects the decaying power law ) , and @xmath26 is the time when the rising power law intersects the underlying afterglow s power law decay .",
    "similarly , the decay time is defined as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the time when the falling power law tail of the flare crosses the underlying power law decay .",
    "figure  [ fig : dt ] shows the distributions of rise and decay times for our sample .",
    "the distributions peak near @xmath29 , uncomfortably short for external shocks .",
    "x - ray flares in grb afterglows could be produced by a variety of mechanisms , including internal shocks ( the same mechanism that produces the grb prompt emission ) at late times , external forward shocks ( either the onset of the forward shock or encounters by the forward shock of density gradients or clouds ) , or external reverse shocks . based on the observations described above , we believe that there is strong evidence that x - ray flares in early grb afterglows are not produced by the external shock ( forward or reverse ) . this view is supported by : 1 ) the rapid rise and decay times of most x - ray flares ; 2 ) the multiplicity of many x - ray flares , which can not be explained by ` single - shot ' mechanisms like the onset of the afterglow ; 3 ) the fact that some flares are clearly superimposed on a pre - existing afterglow decay ; 4 ) the observation of flares in ` naked ' afterglows with no evidence for forward shock emission ( e.g. , grb050421 ) ; 5 ) the enormous increase in flux in giant flares .    by contrast , all of these characteristics are easily accommodated by internal shocks .",
    "internal shocks can also explain the following observational characteristics of x - ray flares : 1 ) the similarity between the shapes of x - ray flares and x - ray peaks in the prompt emission ; 2 ) the spectral evolution of x - ray flares , both within individual flares and between successive flares , which mimics that commonly seen in the prompt emission .",
    "additional support for the view that x - ray flares are due to internal shocks comes from the analysis of @xcite , who showed that the decay slopes of x - ray flares are consistent with the expectations of the ` curvature effect ' ( time delay effects from an extended shock front following the cessation of the emission ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we conclude that x - ray flares in grb afterglows are probably the result of late - time internal shocks .",
    "these late internal shocks can be produced in at least two ways . in the internal shock model @xcite , the central engine activity produces a series of shells of outflowing material with a variety of lorentz factors , and",
    "the grb prompt emission results from ` internal shocks ' as these shells collide in the relativistic outflow .",
    "such collisions can occur over a wide range of timescales , with late shocks resulting from collisions between shells with lorentz factors that differ by only a small amount .",
    "these could produce x - ray flares at relatively late times .",
    "the fact that these late - time collisions must occur at large radii may lead to a natural explanation for the relatively soft photon emission . on the other hand",
    ", this mechanism may not be able to produce the required efficiency of conversion of kinetic energy of the jet to afterglow flux , due to the weakness of the resulting shock @xcite .",
    "a second possibility is that the late internal shocks are the result of continued activity in the central engine itself . in this case",
    ", the central engine must remain active for time - scales up to ten times longer than the prompt emission , with important implications for grb models . for long grbs ,",
    "the leading collapsar model would need to explain in - fall of material into the central black hole over time - scales of hours . for short grbs , a similar problem exists in the context of merging compact objects .",
    "we note that the redshift of the grb can play a role in delaying flaring activity in the observer s frame , and also in broadening the flares",
    ". this can not be the sole explanation for late , broad x - ray flares , however ; even in the case of grb050904 , with redshift @xmath30 , flaring occurs for over an hour in the burst rest frame @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mean redshift of flaring grbs ( @xmath31 for 14 flaring grbs with known redshifts ) does not differ significantly from those without flares , so the x - ray flares are not simply due to prompt emission delayed , broadened , and reduced in peak energy by high redshifts .",
    "we conclude that the central engines of grbs remain active for hours following the grb event .",
