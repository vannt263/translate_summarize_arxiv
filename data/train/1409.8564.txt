    "predictive calculations of spin - spin relaxation in solid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) is a long - standing and still not fully solved problem@xcite .",
    "similar problems also occur in the context of decoherence of solid - state qubits caused by nuclear spins@xcite . due to the smallness of nuclear gyromagnetic ratios ,",
    "the limit of practical interest here is that of infinite temperature . at infinite temperature ,",
    "the static equilibrium properties are trivial , but the dynamic ones are not .",
    "direct numerical calculations of spin - spin relaxation are often not feasible , because the memory required grows exponentially with the number of spins in the system . in such a situation , simulations of classical spin lattices become an important computational resource .",
    "it is common knowledge in the field of nmr that the dynamics of classical spins often well represents the behavior of systems of small quantum spins including even spins 1/2 .",
    "this issue was investigated over the years by a number of authors@xcite .",
    "however , the limits of the accuracy of classical simulations for the description of quantum spin relaxation at high temperatures have not yet been established .",
    "the goal of the present article is to investigate these limits as far as the the range of interaction , the size of individual quantum spins and the long - time behavior of spin - spin relaxation is concerned .",
    "this work was in part motivated by the previous investigations of one of us@xcite that have shown that free induction decays ( fids ) in both classical and quantum spin systems exhibit generic exponential long - time decay on the time scale of microscopic spin - spin interaction .",
    "theoretical analysis@xcite , numerical simulations@xcite and experiments@xcite also indicate that , normally , the above long - time behavior becomes dominant after time of the order of characteristic spin - spin interaction time , i.e. rather fast .",
    "therefore , we expected that , if the interaction constants for classical spin simulations are chosen such that the initial evolutions of the quantum and classical fids are matched , then the agreement between the two fids may last until the onset of the exponential long - time behavior , and , if so , the two fids will not diverge much afterwards .",
    "this expectation is largely confirmed by the results presented below even for the lattices of spins 1/2 with relatively few interacting neighbours .",
    "the plan of the rest of the article is the following : section  [ general ] contains the formulation of the problem . in section",
    "[ experiment ] , we compare classical spin calculations with the experimental nmr results for caf@xmath0 . in section  [ model ] , we compare classical and quantum calculations for model spin systems . finally , section  [ discussion ] contains a concluding discussion , which , in particular , includes semi - empirical criteria identifying quantum spin systems for which classical simulations are expected to produce quantitatively accurate fids .",
    "we consider translationally invariant spin lattices governed by the hamiltonian : @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents either the quantum operator of the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) projection of a quantum spin on @xmath7 lattice site or the corresponding projection of a vector of length 1 representing a classical spin , @xmath8 are the coupling constants for the @xmath3 projections of the @xmath9th and the @xmath10th spins .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the quantity of interest for this study is an infinite temperature correlation function of the type that characterizes nmr free induction decay@xcite , namely : @xmath11 where the @xmath12 is the total @xmath4-polarization of the system , and notation @xmath13 implies averaging over the infinite temperature equilibrium fluctuations .",

    "the method is explained and rigorously justified in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of quantum typicality .    in the classical case , the rhs of eq.([ct - class ] )",

    "the initial orientations of spins are chosen randomly .",
    "the simulations are based on a 4th - order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "additional averaging is also performed over many different realizations of random initial conditions .",
    "the characteristic time scale of spin dynamics in both classical and quantum case can be characterized by the inverse root - mean - squared value of the local fields @xmath21 : @xmath22 whenever we compare quantum and classical lattices , the interaction constants of the classical hamiltonian are equal to the interaction constants of the quantum hamiltonian multiplied by factor @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the value of individual quantum spins involved .",
    "such a rescaling implies that the characteristic times @xmath25 are the same in both cases .",
    "it also guarantees that the second moments and hence the initial evolutions of the quantum and classical correlation functions are the same .",
    "as far as the long - time behaviour of @xmath14 is concerned , the previous investigations @xcite have shown that , in both classical and quantum systems , it has generic form @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are some constants , typically , of the order of @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is an oscillation phase .",

    "the latter discrepancy is consistent with larger differences of analytically computed moments for quantum and classical fids@xcite .",
    "it is also a likely consequence of the fact that the truncated hamiltonian for @xmath35 along the [ 100 ] direction is such that each spin has only two strongest neighbors , while , for the four second - ranked neighbors , the coupling is two times smaller , i.e. the two strongest neighbors stand apart as far as the dynamic correlations are concerned . for comparison , the truncated hamiltonian for @xmath35 along the [ 111 ] direction also implies that each spin has two strongest neighbors , but then it has twelve second - ranked neighbors with coupling only eight percent smaller .",

    "the exponential sensitivity emerges with the increase of the values of quantum spins@xcite .",
    "it , therefore , appears that the unifying aspect of classical and quantum chaos that leads to the quantitative agreement between classical and quantum relaxation described in the present article is the ergodicity of the underlying dynamics rather than the exponential sensitivity of the system to small perturbations .",
    "ergodicity is compatible with both exponential and power - law sensitivities to small perturbations .    in this article",
