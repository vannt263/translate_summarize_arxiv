    "during the last years there is a huge effort to understand the kinetics of non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "a wide range of discrete and continuous models for such processes is analytically and numerically studied .",
    "the problems of interest in this context concern the crystal growth , transport ( traffic ) models , diffusion processes and supercooled liquids @xcite .    here",
    ", we will apply the kinetics of the fredrickson - andersen model ( fam ) recently discussed in the framework of the glass transition and related phenomena @xcite .",
    "but we show that this model may be used on other fields like stock trading , citation networks , company relations or internet communications as well @xcite . in general , we study the diffusion of information within a network system of active links and passive / active cells ( or nodes ) .",
    "the switch between a passive and active cell is controlled by a temperature - like parameter @xmath1which can be interpreted as the interconnectivity . at the maximum interconnectivity ( at infinite temperature )",
    "the system possesses equal parts of active and passive cells ( nodes ) whereas at the minimum interconnectivity ( at zero temperature ) there are only passive cells ( nodes ) .",
    "furthermore , the alteration is also controlled by the nearest neighborhood .",
    "if enough adjacent active cells ( nodes ) exist ( more than a fixed number @xmath0 ) the active cell ( node ) can become passive and vice versa . thus , only a sufficiently active environment may determine and alter the state of a cell ( node ) like in a citation community where only accepted ( active ) people may decide about the worth of an opinion of a member in a related field . to this network formed by passive / active cells ( nodes )  and active links , consisting of two adjacent active cells ( nodes ) , we add further particles which may be assigned to ( information ) packages .",
    "these particles can only diffuse along active links but are confined by passive cells ( nodes ) .",
    "therefore , we have a diffusion in a self - organized network where information may stick ( and therefore be localized ) at passive cells ( nodes ) or runs through a network of active links .",
    "this is the same situation like in the internet where passive routers can not transfer any data but data on active router should be directed to the next active router ( of course , the difference is that this is a directed motion whereas we consider a non - directed motion here . ) .",
    "now we demonstrate how one may relate this network to the fam originally dedicated to supercooled liquids . for such systems",
    "one assumes that the dynamics can be roughly regarded as independent of the microscopic details , thus the analysis is based on a mesoscopic formulation .",
    "hence , one reduces the degrees of freedom to a smaller set of relevant observables following the original idea of fredrickson and andersen @xcite .",
    "the supercooled liquid as the many - body system is treated on a virtual lattice with sufficiently small cells of size @xmath2 where the lattice should not have any significant influence on the underlying dynamics .",
    "however , in case of our network model we will immediately start on the mesoscopic scale ( e.g. on the elementary scale of routers where the macroscopic scale is the total internet ) .",
    "the cell structure enables us to attach to each cell @xmath3 a two - state observable @xmath4 which characterizes its actual state .",
    "the realization is given by the local activity @xmath5 with @xmath6 ( spin down ) if @xmath7 ( passive state ) and @xmath8 ( spin up ) if @xmath9 ( active state ) where @xmath10 is a fixed threshold of the system .",
    "the threshold is chosen in this way that all cells are passive at zero temperature .",
    "active ( passive ) states may be also denoted as mobile ( immobile ) states . the number of cells in the active and the passive state , respectively , have not to be conserved .",
    "( notice that in case of supercooled liquids the usual separation is done by two different density states although this is more connected to a kawasaki exchange dynamics rather than to a glauber flip dynamics@xcite .",
    "this mapping implies different densities of such cells ; @xmath6 corresponds to the more solid - like state and @xmath11 corresponds to the more liquid - like state . )",
    "thus , the real kinetics is more glauber - like ( non - conserved ) dynamics thus we suppose that the basic dynamics is a flip process @xmath12 .",
    "it is controlled by self - induced topological restrictions introduced below .",
    "this type of dynamics leads to a relaxation behavior resembled to that of a cooperative system .",
    "in particular , an elementary switch at a given cell is allowed only if the number of nearest neighbor mobile / active cells ( @xmath8 ) is equal to or larger than a certain restrictive number @xmath0 with @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the coordination number of the lattice ) .",
    "hence , elementary flip processes combined with the restrictions may lead to the cooperative arrangements within the underlying network system .    as demonstrated",
    "such a mesoscopic approach is able to model supercooled liquids as well .",
    "the fredrickson - andersen model ( or @xmath0spin facilitated kinetic ising model ) @xcite was analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite studied in broad variety .",
    "the fam can be classified as an ising - like model of which kinetics is confined by restrictions of the ordering of nearest neighbors to a given lattice cell . these self  adapting environments especially influence the long - time behavior of the spin - relaxation@xcite particularly relevant for supercooled liquids .",
    "additionally , here we add particles to the system of which diffusive dynamics are coupled with the existence of the active states . therefore , we require that active cells are necessary for the motion of packages because passive states block any packages diffusion . or in other words data are fixed and static as long as they are assigned to passive cells , but information may diffuse through a network of active cells . in the present work we will incorporate this features into the fock - space representation of the master equation in order to compute the packages concentration in a continuous mean - field - like approximation .",
    "firstly , we give a short survey about the fock - space method ( known as quantum hamiltonian as well - more details can be found in e.g.@xcite ) a certain state in our lattice system can be characterized by a set of discrete numbers @xmath15 ( or resp .",
    "@xmath16 ) where @xmath17 denote the local state of a lattice cell @xmath18 . furthermore",
    ", the following convention is used : @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is related to the active ( passive ) state , also denoted by @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the state @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) corresponds to a cell @xmath18 occupied ( non - occupied ) by a package .",
    "we start from the one - step master equation formulated in the following form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the probability for a certain configuration @xmath27 .",
    "the linear operator @xmath28 specified by the dynamics of the system describes the time evolution .",
    "then , following @xcite , the probabilities @xmath26 can be related to the fock - space state vector @xmath29 as a weight using the decomposition into the base vectors @xmath30 of a orthonormal vector space , @xmath31 this equation enables the quantum formulation for the master equation resulting in an equivalent manner @xmath32 where @xmath28 is assigned to the operator @xmath33 in the fock - space representation .",
    "the procedure had been originally derived for bose - like system @xcite and was later applied also to fermi - like systems @xcite .",
    "recently , we have proposed a further extension applying para - fermi statistics for different restricted occupation numbers @xcite .",
    "the average of a physical quantity @xmath34 is given by the trace over @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the reference state related to the base vectors by @xmath38 the reference state is completely determined by the base @xmath39 of the fock space and not assigned to the special model or to the evolution operator @xmath33 .",
    "the conservation of the total probability is manifested by @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the equation of motion is given by @xmath41 _",
    "{ \\_}\\mid f(t)\\rangle \\mbox{. }   \\label{equation - of - motion}\\ ] ] notice that the dynamical equation depends on both the algebraic properties of the underlying operators and the mathematical structure of @xmath33 .",
    "thus , we introduce the second quantized lowering @xmath42(@xmath43 ) and raising @xmath44(@xmath45 ) operators forming the evolution operator @xmath33 to create the base states @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) from a vacuum state @xmath48 . both types of ( independent from each other and hence commuting ) operators fulfil the relationship ( for paulions ) @xmath49 as mentioned above , the inherent properties of the fam is the restriction of the flip dynamics at cell @xmath18 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 where @xmath52 means a sum over all adjacent cells of @xmath18 and @xmath0 is the restriction number",
    ". the number operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote @xmath55 and @xmath56 as usual . concerning the motion of information packages we postulate a diffusive motion of the particles coupled to the existence of active cells at both related sites .",
    "this exchange process due to kawasaki enhances the mobility of packages in active neighborhoods whereas it slows down inside a passive cluster .",
    "summarizing we obtain the evolution operator taking the form @xmath57 \\hat{a}_{r}\\hat{a}_{s}+\\mbox{symmetric term }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the quantities @xmath58 $ ] , @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 are the kinetic coefficients of the diffusion process .",
    "they are appropriate thermodynamic weighted to fulfil the detailed balance condition .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 corresponds to the inverse temperature of a heat bath and describes the interconnectivity between the cells .",
    "the higher @xmath61 is set the lower is the interconnectivity of the network . the first term of @xmath62 reflects the flip process @xmath63 whereas the second term represents @xmath64 .",
    "the second part , @xmath65 , expresses the exchange process @xmath66 related to the existence of an active link between adjacent cells .",
    "the term in eq.([liouville ] ) @xmath67 represents the kinetic restriction which are mentioned above .",
    "the abbreviation @xmath68 denotes the sets of all the @xmath0 lattice cells neighbored to the cell @xmath18 .",
    "the operator @xmath69 yields a non - zero result only if the cell @xmath70 is an active one , so that the expression ( [ restriction2 ] ) differs from a zero value if it is applied to a cell of interest surrounded by at least @xmath0 active cells .",
    "using eq.([average ] ) the temporal evolutions of the two relevant observables @xmath71 and @xmath72 result in @xmath73 where we exploit the discrete form of the laplacian @xmath74 the diffusion coefficient is modified , @xmath75 , where @xmath2 is the length of the lattice cell . the current for the diffusive motion of the packages",
    "is given by @xmath76 it is intuitively obvious that the effective diffusion coefficient should be dependent on the squared concentration of the active cells , and therefore on the number of active links .",
    "because the formula for the vacancies concerns the same lattice index we may neglect it . within the next step",
    "we apply a mean - field approximation and decouple all average values .",
    "then , we obtain for the evolution equation of the packages @xmath77    \\label{mfa - vacancy}\\ ] ] whereas the equation of motion for the mobile / active state yields @xmath78 its temporal solution is easily given by @xmath79 \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{t}{\\tau _ { 1}}\\right )    \\label{solution - mobile}\\ ] ] with the initial value @xmath80 and the steady state solution @xmath81 as the inverse relaxation time of the flip process we find @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "notice that the steady state solution in mean - field approximation is equal to the solution for the paramagnetic lattice gas and independent of @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the relaxation time depends on @xmath84 . because the dynamics of the packages is globally conserved the steady solution is fixed for all time by the initial distribution , i.e. @xmath85",
    "testing the stability we analyze the eqs.([mfa - vacancy ] ) and ( [ mfa - liquid ] ) in a linear manner . assuming @xmath86 and @xmath87 are small fluctuations around the steady - state values we obtain by means of @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( @xmath90 is the fourier transformation of the local variable @xmath91 ) @xmath92 the divergence of the second relaxation time @xmath93 at the wave number @xmath94 reflects the global conservation of the information in our network . due to the quadratic dependence on @xmath95  the relaxation time @xmath96 rapidly increases if the active cells become passive .",
    "obviously , the steady state reveals as stable against pertubations indicated by the negative sign . to gain more insight into the diffusion process of the information associated with packages we consider its evolution equation ( [ mfa - vacancy ] ) applying the mean - field solution for the active state ( [ solution - mobile ] )",
    "this leads to a spatial independent , but temporal dependent effective diffusion coefficient with @xmath97 ^{2}\\bigtriangledown ^{2}\\langle v\\left ( t\\right ) \\rangle \\mbox{.}\\ ] ] a measure for the fluctuations of the packages concentration is given by @xmath98{0xb4}}% % beginexpansion { \\acute{}}% % endexpansion \\right ) \\rangle ^{2}dt% % tcimacro{\\unicode[m]{0xb4 } } % % beginexpansion { \\acute{}}% % endexpansion \\label{solution - vacancies } \\\\ & = & \\bar{a}^{2}t+2\\tau _ { 1}\\bar{a}\\left ( a\\left ( 0\\right ) -\\bar{a}\\right ) \\left ( 1-e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau _ { 1}}}\\right ) + \\frac{\\tau _ { 1}}{2}\\left ( a\\left ( 0\\right ) -\\bar{a}\\right ) ^{2}\\left ( 1-e^{-\\frac{2t}{\\tau _ { 1}}}\\right ) % \\mbox{. }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] studying the asymptotic limits of @xmath99 we recognize different temporal regimes .",
    "whereas for small times the fluctuations are dominated by the initial value of the active cells @xmath100 the fluctuations are approximated by @xmath101 for long times .",
    "although the fluctuations go to infinity in the long - time limit ( in this mean - field theory ) there is a ( quasi-)localization in an intermediate temporal range especially for small interconnectivity ( equivalent to low temperature ) .",
    "only a small part of all cells is active ( @xmath102 ) inhibiting the diffusion process .",
    "the exponential functions of the second and the third term in eq.([solution - vacancies ] ) are negligible so that the fluctuations @xmath99 remains almost constant . to see if there is a quasi - localization one must compare the relaxation time @xmath103 in eq.([relaxation - time ] ) and the time scale @xmath104 where the first term is equal the second and the third term in eq.([solution - vacancies ] ) . in this connection , we assume that the exponential functions may be neglected . the time @xmath104 associated with this point is ( supposing @xmath105 ) @xmath106 \\mbox{.}\\ ] ] obviously , a localization ( @xmath107 ) becomes only possible if the concentration @xmath95 is small enough ( sufficient low interconnectivity / temperature ) for the time interval @xmath108 . a rough estimation yields the ratio @xmath109 further , we may use @xmath99 to transform the partial temporal derivative of the evolution equation , @xmath110 and hence to obtain the ordinary diffusion equation @xmath111 applying the transformed eq.([mfa - vacancy ] ) @xmath112",
    "if we now start with a @xmath113-distributed information ( packages ) density , i.e. we drop down the information at one point and observe how the information will be distributed in the time , @xmath114 we get the result of the eq.([mfa - vacancy ] ) @xmath115 hence , the behavior of @xmath116 directly influences the diffusion of the information . if @xmath116 remains almost constant in a time regime the diffusion process and therefore the distribution of the information stops , and data packages are localized ( compare fig.[figure1 ] ) .",
    "in our extended facilitated kinetic ising model we find a ( quasi-)localization due to the coupling of the diffusive dynamics for data packages with the existence of the active cells at sufficiently low temperatures . because their part of all cells is small in this case so that the diffusion almost stops .",
    "therefore , the packages are fixed at or near the initial position , information can not be widespread .",
    "thus , we may separate two well - distinguished time regimes .",
    "first of all the fast flip ( or active - passive ) relaxation takes place .",
    "the higher the restriction number @xmath0 the more the relaxation time slows down ( compare eq.([relaxation - time ] ) ) . then after a while of the relaxed system of active - passive states sticking the packages the influence of the ( slow ) diffusion is remarkable , equilibrates the packages concentration ( information ) of the total system",
    "however , for high enough temperature there are a sufficient part of active cells so that the coupled diffusion can fasten the equilibration and information can easily spread through the network . like in @xcite for the fredrickson - andersen model",
    "shown mean - field approximation may provide false results .",
    "the mean - field solution leads to a dynamics which completely breaks down below a critical ( interconnectivity ) temperature .",
    "that means below a critical ( interconnectivity ) temperature information would spread through a fixed network like through a sponge ( bond percolation results would apply to this case , see e.g. @xcite . ) . here , we exploit a more sophisticate approximation , taking local processes into account .",
    "but we expect that the found quasi - localization alters in a permanent localization at low temperature if @xmath117 . because thus it exist stable clusters of passive cells at any temperature in contrast to the case @xmath118 where all cells can be activated @xcite",
    ". to prove this result one may study the theorem of van enter @xcite describing a bootstrap percolation model @xcite ( or diffusion percolation@xcite ) ."
