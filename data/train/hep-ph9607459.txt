    "over the last few years there has been renewed interest in the photoproduction of eta mesons and kaons from nucleons . at mami ( mainz )",
    "very precise differential cross sections for the reaction @xmath6 have been measured from threshold at 707 mev up to 800 mev photon lab energy @xcite .",
    "the nearly isotropic angular distributions show a clear dominance of the s - wave amplitude ( electric dipole ) in this energy range . at elsa ( bonn )",
    "an analogous @xmath7-electroproduction experiment has been performed @xcite at higher beam energies but with very low virtual photon momentum transfer , @xmath8 gev@xmath9 , thus the combined data cover the whole energy range of the nucleon resonance @xmath2 .",
    "the latter has the outstanding feature of a strong @xmath10 decay @xcite which is made responsible for the observed large cross sections .",
    "recently the incoherent @xmath7-photoproduction from the deuteron has also been measured at mami @xcite which allows for a preliminary extraction of the @xmath11 cross sections @xcite .",
    "upcoming coincidence measurements of the @xmath7-meson together with a recoiling nucleon will reduce the present uncertainties coming from the deuteron structure . at elsa",
    "there is an ongoing program to measure strangeness production with photons from proton targets .",
    "cross sections for the reactions @xmath12 and @xmath13 have been measured with improved accuracy from the respective thresholds at 911 and 1046 mev photon lab energy up to 1.5 gev together with angular distributions and recoil hyperon polarizations @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the neutral kaon channel @xmath14 ( considering the same energy range and observables ) is presently performed @xcite and will lead to a substantial improvement of the data base .",
    "the ultimate aim of these experimental investigations is a complete multipole analysis in the low energy region and in particular a determination of the s - wave multipole , @xmath15 , ( i.e. the electric dipole amplitude ) close to threshold .",
    "the knowledge of these multipoles will permit crucial tests of models for strangeness production .",
    "most theoretical models used to describe the abovementioned reactions are based on an effective lagrangian approach including born terms and various ( meson and baryon ) resonance exchanges @xcite with the coupling constants partly fixed by independent electromagnetic and hadronic data . in the work of @xcite",
    "it was furthermore tried to extract the @xmath16 coupling constant from a best fit to the data and to decide whether the @xmath16 vertex is of pseudoscalar or pseudovector nature .",
    "ref.@xcite used a k - matrix model with parameters adjusted to @xmath17 partial wave ( orbital angular momentum @xmath18 , total isospin @xmath19 ) of @xmath20 scattering and predicted quite successfully the cross sections for pion induced @xmath7-production @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath7-photoproduction involves as new parameters the photoexcitation strengths of two @xmath17-resonances which are furthermore constrained by pion photoproduction in the considered energy range .",
    "ref.@xcite finds a good description of the mami data whereas the elsa data above the resonance peak are somewhat underestimated .",
    "whereas resonance models work well for @xmath7-production the situation is more difficult for kaon production where several different kaon - hyperon final states are possible . as shown in @xcite resonance models",
    "lead to a notorious overprediction of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 cross section . only a drastic reduction of the @xmath24 coupling constant to nearly a tenth of its su(3 ) value gives a reasonable fit to all available data .",
    "this is clearly not a convincing solution to the problem .",
    "we will use here quite a different approach to eta and kaon photoproduction ( and the related pion induced reactions ) not introducing any explicit resonance .",
    "our starting point is the su(3 ) chiral effective meson - baryon lagrangian at next - to - leading order , the low energy effective field theory which respects the symmetries of qcd ( in particular chiral symmetry ) .",
    "the explicit degrees of freedom are only the baryon and pseudoscalar meson octet with interactions controlled by chiral symmetry and a low energy expansion .",
    "as shown in previous work @xcite the effective lagrangian predicts a strong attraction in certain channels such as the @xmath25 isospin @xmath26 and the @xmath27 isospin @xmath19 s - waves .",
    "if this attraction is iterated to infinite orders in a potential approach ( not performing the systematic loop expansion of chiral perturbation theory ) one can dynamically generate the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 as quasi - bound meson - baryon states with all properties attributed to these resonances .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the coupled channel potential approach to meson photo and electroproduction .",
    "to the order we are working this extension does not introduce any further parameter compared to the pure strong interaction case .",
    "it is then quite non - trivial to find a good description of so many available photon and pion induced data for this multi - channel problem with just a few free parameters .",
    "for both the strong meson - baryon scattering and the meson photoproduction processes we will consider only s - waves in this work . therefore the comparison with data is necessarily restricted to the near threshold region .",
    "the s - wave approximation excludes the calculation of observables like recoil polarization which arises from s- and p - wave interference terms .",
    "the systematic inclusion of p - waves goes beyond the scope of this paper and will be considered in the future .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we describe the effective su(3 ) chiral meson - baryon lagrangian at next - to - leading order and we present the potential model to calculate strong meson - baryon scattering and meson photoproduction simultaneously . in the third section",
    "we discuss our results , the low energy cross sections for the six channels present in @xmath28-proton scattering , @xmath29 , the cross sections of eta and kaon photoproduction from protons ( and neutrons ) @xmath30 and @xmath31 , as well as those of the corresponding pion induced reactions @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we furthermore make a prediction for the longitudinal to transverse ratio in @xmath7-electroproduction and discuss the nature of the @xmath2-resonance in our approach . in the appendix",
    "we collect some lengthy formulae .",
    "the tool to investigate the dynamical implications of spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking in qcd is the effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "it provides a non - linear realization of the chiral symmetry group @xmath34 in terms of the effective low energy degrees of freedom , which are the pseudoscalar goldstone bosons ( @xmath35 ) and the octet baryons ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the effective lagrangian can be written generally as @xcite @xmath37 corresponding to an expansion in increasing number of derivatives ( external momenta ) and quark masses . in the relativistic formalism",
    "the leading order term reads @xmath38)+ d\\ , { \\rm tr}(\\overline b \\gamma_\\mu\\gamma_5 \\{u^\\mu , b\\})\\ ] ] where @xmath39 a^\\mu + { 1\\over 8 f^2 } [ [",
    "\\phi , \\partial^\\mu \\phi],b ] + \\dots\\ ] ] is the chiral covariant derivative and @xmath40   a^\\mu + \\dots\\ ] ] is an axial vector quantity .",
    "the @xmath41 matrices @xmath42 and @xmath43 collect the octet pseudoscalar meson fields and the octet baryon fields , respectively . for later use the photon field @xmath44 has been included via minimal substitution with @xmath45 the quark charge operator .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath46 is the pseudoscalar meson decay constant ( in the chiral limit ) which we identify throughout with the pion decay constant @xmath47 mev . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the su(3 ) axial vector coupling constants subject to the constraint @xmath50 .",
    "the mass @xmath51 is the common octet baryon mass in the chiral limit , which we identify with an average octet mass .    at next - to - leading order the terms relevant for s - wave scattering",

    "two of the three parameters @xmath56 can be fixed from the mass splittings in the baryon octet @xmath57 in a best fit to the isospin averaged baryon masses using the charged meson masses one finds the values @xmath58 gev@xmath59 and @xmath60 gev@xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath61-term shifts the whole baryon octet by the same amount , so one needs a further piece of information to fix @xmath61 , which is the pion - nucleon sigma term ( empirical value @xmath62 mev @xcite ) @xmath63 with @xmath64 the average light quark mass . at the same time",
    "the strangeness content of the proton is given by @xmath65 whose `` empirical '' value is presently @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "if one stays to linear order in the quark masses , as done here , then both pieces of information ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) can not be explained by a single value of @xmath61 .",
    "we will later actually fit @xmath61 to many scattering data within the bounds , @xmath69 gev@xmath59 @xmath70 gev@xmath59 set by the empirical @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the experimentally unknown kaon - proton sigma term @xmath71 can then be estimated to linear order in the quark mass .",
    "the last two lines in eq.(5 ) comprise the general set of order @xmath72 terms contributing to s - wave meson - baryon scattering .",
    "they are written in the heavy baryon language with @xmath73 a four - velocity which allows to select a frame of reference ( in our case the meson - baryon center of mass frame ) .",
    "note that in comparison to previous work @xcite we use here the minimal set of linearly independent terms .",
    "the additional term @xmath74 can be expressed through the ones given in eq.(5 ) using some trace identities of @xmath41 .",
    "of course the physical content remains the same if one works with an overcomplete basis as done in @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath75 are not known a priori , but instead of fitting all of them from data we put two constraints on them , @xmath76 and @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the isospin - even @xmath20 s - wave scattering length and @xmath79 the isospin zero kaon - nucleon s - wave scattering length which are both very small ( @xmath80 fm @xcite , @xmath81 fm @xcite ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath78 includes the non - analytic loop correction proportional to @xmath82 calculated in @xcite , and we have corrected sign misprints in the formula for @xmath79 occuring in @xcite .",
    "in essence the relations eqs.(11,12 ) imply that these linear combinations of @xmath83- and @xmath84-parameters are an order of magnitude smaller than the individual entries .",
    "this completes the description of the @xmath41 chiral meson - baryon lagrangian at next - to - leading order and we conclude that there are only two combinations of @xmath84-parameters left free .",
    "these will be fixed in a fit to many scattering data .",
    "whereas the systematic approach to chiral dynamics is chiral perturbation theory , a renormalized perturbative loop - expansion , its range of applicability can be very small in cases where strong resonances lie closely above ( or even slightly below ) the reaction threshold .",
    "prominent examples for this are the isospin @xmath26 , strangeness @xmath0 resonance @xmath1 in @xmath28-proton scattering , or the @xmath2 nucleon resonance which has an outstandingly large coupling to the @xmath10-channel and therefore is an essential ingredient in the description of @xmath7-photoproduction . in previous work",
    "@xcite we have shown that the chiral effective lagrangian is a good starting point to dynamically generate such resonances .",
    "the chiral lagrangian predicts strongly attractive forces in the @xmath25 isospin 0 and @xmath85 isospin 1/2 channels .",
    "if this strong attraction is iterated to all orders , e.g. via a lippmann - schwinger equation in momentum space or a local coordinate - space potential description , quasi - bound meson - baryon states emerge which indeed have all the characteristic properties of the @xmath1 or the @xmath2 ( e.g. the @xmath27 isospin 1/2 quasi - bound state has a large branching ratio for decaying into @xmath10 ) .",
    "the price to be paid in this approach are some additional finite range parameters , which must be fitted to data . however , since we are dealing with a multi - channel problem , it is quite non - trivial to find a satisfactory description of the data in all reaction channels with so few free parameters .",
    "let us now describe the potential approach to meson - baryon scattering developed in @xcite and show how it can be generalized to meson photoproduction .",
    "the indices @xmath86 and @xmath87 label the meson - baryon channels involved .",
    "they are coupled through a potential in momentum space @xmath88 where the relative coupling strengths @xmath89 are , up to a factor @xmath90 , the corresponding s - wave amplitudes calculated from the @xmath41 chiral meson - baryon lagrangian eqs.(2,5 ) to order @xmath72 , which means at most quadratic in the meson center of mass energy @xmath91 and the meson mass . here",
    "@xmath92 is the total center of mass energy and @xmath93 and @xmath94 stand for the masses of the baryon and meson in channel @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "the potential @xmath95 is iterated to all orders in a lippmann - schwinger equation of the form @xmath96 with @xmath97 the resulting @xmath98-matrix connecting the in- and outgoing channels @xmath87 and @xmath86 . in eq.(15 ) the index @xmath99 labels the intermediate meson - baryon states to be summed over and @xmath100 is the relative momentum of the off - shell meson - baryon pair in intermediate channel @xmath99 .",
    "the propagator used in eq.(15 ) is proportional to a ( simple ) non - relativistic energy denominator with @xmath101 the on - shell relative momentum .",
    "the potentials derived from the chiral lagrangian have zero range since they stem from a contact interaction . to make the @xmath102-integration convergent a form factor parametrizing finite range aspects of the potential has to be introduced .",
    "this is done via a dipole - like off - shell form factor @xmath103 ^ 2 $ ] in eq.(15 ) with @xmath104 a finite range parameter for each channel @xmath99 .",
    "the form chosen here has the property that on - shell , i.e. for @xmath105 , it becomes identical to one . from physical considerations",
    "one expects the cut - offs @xmath104 to lie in the range @xmath106 gev to @xmath107 gev reminiscent of the scales related to two - pion exchange or vector meson exchange .",
    "we will actually fix the cut - offs @xmath104 in a fit to many data keeping in mind physically reasonable ranges .",
    "we note that other than dipole form of the off - shell form factor in eq.(15 ) have led to similarly good results .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation for the multi - channel @xmath98-matrix @xmath97 can be solved in closed form by simple matrix inversion @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the diagonal matrix with entries @xmath110 with @xmath101 and the appropriate analytic continuation ( @xmath111 below threshold @xmath112 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath113-matrix @xmath114 is exactly unitary in the subspace of the ( kinematically ) open channels ( but not crossing symmetric ) and the total ( s - wave ) cross section for the reaction @xmath115 is calculated via @xmath116 we note that the kinematical prefactor in eq.(13 ) has been chosen such that in born approximation , i.e. @xmath117 , the cross section @xmath118 has the proper relativistic flux factor .",
    "furthermore , one can see that the imaginary part of the born series eq.(16 ) truncated at quadratic order in the potential matrix @xmath119 agrees with the one of a one - loop calculation in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this is so because @xmath120 is the invariant two - particle phase space and the chosen off - shell form factor is unity on - shell .",
    "however , the real parts do not show chiral logarithms which would result from a proper evaluation of four - dimensional loop integrals .",
    "this concludes the general description of our coupled channel approach .",
    "we will first apply it to the six channel problem of @xmath4 scattering ( involving the channels @xmath121 ) .",
    "the corresponding potential strengths @xmath89 can be found in appendix b of @xcite , setting @xmath122 .",
    "secondly we use it for the four - channel system of @xmath123 states with total isospin 1/2 and the two channel system of @xmath124 states with total isospin 3/2 , with the corresponding @xmath89 given in the appendix .",
    "we now extend the same formalism to s - wave meson photoproduction . as in @xcite",
    "our basic assumption is that the s - wave photoproduction process can by described by a lippmann - schwinger equation . in complete analogy to our description of the strong interaction",
    "we will identify the s - wave photoproduction potential ( named @xmath125 ) with the electric dipole amplitude @xmath15 calculated to order @xmath72 from the chiral effective lagrangian .",
    "a welcome feature of such an approach is that it does not introduce any further adjustable parameter .",
    "consequently meson - baryon interactions and meson photoproduction are strongly tied together and the fits of e.g. the finite range parameters are controlled by both sets of data . for the description of the photoproduction reactions",
    "@xmath126 we have to know the photoproduction potentials @xmath125 for @xmath127 , where @xmath128 refers to the meson - baryon states with total isospin @xmath19 or @xmath129 and isospin projection @xmath130 .",
    "we label these states by an index which runs from 1 to 6 , which refers to @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , in that order .",
    "the resulting expressions involve as parameters only the axial vector coupling constants @xmath137 and @xmath138 and read @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are dimensionless functions depending on the center of mass energy @xmath142 and the mass @xmath143 of the photoproduced meson .",
    "@xmath140 takes the form @xmath144 and it sums up the contributions of all tree diagrams to the s - wave photoproduction multipole of a positively charged meson .",
    "the logarithmic term comes from the meson pole diagram in which the photon couples to the positively charged meson , and its analytic continuation below threshold ( @xmath145 ) is done via the formula @xmath146 if the photoproduced meson is neutral the corresponding sum of diagrams leads to a simpler expression , @xmath147 for the reduced s - wave multipole .",
    "infinitely many rescatterings of the photoproduced meson - baryon state due to the strong interaction are summed up via the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "this is shown graphically in fig.1 . the `` full '' electric dipole amplitude @xmath148 for channel @xmath86 is then given by @xmath149_{ij}\\,b_{0+}^{(j)}\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath119 is the matrix of the strong interaction potential and @xmath109 the diagonal propagator matrix defined in eq.(17 ) .",
    "we note that the `` full '' @xmath15 amplitudes fullfil watson s final state theorem , i.e. the phase of the complex number @xmath15 is equal to the strong interaction phase ( in this simple form the theorem applies only below the @xmath10 threshold where just one channel is open ) . from @xmath148 one",
    "can finally compute the total ( s - wave ) photoproduction cross section for the meson - baryon final state @xmath86 , @xmath150 the photon center of mass energy and @xmath151 in terms of the photon lab energy @xmath152 .",
    "we also calculate within the present framework the cross section for @xmath7-photoproduction from neutrons ( @xmath153 ) . for this purpose",
    "we have to know the photoproduction potentials for @xmath154 , where @xmath128 is a meson - baryon state with total isospin @xmath19 and third component @xmath155 .",
    "the respective potentials are distinguished by a tilde from the previous ones and read @xmath156 the reason for the second ( @xmath31 ) and third ( @xmath157 neutron photoproduction potential being zero is that here the final state involves a neutral baryon and a neutral meson to which the photon can not couple directly ( via the charge ) .",
    "thus the s - wave meson photoproduction amplitude vanishes to order @xmath72 in these channels .",
    "we will see later that the @xmath158 channel is very important for @xmath7-production off the proton and therefore the order @xmath72 result @xmath159 will lead to a too strong reduction of the @xmath31 cross section . to cure this problem ,",
    "we include for these double neutral channels @xmath160 the first correction arising from the coupling of the photon to the neutral baryon via the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath161 \\,\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath162 and @xmath163 are the anomalous magnetic moments of the neutron and the @xmath164-hyperon .",
    "the extension of our formalism to meson electroproduction ( in s - waves ) is straightforward . in electroproduction one",
    "has to consider two s - wave multipoles , the transverse one @xmath15 and the longitudinal one @xmath165 , which furthermore depend on the virtual photon momentum transfer @xmath166 .",
    "all steps previously mentioned to construct the s - wave multipole @xmath15 apply to the longitudinal @xmath165 as well .",
    "one only has to generalize the functions @xmath140 and @xmath167 to a transverse and a longitudinal version , which furthermore depend on the virtual photon momentum transfer @xmath166 .",
    "the corresponding somewhat lengthy formulae for @xmath168 and @xmath169 can be found in the appendix whereas the @xmath167-functions do not change , @xmath170 , with @xmath167 given in eq.(23 ) .",
    "this completes the discussion of the formalism necessary to describe meson photo- and electroproduction within our coupled channel approach .",
    "first we have to fix the parameters .",
    "for the six channels involved in @xmath4 scattering we work , as in @xcite , in the particle basis taking into account isospin breaking in the baryon and meson masses but use potentials @xmath89 calculated in the isospin limit .",
    "then the @xmath4 and @xmath171 threshold are split and cusps at the @xmath171 threshold become visible in the cross sections . in this six channel problem",
    "we allow for three adjustable range parameters @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "for the coupled ( @xmath174 ) system we work in the isospin basis as mentioned in section ii.b and use masses @xmath175 mev , @xmath176 mev , @xmath177 mev , @xmath178 mev , @xmath179 mev and @xmath180 mev , a choice which averages out most isospin breaking effects . here",
    "we allow for four adjustable range parameters @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "these seven range parameters and the two unconstrained combinations of @xmath84-parameters ( in the chiral lagrangian ) were fixed in a best fit to the data discussed below .",
    "we also allowed for optimizing the parameters @xmath183 and @xmath138 within narrow ranges .",
    "the best fit gave for the latter @xmath184 , @xmath185 mev and @xmath186 gev@xmath59 .",
    "the last number , together with the known @xmath187 leads to @xmath188 clearly , as expected the @xmath20-sigma term is too small if @xmath68 ( the strangeness content of the proton is small ) and the @xmath189-sigma term is in reasonable agreement with other estimates . for the other lagrangian parameters we find @xmath190 gev@xmath191 gev@xmath192 gev@xmath193 gev@xmath59 , subject to the two constraints eqs.(11,12 ) .",
    "note that these numbers are not directly comparable to those in @xcite , since here the linear dependent @xmath194-term has been eliminated .",
    "instead one has to compare with @xmath195 .",
    "the best fit of the range parameters gives @xmath196 mev , @xmath197 mev , @xmath198 mev and @xmath199 mev , @xmath200 mev , @xmath201 mev , @xmath202 mev .",
    "( we give sufficiently many digits here in order to make the numerical results reproducible ) . on sees that most of the range parameters are indeed in the physically expected two - pion to vector meson mass range .",
    "we also note that the best fit is very rigid and does not allow e.g. for a 5@xmath203 deviation of the parameters from the values quoted above .",
    "let us now discuss the fits to the data in detail .",
    "fig.2 shows the results for the six @xmath4 elastic and inelastic channels @xmath204 @xmath171 , @xmath205 @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 . as in @xcite",
    "one finds good agreement with the available low energy data below 200 mev kaon lab momentum .",
    "we present these results here just to make sure again that indeed a large amount of data can be fitted simultaneously .",
    "for the threshold branching ratios @xmath209 ( defined in eq.(21 ) of @xcite ) , we find here @xmath210 , where the numbers given in brackets are the empirical values . in fig.2 one",
    "observes cusps in the cross sections at the @xmath171 threshold , which are a consequence of unitarity and the opening of a new channel .",
    "unfortunately the existing data are not precise enough to confirm this structure",
    ". the status of the @xmath4 scattering data will improve with da@xmath211ne at frascati producing intense kaon beams at 127 mev lab momentum , and in particular once the planned kaon facility at kek will become available .",
    "fig.3 shows real and imaginary parts of the calculated total isospin @xmath26 @xmath212 s - wave scattering amplitude in the region @xmath213 gev @xmath214 gev .",
    "the resonance structure around 1405 mev is clearly visible . in our framework",
    "it is due to the formation of a quasi - bound @xmath215-state .",
    "it can decay into @xmath216 and thus receives its width of about 25 mev .",
    "we want to stress here that no effort has been made to prescribe the position or width of the @xmath1 below the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "fig.3 results by merely fitting the scattering data in fig.1 above the @xmath4 threshold ( together with many other data ) .",
    "the most precise data available are those for @xmath7-photoproduction off protons @xmath217 taken at mami @xcite from threshold at 707 up to 800 mev photon lab energy .",
    "these 54 data points of the total cross section ( full circles ) have the highest statistical weight in our fit and they can indeed be perfectly reproduced as seen in fig.4 . note that the measured angular distribution of the @xmath6 differential cross section @xcite are almost isotropic , thus one can safely identify the total cross section with the s - wave cross section . for the elsa data @xcite ( open squares ) from 800 to 900 mev photon lab energy one also finds very good agreement .",
    "angular distributions have not been published for this case , so we assume s - wave dominance .",
    "note that the elsa data stem from electroproduction with a very low virtual photon momentum transfer of @xmath8 gev@xmath9 .",
    "we have actually checked that the corrections from the nonzero @xmath72 and the longitudinal s - wave @xmath165 to the total cross section @xmath218 and @xmath219 ( virtual photon polarization at the elsa - experiment ) are negligible ( less than @xmath220 ) within error bars . for the s - wave multipole at the @xmath221 threshold",
    "we get @xmath222 this number decomposes as follows .",
    "the potentials @xmath223 have the values @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 ( in units of @xmath228 ) for the @xmath20 , @xmath10 , @xmath229 , @xmath27 channels , respectively .",

    "interestingly , it is the initial photoexcitation of the @xmath235 state which after infinitely many rescatterings to @xmath221 makes the largest contribution .",
    "the absolute value @xmath236 is in good agreement with determinations in models having an explicit @xmath2 resonance .",
    "our ratio of imaginary part to real part is 1.85 , somewhat larger than the typical values around 1 found in resonance model fits @xcite .",
    "however , since @xmath7-photoproduction is totally s - wave dominated in the first 100 mev above threshold , the real and imaginary parts can not be disentangled experimentally .",
    "fig.4 also shows the calculated cross sections for @xmath31 together with present ( preliminary ) extractions from the incoherent @xmath7-photoproduction on the deuteron @xcite .",
    "according to these the @xmath7-photoproduction total cross section from the neutron is 2/3 of the proton one with an uncertainty of @xmath237 .",
    "our calculation including the anomalous magnetic moment pieces @xmath238 gives a reasonable description of these data .",
    "however , the neutron to proton ratio is not just a constant 2/3 , but shows a stronger energy dependence .",
    "finally , in fig.5 we show the ratio of longitudinal and transverse s - wave multipoles @xmath239 for @xmath7-electroproduction from protons versus the virtual photon momentum transfer @xmath166 .",
    "the chosen total center of mass energy is @xmath240 gev , where the cross section is expected to be maximal .",
    "the ratio has a value of @xmath241 at the photon point @xmath242 and decreases rapidly , being close to zero at @xmath243 gev@xmath9 . in future @xmath7-electroproduction experiments at elsa or cebaf the longitudinal to transverse ratio @xmath239",
    "could be measured and it will be interesting to see whether there is indeed a depletion around @xmath244 gev@xmath9 .    in fig.6 we present results for kaon photoproduction , @xmath245 . in these channels the data are more sparse in the region up to 200 mev above threshold and the statistical weight of these data in our combined fit is therefore low .",
    "nevertheless one finds a good description of the first few data points in each channel . from the measured angular distributions @xcite only the first data point for @xmath246 and the first four for @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be considered as s - wave dominated .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath247 s - wave total cross section shows a strong cusp at the opening of the @xmath27-threshold , which again is a consequence of unitarity and multi - channel dynamics .",
    "the present @xmath248 data do not clearly show such a cusp and it may be covered by the p - waves which become sizeable above @xmath249 gev .",
    "interestingly if one divides out of the total cross sections the two - body phase space , @xmath250 indeed shows a maximum around @xmath251 mev , the @xmath27 threshold . only more data allowing for a multipole decomposition can clarify whether a strong cusp is present in the @xmath252 s - wave multipole at the @xmath253-threshold .",
    "note that the analogous pion induced reaction @xmath254 ( see fig.7 ) shows this @xmath27-cusp more clearly .",
    "the threshold value of the s - wave multipole is @xmath255 and at the cusp one finds @xmath256 .",
    "the first two data points for @xmath13 are somewhat overshot ( see fig.6 ) and we find @xmath257 for the s - wave multipole at threshold , which may be too large in magnitude . one finds however that the first few data points for @xmath13 do not follow the phase space . again , more data and a multipole decomposition are needed here .",
    "finally , we show in fig.6 the @xmath246 channel .",
    "this curve is really a prediction with no data included in the fit and , interestingly , the first data point of the recent analysis @xcite is reproduced .",
    "the data points further above threshold are not comparable to our s - wave approximation since the measured angular distributions in @xmath258 are strongly anisotropic . for the threshold value of @xmath15",
    "we find @xmath259 .",
    "note that our approach does not have the problem of overpredicting the @xmath246 channel , at least in s - wave approximation .      in fig.7",
    ", we show our results for pion induced eta and kaon production .",
    "the cross section data for @xmath7-production @xmath21 are the selection of @xcite , and the kaon production cross sections of @xmath260 and @xmath261 are taken from the compilation @xcite .",
    "the agreement of the coupled channel calculation with the data is very good even for energies considerably above threshold , except for the ( pure isospin 3/2 ) @xmath262 channel , where the s - wave approximation seems to hold only for the first data point .",
    "since the pion induced data have quite large error bars their statistical weight is low .",
    "therefore the good agreement with the existing data is a highly non - trivial consistency check of our coupled channel approach which simultaneously describes strong and electromagnetic meson - baryon interactions . as a byproduct of this calculation",
    "we extract the @xmath10 s - wave scattering length for which we find @xmath263 fm .",
    "its imaginary part is almost fixed by unitarity from the rise of the @xmath264 cross section and it is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "however , the real part of @xmath265 is almost a factor of 5 smaller than in the unitary resonance model calculation of @xcite .",
    "as recently pointed out in @xcite , @xmath266-meson exchange in the t - channel can equally well describe the @xmath267 total cross sections , but leads to a negative real part of @xmath265 .",
    "therefore we do not consider our small re@xmath268 fm as unrealistic .",
    "the peaks of the observed total cross sections in @xmath269 ( see fig.4 ) and @xmath21 ( see fig.7 ) at @xmath270 and @xmath271 gev , respectively , suggest the presence of an isospin 1/2 nucleon s - wave resonance , the @xmath2 .",
    "actually the resonance parameters ( mass @xmath272 and width @xmath273 ) are determined from a fit of the data using a breit - wigner parametrization with typical values @xmath274 gev and @xmath275 mev @xcite .",
    "however the closeness of the @xmath10 threshold ( @xmath276 mev ) causes peculiar features .",
    "the @xmath10 partial decay width is so strongly energy dependent that the breit - wigner curve @xmath277 decreases monotonically from the @xmath10 threshold onwards without showing a resonance peak . furthermore , speed plots ( absolute values of derivatives of partial wave amplitudes with respect to @xmath92 ) in @xcite derived from @xmath20 dispersion analysis show no structure in the @xmath17 partial wave at @xmath278 mev , but only the strong @xmath10 cusp and the second @xmath279 resonance . in @xcite",
    "a calculation of @xmath7-production has been performed using the analytically solvable lee - model and it was found that the data can equally well be reproduced with just a strong background instead of a @xmath2 resonance pole .",
    "the resonance poles actually found in this calculation lie on the wrong ( fourth ) riemann - sheet .",
    "let us now take a closer look at these issues in the present coupled channel calculation based on the chiral lagrangian .",
    "as first pointed out in @xcite the chiral @xmath27 isospin @xmath19 s - wave interaction is strongly attractive .",
    "it can thus built up a resonance - like state with the properties of the @xmath280 .",
    "in fig.8 we show that eigenphase of the four - channel @xmath113-matrix which below the @xmath10-threshold ( marked by an arrow ) joins continuously with the elastic @xmath17 @xmath20 phase .",
    "its value of @xmath281 at the @xmath10 threshold is somewhat larger than the empirical @xmath282 ( see fig.2a in @xcite ) .",
    "the eigenphase passes through @xmath283 at @xmath284 mev with a slope that can be translated into a full width of @xmath285 mev .",
    "these numbers ( in particular the one for the width @xmath273 ) are in good agreement with those attributed to the @xmath2 . however , as one goes up in energy the phase starts to decrease once it has reached @xmath286 at the @xmath27-threshold .",
    "as required for a clean resonance the phase does not change by @xmath287 .",
    "the situation is somehow similar to the isospin @xmath26 @xmath288 s - wave at @xmath289 gev where the phase of @xmath283 does not correspond to a scalar resonance but to a strong background .",
    "on the other hand the dynamically generated @xmath1 in the @xmath290-system is a clean resonance in this sense .",
    "the @xmath26 @xmath216 s - wave phase shift , which passes through @xmath283 at @xmath291 gev has moved above @xmath287 at the @xmath25 threshold .",
    "finally , we show in fig.9 the real and imaginary part of the s - wave multipole @xmath292 in the region @xmath293 gev .",
    "the curves show a resonance - like behavior with the real part of @xmath15 passing through zero at @xmath294 mev .",
    "obviously , in this restricted energy range a clean resonance and a strong background are indistinguishable from each other .",
    "we conclude that within our coupled channel approach , the questionable status of the @xmath2 ( resonance or a strong background ) is reconfirmed @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have used the su(3 ) chiral meson - baryon lagrangian at next - to - leading order together with a unitary coupled channel approach to describe simultaneously a large number of meson - baryon scattering and meson photoproduction processes . the extension to photo- and electroproduction",
    "is parameter free ( to order @xmath72 ) . by adjusting only 9 parameters ( 2 constants in the lagrangian and 7 finite range parameters )",
    "we are able to successfully describe a large amount of low energy data .",
    "these include elastic and inelastic @xmath4 scattering @xmath295 , eta and kaon photoproduction of protons ( and neutrons ) @xmath296 and @xmath31 as well as those of the corresponding pion induced reactions @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we do not introduce any explicit resonances , but generate the @xmath1 and @xmath2 as quasi - bound states of @xmath212 and @xmath27 .",
    "we furthermore took a closer look at the nature of the `` @xmath2 '' in this framework and find that it could well be a strong background instead of a clean resonance .",
    "naturally , the next step for improvement ( in particular the description of kaon photoproduction ) is the systematic inclusion of the ( strong and electromagnetic ) p - waves . given that the s - wave approximation does very well in many channels , this is nontrivial since the p - waves have to be rather selective in the various channels .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the p - waves derived from the effective chiral lagrangian can do this job .",
    "here we collect the explicit formulae for the potential coupling strengths @xmath297 for the four channel system consisting of the total isospin @xmath19 meson - baryon states latexmath:[$|\\pi n\\rangle^{(1/2)},\\,|\\eta n\\rangle^{(1/2)},\\ ,    indices 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , respectively ) and for the two channel system consisting of the total isospin @xmath129 states @xmath299 ( labeled by indices 5 and 6 ) . in this basis",
    "one has for the physical states , @xmath300/ \\sqrt3\\,\\ , ,   \\nonumber \\\\              the abbreviations @xmath302 and @xmath303 stand for @xmath304 the occurrence of @xmath305-terms in @xmath303 reflects the presence of the short cut singularities in the s - wave meson - baryon amplitudes below threshold due to u - channel baryon pole diagrams .",
    "unfortunately , the singularity of the @xmath306-pole term at @xmath307 lies slightly above the @xmath20 threshold and therefore some ( strong and electromagnetic ) s - wave potentials become singular at @xmath308 mev .",
    "in contrast to a proper four dimensional loop integration the used simple lippmann - schwinger equation in s - wave approximation is not able to get rid of this singularity in the @xmath98-matrix or @xmath15 .",
    "this feature prohibits a continuation of the present coupled channel calculation down to the @xmath20 threshold .",
    "the treatment of meson electroproduction requires the generalization of the @xmath140 and @xmath167 functions to a transverse and a longitudinal version .",
    "there is no change to order @xmath72 in the @xmath167 functions , i.e. @xmath309 .",
    "in contrast to this the @xmath140 functions become more complicated and depend furthermore on the virtual photon momentum transfer @xmath310 as follows : @xmath311 @xmath312 with the abbreviation @xmath313      * graphical representation of the lippmann - schwinger equation for s - wave meson photoproduction . the full ,",
