    "in the framework of the homogeneous and isotropic standard cosmological model , the dimming of the type ia supernovae as compared to their expected luminosity in an einstein  de sitter model is interpreted as a consequence of an assumed accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "this leads to the widespread belief in a ` dark energy ' component currently dominating the energy budget of our universe . but",
    "this is not the only possible explanation of the sn ia observations .    shortly after the discovery by riess _",
    "( 1998 ) and perlmutter _",
    "( 1999 ) of the supernova dimming , it was proposed by several authors that this effect could be due to the large - scale inhomogeneities ( pascual - snchez 1999 ; clrier 2000 ; tomita 2000 ; 2001a & b ) . after a period of relative disaffection , this proposal experienced a renewed interest about five years ago .",
    "three methods have been used to implement such a proposal : computation of backreaction terms in the dynamical equations using an averaging procedure proposed by buchert ( 2000 , 2001 ) , calculations in the framework of a perturbative scheme and the use of exact inhomogeneous models , in particular those of lematre ( 1933 )  tolman ( 1934 ) ( l  t ) ( see clrier 2007 , for a review ) .",
    "t model became rapidly popular for the purpose of mimicking ` dark energy ' because it exhibits three interesting features : i ) it is one of the few exact solutions of general relativity able to represent a physically consistent model of the matter dominated era of the universe , ii ) among these few , it is the most easily tractable from a computational point of view , iii ) it is not an alternative to , but a _ generalisation of _ the friedmann dust models ( which are contained in it as a subcase ) , so can reproduce all the friedmann - based results , including those of the `` concordance '' @xmath0cdm model , with an arbitrary precision . for more on this , in relation to the main subject of this paper , see the last section .",

    " t model is defined by two independent arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate , which can be fitted to the observational data . however , in most of the models currently available in the literature , the authors have artificially limited the generality by giving the l ",
    "t initial - data functions a handpicked algebraic form ( depending on the authors feelings about which kind of model would best represent our universe ) , with only a few _ constant _ parameters being left arbitrary  to be adapted to the observations .    another way in which the generality of the l ",
    "t models was artificially limited was the assumption that the age of the universe is everywhere the same , i.e. that the l  t bang - time function @xmath1 is constant . with @xmath1 being constant , the only single - patch l ",
    "t model that fits observations is one with a giant void ( iguchi _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ; yoo _ et al .",
    "conceptually there is nothing wrong with a non - simultaneous big bang ( even though this is a radical qualitative difference with the flrw models ) , but one should exercise caution when referring to @xmath2 as the actual age of the universe .",
    "t model is too simple to extend it up to instants earlier than decoupling .",
    "therefore @xmath1 should merely be regarded as a function that describes a degree of inhomogeneity of the initial conditions rather than as the actual instant of birth of the universe .",
    "the argument brought in defense of the constant @xmath1 assumption is this : a non - constant @xmath1 generates decreasing modes of perturbation of the metric ( silk , 1977 , plebaski and krasiski , 2006 ) , so any substantial inhomogeneity at the present time stemming from @xmath3 would imply ` huge ' perturbations of homogeneity at the last scattering .",
    "this , in turn , would contradict the cmb observations and the implications of inflationary models ( we deliberately do not give references here , to avoid blaming any single individual for what seems to be a piece of conventional wisdom ) .",
    "however , these are only expectations that should not be treated as objective truth until they are verified by calculations .",
    "such calculations have already been done , and it turned out that the inhomogeneities in @xmath1 needed to explain the formation of galaxy clusters and voids are of the order of a few hundred years ( bolejko _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ; krasiski and hellaby 2004 ; bolejko 2009 ) .",
    "then , on the basis of bolejko s ( 2009 ) models 4 and 5 , one can calculate that for a structure of present radius 30 mpc this age difference between the oldest and youngest region would generate cmb temperature fluctuations equal to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "this is well - hidden in the observational errors at the present level of precision .",
    "( in the future , when , presumably , the precision will improve , these results may possibly be used to _ measure _ the gradient of @xmath1 . ) so there is no observational justification to the assumption @xmath6 constant .",
    "these are the reasons why , in the recent years , we have seen the increase in popularity of void models , where the observer is located at or near the centre of a large , huge , giant l ",
    "t void of size of up to a few gpc .",
    "many authors have constructed classes of l ",
    "t models with a central local void and have shown that they were able to fit the sn ia and other cosmological data provided the void is large ( e.g. , it has a diameter of 400 @xmath7 mpc in alexander _",
    "_ 2007 ) or even huge ( e.g. , 1.35 gpc in alnes _",
    "_ 2006 , @xmath8 2 gpc in garcia - bellido & haugblle 2008a and 2009 ) , depending on the features of the particular model they had chosen .",
    "this contributed to the spreading of the belief in the necessity of a ` giant local void ' to resolve the ` cosmological constant problem ' with l ",
    "however , as shown by mustapha _",
    "( 1998 ) and used as an illustration for the application to the supernova data and the ` cosmological constant problem ' by clrier ( 2000 ) , a given set of isotropic data can constrain only one of the two free functions of an l ",
    "t model and therefore , after fitting the supernova data with a given l ",
    "t solution , we are left with plenty of room to accommodate more observations .",
    "actually , a few authors discarded the central void hypothesis and proposed models with no such void ( e. g. , iguchi _ et al .",
    "enqvist and mattsson ( 2007 ) even showed that the fitting of the sn ia data can be better with l ",
    "t models where the density distribution is constant on a constant - time hypersurface than with the @xmath0cdm model ( see also bolejko 2008 and bolejko & wyithe 2009 ) . even though such a density distribution is not what is actually observed at very large scales by astronomers ( it is not even observable , being in a spacelike relation to the central observer ) , the @xmath9 const configuration vividly illustrates how misleading the flrw - based geometrical intuitions can be . a spatial distribution of matter can radically change with time in consequence of an inhomogeneous expansion distribution in space .",
    "our models will provide more examples of this phenomenon , and we will come back to this point in the conclusion .    our aim here is to show , using two explicit examples reproducing the observational features of the @xmath0cdm model , that a giant void is not at all a necessary implication of using l ",
    "we propose to use input functions that can be derived from observations .",
    ", while what is actually observed is the flux .",
    "we can deduce the absolute luminosity only on the basis of some empirical methods .",
    "similarly with galaxy number counts  the cosmological model predicts @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an average mass per source and @xmath12 is number counts .",
    "the whole information about the galaxy evolution and their mergers is encoded in @xmath11  however in galaxy redshift surveys we observe only @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we do not focus on the problem of observations and assume @xmath13 and @xmath14 as in the @xmath0cdm . ] .",
    "t toy models will be constrained by the angular diameter distance together with the redshift - space mass - density or the angular diameter distance together with the expansion rate .",
    "it should be noted that these functions have not the same form in the @xmath0cdm model and in giant - void l ",
    "t models . for example , let us consider the giant void model from bolejko & wyithe ( 2009 ) with radius of 2.96 gpc and density contrast of 4.05 .",
    "the redshift - space mass - density for this model and for the @xmath0cdm model are shown in fig .",
    "as seen , at @xmath15 the difference between these two models is more than a factor of 2 .",
    "also , the expansion rate as a function of redshift behaves differently ( for details and constraints coming from @xmath16 see bolejko & wyithe , 2009 ) .",
    "thus giant void models have difficulties to mimic all the observational features of the dark energy model ( zibin _ et al .",
    "_ 2008 ; clifton _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we show that _ if _ the observational data are properly fitted to these @xmath0cdm functions , then a giant void is not mandatory to explain them .",
    "in fact the l ",
    "t models that mimic our choice of observational features of the @xmath0cdm model have a central gpc - scale overdensity rather than an underdensity .",
    "we emphasise that what we reproduce in our l ",
    "t model are not the actual observational relations , but the parameters of the @xmath0cdm model fitted to the observations  which is not the same thing .",
    "note that this model is not designed to reproduce all the available cosmological data , nor is it to be considered as the final model of our universe .",
    "its purpose is to exemplify the proper use of l ",
    "t models and to show what can come out of it .",
    "moreover , it should be understood as tentative beyond the redshift range in which the @xmath0cdm functions we use are robustly established .    as is usual in the study of l - t models ,",
    "we choose to use a comoving and synchronous coordinate system for the majority of this work .",
    "such a coordinate system is uniquely defined by the flow lines of the fluid and allows the line - element to be written in a simple form .",
    "however , it is of course the case that quantities such as energy density profiles on space - like volumes are sensitive to the choice of hypersurface on which they are recorded . to illustrate this dependence , and the effect of considering other foliations , we also present our final results on a set of hypersurfaces",
    "in which each fluid element is the same distance from the initial singularity along the world - lines of the dust particles .",
    "such a choice allows us to consider the energy density of different regions when they are at the same age , and becomes a comoving and synchronous coordinate system in the constant bang time models where giant voids have often been inferred .    in sec .",
    "[ lt ] we recall briefly the main properties of the l ",

    "the l  t model is one of two classes of spherically symmetric solutions of einstein s equations where the gravitational source is dust . in comoving and synchronous",

    "@xmath24 is the gravitational mass contained within the comoving spherical shell at any given @xmath25 , while @xmath18 is the energy per unit mass of the particles on that shell .",
    "moreover , @xmath26 determines the space curvature at each @xmath25-value .",
    "the mass density in energy units follows from the other nontrivial einstein equation and is @xmath27    the solutions of ( [ 2.2 ] ) can be written as @xmath28 where    1 .   when @xmath29 ( elliptic evolution ) : @xmath30 2 .",
    "when @xmath31 ( parabolic evolution ) : @xmath32 3 .   and when @xmath33 ( hyperbolic evolution ) : @xmath34    where @xmath35 is a parameter ( dependent on @xmath36 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "the @xmath37 is another arbitrary function that appears as an integration ` constant ' and is interpreted as the bang time , i.e. , the big bang is not simultaneous for all values of the @xmath25 coordinate .",
    "since all the formulae given so far are covariant under coordinate transformations of the form @xmath38 , one of the functions @xmath18 , @xmath24 and @xmath37 can be fixed at will by the choice of @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , once this choice is done , a given l  t model is fully determined by two of these arbitrary functions .    however , as shown by mustapha _",
    "( 1998 ) , and used as an illustration for application to the supernova data and the ` cosmological constant problem ' by clrier ( 2000 ) , a set of isotropic data corresponding to a given observable can constrain only one of the two free functions , and therefore the fitting of the supernova data , i.e. of the function @xmath40 , with a given l  t solution , still leaves the other function free  and available for fitting to another set of data .",
    "thus , we must also assume another set of initial conditions , e.g. the redshift - space mass - density @xmath10 or the expansion rate @xmath16 .",
    "we will take these functions to be identical to the corresponding functions in the @xmath0cdm model , assuming they reflect the observational data . by this",
    ", we want to show that there is no antagonism between the inhomogeneous cosmology and the @xmath0cdm model , and that the first can predict the same results as the second even if @xmath41 . however , whenever possible we present the real data to show that there is still much room within observational errors for different profiles .    using the reciprocity theorem ( etherington 1933 , ellis 1971 ) the luminosity distance can be converted to the angular diameter distance @xmath42    for a ray issued from a radiating source and proceeding towards the central observer on a radial null geodesic the following equation holds @xmath43 and the equation for the redshift reads ( bondi 1947 ; plebaski & krasiski 2006 ) :    @xmath44    for later reference we will need also the following equation , which follows easily from ( [ 2.10 ] ) and ( [ 2.11 ] ) : @xmath45",
    "our aim is now to show we can design an l ",
    "t model with no central void able to reproduce the angular diameter distance  redshift relation as inferred from the sn ia data , smoothed out as in the framework of a @xmath0cdm model . for this purpose",
    ", we propose to use the following additional conditions to specify the arbitrary functions @xmath24 , @xmath18 and @xmath37 .",
    "the algorithm used to find the l  t model reproducing the @xmath46 and @xmath12 data was first developed by mustapha , hellaby & ellis ( 1997 ) .",
    "let us recall its major steps and equations .",

    ". however , as we have made clear throughout , these profiles are the result of reproducing observables that match @xmath0cdm predictions , and not from fitting to any real data .",
    "luminosity distances from supernovae observations , and number counts from galaxy surveys do not currently extend much beyond @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively . as such , using real observables , it would only currently be possible to perform a reconstruction of a limited part of the full structure we have found here , and even then only up to the degree allowed by the errors associated with these quantities .",

    "our interpretation of a giant hump should therefore be understood as corresponding to an extrapolation of observable quantities under the expectation that they will follow @xmath0cdm , rather than being directly implied by any currently known observations themselves .",

    "this @xmath25 enters only as a parameter , and then automatically all the integration ` constants ' that appear while solving ( [ 2.2 ] ) are no longer constant , but are functions of @xmath25 .",
    "sophistication comes at the level of interpreting the solutions  however , this is no longer mathematics , but astrophysics .",
    "] is quite powerful and exhibits some features of general relativistic dynamics , like arbitrary functions in the initial data .    as we said earlier in this paper , the belief that an l  t model fitted to supernova ia observations necessarily implies the existence of a giant void with us at the centre",
    "was created by arbitrarily limiting the generality of the model . with its free functions fitted to @xmath0cdm features rather than to expectations",
    ", the giant void does not necessarily follow .",
    "rather , one alternative is that the graph of the density smoothed out over angles around us has the shape of a shallow and wide valley on top of a giant hump .",
    "this giant hump may be a feature of the particular l ",
    "t model that we ended up with .",
    "variations in the @xmath0cdm parameters would modify the details , and the observational constraints we considered are not very tight .",
    "future calculations with other constraints may favor a still different profile at @xmath155 now .",
    "hence we do not wish our paper to become a starting point of a new paradigm in observational cosmology , aimed at detecting the hump . before this happens",
    ", we must decide _ at the theoretical level _ whether the hump is a necessary implication of l ",
    "t models properly fitted to other observations .",
    "it must be stressed that this hump _ is not directly observable_. it exists in the space @xmath155 now , of events simultaneous with our present instant in the cosmological synchronisation , i.e. it is in a space - like relation to us .",
    "this is also the case of the giant void ( see , e.g. , fig . 4 of alnes _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ; fig . 1 of garca - bellido and haugblle 2008a ; figs .",
    "4 and 6 of yoo _ et al .",
    "however , an observational test of the giant void is easier to complete .",
    "the reason is that the models considered in this paper have a redshift - space mass - density almost the same as in the @xmath0cdm model ( see figs .",
    "[ s1_nc ] and [ s2_nc ] ) and as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ drs ] , their @xmath138 scales with the redshift in almost the same manner as in the flrw model , i.e. @xmath156 .",
    "this is not the case of the giant void which does not reproduce these features on the past light cone ( see figs .",
    "[ gnc ] and [ drs ] ) .",
    "thus , unlike the giant void , the giant hump is not observable in @xmath138 or in the number count data .     and [ dlhz - ahp ] ( gh ) and for the flrw model , where @xmath157 ( dashed line ) . the parameters of the gv model are : radius 2.96 gpc and density contrast 4.05 . the same model is presented in fig . 1 ; for details of how the model is specified and null gedesics solved see bolejko & wyithe 2009 . ]    what is the cause of this difference between the density distribution on our past light cone and in the @xmath155 now space ? it is the oft - forgotten basic feature of the l  t model ( and in fact of all inhomogeneous models , also those not yet known explicitly as solutions of einstein s equations ) : on any initial data hypersurface , whether it is a light cone or a @xmath155 constant space , _ the density and velocity distributions are two algebraically independent functions of position_. thus the density on a later hypersurface may be quite different , since it depends on both initial functions .",
    "whatever initial density distribution we observe can be completely transformed by the velocity distribution .",
    "for example , as predicted by mustapha and hellaby ( 2001 ) and explicitly demonstrated by krasiski and hellaby ( 2004 ) , any initial condensation can evolve into a void and vice versa . in flrw models , there are no physical functions of position , and all worldlines evolve together .",
    "thus , while dealing with an l ",
    "t ( or any inhomogeneous ) model , one must be cautious when applying the robertson  walker - inspired prejudices and expectations .    the use of oversimplified l ",
    "t models can create another false idea and false expectation .",
    "the false idea is that there is an opposition between the @xmath0cdm model , belonging to the flrw class , and the l ",
    "t model or in general , inhomogeneous models : either one or the other could be ` correct ' , but not both .",
    "this putative opposition can then give rise to the expectation that more , and more detailed , observations will be able to tell us which one to reject .",
    "in truth , there is no opposition .",
    "the inhomogeneous models , like for example the l  t model with its two arbitrary functions of one variable are huge , compared to flrw , _ families _ of models that include the friedmann models as a very simple subcase .",
    "the fact , demonstrated in several papers already ( see clrier 2007 , for a review ) , that even a @xmath158 l  t model can imitate @xmath159 in an flrw model , additionally attests to the flexibility and power of the l  t model .",
    "thus , if the friedmann models , @xmath0cdm among them , are considered good enough for cosmology , then the l ",
    "t models can only be better : they constitute an _ exact perturbation _ of the friedmann background , and can reproduce the latter as a limit with an arbitrary precision . while future observations , for example the ksz effect ( garcia - bellido & haugblle 2008b ) or the growth of linear structure ( clarkson _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ) ) will provide a sufficient insight to test particular configurations ( like for example a giant void model ) , we will never be able to reject inhomogeneous models .",
    "after all , the universe as it is , is inhomogeneous .",
    "nowadays we use homogeneous models just for simplicity , and although they have worked well so far , in future they will certainly be replaced by more sophisticated models , either by exact solutions , or what is more probable in light of increasing computation power of computers , by numerical simulations .",
    "when considering models that go beyond the flrw approximation , one may ask either ` what limitations on the arbitrary functions in the models do our observations impose ' , or ` which model best describes a given situation : a homogeneous flrw model or an inhomogeneous one ? ' the latter of these questions has often been asked in the context of comparing l - t models without @xmath0 to flrw models with @xmath0 , and is of much interest for understanding the necessity of introducing @xmath0 into the observer s standard cosmological model .",
    "such hypothesis testing questions are often posed in cosmology , but are difficult to address in the current context as they require artificially limiting the generality of the models in question ( in order to have a finite number of parameters , so that the test can be performed ) . given the lack of motivation for exactly how to perform such a limitation , one is then left in the undesirable circumstance of ( potentially ) dismissing particular l - t models , while being left with an infinite number of remaining l - t models to evaluate .",
    "we therefore prefer to consider the former question . in order to reasonably answer this for the l  t model , a general framework for interpreting observations in the l  t geometrical background should be created ( and in the future it should be transformed into a framework for interpreting the observations in a still more general , or _ the most general _ geometrical background ) .",
    "such a program is still in its infancy , but is being actually developed by c. hellaby and coworkers under the name ` metric of the cosmos ' ( lu and hellaby , 2007 , mcclure and hellaby , 2008 , hellaby and alfedeel , 2009 ) .    _",
