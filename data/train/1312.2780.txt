    "the popular garch model has the same structure ( [ eq : sv ] ) , but every @xmath5 feeds into the future volatilities @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and thus @xmath2 and @xmath3 are dependent in this case ; see , for example , the definition of a @xmath14  process in example  [ exam : garch ] .",
    "however , neither @xmath15 nor @xmath5 is directly observable , and thus whether we prefer a stochastic volatility a garch , or any other model for returns depends on our modeling efforts .    previous research on extremes ( e.g. , @xcite ) has focused mainly on stochastic volatility models , where @xmath16 constitutes a gaussian stationary process and @xmath3 is light - tailed ( e.g. , centered gaussian ) or rather heavy - tailed in the sense that there exists @xmath4 , a slowly varying function @xmath17 and constants @xmath18 such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 here and in what follows , for any ( strictly ) stationary sequence @xmath21 , @xmath22 denotes a generic element .",

    "sequence whatever the strength of dependence in the gaussian log - volatility sequence .",
    "in particular , @xmath8 does not have extremal clusters .",
    "it is common to measure extremal clustering in a stationary sequence @xmath21 by considering the _ extremal index _ ; suppose that an i.i.d .",

    "that is , this process does not exhibit extremal clustering .",
    "however , real - life financial returns typically cluster around large positive and small negative values .",
    "this effect is described by the garch model , which under general conditions has an extremal index @xmath34 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the lack of extremal clustering in stochastic volatility models is due to the conditions on the tails of distributions of the sequences @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in particular , we focus on the heavy - tailed situation when the distribution of @xmath9 has power law tails in the sense that there exist @xmath4 and a slowly varying function @xmath17 such that @xmath35 that is , @xmath9 is regularly varying with index @xmath6 , and @xmath23 has lighter tail in the sense that @xmath36 for some @xmath37 . by a result of breiman @xcite , we then have @xmath38 this means that the tail behavior of @xmath39 is essentially determined by the right tail of @xmath9 .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation mentioned earlier . in that case , also by breiman s result , @xmath40 .",
    "the latter relation is responsible for the lack of clustering ; it indicates that extreme values of the sequence @xmath8 are essentially determined by the extremes in the i.i.d .",

    "we mention in passing that extremal clustering also can be expected when both the tails of @xmath23 and @xmath9 are regularly varying with the same index @xmath4 . in that case",
    "it is well known ( see @xcite ) that @xmath39 has regularly varying tails with a slowly varying function @xmath17 , which in general is rather difficult to determine .",
    "we will not treat this case because it is of limited interest and will lead to rather technical conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:1 ]",
    "we introduce the notion of a regularly varying sequence and review point process convergence for such a sequence which was developed by  @xcite .",
    "we then state a result ( theorem  [ thm : main ] ) which translates mixing and regular variation of the sequence @xmath2 to the stochastic volatility model @xmath8 defined in ( [ eq : sv ] ) . our results in sections  [ subsec : ar][subsec:3 ]",
    "are concerned with three major examples . in section  [ subsec : ar ] we study the stochastic volatility model ( [ eq : sv ] ) , where @xmath2 is an exponential @xmath42 process with regularly varying marginals .",
    "we show that this model does not exhibit extremal clustering , due to the lack of extremal clustering in @xmath2 .",
    "we also show that an egarch model with the same volatility dynamics has no extremal clustering either .",
    "in section  [ subsec:2 ] we assume that a positive power of @xmath2 satisfies a random coefficient autoregressive equation , which we call stochastic recurrence equation . in this case",
    ", the extremal clustering of @xmath2 translates to the stochastic volatility model . in section  [ subsec:3 ]",
    "we consider another model with genuine extremal clustering . here",

    "a strictly stationary sequence @xmath8 is said to be regularly varying with index @xmath4 if for every @xmath43 , the vector @xmath44 is regularly varying with index @xmath4 .",
    "this means that there exists a sequence @xmath45 with @xmath46 and a sequence of non - null radon measures @xmath47 on the borel @xmath9-field of @xmath48 such that for every @xmath43 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes vague convergence and @xmath51 satisfies the scaling property @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
