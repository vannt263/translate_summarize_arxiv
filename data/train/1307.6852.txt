    "experimental progress in controlling ultra - cold atoms has opened a new chapter in our understanding of the properties of strongly - correlated many - body quantum systems @xcite .",
    "old fashioned theoretical toy - models known from condensed matter physics are undergoing a renaissance since they provide realistic descriptions of the real quantum systems confined in optical lattices ( specially arranged laser beams forming periodic potential @xcite ) . in the simplest case of ultra - cold bosons confined in such a potential",
    "the system is described by the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model , where single - particle tunnelings compete with local two - body interactions .",
    "the theoretical analysis of @xcite shows that this competition leads directly to the phase transition from insulating phase ( dominated by interactions ) to superfluid phase ( dominated by tunnelings ) .",
    "these predictions were confirmed in a spectacular experiment with ultra - cold rubidium atoms @xcite .",
    "many different extensions to the model have since been proposed and studied theoretically @xcite , and are now awaiting experimental verification .    in this article , the ground state phase diagram of a particular extension of the standard bh model is studied .",
    "mutual interaction between particles is assumed here to be of three - body origin , i.e. these dominate over two - body interactions .",
    "although this assumption seems very exotic , there are some possibilities of mimicking such a model in experiments with ultra - cold atoms confined in optical lattices . in the standard description three - body terms in hubbard - like models",
    "are introduced as an effective correction originating from interactions through higher orbitals of optical lattices @xcite .",
    "typically in such a scenario three - body terms are small corrections to dominant two - body terms , and they can be viewed as the first occupation - dependent correction to the on - site two - body interaction . due to perturbative changes of single - particle wave functions , the effective three - body terms are attractive ( for a repulsive gas ) @xcite .",
    "bh models with two- and three - body interactions have been studied in many different scenarios and using different numerical techniques @xcite .",
    "recently it was suggested that it is also possible to control three - body terms independently of the two - body ones .",
    "this can be done by exploiting internal degrees of freedom of interacting particles @xcite or via very fast dissipation processes @xcite .",
    "it also seems possible to control effective three - body interactions in the limit of high densities . in this limit",
    "three - body interactions can be viewed as an effective way of taking into account changes in electronic potential induced by a neighboring third particle .",
    "typically , these changes are very small and therefore can be neglected . nevertheless , if one tunes an external magnetic field to the value where the two - body @xmath0-wave scattering length vanishes , then three - body interaction induced by this mechanism dominates and in principle can be many orders of magnitude larger than two - body interaction .",
    "the consequences of a similar mechanism have been studied for the case of polar molecules interacting via long - range forces @xcite .",
    "on this basis we now assume that two - body interactions can be neglected and the on - site energy changes only when three- or more particles are present on a given lattice site . in the one - dimensional case",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads : @xmath1 where @xmath2 annihilates a boson at site @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is a local density operator .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is the single - particle hopping amplitude to the neighboring site and @xmath6 denotes the energy cost of forming a triplet on a given lattice site . for numerical calculations",
    ", it is assumed that the lattice has @xmath7 sites and open boundary conditions .",
    "the properties of hubbard - like models are strongly dependent on the average density @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is total number of bosons confined in the lattice . for example",
    ", it is known that for models considering on - site interactions only , the insulating phase can occur only for integer fillings @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to introduce a chemical potential @xmath10 and to rewrite the hamiltonian in the grand canonical ensemble @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the total number of particles operator .",
    "the phase diagram of the model is described in @xcite , and a similar extended bh model with non - local three - body interactions was recently studied in @xcite .",
    "to start we investigate the properties of the system in the limit of vanishing tunneling @xmath13 . in this limit , for any @xmath10 , all correlations between neighboring sites vanish and system remains in the mott insulator phase ( mi ) with integer filling @xmath14 .",
    "the grand canonical energy of the system is given by @xmath15.\\ ] ] from this relation one can easily find the boundaries of the insulating lobes ( i.e. values of chemical potential for which density changes by unity ) .",
    "the critical values of chemical potential for which insulating phase with filling @xmath14 is stable are given by @xmath16 for any integer @xmath14",
    "one finds the energy gap @xmath17 .",
    "this means that , in contrast to the standard bh model , insulating phases with larger fillings become larger .",
    "moreover for @xmath18 one finds that @xmath19 , i.e. the mi phase with @xmath20 does not exist at all in the system .",
    "to obtain the phase diagram of the studied system over the whole range of tunnelings , we follow the standard method based on energetic arguments @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the observation that in the mi phase , in contrast to the sf phase , a non vanishing energy gap for adding ( subtracting ) a particle to ( from ) the system always exists .",
    "it is therefore possible to obtain the upper / lower boundary of the insulating phase with filling @xmath14 for given tunneling @xmath5 , by finding numerically the ground state energy @xmath21 for @xmath22 particles and the ground state energies @xmath23 for system with @xmath24 particles respectively .",
    "the upper and lower boundaries of the insulating phase are therefore given by @xmath25,\\ ] ] as well as the energy gap within the phase @xmath26 in practice , phase boundaries obtained in this way depend strongly on the lattice size @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the energy gap for the sf phase vanishes only in the thermodynamic limit @xmath27 , and precise localization of the phase boundaries becomes ambiguous . to overcome this problem , we perform dmrg @xcite numerical calculations for different lattice sizes @xmath28 and extrapolate the obtained data to the limit @xmath29 .",
    "this extrapolation can be done quite easily as the boundaries @xmath30 treated as functions of lattice size @xmath7 fit almost perfectly to the linear regression with @xmath31 ( for discussion see @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] an exemplary case is presented for both @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this shows the accuracy of predictions based on linear data regression to the thermodynamic limit @xmath29 .     and lower @xmath34 boundaries of mi phase as a function of the inverse of the system size @xmath31 for two densities @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the solid lines are linear fits to the numerical data points .",
    "linear data extrapolation to the limit @xmath39 gives phase boundaries in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "numerical data obtained from dmrg for @xmath40 .",
    "[ fig0 ] ]    finally , the phase diagram of the system is obtained by plotting extrapolated values of @xmath41 as functions of tunneling ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the result is consistent with previous analytical predictions in the limit of vanishing tunneling . the second insulating lobe ( @xmath37 ) is broader than the first one ( @xmath35 ) in the direction of chemical potential as well as in the direction of tunneling",
    "this means that , in contrast to the standard bose - hubbard model , the critical tunneling @xmath42 for which system undergoes the phase transition from mi to sf phase is shifted to larger values for higher fillings .     is larger than the first one for @xmath35 .",
    "the phase diagram determined in thermodynamic limit @xmath43 by extrapolating the numerical data obtained from dmrg for @xmath40 .",
    "( right panel ) rescaled single - particle gap @xmath44 as a function of tunneling for @xmath35 ( red circles ) compared with analytical result obtained in third - order perturbation ( solid black line ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    from the numerical point of view the most problematic part of these calculations lies in determining the critical tunneling @xmath42 for which the system undergoes phase transition from mi to sf phase . theoretically , this point is defined as a tunneling for which the energy gap @xmath45 , calculated in the thermodynamic limit @xmath43 , vanishes .",
    "unfortunately , due to the numerical errors , this definition can not be adopted directly .",
    "the phase diagram obtained above allows us to estimate the critical tunneling @xmath46 for @xmath35 and @xmath47 for @xmath37 .    at this point",
    "it is worth comparing the energy gap @xmath48 obtained numerically to the analytical results obtained recently in @xcite . in that paper",
    "the authors perform perturbative calculations for a general bh model with two- and three - body local interactions ( for @xmath35 ) . in the third - order of perturbation with respect to the tunneling , in the particular case of vanishing two - body interactions",
    ", the result reduces to the form    @xmath49    as it is seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the energy gap obtained numerically fits almost perfectly to the predictions of .",
    "the deviations are clearly visible for larger tunnelings where the third - order approximation breaks down .",
    "in order to determine the critical tunneling more precisely two independent but complementary methods may be used .",
    "the first is based on the assumption that near the critical point the studied system belongs to the same universality class as the standard bose - hubbard model . at the phase transition the standard bh model in @xmath50 dimensions can be mapped to the @xmath51-dimensional xy model .",
    "therefore , in the one - dimensional case the phase transition belongs to the berenzinskii - kosterlitz - thouless class ( bkt)@xcite .",
    "as was shown recently , the universality class does not change when one extends the standard bh model with local three - body terms @xcite .",
    "this suggests , that even in the limit of vanishing two - body terms ( as studied here ) the universality class can remain unchanged .",
    "if true , this is a way to obtain the critical tunneling @xmath42 . indeed , for the bkt transition the energy gap @xmath48 in the vicinity of the critical tunneling @xmath42 , vanishes as @xmath52.\\ ] ] therefore , if the critical tunneling @xmath42 was known and indeed the relation would hold , then by plotting @xmath53 against @xmath54 the data points should follow a linear regression .",
    "moreover , this can happen only for a unique value of @xmath42 and , due to uniques of the relation , only if the transition is of bkt type .",
    "plots in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show that the bkt scaling is satisfied with an appropriately chosen critical value of the tunneling @xmath42 . in this way we confirm that the phase transition is indeed of bkt type .",
    "values of critical tunneling obtained in this way are @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "uncertainties in the critical tunnelings may be estimated from comparison of the results obtained for different system sizes @xmath57 .",
    "in all these cases the critical tunneling differs from estimated values by no more than estimated uncertainties .     as a function of tunneling @xmath5 for two integer fillings @xmath32 ( upper panel ) and @xmath33 ( bottom panel ) . with this scaling the numerical points fit to the linear behavior predicted by the kosterlitz - thouless universality class .",
    "this suggests that studied model belongs to the same universality class as standard bose - hubbard model .",
    "numerical data obtained from dmrg for @xmath58 . in the insets the correlation functions @xmath59 ( red solid line ) and @xmath60 ( blue dashed line ) as functions of tunneling @xmath61 are presented .",

    "[ fig2 ] . for both fillings studied ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) ,",
    "in the vicinity of the phase transition the three - body correlation @xmath60 changes its behavior , which can be viewed as a changing of ground - state properties .",
    "note however that in the limit of large tunneling , both correlation functions necessarily approach the values of the standard bh model .",
    "the phase transition from the mi to sf phase can be also identified using a complementary method , by looking for changes in the behavior of the entanglement entropy ( ee ) of the subsystem @xmath65 $ ] . here , @xmath66 is the reduced density matrix of the subchain of length @xmath67 obtained by tracing - out remaining degrees of freedom from the ground state of the system @xmath68 .",
    "the scaling behavior of the ee is well known in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. when @xmath29 . in the sf phase , due to",
    "the nonlocal correlations in the system , ee treated as a function of size of the subsystem is logarithmically divergent with @xmath67 .",
    "in contrast , in the mi phase , long - range correlations vanish and therefore entanglement entropy saturates for large enough subsystem sizes @xmath67 .",
    "these facts have some consequences also for finite size @xmath7 of the full system . as predicted by conformal field theory , depending on the boundary conditions , in the sf phase entanglement entropy is the following function function of @xmath67 @xcite @xmath69 + s(l ) + { \\cal o}\\left(\\frac{l}{l}\\right).\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath70 depends on the boundary conditions and is equal to @xmath71 or @xmath72 for periodic or open boundary conditions respectively .",
