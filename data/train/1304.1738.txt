    "following einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) , a physical theory is considered _ complete _ when there is a one - to - one correspondence between its elements and what are called the _ elements of reality _ of the physical system that the theory aims to depict .",
    "starting from the locality assumption , in the famous epr paradox @xcite it is argued that there exist physical systems , based on entanglement between different degrees of freedom , which are characterized by elements of reality that do not have counterparts in the quantum theory . in this sense , therefore , quantum mechanics was said to be an incomplete theory . following the seminal _ gedanken _ experiment proposed by epr ,",
    "many scientists have tried to look for different theories , by introducing additional variables to the quantum ones , that recover the lack of knowledge ( incompleteness ) of the quantum theory ; these additional variables are known as _ hidden variables _ , because there is no known way to detect them experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the experimental violation of bell inequalities has ruled out all possible forms of _ local hidden variable theories _",
    ", thus proving the impossibility of building up a theory that could recover both locality and so - called `` realism '' at the same time  @xcite . in 2003 , a.  j.  leggett formulated a new incompatibility theorem between quantum mechanics and a subclass of _ non - local _ hidden variable theories , named `` crypto non - local ''  @xcite . in recent years , this ( class of ) non - local realism has been investigated in several experiments .",
    "the associated inequalities , named leggett s inequalities , were also found to be experimentally violated , thus ruling out also this class of non - local hidden variables theories  @xcite .    in all of the hitherto addressed experiments , the same degree of freedom of two entangled individual parties , for example the polarization of two entangled photons generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion ,",
    "was used to test the leggett inequalities .",
    "however , entanglement is not limited to a many particle system : separate degrees of freedom of a same particle can be used to generate a single particle entangled state . in such state ,",
    "two ( or more ) observables of the particle may have a fully undetermined random value , but the overall quantum state of the particle is pure , thus implying the presence of strong correlations between the involved observables .",
    "such correlations may then be tested against the predictions of hidden variable models .",
    "the bell inequalities ( or , alternatively , the tests of the kochen - specker kind ) , in this case , probe the so - called `` non - contextuality '' of the observables , i.e. the assumption that the value of each observable as determined by the hidden values can not be affected by the choice of measurement settings in place for other independent observables  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the leggett inequality goes beyond this , by testing the possible validity of a class of hidden - variable models , independently of the assumption for non - contextuality of the observables . following leggett",
    ", we might call this class of models `` crypto - contextual '' models",
    ". a violation of leggett s inequalities , therefore , negates the possible existence , before the act of measurement , of any elements of reality of the specific kind postulated in such crypto - contextual models .    in this article",
    ", we test a set of leggett inequalities for single photons prepared in entangled states of the following two observables : spin angular momentum ( sam ) and orbital angular momentum ( oam ) .",
    "sam and oam are respectively associated with the polarization and the wave front of an optical field and hence are fully independent observables in the paraxial limit  @xcite . in quantum optics , sam lives in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) hilbert space , while oam corresponds to an unbounded , infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "however , we will use only a 2d subspace of oam , thus mimicking a second spin state . in order to generate the single photon sam - oam entangled state",
    ", we exploited the spin - to - orbital coupling taking place in a suitably - patterned liquid crystal cell , named @xmath0-plate  @xcite .",
    "similar applications of such device for quantum information experiments have been demonstrated in a number of recent works  @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , our experimental data for the sam - oam correlations were found to be in agreement with the quantum predictions and violating the leggett s bound , with a maximum violation of seven standard deviations .",
    "this rules out with high confidence the possible validity of crypto - contextual hidden variable models for the single - photon sam - oam hybrid correlations .    .",
    "north and south poles of the corresponding sphere then represent @xmath1 and @xmath2 , corresponding to the laguerre - gauss modes lg@xmath3 and lg@xmath4 , respectively ( with the radial number @xmath5 ) . the equator of the oam poincar sphere corresponds to hermite - gauss modes , as given by a balanced superposition of the lg@xmath3 and lg@xmath4 modes .",
    "the small insets in panel ( b ) show the intensity distribution patterns for some of these oam modes.,width=340 ]",
    "in leggett s model , we consider a physical system consisting of two 2d subsystems x and y and two corresponding observables . in the original paper , the sam ( polarization ) of two correlated photons",
    "was used , while in this article we take x to be the sam and y a 2d subspace of oam of a single photon . for",
    "each of these observables , two observers alice and bob perform projective measurements specified by unit vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 on x and y , respectively .",
    "these vectors single out a state in the two - dimensional space and can be hence represented as unit vectors in the poincar sphere , as shown in fig .",
    "[ poincare ] .",
    "the result @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) obtained by alice ( bob ) is a dichotomous variable , taking the possible values @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath10 is the outcome when the system is detected in state @xmath6 ( @xmath12 ) , and @xmath11 when it is found to be orthogonal to state @xmath6 ( @xmath12 ) . in the crypto - contextual models , these possible outcomes are pre - determined ( either deterministically or stochastically ) by a set of hidden variables @xmath13 , defined in a domain @xmath14 .",
    "due to our lack of knowledge about these hidden variables , all measured quantities result from an average in the hidden variable domain , weighted by the probability distribution @xmath15 that the system is in state @xmath13 .    in the original model proposed by leggett @xcite ,",
    "the hidden variables @xmath13 are defined by assigning a specific `` hidden '' spin - like state @xmath16 to x and @xmath17 to y , where these vectors live in the corresponding poincar spheres .",
    "this is done even if the overall quantum state is prepared in an entangled state for which the individual subsystems x and y would have no definite quantum state .",
    "the expectation values for the observables x and y with measurement settings @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , are then assumed to be given by the following expressions : @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the correlation @xmath22 between measurements performed by alice and bob are given by the expression @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a joint probability that the outcome of alice and bob projective measurement on @xmath6 and @xmath7 are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the model allows for contextuality of the two observables x and y , because this joint probability is in general non - separable , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "this in particular implies that each individual measurement outcome @xmath8 of observable @xmath26 may in general depend on the observable @xmath27 settings @xmath7 , and possibly even on its simultaneous outcome @xmath9 , and vice versa .",
    "however , it should be noted that eqs .",
    "( [ avexy ] ) do imply a `` non  signalling '' condition , so that each average value of a given observable is taken to be independent of the measurement settings of the other observable .    for this model , branciard _ et al .",
    "_ derived a simplified version of leggett - type inequalities  @xcite , which we will adopt here for our tests .",
    "this inequality involves three measurements on x along the vectors @xmath28 and six on y , along the vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , with the following constraints : the three vector pairs @xmath32 form a same angle @xmath33 , their differences @xmath34 must be three mutually orthogonal vectors , and their sums @xmath35 must be respectively parallel to the @xmath28 .",
    "when these conditions are satisfied , leggett s model gives rise to the following inequality  @xcite : @xmath36 quantum mechanics , on the other hand , predicts a violation of this inequality .",
    "indeed , if the system is prepared in a maximally entangled state of the observables x and y , such as for example @xmath37 , the correlation coefficients predicted by quantum mechanics are given by @xmath38 from which we obtain @xmath39 this function @xmath40 is above the leggett bound of @xmath41 for a wide range of values of the angle @xmath33 , as we will show further below .",
    "the layout of our experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ setup ] .",
    "the two - photon source ( not shown in the figure ) is based on a @xmath42-barium borate nonlinear crystal cut for degenerate collinear type - ii phase matching , pumped by a linearly polarized beam at a wavelength of @xmath43 nm and at 100 mw of average power .",
    "the latter was obtained from the second harmonic of a ti : sapphire pulsed laser beam with a 100 fs pulse duration and 82 mhz repetition rate at the fundamental wavelength of 795 nm . for collinear type - ii phase matching ,",
    "the photon pair generated via spontaneous parametric down conversion is in the product state of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote horizontal and vertical linear polarizations , respectively .",
    "the two photons are then separated by a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "the @xmath46-polarized photon was coupled directly to an avalanche single photon detector ( d@xmath47 ) by an appropriate set of lenses and mirrors and was used as trigger .",
    "the @xmath45-polarized photon , transmitted by the pbs , is used to perform the sam - oam measurements , by detecting the coincidences with the trigger photon , so as to operate in a heralded - single - photon quantum regime .",
    "a tuned @xmath0-plate with topological charge @xmath48 was used to prepare the spin - orbit state of the photon @xcite .",
    "in particular , for a circularly polarized input photon , the @xmath0-plate flips the polarization helicity and simultaneously imparts @xmath49 of oam to the photon , with the @xmath50 sign depending on the input polarization helicity .",
    "in other words , the @xmath0-plate gives rise to the following photon transformation laws : @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 label the sam and oam degrees of freedom , respectively , @xmath55 and @xmath56 stand for the left and right circular polarizations , and @xmath57 denotes an oam eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath58 , such as for example a laguerre - gauss ( lg ) mode with azimuthal index @xmath59 . the radial mode , as for example denoted by the lg index @xmath60 , is irrelevant for our purposes , and",
    "it can be assumed hereafter to be fixed to @xmath5 , as determined by the final detection mode .",
    "now , a @xmath45 polarization state can be written as a superposition of left and right circular polarizations , i.e. @xmath61 .",
    "hence , the @xmath45-polarized photon transmitted by the pbs is transformed by the @xmath0-plate into the following maximally - entangled spin - orbit state : @xmath62 it is worth noticing that the final state @xmath63 generated by the @xmath0-plate belongs to a four - dimensional hilbert space defined as direct product of the sam space and the oam 2d subspace with @xmath64 .",
    "such hilbert space is for example spanned by the four product states @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "- single - photon detectors.,width=340 ]    the heralded photon prepared in the single - photon sam - oam entangled state @xmath69 was then sent to the detection apparatus , where its sam and oam values , corresponding to observables x and y , were both measured .",
    "the projective measurement on the sam state of the photon was singled out by means of a properly - oriented sequence of a half - wave plate , a quarter - wave plate , and a polarizer .",
    "the orientations of the two wave plates define the selected projection state @xmath6 of the measurement , in the sam poincar sphere ( fig .",
    "[ poincare ] ) .",
    "then , the oam measurement was achieved by diffraction on a spatial light modulator ( slm ) followed by a spatial - filter system composed of a lens , a 100x microscope objective , and a pinhole having a 1 mm radius .",
    "the oam projection state corresponding to each vector @xmath19 in the oam poincar sphere of @xmath70 was thus determined by the hologram pattern visualized on the slm , as was computed statically by a computer - generated - holography technique @xcite .",
    "the spatial filter was used to select only the tem@xmath71 gaussian component of the diffracted beam in the far - field zone .",
    "the selected photon , after both projections , was finally coupled to another avalanche single - photon detector d@xmath72 .",
    "the signals from the two detectors d@xmath47 and d@xmath73 were read out by a coincidence box and a digital counter .",
    ", @xmath74 . the oam states @xmath75 and",
    "@xmath76 were also taken along the equator line , at symmetrical azimuthal angles @xmath77 relative to @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , @xmath79 and @xmath80 were taken along the equator line , at symmetrical angles @xmath77 relative to @xmath81 .",
    "finally , @xmath82 and @xmath83 were taken along a meridian line , at symmetrical polar angles @xmath77 relative to @xmath84 .",
    "examples of the computer - generated holograms needed to measure these oam states are shown in the right inset , with @xmath85 and @xmath86 representing the polar and azimuthal angles ( in degrees ) on the oam poincar sphere , respectively.,width=321 ]    the experimental correlation coefficients @xmath87 between the measurements of sam and oam are computed as @xmath88 where @xmath89 are the experimental coincidence counts between the detectors d@xmath47 and d@xmath73 when the sam and oam projections are set to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively  @xcite .",
