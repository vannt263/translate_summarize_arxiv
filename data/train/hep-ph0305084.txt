    "<S> we find , however , as the center - of - mass energy increases ( @xmath5 gev ) the production through two virtual photons @xmath6 will prevail over that through one virtual photon , because in the former process the photon fragmentation into @xmath7 and into the charmed quark pair becomes more important at higher energies . </S>",

    "<S> because of the simpler parton structure involved , which will reduce the theoretical uncertainty , charmonium production in @xmath1 annihilation is expected to be more decisive in clarifying the production mechanisms of heavy quarkonia . </S>",
    "<S> the two b factories with babar and belle are collecting huge data samples of continuum @xmath1 annihilation events , which will allow us to have a fine data analysis for charmonium production . </S>",
    "<S> recently , charmonium production in @xmath1 annihilation has become more interesting and puzzling , because of the large gap between the belle measurements@xcite and the theoretical calculations for both inclusice@xcite and exclusive @xcite charmonium production via double @xmath9 pairs based on nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) .    </S>",
    "<S> for the inclusive processes , belle has reported a measurement on the @xmath7 production in @xmath1 annihilation at @xmath2 gev@xcite , and found that a very large fraction of the produced @xmath7 is due to the double @xmath9 production in @xmath1 annihilation@xcite    @xmath10    which corresponds to @xcite @xmath11    in contrast , the predicted values for the cross section in nrqcd ( the color - octet contribution is negligible for this process ) are much smaller than the data@xcite . in a recent analytical calculation and numerical estimation for the inclusive charmonia production including all s - wave , p - wave and d - wave states via double @xmath9 in nrqcd@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath12 this value is consistent with other previous calculations , including those obtained based on the quark - hadron duality hypothesis@xcite , but smaller than the belle data by about a factor of six .    for the exclusive processes , the belle measurement@xcite for the cross section of @xmath13 is about an order of magnitude larger than the nrqcd calculation for @xmath14@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in order to solve the problem , calculations for the exclusive double - charmonium production from @xmath1 annihilation into two virtual photons are performed@xcite , and it is pointed out that the cross section for @xmath15 is larger than that for @xmath16 by about a factor of 3.7 , despite of possible uncertainties due to the choice of input parameters@xcite . this is a interesting result since it indicates that the @xmath1 annihilation through two virtual photon fragmentation may make important contributions to certain processes , and it might substantially reduce the discrepancy between experiment and theory for the exclusive process @xmath17 ( note that it is essential to check experimentally whether @xmath18 is largely misidentified with @xmath13 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , it is necessary to examine the contribution of @xmath1 annihilation through two virtual photons to the inclusive production of @xmath7 . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will calculate the complete o@xmath19 color - singlet inclusive cross section for @xmath20 , and compare the production rate through two virtual photons with that through one virtual photon , to see whether the annihilation through two virtual photons can decrease the discrepancy between the belle measurement on @xmath21 production and the calculations based on nrqcd .    </S>",

    "<S> the input parameters used in the numerical calculations are the same as in ref.@xcite @xmath44 @xmath45    now we give the numerical result at the belle energy @xmath2 gev :    @xmath46        it is well known that @xmath47 is a pure electromagnetic process ( except for the hadronization of the quark pair at long distances ) , while @xmath48 involves both electromagnetic and strong interactions . for a naive order of magnitude estimate , the ratio of the production rate of the former to the latter would be proportional to @xmath49 , but the photon fragmentation into @xmath7 and into the charmed quark pair can substantially enhance the former . to see the role of photon fragmentation , we plot the differential cross sections of @xmath50 and @xmath51 as functions of the scattering angle of @xmath7 at @xmath2gev in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> ( here for the one - photon process we choose @xmath520.26 . ) </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the small angle @xmath7 production in @xmath53 is dominant . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that most of the @xmath7 production comes from the photon fragmentation ( corresponding to the upper graph in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ feynman ] with one photon fragmenting to @xmath7 and the other fragmenting to a charm quark pair ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , our calculation shows that at @xmath2gev , the contribution from fragmentation graphes is about seventy - two percent of the total cross section . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ratio ] we show the ratio of the fragmentation contribution to the total cross section as a function of the @xmath1 center - of - mass energy in @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the photon fragmentation becomes more and more dominant as the center - of - mass energy increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the observation in the @xmath55 exclusive production through two virtual photons@xcite .    from the above discussions we have seen the importance of the photon fragmentation to @xmath7 as well as to the charm </S>",
    "<S> quark pair in the two - photon process @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> a even more crucial result is that at high @xmath1 center - of - mass energies the contribution through two virtual photons will prevail over that through one virtual photon in the production of @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason lies simply in the fact that the virtuality of the photon in the two - photon process can be as small as @xmath56 , whereas it is as large as @xmath57 , the center - of - mass energy squared in the one - photon process . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ num ] we show the cross sections of @xmath54 ( solid line ) and @xmath58 ( dotted line ) as functions of the center - of - mass energy @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> we see clearly that the cross section for @xmath54 decreases very slowly , whereas that for @xmath60 decreases rapidly as @xmath59 increases . at @xmath61 gev , </S>",
    "<S> the two photon process becomes to prevail over the one photon process .    </S>",
    "<S> however , unfortunately , at the belle energy @xmath2 gev , since the enhancement effect due to the factor @xmath62 is not large enough as compared with the suppression factor @xmath49 , we find @xmath63 fb , which is still much smaller than @xmath64 fb@xcite , and therefore is negligible .     </S>",
    "<S> ( solid line ) and @xmath60 ( dotted line ) as functions of the center - of - mass energy , width=453,height=377 ]    in summary , we have calculated the complete @xmath65 color - singlet inclusive cross sections for @xmath21 production from @xmath66 annihilation into two photons . due to the suppression factor of @xmath49 , </S>",
    "<S> at the @xmath1 center - of - mass energy @xmath2 gev the cross section of this process is smaller by about a factor of six than that from @xmath66 annihilation into one photon . </S>",
    "<S> we then conclude that while the @xmath66 annihilation into two photons could be helpful in solving the puzzle for the exclusive @xmath67 production , it can do very little to reduce the big gap between the observed inclusive production cross section of @xmath68 pb and the current nrqcd predictions of about 0.15 pb . </S>",
    "<S> this puzzle still needs to be explained with new theoretical considerations . </S>",
    "<S> we find , however , as the center - of - mass energy increases(@xmath6920 gev ) the production through two photons @xmath50 will prevail over that through one photon , because in the former case the photon fragmentation into @xmath7 and into the charmed quark pair becomes more important at higher energies . </S>"
