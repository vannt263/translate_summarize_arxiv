    "the main purpose of this work is the to verify the soundness of what we had previously published ( mana _ et al . _ , 2004 ) . on that occasion ,",
    "we had studied how a constant strain gradient in the rotating crystal of a double - crystal diffractometer affects the instrument operation .",
    "the result of that investigation was that the position of the bragg peaks depends only on the diffracting - plane spacing on the crystal entrance - surface .",
    "however , to simplify the problem , we had then assumed all the crystal surfaces rigorously flat . since subsequent experiments , using cylindrically bent crystals and both x- and @xmath0-rays to test that rather surprising result , delivered contradictory results still under examination ( kessler 2007 , massa _ et al . _ , 2005 ) , we were urged to investigate propagation in bent crystals in more detail .",
    "an additional reason was the interest in efficient laue - laue bent crystal diffractometers for @xmath0-ray spectroscopy of nuclei having a very high thermal neutron cross - section ( materna _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) .    for these reasons , we extend here our previous analysis by taking account of the curvature of the crystal surfaces and by simulating diffraction in both the non - dispersive and dispersive setups . in section [ t - t ]",
    "we solve , by the riemann - green method in cartesian coordinates , the takagi - taupin equations for the propagation of x- and @xmath0-rays in bent crystals ; we indicate also how the crystal surfaces are modelled , what choice of the reference perfect - crystal we have adopted and what kinds of distortion of the cylindrically bent crystal we have considered .",
    "sections [ flat ] and [ curved ] deal with two cases when the crystal surfaces , on which the initial conditions have to be assigned , are flat or cylindrical , respectively .",
    "while in the first case the solutions are known ( authier & simon 1968 , mana & palmisano 2004 ) , and are re - examined here to illustrate our formalism , we are not aware of solutions when the crystal surface is a cylinder .",
    "in fact , in the literature , the case of a curved crystal surface in the macroscopic sense is just hinted in takagi ( 1969 ) by means of a curvilinear coordinates .",
    "subsequently , olekhnovitch & olekhnovitch ( 1980 ) carried out the calculation of the profile function of the scattering curve for a crystal in the form of a cylinder the size of which does not exceed the extinction length .",
    "later , thorkildsen & larsen ( 1998 ) observed that it is in principle possible to obtain analytical expressions for the primary extinction factor in perfect crystals having a circular diffraction plane . in section",
    "[ double ] we apply our results to a double diffractometer and , to corroborate them , in section [ num - sim ] we solve numerically the takagi - taupin equations in polar coordinates for different geometrical and physical parameters .",
    "in order to study x - ray propagation through a distorted crystal , we shall apply the takagi - taupin equations ( takagi 1962 , takagi 1969 , taupin 1964 , autier 2001 , mana & montanari 2004 ) in the two - wave approximation of the dynamical theory of x - ray diffraction .",
    "since only cylindrical geometries will be considered , we shall use a two - dimension model with a reference frame having the @xmath1 and @xmath2 axes lying in the reflection plane .",
    "lattice distortion is described by the displacement field @xmath3 , which gives the difference between the actual distorted lattice and a virtual perfect - lattice identified by the reciprocal vector @xmath4 , which will be chosen according to our convenience .",
    "hence , we anchor the reference frame to it and set the @xmath1 axis parallel or antiparallel to @xmath4 . by using directional derivatives ,",
    "the takagi - taupin equations can be written as    @xmath5    in equations ( [ tdor ] ) and ( [ tdhr ] ) , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are slowly varying amplitudes of the ewald expansion    @xmath8 } \\label{decomp}\\ ] ]    of the dielectric displacement vector @xmath9 for the @xmath10 polarization ,    @xmath11    are the unit propagation vectors , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath15 is the modulus of the wave number vector of the incoming radiation ( with frequency @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 is the bragg angle ( with a sign ) , and the complex parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the fourier components of electric susceptibility ; in our case @xmath21 . we shall consider an infinite crystal slab the surfaces of which are smooth curves , @xmath22 \\rightarrow \\mathbf{r^2}$ ] and @xmath23 \\rightarrow \\mathbf{r^2}$ ] , with @xmath24 and @xmath250,1/\\tan\\theta_\\mathrm{b}[$ ] , where the last constraint is necessary to have a well - posed problem . by imposing that at each point of the entrance surface the o - component of the ewald expansion ( [ decomp ] ) is equal to the incoming wave @xmath26 , the initial conditions to solve equations ( [ tdor ] , [ tdhr ] ) are therefore    @xmath27    where @xmath28 $ ]",

    "let us now exemplify how cylindrical surfaces are modelled .",
    "the curvature centre can be located either on the source side or on the opposite , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 denoting the crystal thickness ) being the curvature radii of the entrance surface , respectively .",
    "a crystals having cylindrical surfaces will be called concave when its concavity is towards the source , convex otherwise .    in the concave case , by locating the reference - frame origin at the curvature centre , the parametric components of the surfaces are @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "the inward and outward normals to the entrance and exit surfaces , respectively , are @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the convex case , by locating the reference - frame origin again at the curvature centre , the surface components and their inward and outward normals are @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    and @xmath47      with a rotated crystal , since the reference perfect - lattice can be chosen at our convenience , we make the virtual lattice immovable , no matter what the crystal rotation might be ; consequently , a rotation is nothing that a very special kind of distortion .",
    "hence , our _ anstze _ to study x - ray propagation in a rotated crystal are : firstly , @xmath4 is independent of rotations , secondly , the first - order rotation term @xmath48 { \\bf \\hat{x } } \\approx \\alpha z { \\bf \\hat{x } } ,   \\label{urotcar}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the rotation angle ( clockwise oriented ) , must be added to the crystal distortion and , thirdly , the crystal surfaces must be mapped into the new lines @xmath50 and @xmath51 . as long as @xmath52 , we shall consider @xmath53 and @xmath54 , so that the crystal surfaces are left unchanged by rotations .",
    "we shall consider two distortions describing cylindrically bent crystals ; both , fan - down ,    @xmath55    and fan - up , @xmath56    are pure displacements in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "we have chosen the @xmath1 axis origin and the reference perfect - lattice so that , for the non - rotated crystal , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the local reciprocal vector of the distorted lattice . in equation ( [ ucard ] ) , the displacement is such that all the lattice planes are directed towards a point at distance @xmath35 from the entrance surface and the points at @xmath60 are undisplaced ( left upper part of fig .

    "additionally , the figures exemplify that peak shifts and , consequently , @xmath156 , are independent of the surface geometry ( flat or cylindrical , concave or convex ) , but they depend only on the entrance - surface strain @xmath167 .",
    "this confirms that the flat - surface approximation used in mana _",
    "et al . _  ( 2004 ) was admissible .",
    "to check further our numerical computations , we examined also two auxiliary cases , when the bragg planes are simply either contracted or expanded and when the bragg planes are not distorted .",
    "we have also carried out many numerical simulations with different entrance - slit apertures ; the above conclusion were always confirmed .",
    "we have studied x- and @xmath0-ray propagation in flat and cylindrically bent crystals .",
    "we have used the relevant results to describe the operation of a laue - laue diffractometer consisting of a flat collimating crystal and a bent analyzer crystal and we have extended the results of a previous investigation of ours ( mana _ et al . , _ 2004 ) .",
    "we have described the distortion charaterized by a constant strain gradient in crystals having flat or cylindrical surfaces .    in both cases , in addition to numerical simulations , we have also given exact solutions of the takagi - taupin equations in the form of riemann - green integrals .",
    "we have confirmed both analytical and numerical results that the rocking curve shift does not depend on the shape of the analyzer surface , but only on the lattice strain on the entrance surface .    since the validity of these solutions  via convolution integrals  is not limited to flat and cylindrical surfaces , we can extend such solutions either to the case when also the collimating crystal is cylindrically bent , or to the case when the effect of the surface roughness in x- and @xmath0-ray diffractometry and interferometry is not negligible .",
    "additionally , numerical simulations open the way to a better understanding of the operation of bent - crystal diffractometers , in particular when finite element solutions of the elasticity equations are integrated into the takagi - taupin equations thus allowing us to characterize the relevant lattice strains of the diffractometer crystals .",
