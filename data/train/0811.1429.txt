    "@xmath0 decays provide a clean laboratory for studying both the charged leptonic and hadronic weak currents .",
    "the weak interaction coupling strength between the first and second quark generations are probed with improved precision in hadronic decays having net strangeness of unity in the final state using @xmath8data collected by the  detector at the pep ii b - factory at slac at a center - of - mass energy near 10.58@xmath9 .",
    "the contribution due to second class current in @xmath7 decays are also probed with an order of magnitude improvement in the upper limit .",
    "tau decays into a single charged particle and neutrino(s ) can be used to test the assumption that all the three leptons have equal coupling strength ( @xmath10 to the charged gauge bosons of the electro - weak interaction , known as charged current lepton universality  @xcite .",
    "while a precise measurement of the ratio @xmath11 tests @xmath12e charged current lepton universality , the ratio @xmath13 tests @xmath14 charged current lepton universality with light mesons .",
    "similarly , a precise measurement of the ratio @xmath15 tests @xmath14 universality with strange mesons .    the largest off - diagonal element , , of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix  @xcite can be measured from the ratio of strange to non - strange inclusive branching fractions of the lepton , interpreted in the framework of the operator product expansion ( ope ) and finite energy sum rules ( fesr )  @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath16 also provides an alternate measurement of from @xmath0 decays , which is independent of the convergence of the ope .",

    "these contributions can be studied using the distribution ( @xmath115 ) of the angle @xmath116 between the normal to the @xmath117 decay plane and the direction of the remaining @xmath118 in a @xmath7 decay measured in the @xmath117 rest frame .",
    "while the fcc contribution is @xmath119 , the scc contributions are : @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , labeled using the orbital ( @xmath123 ) and total ( @xmath124 ) angular momenta quantum numbers .    after subtracting background events and applying efficiency corrections , a binned fit to the measured @xmath125 distribution",

    "no evidence for scc is observed , and a 90% confidence level bayesian upper limit for the ratio of scc to fcc in @xmath7 decays is set at 0.69% , which an order of magnitude improvement over the previous best upper limit of 5.4%  @xcite .",
