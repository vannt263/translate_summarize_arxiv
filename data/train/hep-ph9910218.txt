    "the investigation of the exclusive semileptonic decays of heavy hadrons , driven by the elementary process @xmath8 , can provide relevant information on fundamental parameters of the standard model ( @xmath9 ) , like e.g. the quark masses and the weak mixing angle @xmath10 , as well as on possible extensions of the @xmath9 . in this contribution",
    "we present the main results of an analysis of the decay @xmath11 performed recently in refs .",
    "@xcite adopting a relativistic quark model formulated on the light - front , and we illustrate also the possibility to extract relevant information on hadronic right - handed currents from the @xmath12 process .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the isgur - wise ( @xmath13 ) form factor relevant for the @xmath14 decay has been calculated in the whole accessible kinematical range adopting a light - front constituent quark model and using various forms of the three - quark wave function .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath13 form factor is sensitive to relativistic delocalization effects associated to the light - quark degrees of freedom , leading to a saturation property of the @xmath13 form factor as a function of the canonical baryon size .",
    "moreover , the shape of the @xmath13 function is found to be significantly affected by the baryon structure , being sharply different in case of diquark - like or collinear - type configurations .",
    "the comparison with recent lattice @xmath1 calculations @xcite as well as with the ( model - dependent ) dispersive bounds of ref .",
    "@xcite suggests clearly the dominance of collinear - type configurations with respect to diquark - like ones , and allows to put effective _ constraints _ on the shape of the @xmath13 function in the full recoil range relevant for the @xmath14 decay ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "the @xmath14 decay has been investigated within the framework of the @xmath9 including radiative as well as first - order @xmath15 corrections to the relevant form factors , as derived in ref .",
    "our final predictions for the exclusive semileptonic branching ratio , the longitudinal and transverse asymmetries , and the longitudinal to transverse decay ratio are : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . our results for the partially - integrated exclusive semileptonic branching ratio are reported in fig . 1 and compared with the corresponding results from the lattice @xmath1 simulations of ref .",
    "it can be seen that our results are always well within the range of values given by the lattice @xmath1 simulations and that radiative plus first - order power corrections modify only slightly the results obtained within the heavy quark symmetry ( @xmath20 ) . if the integration over the recoil is limited to @xmath21 , then the resulting uncertainty on the branching ratio reduces significantly to @xmath22 , though at the price of reducing the number of the events by a factor @xmath23 ( see table 2 of ref .",
    "this implies the possibility to extract the @xmath24 matrix elements @xmath25 with a theoretical uncertainty of @xmath26 , which is comparable with present uncertainties obtained from exclusive semileptonic @xmath27-meson decays @xcite .",
    "@xmath28     in ref .",
    "@xcite various partially - integrated asymmetries have been investigated , showing that in comparing with ( future ) data the precise @xmath29-range of the experiments has to be taken into account .",
    "it turns out that radiative plus first - order @xmath15 corrections are relevant for the transverse asymmetry @xmath30 and for the longitudinal @xmath31 polarization @xmath32 , whereas both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are only marginally affected by such @xmath20 corrections , as it is clearly shown in fig .",
    "moreover , the model dependence on the various asymmetries is generally quite limited and , in particular , our uncertainty on @xmath7 , which is always much less than the one presently achievable by lattice @xmath1 calculations , reduces to @xmath33 when the integration over the recoil is limited to @xmath21 .    figure 2 .",
    "partially - integrated longitudinal asymmetry @xmath6 ( a ) and longitudinal to transverse decay ratio @xmath7 ( d ) versus the upper limit of integration over the recoil , @xmath34 , for the decay process @xmath14 .",
    "the dotted and solid lines correspond to the @xmath20 results and to those obtained including radiative plus first - order @xmath15 corrections , respectively .",
    "the meaning of the lower and upper lines , as well as of the vertical dot - dashed line , is as in fig .",

    "the small uncertainties found for the longitudinal asymmetry @xmath6 and the longitudinal to transverse decay ratio @xmath7 make the experimental determination of these quantities a very interesting tool for testing the @xmath9 and investigating possible new physics ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "we now illustrate the sensitivity of @xmath6 and @xmath7 to the introduction of possible hadronic right - handed currents by considering the presence in the effective weak hamiltonian of both left - handed ( @xmath36 ) and right - handed ( @xmath37 ) operators , viz .",
    "@xmath38 , where @xmath39 , with the values of the coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 depending on the specific @xmath35 model . in general @xmath42 , but in what follows we consider for simplicity @xmath43 , and we introduce two parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , defined as @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which are clearly connected to the relative strength and phase of @xmath37 currents with respect to @xmath36 ones .",

    "are summarized in fig .",
    "it can be clearly seen that both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are significantly sensitive to the presence of @xmath37 currents , but their determination allows the extraction of information both on the strength and phase of @xmath37 currents .",
