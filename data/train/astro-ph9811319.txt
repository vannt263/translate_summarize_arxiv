    "nuclear disks of ionized gas , a few @xmath10 pc in diameter , provide an efficient and powerful alternative to stellar dynamical studies in constraining the central potential of early type galaxies ( ferrarese , ford & jaffe 1996 , harms et al .",
    "1994 , bower et al .",
    "1998 , van der marel & van den bosch 1998 ) . since the seminal papers by sargent et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and young et al .",
    "( 1978 ) dynamical modeling of the stellar kinematics has been the tool of choice in searching for massive black holes ( bh ) . however , the method is complicated since the stellar orbital structure is unknown and difficult to derive from the observational data ( intensity , velocity and velocity dispersion ) because of line@xmath5of@xmath5sight projections .",
    "more seriously , the well known degeneracy between velocity anisotropy and varying mass@xmath5to@xmath5light ratio undermines the hope of nailing down the presence of a massive bh , at least in the brightest , pressure supported ellipticals ( sargent et al .",
    "1978 , richstone & tremaine 1985 , van der marel 1994 ) .",
    "a new chapter in the search for massive bh was written when the wide field and planetary camera on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) was pointed at ngc 4261 , a giant elliptical galaxy and powerful radio source 30 mpc away .",
    "the images showed a regular , flattened disk of dust and gas , 230 pc in diameter ( jaffe et al .",
    "1993 ) : even if the gas can easily be perturbed by non gravitational forces ( shocks , radiation pressure , winds , magnetic fields ; fillmore , boronson & dressler 1986 ) , the regular and flattened structure of the disk implies that circular motion in the central potential of the galaxy should dominate the velocity field .",
    "compared to the stellar system , the disk is two@xmath5dimensional , so that complications connected to the projection of the orbital velocities are not an issue , nor are ambiguities associated with the presence of velocity anisotropy . finally , the bright emission lines from the disk are easy to detect .",
    "these promises were fulfilled when harms et al .",
    "( 1994 ) used the hst / faint object spectrograph ( fos ) to find that the disk of ionized gas discovered in the virgo cd galaxy m87 ( ford et al .",
    "1994 ) , is indeed in keplerian motion around a @xmath11  central mass , a result confirmed by later observations with higher spatial resolution ( macchetto et al .",
    "1997 , ford & tsvetanov 1998 ) .",
    "the astonishingly high @xmath12 of @xmath13 / _  within the inner 6 pc lead ford & tsvetanov to conclude that the central mass must be in the form of a bh .",
    "spectroscopic data for ngc 4261 ( ferrarese et al .",
    "1996 ) also point to a keplerian velocity field and a @xmath14  central mass , likely a bh given the high value @xmath12 of @xmath15 / _   within 15 pc .",
    "since then , two more bhs have been discovered using hst kinematics of ionized gas disks .",

    "this paper discusses hst images and spectra of the giant elliptical ngc 6251 , host of one of the most spectacular radio sources in the sky ( waggett , warner , & baldwin 1977 ) . at a distance of 106 mpc ( for h@xmath18",
    "= 70  mpc@xmath1 ) , this is the farthest galaxy for which the presence of a massive bh has been investigated .",
    "oneil et al .",
    "( 1994 ) discovered a small ( @xmath19 14 in diameter ) disk of dust in the central region of ngc 6251 .",
    "interestingly , ngc 6251 is one of the first galaxies ( with m87 ) for which the presence of a nuclear black hole was claimed , 20 years ago , by peter young and his collaborators ( young et al . 1979 ) , based on the steepening of the surface brightness profile towards the center .",
    "the study of the kinematics of the ionized gas associated with the dust disk allows us to check the black hole claim .",
    "ngc 6251 is an e2 galaxy with m@xmath2013.6 mag ( rc3 , de vaucouleurs et al .",

    "waggett et al .",
    "( 1977 ) identified it as the parent galaxy of one of the largest radio sources in the sky : the radio lobes , which show the marked s@xmath5shape geometry expected as the result of precession of the feeding jet , extend for 12 in the plane of the sky ( over 2 mpc projected ) .",
    "the northwest lobe is connected to the small diameter radio core by a bright , well collimated radio jet extending for 44 ( 130 kpc ) .",
    "the kpc radio structure was studied by owen & laing ( 1989 ) , jones et al .",

    "different models to the velocity pattern of the emission line gas are discussed in  4 , and compared in  4.1 , where we conclude that the best fitting models imply the presence of a @xmath22  central mass , probably a black hole in view of the presence of an active nucleus .",

    "a summary is drawn in  6 .",
    "narrow band and continuum images of ngc 6251 were obtained on 1996 september 13 with the hst / wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 , biretta et al .",
    "the f673n filter ( central wavelength @xmath23=6732 , fwhm @xmath24= 47 ) was used to map the + [ nii ] emission line region , while the f547 m ( @xmath23=5476 , @xmath24= 483 ) and f814w ( @xmath23=7921 , @xmath24= 1488 ) filters covered the emission@xmath5line free continuum on both sides of the + [ nii ] emission .",
    "the galaxy nucleus was placed on the 800@xmath25800 pixel planetary camera ( pc ) chip , the highest resolution of the four wfpc2 ccds : at a 0.046 arcsec / pix scale , each pc pixel covers 24 parsecs at the distance of ngc 6251 . the gain and read out noise of the camera are 7 e@xmath26/dn and 7 @xmath27 respectively .",
    "the total exposure times of the observations are 1400 s in f547 m , 1000 s in f814w , and 5700 s in f673n . to facilitate cosmic ray removal",
    ", the continuum and narrow band images were broken into two and four consecutive exposures respectively .",
    "routine calibration was performed by the standard hst pipeline and consisted of correction of small a / d errors , subtraction of a bias level for each chip , subtraction of a super@xmath5bias frame , subtraction of a dark frame , correction for shutter shading effects , and division by a flat field ( see holtzman et al .",
    "1995a for a detailed discussion ) . based on the centroids of fifteen point sources present in the field of view , back to back images taken with the same filter",
    "are registered to within 0.02 pixels . in averaging back to back images ,",
    "pixels deviating more than three times the local sigma calculated from the combined effects of poisson statistic and read out noise , were identified as cosmic rays , and replaced with the lowest of the input values .",
    "images taken with different filters are shifted by up to one pixel with respect to each other , and were aligned by performing a bilinear interpolation in both x and y directions .",
    "the calibrated , combined , and cosmic ray cleaned f547 m , f673n and f814w images are shown in figure 1 , and will be discussed in  2.2 .",
    "the f547 m image is also shown in figure 2 .",
    "photometric calibration was performed as outlined by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995b ) .",
    "f547 m and f814w counts were transformed to @xmath2 and @xmath3 magnitudes respectively , and f673n counts to fluxes .",
    "the accuracy of the photometric zero points is 0.1 mag in @xmath2 and @xmath3 and 5% in the f673n fluxes .",
    "as further processing , we derived the isophotal parameters , the reddening map and the pure emission line map as follows .",
    "isophotal parameters ( position angle , center , ellipticity and fourier coefficients ) were derived using the iraf task ellipse , and are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the right ascension , declination and position angle of the isophotes , averaged between 15 and 4 , can be found in table 1 .",
    "the same table lists the coordinates of the nucleus , calculated as the flux centroid within a three pixel radius aperture .",
    "figure 4 shows the @xmath2 brightness profile and @xmath28 color profile , both integrated along the galaxy isophotes , as a function of the isophotal semi@xmath5major axis .",
    "a reddening map was derived from the @xmath2 and @xmath3 images , in the assumption that the reddening law follows cardelli , clayton and mathis ( 1989 ) , that @xmath29 , and that there is no discontinuity in the ( de@xmath5reddened ) @xmath28 color of the stellar population across the boundary of the dust region .",
    "figure 4 shows that the @xmath28 color increases towards the center by about 0.01 mag / arcsec between 2  and 6 .",
    "the same trend was assumed within the dusty regions in calculating the reddening map . finally ,",
    "since the nucleus and stellar population have different colors , the nucleus was removed prior to calculating the reddening map , as described below .",
    "the tinytim software ( krist 1995 ) was used to construct theoretical pc psfs for each filter and with the appropriate amount of telescope jitter ( jitter information is recorded by the on@xmath5board telemetry and was never larger than 7 mas for our observations ) . since the pc psf is under@xmath5sampled ( the fwhm is of the order 1.5 pixels ) , the observed count distribution is critically dependent on the psf center within a pixel . to avoid sub@xmath5pixel interpolation in matching the data ,",
    "the theoretical tinytim psf was sub@xmath5sampled by a factor ten , matched to the data and then re@xmath5binned .",
    "this produces fits accurate to 0.1 pixels .    a contour plot of the @xmath2 absorption @xmath30 , assuming that only half of the starlight is attenuated by dust , is over@xmath5plotted on the f547 m image in figure 5 .",
    "for a typical dust to gas ratio and dust properties , the average optical extinction in the disk , @xmath31 mag , is in excellent agreement with the neutral hydrogen column density derived by birkinshaw & worrall from rosat data .",
    "the reddening map , adequately scaled to account for differential dust absorption , was used to de@xmath5redden the f547 m , f673n and f814w images .",
    "the major and minor axes profiles in the central three arcsec before and after reddening correction are shown in figure 6 .",
    "finally , a map of the line emitting region was obtained .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 extinction corrected images were averaged and scaled so to match the median counts of the on@xmath5band f673n image in a circular annulus between 15 and 40 from the nucleus .",
    "the resulting continuum image was then subtracted from the on@xmath5band image to produce the emission line map shown in figure 1 .",
    "the most striking feature unveiled by the wfpc2 images shown in figure 1 is certainly the well defined nuclear dust structure , strongly reminiscent of the dust disk seen in ngc 4261 ( jaffe et al .",
    "1993 , ferrarese , ford & jaffe 1996 ) .",
    "the major and minor axis of the structure extend for 143 ( 730 pc ) and 034 ( 170 pc ) respectively : their ratio implies an angle of 76  between the normal to the disk and the line of sight , assuming the dust is distributed in a thin circular disk .    as is the case for the ngc 4261 dust disk , the ngc 6251 disk is not perfectly uniform nor symmetric .",
    "this was already noted by crane and vernet ( 1997 ) , who further mention the possibility that the disk is warped .",
    "the north tip of the disk bends slightly to the east .",
    "the west side is brighter than the east side , which is easily interpreted as an inclination effect : since the line of sight to the far side of the disk encounters more un@xmath5obstructed stars , that side will appear brighter . within the errors ,",
    "the position of the nucleus coincides with the isophotal center of the galaxy and with the radio core as measured by jones & wehrle ( 1994 , precessed to j2000 ) , but the disk is shifted slightly to the north with respect to the stellar isophotes .",
    "also , the disk and the galaxy isophotes are not coaxial , and the disk minor axis is not aligned with the parsec scale radio jet .",
    "quantitatively , the misalignment between the major axes of the disk and the stellar isophotes is 167@xmath3224 , while the minor axis of the disk and the radio jet are misaligned by 231@xmath3224 .",
    "this last observation is of particular interest , since it implies that the jet is not perpendicular to the plane defined by the edge of the disk .",
    "if the jet is accelerated and collimated by an accretion disk threaded by a large scale , perpendicular magnetic field ( e.g. blandford 1993 ) , then the non perpendicularity between the jet and the dust disk implies that either the disk is severely warped , or that there is no continuity between the 100@xmath5pc scale dust disk and the sub@xmath5parsec scale inner accretion disk .",
    "figure 2 shows the best fitting elliptical contour to the edge of the disk , and the directions of the isophotal axes , of the parsec scale radio jet ( from jones et al .",
    "1986 , precessed to the epoch of the wfpc2 observations , 1996.7 ) and of the acceptable range for the stellar rotation axis ( from heckman et al . 1985 ,",
    "precessed to 1996.7 ) .",
    "all position angles and coordinates are also summarized in table 1 .",
    "the dust mass in the disk is estimated as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the surface area of the disk and the visual mass absorption coefficient is @xmath35 mag @xmath36 g@xmath1 ( sadler & gerhard 1985 ) .",
    "the mean @xmath30 in the disk , @xmath37 mag , corresponds to @xmath38 mag for @xmath39 , giving a total dust mass @xmath40 . for a galactic gas to dust ratio , @xmath41 ,",
    "the total mass in the disk is @xmath42 .",
    "the nuclear emission , probably of non@xmath5thermal origin , is unresolved in all images , while the + [ nii ] emitting region ( figure 1 ) is clearly extended .",
    "this is shown in figures 7a - c , which plot the radial profiles of the nucleus and the ionized gas region ( after continuum subtraction , ",
    "2.1 ) , compared to the best matching psf radial profile .",
    "the reddening@xmath5uncorrected magnitudes of the nucleus are @xmath43 mag and @xmath44 mag .",
    "to derive reddening corrected magnitudes , we need to add the foreground ( galactic ) extinction to the mean internal extinction in the disk ( @xmath45 mag ) .",
    "according to schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) the foreground reddening in the direction of ngc 6251 is @xmath46 mag ( note that this agrees with the burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) value of @xmath47 mag ) , or @xmath48 mag for @xmath39 .",
    "therefore the total extinction to the nucleus of ngc 6251 is @xmath49 mag , and the un@xmath5reddened magnitudes of the nucleus are @xmath50 mag and @xmath51 mag .",
    "the + [ nii ] flux is @xmath52 erg @xmath53 s@xmath1 , corresponding to a line luminosity of @xmath54 erg s@xmath1 at a distance of 106 mpc .",
    "this is comparable to the line luminosity of the gas disk in ngc 4261 ( ferrarese et al .",
    "it is also typical of agns with similar radio luminosity ( baum & heckman 1989 ) .",
    "thirteen spectra covering the central 03 of ngc 6251 were obtained on 1997 january 11 using the hst / fos ( keyes et al .",
    "1995 ) . the @xmath55pair@xmath5b square aperture , with projected dimensions on the sky 009 @xmath25 009 ( corresponding to @xmath56 parsecs at the distance of ngc 6251 ) , was used to map a 3@xmath253 grid , including the nucleus and aligned with the major axis of the dust disk ( position angle 4 ) .",
    "four additional spectra were obtained 018 on either side of the center of the 3@xmath253 grid , along the major and minor axes of the dust disk .",
    "the position of the apertures with respect to nucleus are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the nucleus was acquired through a 4@xmath5stage peak@xmath5up ( keyes et al .",
    "1995 ) , using sequentially the 10@xmath5pair , 05@xmath5pair , 025@xmath5pair and 01@xmath5pair apertures . while the original intent was to place the center of the aperture grid on the nucleus , analysis of the map formed by the peak@xmath5up steps and dwells shows that the acquisition procedure was only partially successful , and that the center of the grid is offset by 005 to the north and 002 to the west with respect to the nucleus , due to malfunctioning of the on@xmath5board acquisition software . in the remainder of this paper the aperture positions will be referred to as labeled in figure 2 .",
    "the grating used , g780h , covers the wavelength region between 6270  and 8500 . a spectral resolution of 4.85 @xmath32 0.02  was derived from the average fwhm of sixteen emission lines in seven wavelength calibration spectra taken during the observing sequence .",
    "all spectra are quarter@xmath5stepped , a procedure in which the spectrum is stepped onto the linear array of 512 diodes by one@xmath5quarter of the diode width ( 1.43 ) along the dispersion direction .",
    "all exposure times should have been 2050 seconds ; in practice , to maximize telescope efficiency , positions 3 and e were exposed for 1950 s , positions n and nuc were exposed for 2060 s and position w for 2460 s.    the spectra were calibrated by the standard hst pipeline as described by keyes et al .",
    "the calibration includes paired@xmath5pulse correction , background and scattered light subtractions , and flat fielding . in order to achieve a higher accuracy in the wavelength scale than allowed by the standard processing , we observed arc lamp spectra either immediately before or after each science spectrum . for each arc lamp spectrum ,",
    "dispersion coefficients were computed following the procedure outlined by kriss ( 1994 ) .",
    "the dispersion coefficients assigned to each science spectrum are the mean of the coefficients of the two arc spectra immediately preceding and following it , weighted by the time lapsed between the middle of the science exposure and the arc spectra . according to a convention adopted for the fos , all wavelengths are vacuum wavelengths .",
    "the largest zero point difference between arc lamp spectra is 0.45 , corresponding to 20  at 7000 .",
    "this defines the accuracy of our wavelength scale , and is consistent with the fos wavelength accuracy limit reported by keyes et al .",
    "however , there is a 2.3  shift between the standard ( pipeline processing ) wavelength zero point and the average of the zero points derived from our arc lamps .",
    "this is likely due to the non@xmath5repeatability in the position of the filter@xmath5grating wheel ( estimated to be 0.35 diodes , keyes et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "inverse sensitivity curves are not available for the 01 aperture , therefore flux calibration is not performed by the pipeline processing .",
    "rough fluxes for the 01 aperture are obtained by using the inverse sensitivity curve for the 025 fos square aperture , multiplied by the ratio of the throughputs of the two apertures ( 0.47 , keyes et al .",
    "since this ratio is calculated for point sources , it can be off by as much as a factor @xmath57 ( the ratio of the sky projected areas of the two apertures ) in the extreme case of a source with uniform surface brightness .",
    "in addition , even for point sources , the throughput ratio is strongly dependent ( varying by up to 50% ) on the centering of the source within the aperture . for these reasons ,",
    "all absolute fluxes reported in this paper should be used with extreme caution . however , relative fluxes are correct to within a few percent .      the hst / fos spectra described in  3.1 provide an almost complete coverage of the emitting line region shown in figure 1 .",
    "the nuclear spectrum is plotted in figure 8 .",
    "emission lines of [ oi]6300,6364 , , [ nii]6548,6584 , [ sii]6717,6731 and [ oii]7325 are detected .",
    "as for ngc 4261 ( ferrarese , ford , & jaffe 1996 ) , which also hosts a very well defined dust disk , the [ nii]+  complex has broad wings superimposed on narrower lines , and the [ nii ] lines are strong compared to . as discussed in more detail in the next section , the heavy blending of the  and [ nii ] lines and the presence of the broad wings make estimating accurate line fluxes rather difficult .",
    "in addition , important diagnostic lines , such as [ oiii]5007 and h@xmath58 , fall outside the wavelength coverage of the spectra .",
    "however , given the ( admittedly not ideal ) [ sii]6717,6731/ , [ oii]7325/   and [ nii]6584/  line ratios derived in  3.2.1 , the diagnostic plot of dopita & southerland ( 1995 ) show that ngc 6251 lies near the upper limit of the region defined by liners and well outside the region populated by seyfert galaxies , pointing to shocks as the likely cause of ionization for the gas ( contini 1997 , dopita & southerland 1995 , allen , dopita , & tsvetanov 1998 ) .",
    "the aim of the fos observations is to obtain a high spatial resolution map of the velocity field in the central region , to constrain the central potential .",
    "to achieve this , accurate fitting of the emission lines is necessary .",
    "because of the target mis@xmath5centering (  3.1 ) and the rapid decrease in the + [ nii ] surface brightness with radius , we can not successfully measure emission lines from the six apertures which are not adjacent to the nucleus .",
    "the [ nii]+  complex is detected at 1.5@xmath59 at positions 2 , 10 and 11 , and 2@xmath59 at positions 3 and 4 , but due to the low s / n and the low resolution of the spectra , none of the lines can be accurately measured .",
    "the spectra at the remaining seven aperture positions which will be used in the dynamical modeling are shown in figure 9 .",
    "the line synthesis program specfit ( kriss 1994 ) is used to fit the spectra .",
    "emission lines are modeled with a gaussian with four degrees of freedom : flux , centroid , fwhm and a skew parameter .",
    "the continuum is approximated with a power law , described by two free parameters ( slope and flux at a specified wavelength ) .",
    "fitting is done interactively via chi@xmath5square minimization using a marquardt algorithm . in the fit",
    ", the ratio of the central wavelengths of lines in doublets ( [ oi ] , [ nii ] and [ sii ] ) , is constrained to be equal to the ratio of the corresponding rest vacuum wavelengths .",
    "also , the fwhms of lines in doublets are set equal .",
    "because of the relative low spectral resolution of our data , the + [ nii ] complex is not fully resolved , and in order to constrain the fit , we fixed the redshift and fwhm of the  and [ nii ] lines to be the same . because of the limited s / n in the [ oi ] and [ sii ] lines , the shape parameter for all lines is set equal to the shape parameter of [ nii]6584 .",
    "finally , the [ nii]6584/[nii]6548 flux ratio is fixed to the theoretical value of three .",
    "these constraints bring the number of free parameters for the seven emission lines plus the continuum down from 30 to 15 .",
    "figure 10a shows the best fit to the nuclear spectrum obtained under the assumptions listed above .",
    "the broad wings in the [ nii]+  complex are not reproduced by the model . to obtain a better fit",
    ", we added a broad  component to the model with all four parameters set free , therefore increasing the total number of parameters to 19 .",
    "the best fit under these conditions is shown in figure 10b , and is a clear improvement over our previous attempt .",
    "quantitatively , the reduced @xmath60 for the first model ( without broad ) is 1.92 , while the introduction of the broad  line brings @xmath60 down to 1.41 .",
    "the parameters of the fit are listed in table 2 . within the errors ,",
    "all narrow lines have the same redshift , which is however @xmath61  lower than the systemic velocity of the galaxy , @xmath21  ( huchra et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the broad  line is very asymmetric , with a steep blue side and a more gradually declining and more extended red side .",
    "in contrast , no significant asymmetry is seen in the narrow emission lines .",
    "the peak of the broad  line is blueshifted by 870  ( @xmath62 ) with respect to the narrow , however , because of the marked asymmetry , the midpoint of the line at half intensity is redshifted by @xmath19850  from the frame of the narrow lines .",
    "there are several possibilities for the origin of the broad   component .",
    "chen & halpern ( 1989 ) and chen , halpern , & filippenko ( 1989 ) studied the emission profiles generated by a relativistic keplerian accretion disk around a supermassive black hole .",
    "their models predict that the line profile will split into a double@xmath5peaked structure due to rotation , that the blue peak will be stronger than the red peak due to relativistic beaming , and that there will be a net gravitational redshift of the line profile .",
    "a sample of 12 radio galaxies with broad emission lines which can be reproduced in the keplerian disk framework is discussed by eracleous & halpern ( 1994 ) .",
    "the fractional redshift measured for ngc 6251 is comparable to the mean shift observed for the eracleous & halpern sample , but the fwhm of the ngc 6251 broad line ( @xmath63 ) is smaller than observed for typical disk@xmath5like emitters ( @xmath64  with the distribution peaking at @xmath65 ) .",
    "alternative mechanisms leading to double peaked or asymmetric line profiles are biconical or spherical radial outflows ( zheng , sulentic , & binette 1990 , zheng , veilleux , & grandi 1991 ; see however livio & xu 1997 ) and massive binary black holes ( begelman , blandford , & rees , 1980 ) .",
    "higher spectral resolution and s / n data are necessary to perform detailed modeling and discriminate between the alternatives mentioned above .",
    "the fit to the n spectrum ( which has comparable s / n to the nuclear spectrum , and higher than any of the other spectra ) was carried out as described for the nucleus .",
    "we found that , while the central velocity for the narrow lines is significantly different from the nuclear values ( see table 2 ) , the fwhm , redshift and shape of the ( unconstrained ) broad  line are consistent with what measured at the nuclear location .",
    "this confirms the hypothesis that the broad  line originates from an unresolved region at the nuclear location , and what is seen in the off@xmath5nuclear spectra is due to the wings of the fos psf . for all remaining spectra , due to the considerable decrease in the s / n ratio , it was necessary to constrain the fit by fixing the central velocity , shape and fwhm ( but not the flux ) of the broad  line to the nuclear values .",
    "figure 11 shows the fits to all seven spectra ; the free parameters for each emission line are listed in table 2 .",
    "the fluxes of the broad  emission are found to decline with increasing distance from the nucleus in a fashion consistent , within the quoted errors , with what is expected for a point source centered at the northern edge of the nuc aperture , which coincides with the nuclear position (  3.1 ) .",
    "this section will make use of the gas velocities measured at the seven fos aperture locations discussed above to probe the presence of a central mass concentration .",
    "we will make the simple assumption that the velocity field is determined by the combined potentials of the stars and of the central black hole , and ignore , for the time being , the possible presence of radial flows , which will be discussed in  4.2 .",
    "we will further assume that the gas is confined in a thin disk .",

    "the procedure is non@xmath5unique since the presence of both the dust disks and the non@xmath5thermal nucleus prevents us from performing a complete isophotal analysis @xmath5 and therefore determining the surface brightness profile @xmath5 in the critical inner @xmath19 05 (  2.1 ) .",
    "figure 12 shows the best fits to the surface brightness profile between 05 and 35 , using two different analytical functions .",
    "the first , represented by the solid line , is the sum of two exponential functions of the type @xmath66 and , in the assumption of spherical symmetry , can be deprojected analytically to give the luminosity density plotted in the lower panel of figure 12 .",
    "the second fit to the surface brightness profile is performed using the hernquist model ( hernquist 1990 ) .",
    "the two functions give fits of similar quality , however , the extrapolated central brightness and luminosity density predicted by the hernquist model are a factor three and ten higher respectively than given by the double exponential profile .",
    "do the two fits described above give reasonable representations of the luminosity density for a galaxy like ngc 6251 ?",
    "it is now widely recognized that a well defined relationship exists between the central slope of the brightness profile and the absolute magnitude of the host galaxy ( e.g. ferrarese et al . 1994 ) . in particular , gebhardt et al .",

    "therefore , if we err in determining the central luminosity density and mass , we err on the safe side : our lower estimate on the central mass will indeed represent a hard lower limit .    before proceeding , we can provide a further check to the claim that the real brightness profile is within the limits set by the two fits shown in figure 12 , by pushing our measurement of the brightness profile closer to the nucleus using the dereddened images (  2.1 ) , or the brightness profile along the minor axis of the dust disk .",
    "note however , that neither method will allow us to bring our measurements inside the inner 02 , which are contaminated by the bright nucleus .",

    "a high degree of gas turbulence is testified by the large line widths , which are one order of magnitude larger than the ( presumably ) rotational velocities , implying that in spite of the fact that the outer dust disk appears fairly flat , the inner parts must be geometrically thick , and the possibility of radial flows can not be excluded .",

    "cooling flows have been advocated ( birkinshaw & worrall 1993 ) and a stable warped configuration for the dust / gas disk is possible in the presence of a tumbling triaxial potential .",
    "we also considered the role of radiation driven warping in shaping the disk , and concluded that it has a negligible effect , at least in the outer , dust dominated , regions .",
    "the models presented in this paper are based on seven emission lines .",
    "error@xmath5bars on the measured velocities are large , and constraining the model parameters is tricky .",
    "a total of fourteen orbits of hst time were spent in obtaining the ngc 6251 spectra , therefore higher quality data would be prohibitively expensive . at a distance of @xmath61 mpc ,",
    "ngc 6251 represents the limit to which the search for massive black holes could be pushed with the hst / fos : a second trip deep inside the ngc 6251 gas disk with hst / stis will undoubtedly enlighten the picture .",
