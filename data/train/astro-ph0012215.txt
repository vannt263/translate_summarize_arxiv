    "clusters of galaxies , the biggest collapsed mass aggregations in the present universe , are formed through the hierarchical process of gravitational infall , collision and merging of smaller groups and clusters and a subsequent relaxation of all the matter components in the cluster .",
    "each merger is a very energetic event .",
    "a large fraction of the kinetic energy of the collision goes into shock heating of the intracluster gas ( e.g. , schindler & mller 1993 ; roettiger et al .",
    "1993 and later works ) , a process that has great importance for cluster physics and that we can readily observe using the s combination of energy coverage and superb spatial resolution . here",
    "we present preliminary results from acis - i on four hot clusters , a665 , a2163 , a2218 , and a754 .",
    "x - ray images of all these clusters show structure of various degrees of complexity ; however , in the absence of the characteristic temperature signatures , it may be a result of projection rather than a merger .",
    "for a754 , unambiguous data existed before that it is a merger , from both the optical and x - ray temperature data ( zabludoff & zaritsky 1995 ; henry & briel 1995 ; henriksen & markevitch 1996 ) .",
    "for a2163 , some indication of a nonrelaxed state from the gas temperature and optical data existed ( markevitch et al .  1994 ; squires et al .",
    "1997 ) ; and for a2218 , weak lensing mass reconstruction suggested two mass concentrations ( kneib et al .",
    "1996 ) . for a665 ,",
    "there has been no suggestion of a nonrelaxed state other than an asymmetric x - ray image .",
    "a665 , a2218 and a2163 also are famous sz sources ( e.g. , birkinshaw et al.1991 , references therein and later works ) and detailed gas temperature maps are critical for correct interpretation of the sz data .",

    "1.projected radial temperature profiles of ( a ) a665 , ( b ) a2163 , ( c ) a2218 .",
    "the a665 and a2163 profiles are overlaid on the results from markevitch ( 1996 ) .",
    "a665 , a2163 and a2218 were observed by acis - i for short exposures of 9 ks , 10 ks , and 18 ks , respectively ( clean exposure after the rejection of background flares , if any ) , which is sufficient for derivation of crude temperature maps and radial temperature profiles .",
    "a754 was observed by acis - i for a clean exposure of 39 ks , sufficient for a detailed temperature map of the central @xmath3 region covered by acis - i .",
    "the acis gain tables , quantum efficiency curves and spectral response matrices latest as of september - october 2000 were used .",
    "the detector + sky background was estimated using the appropriate blank sky datasets , correcting for a slow secular decrease of the background rate ( markevitch 2000 ) .",
    "the background uncertainty of @xmath4% was included in quadrature to the statistical uncertainties of the temperature values ( it is significant for the radial profiles at high radii ) .",
    "point sources were excluded from the analysis , and the energy band of 0.89 kev ( or close ) was used .",
    "the cti - induced nonuniformity of the acis - i quantum efficiency was corrected using an approximate model function ( vikhlinin 2000 ) . for the a754 , a665 and a2218 observations made at the @xmath5c acis temperature ,",
    "this correction is important , while for a2163 observed later at @xmath6c , it is much less significant .",
    "we also used an additional experimental position - independent correction factor of @xmath7 for the acis - i quantum efficiency below @xmath8 kev to account for the difference between acis - s3 and acis - i observations of a calibration snr ( vikhlinin 2000 ) .",
    "for hot clusters , ignoring it results in spuriously high galactic absorption columns and temperatures and their dependence on the adopted lower energy cut .",
    "once these corrections were applied , all fits were acceptable and independent of the energy band used .",
    "the absorption column was fixed at the galactic values for a754 , a665 and a2218 , and at the  pspc value for a2163 ( which is higher than the galactic one , elbaz et al .",
    "1994 ) ; fitting it as a free parameter gave consistent values .",
    "temperatures for the radial profiles were fit using xspec , and two - dimensional temperature maps were derived from adaptively smoothed acis images in a number of narrow energy bands as described in markevitch et al .",
    "figure 1 presents radial temperature profiles for the three distant clusters , overlaid on the  projected profiles for a665 and a2163 from markevitch ( 1996 ) .",
    "the profiles for a2163 and a2218 show a radial decline  for a2163 , in good agreement with the  result from markevitch ( 1996 ) , and for a2218 , with that from white ( 2000 ) .",
    "the a665 profile is consistent with a constant temperature , although it does not cover the complete radial range of the  data .",
    "however , the a665 temperature map ( fig .",
    "2 ) shows that this cluster is in fact highly nonisothermal  there is a spectacular bow shock in front of what appears from the image to be a cooler cluster core moving from the nw direction with respect to the gas in the southern region .",
    "figure 3 shows a temperature map of a2163 .",
    "already the brightness contours of the acis image show that the cluster inner region is probably in a highly nonrelaxed state .",
    "the temperature map confirms that and reveals hot gas regions coincident with enhancements in the gas density that most plausibly are shocks or streams of shock - heated gas .",
    "the central region is cooler in projection , perhaps because the shocks have not penetrated the dense subcluster cores as they fell to the center , similarly to what we see in a2142 and a3667 ( markevitch et al .",
    "2000 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "2000 ) . temperature maps for a2163 and a665 and their relation to the radio data will be discussed in detail in the forthcoming paper .",
    "figure 4 shows a detailed temperature map for a754 . on a large scale , it is in good agreement with earlier results from henry & briel ( 1995 ) and henriksen & markevitch ( 1996 ) .",
    "the latter s  map had only @xmath9 pixels in the area shown in fig .",
    "4 . large hot area south and southwest of center and smaller hot regions elsewhere",
    "most plausibly result from shock heating .",
    "there is a curious low - temperature region at the tip of the elongated dense gas body ; it does not coincide with either the gas density peak or one of the two cd galaxies in this cluster .",
    "a close examination of the optical image reveals a possible small galaxy group at this position , and a simple estimate shows that the elongated body may in fact be a projection of two more round subclusters of different temperatures , making a754 a three - body merger .",
    "a more detailed discussion will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the results presented here are made possible by the successful effort of the entire  team to launch and operate the observatory .",
