    "the braneworld scenario , in which matter fields are confined on a brane in higher dimensional spacetime , has been one of the most exciting subjects in the research into the early universe . as the early universe is supposed to have experienced a rather high - energy epoch , studies of the dynamics of the early universe might reveal as yet undiscovered imprints of extra dimensions to us .    in our previous studies",
    "@xcite we considered a @xmath0-dimensional braneworld model with one or two @xmath1-branes .",
    "the shape and the size of the extra dimensions are stabilized by magnetic flux of a @xmath2 gauge field and the geometry on each brane is either minkowski or de sitter .",
    "since all moduli are stabilized , it is expected that the @xmath3-dimensional einstein gravity should be recovered on each brane . in ref .",
    "@xcite we analyzed how the hubble expansion rate on each brane changes when the brane tension changes .",
    "the resulting relation between the hubble expansion rate and the brane tension can be considered as an effective friedmann equation , which in turn defines an effective newton s constant .",
    "it was shown that at sufficiently low hubble expansion rates , the effective newton s constant resulting from this analysis agrees with that inferred by simply integrating extra dimensions out .",
    "the stability of this model was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the background with minkowski branes is always stable against linear perturbations with axisymmetry in the extra dimensions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study stability of backgrounds with de sitter branes .",
    "this is not just a trivial extension of the previous analysis but actually results in a qualitatively different picture .",
    "indeed , the background becomes unstable when the hubble expansion rate becomes too large .",
    "( for other models , see for example  @xcite . )",
    "we shall obtain the critical expansion rate at which the background becomes unstable and interpret this behavior in terms of de sitter thermodynamics .",
    "spacetimes with horizons appear mysterious in many respects .",
    "an observer does not have causal contact with any events beyond a horizon and , in this sense , the horizon separates the region behind it from the observer s side .",
    "thus , from the observer s viewpoint , information beyond the horizon is completely irrelevant ( as far as classical evolution in the observable region is concerned ) .",
    "this , nothing but a restatement of the definition of horizons , suggests a coarse - grained description of a physical system in or of a spacetime with horizons .",
    "it is therefore not totally surprising that a spacetime with horizons exhibits properties analogous to those of thermodynamics .",
    "indeed , in the case of black holes such properties are known as black hole thermodynamics  .",
    "black hole entropy , defined as one quarter of horizon area in planck units , is central to black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the second law of black hole thermodynamics states that black hole entropy never decreases classically .",
    "its semi - classical extension , known as the generalized second law , states that the sum of black hole entropy and matter entropy does not decrease .",
    "these second laws are direct analogues of the second law of ordinary thermodynamics and restrict directions in which a physical system involving black holes can evolve . in ordinary thermodynamics",
    "it is due to the second law that entropy can be used to analyze stability of a thermodynamic system .",
    "therefore , the validity of the second law of black hole thermodynamics suggests potential use of black hole entropy to guess stability of a system including black holes or objects ( branes , strings , rings , and so on )  @xcite .",
    "( also , for a review see e.g.  @xcite and references therein . )",
    "the close connection between black hole event horizons and thermodynamics can be extended to event horizons in cosmological models with a positive cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "the de sitter thermodynamics includes concepts of de sitter temperature and de sitter entropy .",
    "in this paper we shall extend the de sitter entropy to our braneworld set - up with two extra dimensions and use it to `` predict '' the stability condition for the backgrounds with de sitter branes .",
    "intriguingly , the simple `` prediction '' by de sitter entropy completely agrees with the result of rather involved analysis of linear perturbations .",
    "this is really non - trivial and may be considered as an evidence showing the usefulness of de sitter entropy and , more generally , holographic principle  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:6dwfc ] we briefly review our @xmath0-dimensional braneworld model with de sitter branes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermodynamics ] we study thermodynamic stability of the spacetime by using entropy . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamical ] , in order to investigate dynamical stability we consider linear perturbation around the background solution . in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize the results and discuss them .",
    "we consider a 6d einstein  maxwell system described by the action @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the 6d bulk cosmological constant @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the field strength of the @xmath2 gauge field @xmath8 introduced to stabilize the extra dimensions .",
    "( we use units with @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the 6d newton s constant unless otherwise noted . )",
    "the braneworld solution is @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the metric of the 4-dimensional spacetime with a constant curvature @xmath14 , i.e.  de sitter ( @xmath15 ) , minkowski ( @xmath16 ) , or anti - de sitter ( ads ) ( @xmath17 ) spacetime . without loss of generality",
    ", we can normalize @xmath14 to @xmath18 except for the minkowski ( @xmath16 ) case .",
    "we consider the range of parameters in which @xmath19 has two positive roots , and locate two 3-branes at the positions of the two roots @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "we call the branes at @xmath22 the @xmath23-branes , respectively",
    ". the tension of each brane determines a conical deficit in the extra dimensions . to be precise ,",
    "the period of the angular coordinate ( @xmath24 ) is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 are tensions of the branes at @xmath20 .",
    "this braneworld model includes two compact extra dimensions and two 3-branes at @xmath20 with the tensions @xmath26 . for @xmath27 , the geometries on the brane at @xmath20 are the 4d de sitter spacetimes with the hubble expansion rates @xmath28 , respectively . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the brane geometry is the minkowski spacetime . in each case",
    "the energy scale on each brane is scaled by the warp factor @xmath29 depending on the position of the brane .",
    "the role of the @xmath2 field is to stabilize extra dimensions with magnetic flux .",
    "now , for later convenience we re - scale coordinates and parameters of the geometry with the 4d hubble parameter @xmath30 on the @xmath31-brane in the following manner : @xmath32 where we have omitted the subscript `` @xmath33 '' of @xmath30 and the tilde denotes re - scaled quantities .",
    "after this re - scaling , we obtain @xmath34 where @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the metric of the 4d de sitter spacetime with the hubble parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the metric function now satisfies @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the ratio of the warp factors at the branes and , at the same time , describes how the geometry of the 2d extra dimensions is warped .",
    "note that in the special case @xmath40 the geometry is not warped but locally a round sphere .",
    "advantages of this re - scaled parameterization are as follows .",
    "first , the new parameters and coordinates remain finite and regular in the limit where the geometries on the branes become minkowski .",
    "second , since the warp factor evaluated at the @xmath31-brane is unity ( @xmath41 ) , many quantities rooted in these coordinates have physical meaning as observables measured by observers on the @xmath31-brane . as we will see later , a kaluza ",
    "klein ( kk ) mass measured on the @xmath31-brane remains finite in the @xmath42 limit , while that on the @xmath43-brane diverges .",
    "hence , it is useful ( in particular for the purpose of numerical calculations ) to use quantities measured on the @xmath31-brane . of course",
    ", if we know the value of a quantity measured on the @xmath31 brane then we can easily obtain the corresponding value measured on the @xmath43-brane by multiplying the warp factor @xmath44 , e.g. , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and so on , where @xmath47 is the kk mass observed on the @xmath48-brane .",
    "we introduce another convenient parameter @xmath49 . from @xmath38",
    "we obtain the relation @xmath50 since @xmath51 , the hubble parameter @xmath37 has a maximum value @xmath52 for a given @xmath44 .",
    "hence we define @xmath49 by @xmath53 which is the squared hubble parameter @xmath54 on the @xmath31-brane normalized by @xmath52 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath49 could be defined as @xmath55 normalized by its maximum value , but the two definitions are actually equivalent .",
    "thus , @xmath49 describes how much the @xmath3d part of the metric is curved .",
    "when @xmath56 , the 4d spacetime becomes flat   then the solution represents a braneworld with ads branes . in this paper",
    ", however , we shall not consider this case , focusing only on the de sitter ( @xmath57 ) and minkowski ( @xmath56 ) branes . ] .",
    "in contrast , in the maximal case ( @xmath58 ) , the flux disappears : @xmath59 .    for a fixed bulk cosmological constant @xmath5 and a fixed discrete parameter @xmath14 ( @xmath60 ) , the solution is locally parameterized by the two parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "however it is more convenient to use the pair of dimension - less parameters @xmath63 , both of which run over the finite interval @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "this parameterization includes both @xmath65 ( @xmath57 ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath56 ) cases , and treats the de sitter and the minkowski branes in the common way .    in the following sections we use the parameters ( @xmath44 , @xmath49 ) and the coordinates ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) to describe the background geometry .",
    "as stated in the introduction , one of the main subjects in this paper is the close connection between thermodynamic and dynamical properties of spacetimes . in particular",
    ", we shall see exact agreement between thermodynamic and dynamical stabilities for the @xmath0-dimensional brane world solutions described in the previous section . in this section",
    "we discuss thermodynamic stability by using the de sitter entropy .",
    "we also point out the close relation between the specific heat and the effective friedmann equation .      in the @xmath3-dimensional einstein gravity , a de sitter space has entropy given by one quarter of the area of the horizon  @xcite .",
    "this is an analogue of the well - known black hole entropy and has been the basis of holographic arguments for de sitter spaces  @xcite .    in the 6d braneworld background solution ,",
    "each point in the 2d extra dimensions corresponds to a 4d de sitter space .",
    "therefore , we shall define the de sitter entropy in our context by one quarter of the area of the cosmological horizon integrated over the extra dimensions , i.e. , one quarter of the volume of the 4-dimensional surface foliated by de sitter horizons : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the 4-dimensional volume given by @xmath71 and @xmath10 is the 6d newton s constant . note that , for the convenience of the discussion , we have temporarily restored @xmath10 in this paragraph . actually , it is easy to show that this definition agrees with the definition of the 4d de sitter entropy that observers on each brane would adopt .",
    "the area of the de sitter horizon and the newton s constant on the @xmath72-brane are , respectively , given by @xmath73 and @xmath74 thus , the 4d de sitter entropies on the @xmath72-branes are @xmath75 respectively .",
    "these do indeed agree with the above definition based on the horizon area integrated over the extra dimensions : @xmath76 in the 4d picture , the integration over extra dimensions is taken care of by the above formula of the 4d newton s constant ( [ eqn : gn ] ) .",
    "since the three different definitions agree , we have a unique definition of de sitter entropy in our braneworld set - up .    to investigate the thermodynamic stability of the system , it is useful to consider the de sitter entropy as a function of conserved quantities .",
    "the family of solutions described in the previous section has three conserved quantities : the total magnetic flux and the tensions of two branes . the total magnetic flux @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 by eq .  ( [ eq : delta_phi ] ) , tensions @xmath79 of the @xmath72-branes are expressed as @xmath80 respectively , where @xmath81 are defined by @xmath82 since there is one - to - one correspondence between @xmath79 and @xmath81",
    ", we can consider the de sitter entropy @xmath83 as a function of either ( @xmath77 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) or ( @xmath77 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) .",
    "variables @xmath83 , @xmath77 and @xmath88 defined above are proportional to @xmath89 .",
    "because of this trivial dependence , we can eliminate @xmath89 from all thermodynamic considerations by properly normalizing the variables .",
    "in particular , in appendix  [ sec : thermodynamic_relatios ] it is shown that the entropy normalized by @xmath87 , @xmath90 , satisfies the differential relation @xmath91 where @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is the normalized total flux .",
    "this means that the normalized entropy @xmath94 is a function of the two variables @xmath95 and @xmath96 : @xmath97 .",
    "hereafter , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are to be considered as two independent thermodynamic variables .",
    "this accords with the observation made in the previous section : the family of solutions are parameterized by two parameters ( @xmath44 , @xmath49 ) after proper scaling of variables .",
    "the angular period @xmath89 has been eliminated so that @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 do not depend on it .",
    "note that the normalization factor @xmath98 is just a fixed constant from the viewpoint of observers on the @xmath31-brane since these observers are to see the response of the 4d geometry induced on the @xmath31-brane to the change of the tension @xmath84 or equivalently , @xmath86 .",
    "in particular , with @xmath87 fixed , we have @xmath99 thus , the relation ( [ eq : first_law ] ) is relevant for observers on the @xmath31-brane ( but not for those on the @xmath43-brane ) .",
    "alternatively , we could write down a differential relation relevant for observers on the @xmath43-brane by normalizing the variables by the factor @xmath100 , which is a constant from the viewpoint of observers on the @xmath43-brane . in this sense , we have two conceptually different pictures : one from @xmath31-brane perspectives and the other from @xmath43-brane perspectives .",
    "the result of the thermodynamic stability analysis does not depend on the picture : the result from one picture completely agrees with that from the other picture . in the following",
    ", we shall see the thermodynamic stability from the @xmath31-brane perspectives .",
    "thus , unless there is a possibility of confusion , we omit the subscripts `` @xmath101 '' .     as a function of @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "different points on the surface @xmath102 represent different background solutions , and there is no background solution outside the domain of @xmath103 .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath103 is not single - valued but actually double - valued in some part of its domain .",
    "thus , the family of background solutions has two branches , divided by a critical curve on which some derivatives of @xmath103 are singular . the high - entropy branch is thermodynamically preferred to the low - entropy branch . ]",
    "[ fig : entropy ] shows the graph of the normalized de sitter entropy @xmath94 as a function of the conserved quantities @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "as we can easily see , @xmath103 is not single - valued but actually double - valued in some part of its domain .",
    "it is also easy to see that derivatives of @xmath103 are singular on a part of the boundary of the domain .",
    "we call this part of the boundary of the domain the _ critical curve_. different points on the surface @xmath102 represent different background solutions , i.e.  different spacetimes .",
    "( there is no background solution outside the domain of @xmath103 . )",
    "therefore , the critical curve divides the family of solutions into two distinct branches : one with larger @xmath94 and the other with smaller @xmath94 .",
    "we call them the _ high - entropy branch _ and the _ low - entropy branch _",
    ", respectively . by definition ,",
    "these two branches merge on the critical curve .",
    "note that in some region of the low - entropy branch , @xmath103 is single - valued .",
    "if the de sitter entropy has any physical meaning like entropy in ordinary thermodynamics then the high - entropy branch must be thermodynamically preferred in some sense and must be more stable than the low - entropy branch .",
    "the spacetime is marginally stable on the critical curve .",
    "these observations are based only on our intuition that the de sitter entropy should play a role similar to that of entropy in ordinary thermodynamics . nonetheless ,",
    "surprisingly , we shall see in the next section that these observations correctly `` predict '' the result of rather detailed analysis of dynamical stability against linear perturbations .",
    "we now derive an explicit equation describing the critical curve . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the coordinate transformation from @xmath104 defined in the previous section to @xmath105 defined above . as we shall see below",
    ", the critical curve is the set of points where this coordinate transformation becomes singular . as noticed in sec .",
    "[ sec:6dwfc ] , @xmath44 ( @xmath106$])is the ratio of the warp factors of two branes and describes the shape of the two - dimensional extra space . on the other hand @xmath49 ( @xmath107 $ ] ) represents the curvature of 4d de sitter space normalized by the maximum value @xmath108 for a given @xmath44 .",
    "since the background solution is uniquely specified by @xmath104 up to the scaling explained in the previous section , any ( properly normalized ) quantities can be rewritten as functions of @xmath104 . in particular , we have two single - valued functions @xmath109 and @xmath110 as a map @xmath111 .",
    "the entropy @xmath94 is also a single - valued function of @xmath104 and , thus , the critical curve is determined by vanishing jacobian determinant of this map : @xmath112 this condition can be solved with respect to @xmath49 to give the following expression for the critical value of @xmath49 : @xmath113 .",
    "\\end{aligned }   \\label{eq : critical_curve}\\ ] ] this is the analytic expression for the critical curve . as we see later , @xmath114 ( or , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) is nothing but the critical value for stabilizing the extra dimensions like in freund ",
    "rubin compactification  @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the ( normalized ) de sitter entropy is not a single - valued function but actually a double - valued function of the conserved quantities @xmath105 in some region of the domain .",
    "this observation has led us to a rather natural stability criterion that the high - entropy branch should be stable and that the low - entropy branch should be unstable .",
    "this is a global statement : we would not be able to say one of the two branches should be stable or unstable without knowing the existence of the other branch .    in this subsection , we look at the stability from a different viewpoint , considering the effective friedmann equation investigated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we shall see that the thermodynamic stability is equivalent to the positivity of an _ effective newton s constant_. note that , while the thermodynamic stability is a global statement , the positivity of the effective newton s constant is a local statement .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite we showed that the 4d friedmann equation is recovered on the brane at sufficiently low energy as the response of the 4d hubble expansion rate to the change of the brane tension . to be more precise , for small hubble expansion rates @xmath37 ,",
    "@xmath54 is expanded as @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the brane tension and the 4d newton s constant @xmath119 is obtained by simply integrating extra dimensions out as ( [ eqn : gn ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath120 is the value of @xmath118 for the minkowski brane ( @xmath121 ) and depends on @xmath77 and @xmath85 , which are actually constants from the viewpoint of observers on the @xmath31-brane .",
    "note that the 4d newton s constant @xmath119 defined as ( [ eqn : gn ] ) is always positive .",
    "the terms of order @xmath122 and higher are small compared with the linear term if the hubble expansion rate is sufficiently lower than the energy scale set by the bulk cosmological constant .",
    "however , for larger @xmath54 , the higher order corrections become relevant and @xmath54 is no longer approximately linear .",
    "moreover , as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : hubble ] , @xmath54 is not necessarily an increasing function of the brane tension . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath54 is larger than a critical value then it is a decreasing function of the brane tension . to make this peculiar behavior more quantitative ,",
    "let us define the effective newton s constant @xmath123 on the @xmath31-brane by @xmath124 and characterize the critical value by @xmath125 .",
    "for @xmath37 smaller ( or larger ) than the critical value , @xmath123 is positive ( or negative , respectively ) .",
    "note that , since this effective newton s constant runs as the hubble expansion rate @xmath37 changes , the exact agreement with @xmath119 is met only in the @xmath126 limit .",
    "the agreement in this limit itself is a rather non - trivial consequence of the dynamics of bulk spacetime as explicitly shown in @xcite , but physical interpretation is simple .",
    "while @xmath119 was determined via the coefficient of the contribution of the graviton zero mode to the higher dimensional action , @xmath123 here incorporates contributions of all kaluza ",
    "klein modes as well as the zero mode . since kaluza ",
    "klein contributions are irrelevant at low energies , these two definitions should agree . on the other hand , at high energies the kaluza ",
    "klein modes become relevant and make @xmath123 deviate from @xmath119 .",
    ", as a function of @xmath95 and @xmath96 . for small @xmath54",
    ", @xmath127 is negative .",
    "however , as @xmath54 increases , the slope turns over and @xmath127 becomes positive .",
    "( this figure is identical to fig .  3 of ref .  @xcite . ) ]    in order to examine the curve @xmath125 , the following observation is useful : @xmath128 since @xmath37 and @xmath96 are single - valued smooth functions of @xmath63 , the jacobian @xmath129 does not diverge .",
    "hence , @xmath123 diverges if and only if the denominator @xmath130 vanishes .",
    "this condition is nothing but eq .",
    "( [ eqn : critical - curve - jacobian ] ) characterizing the critical curve , which divides the parameter space of background solutions into the high - entropy branch and the low - entropy branch .",
    "therefore , @xmath131    additionally , it is worth mentioning that the effective newtion s constant has a connection with thermodynamic quantities on the brane . in the 4d case",
    "we can define a temperature of the de sitter space by the hubble parameter @xmath132 as @xmath133 .",
    "then , in a straightforward manner , the specific heat is given by @xmath134 now , concerning the 4d de sitter brane , we consider a specific heat regarding @xmath135 as its temperature . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : first_law ] ) we obtain @xmath136 this expression is the same as that of the 4d de sitter space except for its gravitational `` constant . ''",
    "for the 4d de sitter brane the sign of the specific heat will change on the critical curve also .",
    "hence , from the viewpoint of the 4d effective theory , we conclude that the effective newton s constant on the brane determines thermodynamic properties of the braneworld .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed the thermodynamic stability of the 6d braneworld model as a property of the background solution .",
    "now let us investigate the dynamical stability of this spacetime .",
    "for this purpose , we consider linear perturbations around the background solution .",
    "perturbations are decomposed into scalar- , vector- and tensor - sectors according to the representation of the 4d de sitter symmetry . if the mass squared of the kaluza ",
    "klein modes @xmath137 is negative , then the corresponding mode is tachyonic and unstable .    since the background spacetime forms a two - parameter family of solutions , the system of the perturbation equations depends on two parameters ( @xmath44,@xmath49 ) .",
    "we investigate the lowest mass squared @xmath138 in each sector as a function of the two parameters in the square domain @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "our strategy for attacking the problem is as follows .",
    "first , we analytically solve the perturbation equations in the @xmath40 case for arbitrary @xmath141 $ ] , and obtain @xmath142 on the side @xmath143 of the square domain .",
    "next , by successively applying the relaxation method , we numerically calculate @xmath138 as @xmath44 changes from @xmath144 to @xmath145 for every @xmath49 . in each step of the second procedure ,",
    "the result of the previous step with a slightly larger value of @xmath44 is used as an initial guess for the relaxation method .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ app : gauge ] , the scalar perturbation with an appropriate gauge choice is given by @xmath146\\frac{\\mathrm dr^2}{f }     + [ 1 - ( \\phi_1 + 3\\phi_2)y]f\\mathrm d\\phi^2,\\\\    a_m\\mathrm dx^m & = ( a + a_\\phi y)\\mathrm d\\phi ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath147 is the scalar harmonics on the 4d de sitter space satisfying @xmath148 here , @xmath149 is the covariant derivative associated with the 4-dimensional de sitter spacetime with the hubble @xmath37 . the einstein equation and the maxwell equation",
    "are reduced to the following two perturbation equations for @xmath150 and @xmath151 : @xmath152 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath66 , and @xmath137 is the eigenvalue of the harmonics .",
    "the boundary conditions at @xmath153 are obtained by setting the coefficients of @xmath154 in ( [ eq : scalar_perturbation - original ] ) to zero at the brane positions , as in @xcite .",
    "hence we have @xmath155 an alternative and more rigorous derivation of the boundary conditions is to use the formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath156_{r=\\alpha,1 } = 0 .",

    "<S> perturbations are decomposed into scalar , vector and tensor sectors according to the representation of the 4d de sitter symmetry , and each sector is analysed separately . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that when the hubble expansion rates on the branes are too large , there appears a tachyonic mode in the scalar sector and the background solution becomes dynamically unstable . </S>",
    "<S> we show analytically that the onset of the thermodynamic instability and that of the dynamical instability exactly coincide . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the braneworld model provides a new example illustrating close relations between thermodynamic and dynamical instability . </S>"
