    "the secret sharing schemes are originally proposed by shamir @xcite and blackley @xcite in 1979 .",
    "the motivation was to safeguard cryptographic keys.their solution was to store the secret keys at several locations as shares and when authorized number of users collaborate together , they can retrieve the secret.the schemes are @xmath2 threshold schemes where any @xmath3 number of users can collaborate to recover the secret out of @xmath4 users.this provides both security , reliability and convenience.shamirs scheme is simple and easy to implement and is based on polynomial interpolation.blackleys scheme has a different approach and is based on hyperplane geometry.but it is difficult to implement.secret sharing schemes have found numerous applications in designing several cryptographic protocols .",
    "threshold cryptography @xcite , access control @xcite , secure multi - party computation @xcite @xcite @xcite , attribute based encryption @xcite @xcite , generalized oblivious transfer @xcite @xcite , visual cryptography @xcite @xmath5 are some of the important areas where secret sharing schemes are used.in this paper we suggest efficient secret sharing schemes for the reliable and secure distributed storage of data on untrusted servers .",
    "shamir s scheme is based on polynomial interpolation over a finite field .",
    "it uses the fact that we can construct a polynomial of degree @xmath6 only if @xmath3 data points are given.the scheme is based on polynomial interpolation.given @xmath3 points in the 2-dimensional plane @xmath7 , with distinct @xmath8 s , there is one and only one polynomial @xmath9 of degree @xmath6 such that @xmath10 for all @xmath11.in order to share the secret @xmath12 , pick a random @xmath6 degree polynomial @xmath13 with @xmath14,and evaluate shares as @xmath15.any subset of @xmath3 of these shares @xmath16 together with their identifying indices , we can find the coefficients of @xmath9 by interpolation , and then evaluate @xmath17.the knowledge of just @xmath6 of these values , does not suffice in order to calculate @xmath12.efficient @xmath18 algorithms exist for the evaluation and interpolation of polynomials .",
    "a secret sharing scheme is called perfect if less than @xmath3 shares give no information about the secret.it is known that for a perfect secret sharing scheme @xmath19 . if @xmath20 then the secret sharing scheme is called ideal .",
    "shamir s scheme is perfect and ideal.blackleys scheme is not perfect .",
    "confidentiality , reliability and efficiency are the major concerns in secure storage of data.the idea of secret sharing for the information dispersal is suggested by krawczyk et al @xcite in 1994.he proposed a computationally secure secret sharing scheme for the distributed storage using rabin s @xcite information dispersal algorithm and shamir s secret sharing scheme.however the data is encrypted using a symmetric key encryption and the share of the key is distributed along with the data shares.the share size is less than the secret in this case compromising the information theoretic security.abhishek parak et al @xcite in 2010 proposed a space efficient secret sharing scheme for the implicit data security.they incorporated @xmath21 secrets in @xmath4 shares and any @xmath22 shares can be used to reconstruct the original secret.a recursive construction using shamir s scheme is applied in which computational over head is more.recursive methods of secret sharing is also mentioned in @xcite , @xcite.computational secret sharing schemes are proposed for the space efficiency in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "secret sharing based solution provides information theoretical security on confidentiality with out encryption and hence avoid the complexities associated with encryption and key management.it also provides the guarantee on availability of data.perfect secret sharing needs large amount of computational overhead.we propose specially designed secret sharing schemes using xor and number theoretic technique to reduce the computation overhead.unanimous consent schemes are easy to implement using xor.but the implementation of a general @xmath2 threshold scheme is difficult.wang et al @xcite proposed a scheme based on boolean operation which is used for secret image sharing in 2007.kurihara et al @xcite,@xcite proposed a @xmath23 and a generalized @xmath2 secret sharing scheme based on simple xor operations.efficient and ideal threshold scheme based on xor is proposed by lv et al @xcite in 2010 .",
    "secret sharing using number theoretic schemes are also developed based on chinese reminder theorem @xcite,@xcite,@xcite.they are not widely used because of the computational complexity.the proposed scheme make use of simple number theoretic concept and the euclid s algorithm .",
    "the proposed system suggests a method of storing and retrieving private data in a secure and effective manner .",
    "the private data include personal information , sensitive information or unique identification etc .",
    "the data storage may be a private information storage using cloud database.we propose number theoretic and xor based scheme for efficient implementation of secret sharing scheme.it can be used for secure storage and retrieval.since it does not involve any encryption , the pki needed for key management can be avoided.section 2.1 contains the detailed description of the secret sharing algorithm using number theoretic concept.section 2.2 explains the xor based schemes.the algorithms mentioned below are designed to share one byte of data at a time.the scheme can be used to share both textual data and images .      in this section",
    "the proposed secret sharing schemes which are based on number theoretic concepts and are explained in detail.two threshold secret sharing schemes of order @xmath0 and @xmath1 are proposed.the algorithm [ alg : twobythree ] is the @xmath0 secret sharing phase and the retrieval algorithms depend on which shares are used for the reconstruction and are given in algorithms [ alg : s1s2 ] , [ alg : s1s3],[alg : s2s3].a @xmath1 secret sharing scheme is mentioned in algorithm [ alg : twobyfour].the secret revealing algorithms corresponds to different combination of shares are given in algorithms [ alg : s1s2 - 24],[alg : s1s3 - 24],[alg : s1s4 - 24],[alg : s2s4 - 24],[alg : s3s4 - 24].the algorithms use simple number theory concept.in order to find the inverse of a number extended euclid s algorithm can be used.the share generation can be done with a complexity of @xmath24 and the secret revealing can be done with a complexity of @xmath25 , where @xmath4 is the number of bytes to share .",

    "the confidentiality , availability and performance requirement of storage system is addressed in this paper.secret sharing based solutions provides information theoretic security and also provides trust and reliability.we developed simple xor based schemes which is easy to implement and increase the performance.the storage requirement can also be reduced if we use scheme where the share size is only half the size of the original secret.the schemes mentioned in this paper are simple and easy to implement when sharing data with third party servers.the cost factor must also be considered.a @xmath30 or @xmath31 schemes are the best choices.the cost factor can also be reduced by using the non ideal xor based scheme where the share size is reduced to half but the information theoretic security is compromised.a secret vector which indicates the share number that each server stores can be kept secret.a simple substitution or transposition cipher can also be used as a preprocessing step before sharing the file for additional security .the use of these schemes can be further explored in other areas where the threshold required is as specified in the algorithm .",

    "<S> secret sharing is a new alternative for outsourcing data in a secure way.it avoids the need for time consuming encryption decryption process and also the complexity involved in key management.the data must also be protected from untrusted cloud service providers.secret sharing based solution provides secure information dispersal by making shares of the original data and distribute them among different servers.data from the threshold number of servers can be used to reconstruct the original data.it is often impractical to distribute data among large number of servers.we have to achieve a trade off between security and efficiency.an optimal choice is to use a @xmath0 or @xmath1 threshold secret sharing scheme , where the data are distributed as shares among three or four servers and shares from any two can be used to construct the original data.this provides both security , reliability and efficiency.we propose some efficient and easy to implement secret sharing schemes in this regard based on number theory and bitwise xor.these schemes are also suitable for secure sharing of images.secret image sharing based on shamir s schemes are lossy and involves complicated lagrange interpolation.so the proposed scheme can also be effectively utilized for lossless sharing of secret images .    </S>",
