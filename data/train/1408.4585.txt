    "moreover for some classical models of infinite chains @xcite , the classical chimera states present an infinite life duration and correspond to a permanent regime . in quantum mechanics , classical permanent regimes become quantum stationary eigenstates . for example , the classical permanent regimes of the harmonic oscillator ( sinusoidal oscillations with respect to the time ) become stationary quantum eigenstates ( product of an hermite polynomial with an exponential with respect to the displacement ) ; and the classical permanent regimes of the classical keplerian problem ( elliptic orbits followed with respect to the time ) becomes the stationary hydrogen wavefunctions .",
    "the dynamical character of the permanent classical regimes becomes the non - local character of the stationary quantum eigenstates ( spatial delocalisation , entanglement , etc ) .",
    "in contrast , transient regime states are time - dependent both for classical and quantum dynamics .",
    "the classical metastable regimes ( regimes with a long life duration but not infinite ) seem to become quantum stationary eigenstates but associated with a non - hermiticity ( the left eigenvectors are different from the right ones , in accordance with the difference concerning the evolutions to the future and to the past induced by the irreversible collapse or destabilisation of the state at the end of its life duration ) . for example to make appear quantum resonances in the spectral properties , it is necessary to use a complex dilation or an optical potential which induces that the hamiltonian becomes non - hermitian ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is then not surprising for a finite chain of spins , to find analogues of long life duration classical chimera states as quantum stationary eigenstates associated with the non - hermiticity of the hamiltonian .",
    "the dynamical character of the classical chimera states is replaced by the non - local character of the entanglement of the spins ( green regions in figures [ chimeria1 ] and [ chimeria2 ] ) .",

    "but if the spins are in mixed states , @xmath84 includes also the entanglement entropy of the chain .",
