    "this paper investigates the dynamics of a crystal step ( the terrace edge ) in the conditions that mimic those in the chemical vapor or beam epitaxy of thin films and its variants ( the chemical vapor deposition , metal - organic vapor phase epitaxy , etc . ) in the chemical epitaxy the precursor molecules are deposited onto a crystal surface which consists of alternating terraces and steps , undergo diffusion on the terraces and then decompose into the atomic constituents . these adatoms in turn undergo diffusion and then are incorporated into the solid by attachment at the steps .    despite the abundance of the physico - mathematical models of thwe molecular beam epitaxy ( based on a partial differential equations , atomistic , or multi - scale ) - whereby",
    "there is a single deposited species and no chemical reaction - there is only a handful of models for the epitaxy of multiple atomic species with or without chemical reaction effects .",
    "for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite the authors study the reaction - diffusion models for the dynamics of a monolayer , where the reaction terms represent the adsorption - desorption and chemical processes , and the diffusion is affected by the nearest - neighbor attractive interactions between the deposited atoms and also by the adatoms - substrate interactions .",
    "they find the emergence of self - assembled one - dimensional structures that may precipitate different types of film growth mechanisms . in refs .",
    "@xcite an elaborate thermomechanical model for step - flow growth is analyzed , where the diffusing species are coupled through a chemical reaction whereby bulk molecules are crystallized from adatoms attaching to the step edges ; the model ensures a configurational force balance at the steps through the generalization of the classical gibbs - thomson relation . and in refs .",
    "@xcite a simpler one - dimensional bcf@xcite - type model is developed and applied for the analysis of step bunching . in this model",
    "the diffusion of adatoms is one - way coupled - through the source term in the diffusion equation - to the diffusion of precursor molecules .",
    "the source term originates in decomposition of the precursor , and the corresponding physical boundary conditions are formulated for both species at the step .",
    "the latter model has its predecessor in the work by pimpinelli _",
    "_ @xcite .    in this paper the model of refs .",
    "@xcite is extended to two dimensions , where the step edge is a plane curve .",
    "the goal is to study how the interplay of the precursor and adatom diffusion , desorption , precursor decomposition and adatom attachment to the step influence the step stability and its growth .",
    "( note that desorption of adatoms is neglected in refs .",
    "step meandering ( lateral modulations ) is the prominent feature in the experiments @xcite .",
    "the meandering can be only studied theoretically using a two - dimensional model .",
    "the first stage in such study is to consider processes such as diffusion on a single ( lower ) terrace bordering the step ( the one - sided model ) .",
    "this greatly simplifies derivations while retaining most of the important physics , and thus we adopt such approach .",
    "besides this simplification , the only other simplification within the framework of bcf - type modeling is the neglect of the adatom diffusion along the step ( the line diffusion ) . on the other hand",
    ", we include the rarely considered ( due to the complexity of a treatment ) diffusion anisotropy on a terrace , both for the precursors and adatoms ; the anisotropy of line energy ; and the anisotropic attachment kinetics . thus we consider the full range of anisotropic effects , whose importance was very recently re - emphasized in connection to the island growth on terraces @xcite .",
    "it was also argued by same authors in ref .",
    "@xcite that these effects , as well as the coupled dynamics of the precursors and adatoms are important in epitaxial graphene growth on metals .",
    "we largely follow these papers in the introduction and notations of the anisotropies .",
    "( for a more general treatment of the terrace diffusion anisotropy see ref .",
    "the derivation relies on a long - wave expansion .",
    "there is close physical and mathematical analogy ( noted by many authors and also in ref .",
    "@xcite ) between growth of a crystal into a hypercooled melt and the step growth within the one - sided model . thus in developing the long - wave evolution pde for the step profile",
    "we pay close attention to the paper by golovin _",
    "@xcite , who applied this framework to investigate faceting of the growing crystal surface .",
    "our evolution pde will be a generalization of the one they obtained .",
    "( it must be noted that we are concerned only with a weakly anisotropic step energy , in contrast to a strongly anisotropic surface energy in ref .",
    "we consider a morphological evolution of an unstable monoatomic step on a crystal surface .",
    "a step grows by the flux of adatoms from the lower terrace .",
    "the adatoms are the product of the precursors decomposition , and the latter are deposited on a terrace either by condensation from a vapor phase or by a molecular beam .",
    "( if the initially straight step is at @xmath0 , then the lower terrace is the domain @xmath1 . )",
    "the governing equations of the model are the steady - state diffusion equations for the concentrations of the precursors ( a ) and adatoms ( c ) on the lower terrace , the mass conservation conditions at the terrace edge @xmath2 ( the step ) , the gibbs - thomson boundary conditions for the concentrations at the step , and the boundary conditions for the concentrations on the lower terrace far from the step .",
    "the problem for the precursors reads @xcite : @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the diffusion tensor , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the desorption and decomposition rates on a terrace , @xmath9 is the deposition flux , @xmath10 is the kinetic coefficient , and @xmath11 is the unit normal to the step pointing into lower terrace .",

    "the step stiffness and kinetic anisotropies are chosen smooth and periodic @xcite : @xmath58 @xmath59 the conditions on the amplitudes @xmath60 ensure that the anisotropies are positive and thus no orientations are  missing \" from the equilibrium and kinetic shapes of the step .",

    "the assumption that the off - diagonal elements of the tensors are o(1 ) in @xmath63 is consistent with the long - wave expansion presented in the next section .",
    "clearly , we also assumed that the diffusion anisotropy is the same for the precursors and adatoms , and the only difference is the magnitudes of the diffusivities @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath69 , the diffusion is isotropic . when @xmath70 and @xmath66 is the root of @xmath71 , the diffusion is weakly anisotropic ; for other @xmath66 values it is strongly anisotropic",
    "the consideration in this paper will be limited to :    1 .",

    "these limits ( as well as any finite variations of @xmath76 ) can be achieved either by varying @xmath81 at fixed @xmath8 , or vice versa , by varying @xmath8 at fixed @xmath81 . in the former case @xmath76 and @xmath82 ( the far field precursor concentration )",
    "are the only parameters that change values , but in the latter case also @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 change .",
