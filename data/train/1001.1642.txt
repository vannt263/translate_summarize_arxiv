    "this matter exists in the neutron star cores , and hence these stars provide natural laboratories to study the supranuclear degenerate matter .",
    "the study of this dense matter is not only important from the point of view of the particle physics , but also can be useful to understand the core collapse of massive stars , the supernova phenomenon , the existence and properties of neutron stars , etc .",

    "we discuss the measurement methods relevant for neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems @xcite .",
    "an lmxb is an old binary stellar system ( typical age @xmath20 years ) with a low - mass companion star ( @xmath21 ) and a compact star rotating around each other .",
    "the companion star may be a main sequence star , an evolved star or a white dwarf , while the compact star may be a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "in such a system , the companion star fills its roche lobe , i.e. , the critical equipotential surface ( see @xcite ) , and matter from it flows towards the compact star ( neutron star in our case ) .",
    "this matter can not move radially towards the neutron star , as its initial angular momentum is large .",
    "therefore , the accreted matter slowly gets rid of the angular momentum @xcite , follows spiral paths , and hence forms an accretion disk . in neutron star lmxbs",
    ", the accreted matter eventually hits the stellar surface , and generates electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the accretion disk also emits such radiation by viscous dissipation , and both these emissions are powered by the gravitational potential energy release .",
    "the inner part of the accretion disk , and the neutron star surface emit x - rays , as their typical temperature is @xmath22 k. these x - rays are reprocessed by the outer part of the accretion disk , which emits in optical wavelengths .",

    "the neutron stars in lmxbs are expected to be spun up , due to the angular momentum transferred via accretion .",
    "this is consistent with the observed stellar spin frequencies ( typically @xmath23 hz ; see   [ burstoscillationmethod ] ;   [ accretion - poweredmillisecondpulsationmethod ] ) .",
    "the magnetic fields ( @xmath24 g ) of these neutron stars are typically much lower than that of the isolated neutron stars and the stars in high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) systems @xcite .",
    "several groups have worked on this problem of stellar magnetic field evolution @xcite .",
    "note that the low magnetic field allows the accretion disk to extend up to very close to the neutron star .",
    "this , in combination with the fact that x - rays can be detected both from the star and the inner part of the disk for many lmxbs , provides an excellent opportunity to measure the neutron star parameters .",
    "moreover , the signatures of binary orbital motion detected from the optical observation of the accretion disk and the companion star can be useful to measure the neutron star mass .",
    "lmxbs are observed mostly in the galactic plane and bulge , and in the globular clusters .",
    "some of them have also been discovered from the nearby galaxies . according to the catalogue of @xcite , 187 lmxbs ( containing either a neutron star or a black hole )",

    "can not be spatially resolved using the current x - ray imaging instruments , because the distances of even our galactic lmxbs are very large ( typically @xmath25 kpc ) .",
    "therefore , one needs to rely on the spectral and timing properties in order to study these sources in x - rays .",
    "x - rays from space can not reach the surface of the earth .",

    "although , this review does not include the techniques for all types of neutron star systems , the discussed methods form a complete set for the purpose of constraining eos models .",
    "this is because at least three independent parameters of the _ same _ neutron star must be measured to constrain these models ( see   [ introduction ] ) .",
    "we believe that this review is timely , because of several new discoveries and advancement in the field of neutron star lmxbs made in the past few years . to mention a few , ( 1 )",
    "@xcite established that the burst oscillations do give the neutron star spin frequency ( see   [ burstoscillationmethod ] ) ; ( 2 ) the sample size of accretion - powered millisecond - period pulsars has increased from 1 to 12 (   [ whatisanaccretion - poweredaccretion - poweredpulsar ] ) ; ( 3 ) @xcite reported the only plausible observation of the neutron star surface atomic spectral lines ( see   [ spectrallinemethod ] ) ; ( 4 ) @xcite established the inner accretion disk ( or relativistic ) origin of the broad iron line from a neutron star lmxb for the first time ( see   [ whatisabroadrelativisticironline ] ) ; and ( 5 ) @xcite detected the companion star of an lmxb based on bowen blend emission lines , and constrained the neutron star mass using these lines for the first time ( see   [ massmeasurementusingbinaryorbitalmotion ] ) .",
    "x - ray emission of an lmxb from a region close to the neutron star surface contains information about the stellar parameters .",
    "this information can be extracted from the observed spectral and timing properties of these x - rays . here",
    "we discuss the properties of the following five x - ray phenomena , and the methods for neutron star parameter measurement using them : ( 1 ) thermonuclear x - ray bursts ; ( 2 ) accretion - powered millisecond - period pulsations ; ( 3 ) kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ; ( 4 ) broad relativistic iron lines ; and ( 5 ) quiescent emissions .",
    "in addition , we discuss a mass measurement technique based on the orbital motions of the binary components .        eruptions in x - rays are observed from many neutron star lmxb systems every few hours to days @xcite . these are called type - i x - ray bursts .",
    "the observed x - ray intensity sharply increases typically by a factor of @xmath33 in @xmath34 seconds , and then decreases relatively slowly in @xmath35 seconds during such a burst ( @xcite ; see also figure  [ burst2 ] ) .",
    "the typical energy emitted in a few seconds is @xmath36 ergs @xcite .",
    "these bursts were first discovered in 1970 s @xcite . soon after this discovery it was realized that they originate from intermittent unstable nuclear burning of accreted matter on the neutron star surfaces @xcite .",
    "the neutron star surface origin was supported by the observational fact that the burst emission area matched with the expected surface area of a neutron star @xcite .",
    "note that the emission area can be estimated from the fitting of the energy spectra of the bursts .",
    "the unstable burning is required because , while the nuclear energy released per nucleon by fusion is only a few mev , the gravitational energy released by a nucleon falling on the neutron star surface from a large distance is @xmath37 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 are neutron star mass and radius respectively ) , which is typically @xmath38 mev .",
    "therefore , if the nuclear burning were stable , the nuclear energy would be entirely lost in the observed gravitational energy , and the burst could not be powered by the nuclear energy release .",
    "this nuclear burning instability is driven by a nuclear energy generation rate which is more temperature sensitive than the radiative cooling .",
    "such a  thin shell \" instability was first theoretically discovered by @xcite for the asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution , and was shown to occur in the thin shell of hydrogen and helium on neutron star surfaces @xcite . but what shows that the nuclear burning causes the bursts ?",
    "a primary evidence of it comes from the following observational fact . for a data set from a given source , the ratio of the total energy content in all the bursts to that in the non - burst emission roughly tallies with the ratio of the expected nuclear energy release per nucleon to the expected gravitational energy release per nucleon",
    "this strongly suggests that the accreted matter accumulates on the neutron star surface for a long time , and then produces a burst via a quick thermonuclear burning .",
    "therefore these bursts are known as  thermonuclear bursts \" ( see the reviews @xcite and @xcite for detailed descriptions of these bursts ) .    ) .",
    "[ burst2],width=302 ]    for many neutron star lmxbs , the accreted material consists of mostly hydrogen , some helium and a small amount of heavier elements , although for ultra - compact x - ray binaries ( ucxbs ) the donor companion is a hydrogen deficient and heavier element rich dwarf star ( @xcite and references therein ) . the accreted matter , which accumulates on the neutron star surface , undergoes hydrostatic compression as more and more material piles on , and the ignition column density and temperature are reached in a few hours to days @xcite .",
    "the burning typically happens at a depth of @xmath39 m at a column density of @xmath1 gm @xmath40 . the compression rate and the ignition depends on the accretion rate , which sets four distinct theoretically expected regimes of burning @xcite .",
    "+ _ regime 1 _ : the temperature of the accumulated material exceeds @xmath41 k in most cases , and hence the hydrogen burns via the cno ( carbon - nitrogen - oxygen ) cycle instead of the pp ( proton - proton ) cycle .",
    "this causes mixed hydrogen and helium bursts triggered by the unstable hydrogen ignition , which happens for the accretion rate per unit neutron star surface area m @xmath42 gm @xmath40 sec@xmath43 ( @xmath44)@xmath45 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath46 is the mass fraction of cno .",
    "+ _ regime 2 _ : the proton capture timescale becomes shorter than the subsequent @xmath47 decay lifetimes at higher temperatures ( @xmath48 k ) .",
    "hence , the hydrogen burns via the  hot \" cno cycle of @xcite : @xmath49 in this case , the hydrogen burning happens in a thermally stable manner ( i.e. , without triggering a thermonuclear burst ) simultaneously with the accumulation of matter .",

    "the hydrogen entirely burns before this helium is ignited @xcite .",
    "so when the helium ignition happens , a short ( @xmath33 sec ) but very intense burst occurs by the unstable triple - alpha reaction of the pure helium ( @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 ) .",
    "such a burst is called a  helium burst \" . many of these bursts are so intense that the local x - ray luminosity in the neutron star atmosphere may exceed the eddington limit ( for which the radiative pressure force balances the gravitational force ) , and the photospheric layers may be lifted off the neutron star surface .",
    "such bursts are called photospheric radius expansion bursts ( @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "this is because at this higher accretion rate , the helium ignition conditions are satisfied much sooner .",
    "therefore in this regime , mixed hydrogen and helium bursts are triggered by the helium ignition .",
    "during such a burst , the thermal instability can produce elements beyond the iron group @xcite via the rp ( rapid - proton ) process of @xcite .",
    "this is because the triggering helium flash makes the temperature high enough to allow the  breakout reaction \" @xmath58 @xcite from hot cno cycle to proceed faster than the @xmath47 decays .",
    "@xmath59 can return to the hot cno cycle via the chain of reactions @xcite : @xmath60 but if @xmath59 captures a proton by the reaction @xmath61 , the nuclear reactions go out of the hot cno cycle loop , and follow the rp process .",
    "this process burns hydrogen via successive proton capture and @xmath47 decays , and produces a large range of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "the long series of @xmath47 decays makes these bursts typically much longer ( @xmath62 sec ) than the helium bursts .",
    "+ _ regime 4 _ : finally at a very high accretion rate ( comparable to the eddington limit ) , the helium burning temperature sensitivity becomes weaker than the cooling rate s sensitivity @xcite .",
    "therefore in this regime , the stable burning sets in , and the thermonuclear bursts do not occur .",
    "however , recently @xcite have shown that the bursts should not occur even if the accretion rate is more than 30% of the eddington accretion rate , in case @xmath63 reaction rate is lower than usually assumed .",
    "this appears to agree with observations @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite have suggested that for rapidly spinning neutron stars , burning instability sets in ( i.e. , bursts ignite ) preferentially near the equator at low values of accretion rate and off of the equator at higher accretion rates .",
    "apart from usual type - i x - ray bursts , bursts of longer durations have been observed from several sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they have typical durations of @xmath64 minutes and energies @xmath65 ergs .",
    "these bursts are known as long bursts . even longer and more energetic thermonuclear bursts , viz .",
    "superbursts , have been observed from a few neutron star lmxbs ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the typical released energy , recurrence time and decay time of these bursts are @xmath66 ergs , @xmath31 years and @xmath67 hours respectively @xcite .",
    "thermally unstable @xmath56 fusion @xcite at a column depth of @xmath68 gm @xmath40 may cause the superbursts @xcite .",
    "but this explanation has a problem for h / he accretors , because only a small amount of carbon is expected to remain after the burning of h and he via the rp - process .",
    "although several solutions of this problem have been proposed by @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , more detailed theoretical studies are required to understand the origin of superbursts .",
    "the study of thermonuclear bursts provides a unique opportunity to understand some aspects of extreme physics .",
    "in particular , these bursts can be very useful to constrain the neutron star parameters ( see later sections ) , and hence to understand the nature of the stellar core matter at supranuclear densities ( see   1 ) .",
    "however , in order to use these bursts as a reliable tool , they have to be understood well ( see , for example , @xcite for recent burst model calculations ) .",
    "one of the poorly explored aspects of these bursts is the thermonuclear flame spreading on the neutron star surfaces .",
    "it is expected that the accreted matter quickly spreads all over the neutron star surface @xcite .",
    "therefore a burst may ignite at a certain location on the stellar surface @xcite , and then the burning region may expand to cover the entire surface @xcite .",
    "the study of this flame spreading is not only essential to understand the bursts , but also important to use these bursts as a tool to probe the neutron star parameters (   [ burstoscillationmethod ] ) .",
    "however , the theoretical modeling of thermonuclear flame spreading including all the main physical effects is extremely difficult , and only recently @xcite have provided some insights in this field .",
    "although these authors have ignored several physical effects ( magnetic field , strong gravity , etc . ) in their model , they have considered the effects of the coriolis force , which is important as the bursting neutron stars are rapidly spinning ( typical spin frequency @xmath23 hz ) .",
    "the observational study of flame spreading is also no less difficult than the theoretical study .",
    "this is because , this spreading mostly happens within @xmath27 sec during the burst rise , and in order to study it observationally , one needs to detect and measure the evolution of the burst spectral and timing properties during this short time .",
    "therefore , although the observational indications of flame spreading were found about a decade ago ( e.g. , @xcite ) , only recently such spreading could be confirmed and measured for a few bursts by analyzing the _ rxte _ pca data @xcite .",
    "these findings provide the motivation for rigorous theoretical studies including all the main physical effects , as well as for detailed analysis of the burst rise data .",
    "thermonuclear x - ray bursts can be very useful to constrain the neutron star parameters due to the following reasons .",
    "+ ( 1 ) they originate from the neutron star surfaces .",
    "therefore , the stellar parameters ( e.g. , mass , radius , spin frequency ) influence the burst spectral and timing properties .",

    "+ ( 3 ) relatively low magnetic fields ( @xmath69 g ) of the bursting neutron stars simplify the modeling of the surface emission .",
    "+ ( 4 ) the surface emission during a burst is typically about 10 times brighter than the rest of the x - ray emission .",
    "hence the surface emission can be isolated from the total emission relatively easily , and can be used to constrain the neutron star parameters with confidence .",
    "note that this is not true for the non - burst emission , for which it is difficult to distinguish between the surface and the non - surface emissions with sufficient accuracy .",
    "+ ( 5 ) the @xmath33 times higher intensity of bursts , relative to the non - burst intensity , gives a significantly higher signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "+ ( 6 ) many bursts can be observed from the same neutron star .",
    "the values of neutron star mass , radius and spin frequency , which affect the burst properties , do not change from one burst to another for a given source .",
    "therefore , the joint analysis of many bursts , keeping the model values of these stellar parameters same for all the bursts , can be very useful to constrain these parameters .",
    "this technique is demonstrated in @xcite ( see also   [ summaryofthemethodsusingthermonuclearx - raybursts ] ) .",
    "+ ( 7 ) thousands of thermonuclear x - ray bursts have been observed from about 80 sources ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for a catalog of _ rxte _ pca bursts ) .",
    "therefore , a large amount of burst data is already available .",
    "the continuum spectra of thermonuclear x - ray bursts are typically quite well described with a blackbody model ( @xcite ; see also figure  [ spec_bb_fit ] ) .",
    "the temperature of this blackbody increases rapidly as the accumulated matter burns during the burst intensity rise , and then decreases relatively slowly as the neutron star surface cools down during the burst decay .",
    "if the entire neutron star surface emits like a blackbody of the same temperature at a given time , then the inferred radius at infinity ( @xmath70 ) of the neutron star can be obtained from the relation : @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the observed bolometric flux , @xmath73 is the fitted blackbody temperature , @xmath10 is the source distance and @xmath74 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "this provides one of the very few ways to measure the neutron star radius .",
    "note that the radius measurement is typically more difficult than the measurements of the neutron star mass and spin frequency .",
    "this is because , whereas the gravitational effect of mass influences the observed motion of the companion star in a binary system , and the observed flux may be modulated by the neutron star spin , the radius exhibits no such effects . as a result , although the mass and the spin frequency of several neutron stars have been measured @xcite , accurate measurements of the radius are challenging .     to the estimated value ( @xmath75 @xmath40 ) in the source direction for the fitting .",

    "+ ( 1 ) equation  [ bbrad1 ] assumes that the entire stellar surface emits during the burst .",
    "if that is not true , this equation will underestimate the value of the neutron star radius .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the lack of knowledge of the source distance introduces an uncertainty in the neutron star radius value inferred from this method .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the surface gravitational redshift ( @xmath77 ) makes the observed radius @xmath70 and the actual neutron star radius @xmath78 different by an unknown factor .",
    "+ ( 4 ) although a blackbody model fits the observed burst spectrum well , this spectrum can not be the blackbody originated from the burning layer .",
    "this is because the scattering of photons by the electrons and the frequency dependence of the opacity in the neutron star atmosphere hardens the energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "such a hardening shifts the burning layer blackbody spectrum towards the higher energies , and changes its shape slightly .",
    "this modified spectrum is called a  diluted blackbody \" , and its temperature ( @xmath79 , i.e. , the color temperature ) is related to the actual blackbody temperature of the burning layer ( @xmath80 ) by an unknown color factor @xmath81 . consequently , the observed radius is lower than the actual radius by the square of the color factor . as a result",

    "therefore , if the best fit value of @xmath197 is less than 6 , then that must be because of the effect of the stellar spin on the spacetime , and hence can , in principle , be useful to constrain the neutron star angular momentum parameter ( see figure 1a of @xcite ) . here",
    "we note that the kerr spacetime has been assumed in the figure 1a of @xcite , while the exterior spacetime of a spinning neutron star deviates from the kerr geometry @xcite .    in   [ kilohertzquasi - periodicoscillations ]",

    "for example , @xcite suggested that the upper khz qpo frequency ( @xmath204 ) is close to the orbital frequency at the inner edge of the optically thick emission , and thus from a radius close to the @xmath196 inferred from the iron line .",
    "if this is true , then the neutron star mass ( @xmath7 ) can be measured from the relation @xmath205 ( assuming schwarzschild spacetime ; @xcite ) .",
    "broad relativistic iron line method has emerged as a way to constrain the neutron star parameters only recently .",
    "although this method has a great potential , it suffers from systematics similar to other methods .",

    "many neutron star lmxbs have two distinctly different intensity states : ( 1 ) the quiescent state in which the source remains for months to years ; and ( 2 ) the outburst state which continues for weeks to months ( sometimes for years ; e.g. , for the source ks 1731 - 260 ) .",
    "these lmxbs are called transients .",
    "the luminosity of the source typically increases by several orders of magnitude as it evolves from the quiescent state into an outburst .",
    "figure  1 of @xcite shows the long term intensity profile of such a transient 1a 1744 - 361 , exhibiting three outbursts .",
    "the transient nature of these lmxbs is normally attributed to an accretion disk instability , which causes high accretion rates for certain periods of time ( outbursts ) , and almost no accretion during other times ( quiescence ; see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "therefore during the quiescent state , the observed x - ray emission is expected to primarily originate from the neutron star surface .",
    "this emission can be detected and measured with high sensitivity imaging instruments on board _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , etc .",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) .      as mentioned in",
    "  [ whatisaquiescentemission ] , the emission from a transient neutron star lmxb in quiescence primarily comes from the neutron star s atmosphere .",
    "this atmosphere should be composed of pure hydrogen , and devoid of any x - ray spectral line ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the relatively low magnetic fields of neutron stars in lmxbs ( unlike isolated neutron stars , and stars in double neutron star binaries and hmxbs ) make the modeling simpler .",
    "therefore , assuming a blackbody emission from the neutron star surface in a quiescent lmxb , one can constrain the stellar radius using equations  [ bbrad1 ] and [ bbrad2 ] . as mentioned in ",
    "[ continuumspectrummethod ] , there may be effects of systematics in the estimated radius . during quiescence , the entire neutron star surface is expected to emit uniformly , because the stellar magnetic field is low , and there is no obvious effect which can create a significant asymmetry .",
    "therefore , the systematic uncertainty # 1 (   [ continuumspectrummethod ] ) may not be present . the source distance , which appears in equation  [ bbrad1 ] , may be known from a pre burst from the source , or in case the source is in a globular cluster ( see uncertainty # 2 ;   [ continuumspectrummethod ] ) .",
    "the surface gravitational redshift @xmath77 , which appears in equation  [ bbrad2 ] and causes the uncertainty # 3 (   [ continuumspectrummethod ] ) , may be determined from an independent measurement of the neutron star radius - to - mass ratio ( see , for example ,   [ spectrallinemethod ] ;   [ burstoscillationmethod ] ;   [ broadrelativisticironlinemethod ] ) .",
    "but , even if this ratio is not known , the neutron star @xmath17 space can still be constrained as shown in figure  [ eosr ] .",
    "the color factor @xmath81 , which appears in equation  [ bbrad2 ] and causes the uncertainty # 4 (   [ continuumspectrummethod ] ) , may be determined by theoretical calculations . however , if a theoretical atmospheric spectrum for hydrogen is used for fitting ( instead of a blackbody spectrum ) , then a separate computation of @xmath81 is not required .",
    "in fact , hydrogen atmospheric spectrum is usually used to model the quiescent emission , which can constrain the inferred radius @xmath94 of the neutron star well ( equations [ bbrad1 ] & [ bbrad2 ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the above systematics , three observational aspects make the quiescent emission method less reliable .",
    "( 1 ) the interstellar absorption cuts off a large part of the energy spectrum for some sources @xcite .",
    "this makes the correct spectral fitting difficult .",
    "one needs to measure the interstellar absorption independently ( for example , by simultaneous uv observation ) to solve this problem .",
    "( 2 ) the thermal component of the energy spectrum can vary in a timescale of months @xcite .",
    "moreover , in addition to the thermal emission , sometimes a non - thermal component is found ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this non - thermal emission may be due to a residual accretion @xcite .",
    "detailed observations of many quiescent lmxbs with _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _ and future x - ray instruments will be required to interpret the quiescent emission x - ray spectrum correctly , and hence to increase the reliability of the method .",
    "( 3 ) episodic higher accretion rates have been inferred during the quiescent emission @xcite .",
    "however , such high accretion is usually followed by a thermonuclear burst @xcite .",
    "therefore if such a burst is detected , then the data immediately prior to it can be excluded from the neutron star parameter measurement analysis .",
    "finally we note that a neutron star heats up during accretion , and cools down when the system goes into the quiescence .",
    "the cooling curve of the neutron star can be useful to understand its properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since repeated outbursts can be observed from a given transient system , the neutron star can heat up and cool down repeatedly , providing a useful tool to study the stellar core and crust .",
    "the mass @xmath7 of a neutron star affects the motion of the companion star via gravitation , and hence this mass may be constrained from the optical observations of the signatures of binary orbital motions .",
    "for example , the radial velocity ( rv ; i.e. , the orbital velocity component along the line of sight ) curve of the companion , based on , say , its absorption line spectra , can be useful to measure the binary orbital period ( @xmath206 ) and the neutron star mass function : @xmath207 here @xmath208 is the amplitude of the companion star rv , @xmath209 is the observer s inclination angle , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 is the companion mass . note that , since @xmath212 and @xmath213 , @xmath214 gives the lower limit of the neutron star mass .",
    "furthermore , with the estimated @xmath209 and @xmath215 , @xmath7 can be constrained from equation  [ massfunction1 ] .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath209 can be estimated from the observed light curves , and/or from x - ray dips / eclipses that may be detected from the lmxb ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , observations of both dips and total eclipses may imply @xmath216 @xcite .",
    "dips and eclipses also provide the binary orbital period ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the mass ratio @xmath215 of equation  [ massfunction1 ] can be estimated by measuring the rotational ( i.e. , spin - induced ) broadening of the spectral lines originated from the companion star .",
    "this is because the spin - related linear speed ( @xmath217 ) of the companion surface can be expressed in terms of @xmath215 using the following formula @xcite : @xmath218 however , if an estimate of @xmath215 is not available , then one needs to measure the companion star mass function : @xmath219)^2 } \\label{massfunction3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to constrain the neutron star mass . here",
    "@xmath220 is the amplitude of the rv of the neutron - star .",
    "unfortunately , the optical emission of a neutron star lmxb is heavily dominated by the accretion disk radiation for most sources .",
    "this optical radiation originates from the reprocessing of the x - rays in the outer accretion disk . as a result",
    ", the above mentioned binary orbital motion method can not be effectively used for the neutron star lmxbs , except for a few sources for which the companion star can be detected , and its relevant properties can be measured sufficiently well ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an example of such a system is cyg x-2 , because @xmath221% of its optical emission originates from the companion star @xcite .",
    "the transient neutron star lmxbs in their quiescent state might therefore be ideal to apply the above mentioned method ( see   [ quiescentemissions ] ) .",
    "but , at a distance of a few kpc the low - mass companion stars are usually too faint to observe , again making the binary orbital motion method ineffective .    in 2002",
    ", @xcite discovered narrow high - excitation optical emission lines from the neutron star lmxb sco x-1 .",
    "the strongest lines were in the bowen range ( @xmath222@xmath223 ) , that primarily consisted of a blend of n iii and c iii lines ( see figure  [ bowen ] ) .",
    "the n iii lines originate from a uv fluorescence process , and the c iii lines are due to photo - ionization and subsequent recombination @xcite . these lines are believed to originate from the irradiated surface of the companion star , mainly because of the following reasons : ( 1 ) the doppler tomography of bowen blend emission lines revealed a bright spot of emission ( see fig . 4 of @xcite ) ; and ( 2 ) phase - resolved spectroscopy showed that these narrow lines moved roughly in anti - phase with the neutron - star / accretion - disk component ( see figure  [ velocities ] ) . as a result",
    "these lines led to the first estimate of @xmath208 for a neutron star lmxb for which the optical emission primarily originates from the accretion disk .",
    "therefore , the discovery of @xcite and the subsequent applications of the above mentioned binary orbital motion method using the bowen blend emission lines for several sources have established a new technique to constrain the neutron star masses ( see @xcite and references therein ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this new technique , although is very promising , suffers from systematics mainly because of the unknown values of various source parameters .",
    "for example , @xmath209 and @xmath215 of equation  [ massfunction1 ] and @xmath220 of equation  [ massfunction3 ] are not known for many sources . besides",
    ", @xmath208 measured from the narrow bowen blend emission lines is only a lower - limit to the true @xmath208 , because these lines arise on the irradiated side of the companion star which does not correspond to the center of mass of the companion .",
    "this shift of the measured @xmath208 from the true @xmath208 can be accounted for by the  @xmath224-correction \" , which depends on @xmath209 , @xmath215 and the opening - angle of the accretion disk ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . among these source parameters , the uncertainty on @xmath209 and the opening - angle of the accretion disk could be reduced by modeling the accretion disk , and @xmath215 could be obtained by clearly resolving the narrow lines to determine the rotational broadening . another systematic uncertainty comes from the poorly measured systemic velocity , which is an important parameter to do doppler tomography ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "higher resolution data can be useful to reduce this uncertainty .",
    "finally , the bowen blend emission lines may also primarily originate from the gas - stream / accretion - disk impact region , rather than from the irradiated surface of the companion star , for some neutron star lmxbs @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in   [ introduction ] ( see also figure  [ eosfirst ] ) , one needs to measure at least three independent parameters of the _ same _ neutron star in order to constrain the eos models of the supranuclear core matter . because of a number of systematics ( mentioned throughout this review )",
    ", it is possible only if several measurement methods can be used for a given neutron star .",
    "this may be achieved for neutron star lmxb systems , because many of them exhibit several of the following features : thermonuclear bursts without oscillations ( suitable for continuum spectrum method ) , burst oscillations , pre bursts , mhz qpos , accretion - powered millisecond period pulsations , khz qpos , broad relativistic iron lines , quiescent emission , bowen blend emission lines , etc .",
    "for example , sax j1808.43658 has shown all these features except mhz qpos , and 4u 1636 - 536 has exhibited all these features except accretion - powered pulsations and quiescent emission .",
    "therefore , bayesian method may be used to strongly constrain the neutron star parameter values , which do not change from one observation to another ( see   [ summaryofthemethodsusingthermonuclearx - raybursts ] for a discussion ) .",
    "this is why lmxbs are useful systems to measure the neutron star parameters . in table 1",
    "we give examples of a few sources for which various methods mentioned in this review have been attempted , and in figure  [ eos_joint1 ] we demonstrate how two of these methods can be jointly used to tightly constrain the @xmath17 space .",
    "space of neutron stars with the curves corresponding to a few representative eos models ( same as figure  [ eosfirst ] ) .",
    "@xcite mentioned that the highest khz qpo frequency observed from the neutron star lmxb 4u 1636 - 536 was 1220 hz , which gives an allowed @xmath17 region for this source according to the equations [ freq4 ] and [ freq5 ] ( compare this figure with figure  [ eos_qpo ] ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite found @xmath225 for 4u 1636 - 536 by modeling the burst oscillations .",
    "the green patch shows the intesection of these two allowed regions , which should be the allowed @xmath17 space for 4u 1636 - 536 using the kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillation method (   [ kilohertzquasi - periodicoscillationmethod ] ) and the burst oscillation method (   [ burstoscillationmethod ] ) .",
    "therefore , this figure demonstrates how various methods described throughout this review can be jointly used to tightly constrain the @xmath17 space . however , note that the particular allowed @xmath17 space shown here may not be very reliable , because the actual origin of khz qpos is not yet known , and the burst oscillation measurement of @xmath226 used here suffered from systematics .",
    "[ eos_joint1],width=384 ]    there is another reason that makes neutron star lmxbs useful . in order to understand the nature of the supranuclear core matter extremely well",
    ", we will need to _ observationally _ trace out the stellar @xmath17 curve ( see , for example , @xcite ; see also figure  [ introduction ] ) .",
    "although , currently we can not do it , with the technological advancement it may be doable in the future . but this will be possible only if neutron stars have a sufficiently large range of mass values . since the neutron stars in lmxbs can accrete mass plausibly up to @xmath227 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , they should occupy a larger range in the mass space than the isolated neutron stars , and the stars in double neutron star binaries .",
    "these latter neutron stars are formed in hmxbs , and hence a limited amount of matter can be accreted because of the short life of the massive companion .",
    "in fact , @xcite found neutron star mass @xmath228 for a sample of double neutron star binaries . besides",
    ", lmxbs may contain neutron stars massive enough to rule out the softer eos models ( see   [ introduction ] ) .",
    "therefore , the lmxb systems may be intrinsically more useful than the isolated stars , and stars in double neutron star binary systems .",
    "in this review , we have described a few methods to constrain the neutron star parameters .",
    "we have chosen the methods which utilize various properties of thermonuclear bursts , accretion - powered millisecond pulsations , khz qpos , broad relativistic iron lines , quiescent emissions , and binary orbital motions .",
    "some of these phenomena provide more than one method .",
    "for example , thermonuclear burst alone provides five methods . throughout the review",
    "we have stressed that various systematic uncertainties hinder the accurate measurement of the neutron star parameters , and a joint analysis of several phenomena has a great potential to reduce these uncertainties .",
    "the large amount of archival neutron star lmxb data accumulated with the current and past x - ray space missions can be used for such a joint analysis , and this analysis can be further improved with the advanced statistical and other techniques ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these techniques may include pulsed phase spectroscopy , higher order timing analysis , and a higher capability spectral fitting recipe , which can , for example , handle the fitting of burst continuum spectra with a large number of realistic atmospheric models .",
    "however , such techniques should be complemented with theoretical investigations of the various phenomena .",
    "for example , astrophysicists and nuclear physicists should work more cohesively to understand the various properties of thermonuclear bursts .",

    "<S> measurement of at least three independent parameters , for example , mass , radius and spin frequency , of a neutron star is probably the only way to understand the nature of its supranuclear core matter . </S>",
