    "note that in our approach we use horofunctions , and indeed @xcite can be used to simplify our proofs if one assumes positive drift . recently",
    "( after the first version of this paper appeared ) , mathieu and sisto @xcite provided a different argument for positive drift in the acylindrical case .",
    "logarithmic tracking was previously known for random walks on trees , due to ledrappier @xcite , on hyperbolic groups , due to blachre , hassinsky and mathieu @xcite , and on relatively hyperbolic groups , due to sisto @xcite .",

    "to explain the argument in the proof of theorem [ theorem : convergence ] , we briefly remind the reader of the standard argument for convergence to the boundary for a random walk on a group @xmath0 acting on a locally compact @xmath2-hyperbolic space @xmath1 .",

    "in example [ ex : wedge ] , the horofunction boundary equals the gromov boundary as a set , but the topology is different : namely , any sequence of horofunctions @xmath81 corresponding to a sequence of points @xmath82 which leaves every compact set converges to the horofunction @xmath83 associated to the basepoint @xmath27 .    the gromov boundary may be recovered from the horofunction boundary by identifying functions which differ by a bounded amount , but in general the horofunction boundary may be larger than the gromov boundary , and is not a quasi - isometry invariant of the space .",

    "we shall distinguish two different types of horofunctions .",
    "we say a horofunction @xmath91 is _ finite _ if @xmath92 , and is _ infinite _ if @xmath93 .",

    "in this section we provide a proof of proposition [ prop : hyperbolic ] , which estimates the translation length in terms of the distance an isometry moves the basepoint , and the gromov product .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath926 , which depends only on @xmath2 , such that the following holds . for any isometry @xmath37 of a @xmath2-hyperbolic space @xmath1 , if @xmath37 satisfies the inequality @xmath1100 then the translation length of @xmath37 is @xmath1101    we start by showing that if @xmath29 is a geodesic segment from @xmath27 to @xmath1102 , then @xmath1103 is contained in a bounded neighbourhood of @xmath29 , for all @xmath1104 .",
    "we shall write @xmath279 for @xmath1103 . note that , since the action is isometric , we have for each @xmath280 @xmath1105      let @xmath1107 be a nearest point on @xmath29 to @xmath279 , and let @xmath279 be an element of @xmath1108 furthest from @xmath29 .",
    "consider the quadrilateral formed by @xmath1109 and @xmath1110 , as illustrated below in figure [ pic : bounded neighbourhood ] .",
    "let @xmath145 be a nearest point to @xmath279 on a geodesic segment from @xmath1117 to @xmath1118 . by the estimate for the gromov product in terms of distance to a geodesic ,",
    "@xmath1119 ) + o(\\delta),\\ ] ] and as @xmath37 is an isometry , this implies that @xmath1120 by thin triangles , the point @xmath145 lies within distance @xmath1121 of at least one of the other three sides of the quadrilateral .",
    "suppose @xmath145 lies within @xmath1121 of a geodesic from @xmath1117 to @xmath1110 .",
    "since @xmath279 is the furthest point from the geodesic @xmath29 , we have @xmath1122 , and since @xmath145 lies in a @xmath1123-neighbourhood of the geodesic from @xmath1117 to @xmath1110 , we have @xmath1124    on the other hand , if we now assume and apply the reverse triangle inequality , we get @xmath1125 hence @xmath1126 which contradicts if @xmath821 is large enough ( depending only on @xmath2 ) .",
    "the same argument applies if @xmath145 lies within @xmath1121 of a geodesic from @xmath1118 to @xmath1127 .",
    "therefore , @xmath145 lies within @xmath1128 of @xmath29 , and so @xmath1129 , as required .",
    "consider a triple of consecutive points , @xmath1131 and @xmath1132 .",
    "if their corresponding nearest point projections @xmath1133 and @xmath1134 to @xmath29 do not lie in the same order , then using proposition [ prop : npp2 ] repeatedly one gets , if @xmath1134 lies in between @xmath1107 and @xmath1127 , the equality @xmath1135 which , using and , implies @xmath1136 which contradicts if @xmath821 is large enough .",
    "the case where @xmath1127 lies between @xmath1107 and @xmath1134 is completely analogous , therefore the @xmath1107 are monotonically ordered on @xmath29 , and so by @xmath1137 which implies , by proposition [ prop : npp2 ] , a similar bound for @xmath1138 , and so in fact @xmath1139 is quasi - geodesic , with @xmath1140 .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath36 follows from the triangle inequality ; indeed , for each @xmath147 one has @xmath1141 and the desired bound follows by taking as @xmath44 the midpoint of the geodesic segment between @xmath27 and @xmath393 , completing the proof of proposition [ prop : hyperbolic ] ."
