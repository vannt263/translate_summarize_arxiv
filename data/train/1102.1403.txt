    "the motivation for colliding heavy ions at facilities like the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern is to form a state of matter called the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "each of these collisions deposit many tev of energy into a region roughly the size of the colliding nuclei .",
    "that region is so hot and dense that quarks and gluons become the relevant degrees of freedom instead of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "this qgp existed when the universe was less than a microsecond old , and still extremely hot and dense .",
    "two - particle correlations measured at rhic reveal features unique to nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite .",
    "pair densities are commonly measured as a function of the azimuthal angle and pseudo - rapidity difference between the particles ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively ) .",
    "while two - particle correlations in p+p and d+au collisions show a narrow peak centered at @xmath2 and @xmath4 , the near - angle peak in au+au collisions broadens longitudinally and narrows in azimuth relative to p+p collisions .",
    "an analysis of the width of the peak for particles of all transverse momentum @xmath5 finds the correlation extends across nearly two units of pseudo - rapidity  @xcite .",
    "when selecting higher @xmath5 particles ( _ e.g. _ @xmath6  gev / c ) , the correlation extends beyond the acceptance of the star detector ( @xmath7 ) and perhaps as far as @xmath8 as indicated by phobos data  @xcite .",
    "this feature is known as the ridge .",
    "star data shows that the ridge amplitude rises rapidly with collision centrality  @xcite before reaching a maximum and falling off in the most central bins .",
    "the drop is often ignored . in this letter we present an explanation for the centrality dependence of the ridge amplitude related to density inhomogeneities in the initial overlap region .",
    "we use measurements of the second harmonic momentum - space anisotropy @xmath9 and single particle rapidity density @xmath10 along with a monte - carlo glauber model  @xcite for the initial density to predict the amplitude ( @xmath11 ) of the near - side ridge correlation as a function of centrality for @xmath12 gev , 200 gev , and 2.76 tev .",
    "a successful description of @xmath11 is noteworthy , because it demonstrates that the correlations measured in heavy - ion collisions represent an image of structures such as flux - tubes  @xcite in the initial overlap of heavy ion collisions of the order of @xmath13 m in size .    in glauber monte - carlo models  @xcite the density distribution in the initial collision region",
    "is assumed to be determined by the positions of the nucleons participating in the interactions ( participants ) . for a typical collision",
    ", the shape of the overlap region will be predominantly an ellipse .",
    "the eccentricity of the ellipse can be quantified as @xmath14 .",
    "interactions amongsts the systems constituents can convert that elliptic shape from coordinate - space into momentum - space leading to a large second fourier component in the momentum - space distribution _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the azimuth angle of particles emitted from the collision and @xmath17 is the reaction plane angle defined by the vector connecting the centers of the two colliding nuclei .",
    "there are a finite number of participants in each collision so there will be event - to - event fluctuations in the density distributions that lead to fluctuations in the initial eccentricity as well as a tilt of the elliptic shape of the overlap region away from @xmath17 . the plane containing the titled axis and beam axis",
    "is called participant plane , and the eccentricity calculated relative to that axis is called the participant eccentricity @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 is a positive definite quantity so it can lead to non - zero @xmath9 even for head - on collisions .",
    "fluctuations in @xmath18 can lead to fluctuations in @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "it was argued previously that eccentricity fluctuations can give rise to @xmath19 fluctuations for more harmonics than just @xmath20  @xcite , and that those fluctuations could therefore be the source of the near - side ridge  @xcite ( especially if the @xmath19 fluctuations depend on @xmath3 _ i.e. _ @xmath21 ) .",
    "subsequent calculations from several groups  @xcite support this . to test this conjecture",
    ", we calculate the centrality dependence of the near - side ridge amplitude @xmath11 from eccentricity fluctuations .",
    "we base our calculations on three premises : 1 ) the expansion of the fireball in heavy - ion collisions converts anisotropies from coordinate - space into momentum - space , 2 ) the conversion efficiency increases with density , and 3 ) the relevant expansion plane is the participant plane .",
    "the participant plane can be defined for any harmonic number .",
    "a system with a lumpy initial energy density will lead to finite participant eccentricity at several harmonics  @xcite ; eccentricity can be thought of as a harmonic decomposition of the azimuthal dependence of the initial density . to illustrate how eccentricity fluctuations can lead to a ridge - like structure in particle correltions , using the definition in ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate @xmath22 for all harmonics .",
    "[ f1 ] ( a ) shows the @xmath23-harmonic participant eccentricity @xmath24 for central au+au collisions from our monte - carlo glauber model . typically the participant eccentricity is calculated based on the positions of point - like participants ( _ i.e. _ the participant is said to exist at a precise @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "one can also calculate the eccentricity from a more realistic model with participants smeared over some region .",
    "this is done by treating each participant as many points distributed within a disk of radius @xmath27 .",
    "the figure shows @xmath24 for @xmath28 and 4 fm . increasing @xmath27 washes out the higher @xmath24 terms .",
    "the dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath29 is well fit with a gaussian @xmath30 for all values of @xmath27 with the width of the gaussian @xmath31 narrowing as @xmath27 is increased .",
    "here we ve introduced the length scale @xmath27 causing the higher terms in @xmath24 to be washed out .",
    "that effect is more general though and we believe it is important for understanding correlations and @xmath19 fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "one can also consider what happens when particles free - stream for some amount of time @xmath32 before they interact ; which also introduces a length scale @xmath33 leading to a reduction of higher terms  @xcite .",
    "the mean - free - path ( @xmath34 ) a particle travels between interactions in the fireball also affects the ability of the fireball to convert higher @xmath24 terms into @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34 will prevent higher @xmath24 terms from being converted into @xmath35 .",
    "the acoustic horizon may also play an important role  @xcite . in our calculations",
    ", we study the effect of varying @xmath27 with the understanding that many length - scales , like @xmath34 and @xmath33 , will contribute to the final dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath35 is related to the two - particle correlations @xmath36 by a fourier transform .",
    "if @xmath35 _ vs. _ @xmath29 has a gaussian shape then @xmath36 will also have a gaussian peak at @xmath37 .",
    "[ f1 ] ( a ) shows that @xmath24 follows a gaussian so that eccentricity fluctuations should lead to a near - side gaussian with a width depending on the length scales in the system .",
    "fig  [ f1 ] ( b ) shows the shape of the two - particle correlations from @xmath24 . for @xmath38 , @xmath39 since @xmath24 is calculated in the center - of - mass frame of the participants .",
    "this leads to a gaussian centered at @xmath37 and an apparent negative @xmath40 term due to the suppression of the @xmath38 eccentricity fluctuations .",
    "the negative @xmath40 is seen in the data to follow the same centrality dependence as the nearside gaussian  @xcite .",
    "the fact provides evidence that both the nearside gaussian and the awayside negative @xmath40 terms are related to initial density fluctuations .",
    "we fit the correlations in panel ( b ) with a gaussian of width @xmath41 and a @xmath40 term . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ( c ) we plot @xmath31 ( scaled by 1/5 for clarity ) and @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is fit with a power law @xmath43 and @xmath41 is described the inverse .",
    "increasing length scales in the system should lead to a broadening of the azimuthal width of the near - side gaussian .",
    "having demonstrated that it is natural for eccentricity fluctuations to lead to a ridge like correlation with a width dependent on the length scales in the system , we now consider the amplitude of the ridge .",
    "the ridge amplitude @xmath11 is found from data by fitting @xmath44 ( the pair density @xmath45 minus the reference pair density @xmath46 scaled by @xmath47 ) _ vs. _ @xmath2 and @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the fit function has @xmath3 independent @xmath40 and @xmath48 terms , and a near - side 2-d gaussian with amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "we work with the conjecture that the 2-d gaussian is a manifestation of @xmath24 and calculate the centrality dependence of @xmath11 .",
    "our result for @xmath11 will be related to @xmath35 so we need to know the transfer function or conversion efficiency @xmath49  @xcite of @xmath24 into @xmath35 .",
    "we expect @xmath49 to depend on particle density . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] we show the two - particle cumulant scaled by eccentricity @xmath50 _ vs. _ density @xmath51 from rhic and lhc  @xcite .",

    "@xcite fits the full range of rhic and lhc data reasonably well providing our estimate of @xmath52 .",
    "we can estimate @xmath11 independently from the fluctuations of several different harmonics .",
    "since a @xmath48 term proportional to @xmath53 is used in the fit to @xmath44  @xcite we base our estimate of @xmath20 component of @xmath11 on the difference between @xmath54 and @xmath53 .",
    "we can also calculate the @xmath55 component from @xmath56 alone but this requires an assumption about @xmath57 which is not yet measured .",
    "we need to convert our prediction for correlations from a particular harmonic into a gaussian amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "for @xmath20 we find @xmath58 with the @xmath55 component similary giving @xmath59 .",
    "the azimuthal width @xmath41 of the near - side gaussian is weakly dependent on centrality so we use a typical value of @xmath60 . to relate @xmath35 to @xmath44 we need to include the particle density @xmath61  @xcite . combining @xmath62 with the conversion efficiency @xmath52 , particle density @xmath63 , and factor of 0.11 we find @xmath64 .",
    "we take @xmath63 from data , @xmath52 from fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 from our monte - carlo glauber model .",
    "the @xmath55 based prediction does not need @xmath66 but does require the conversion efficiency @xmath57 .",
    "we assume that @xmath57 has the same density dependence as @xmath52 but that various length scales in the system will suppress @xmath57 relative to @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath67 gives good agreement between the @xmath20 and @xmath55 estimates and is consistent with the ampt results in ref .",
    "@xcite . from @xmath55",
    "we find @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "[ f3 ] shows our estimate of the ridge amplitude @xmath11 based on @xmath24 _ vs. _ centrality parameter @xmath70 for au+au collisions at 62.4 and 200 gev and for pb+pb collisions at 2.76 tev . @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions and the number of participants .",
    "more central or higher energy collisions yield larger values of @xmath73 .",
    "the open ( closed ) symbols show the @xmath55 ( @xmath20 ) estimates .",
    "we find that our estimate of @xmath11 agrees with what has been observed at 200 and 62.4 gev .",
    "our @xmath11 , like the data , starts at a small value and rises much faster than expectations from a linear superposition of independent p+p collisions ( shown for 200 gev in the fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) which assumes that correlations grow as @xmath74 .",
    "the rise continues until @xmath11 reaches a maximum of 0.7 for 200 gev near @xmath75 , then falls again .",
    "the 2.76 tev calculations show a similar trend as the 200 and 62.4 gev calculations but the amplitude is expected to be much larger .",
    "this provides a testable prediction for the lhc experiments .",
    "our picture provides a natural explanation for the rise and fall related to the initial overlap geometry and its fluctuations . for the @xmath55 term for example",
    ", @xmath76 falls with @xmath72 since the larger @xmath72 leads to smaller fluctuations .",
    "but @xmath77 first rises then falls ( see fig .",
    "this rise and fall is due to the almond shaped geometry of the overlap region which leads to non - statistical fluctuations in @xmath78 for more than just the @xmath20 harmonic  @xcite .",
    "[ f4 ] shows @xmath79 for @xmath55 , 5 , 7 , 9 , and 23 . for harmonics close to @xmath20 ,",
    "the almond shape of the overlap zone causes large deviations from a trivial @xmath80 behavior .",
    "the higher harmonics approach this statistical expectation with @xmath81 , nearly reaching a @xmath82 behavior .",
    "both @xmath49 and @xmath63 are increasing with centrality but the product of @xmath83 rises until very central collisions and then falls .",
    "the drop fall in central is due to the subsidence of the effect of the almond shape of the overlap geometry .",
    "the observation that the rise and fall exists in the near - side ridge amplitude shows that the ridge is dominated by initial geometry fluctuations ; even exhibiting a dependence on the coupling of various harmonics to the intrinsic almond shape of the overlap region .",
    "we know of no other plausible scenarios to explain the rise and fall of the ridge other than this explanation .",
    "this rise and fall is to our knowledge a unique signature of density fluctuations .",
    "this implies that momentum - space correlations are sensitive to initial density fluctuations and that correlations in heavy - ion collisions provide an image of the density distributions in the initial overlap zone .",
    "the system created in these collisions acts as a femtoscope , revealing structures with length scales on the order of a fm .",
    "our explanation for the centrality dependence of @xmath11 provides a natural explanation for the rise and fall of the ridge .",
    "our estimates of the amplitude agree with rhic data suggesting that the conversion of geometry fluctuations in the initial overlap region into momentum space causes the near - side ridge structure .",
    "we expect the conversion efficiency to drop with @xmath29 since effects like initial - state free - streaming and mean - free - path will wash out the higher harmonic terms . extracting the conversion efficiency @xmath84 as a function of @xmath29  @xcite , centrality , and particle kinematics will provide information on those effects .",
    "this only relies on measuring the two - particle cumulant @xmath85 which is a rather simple experimental measurement and comparing it to the initial eccentricities from various models of the initial density .",
    "it will be particularly interesting to determine @xmath49 as a function of @xmath3 to understand how de - coherence affects manifest in the longitudinal direction .",
    "we presented the participant eccentricity _ vs. _ harmonic when the participants are treated as point - like or smeared over a radius @xmath27 .",
    "the larger values of @xmath27 wash out the higher harmonic eccentricities .",
    "we argued that , similarly , a large mean - free - path or acoustic horizon should also wash out higher harmonics of @xmath19 .",
    "such an effect could lead to a gaussian peak in two - particle correlations at @xmath37 similar to that seen in the data .",
    "we calculated the contribution to the near - side gaussian peak that we expect from initial density fluctuations .",
    "following simple premises , we find that the near - side peak from density fluctuations should rise rapidly , reach a maximum just before the most central events , then fall .",
    "our estimate of the magnitude is in agreement within our uncertainties with the available data and the shape matches the data .",
    "this is the only calculation we know of to correctly describe the rise and fall of the ridge amplitude .",
    "our calculation shows that the rise and fall is related to the interaction of fluctuations with the shape of the initial overlap geometry .",
    "we conclude therefore that density fluctuations are the dominant source for the ridge - like correlations .",
    "the longitudinal width of the ridge remains an interesting topic to investigate .",
    "finally we use the same framework to predict the ridge amplitude for 2.76 tev pb+pb collisions .",
