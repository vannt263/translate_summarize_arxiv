    "in high energy hadron - hadron collisions the momentum spectra of outgoing particles which have the same quantum numbers as the incoming particles , also called leading particle ( lp ) spectra , have been measured already some time ago @xcite .",
    "recently new data on pion - proton collisions were released by the ehs / na22 collaboration @xcite in which the spectra of both outcoming leading particles , the pion and the proton , were simultaneously measured .",
    "very recently data on leading protons produced in eletron - proton reactions at hera with a c.m.s .",
    "energy one order of magnitude higher than in the other above mentioned hadronic experiments became available @xcite . in the case of photoproduction data",
    "can be interpreted in terms of the vector dominance model @xcite and can therefore be considered as data on lp production in vector meson - proton collisions .",
    "these new measurements of lp spectra both in hadron - hadron and in eletron - proton collisions have renewed the interest on the subject , specially because the latter are measured at higher energies and therefore the energy dependence of the lp spectra can now be determined .",
    "it is important to have a very good understanding of these spectra for a number of reasons .",
    "they are the input for calculations of the lp spectra in hadron - nucleus collisions , which are a fundamental tool in the description of atmospheric cascades initiated by cosmic radiation @xcite .",
    "there are several new projects in cosmic ray physics including the high resolution fly s eye project , the telescope array project and the pierre auger project @xcite for which a precise knowledge of energy flow ( lp spectra and inelasticity distributions ) in very high energy collisions would be very usefull .    in a very different scenario , namely in high energy heavy ion collisions at rhic",
    ", it is very important to know where the outgoing ( leading ) baryons are located in momentum space .",
    "if the stopping is large they will stay in the central rapidity region and affect the dynamics there , generating , for example , a baryon rich equation of state .",
    "alternatively , if they populate the fragmentation region , the central ( and presumably hot and dense ) region will be dominated by mesonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the composition of the dense matter is therefore relevant for the study of quark gluon plasma formation @xcite .    in any case , before modelling @xmath0 or @xmath1 collisions one has to understand properly hadron - hadron processes .",
    "the lp spectra are also interesting for the study of diffractive reactions , which dominate the large @xmath2 region .",
    "since lp spectra are measured in reactions with low momentum transfer and go up to large @xmath2 values , it is clear that the processes in question occur in the non - perturbative domain of qcd .",
    "one needs then `` qcd inspired '' models and the most popular are string models , like fritiof , venus or the quark gluon string model ( qgsm ) .",
    "calculation of lp spectra involving these models can be found in refs . @xcite and @xcite .    in the framework of the qcd parton model of high energy collisions ,",
    "leading particles originate from the emerging fast partons of the collision debris .",
    "there is a large rapidity separation between fast partons and sea partons .",
    "fast partons interact rarely with the surrounding wee partons .",
    "the interaction between the hadron projectile and the target is primarily through wee parton clouds .",
    "a fast parton or a coherent configuration of fast partons may therefore filter through essentially unaltered . based on these observations and aiming to study @xmath0 collisons , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite proposed a mechanism for lp production in which the lp spectrum is given by the convolution of the parton momentum distribution in the projectile hadron with its corresponding fragmentation function into a final leading hadron .",
    "this independent fragmentation scheme is , however , not supported by leading charm production in pion - nucleus scattering .",
    "it fails specially in describing the @xmath3 asymmetry .",
    "a number of models addressed these data and the conclusion was that valence quark recombination is needed . translated to leading pion or proton production this means that what happens is rather a coalescence of valence quarks to form the lp and not an independent fragmentation of a quark or diquark to a pion or a nucleon .",
    "another point is that the coherent configuration formed by the valence quarks may go through the target but , due to the strong stopping of the gluon clouds , may be significantly decelerated . this correlation between central energy deposition due to gluons and",
    "leading particle spectra was shown to be essential for the undertanding of leading charm production @xcite .    in this work",
    "we follow the same general ideas of ref . @xcite but with a different implementation .",
    "in particular we replace independent fragmentation by valence quark recombination and free leading parton flow by deceleration due to `` gluon stripping '' .",
    "these ideas are incorporated in the model employed by us , the interacting gluon model ( igm ) , which has been used to study energy flow in non - diffractive reactions @xcite and has been recently extended to diffractive processes @xcite and also applied to the recent hera ( photoproduction ) data both on diffractive mass distributions @xcite and leading @xmath4 spectra @xcite .",
    "we shall study all measured lp spectra including those measured at hera .",
    "we will find and comment universal aspects in the energy flow pattern of all these reactions .",
    "universality means , in the context of the igm , that the underlying dynamics is the same both in diffractive and non - diffractive lp production and both in hadron - hadron and photon - hadron processes .",
    "the interacting gluon model ( igm ) was introduced some time ago @xcite and developed by us recently @xcite and proved out to be quite usefull for the study of energy flow .",
    "since the model has been extensively discussed in our previous papers we shall present here only the basic ideas and a few formulas leaving the more detailed discussion to the appendix .",
    "the main aspect of the igm , shared with minijet models such as hijing @xcite , is the assumption that hadron - hadron reactions are dominated by multiple and incoherent parton - parton scatterings . among these ,",
    "gluon - gluon scatterings are the most important . at very high energies and large scales",
    "this is a very good approximation . at not very large energies and lower scales one is already moving towards the non - perturbative domain and dealing with soft gluons and",
    "the incoherence hypothesis might not be valid .",
    "the soft gluons involved in the collisions studied here are partly pre - existing inside the hadron and partly produced by radiation .",
    "pre - existing soft gluons exhibit the same properties as those studied in lattice qcd simulations in the strong coupling regime .",
    "according to di giacomo and collaborators @xcite , the typical correlation length of the soft gluon fields is around @xmath5 .",
    "since this length is still much smaller than the typical hadron size , the gluon fields can , in a first approximation , be treated as uncorrelated . as a consequence @xcite the number of ( soft ) gluon - gluon collisions will follow a poissonian distribution , which was also used in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the case of radiated soft gluons",
    ", it was recently shown in @xcite that gluons produced with small transverse momenta are independently emitted from the radiating parton , as qcd coherence supresses their showering .",
    "consequently , the multiplicity of low @xmath6 gluons follows a poisson distribution , suggesting that the collision number follows a poisson distribution as well .",
    "these facts indicate that in the region where perturbative results break down , the independent collision approximation may still be a reasonable one . from the practical point of view , it was shown in @xcite that replacing the poissonian distribution by a broader one does not affect the results significantly as long as some mass scale is introduced to cut off the very low @xmath7 region .    in the igm",
    "the two colliding hadrons are represented by valence quarks carrying their quantum numbers ( charges ) plus the accompanying clouds of gluons ( which represent also the sea @xmath8 pairs and therefore should be regarded as effective gluons ) . in the course of a collision gluonic clouds interact strongly and form a gluonic _ central fireball _",
    "( cf ) located in the central region of the reaction .",
    "the valence quarks ( plus those gluons which did not interact ) get excited and form _ leading jets _ ( lj s ) ( or _ beam jets _ ) which then populate mainly the fragmentation regions of the reaction .",
    "the valence quarks are therefore spectators and the bulk of the reaction and energy deposition occurs because of the gluon - gluon collisions , whose number is poisson distributed with the mean value given by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 s denote the effective number of gluons from the corresponding projectiles ( approximated by the respective gluonic structure functions ) and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the gluon - gluon and hadron - hadron cross sections , respectively . in the above expression @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the fractional momenta of two gluons coming from the projectile and from the target whereas @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 being the mass of lightest produced state and @xmath17 the total c.m.s .",
    "each gluon - gluon collision produces a minifireball ( mf ) .",
    "depending on the energy many @xmath18 collisions may happen and energy fractions @xmath19 and @xmath20 from the target and projectile may be deposited in the central region . the probability for depositing the energy fractions @xmath7 and @xmath21 can be analitically computed in the igm and is given by the function @xmath22 derived in the appendix .",
    "leading particles can also be diffractively produced . in the igm diffractive dissociation ( dd ) can be included in a simple way , by just requiring that one of the colliding hadrons looses only a very small fraction of its initial energy momentum .",
    "this was done by imposing cuts on the first moments of the @xmath23 function @xcite . in our earlier calculations of energy flow with the igm",
    "we were not concerned with the fragmentation region .",
    "the main interest was the energy deposition in the central region , which is highly relevant for quark gluon plasma physics .",
    "therefore our first lp spectra were in reasonable agreement with data but in the region @xmath24 the model prediction was below the experimental points because we had no diffractive component whereras data did not discriminate between diffractive and non - diffractive events . later on we have included diffraction in the igm @xcite .",
    "the resulting picture is the same as for non - diffractive events , except that in dd the gluon cloud of the projectile interacts only with a subset of the target gluon cloud , which carries a small momentum fraction and which we call `` pomeron '' ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "our pomeron is essentially just a kinematical restriction which forces one of the colliding hadrons to loose only a very small ammount of its energy . using the diffractive igm",
    "we have obtained a good description of the diffractive mass spectra in hadronic diffractive collisions @xcite and also in photon - proton collisions @xcite . although it is possible to reformulate the model in the impact parameter space and associate diffractive events with peripheral collisions , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we prefer here to explore further the kinematical interpretation of diffraction .",
    "moreover , in the present formulation we correctly reproduce the diffractive peak , which was not obtained in ref .",
    "apart from the recent ehs / na22 and hera lp spectra , a new experiment now under consideration at fermilab will , among other things , address the question of leading particles and dd component in the near future @xcite . in view of these facts",
    "we shall recalculate lp spectra in our model with a dd component properly included and extend it to @xmath26 collisions .",
    "in the igm a typical non - diffractive event is shown in figure 1a ) . colliding particles loose energy fractions @xmath7 and @xmath21 , forming leading particles with @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in the figure",
    ", @xmath29 stands for vector meson , used later for photoproduction at hera .",

    "it should be of the order of the ratio between the total diffractive and total inelastic ( including dd processes ) cross sections , @xmath62 .",
    "it can , however , differ from that ratio due to the different experimental acceptance of dd and non - dd events not considered here .",
    "this fact makes @xmath43 a free parameter of the model .",

    "this is still a relatively moderate variation in the energy . since we do not address diffraction at the @xmath64 ( energies of 200 - @xmath65 ) nor at the tevatron ( energy of @xmath66 ) we keep our fraction of diffractive events as a constant",
    "this quantity is the only free parameter in this paper .",
    "the spectral functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the same as in @xcite and @xcite for non - diffractive and for diffractive processes , respectively .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details concerning the exact values and character of the relevant parameters which were fixed from other previous applications of the igm . in the case of diffractive hadron - proton scattering the function @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega1 ] ) represents the momentum distribution of the gluons belonging to the proton subset called pomeron and @xmath21 is the momentum fraction _ of the proton _ carried by one of these gluons .",
    "we shall therefore use the notation @xmath70 .",
    "this function should not be confused with the momentum distribution of the gluons inside the pomeron , @xmath71 ( see below ) .",
    "the moments @xmath72 ( we only require @xmath73 ) are the only places where dynamical quantities like the gluonic and hadronic cross sections appear in the igm . in dd",
    "we are selecting a special class of events and therefore we must choose the correct dynamical inputs in the present situation , namely @xmath74 and the hadronic cross section @xmath12 appearing in @xmath68 .",
    "as already mentioned , the pomeron for us is just a collection of gluons which form a color singlet and belong to the diffracted hadron . in early works we have assumed that these gluons behave like all other ordinary gluons in the proton and have therefore the same momentum distribution .",
    "the only difference is the momentum sum rule , which for the gluons in @xmath25 is @xmath75 where @xmath76 ( see @xcite and below ) instead of @xmath77 , which holds for the entire gluon population in the proton .    in principle , since the pomeron can not be considered an ordinary particle , one can not define precisely a momentum sum rule in the usual sense @xcite . nevertheless , in our definition , the pomeron is really just a collection of gluons . as such ,",
    "when emitted , it carries a momentum fraction , @xmath78 , of the parent proton . of course",
    ", @xmath78 can fluctuate .",
    "in the calculations , it always appears divided by the pomeron - proton cross section , which is another poorly known and fluctuating quantity .",
    "taking all these fluctuations into account would just introduce more freedom in the model and make calculations more complicated .",
    "we avoid it in this paper as we also avoid other sources of fluctuations like impact parameter fluctuations . in ref .",
    "@xcite impact parameter fluctuations were introduced in the non- diffractive igm and the result was , as expected , a smearing of the original curves . the overall effect , however , was not very big .",
    "we expect the same to be true for the fluctuations in the pomeron sum rule .    in @xcite",
    "we have treated the pomeron structure in more detail and addressed the question of its `` hardness '' or `` softness '' . in order to make contact with the analysis performed by hera experimental groups we have considered two possible momentum distributions for the gluons inside @xmath25 , one hard , @xmath79 and the other soft @xmath80 . following the ( standard ) notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath81 is the momentum fraction of the pomeron carried by the gluons and the superscripts @xmath82 and @xmath83 denote `` hard '' and `` soft '' respectively . using a standard choice for the pomeron flux factor , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the pomeron and noticing that @xmath86 , the distribution @xmath74 needed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega1 ] ) is then given by the convolution : @xmath87    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have also used @xmath88 , the same expression already used by us before in ref . @xcite .",
    "as it was shown , this choice corresponds to an intermediate between `` soft '' and `` hard '' pomeron and it shall be used here .",
    "one of the most interesting conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite was that it is possible to learn something about the pomeron profile studying the diffractive mass spectra .",
    "moreover , our analysis suggests that the `` soft '' pomeron is in conflict with these data . only with a very unusual choice of parameters",
    "a good agreement could be recovered .",
    "considering the large ammount of data already described previously by the igm , this choice was extreme and we concluded therefore that the `` soft '' pomeron is disfavoured . the same conclusion was found in refs .",
    "the fraction of diffracted nucleon momentum , @xmath78 , allocated specifically to the @xmath25 gluonic cluster and the hadronic cross section @xmath12 are both unknown .",
    "however , they always appear in @xmath23 as a ratio ( @xmath89 ) of parameters and different choices are possible .",
    "just in order to make use of the present knowledge about the pomeron , we shall choose @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 and @xmath93 are parameters fixed from our previous @xcite systematic data analysis .",
    "as it can be seen , @xmath94 turns out to be a very slowly varying function of @xmath17 assuming values between 2.6 and @xmath95 , which is a well accepted value for the pomeron - proton cross section , and @xmath96 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as it will be seen , a good undertanding of the systematics of lp production can be obtained in terms of the dynamical inputs contained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega1 ] ) . with the exception of @xmath43",
    "all parameters are fixed . in the next section",
    "we compare our results given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lps ] ) with experimental data .",
    "in figs . 2a ) , 2b ) and 2c ) we present our spectra of leading protons , pions and kaons respectively .",
    "the dashed lines show the contribution of non - diffractive lp production and the solid lines show the effect of adding a non - diffractive component .",
    "all parameters were fixed previously and the only one to be fixed was @xmath43 . for simplicity",
    "we have neglected the second diagram in fig . 1 , because it gives a curve which is very similar in shape to the non - diffractive curve .",
    "in contrast , the pomeron emission by the projectile ( fig .",
    "1c ) produces the diffractive peak .",
    "we have then chosen @xmath97 and @xmath98 in all collision types . as expected , the inclusion of the diffractive component flattens considerably the final lp distribution bringing it to a good agreement with the available experimental data @xcite . in our model",
    "there is some room for changes leading to fits with better quality .",
    "we could , for example , use a prescription for hadronization ( as we did before in @xcite ) ) giving a more important role to it , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in doing this , however , we loose simplicity and the transparency of the physical picture , which are the advantages of the igm .",
    "we prefer to keep simplicity and concentrate on the interpretation of our results . in first place",
    "it is interesting to observe the good agreement between our curve and data for protons ( fig .",
    "1a ) in the low @xmath7 region .",
    "the observed protons could have been also centrally produced , i.e. , they could come from the cf .",
    "however we fit data without the cf contribution .",
    "this suggests , as expected , that all the protons in this @xmath7 range are leading , i.e. , they come from valence quark recombination . in figs .",
    "1b ) and 1c ) we observe an excess at low @xmath7 .",
    "this is so because pions and kaons are light they can more easily be created from the sea ( centrally produced ) .",
    "our distributions come only from the leading jet ( lj ) and consequently pass below the data points .",
    "a closer look into the three dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 shows that pion and kaon spectra are softer than the proton one .",
    "the former peak at @xmath99 while the latter peaks at @xmath100 . in the igm",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the energy fraction that goes to the central fireball , @xmath101 , is controled by the behaviour of the function @xmath102 , which is approximately a double gaussian in the variables @xmath7 and @xmath21 , as it can be seen in expression ( [ eq : chind ] ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath103 and @xmath104 play the role of central values of this gaussian .",
    "consequently when @xmath103 or @xmath104 increases , this means that the energy deposition from the upper or lower leg ( in fig .",
    "1 ) increases respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the moments of the @xmath23 function and are directly proportional to the gluon distribution functions in the projectile and target and inversely proportional to the target - projectile inelastic cross section . in the calculations , there are two changes when we go from @xmath105 to @xmath106 :    * the first is that we replace @xmath107 by @xmath108 which is smaller .",
    "this leads to an overall increase of the energy deposition .",
    "there are some indications that this is really the case and the inelasticity in @xmath106 is larger than in @xmath105 collisions @xcite .",
    "* the second and most interesting and important change is that we replace one gluon distribution in the proton @xmath109 by the corresponding distribution in the pion @xmath110 .",
    "we know that @xmath111 whereas @xmath112 , i.e. , that gluons in pions are harder than in protons .",
    "this introduces an asymmetry in the moments @xmath103 and @xmath104 , making the latter significantly larger .    as a consequence ,",
    "pions will be more stopped and will emerge from the collision with a softer @xmath7 spectrum .",
    "this can already be seen in the data points of fig .",
    "2 . however since these points contain particles produced by other mechanisms , such as central and diffractive production , it is not yet possible to draw firm conclusions .",
    "the analysis of the moments @xmath103 and @xmath104 can also be done for the diffractive process shown in fig .",
    "because of the cuts in the integrations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : momd ] ) , they will depend on @xmath113 .",
    "we calculate them for @xmath114 and @xmath115 reactions . for low @xmath40",
    "they assume very similar values as in the non - diffractive case .",
    "for large @xmath40 however we find that @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the reason for these approximate equalities is that in diffractive processes we cut the large @xmath14 region and this is precisely where the pion and the proton would differ , since only for large @xmath21 are @xmath118 and @xmath119 significantly different . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that the introduction of the above metioned cuts drastically reduces the energy ( @xmath17 ) dependence of the diffractive mass distributions leading , in particular , to the approximate @xmath120 behaviour for all values of @xmath17 from isr to tevatron energies . here",
    "these cuts produce another type of scaling , which may be called `` projectile scaling '' or `` projectile universality of the diffractive peak '' and which means that for large enough @xmath40 the diffractive peak is the same for all projectiles .",
    "the corresponding @xmath121 functions will be the same for protons and pions in this region .",
    "the cross section appearing in the denominator of the moments will , in this case , be the same , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
    "the only remaining difference between them , their different gluonic distributions , is in this region cut off .",
    "this may be regarded as a prediction of the igm .",
    "experimentally this may be difficult to check since one would need a large number of points in large @xmath40 region of the leading particle spectrum .",
    "data plotted in fig .",
    "2 neither prove nor disprove this conjecture .",
    "the discrepancy observed in the proton spectrum is only due to our choice of normalization of the diffractive and non - diffractive curves .",
    "the peak shapes are similar .    the ehs / na22 collaboration provided us with data on @xmath33 reactions . in particular they present the @xmath7 distributions of both leading particles , the pion and the proton .",
    "their points for pions and protons are shown in fig .",
    "3a ) and 3b ) respectively .",
    "these points are presumably free from diffractive dissociation .",
    "the above mentioned asymmetry in pion and proton energy loss emerges clearly , the pions being much slower . the proton distribution peaks at @xmath123 .",
    "our curves ( solid lines ) reproduce with no free parameter this behaviour and we obtain a good agreement with the pion spectrum .",
    "proton data show an excess at large @xmath2 that we are not able to reproduce keeping the same values of parameters as before .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite tried to fit their measured proton spectrum with the fritiof code and could not obtain a good description of data .",
    "this indicates that these large @xmath7 points are a problem for standard multiparticle production models as well . in our case , if we change our parameter @xmath16 from the usual value @xmath124 ( solid line ) to @xmath125 ( dashed line ) we can reproduce most of data points both for pions and protons as well .",
    "this is not a big change and indicates that the model would be able to accomodate this new experimental information .",
    "of course , a definite statement about the subject would require a global refitting procedure , which is not our main concern now .",
    "if , at high energies , the reactions @xmath126 and @xmath127 have the same characteristics and if vdm is good hypothesis ( as it seems to be ) , then more about the energy flow in meson - @xmath78 collisions can be learned at hera .",
    "indeed , as mentioned in @xcite , at the hera electron - proton collider the bulk of the cross section corresponds to photoproduction , in which a beam electron is scattered through a very small angle and a quasi - real photon interacts with the proton .",
    "for such small virtualities the dominant interaction mechanism takes place via fluctuation of the photon into a hadronic state which interacts with the proton via the strong force @xcite .",
    "high energy photoproduction exhibits therefore similar characteristics to hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "recent data taken by the zeus collaboration at hera @xcite show that the lp spectra measured in photoproducion and in dis ( where @xmath128 ) are very similar , specially in the large @xmath40 region .",
    "this suggests that , as pointed out in @xcite , the qcd hardness scale for particle production in dis gradually decreases from a ( large ) @xmath129 , which is relevant in the photon fragmentation region , to a soft scale in the proton fragmentation region , which is the one considered here .",
    "we can therefore expect a similarity of the inclusive spectra of the leading protons in high energy hadron - proton collisions , discussed above , and in virtual photon - proton collisions .",
    "in other words , we may say that the photon is neither resolving nor being resolved by the fast emerging protons .",
    "this implies that these reactions are dominated by some non - perturbative mechanism .",
    "this is confirmed by the failure of perturbative qcd @xcite , ( implemented by the monte carlo codes ariadne and herwig ) when applied to the proton frgamentation region . in ref .",
    "@xcite the lp spectra were studied in the context of meson and pomeron exchanges .",
    "here we use the vector meson dominance hypothesis and describe leading proton production in the same way as done for hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "the only change is that now we have @xmath130 instead of @xmath105 collisions .",
    "whereas this may be generally true for photoproduction , it remains an approximation for dis , valid in the large @xmath40 region .    in fig .",
    "1 we show schematically the igm picture of a photon - proton collision . according to it , during the interaction the photon is converted into a hadronic ( mesonic ) state and then interacts with the incoming proton .",
    "this hadronic state is called @xmath29 in the upper legs of figs .",
    "1a ) , 1b ) and 1c ) . at hera",
    "only collisions @xmath131 are relevant .",
    "the meson - proton interaction follows then the usual igm picture , namely : the valence quarks fly through essentially undisturbed whereas the gluonic clouds of both projectiles interact strongly with each other .",
    "the state @xmath29 looses fraction @xmath7 of its original momentum and gets excited carrying a @xmath132 fraction of the initial momentum .",
    "the proton , which we shall call here the diffracted proton , looses only a fraction @xmath21 of its momentum but otherwise remains intact .",
    "we shall assume here , for simplicity , that the vector meson is a @xmath133 and take @xmath134 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega1 ] ) . in fig .",
    "4 we compare our results with zeus data .",
    "the agreement is again good .",
    "we have analyzed leading particle spectra in terms of the igm , which includes now also a contribution coming from the diffractive processes .",
    "the new component improved dramatically the agreement with all existing data on hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "as long as the energy flow is concerned the igm works extremely well with essentially two parameters : the non - perturbative gluon - gluon cross section and the fraction of diffractive events .",
    "this should enlarge considerably its range of applicability in analyses of cosmic ray data .    at the same time , assuming vdm , we were able to describe equally well the leading proton spectra in @xmath135 reactions . also here",
    "the inclusion of a diffractive component provided by the new version of the igm turns out to be crucial to get good agreement with data .",
    "we have shown that the difference between pion and proton leading spectra is due to their different gluon distributions @xcite .",
    "we predict a universality in the diffractive leading particle spectra in the large momentum region , which turns out to be independent of the incident energy and of the projectile type .",
    "we shall collect together here the main points concerning the interacting gluon model ( igm ) scattered throughout the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the igm is based on the idea that since about half of a hadron momentum is carried by gluons and since gluons interact more strongly than quarks , during a collision there is a separation of constituents .",
    "valence quarks tend to be fast forming leading particles whereas gluons tend to be stopped in the central rapidity region .",
    "it belongs therefore to the class of models exploring the concept of partons and of hard and semihard collisions ( like those presented by gaisser and stanev @xcite , sjostrand @xcite , wang @xcite or geiger @xcite ) .",
    "the latter are collisions between partons at a moderate scale ( @xmath136 ) , which , however , still allows for the use of perturbative qcd .",
    "the scattered partons form the so - called minijets . at @xmath137",
    "the minijet cross section is already @xmath138 of the total inelastic cross section .",
    "however , apart from some ambiguity in choosing the semihard scale , these models have to face the problem that even at very high energies a significant part of a hadronic collision occurs at scales lower than the semihard one .",
    "the atitude taken in hijing @xcite , in the parton cascade model @xcite and also in the igm is to extrapolate these quantities to lower scales .",
    "these extrapolations can be continuously improved , especially in view of the advance of our knowledge on non - perturbative effects .",
    "there are , for example , models for distribution functions which work at scales as low as @xmath139 @xcite . as for",
    "@xmath12 one can compute non - perturbative effects in the context of an operator product expansion .",
    "inspite of these limitations these models have the advantage of dealing with partons and being thus prepared to incorporate perturbative qcd in a natural way .",
    "this is welcome since perturbative processes are expected to be increasingly important at higher energies .",
    "compared to the other models mentioned above , the igm is simpler because it is designed to study energy flow and makes no attempt to calculate cross sections or to follow hadronization in great detail .",
    "this simplifies the calculations and avoids time consuming numerical simulations .",
    "the most important aspect of the igm , shared with those models , is the assumption of multiple parton - parton incoherent scattering which is implicit in the poissonian distribution of the number of parton - parton collisions ( which is also used in refs .",
    "@xcite ) used below .",
    "* the two colliding hadrons are represented by valence quarks carrying their quantum numbers ( charges ) plus the accompanying clouds of gluons ( which represent also the sea @xmath8 pairs and therefore should be regarded as effective ones ) . *",
    "in the course of a collision the gluonic clouds interact strongly depositing in the central region of the reaction fractions @xmath7 and @xmath21 of the initial energy - momenta of the respective projectiles in the form of a gluonic _ central fireball _",
    "( cf ) . * the valence quarks ( plus those gluons which did not interact )",
    "get excited and form _ leading jets _",
    "( lj s ) which then populate mainly the fragmentation regions of the reaction .",
    "the fraction of energy stored in the cf is therefore equal to @xmath140 and its rapidity is @xmath141 .",
    "these two quantities provide then a sort of dynamically calculated initial conditions for any statistical model of multiparticle production and that was one of the initial aims of the igm .    according to the igm the cf consists of _ minifireballs _ ( mf ) formed from pairs of colliding gluons . in collisions at higher scales",
    "a mf is the same as a pair of minijets or jets . in the study of energy",
    "flow the details of fragmentation and hadron production are not important .",
    "most of the mf s will be in the central region and we assume that they coalesce forming the cf . the collisions leading to mf s occur at different energy scales given by @xmath142 , where the index @xmath143 labels a particular kinematic configuration where the gluon from the projectile has momentum @xmath144 and the gluon from the target has @xmath145 .",
    "we have to choose the scale where we start to use perturbative qcd .",
    "many studies in the literature converge to the value @xmath146 . below this value",
    "we have to assume that we can still talk about individual soft gluons and due to the short correlation length ( found in lattice qcd calculations ) between them they still interact mostly pairwise . in this region",
    "we can no longer use the distribution functions extracted from dis nor the perturbative elementary cross sections .",
    "the central quantity in the igm is the probability to form a cf carrying momentum fractions @xmath7 and @xmath21 of two colliding hadrons .",
    "it is defined as the sum over an undefined number @xmath147 of mf s : @xmath148 \\delta \\left [     y - n_1 \\ , y_1 - \\cdots - n_i \\",
