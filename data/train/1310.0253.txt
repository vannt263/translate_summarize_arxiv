    ", one usually considers the lscher ",
    "weisz string @xcite , i.e. , a string with fixed endpoints , corresponding to a string stretched between two stationary d0 branes .",
    "however , at least for light quarks , this does not seem to be a good approximation , as for reasonable values of the quark mass , the string tension , and the distance , one expects the quarks to rotate relativistically around each other .",
    "it is thus desirable to work with more realistic configurations .    here , we study the nambu  goto string with masses at the ends , and compute the spectrum of excitations of the rigid solution , at first order in perturbation theory ( corresponding to @xmath4 ) .",
    "we find that , when moving away from the static limit , the degeneracy of the frequency of planar and scalar excitations ( polarized in the plane of rotation or orthogonal to it ) is lifted .",
    "the degeneracy is restored in the relativistic limit , in which the ends of the string move at the speed of light .",
    "furthermore , we identify interesting quasi - massless modes in the limit of slow rotation , which are not present in the lscher  weisz string .",
    "the first treatment of the nambu  goto string with masses at the ends seems to have been the work of chodos and thorn @xcite .",
    "they discussed the rigid rotating string solution , but did not study its excitations .",
    "such a study was performed by hadasz @xcite , but for the case in which also a gau  bonnet term is present .",
    "this leads to too many boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , the limit in which the coefficient of the gau  bonnet term vanishes does not reduce to our case .",
    "a non - relativistic approximation to the rotating string was studied by nesterenko @xcite .",
    "we reproduce some of his results in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "however , our results differ in several aspects , in particular planar and scalar polarizations are not distinguished in @xcite .",
    "the most recent study of the excitation spectrum of the rotating string with masses at the ends seems to have been the work of baker and steinke @xcite .",
    "they use path integral techniques and obtain results for the spectrum of the excitations , which they study further in the limits of massless endpoints and one massless and one infinitely heavy endpoint .",
    "they use these to obtain regge trajectories for the excited states . the main differences to our work",
    "are the following : we use perturbations that are normal to the background string , which simplifies the calculation considerably .",
    "we discuss the evolution of the spectrum over the whole range of parameters .",
    "in particular , we find interesting quasi - massless modes in the limit of a slowly rotating string .",
    "finally , we have a different point of view regarding the significance of the spectrum , i.e. , world - sheet energies , for the calculation of target space energies .",
    "the article is structured as follows : in the next section , we introduce the setup and recall some basic results about the rotating rigid string . in section  [ sec : perturbations ] , we consider perturbations of the rigid string and in particular compute their spectrum . for the limiting cases of a static and a massless string ,",
    "this can be done analytically , while in the intermediate regime we use numerical methods . in section",
    "[ sec : energy ] we argue that the relation of target space and world - sheet energies is more complicated than assumed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "in particular , at the order usually considered , one already has to take the interaction into account .",
    "we conclude with a summary and an outlook .",
    "the nambu  goto action with boundary terms accounting for masses is given by @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the source space and @xmath7 the determinant of the induced metric , pulled back by the embedding @xmath8 : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the minkowski metric on @xmath11 , with signature @xmath12 .",
    "likewise , @xmath13 is the induced metric pulled back to @xmath14 .    on @xmath6",
    ", we choose coordinates @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "we determine the boundary conditions corresponding to the action , by the requirement that the boundary terms vanish .",
    "this leads to @xmath16    let us now consider the rigid rotating string solution , which we parameterize as @xmath17 where @xmath18 stands for the @xmath18 of @xmath19 . here , we have to choose @xmath20 .",
    "one easily computes @xmath21 so that the boundary conditions are satisfied , provided that @xmath22 two limits are of particular interest : the _ relativistic limit _",
    "@xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 , in which the velocity of the ends of the strings approaches unity . and the _ static limit _",
    "@xmath25 , while keeping @xmath26 fixed , which corresponds to the string connecting two stationary d0 branes , separated by the distance @xmath1 .",
    "the energy of a string configuration is given by @xcite @xmath27 for the rotating string solution , we compute , using , the energy @xmath28 where the first term is due to the string and the second one due to the masses at the ends . by comparison with the expression for the static string , we conclude that the _ effective length _ of the string is given by @xmath29 note that this is greater than the length of the string measured in the laboratory frame , which is given by @xmath30 .",
    "we note that the solution breaks a couple of symmetries of the target minkowski space .",
    "all spatial translations are broken , whereas time translation survives if accompanied by a rotation in the @xmath31 plane .",
    "furthermore , all boosts are broken , as well as the rotations in the planes @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , for @xmath34 .",
    "below , we identify @xmath35 corresponding zero modes , consistently with the fact that locally we break @xmath35 translational symmetries @xcite . in the static limit , we will find quasi - massless modes for the remaining broken symmetries , with the exception of the boosts .",
    "now we consider perturbations of the rotating string solution , henceforth denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "that is , we write @xmath37 and expand the action in @xmath38 .",
    "as we are perturbing around a classical solution , the component of first order in @xmath38 vanishes .",
    "the action at second order in @xmath38 defines the free part @xmath39 of the action . due to the diffeomorphism invariance of the action , the equations of motion derived from @xmath39 are not hyperbolic .",
    "the physical degrees of freedom of the bulk part of the action are the normal perturbations @xcite , i.e. , those fulfilling @xmath40 the gauge condition we will adopt here is to set the longitudinal perturbations to @xmath18 .",
    "this was apparently first proposed in @xcite .",
    "obviously , this gauge choice preserves the target space symmetries that are unbroken by the solution .    in the following ,",
    "we distinguish between the @xmath41 _ scalar _ polarizations , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , which are orthogonal to the plane of rotation , and one _ planar _ polarization , which may be written as @xmath44 due to the boundary condition , we have a supplementary physical degree of freedom at the boundary , namely radial perturbations",
    ". we may write them as @xmath45 where @xmath46 lives on the boundary , i.e. , at @xmath47 .",

    "the even / odd solutions are given by @xmath53 the planar mode equation can be solved by choosing the coordinate @xmath54 and the ansatz @xmath55 , leading to @xmath56 which is the defining equation for legendre functions @xcite .",

    "similarly , @xmath62 as defined in degenerates for @xmath63",
    ". the symmetric solution for @xmath63 may instead be written as @xmath64 . ]",
    "@xmath65 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      it remains to impose the correct boundary conditions . by restricting to even or odd solutions",
    ", it suffices to solve one of the boundary conditions . for the scalar polarization , we obtain , by expanding to first order in @xmath38 and employing the relation , @xmath66 these are frequency dependent boundary conditions , similar to those derived for the nonrelativistic approximation in @xcite . for further occurrences of such boundary conditions ,",
    "we refer to the references cited there .    for the even / odd modes in",
    ", the boundary condition reduces to the transcendental equationsin @xcite , these two equations correspond to the roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath67 , cf .",

    "@xmath68 it follows straightforwardly that one always has the two solutions @xmath69 furthermore , it is clear that no solutions with imaginary frequency exist , as @xmath70 and @xmath71 are both positive for positive argument .",
    "we note that for polarization in direction @xmath72 , the @xmath73 mode ( with real coefficient ) corresponds to translations in direction @xmath72 .",
    "contrary to the @xmath73 mode , the @xmath74 mode is complex , due to the phase @xmath75 .",
    "hence , after multiplication with a complex coefficient @xmath76 , one has to take the real part .",
    "comparison with the background solution shows that for polarization in the direction @xmath72 , this corresponds to an infinitesimal rotation in the plane spanned by @xmath77 and @xmath72 .",
    "below , we will see that this mode is quasi - massless in the static limit .    for the planar polarization",
    ", we have to take the radial mode into account . upon contracting the first order expansion of with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , cf .   and , we obtain @xmath80",
    "hence , the boundary condition for the planar polarization is @xmath81 in particular , for @xmath82 , we obtain @xmath83 it is then straightforward to check that @xmath84 always solve the boundary condition . comparison of and shows that for small @xmath85 , the @xmath73 mode corresponds to rotations in the @xmath31 plane , so we identify it with the goldstone mode for this broken symmetry . as for the scalar @xmath74 mode , we multiply the planar @xmath74 mode with a complex coefficient @xmath86 and take the real part . for small @xmath85",
    ", this corresponds to a translation in the direction @xmath87 .",
    "again , this mode is quasi - massless in the static limit .",
    "hence , we have identified the ( quasi- ) goldstone modes for spatial translations and rotations in the planes @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "to summarize , both for the scalar and the planar polarization , we have the two modes @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "note , however , that the scalar @xmath90 mode is even / odd , while for the planar polarization this is converse .",
    "let us analyze the solutions to the boundary conditions in the limiting cases @xmath91 and @xmath24 .",
    "in the first case , the scalar polarization boundary condition reduces , for @xmath92 , to dirichlet boundary conditions , so that we find @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "as we already have @xmath73 and @xmath74 modes , we define @xmath95 , @xmath96 , where even / odd @xmath97 corresponds to an even / odd mode . naively converting this to target space energies ( but see section  [ sec : energy ] ) , this corresponds to energies @xmath98 note that the energy of the @xmath74 mode vanishes in the limit @xmath91 , if expressed in natural units , as @xmath99 for the planar polarization and @xmath92 , the boundary conditions also reduce to dirichlet boundary conditions in the limit @xmath91 . using the expansions (",
    "* eqns 8.10.7 & 8.10.8 ) , one sees that in the limit of large @xmath100 , we have @xmath101 hence , we again find the solutions @xmath93 , @xmath94 in the limit @xmath91 , where even / odd @xmath97 corresponds to an odd / even solution .",
    "we already identified the odd @xmath73 mode and the even @xmath74 mode .",
    "the first of the above modes is an even mode , so we are missing one odd mode .",
    "it turns out that it is given by @xmath102 in the limit @xmath91 , for which the expression in brackets in vanishes .",
    "hence , the remaining modes can be identified as @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "note that , as for the @xmath74 mode in the scalar case , the energy of the planar modes @xmath74 and @xmath105 vanish in natural units in the limit @xmath91 .",
    "hence , apart from the supplementary quasi - massless modes , we find a degeneracy of the scalar and planar modes in the static limit .",
    "this is of course to be expected , as in this limit one can not distinguish scalar and planar polarization .",
    "let us now look at the limit @xmath24 . in the scalar case",
    ", the boundary condition tends to neumann boundary conditions , so we expect the solutions @xmath106 , @xmath107 , where even @xmath97 corresponds to an even mode and vice versa .    at first sight , the planar boundary condition seems to tend to dirichlet boundary conditions in the limit @xmath24 , due to the @xmath108 dependence of the second term .",
    "however , the solutions @xmath109 generically behave as @xmath110 around @xmath111 , in which case both terms in behave as @xmath112 .",
    "hence , the situation is more complicated . by numerical analysis",
    ", one finds that in the limit @xmath24 , the @xmath109 solve the boundary conditions for odd / even @xmath100 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath113 .",
    "hence , in the relativistic limit , the scalar and planar modes also degenerate , but now even scalar modes degenerate with odd planar modes and vice versa . hence , we expect that for @xmath114 , the degeneracy is lifted .",

    ".the parity and the frequency of the scalar and planar modes in the static ( @xmath91 ) and relativistic ( @xmath24 ) limit . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for @xmath114 , the frequencies of the modes can be found numerically .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] shows these as a function of @xmath85 .",
    "as expected , the degeneracy of the scalar and planar modes is lifted . in the limit of a slowly rotating string",
    ", there are three quasi massless modes , the two @xmath115 modes and the planar @xmath116 mode .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , these have not been discussed before .",
    "the first two have a geometric interpretation , namely rotations in the scalar and translations in the planar case .",
    "the significance of the planar @xmath116 mode is presently unclear , but it could be relevant for stability , cf .",
    "the discussion of the `` roughening transition '' in @xcite , for example .    .",
    "note that both the scalar and the planar @xmath117 mode have vanishing frequency . ]",
    "in order to interpret our results , let us first note that the free hamiltonian corresponding to @xmath39 is given by @xmath118 where in the first line the @xmath119 s are evaluated at @xmath120 , and in the second line @xmath121 . denoting by @xmath122 the @xmath97th scalar / planar mode frequency",

    "to the time @xmath140 on the world - sheet , of the first excited state of the scalar / planar @xmath97th mode is @xmath141 .",
    "there now seem to be two possibilities to define the target space energy .",
    "the first one is to take and expand it in @xmath38 .",
    "the second one is to relate the target space energy to the world - sheet energy .",
    "a translation in @xmath140 corresponds in target space to a translation in time and a rotation in the 1 - 2 plane . by the choice of the classical solution ,",
    "the target space time translation invariance is broken to discrete time translations @xmath142 , corresponding to translations @xmath143 on the world - sheet .",
    "the broken time translation invariance corresponds to considering energies modulo @xmath144 .",
    "this reasoning suggests that , up to this ambiguity , the target space energy is given by the world - sheet energy divided by @xmath145 .",
    "this would mean that , in the massless limit @xmath24 , all target space energies are equivalent to @xmath18 modulo @xmath144 .",
    "however , there already is a definition of the target space energy which we used to compute the energy of the classical solution , namely .",

    "two facts are noteworthy : first , the world - sheet hamiltonian does not have a linear term , so there does not seem to be any relation to the world - sheet energy .",
    "second , as the target space energy does have a contribution at first order in @xmath38 , the computation of higher order contributions does have to take the interaction into account . to see what happens if the interaction is neglected , consider the contribution to the target space energy from the scalar polarizations .",
    "one obtains , at second order in @xmath38 , @xmath147.\\ ] ] this corresponds to the scalar contribution to the hamiltonian , except for the factor @xmath144 and the weight @xmath148 . due to this weight , upon replacing @xmath149 by the expansion",
    ", we can no longer use the orthogonality relations to conclude that only the combinations @xmath150 and @xmath151 occur .",
    "put differently , this quantity is not conserved .",
    "of course the full target space energy is conserved , so in a perturbative expansion , one has conservation at each order .",
    "the correct scalar contribution to @xmath152 at second order has to take into account the contribution of the interaction terms @xmath153 to @xmath154 .",
    "note that @xmath154 itself is conserved , but only under the free time - evolution .    to conclude ,",
    "let us discuss the static limit .",
    "then the rotation is negligible and one would expect that one can indeed identify world - sheet and target space energies by scaling with @xmath145 .",
    "let us see how this arises in our expression for the target space energy . in the limit @xmath91 , @xmath155 diverges , so the first order contribution tends to @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , the weight @xmath148 in tends to @xmath156 , so one obtains the scalar contribution to the world - sheet hamiltonian , up to the factor @xmath144 .",
    "we computed the spectrum of excitations of the rotating nambu ",
    "goto string , with masses at the ends .",
    "we distinguished between scalar and planar polarizations and showed that the degeneracy of these in the static limit ( corresponding to the lscher ",
    "weisz string ) is lifted for finite rotation speed . in the massless limit , the degeneracy is again restored .",
    "we identified interesting quasi - massless modes in the limit of the slowly rotating string .",
    "we discussed two possible definitions of the target space energy , a naive one which relates world - sheet to target space energies , and one that is based on the perturbative expansion of the standard expression for the target space energy .",
    "we also showed that the two notions coincide in the static limit .",
    "an interesting further goal would be to obtain quantum corrections to the classical regge trajectories .",
