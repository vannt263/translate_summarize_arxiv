    "they argued that the compact object in the system is a black hole based on the mass of the compact object derived from orbital parameters and the optical companion mass , the lack of pulsations , and analysis of the extracted x - ray spectrum .",
    "those authors concluded that 7  would be the first eclipsing black hole hmxb .    the black hole nature of 7  was firmly established by @xcite using observations of the  advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) survey of 33  ( 33 ,",

    "[ sec : tim ] and [ sec : eph ] ) .",
    "the average brightness of 47  varied strongly between the 33   observations . however , the determination of accurate count rates and light curves turned out to be quite difficult because in all observations the source is positioned far off axis and therefore has a large extent due to broadening of the telescope point spread function ( psf ) which may stretch over bad ccd columns ( e.g. in obsid 6377 ) or may partly fall outside the detector field of view ( fov ) ( 6382 , 6385 , 6387 , 7226 , 7344 ) .",
    "an extreme case is presented in obsid 6383 where the position of the source falls outside the detector and only a small part of the psf is recorded . in several of the observations , counts from 47",
    "are rejected in standard level 2 event files when the source is moving across rejected columns due to satellite dithering .",
    "this effect can reduce the counts in 1000 s integration intervals by varying amounts and create spurious periods in timing analysis .",
    "therefore , we created new level 2 event files for broadband time variability analysis that did not reject these columns . for better comparison we applied an approximate flux correction to account for the size of the extraction region relative to the psf size and to convert to an equivalent on - axis source . for each observation ,",
    "a chart raytrace @xcite was performed for a 1.5 kev on - axis point source for an input ray density of 1 mm@xmath11 , and the total number of resulting rays was evaluated . for each observation ,",
    "another chart run was performed for a 1.5 kev point source ( ray density also 1 mm@xmath11 ) at the appropriate off - axis position ; this applies the mirror reflectivity and vignetting .",
    "the rays were projected to the detector using the ciao tool psf_project_ray , which also applied an approximate detector quantum efficiency ( qe ) . in many cases , the source is near the edge of the detector , or in one case , off the detector ( although some of the large psf at that position is still on the detector ) . to account for these exposure variations resulting from chip edges and spacecraft dither , we weighted `` counts '' images generated from the raytrace pseudo - event lists by a fractional exposure map .",
    "the fractional exposure map accounts for the fraction of the time a sky pixel is on the detector , and is obtained by constructing an `` exposure map '' in which the  high resolution mirror assembly ( hrma ) effective area and detector qe are both set to unity .",
    "we extracted weighted counts from a region corresponding to the extraction region in the real observation to get the predicted number of counts within the extraction region used for the real data .",
    "this provides the predicted number of counts for the given source intensity .",
    "the normalization to an on - axis source is obtained by dividing the on - axis predicted counts by the extracted off - axis predicted counts .",
    "this factor was used to scale the observed fluxes to the values they would have had on - axis . for spectral fitting , 47  photons were extracted from ciao v4.0 level 2 event files using the same area as for the time variability analysis , but with the bad columns excluded .",

    "in determining the parameters of the 47  system , we first search for a stellar model ( identified by the effective temperature @xmath58 , the logarithm of the surface gravity @xmath59 , and the chemical composition fe / h in solar units ) that fits the broad - band photometry of the system , assuming the optical brightness is coming from the optical star alone . from the stellar radius , the observed x - ray eclipse width and the periodic elliptical modulation in the optical , we can derive the two masses as a function of the orbital inclination .",
    "this analysis is similar to the one presented by for 7 .      to estimate the radius of the optical companion we compared the ubvri photometry for the star from @xcite to the [ fe / h ] = 0 table of model stellar atmosphere broad - band colors computed by . assuming a photometric uncertainty of 0.05 mag , color excess ratios of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and a minimum extinction of @xmath63 which is the foreground reddening to 33  from @xcite , we place a 95% lower limit on the effective temperature of 19000 k and a lower limit on @xmath64 of 2.5 .",
    "the formal best fit model has @xmath65 k , @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "note that the extinction is in good agreement with the range of values predicted from analyzing the x - ray spectrum ( @xmath69 ) . assuming a distance of 795 kpc to 33  and the  standard value \" for the ratio of total to selective extinction @xmath70 @xcite , we place a 95% upper limit of 10.8 on the radius . for the best fit model",
    "the radius is 8.0 . for the assumed distance and best - fit extinction the absolute magnitude of the star is @xmath71 which , assuming the star is a main - sequence dwarf , would correspond to a star of type b0v @xcite .",
    "we note that the effective temperature for such a star , @xmath72 k , is close to the formal best - fit temperature from modelling the broad - band colors .",
    "we used the `` physics of eclipsing binaries ( phoebe ) '' program of @xcite , a front - end code for the wilson - devinney program @xcite , to model the obtained periodic light curves and to derive an estimate of the masses of both components .",
    "the main effect is due to the tidally induced ellipsoidal shape of the optical component .",
    "we ran phoebe on the cfht @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 light curves , assuming the x - ray determined eclipse half angle value of @xmath73 and using linear limb darkening coefficients from , stepping through inclination and fitting for the mass ratio .",
    "figure  [ fig : opt_lc ] shows a representative phoebe model fit to the light curves for a binary system with an inclination of @xmath74 .",
    "we note that due to the degeneracy between @xmath75 , @xmath76 and the roche - lobe - filling factor , the model fit is similar for other allowed inclinations .",
    "figure  [ fig : mvi ] shows a plot of the optical star and compact - object masses as a function of @xmath76 for each of these different @xmath58 values . below @xmath77",
    "the optical star fills its roche lobe . from the plot for the compact object mass , a neutron star with canonical mass of 1.4",
    "seems to be allowed for inclinations below 85  for the 50000 k model , but only for below 75  for the 33000 k model . for the 19000 k model , a canonical mass neutron star seems to be excluded .",
    "a neutron star with canonical mass at the best fit companion temperature @xmath58 of 33000 k would imply a system inclination @xmath78 and a companion mass of 10.9 .",
    "the time variability of 47   in the 33  observations can be explained with a 1.7 d eclipsing x - ray binary with an eclipse half angle of @xmath79 .",
    "the identification with an ob star in 33  that shows an ellipsoidal light curve , clearly establishes the system as the second hmxb in 33 .",
    "we do not detect pulsations in the x - ray flux and therefore the compact object in the system could be a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum , however , may indicate a neutron star system ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we can not exclude that the long term variability of the system in the ,  and observations can be of irregular nature .",
    "however , it also could reflect a long term periodicity similar to those known in her x1 , lmc x4 or smc x1 .",
    "the   bright state observations ( obsid 6387 and 6385 ) are separated by 84 days . with our sparse unsystematic monitoring , we can not decide if the source had another on - state in between as would be expected by extrapolating from the 35 d period of her x1 , a system with a similar orbital period .",
    "inspecting the available @xcite colour and emission - line images we find that the object is located in a region with few ( bright ) stars .",
    "also , there are no close - by emission nebulae , indicating that the object is older than 7  which is still located in a  region .    47  was serendipitously detected far off axis in the 33  observations . only with the help of dedicated deep observations with good time resolution it will be possible to characterize long term variability of 47  and to search for the expected pulsation period below 50 seconds .",
