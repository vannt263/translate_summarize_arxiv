    "the modification becomes more prominent with the increase of the mode number .",
    "next , include the transverse electric field .",
    "to this end , the dispersion equation ( [ sc_ka disp eq perp longitudinally - transverse waves ] ) is solved , where @xmath163 , @xmath165 and @xmath164 are considered in accordance with equations ( [ sc_ka e xx perp 1])-([sc_ka e yy perp 1 ] ) dropping terms proportional to the magnetic moment @xmath7 .",
    "corresponding results are presented in fig .",
    "it shows that the spectrum of bernstein modes is not changed , but additional lines appear",
    ". finally , the terms caused by the spin dynamics are to include . in this regime , the full elements of the dielectric permeability tensor presented by equations ( [ sc_ka e xx perp 1])-([sc_ka e yy perp 1 ] ) are employed .",
    "comparison of coefficients in classic and spin terms shows a relative increase of the spin terms at the large wave vector .",
    "modification of the extraordinary wave spectrum due to the separate spin evolution is found and presented in fig .",
    "it is rather small , but noticeable contribution .",
    "the spin dynamics in considered regime gives even smaller contribution which is not presented in figures .",
    "this subsection shows that the major contribution in the bernstein modes and extraordinary wave spectra in the considered parameter regime gives the separate spin evolution of electrons .",
    "two groups of results have been found .",
    "one is related to the transverse linearly polarized ( ordinary ) waves propagating perpendicular to the external magnetic field with the electric field perturbation parallel to the external magnetic field .",
    "the second group of results is related to the longitudinally - transverse elliptically polarized ( extraordinary ) waves propagating perpendicular to the external magnetic field with the electric field perturbation perpendicular to the external magnetic field .",
    "the following results are found in the first regime .",
    "the spectrum modification of the cyclotron waves and the triplet fine structure for each cyclotron wave existing due to combination of spin effects have been demonstrated .",
    "properties of the lowest spin - cyclotron wave with the frequency near @xmath120 have been studied for the partially spin polarized degenerate electron gas .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment leads to the fine structure formation and appearance of the lowest cyclotron wave .",
    "however , several effects contribute into the form of dispersion curves .",
    "they are the classic terms modified by the separate spin evolution and terms caused by the spin dynamics ( they also contain the separate spin evolution ) .",
    "the spin terms are specific in two ways .",
    "they give a noticeable contribution even if the anomalous magnetic moment is neglected , but the anomalous magnetic moment causes additional effects like the fine structure . relative contributions of these effects are traced analytically and numerically .",
    "the bernstein modes are considered in the second regime .",
    "it has been found that the separate spin evolution modifies the oscillatory structure of the bernstein modes .",
    "the modification increases with the increase of the mode number .",
    "this effects remains at the account of the transverse field .",
    "similar modification is found for the extraordinary wave .",
    "first of all the obtained results are important for the magnetically ordered conductors and semiconductors .",
    "they can be applied to the degenerate astrophysical plasmas with the large spin polarization of charge carriers either .",
