    "an accurate description of matter distribution in nuclei is a longstanding problem in modern nuclear physics that has a wide impact on our understanding of nuclear structure .",
    "whereas the charge distribution has been measured with high accuracy using electron - nucleus elastic scattering , so that the charge radii are usually known with uncertainties lower than @xmath1 @xcite , our knowledge of neutron distribution is considerably less precise .",
    "several experiments of neutron radius have been carried out in recent years @xcite , but the use of hadronic probes produces uncertainties in the experimental results due to the assumptions of the models required to deal with the complexity of the strong interaction .",
    "an accurate and model independent probe of neutron distributions is provided by parity - violating electron scattering ( pves ) : the parity - violating asymmetry @xmath2 , i.e. , the difference between the cross sections for the scattering of electrons longitudinally polarized parallel and antiparallel to their momentum , represents an almost direct measurement of the fourier transform of the neutron density @xcite that is free from most strong interaction uncertainties .",
    "the prex collaboration @xcite at jlab used parity - violating electron scattering ( pves ) to study the neutron distribution of @xmath0pb and provided us with the first determination of the neutron radius through an electroweak probe that gives @xmath3 fm for the neutron skin thickness .",
    "although the total error is large , the prex method is very interesting and future higher statistics data are expected to reduce the uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the crex collaboration at jlab has made a successful proposal to measure the neutron radius of @xmath4ca using pves with a goal of @xmath5 fm in accuracy @xcite .",
    "recently , in a measurement of the coherent @xmath6 photoproduction from @xmath0pb at mainz @xcite , the shape of the neutron distribution has been found to be @xmath7 more diffuse than the charge distribution and the neutron skin thickness is @xmath8 ( stat ) @xmath9 ( syst ) fm .",
    "this value is compatible with previous independent measurements , i.e. , proton elastic scattering @xcite , x - ray cascade of antiprotonic atoms @xcite , anti - analog giant dipole resonances @xcite , giant quadrupole resonances @xcite , pigmy dipole resonance @xcite , electric dipole polarizability @xcite or pionic probes @xcite .",
    "the neutron skin of @xmath0pb has important implications for astrophysics @xcite , owing to its strong correlation with the pressure of neutron matter at densities near @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "the larger the pressure of neutron matter , the thicker is the skin as neutrons are pushed out against surface tension .",
    "the same pressure supports neutron stars against gravity , therefore correlations between neutron skins of neutron - rich nuclei and various neutron star properties are naturally expected @xcite .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of @xmath12 in heavy nuclei provides very interesting information on the nature of 3-body forces in nuclei , nuclear drip lines and collective nuclear excitations , as well as heavy - ion collisions .",
    "a recent review of experimental measurements of @xmath12 and their theoretical implications can be found in @xcite .    in this work we present and discuss numerical predictions for the neutron density distribution of @xmath0pb . in @xcite",
    "we have already considered the evolution of the charge density distribution and of the proton wave functions along different isotopic chains . in @xcite",
    "we have extended our study to isotonic chains . in @xcite",
    "we have already compared our calculations for the asymmetry parameter @xmath2 using the relativistic ddme2 interaction with the results of the first run of prex on @xmath0pb and we have provided numerical predictions for the future experiment crex on @xmath4ca .",
    "in addition , we have studied the behavior of @xmath2 along oxygen and calcium isotopic chains @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the work undertaken in @xcite comparing results obtained with different non - relativistic and relativistic model interactions .",
    "our results are compared with the recent @xmath13 data from mainz and with the data of the prex experiment .",
    "in addition , we consider also the correlations between the neutron skin and the slope and curvature coefficients of the nuclear symmetry energy .",

    "the experimental data of @xcite are @xmath16 fm and @xmath17 ( stat ) @xmath18 ( syst ) fm . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the best description of heavy nuclei , at the moment , relies on energy density functionals in terms of effective interactions calibrated on the bulk properties of a limited set of nuclei .",
    "the isoscalar part of the interaction is usually constrained by reproducing binding energies and charge radii ( @xmath0pb is usually included in fit protocol ) where the isospin - dependent part of the interaction is mainly constrained reproducing some _",
    "ab - initio _ equation of state ( eos ) for neutron matter , like the akmal - friedmann - pandharipande eos @xcite , or the empirical value of the asymmetry energy at the saturation point .",
    "so far , theoretical calculations based on realistic potentials are limited to medium - light nuclei , even if new approaches based on renormalization group potentials look very promising @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider different non - relativistic and relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models and compare their predictions for the neutron distribution of @xmath0pb .",
    "the details of the mean - field approaches we have adopted in our investigation are presented in various publications , for instance in @xcite .",
    "we do not repeat here the derivation of the various expressions used in our calculations but we refer the readers to the original papers .",
    "our strategy is to explore all variants of density functional approaches in terms of covariant ( walecka type ) _ vs. _ non - covariant ( skyrme and gogny ) descriptions ,",
    "finite range _ vs. _ contact interactions and non - linear _ vs. _ density dependent couplings .",
    "we have checked that the different forces adopted for our calculations give some differences in the neutron single - particle levels around the fermi surface in @xmath0pb , but do not produce significant inversions in the energy levels .",
    "the levels above the @xmath19 shell closure are unoccupied .",
    "generally , the nucleon distributions are parameterized as a single symmetrised two - parameter fermi distribution ( 2pf ) @xcite with half - height radius @xmath14 and diffuseness @xmath15 .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath20 cross sections data from mainz gives @xmath16 fm and @xmath17 ( stat ) @xmath18 ( syst ) fm @xcite and suggests that the neutron distribution of @xmath0pb is @xmath21 more diffuse than the charge distribution and that the neutron skin of lead is of partial halo type .    in table",

    "[ fig : r_a ] these results are directly compared with the experimental data for @xmath14 and @xmath15 . neither the nonrelativistic gogny and skyrme nor the rmf models are able to simultaneously reproduce the experimental data for both @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the finite - range gogny d1s interaction reproduces @xmath14 but slightly overestimates @xmath15 .",
    "the skyrme interaction parametrizations ( those starting with s ) generally give similar results for @xmath14 and @xmath15 that reproduce the experimental value of @xmath14 within two standard deviations and overestimate @xmath15 , but the siii interactions that reproduce the experimental value of @xmath15 and overestimate @xmath14 .",
    "the rmf models that include nonlinear self - interaction meson couplings ( those starting with nl ) reproduce the diffuseness but overestimate the radius over three standard deviations .",
    "these results are consistent with the observation that the mixed isoscalar - isovector coupling terms in the lagrangian densities should be taken into account to significantly change the neutron radii @xcite .",
    "the rmf models with point - coupling interaction ( those with pc ) , i.e. , where the zero - range point - coupling interaction is used instead of the meson exchange , give almost coincident results that overestimate @xmath14 and reproduce @xmath15 .",
    "the relativistic functionals with density - dependent vertex functions ( those starting with dd ) agree with the experimental diffuseness and reproduce the radius within two standard deviations .",
    "the density - dependent pkdd model overestimates @xmath14 and reproduce @xmath15 .    to obtain a simple model of the neutron density distributions ,",
    "we have evaluated the weighted average parameters of the 2pf profiles extracted from the results of the different models and have obtained @xmath22 fm and @xmath23 fm : the surface diffuseness is in fair agreement with the mainz data but the radius is a bit larger .",
    "this weighted  result is plotted with the green square ( mean ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_a ] . to be more confident , we have checked that the 2pf profile of the charge distribution obtained with this weighted average procedure is able to satisfactorily reproduce the experimental data of elastic electron scattering cross sections off @xmath0pb .",

    "owing to the fact that the @xmath25 boson couples mainly with the neutron , @xmath26 depends essentially on the neutron distribution . our predictions for different interactions are in rather good agreement with the empirical data .",
    "in addition , the weak distribution evaluated using the 2pf functions for the proton and neutron density distributions with weighted average parameters is also in good agreement with the data .",
    "the prex collaboration measured the parity - violating asymmetry parameter @xmath2 averaged over the experimental acceptance function @xmath27 @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the asymmetry and the differential cross section at the scattering angle @xmath31 .",
    "the charge radius of @xmath0pb is very well known @xcite ; therefore , the empirical estimate @xmath32(stat ) @xmath33(syst ) ppm can be related to the neutron radius and the neutron rms radius results @xmath34 fm that implies that the neutron skin thickness is @xmath3 fm .",

    "our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : apv_rneu ] are in accordance with this observation .",
    "owing to the large experimental uncertainties , our theoretical predictions are in agreement with the data but they all predict a smaller radius than the central value of @xmath35 fm . to obtain a significantly larger @xmath36 and a smaller @xmath2",
    "the lagrangian density should contain also the mixed isoscalar - isovector coupling term as described in @xcite .",
    "we observe , however , that a large neutron radius is not in agreement with other experimental measurements @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : apv_skin ] we present the results for the parity - violating asymmetry versus the neutron skin predicted by the different models . owing to the fact that the neutron skin is highly correlated with the neutron radius , these results are similar to those in fig .",

    "although all the predictions in fig .",
    "[ fig : apv_rneu ] and [ fig : apv_skin ] are compatible with the prex results , the large error bars prevent us from discriminating among some of them .",
    "other @xmath12 measurements are more precise and seem to rule out models with either very small or very large neutron skins .",

    "we have presented and discussed numerical predictions for the neutron density distribution of @xmath0pb .",
    "the determination of the neutron distribution in nuclei has proven to be a serious challange to our understanding of nuclear structure and it is one of the major topics of interest in nuclear physics .",
    "great experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted over the last years to achieve this goal . in the next years",
