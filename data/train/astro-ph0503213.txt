    "despite initial reactions to the first year _ _ wmap _ _ data  `` the most revolutionary result is that there are no revolutionary results '' @xcite  continued assessment has revealed some interesting discrepancies with the inferred best - fit , cosmological constant dominated , inflationary model of the primordial fluctuation spectrum .    a debate about the apparently low quadrupole amplitude ( originally observed by _",
    "cobe_-dmr ) has arisen @xcite along with claims about other anomalies on large angular scales .",
    "@xcite demonstrated a curious planarity and alignment of the quadrupole and octopole .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite have detected a localised source of non - gaussianity , in the form of a very cold spot on the sky of angular scale @xmath7 .",
    "of particular interest to us , however , was the discovery of a remarkable asymmetry in large - scale power as measured in the two hemispheres of a particular reference frame .",
    "it remains unclear why this was not detected by the bipolar power spectrum of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this has provided the motivation to investigate anisotropic cosmological models .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we focus on a specific class of models ",
    "bianchi type vii@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such models were previously compared to the _",
    "cobe_-dmr data in @xcite , where limits on the shear @xmath8 and vorticity @xmath9 were established .",
    "we consider that the observed anisotropy is the sum of two contributions  an isotropic term which is connected to variations in the density and gravitational potential , and a term from the anisotropic metric .",
    "a mechanism to generate the isotropic fluctuations is required , particularly on small angular scales where the bianchi contribution is negligible , but this need not be inflationary .",
    "in our analysis we smooth the data to probe only the low-@xmath10 regime , and find that results are practically insensitive to the choice of spectrum for the isotropic component on large - angular scales .",
    "remarkably , we find a statistically significant correlation between one of these models and the _ wmap _ data .",
    "such a result may help to resolve some of the more unusual observed features of the microwave sky , albeit at the introduction of a new conundrum  the large - scale anisotropy is described at least in part by a low density bianchi model , whereas the smaller scale fluctuations are consistent with a cosmological constant dominated , critical density model in an inflationary scenario .",
    "in this analysis , we utilize the first - year _ wmap _ data in both raw and foreground template corrected forms @xcite and three heavily processed maps derived to minimize the foreground contribution in a template independent way ( wilc  @xcite ; lilc  @xcite ; toh ",
    "for the three ilc - like maps we consider the full sky in the analysis , whereas the kp2 or kp0 masks @xcite are imposed otherwise .",
    "all are smoothed to a common resolution of @xmath11 fwhm and downgraded to a healpix resolution of @xmath12 corresponding to harmonics up to @xmath13 .",
    "such processing does not compromise the analysis since the bianchi models exhibit little power outside of this @xmath10-range .    to assess the statistical significance of the fits we compare our results to an ensemble of 10000 lilc simulations , produced using the pipeline described by @xcite .",
    "the bianchi model templates are constructed using the formalism of @xcite .",
    "these models are parameterized by @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the scale on which basis vectors change orientation ) , and a handedness .",
    "these models have a prefered axis along which the expansion rate is different , and about which the basis vectors themselves rotate .",
    "the smaller the @xmath17 , the more rotation in a given distance traversed along a geodesic , and therefore the tighter the observed spiral pattern of induced temperature anisotropies .",
    "the smaller the @xmath14 , the larger is the asymmetry along the axis and the more focused is the structure in only one direction . in this analysis",
    ", we consider the range @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting temperature anisotropy pattern is described by equation 4.11 of @xcite .",
    "the fit amplitude determines the shear @xmath20 and the vorticity @xmath21 following equation 4.8 .",
    "in order to compute the correlation between the data @xmath22 and a template @xmath23 , we adopt the formalism of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "specifically , at a given frequency we estimate a template coupling constant @xmath24 by minimizing @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the cmb signal plus noise covariance matrix .",
    "the solution to this problem ( and corresponding uncertainty ) is @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the generalization to the multi - frequency case can be found in @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "the cmb signal covariance is specified by the _ wmap _",
    "best - fit theoretical power spectrum . in our analysis",
    ", we must determine @xmath24 over all possible models and , for each model , all relative rotations between the corresponding template and the data .",
    "such an analysis is generally computationally demanding , but can be accelerated by a full - sky harmonic - space approach . in this case , if the noise covariance is a diagonal approximation based on the mean noise level for the map under consideration then the denominator of @xmath24 is invariant under template rotation and simply computed for any given model .",
    "the numerator can then be evaluated from the convolution of the template and the `` whitened '' data map @xmath29 .",
    "this operation is performed using the total convolution method of @xcite to efficiently evaluate all such convolutions over all possible rotations .",
    "the technique is only straightforward when considering full sky coverage .",
    "thus , despite concerns about the effectiveness of foreground removal in the galactic plane , we analyse the foreground - cleaned lilc map .",
    "since chance alignments between the bianchi template and the cmb anisotropy arising even in the absence of rotation and shear can generate non - zero correlations , we follow @xcite and define the parameter @xmath30 to help reject this possibility at a given confidence and to select the best model . a reference ensemble of 10000 lilc simulations",
    "were analysed using the above formalism to establish the distribution of @xmath24 values and hence to estimate the significance of our best fit model .",
    "once the model and orientation axes are specified , we apply a pixel - based analysis to various combinations of the _ wmap _ sky maps and impose the conservative kp0 galactic cut to reduce foreground contamination , in order to confirm these results . in the case of incomplete sky analysis , the amount of template structure which is masked can affect the uncertainty of the fit . nevertheless , for the best fit orientation where the structure is largely outside the excluded galactic plane region , we find that the fit and its uncertainty are dominated by the cmb covariance rather than the particulars of the noise properties or sky cut .",
    "therefore , although we calibrate using simulations strictly only applicable to the lilc result , we expect that the predicted levels of chance alignment detections should be quite robust .",
    "the results from the analysis are summarized in table [ tab : amplitudes ] for our best fit model at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , right  handed .",
    "the excess power in the southern hemisphere requires a model with low @xmath14 to focus the spiral .",
    "the cold spot and surrounding structure effectively select the particular @xmath17 .",
    "see figure [ fig : maps ] .",
    "the best - fit euler angles for the wilc map were found to be @xmath31 , and in what follows this is adopted as the best - fit axis .",
    "however , both the lilc and toh sky maps as analysed on the full - sky yielded statistically consistent best - fit axes .",
    "this rotation places the center of the spiral structure , originally at the @xmath32 axis , at @xmath33 . for each map , we tabulate the sheer and vorticity , and corresponding estimate of significance as computed from the fraction of lilc simulations with a smaller @xmath24 value than the observed map .",
    "the estimated shear amplitudes are consistent with a value @xmath34 , significant at the 99.8% confidence level relative to the monte carlo ensemble .",

    "templates ) several difference maps were constructed from the _ wmap _ foreground corrected maps .",
    "the results indicate that foreground residuals are unlikely to result in spurious detections .    in figure",
    "[ fig : maps ] we show ( from top to bottom ) the wilc map , the best - fit bianchi model , and the difference between the two .",
    "it should be apparent that the `` bianchi corrected '' map exhibits greater isotropy than the wilc data .    in figure [",
    "fig : spectrum ] we compare the power spectra of the original and the bianchi - corrected v+w linear combination map . ] , as computed by the master algorithm @xcite for the kp2 sky coverage .",
    "it should be noted that , whilst the quadrupole amplitude is significantly increased , on average the bianchi - corrected map has slightly less power on large scales , although both corrected and uncorrected data are in good agreement for @xmath59 . more importantly , the general shape of the bianchi - corrected spectrum is flatter than for the _ wmap _ best - fit power spectrum , and in remarkable agreement with the theoretical fit made by @xcite to the northern hemisphere data ( defined in the reference frame which maximises the power asymmetry ) which favours a lower value for @xmath60 .",
    "* quadrupole amplitude * : the _ wmap _ team suggest that the quadrupole amplitude is significantly low , although other analyses have found it to be quite acceptable ( slosar & seljak 2004 ; odwyer et al .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : spectrum ] , the bianchi - corrected v+w map has a quadrupole amplitude of @xmath61 , compared to the uncorrected amplitude of @xmath62 and the _ wmap _ theoretical best - fit spectrum value of @xmath63 . in this context",
    ", the quadrupole amplitude should no longer be considered anomalous . whether the amplitude enhancement itself requires an unusual cancelation between the intrinsic and bianchi  induced quadrupoles , which could also be considered a fine - tuningof the model ,",
    "is deferred to a later analysis .",
    "* low-@xmath10 anomalies * : an alignment between the quadrupole and the octopole has been claimed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "quantitative calculations similar to those of @xcite and @xcite show that a stronger planarity is expected by chance with a probability of 52% for both the @xmath64 and 3 modes after subtracting the bianchi template .",
    "the angle between the preferred directions of the @xmath64 and 3 modes is @xmath65 after subtracting the bianchi template , compared to @xmath66 before .",
    "additionally , the @xmath67 and 6 modes ( eriksen et al .",
    "2004b ) become less anomalous , with significances dropping to @xmath68 in both cases .    *",
    "large - scale power asymmetry * : @xcite reported that the large - scale power ( @xmath69 ) in the _ wmap _ data is anisotropically distributed over two opposing hemispheres , with a significance of @xmath1 compared with simulations . repeating the analysis and adopting the kp2 sky coverage , we compare the corrected v+w _ wmap _ map with 2048 simulations .",
    "we find that 13.6% of the simulations have a larger maximum power asymmetry ratio than the bianchi - corrected map , whereas only 0.7% have a larger ratio than the uncorrected data .",
    "it is apparent that the maximum power ratio between any two hemispheres is significantly suppressed after subtracting the bianchi template  no asymmetry axis is found at any statistically significant level .    * wavelet kurtosis * : @xcite used a wavelet technique to detect an unusually cold spot ( @xmath70 significance relative to gaussian simulations ) at galactic coordinates @xmath71 .",
    "we repeat the analysis of @xcite , and compute the kurtosis of the wavelet coefficents as a function of scale from both the wilc and the corresponding bianchi - corrected map . for computational convenience , a galactic cut",
    "is imposed to exclude the region where @xmath72 .",
    "the results from this exercise are reported in figure [ fig : kurtosis ] .",
    "after subtracting the bianchi template , the southern hemisphere results are consistent with the 95% confidence intervals obtained from simulations  no non - gaussian features are apparent .",
    "we have considered the bianchi type vii@xmath0 class of anisotropic cosmological models and fitted the predicted cmb temperature anisotropy patterns to the first year _",
    "wmap _ data .",
    "the results are essentially independent of frequency or the method of foreground subtraction . a particular model with a rotation axis in the direction @xmath4 , shear @xmath73 and a right  handed vorticity @xmath74 yields the best fit to the data .",
    "an ongoing analysis will improve the accuracy and completeness of the search of the model space and examine other possibly significant models .",
    "should this result be considered more than a curiosity ?",
    "a skeptic would no doubt stress the inconsistency between those cosmological parameters describing the bianchi anisotropy pattern ( an open model with @xmath3 ) and the _ wmap _ best - fit cosmological power - spectrum which must account for the acoustic peaks . yet",
    "paradoxically , it is precisely the low value for @xmath14 which is required to allow the focussing of the bianchi anisotropy pattern into one hemisphere .",
    "the preferred bianchi model reconciles the observed asymmetric distribution of power on large angular scales , disrupts the observed planarity and alignment of the quadrupole and octopole moments , and provides an explanation for a highly non - gaussian signature on the sky ",
    "unexpected results given that the model was not selected based on these criteria , but solely on a statistical fit of the predicted anisotropy pattern to the _ wmap _ data .",
    "furthermore , the model is also consistent with the tentative result from @xcite that the estimated optical depth of @xmath75 on the ( nearly ) full sky @xcite could in large part originate in structure associated with the southern hemisphere ( in the reference frame which maximizes the power asymmetry ) .",
    "while the consistency of our result on large angular scales with models for the small - scale anisotropy remains ambiguous , we note that the models considered include no dark energy contribution",
    ". a more self - consistent approach is clearly warranted , but we propose that the result is sufficiently provocative to encourage a renewed exploration of anisotropic models in a broader cosmological parameter space .",
