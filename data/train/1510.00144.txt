    "ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices provide a unique platform to probe a wide range of quantum phenomena with a high degree of controllability . the success of the bose - hubbard ( bh ) hamiltonian  @xcite in elucidating the behavior of ultracold bosons in optical lattices has stimulated a great deal of interest , from theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "in particular , the seminal work on the mott insulator ( mi ) to superfluid ( sf ) quantum phase transition ( qpt )  @xcite paved the way for a number of studies that led to the observation of various exotic quantum phases  @xcite .",
    "non - equilibrium quantum effects in such systems can be investigated by varying in time parameters such as the optical lattice depth or the magnetic field close to a feshbach resonance .",
    "such experimental possibilities have spurred a renewed interest in the study of both sudden and quasi - adiabatic quenches  @xcite .",
    "the latter would provide important insights into non - equilibrium quantum phase transitions . in the presence of a ground - state energy gap always being finite during a very slow time evolution",
    ", the adiabatic theorem guarantees that the system will remain in the instantaneous ground state of the corresponding time - dependent hamiltonian .",
    "however if a gapless region is crossed , the system will be unable to stay in its equilibrium ground state , regardless of how slowly it is quenched .",
    "the non - adiabatic evolution inevitably excites the system and a number of defects will appear in the evolved state .",
    "the mechanism of such defects formation had been first addressed by kibble and zurek ( kz ) in the context of classical phase transitions in the early universe  @xcite , and more recently extended to the quantum regime for the case of adiabatic quenches across a single quantum critical point  @xcite .",
    "the possibility to apply this kind of quenches has led to a number of theoretical studies addressing different types of many - body systems , including spin chains and ultracold quantum gases ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . despite the large body of work in this field ,",
    "several aspects involving the response of such systems to slow quenches have not been completely understood and deserve further investigation .",
    "it is believed that , in presence of non - isolated critical points or of extended critical regions , the validity of the kz mechanism is a priori not obvious , even if in some cases it is still possible to predict the defect density by identifying a dominant critical point , or by using scaling arguments  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of ultracold bosons in an optical lattice subjected to a quasi - adiabatic quench has been theoretically analyzed for the mi - sf as well as the reverse transition  @xcite .",
    "the sf - mi transition for a slow quench has been also studied taking the effects of the parabolic trapping potential into account  @xcite .",
    "these results highlighted the emergence of a scaling behavior for the characteristic length scale as a function of the quench rate , which is well approximated by a power law .",
    "however it has been later shown that , for a phase transition of the kosterlitz - thouless type ( as is the case for the mi - sf transition in the one - dimensional bh model ) , the exponents depend on that rate , and are generally different from the kz prediction , based on the critical exponents that are relevant for asymptotically long quench times  @xcite . experimental evidence in support of the growth of the condensate excitations with a power - law dependence on the quench rate has been observed for the mi - sf transition for ultracold bosons in an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for the same transition in a similar system , the observation of the emergence of coherence and a power - law dependence of the correlation length on the quench rate for intermediate quenches has recently been reported  @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of superposing different optical lattices with distinct frequencies  @xcite also made the study of local relaxation dynamics possible in such superlattice setups  @xcite .",
    "an interesting property of these composite structures when they are loaded with bosonic atoms is that they can facilitate the generation of multiple lattice - modulated mi phases , which can isolate sf regions in the parameter space of the system  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , slow quenches for qpts in optical superlattices starting and ending in insulating phases , and crossing a superfluid region in between ,",
    "have not been addressed so far , and this is the focus of our present work .",
    "here we consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system of ultracold bosonic atoms loaded in an optical superlattice , formed by two superimposed optical standing waves with different frequencies . at zero temperature",
    ", this system exhibits different quantum phases : mi , sf and a superlattice - induced mi ( slmi ) with periodically modulated onsite occupation  @xcite .",
    "the superlattice potential is constructed as to vary linearly in time , and is chosen in such a way that it crosses a gapless region in between two insulating regions .",
    "we consider the formation of defects in the final state after the quench , and demonstrate a non - trivial scaling of the excess energy as a function of the quench rate .",
    "we tackle this problem by means of the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , in the formalism of matrix - product - state ansatz  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start introducing our model and discussing the static properties of its ground - state phase diagram that are relevant to the ongoing discussion ( sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quench ] we define our dynamical protocol and discuss the formation of defects and the behavior of two - point correlation functions at the end of the protocol . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "the model is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denote the creation and annihilation operators on site @xmath2 satisfying the usual bosonic commutation rules , with @xmath3 being the corresponding number operator .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 denotes the hopping amplitude , @xmath5 is the on - site repulsive interaction strength and @xmath6 quantifies the superlattice potential depth . for the period - two optical superlattice that we have considered , @xmath6 has a finite value of @xmath7 for odd sites , and it is zero for even sites .",
    "hereafter we work in units of @xmath8 and set @xmath9 as the energy scale .",

    "the ground - state phase diagram of model   has been studied by means of mean field theory  @xcite , quantum monte carlo techniques  @xcite and the dmrg method  @xcite . in 1d and at integer filling @xmath20 , this is given in the @xmath14-@xmath5 plane as in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] . here",
    "we identify the various phases by analyzing the behavior of the ground - state energy gap @xmath19 as a function of the system size in the following way .",
    "first we observe that , for a mi , this is finite and coincides with the charge gap @xmath21 , that is the difference between the energy cost to add ( @xmath22 ) and to remove ( @xmath23 ) a particle from the system . on a chain of finite length @xmath24 ,",
    "the numerical evaluation of the mott gap has been thus obtained by performing three dmrg iterations , with projections on different number sectors @xmath25 .",
    "the corresponding ground states respectively give the desired energies @xmath26 , @xmath27 . in the sf region",
    ", this gap vanishes as the inverse of the system size @xmath24 .",
    "the critical points have been extracted as those in which the product @xmath28 for the smallest ( @xmath29 ) and the largest ( @xmath30 ) considered lengths differed more than four percent ( see the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "the nature of the insulating phase ( mi or slmi ) depends on the relative strength of @xmath5 and @xmath14 .",
    "a sf region is present in between these two insulators , and its width decreases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the intervening sf phase arises because of the competition between the superlattice potential @xmath14 and the on - site two - body interaction @xmath5 . for @xmath31",
    ", there is only a transition from a gapless sf to a gapped slmi at a critical value of @xmath14 .",
    "but for @xmath32 , there are three possible scenarios .",
    "if @xmath14 is much smaller than @xmath5 , the system remains in the mi phase .",
    "when it becomes comparable to @xmath5 , the system makes a transition to the sf phase , and for large values of @xmath14 it enters the slmi phase .",
    "in order to probe the slow quench dynamics of ultracold atoms in an optical superlattice , eq .  , it is necessary to analyze the excitations that are generated when the gapless sf phase is crossed . in view of the specific features of the phase diagram ,",
    "it is convenient to fix a value of @xmath5 and increase the parameter @xmath14 , so as to drive the system across the mi - to - sf and then the sf - to - slmi phase transitions . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] , the width of the critical region changes with @xmath5 .",
    "this reflects into a non trivial dependence of the rate of defects generation with @xmath5 , as discussed later .",
    "we adopt a linear variation in time of the superlattice potential @xmath14 , which is given by @xmath33 here @xmath34 denotes the time of the quench , while @xmath35 and @xmath36 are respectively the initial and the final values of the superlattice potential . after fixing the value of @xmath5",
    ", we choose @xmath35 and @xmath37 such that the system starts from a mi and ends in a slmi phase ( except for the cases with @xmath31 , where there is no mi phase ) . in between the initial and the final insulating phases ,",
    "there is a sf region , whose width depends on @xmath5 . due to the presence of a gapless region at the thermodynamic limit @xmath38 , a certain number of defects in the final state after the evolution will appear , no matter how slowly the quenching is performed  @xcite .",
    "below we shed light on these defects .",
    "the system wavefunction @xmath39 evolves according to the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "we computed @xmath40 at the final time @xmath34 after the quench  , using a time - evolving block - decimation strategy  @xcite .",
    "we simulated systems up to @xmath41 sites with no more than @xmath42 bosons per site , and used open boundary conditions .",
    "the time interval @xmath43 $ ] has been discretized into many slices of time - length @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is assumed to be constant . the corresponding time evolution operator @xmath46 has been expanded by means of a sixth - order suzuki - trotter decomposition  @xcite .",
    "we have been able to consider a time - step @xmath47 , and reach a threshold for the discarded states @xmath48 , by using a bond - link dimension @xmath49 for all our simulations  @xcite .      to quantify the defects generation due to the non - adiabatic crossing of the sf region during the time evolution , we focus on the residual energy @xmath50 , defined as the excess energy above the ground state : @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the energy of the system at time @xmath53 , while @xmath54 is the instantaneous ground - state energy for hamiltonian @xmath12 at time @xmath53 .",
    "this quantity serves as analog of the defect density originally considered by kibble and zurek ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "let us now discuss its behavior after a time modulation of the superlattice depth @xmath55 , from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , as dictated by eq .  .",
    "in particular we focus on the scaling of @xmath58 with @xmath34 for different values of interaction @xmath5 .",
    "the typical scenario is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltae_tau]a , where we are able to distinguish three distinct behaviors as a function of the quench time . for @xmath59",
    ", the dynamics is ruled by the adiabatic regime typical of slow quenches : the time - evolved wavefunction remains very close to the instantaneous ground state of @xmath60 .",
    "the residual energy follows a power - law behavior @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "this exponent can be obtained within the landau - zener formalism  @xcite , where the quantum evolution is studied by means of an effective two - level approximation with an avoided level crossing .",
    "we point out that the adiabatic regime can occur only in the presence of an instantaneous ground - state energy gap which remains finite along the sweeping   ( _ i.e. _ , for quenches much slower than the inverse square of the minimum crossed gap , @xmath63 ) .",
    "therefore this is a behavior related to a finite - size effect , which disappears at the thermodynamic limit where the gap in the superfluid region is rigorously zero . in the opposite regime of fast quenches ( @xmath64 ) ,",
    "the dynamics is strongly non adiabatic and the initial state is essentially frozen during the evolution .",
    "the excess energy thus saturates with @xmath34 .",
    "the intermediate regime in between is the most interesting one , since it is crucially affected by the critical properties of the region crossed by the system .    in the intermediate regime",
    ", our data display a power - law scaling of the type in eq .  .",
    "this fairly agrees with the general behavior predicted by kz and verified in many cases , when the system is adiabatically driven across isolated quantum critical points  @xcite .",
    "the kz mechanism roughly identifies two types of evolution , either adiabatic or impulsive , according to the distance from the critical point .",
    "the time ( distance from the critical point ) at which the system switches to the impulsive regime depends on the quench velocity .",
    "this simple argument indeed predicts a power - law scaling form for @xmath65 as a function of @xmath34 , with a rate @xmath66 expressed in terms of the critical exponents dictating the phase transition .",
    "however , for the crossing of continuous phase transitions with extended critical regions , as it is in our case , the kz scaling may still give insightful information , but can not be regarded as ultimately predictive . in the specific case of a kosterlitz - thouless transition analogous to that occurring in the bh model at @xmath11 , it has been shown that the exponentially slow gap closure induces a power - law scaling which generally depends on the quench rate .",
    "the exponent differs from that obtained with the usual kz mechanism using the critical exponents of the transition  @xcite . in our specific situation ,",
    "the system is quenched from a gapped to a gapless phase , and then to another gapped phase , thus crossing two qpts and an extended critical ( sf ) region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] , for fixed @xmath32 ) .",
    "this is an even more complex scenario , where it is impossible to grasp the quantitative power - law scaling predicted by kz , and hence we expect the emergence of a more complex and inhomogeneous behavior , in terms of the size of the crossed critical region . in the case of",
    "@xmath67 we clearly identify an intermediate scaling region with @xmath68 , as extracted from fits of the numerical data ( see the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltae_tau]a , denoting the best fit of the data series at the size @xmath69 ) .",
    "our results do not display a significant dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath24 .",
    "notice also that the excess energy per unit length is universal in the scaling region , whose width increases with @xmath24 , due to the gap closure in the sf phase ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltae_tau]a ) .",
    "a qualitatively similar behavior is observed for a quench from sf to slmi phase , at fixed @xmath31fig .",
    "[ fig : deltae_tau]b , blue circles , shows an example with @xmath16 .",
    "the value @xmath70 in the intermediate region obtained for that case is considerably larger than that for @xmath67 .     and a system size @xmath71 for different initial and final points . ]",
    "these observations support the evidence that any appropriate scaling analysis should depend non trivially on @xmath5 , while a simple kz argument can not predict this complex behavior .",
    "we point out that it is also not guaranteed that @xmath66 does not change with the quench rate , as theoretically predicted for the mi - sf transition at @xmath11  @xcite . in the range of @xmath34",
    "we were able to address , we did not observe such dependence .",
    "however , as reported in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltae_tau]b , for quenches across the phases mi @xmath72 sf @xmath72 slmi with @xmath32 , we found a rather complex dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath5 , and hence on the width of the intermediate sf region .",
    "in particular the defects production rate @xmath66 decreases monotonically as a function of the time during which the system is crossing the gapless region .",
    "we also checked the dependence of @xmath66 on the starting and ending points inside the insulator ( we varied @xmath73 and @xmath37 , for fixed @xmath5 ) .",
    "results in fig .  [",
    "fig : u5_lambdavar ] indicate a tendency toward a slight decrease of @xmath66 , if the gapped region crossed by the quench increases .",
    "finally we examined the behavior of the two - point correlation function @xmath74 at the end of the quasi - adiabatic dynamics , and observed an exponential decay with the distance @xmath75 , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : corr_length_u8 ] .",
    "the two points @xmath2 and @xmath76 have been chosen in a symmetric way with respect to the center of the chain in order to minimize boundary effects , such that @xmath77 , @xmath78 for odd @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , @xmath81 for even @xmath79 ( for instance , for @xmath71 sites , @xmath82 corresponds to @xmath83 , @xmath84 ; @xmath85 corresponds to @xmath86 , @xmath84 ; @xmath87 corresponds to @xmath86 , @xmath88 , and so on ) .    in the inset we plot the correlation function @xmath89 this clearly exhibits a non - monotonic behavior as a function of the quench rate @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "in particular we notice that @xmath90 is increasing initially in the intermediate scaling region .",
    "this can be attributed to the persistence of quasi - long range order which the system gained while quenching through the sf phase .",
    "but after some critical value of @xmath34 , we observe that @xmath91 starts to decrease .",
    "such a behavior is ascribed to the onset of adiabatic regime .",
    "since the system ends up in an insulating phase ( slmi ) , where the correlation function decays exponentially , we expect in the adiabatic regime the correlation length to be small .",
    "in particular , the value of @xmath34 at which the transition from the intermediate regime to the adiabatic regime takes place , obtained from the analysis of the residual energy ( fig .  [ fig : deltae_tau ] ) coincides with that seen in the correlation length ( fig .  [",
    "fig : corr_length_u8 ] ) .     as a function of the distance @xmath75 and for different quench times , @xmath34 .",
    "the inset shows the correlation length @xmath91 as extracted from numerical data as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "data are for @xmath67 and @xmath92 . here",
    "we set @xmath71 .",
    "distances are in units of the lattice spacing . ]",
    "we have theoretically analyzed the slow quench dynamics of ultracold bosonic atoms in a one - dimensional optical superlattice . by considering a linear time dependence of the superlattice potential",
    ", we showed that , when crossing a gapless superfluid region , the system has the tendency to generate defects .",
    "this fact is due to the adiabaticity loss during the time evolution , which occurs even when the system is quenched very slowly .",
    "our results show a complex dependence of the rate of defect generation on the quench velocity , which can not be understood in terms of the kibble - zurek physics underlying the crossing of a single critical point .    from an experimental point of view , the behavior of the excess energy could be verified by means of time - of - flight measurements of the correlation length .",
    "this , in turn , may reveal itself as a simple indicator of the presence or absence of the power - law scaling regime for the defects production as a function of the quench velocity .",
    "trapping ultracold bosonic atoms in optical standing waves is probably the most favourable setup to probe this kind of physics .",
    "recent experiments have already verified the power - law behavior  @xcite in the framework of the bose - hubbard model . moreover",
    ", the capability that has been demonstrated by a variety of out - of - equilibrium experiments with great accuracy and for large coherence times , ranging from sudden quenches to adiabatic variation of the system s parameters , puts our results arising from the quenching of the superlattice potential in a favourable position for verification in the laboratory .",
