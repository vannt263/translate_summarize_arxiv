    "graphical models of codes and the decoding algorithms associated with them are now a major focus area of research in coding theory . turbo codes , low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes , and expander codes are all examples of codes defined , in one way or another , on underlying graphs . a unified treatment of graphical models and the associated decoding algorithms began with the work of wiberg , loeliger and koetter @xcite,@xcite , and has since been abstracted and refined under the framework of the generalized distributive law @xcite , factor graphs @xcite , and normal realizations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the particular case of graphical models in which the underlying graphs are cycle - free has a long and rich history of its own , starting with the study of trellis representations of codes ; see _ e.g. _ , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "briefly , a graphical model consists of a graph , an assignment of symbol variables to the vertices of the graph , an assignment of state variables to the edges of the graph , and a specification of local constraint codes at each vertex of the graph .",
    "the full behavior of the model is the set of all configurations of symbol and state variables that satisfy all the local constraints .",
    "such a model is called a realization of a code @xmath0 if the restriction of the full behavior to the set of symbol variables is precisely @xmath0 .",
    "the realization is said to be cycle - free if the underlying graph in the model has no cycles .",
    "a trellis representation of a code can be viewed as a cycle - free realization in which the underlying graph is a simple path .",
    "a linear code @xmath0 has a realization on a graph @xmath1 that is not connected if and only if @xmath0 can be expressed as the direct sum of the codes that are individually realized on the connected components of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , there is no loss of generality in just focusing , as we do , on the case of realizations on connected graphs . in this paper , we will be concerned with tree realizations  cycle - free realizations in which the underlying cycle - free graph is connected , _",
    "i.e. _ , is a tree .",
    "it is by now well known that the sum - product algorithm on any tree realization provides an exact implementation of maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . a good initial estimate of the computational complexity of such an implementation is given by the constraint complexity of the realization , which is the maximum dimension of any of the local constraint codes in the realization .",
    "now , distinct tree realizations of the same code have , in general , distinct constraint complexities .",
    "the treewidth of a code is defined to be the least constraint complexity of any of its tree realizations .",
    "thus , treewidth may be taken to be a measure of the ml decoding complexity of a code .",
    "since trellis realizations are instances of tree realizations , the treewidth of a code can be no larger than the minimum constraint complexity of any of its trellis realizations . in the abstract of his paper @xcite",
    ", forney claimed that `` the constraint complexity of a general cycle - free graph realization can be [ strictly ] less than that of any conventional trellis realization , but not by very much . '' while he substantiated the first part of his claim by means of an example , he left the `` not by very much '' part as a conjecture ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , conjecture  2 ) .",
    "but he also admitted that none of the arguments he gave in support of his conjecture `` is very persuasive , '' and that it is equally plausible that ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture  3 ) there exists no upper bound on the gap between the treewidth of a code and the minimum constraint complexity of any of its trellis realizations .",
    "one of the main contributions of this paper is an example that affirms the validity of forney s conjecture  3 .",
    "we present , in section  [ complexity_section ] , a family of codes for which the difference between the minimum trellis constraint complexity and the treewidth grows logarithmically with codelength .",
    "we conjecture that this is in fact the maximal rate of growth of this difference .",
    "our construction of this example is based upon results from the graph theory and matroid theory literatures that connect the notions of treewidth and trellis complexity of a code to certain complexity measures defined for graphs .",
    "this paper makes two other contributions , both relating to minimal tree realizations .",
    "a mapping of the set of coordinates of a code @xmath0 to the vertices of a tree is called a tree decomposition .",
    "a tree decomposition may be viewed as an assignment of symbol variables to the vertices of the tree .",
    "it is known that given a code @xmath0 , among all tree realizations of @xmath0 that extend a given tree decomposition , there is one that minimizes the state space dimension at each vertex of the underlying tree @xcite .",
    "this minimal tree realization , an explicit construction of which was also given in @xcite , is unique up to isomorphism .",
    "we give two new constructions of minimal tree realizations .",
    "the first construction involves a generalization of the idea of state merging that can be used to construct minimal trellis realizations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  4 ) .",
    "we show that any tree realization of a code can be converted to a minimal realization by a sequence of state merging transformations .",
    "the state space and constraint code dimensions do not increase at any step of this process . from this , we obtain the fact that a minimal realization also minimizes the constraint code dimension at each vertex of the underlying tree .",
    "our second construction of minimal tree realizations uses extensions of the code decomposition techniques that were presented in @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of this construction is its recursive nature , which makes it suitable for mechanical implementation .",
    "also , it is relatively straightforward to estimate the computational complexity of this construction .",
    "we show that the complexity is polynomial in the length and dimension of the code , as well as in the size of the underlying tree , but is exponential in the state - complexity of the minimal realization , which is the maximum dimension of any state space in the realization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ background_section ]",
    ", we provide the necessary background on tree realizations of linear codes .",
    "the construction of minimal realizations by means of state merging is presented in section  [ state_merging_section ] .",
    "code decomposition techniques are developed in section  [ decomp_section ] , and used in section  [ new_construct_section ] to derive a recursive construction of minimal tree realizations .",
    "proofs of some of the results from sections  [ background_section][new_construct_section ] are deferred to appendices to preserve the flow of the exposition .",
    "treewidth and related complexity measures are defined in section  [ complexity_section ] , which also establishes connections between these code complexity measures and certain complexity measures defined for graphs .",
    "these connections are used to derive the example of a code family for which the gap between minimum trellis constraint complexity and treewidth is arbitrarily large .",
    "we also touch upon the subject of codes of bounded complexity , observing that many hard coding - theoretic problems become polynomial - time solvable when restricted to code families whose treewidth is bounded .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] contains a few concluding remarks .",
    "our treatment of the topic of tree realizations in this section is based on the exposition of forney @xcite,@xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "we start by establishing some basic notation .",

    ". we will only consider linear codes in this paper , so the terms `` code '' and `` linear code '' will be used interchangeably .",
    "the dimension , over @xmath2 , of @xmath0 will be denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "an @xmath13 $ ] code is a code of length @xmath14 and dimension @xmath15 .",
    "if , additionally , the code has minimum distance @xmath16 , then the code is an @xmath17 $ ] code .",
    "the dual code of @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath18 , and is defined on the same index set as @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath19 be a subset of the index set @xmath3 .",
    "the _ projection _ of @xmath0 onto @xmath19 is the code @xmath20 , which is a subspace of @xmath21 .",
    "we will use @xmath22 to denote the _ cross - section _ of @xmath0 consisting of all projections @xmath23 of codewords @xmath24 that satisfy @xmath25 . to be precise , @xmath26 . note that @xmath27 .",
    "also , since @xmath22 is isomorphic to the kernel of the projection map @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 , we have that @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , projections and cross - sections are dual notions , in the sense that @xmath31 , and similarly , @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are codes over @xmath2 defined on mutually disjoint index sets @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , then their _ direct sum _ is the code @xmath37 defined on the index set @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
