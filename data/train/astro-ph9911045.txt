    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; defined as those systems with luminosity from 8 - 1000 @xmath0 m l@xmath3 ) were discovered to be a significant class of objects in the local universe in the iras all sky survey ( soifer et al .",
    "1987 , sanders et al . 1988 ) .",
    "these systems have recently been suggested as a major component in the universe at z@xmath4 2 through deep submillimeter surveys ( c.f .",
    "lilly et al . 1999 , blain et al . 1999 ,",
    "barger et al . 1998 ) .    whether ulirgs are powered by dust",
    "enshrouded agn or starbursts has been debated since their discovery(e.g .",
    "sanders 1999 , joseph 1999 ) .",
    "this question is made all the more important by the realization that ulirgs could produce a major fraction of the radiant energy in the universe ( lilly et al .",
    "1999 , heckmann 1998 ) .    a wide variety of observational techniques have been employed to probe the nature of the central luminosity source in ulirgs , ranging from optical spectroscopy ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 ) to cm radio continuum imaging ( condon et al .",
    "1991 , hereafter c91 ) , to vlbi observations ( smith , lonsdale and lonsdale 1998 ) and hard x - ray observations ( rieke 1988 , nakagawa et al .",
    "1998 , isawawa 1999 ) .",
    "the nuclear environments of these galaxies have been effectively imaged with high spatial resolution in the optical and near infrared ( surace et al .",
    "1998 , surace and sanders 1999 , scoville et al .",
    "1999 , hereafter s99 ) .",
    "observations in the thermal infrared have the potential to address the question of the origin of the luminosity by establishing the size of the regions that are radiating the infrared luminosity .",
    "the iras observations showed that the mid and far infrared luminosity in these systems emerging predominantly between 50 and 200 @xmath0 m was due to thermal reradiation by dust .",
    "however , the spatial resolution of those observations , @xmath5 , was inadequate to place meaningful size constraints on the luminosity sources . because the mid - infrared wavelengths ( 825@xmath0 m ) carry a significant fraction of the total bolometric luminosity in ulirgs , ranging from @xmath610% to @xmath4 30% of the 81000@xmath0 m luminosity , observations at these wavelengths with a resolution @xmath7 have the potential to constrain the sizes of the emitting regions and thereby address the nature of the underlying sources that heat the radiating dust .",
    "observations in the 10@xmath0 m atmospheric window , with a resolution @xmath8 , have been reported for several ulirgs by miles et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and keto et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . in most cases they found the sources to be unresolved implying that the sources were either very compact starbursts or dust enshrouded agn .    with a diffraction limit of 0.24@xmath2 fwhm at 10@xmath0 m",
    ", the keck telescope provides a substantial improvement in spatial resolution over previous mid - infrared observations , probing the distribution of the thermal emission at the 100 - 300 pc scale in nearby ulirgs . with the introduction of mid - infrared imaging on the keck telescope",
    ", we have started a program to address this problem .",
    "in the first paper from this program we reported imaging of the nucleus of the closest ulirg - arp 220 ( soifer et al .",
    "the observations were able to spatially resolve the emission at 24.5@xmath0 m , and demonstrated that the central thermal source is optically thick at this wavelength .",
    "these observations placed severe constraints on the surface brightness in the infrared luminous nuclei .",
    "in this paper we report imaging observations from 8 - 24.5@xmath0 m of a sample of the closest ulirgs at spatial resolutions of 0.3 - 0.6@xmath2 .",
    "these data provide the highest spatial resolution yet achieved on the thermal emission from the closest ulirgs and trace the spatial distribution of the emergent luminosity in these systems .",
    "we adopt h@xmath9 = 75 km s@xmath10mpc@xmath10 .",
    "the objects observed were taken from the iras bright galaxy sample ( soifer et al .",
    "1987 ) with the addition of iras 17208 - 0014 ( sanders et al .",
    "1995 ) , which is at a low galactic latitude .",
    "the basic information for the seven objects in the sample is given in table 1 .",
    "the objects selected for observation were chosen on the basis of 1 ) meeting the luminosity definition of the ulirgs , i.e. @xmath11 @xmath12 , 2 ) having a 25@xmath0 m flux density @xmath4 1 jy based on iras measurements , 3 ) being at the lowest possible redshift for the best linear resolution , and 4 ) being available at the time of the observations .",
    "this sample contains the five closest ulirgs in the iras bright galaxy sample of soifer et al . , and seven of the ten ulirgs known with @xmath13 and z@xmath140.06 .",
    "the projected linear scales of these objects range from 360 pc arcsec@xmath10 to 1200 pc arcsec@xmath10 , so that the point spread function / angular resolution of the keck observations , 0.3@xmath2 at 12@xmath0 m and 0.6@xmath2 at 24.5@xmath0 m provide linear resolutions of 100  pc - 700  pc , depending on the object and the wavelength observed .",
    "three of the objects in the sample have been classified as seyfert nuclei , three as liners , and one as an hii region , based on optical spectroscopy .",
    "the observations were made primarily using the mirlin mid - infrared camera ( ressler et al .",
    "1994 ) at the f/40 bent cassegrain visitor port of the keck ii telescope .",
    "the camera uses a 128@xmath15128 si : as array with a plate scale of 0.138@xmath2/pixel for a total field of view of 17@xmath1617@xmath2 .",
    "table 2 reports the central wavelengths for the filters through which each object was observed . at each wavelength",
    "the observing procedure was the same .",
    "a secondary with a square wave chop of amplitude 6@xmath2 in the north - south or east - west direction at 4 hz was employed for fast beam switching .",
    "the frames sampling each chop position were coadded separately in hardware , resulting in two images . after an interval of approximately a minute",
    ", the telescope was nodded perpendicular to the chop direction ( east - west or north - south ) by 6@xmath2 and a second pair of images was obtained in order to cancel residuals in the sky and to subtract telescope emission .",
    "this procedure was repeated a number of times at each wavelength .",
    "the data were reduced by differencing the two images obtained within the chop pairs at each nod location , and then coadding the resulting positive images , with the positions appropriately adjusted to a common location , to yield a positive image centered in a field approximately 6@xmath166@xmath2 . because of the chopper and telescope nod spacings employed for the observations , the data are not capable of measuring flux outside a 6@xmath2 diameter region .",
    "observations with mirlin of all the ulirgs except iras  05189 - 2524 were obtained in two nights in march 1998 .",
    "the observations of the targets were interleaved with observations of nearby bright stars that were used to establish the point spread function ( psf ) for the observations .",
    "the psf stars were observed only three times per night in each of the bands at 12.5 , 17.9 and 24.5  @xmath0 m , but an attempt was made to accompany the critical observations with measurements of a nearby psf star . at 24.5  @xmath0 m the psf was always equal to the diffraction limit of the telescope to be 0.62@xmath2 fwhm . at the shorter wavelengths ,",
    "the size of the psf image was set by diffraction and the pixel sampling about half of the time ; at other times atmospheric seeing affected the image size .",
    "iras  05189 - 2524 was observed in october 1998 . during this run the psf stars",
    "were observed more frequently , but for wavelengths shorter than @xmath17 17.9  @xmath0 m significant variation in the measured size of the psf star was seen .",
    "the variation in the measured size of the psf calibration star is the largest uncertainty in the measurement of the source sizes ; this issue is addressed when observations of a particular object are described .",
    "the mirlin observations were made under photometric conditions .",
    "the photometry was calibrated based on observations of four bright stars , @xmath18 tau , @xmath18 boo , @xmath19 peg , and @xmath18 cet whose magnitudes , in turn , were based on iras photometry . the uncertainties in the photometry , based on the internal consistency of the observations , is estimated to be 5% at @xmath2017.9  @xmath0 m and 10% at 24.5  @xmath0 m .",
    "the flux density corresponding to 0.0 mag ( vega - based ) was taken to follow the prescription given in the explanatory supplement to the iras catalogs and atlases ( joint iras science team , 1989 ) , and is given in soifer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "in addition to the mirlin observations , ugc  5101 , markarian 231 and iras  08572 + 3915 were observed using the long wavelength spectrograph on the keck  i telescope on the night of 01 april 1999 .",
    "the night was not photometric and so only measurements of the sizes of the compact sources were made ; all the observations were carried out at 12.5  @xmath0 m .",
    "the chopper was set to an amplitude of 5@xmath2 chopping north - south at a frequency @xmath6 5 hz . observations were made in a fashion similar to the mirlin observations , except that the telescope nodding was in the same direction as the chopping and the nodding amplitude was the same as the chopping amplitude .",

    "the mid - infrared observations of the ulirgs reported here show a variety of characteristics , generally consistent with their properties seen at high spatial resolution at radio wavelengths ( c.f .",

    "the mid - infrared observations did not establish accurate absolute positions for the sources . in some cases , described below , we use arguments regarding the similarities of the structures seen at vastly different wavelengths to argue for the physical coincidence of the sources seen at different wavelengths .    in the following sections we give results for the individual objects .",
    "mirlin observations of iras  05189@xmath212524 were made at 12.5 and 24.5 @xmath0 m .",

    "as can be seen from figure 2 , there is excellent agreement between the curve of growth for iras  05189 - 2524 and the psf star observation .",
    "the apparent size of the psf star varied during the time of the observations , so the limit on the size of iras  05189 - 2524 is not as stringent as would otherwise be achieved . at 12.5@xmath0 m the size is @xmath240.2@xmath2 ( table 4 ) .",
    "the source size at 24.5  @xmath0 m is an upper limit as well , and is larger and thus consistent with that established at 12.5  @xmath0 m .    as seen in figure 3 and table 3 ,",
    "the flux densities measured by mirlin at 12.5  @xmath0 m and 24.5  @xmath0 m agree well with the iras observations of this source ; virtually all of the luminosity of this source at 12.5  @xmath0 m and 24.5  @xmath0 m is contained within the unresolved source measured here .",
    "the mirlin observations of iras  05189@xmath212524 lead to a limit on the source diameter of @xmath24170 pc in the mid - infrared ( table 5 ) .",
    "the combination of flux density and upper limit on the source sizes(table 4 ) , imply the brightness temperatures t@xmath25123  k and @xmath485  k at 12.5  @xmath0 m and 24.5  @xmath0 m respectively .",
    "the flux ratio between 12.5  @xmath0 m and 24.5  @xmath0 m corresponds to a color temperature t@xmath26169  k , while the color temperature derived from the 25@xmath0 m and 60@xmath0 m iras measurements is 83  k.    a central source with the bolometric luminosity of iras 05189@xmath212524 would heat silicate or graphite grains to the apparent color temperature between 12 and 24.5@xmath0 m , t@xmath27 170  k , at a radius of 30 - 60 pc using the grain parameters of draine and lee ( 1984 ) .",

    "as illustrated in figure 2 , there appears to be a measureable flux , approximately 20% of the total at 12.5  @xmath0 m , that extends beyond the central core , and is contained within 4@xmath2 .",
    "the figure shows clearly that the flux measured in iras  08572 + 3915 continues to increase beyond the beam where the flux in the psf star has stopped increasing .",
    "figure 3 and table 3 compare the keck photometry in a 4@xmath2 diameter beam for iras  08572 + 3915 with the iras measurements . the mirlin photometry accounts for 70% of the iras flux density at 12.5@xmath0 m .",
    "the mirlin observations were taken with comparatively narrow filters , i.e. , @xmath31/@xmath32 0.1 , from 7.9@xmath0 m to 17.9@xmath0 m , while the iras 12@xmath0 m filter bandpass extends from 8 - 15@xmath0 m .",
    "given the uncertainties in the corrections for the different bandpasses , the mirlin data are consistent with all the flux detected by iras being confined to a 4@xmath2 diameter beam surrounding the detected source although it is possible that some of the flux could be accounted for by extended emission associated with the northwest source or from the southeastern source .    neither the mirlin nor the lws observations detected the galaxy approximately 5@xmath2 southeast of the object centered in figure 1b .",
    "the mirlin data limit the contribution of the southeastern source to @xmath2430% of the total 12.5@xmath0 m flux ; it is likely that the southeast galaxy does not contribute significantly to the total infrared luminosity in this system .",

    "while the position angle of the elliptical structures agree well at 2.2@xmath0 m and 8.4 ghz , there is a suggestion that the position angle of the ellipse at 12.5  @xmath0 m is @xmath615@xmath33 smaller . at 8.4",
    "ghz the central source contains 80% of the radio flux(c91 ) , while at 2.2@xmath0 m , the unresolved peak contains 35% of the flux in a 5@xmath2 diameter beam ( s99 ) .",

    "the sed of figure 5 , particularly the relatively strong emission at 3.5 and 11.7 @xmath0 m , suggests aromatic hydrocarbon emission ( pah ) emission associated with the southwest nucleus .",
    "such emission is seen in the spectra of many ulirgs ( genzel et al .",
    "the emission from the southwest source could account for all of the 11.3@xmath0 m emission seen in the spectrum of the combined nuclei by dudley(1999).the northern source does not show a similar peak at 11.7@xmath0 m , but clearly shows the effects of substantial overlaying cold silicate absorption .    the mirlin photometry shown in figure 3",
    "was obtained using a 4@xmath2 diameter beam centered between the two nuclei .",
    "the comparison of the mirlin and iras data ( figure 3 ) demonstrates that the mid - infrared emission in this source emerges virtually entirely from the central region . because of the proximity of the two nuclei and the fairly low signal - to - noise ratio of the nuclei in some of the images , it is difficult to cleanly determine the sizes of the two sources .",

    "the source flux smoothly increases up to 5@xmath2 diameter , with a fwhm of 2@xmath2 ; the apparent leveling off of the enclosed flux at a diamteter of 5@xmath2 is caused by the artificial imposition of the sky level between diameters of 5 and 6@xmath2 .",
    "evidence that the source is not extended much beyond a diameter of 5@xmath2 is provided by figure 3 which shows that , within the uncertainties , the enclosed flux within a 4@xmath2 diameter beam is the same as within the iras beam . the lack of a dominant compact component in the mid - infrared make this object very different from the other ulirgs in this sample .",
    "the radio emission from iras  17208 - 0014 is much more compact than the infrared emission .",

    "this core is clearly not dominant in the mid - infrared imaging .",
    "the near infrared nicmos imaging of this galaxy ( s99 ) suggests that the nucleus could be obscured at 2.2@xmath0 m , but the lack of detection of a strong compact core at 12.5@xmath0 m is quite peculiar , since the radio source is so compact .",

    "ugc 5101 , does the compact nucleus produce significantly less than half the total mid - infrared emission from the system .",
    "as noted previously , iras   17208@xmath210014 presents an interesting puzzle .",
    "there is no mid - infrared evidence for a compact nuclear source , but the radio data ( c91 , martin et al .",
    "1989 ) strongly suggest a power source with a size @xmath240.3@xmath2 . in the following discussion",
    ", we will adopt the morphology implied by the 12.5@xmath0 m image , but we note that extremely high 12.5@xmath0 m extinction could be leading to an erroneous interpretation of the nuclear structure in iras   17208@xmath210014 .    table 5 shows that the compact nuclear sources have linear sizes typically @xmath24200 pc in diameter . in arp 220 the diameter of the western source is 140 pc at 24.5@xmath0 m ( soifer et al .",
    "1999 ) , while in markarian 231 , the diameter of the 12.5@xmath0 m source is @xmath24100 pc .",
    "one of the goals of the observations reported here is to distinguish the ultimate source of the infrared luminosity in these systems by means of the spatial extent of the infrared emission .",
    "if the dust is heated by a bright compact object such as an agn , the dust emission will be compact , and the size of the infrared source will increase with increasing wavelength roughly as @xmath42 , since the dust temperature will decrease with radius as @xmath43 and the wavelength of maximum emission @xmath44 . if , on the other hand , the heating is due to many hot stars in a starburst region , then the dust emission will be distributed on the same scale as the young , luminous stars . since the dust heating is due to the proximity of the dust to the luminous young stars there will be little or no temperature gradient seen .",
    "spatially extended 10  @xmath0 m emission therefore implies starburst activity , while spatially compact 10  @xmath0 m emission could be due to either a compact starburst or an agn .    to quantify the compact mid - infrared emission we utilize the brightness temperatures derived from our observations and the color temperatures determined from the iras 25 and 60@xmath0 m observations of these objects .",
    "we assume that t@xmath45 measures the temperature of the grains heated by the luminosity source ; t@xmath46 should be @xmath14t@xmath45 if the optical depth @xmath47 . only in the limit of large optical depth",
    "should the brightness temperature approach the color temperature .",
    "based on the mirlin observations of arp 220 , soifer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that the dominant luminosity source , arp 220w , is optically thick with a brightness temperature at 25  @xmath0 m equal to the color temperature between 25 and 60  @xmath0 m .",
    "the observations reported here permit analogous constraints to be placed on some of the nuclear sources in other ulirgs in this sample .",
    "in markarian 231 , iras 05189@xmath212524 and iras 08572 + 3915 , the limits on the sizes of the central infrared sources are sufficiently small that it is worthwhile considering how these sizes constrain the far infrared sources .    the size limit on markarian 231 of 0.13@xmath2 at 12.5@xmath0 m places the most severe limits on models of the infrared emitting region .",
    "in this case the observed flux density and size limit lead to a lower limit on the brightness temperature of t@xmath48  141k at 12.5@xmath0 m . if the infrared emitting source has the same size at 17.9  @xmath0 m , 25  @xmath0 m and 60  @xmath0 m , the corresponding brightness temperatures are 124  k , 128  k and 241  k. the brightness temperatures at 12.5@xmath0 m , 17.9@xmath0 m and 25  @xmath0 m are consistent with each other and with a nearly optically thick source over this wavelength range , but the 60  @xmath0 m brightness temperature is much too large to be consistent with dust models with reasonable grain properties .",
    "this implies that the 60@xmath0 m source size is much larger than the 12.5@xmath0 m size .    the color temperature measured between 25 and 60",
    "@xmath0 m , determined from the iras measurements , is 85  k. the size of a blackbody of 85  k required to produce the observed 60@xmath0 m flux density is 0.4@xmath2 , significantly larger than the limit on the source size at 12.5@xmath0 m .",
    "the source size determined if t@xmath26  t@xmath46 represents a lower limit on the size of the 60@xmath0 m source . for example , if the size of the 60@xmath0 m source were equal to the @xmath61@xmath2 size found in co by downs and solomon ( 1998 ) , the 60@xmath0 m brightness temperature would be 53k , much less than that inferred by assuming all the 25 and 60 @xmath0 m emission is emerging from the same region .",
    "the size limits are based on the assumption of large optical depth ( @xmath491 ) ; smaller optical depth would imply an even larger source . since significant emission is seen at @xmath50 m , either @xmath511 or we are viewing a tilted optically thick disk , as suggested for arp 220 ( scoville et al . 1998 ,",
    "downs and solomon , 1998 , sakamoto et al . 1999 ,",
    "soifer et al . 1999 ) . in either case , the size constraints show that in markarian 231 the infrared source increases in size with increasing wavelength .",
    "this is consistent with the picture of an agn with luminosity of 3@xmath1510@xmath52 l@xmath53 heating the surrounding dust and producing a radial temperature gradient .    in this sample",
    "there are two additional ulirgs where significantly more than 50% of the mid - infrared luminosity emerges from a compact central source , iras  05189 - 2524 and iras  08572 + 3915 . in iras  05189 - 2524 , if the size of the 60@xmath0 m emitting source is the same as the limit on the 12.5@xmath0 m source measured here , t@xmath46(60@xmath0m)=101",

    "k is slightly less than t@xmath5483  k determined from the iras data at 25 and 60@xmath0 m . for both sources , using dust properties described by draine and lee ( 1984 ) the sizes calculated for silicate and graphite dust grains heated by central sources of the observed bolometric luminosity , and having dust temperatures equal to the observed color temperatures are larger by a factor of 1.5 to 3 than the observed sizes of these sources at 12.5@xmath0 m .",
    "this suggests that the sizes of these infrared sources also increase with increasing mid and far - infrared wavelength .",
    "high apparent surface brightnesses and a radial temperature gradient are natural consequences of centrally heated dust emission surrounding a high luminosity source , i.e. , an agn . in markarian 231",

    "the observed luminosities are adequate to quantitatively account for the inferred variation of dust temperature with radius if the dust is heated by a central source in these objects .",

    "these observations lead to apparent surface brightnesses of emergent luminosity of @xmath57/kpc@xmath58 . if , as seems likely , m82 is being viewed edge - on , then the mean surface brightness of this system , if viewed face on , is closer to 2@xmath59/kpc@xmath58 .",

    "the surface brightnesses observed in the ulirgs can be estimated if we assume that the size ( or limit ) of the region measured in the mid - infrared is representative of the infrared emitting region as a whole . with this assumption ,",
    "we have presented the surface brightnesses for the observed ulirgs in table 5 .",
    "we include two values of the surface brightness , a `` maximum '' which assumes that the fraction of the total infrared luminosity emerging from the compact core is the same as the fraction of the mid - infrared flux density emerging from the core , and a `` minimum '' that assumes that only the _ observed _ mid - infrared luminosity emerges from the compact core . in the case of markarian 231 , the former number is unphysically large ( section 5.2 ) . in the other systems ,",
    "the two values represent likely upper and very conservative lower limits on the apparent surface brightness of the infrared emission .    only in the case of iras  17208@xmath210014 , where the near and mid - infrared observations suggest",

    "other than this case , the inferred surface brightnesses are much greater than found globally in disk starburst systems .",
    "the highest apparent surface brightnesses in the ulirgs are found in the western nucleus of arp 220 , which is most likely powered by a nuclear starburst ( smith et al .",
    "1998b ) and the cores of markarian 231 and iras  05189@xmath212524 , which are probably powered by agn . in these cores the apparent surface brightness approaches or surpasses the surface brightness of clusters in starburst galaxies , while in the other systems ( excluding iras  17208@xmath210014 ) the surface brightness most probably exceeds @xmath63/kpc@xmath58 . in all these cases",
    "the surface brightness over regions of hundreds of parsecs across are comparable to the brightness found in @xmath610 pc sized clusters within starburst systems by meurer et al .    for the ulirgs that are powered by star formation , the large surface brightnesses and sizes suggest that the global starburst intensity regulating mechanism of meurer et al . (",
    "1997 ) does not apply .",
    "gravitational instability allows for higher gas densities and hence higher star - formation rates in the solid - body ( no shear ) rotation nuclear regions .",
    "since the nuclei of most ulirgs are mergers , far from equilibrium , the gas densities may be very high , leading to high star formation rates and correspondingly high surface brightnesses for short times .",

    "several studies ( e.g. , sanders et al . 1988 , scoville , yun and bryant 1997 , downes and solomon 1998 ) suggest that the nuclear disks are unstable in some ulirgs .",
