    "since the revolutionary developments in quantum field theory around the middle of the last century , feynman diagrams have been an essential tool for computing scattering amplitudes .",
    "as represented by the feynman expansion , amplitudes can be determined perturbatively by summing over all graphs with a fixed number of loops that connect the external states by appropriate vertices and propagators and integrating over all the internal loop - momenta . while intuitive and ultimately correct , the feynman expansion rapidly becomes intractable both because the number of diagrams grows rapidly with the number of external legs and loops , but also because individual diagrams in many theories depend on a great deal of purely theoretical data ( such as gauge redundancies ) that have no consequences for physical predictions .",
    "because of this , there has long been interest in finding formulations of perturbation theory without any explicit reference to unphysical data .",
    "this was the principal motivation behind the feynman tree theorem  @xcite , the essence of which can be be understood ( in a rather novel way ) from the well - known partial fraction identity : @xmath0.\\vspace{-5pt}\\label{partial_fraction_identity}\\hspace{-100pt}\\vspace{-0.pt}\\ ] ] when the factors @xmath1 are feynman propagators for an off - shell loop momentum @xmath2 , the terms @xmath3 become linear in @xmath2 and can therefore be interpreted as propagators involving an _ on - shell _ momentum @xmath2 . expanding every term in the feynman expansion in this way , it is tempting to view the coefficient of each @xmath4 as a lower - loop _ amplitude _ , evaluated in the forward - limit .",
    "this is precisely correct for theories ( such as those with supersymmetry ) whose amplitudes are finite in the forward - limit ; and this leads , for example , to the representation found in for one - loop amplitudes in supergravity , derived within the scattering equation formalism @xcite . but for most theories , however , scattering amplitudes diverge in the forward - limit , preventing any ( unqualified ) interpretation of the terms in this expansion as limits of lower - loop amplitudes .    in this letter , we present a new representation of amplitudes which avoids this obstruction , allowing one to write the coefficient of each off - shell propagator @xmath4 in the expansion above in terms of `` '' , which are well - defined in any theory in terms of gauge - invariant tree - amplitudes alone . in the following section",
    ", we derive this representation in detail for one - loop amplitudes and show how each term in this expansion can be integrated by ordinary means .",
    "we then describe how this approach generalizes to higher loops , illustrating the rich structure that emerges beyond two - loops .",
    "[ one_loop_section ] for the sake of concreteness and clarity , let us restrict our attention to one - loop amplitudes of theories with massless particles , so that feynman propagators for the loop momenta are of the form @xmath6 .",
    "both in order to generalize the partial fraction decomposition to cases with loop - dependent numerators , and to introduce ideas that will prove useful later on , let us derive equation ( [ partial_fraction_identity ] ) as an instance of cauchy s residue theorem .",
    "consider transforming @xmath7 where @xmath8 is orthogonal to the external momenta to lie along the extra dimensions .",
    "] satisfying @xmath9 so that @xmath10 , and @xmath11 for propagators involving @xmath2 . transforming a feynman diagram this way and dividing by @xmath12 results in @xmath13 after this deformation , the statement that the sum of all the residues in @xmath12 vanishes trivially reduces to equation ( [ partial_fraction_identity ] ) as a special case .    using this generalization of the partial fraction expansion to decompose every integral of the feynman expansion , it is easy to see that every term has the form ( up to a shift in @xmath2 by external momenta ) , @xmath14 , \\vspace{-5pt}\\label{form_of_linearized_ints}\\hspace{-100pt}\\vspace{-0.pt}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 accounts for both the numerators of the diagrams and any loop - independent propagators",
    ". let @xmath16 denote the factors in the square brackets above .",
    "although forward - limit divergences prevent us from interpreting @xmath16 in terms of an entire tree - amplitude in general , it turns out that we can construct @xmath16 in terms of tree - level objects _ up to terms that vanish upon integration_. this becomes possible after one further partial - fraction - like expansion  this time , in the scale of @xmath2 .",
    "concretely , consider the residue theorem resulting from : @xmath17 clearly , @xmath16 is recovered as the residue of @xmath18 at @xmath19 ; and by cauchy s theorem , this is equal to ( minus ) the sum of all other residues .",
    "these residues are associated with three types of poles : at zero , at infinity , and at finite locations ( @xmath20 ) . by inspection of equation ( [ form_of_linearized_ints ] ) , residues at @xmath21 correspond to integrals of the form , @xmath22 where the product runs over only those factors for which @xmath23 , and @xmath24 denotes all other factors at @xmath21 .",
    "integrals of this form must vanish upon integration in any number of dimensions @xmath25 because the denominator is homogeneous in @xmath2 and hence scale - free .",
    "similarly , the laurent expansion of @xmath18 at @xmath26 can involve only terms homogeneous in @xmath2 , which hence vanish upon integration .",
    "notice that these residues precisely correspond to the terms poorly defined in the forward - limit .",
    "therefore , we can replace @xmath16 by the sum of residues of @xmath18 at importantly , all such residues can be interpreted as involving _ two _ additional on - shell particles , with specific momenta determined by the successive residues .",
    "it is not hard to see that expanding every term in the feynman expansion in this way , the coefficient of each pair of propagators becomes a product of complete tree - amplitudes evaluated for particular on - shell , internal momenta ( and summing over states ) : @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and , and where @xmath31 denotes the sum of momenta over a partition of external legs .",
    "we refer to functions of the form of ( [ one_loop_q_cut ] ) as , which we can represent graphically as follows : @xmath32{one_loop_q_cut}}}\\vspace{-7.5pt}\\label{one_loop_q_cut_figure}\\hspace{-100pt}\\vspace{-0.pt}\\ ] ] notice that the shifted propagator , corresponding to the factor @xmath33 in equation ( [ one_loop_q_cut ] ) , is indicated by a dashed line in the figure above to distinguish it from the unshifted , off - shell propagator @xmath34 .",
    "we claim that the sum over all ( with ) reproduces any one - loop amplitude .",
    "notice that the integrand of a is similar to a cutkosky unitarity cut  @xcite .",
    "the principal novelty involved in the is that the amplitudes involved are evaluated with _ shifted _",
    "( on - shell ) values of @xmath35 , multiplied by unusual propagators .",
    "[ loop_contour_section ] at a fundamental level , the causal structure of scattering amplitudes is encoded in the feynman @xmath36-prescription , critical to the precise definition of the loop integration contour .",
    "it will be useful here to observe that every feynman propagator can be assigned its own @xmath37 , transforming @xmath38 ; so long as each @xmath39 is real and positive , the physical contour will be unambiguous ( and independent of the @xmath39 s ) .",
    "since do not involve products of feynman propagators , it is not immediately clear how to assign @xmath36 s to the linear poles appearing in their definition .",
    "however , if we had started with a single feynman integral with specific @xmath37 s for each propagator , then the partial fraction expansion would result in terms of the form @xmath40 , with contours prescribed by shifts involving @xmath41 , the signs of which will be fully determined by the ( arbitrary ) ordering of the original @xmath37 s .",
    "this always provides a precise contour of integration for the resulting expressions that is guaranteed to match the original expression .",
    "the problem is in going in the other direction : to assign an unambiguous prescription for the @xmath37 s associated with the linear - factors in @xmath2 of each integral.s of all propagators can be identified and conventionally ordered according to the ordering of the external legs , an unambiguous convention for the signs of the @xmath37 s for any linear factor can be easily assigned . ]",
    "( we should mention that the contour we describe here requires that on - shell tree amplitudes are represented in a way that involves only local poles .",
    "representations of trees generated by the bcfw recursion relations  @xcite , for example , involve spurious , complex poles in individual terms . finding a contour prescription for such terms is an important and interesting open problem . )",
    "it turns out that a maximally democratic contour prescription will always work  meaning , that it is guaranteed to match the feynman contour .",
    "specifically , we may simply average over the possible relative orderings of the @xmath39 s for the initial propagators .",
    "it will help to clarify this contour prescription with a few examples .",
    "consider a single propagator linear in @xmath2 , denoted @xmath42 .",
    "its @xmath37 can be arbitrary , so we are instructed average over the @xmath43 possible choices for the sign of its @xmath36-prescription ; thus , the contour prescription becomes the principle value via the replacement : @xmath44}.\\vspace{-5pt}\\label{single_factor_pv}\\hspace{-100pt}\\vspace{-0.pt}\\ ] ] ( recall the possible contour prescriptions  defined by , @xmath45}\\mp i \\pi \\delta(x),\\vspace{-5pt}\\hspace{-100pt}\\vspace{-0.pt}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the ( non - holomorphic ) dirac @xmath47-function . )    for three propagators ( the case involving two linear propagators after the partial fraction decomposition ) , the result is rather less trivial : the @xmath48 relative orderings for the @xmath37 s of the three propagators result in a more interesting distribution of differences .",
    "it is a simple exercise to see that the resulting contour prescription for the any pair of differences should be : @xmath49}{\\mathcal{p}\\big[\\frac{1}{y}\\big]}-\\frac{1}{3}\\pi^2\\delta(x)\\delta(y).\\vspace{-5pt}\\hspace{-100pt}\\vspace{-0.pt}\\ ] ] for four propagators ( three linear ones ) , the prescription is quite similar : @xmath50 should be replaced by , @xmath51}{\\mathcal{p}\\big[\\frac{1}{y}\\big]}{\\mathcal{p}\\big[\\frac{1}{z}\\big]}\\\\[0pt]\\hspace{-20pt}&-\\frac{1}{3}\\pi^2\\big(\\delta(x)\\delta(y){\\mathcal{p}\\big[\\frac{1}{z}\\big]}{\\raisebox{0.75pt}{\\scalebox{0.75}{$\\,+\\,$}}}\\delta(y)\\delta(z){\\mathcal{p}\\big[\\frac{1}{x}\\big]}{\\raisebox{0.75pt}{\\scalebox{0.75}{$\\,+\\,$}}}\\delta(z)\\delta(x){\\mathcal{p}\\big[\\frac{1}{y}\\big]}\\big).\\hspace{-30pt}\\\\[-20pt]~\\hspace{-20pt}\\label{three_factor_pv}\\end{split}\\vspace{-0.0pt}\\ ] ] and for five or more , there will be terms involving four @xmath47-functions for each quadruplet ( times @xmath52 ) , etc .",
