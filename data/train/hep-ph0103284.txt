    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is now widely regarded to be the most plausible extension of the sm ; among other things , it stabilizes the gauge hierarchy @xcite and allows for the grand unification of all known gauge interactions @xcite . of course",

    "this introduces a large number of unknown parameters , many of which can be complex @xcite .",
    "cp  violating phases associated with sfermions of the first and , to a lesser extent , second generation are severely constrained by bounds on the electric dipole moments of the electron , neutron and muon .",
    "however , it has recently been realized @xcite that cancellations between different diagrams allow some combinations of these phases to be quite large . even in models with universal boundary conditions for soft breaking masses at some very high energy scale , the relative phase between the supersymmetric higgsino mass parameter @xmath9 and the universal trilinear soft breaking parameter @xmath10 can be @xmath11 @xcite . if universality is not assumed , the phases of third generation trilinear soft breaking parameters are essentially unconstrained .",
    "in fact , some of these phases might be large @xcite so as to provide non  sm sources of cp violation required for a dynamical generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "recently it has been realized that the explicit cp violation in the mass matrices of the third generation squarks with such possibly large cp phases is large , the third  generation cp phases are constrained by the electric dipole moments of the electron and neutron because in this case their contributions at the two  loop level could be sizable @xcite .",

    "this induced cp violation in the mssm higgs sector can affect the phenomenology of the higgs bosons at present and future colliders @xcite .",

    "these couplings play an important role in the calculation of loop - induced couplings of higgs bosons to photons and gluons as well as in the production of third generation sfermions at @xmath12 colliders @xcite .    in the past few years",
    "a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to investigations of the physics potential of high energy @xmath13 colliders @xcite as a plausible future experimental program .",
    "since muons emit far less synchrotron radiation than electrons do , a muon collider might be significantly smaller and cheaper than an @xmath14 collider operating at the same center  of  mass energy @xmath15 .",
    "the main physics advantage of muon colliders compared to the conventional @xmath16 and hadron colliders is that the larger yukawa coupling of muons in many cases admits copious production of higgs bosons as @xmath17channel resonances , allowing to perform precision measurements of their properties @xcite . in particular",
    ", they can allow us to search for cp  violation in the couplings of higgs bosons to not only heavy sm fermions but also to third generation sfermions , which have large yukawa couplings .",
    "it is difficult to probe these cp phases through processes controlled by gauge interactions , where large cp  odd asymmetries can emerge only if some sfermion mass eigenstates are closely degenerate , with mass splitting of the order of the decay width , in which case flavor or chirality oscillations can occur @xcite . on the other hand , in the mssm cp ",
    "violating phases can appear at tree level in the couplings of a single sfermion species to neutral higgs bosons .",

    "furthermore , unlike for @xmath20 and @xmath21 production the charge of a produced @xmath18 is usually readily measurable ; this is necessary for the construction of most cp  odd asymmetries .",
    "finally , in most models sleptons are significantly lighter than squarks , making it easier to study them at lepton colliders .    in the present work",
    "we extend the previous work @xcite significantly in order to discuss in more detail signals for cp violation in the production processes @xmath22 where @xmath1 label the two @xmath2 slepton mass eigenstates .",
    "we work in the framework of the mssm with explicit cp violation . more specifically , we present a general formalism and a detailed analysis of the effects of the cp  violating higgs boson mixing , and of the cp phases in the tau slepton mass matrix , on the polarized cross section for tau ",
    "slepton pair production .",
    "we consider both longitudinal and transverse polarization of the initial muon and anti ",
    "muon beams .",
    "a detailed procedure is suggested for measuring cp violation directly in the tau slepton system , under the assumption that the neutral higgs mixing angles are determined through the on  shell production of the neutral higgs bosons as demonstrated in ref .",

    "this is why we focus on the production of tau slepton pairs .",
    "even here the requirement that the heavy higgs boson masses are larger than the sum of the tau slepton masses imposes a nontrivial constraint on the accessible parameter space .",
    "moreover , in the absence of a detailed monte carlo study it is not clear how well the production plane can be determined experimentally . in the following",
    "we therefore consider the cases without and with direct reconstruction of the production plane separately .    before turning to these asymmetries",
    "we briefly discuss the behavior of the total @xmath390 and @xmath391 cross sections .",

    "we see that the @xmath271 pair production cross section is sizable ( @xmath393 fb ) even away from the higgs poles .",
    "since here the dominant contributions come from gauge boson exchange , there is almost no sensitivity to the cp  violating phase @xmath381 , as discussed earlier .",
    "on the other hand , the higgs exchange contribution to the total cross section does depend significantly on this phase .",
    "not only the maximal value of this cross section , but also the energy where this maximum is reached depends on the cp  violating phases .",
    "this follows from the observation that in the absence of cp  violation a cp  odd higgs boson can not couple to an identical @xmath125 pair ; however , once cp is violated , both heavy higgs bosons contribute .",
    "in fact , for @xmath394 and @xmath389 , higgs boson exchange clearly dominates the total @xmath271 pair production cross section .",
    "the dominance of the higgs boson exchange contributions near the poles is even more pronounced in the @xmath395 channel . and",
    "@xmath396 production is negligible , as shown in sec .",
    "our choice ( [ eq : stau parameter set ] ) implies @xmath397 , which maximizes the @xmath398 coupling ( [ eq : qz ] ) .",
    "nevertheless the gauge boson exchange contributions are suppressed compared to the case of @xmath271 pair production by the absence of photon exchange contributions and by the smaller available phase space ( @xmath399 , as compared to @xmath400 ) .",
    "note that the higgs boson exchange contribution only scales like @xmath198 , and is hence much less phase space suppressed .",
    "moreover , even in the absence of cp  violation both higgs bosons can contribute to @xmath395 production .",
    "nevertheless a strong dependence on the value of @xmath381 can be seen also in this case .",
    "note that the @xmath395 production cross section typically changes by more than a factor of 10 over the shown range of energies , as compared to a variation by a factor 2 to 5 in case of @xmath271 pair production .",
    "the energy dependence of the total cross section is therefore especially important for the understanding of the @xmath15 dependence of asymmetries in the @xmath395 channel , which includes all rate asymmetries .",
    "note also that the peak cross section , which falls in the range of @xmath401 to @xmath402 fb , is sizable also in this channel , when compared to the anticipated luminosity of @xmath403 fb@xmath404 per year @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that in the absence of cp  violation in the higgs sector the total cross sections depend are even functions of the phase @xmath381 .",
    "this explains why the curves for @xmath405 coincide with those for @xmath406 in figs .",
    "[ fig : tot](a ) and ( c ) .",
    "however , this degeneracy is lifted if @xmath407 .",
    "[ fig : tot ]      if the production plane is not reconstructed , all the sv correlations are averaged away when integrating over the azimuthal angle @xmath199 , but the polarization and rate asymmetries corresponding to the coefficients @xmath408 survive .",
