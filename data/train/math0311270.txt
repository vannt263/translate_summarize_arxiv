    "forman introduced discrete morse theory in [ fo ] as a tool for studying the homotopy type and homology groups of finite cw - complexes . in joint work with babson",
    ", we introduced a way of constructing a `` lexicographic discrete morse function '' for the order complex of any finite poset with @xmath0 and @xmath1 from any lexicographic order on its saturated chains [ bh ] .",
    "lexicographic discrete morse functions have a relatively small number of critical cells : when one builds the complex by sequentially attaching facets in lexicographic order , each facet introduces at most one new critical cell ; facets leaving the homotopy type unchanged do not contribute any new critical cells .",
    "the most natural of poset edge - labellings and chain - labellings seem to yield lexicographic discrete morse functions in which one may easily give a systematic description of critical cells , but typically not minimal morse functions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide tools for `` optimizing '' discrete morse functions by cancelling pairs of critical cells , both in general and specifically in lexicographic discrete morse functions .",
    "we do not address the very interesting question of how to turn an arbitrary discrete morse function into an optimal one , but rather provide tools that seem to work well at turning very natural discrete morse functions on complexes that arise in practice , especially on poset order complexes , into ones with smaller morse numbers ( and often into optimal morse functions ) . in examples , we have used these tools to establish homotopy type and connectivity results and for proving that posets are cohen - macaulay , without needing to find a shelling .",
    "using our machinery typically seems to require somewhat lengthy proofs , but this is because there are several things one needs to check , each of which is often straightforward .",
    "our main results as far as machinery for constructing discrete morse functions are : ( 1 ) that a pair of critical cells @xmath2 in a lexicographic discrete morse function may be cancelled whenever there is a certain type of gradient path from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , by virtue of a correspondence between gradient paths and certain types of reduced expressions for permutations , and ( 2 ) a criterion for reversing several gradient paths , each of which is individually reversible , to cancel several pairs of critical cells . along the way",
    ", we introduce the notion of a least - content - increasing labelling , a class of labellings for which critical cell cancellation seems to be particularly manageable .",
    "we also provide an elementary new proof of the homotopy type for intervals in weak order of the symmetric group , a new characterization for lexicographically first reduced expressions for permutations which was needed to prove ( 1 ) , and we show that discrete morse functions interact well with filtrations .",
    "finally , we apply the above results to prove that two posets are homotopically cohen - macaulay : the poset @xmath5 of collections of independent lines in a finite vector space , and the poset @xmath6 of partitions of @xmath7 into cycles .",
    "the former is the face poset of a matroid complex , and so is well - known to be shellable ( see [ bj2 ] ) , but is included to illustrate on a familiar example a strategy for constructing and optimizing a discrete morse function that has also worked on much more complex examples .",
    "the latter poset was recently defined by remmel as a new partial order on permutations in @xmath8 .",
    "see [ hw ] for a much harder application of our machinery to monoid posets .",
    "[ hw ] provides a connectivity lower bound for finite intervals in the partial order by divisibility on the monomials in the coordinate ring for a toric variety , in terms of the degree of any grbner basis for its toric ideal of syzygies ; this yields information about tor groups , via a result of [ ls ] ( see also [ prs ] , [ hrw ] ) .",
    "the monoid posets in [ hw ] and a @xmath9-analogue of the partition lattice ( defined by shareshian ) both break into subposets that are much like apartments ; these `` apartments '' have labellings called least - content - increasing labellings ( see section  [ lex ] ) that are particularly amenable to critical cell cancellation . an observation from [ hw ]",
    "allows cancellation of critical cells within these subposets , using features of least - content - increasing labellings that we will develop in section  [ lex ] , despite the fact that we do know how to constuct such a well - behaved labelling for these posets globally .",
    "thus , properties of least - content - increasing labellings may be useful for critical cell cancellation even in posets that do not possess such a nice global labelling .",
    "we begin with a review of discrete morse theory , but first we quickly recall terminology related to reduced expressions for permutations , since these will play a prominent role as a way of describing and analyzing gradient paths in lexicographic discrete morse functions . recall that any permutation may be expressed as a product of adjacent transpositions .",
    "denote by @xmath10 the adjacent transposition swapping @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "an * inversion * in a permutation @xmath13 is a pair @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "a * reduced expression * for @xmath13 is a product of adjacent transpositions of smallest possible length , namely one in which each of the adjacent tranpositions increases the number of inversions by exactly one .",
    "any two reduced expressions for the same permutation are connected by a series of braid relations , i.e. relations of the form @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "see [ hum ] or [ ga ] for more about reduced expressions for permutations . in our setting , permutations in @xmath8 will act by permuting the positions of labels in a label sequence of lenth @xmath19 , so @xmath10 will swap the @xmath11-th and @xmath20-st labels .",
    "forman introduced discrete morse theory for cw complexes in [ fo ] , then chari provided a combinatorial reformulation for regular cell complexes in [ ch ] .",
    "most discrete morse functions in the literature have used this combinatorial reformulation , in which one constructs an `` acyclic matching '' on the face poset of the complex .",
    "let @xmath21 denote a cell of dimension @xmath22 .",
    "forman defines a function @xmath23 which assigns real values to the cells in a regular cell complex to be a * discrete morse function * if for each cell @xmath21 , the sets @xmath24 and @xmath25 each have cardinality at most one .",
    "requiring this for every @xmath4 implies that for each @xmath4 , at most one of these cardinalities is nonzero .",
    "when both cardinalities are 0 , @xmath4 is called a * critical cell*.    figure  [ height ] gives an example of a discrete morse function on a 1-sphere resulting from a height function .",
    "critical cells record changes in topological structure as a complex is built by sequentially inserting cells in the order specified by the morse function ; the non - critical cells may be eliminated by a series of elementary collapses without changing the homotopy type or homology groups .",
    "the non - critical cells in a discrete morse function always come in pairs @xmath26 which prevent each other from being critical by satisfying @xmath27 .",
    "the elementary collapses eliminate these pairs of non - critical cells , using the fact that @xmath4 is a free face of @xmath3 in a certain partial complex ( see section  [ gradpath ] for more detail ) . any discrete morse function on a regular cell complex",
    "gives rise to a matching on its face poset , by pairing up non - critical cells that prevent each other from being critical and leaving critical cells unmatched .",
    "recall that the * face poset * of a regular cell complex is the partial order on cells using comparability relations @xmath28 for each @xmath4 in the boundary of the closure of @xmath3 .",
    "( 250,100)(-60,15 )    a matching on ( the hasse diagram of ) the face poset of a regular cell complex is * acyclic * if the directed graph obtained by directing matching edges upward and all other edges downward has no directed cycles . recall that the hasse diagram of a poset is the graph whose vertices are poset elements and whose edges are covering relations , i.e. comparabilities @xmath29 such that there is no intermediate element @xmath30 satisfying @xmath31 .",
    "observe that the face poset matching resulting from a discrete morse function is always acyclic , because the edges are oriented in the direction in which @xmath23 decreases .",
    "conversely , many different ( but in some sense equivalent ) discrete morse functions may be constructed from any face poset acyclic matching .    given an acyclic matching on a facet poset with @xmath19 elements , the corresponding discrete morse functions are the points in a cone in @xmath32 bounded by hyperplanes @xmath33 coming from pairs of comparable poset elements @xmath34 .",
    "the acyclic matching determines which side of each hyperplane contributes to the cone , and its acyclicity ensures that the cone is non - empty .",

    ", we include the empty set in our face poset , so as to get a reduced version of discrete morse theory , and we let @xmath39 denote the reduced morse numbers and reduced betti numbers , respectively .",
    "forman showed in [ fo ] that @xmath36 collapses onto a cw - complex @xmath40 which has @xmath35 cells of dimension @xmath11 for each @xmath11 , such that @xmath40 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath36 .",
    "the existence of such a complex @xmath40 implies that the following results from traditional morse theory , the first two of which are called the morse inequalities , carry over to discrete morse theory .",

    "another consequence of the homotopy equivalence of @xmath36 to such a complex @xmath40 is that any @xmath36 with @xmath50 for @xmath51 is @xmath52-connected .",

    "letting @xmath55 turns this into a reduced discrete morse function with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the morse numbers are larger than the betti numbers because there is a critical cell of dimension 0 that is labelled 4 which locally looks as though it is creating a new connected component as the complex is built from bottom to top and there is a critical cell of dimension one that is labelled 5 which locally appears to be closing off a 1-cycle , but these two critical cells actually cancel each other s effect .",
    "recall that the * order complex * of a finite poset @xmath58 with @xmath0 and @xmath1 is the simplicial complex , denoted @xmath59 , whose @xmath11-faces are chains @xmath60 of comparable poset elements . since @xmath61 ( cf .",

    "a poset is * homotopically cohen - macaulay * if each interval is homotopy - equivalent to a wedge of spheres of top dimension .",

    ", forman also requires @xmath64 whenever @xmath4 is a non - regular face of @xmath3 .",
    "it is not clear a priori how to define a face poset for non - regular cw - complexes : for instance , one face may be incident to another in multiple ways ( e.g. the real projective plane , viewed as a cw - complex with one 0-cell , one 1-cell and one 2-cell ) , or a cell may differ in dimension from top - dimensional cells in its boundary by more than one ( e.g. a 2-sphere , viewed as a cw - complex with a 0-cell and a 2-cell ) .",
    "in section  [ gradpath ] , we use gradient paths in @xmath36 to construct a multi - graph version of a face poset , denoted @xmath65 , for the ( potentially non - regular ) cw - complex @xmath40 , and we provide an analogue to chari s acyclic matching construction .",
    "forman shows that whenever a discrete morse function has two critical cells @xmath66 and @xmath67 such that there is a unique gradient path from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( i.e. a path upon which @xmath23 decreases at each step ) , then one may obtain a new acyclic matching in which @xmath4 and @xmath3 are no longer critical by reversing this gradient path , since doing so can not create any directed cycles .",
    "such a reversal for instance straightens the 1-sphere in figure  [ height ] into one in which two of the critical cells have been eliminated . on the other hand ,",

    "our focus is on homotopy type , but is there also a notion of rank - selected lexicographic discrete morse functions for graded posets which may be used ( at least for sufficiently nice posets ) to compute flag @xmath70-vectors ?",
    "perhaps the poset of section  [ pd1nq ] would be a good first example to keep in mind while developing such a notion .",
    "recall from [ fo ] that if there is a unique gradient path from a critical cell @xmath67 to a critical cell @xmath71 , then this path may be reversed to obtain a new discrete morse function in which the two cells are no longer critical ( similar to the situation with traditional morse functions ) .",
    "we say that these critical cells * cancel*. reversing the path can not create any directed cycles , by virtue of the uniqueness of the gradient path from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . to see that we still get a matching , notice that the vertices along the path were all matched with other vertices along the path , and we have just redistributed how these are paired so as to incorporate the endpoints .",

    "if @xmath76 is the only cell in the boundary of @xmath77 that has not yet been inserted , then we may attach the cells @xmath78 to the complex both at once without changing the homotopy type .",

    "each such gradient path gives a distinct way in which @xmath4 is incident to @xmath3 in @xmath40 , implying that @xmath4 is not a regular face of @xmath3 unless there is a unique gradient path from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",

    "our main interest in theorem  [ lex - last ] below is that it will help us in section 6 to show that certain gradient paths in lexicographic discrete morse functions are unique and hence reversible .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ lex - last ] is quite similar to a proof that any two reduced expressions for a fixed permutation are connected by a series of coxeter relations .",
    "see [ ga ] for one such proof .",
    "recall that a reduced expression for a permutation @xmath13 is the * lexicographically first reduced expression * for @xmath13 if its reduced word precedes all other reduced words for reduced expressions for @xmath13 in lexicographic order , i.e. when we say @xmath238 if @xmath239 has a smaller letter at the first place that the two words differ .",

    "we first show that every permutation has at least one reduced expression meeting the requirements , then prove its uniqueness . to construct such a reduced expression , we view a reduced expression as a sorting procedure which uses adjacent transpositions to sort @xmath19 numbers that are initially out of order .",
    "first shift the number @xmath19 upward to the last position , then shift @xmath242 to the second to last position , and continue in this fashion , proceeding from the largest value to the smallest one .",
    "it is easy to check that this reduced expression meets the requirements .",
    "alternatively , note that the reversal of the lexicographically first reduced expression for the inverse permutation must take this form .    to prove uniqueness ,",
    "we first show that any allowable reduced expression @xmath243 has exactly one copy of @xmath244 for @xmath245 the maximal index appearing in @xmath243 .",

    "hence , @xmath243 has exactly one copy of @xmath244 .",
    "a similar argument shows there is at most one copy of @xmath246 on each side of the @xmath244 , and for each @xmath249 , @xmath243 has at most one copy of @xmath250 between each pair of consecutive copies of @xmath251 , at most @xmath250 before the first @xmath251 and at most one after the final @xmath251 . whenever an @xmath250 appears between two copies of @xmath251 ( or before the first copy of @xmath251 ) , the @xmath250 must immediately precede @xmath251 , since consecutive reflections @xmath252 for @xmath253 are not allowed .",

    "there is probably an easier proof for theorem  [ red_exp ] using inversions in permutations , but our hope is that our proof has the potential to be generalized to deal with nonsaturated chain segments , at least in the special case of least - content - labellings , as defined shortly .",

    "recall that a saturated chain contributes a critical cell to the order complex if and only if its interval system covers all ranks , so we will some also characterize which saturated chains contribute critical cells .",
    "there are choices for how to list the elements of a cycle , resulting from our ability to cyclically shift elements of the cycle ; by convention , we list cycle elements in the order they will eventually appear in a coatom of the saturated chain being considered .",
    "let @xmath393 be a saturated chain @xmath473 with increasing labels from @xmath395 to @xmath1 .",
    "a * top interval * in @xmath393 is an interval @xmath396 such that :    1 .",
    "there is a coatom above @xmath395 that is smaller than @xmath474 2 .",
    "@xmath474 is the smallest coatom above @xmath475    a saturated chain @xmath393 has exactly the following types of minimal skipped intervals :    1 .",

    "top intervals    the fact that the labelling is least - content - increasing implies that every descent gives a minimal skipped interval of height one , and that all other minimal skipped intervals come from delinquent chains .",
    "however , our labelling restricted to any interval @xmath172 for @xmath476 is essentially the standard el - labelling for the partition lattice , so delinquent chains are only possible on intervals @xmath396 , and then must take the form above .",
    "thus , any saturated chain contributing a critical cell must have descending labels immediately followed by a top interval .      similarly to in @xmath5 , we will use non - essential sets to collect critical cells into boolean algebras .",
    "it will be desirable for the non - essential set of a saturated chain to depend only on its coatom permutation @xmath4 ( specifically on the inversions in @xmath4 ) and on the following tree structure associated to saturated chains .    a covering relation merging cycles @xmath477 gives rise to a * merge step * @xmath478 , where @xmath479 and @xmath480 .",
    "we associate a labelled tree with 1 as its root to a saturated chain by choosing the edges @xmath478 coming from merge steps in the saturated chain .",
    "notice that labels are decreasing along tree paths to the root , and there are @xmath462 such trees .",
    "the non - essential set of a saturated chain will be a certain subset of its merge steps .",
    "it will develop that these two pieces of data associated to a saturated chain , namely its co - atom and tree structure , will remain constant on certain boolean algebras of critical cells , ensuring that all elements of such a boolean algebra have the same non - essential set . to decide which merge steps belong to the non - essential set",
    ", we will need a notion of forced and unforced inversions in the co - atom permutation , the non - essential set of a saturated chain will consist of those merge steps which shuffle two cycles in the lexicographically smallest possible way .",
    "a merge step @xmath481 in a saturated chain with co - atom @xmath4 is said to have an * unforced * inversion if @xmath4 has an inversion @xmath14 with @xmath232 belonging to the two distinct cycles , @xmath477 , respectively , to be merged by @xmath481 , but @xmath261 has no inversions @xmath482 with @xmath227 .",
    "any other inversions between elements of @xmath477 are said to be * forced*.    the following lemma will help us to define non - essential sets as consisting of merge steps with no unforced inversions .",
    "[ forced - describe ] an interval @xmath396 in a saturated chain @xmath393 is a top interval if and only if it consists of merge steps @xmath483 with @xmath484 such that @xmath485 has at least one unforced inversion , but all subsequent merge steps @xmath486 have only forced inversions .",
    "let @xmath487 and @xmath488 be two permutation cycles , cyclically shifted to have their smallest elements listed first . now view the sequences @xmath489 and @xmath490 as two tapes to be read from left to right . to merge the sequences in the lexicographically smallest possible way",
    ", we proceed as follows :    1 .",
    "compare the current positions on the @xmath491 and @xmath492 tapes at each step .",
    "2 .   choose the smaller of the two values currently being viewed .",
    "3 .   append this number to the shuffled sequence being constructed .",
    "4 .   move forward one position on the tape from which we chose a number .    from this viewpoint ,",
    "it is clear that we can not add @xmath493 to the merged sequence before putting @xmath494 into the merged sequence unless there is some @xmath495 appearing earlier than @xmath494 on the @xmath491-tape , since we will not choose @xmath496 until the @xmath491-tape is at a value @xmath497 that is larger than @xmath496 .",
    "thus , for @xmath491 and @xmath492 to be merged in the lexicographically smallest possible way , all inversions between @xmath491 and @xmath492 must be forced inversions .    in the other direction ,",
    "if @xmath491 and @xmath492 are merged in a way that is not lexicographically smallest possible , consider the first place where the merged sequence differs from the lexicographically smallest choice .",
    "that is , consider the first step where we compare an element @xmath494 on the @xmath491 tape to an element @xmath496 on the @xmath492 tape and choose the larger of the two",
    ". without loss of generality , say @xmath498 .",
    "for this to be the first deviation from the lexicographically smallest choice , we are assured that there are no @xmath499 inversions on the @xmath491 tape for @xmath500 , because once such a @xmath501 is reached on the tape , we are assured that one tape or the other will have some @xmath502 as its current value until either we reach the end of one tape or the other , or we deviate from the lexicographically smallest choice of how to merge the two tapes .",
    "thus , we can not get to the state of having @xmath503 , which are both smaller than @xmath501 , as the current states of the two tapes , without deviating from the lexicographically smallest merged sequence before this , a contradiction .",
    "we have already associated a tree structure @xmath504 to each saturated chain @xmath393 . to define the non - essential set of @xmath393",
    ", we will also need a set partition on @xmath505 $ ] .",
    "we obtain this partition , denoted @xmath506 , from @xmath504 by deleting all tree edges of the form @xmath507 , then taking the graph components as the partition blocks .",
    "the * non - essential set * of @xmath393 consists of those tree edges @xmath507 such that the component of the partition @xmath508 containing @xmath11 does not have any unforced inversions with other components of @xmath508 .",
    "[ pres - tree ] each merge step @xmath509 may appear either in the top interval or in a unique position below the top interval which causes the labels below the top interval to be decreasing . shifting the merge step @xmath507 from one of these two positions to the other does not change tree structure .",
    "the first assertion follows from lemma  [ forced - describe ] . to see that tree structure",
    "is preserved , the point is to show that the block minimums are preserved , since the tree edge connect block minimums at merge steps .",
    "shifting @xmath507 upward to within the top interval or downward to the decreasing segment of labels can only change block minimums for blocks whose minimum element is @xmath11 .",
    "however , any merge steps @xmath14 for @xmath510 must occur below the lower of the two positions where @xmath507 may appear .",
    "[ lower - cancel ] let @xmath393 be a saturated chain which contributes a critical cell . then the labels in the interior of the top - interval of @xmath393 all belong to @xmath415 . in addition , any subset of @xmath415 may appear in the interior of the top interval .",
    "this follows immediately from proposition  [ pres - tree ] .",
    "[ bool - pm ] critical cells are arranged into boolean algebras @xmath447 in @xmath65 , based on their non - essential sets , with @xmath19 being the size of the non - essential set .",
    "this is immediate from lemma  [ near - el ] of the previous section .",
    "corollaries  [ lower - cancel ] and  [ bool - pm ] will allow us to collect all critical cells that are not top - dimensional , along with some top - dimensional ones , into boolean algebras @xmath447 with @xmath448 , since all non - top - dimensional critical cells have nonempty non - essential set .",
    "theorem  [ acyclic ] tells us that any acyclic matching on @xmath65 will give a collection of pairs of critical cells that may be cancelled simultaneously .",
    "notice that the standard complete matching on each boolean algebra @xmath447 for @xmath448 is clearly acyclic .",
    "next we show that the union of complete acyclic matchings on boolean algebras @xmath447 in @xmath65 for @xmath448 is itself an acyclic matching on @xmath65 , by showing directed cycles can not involve multiple boolean algebras . once again , this is done by finding a suitable partial order on boolean algebras , by examining what makes the morse function decrease .",
    "there are no directed cycles involving multiple boolean algebras .    similarly to with @xmath5 , we partially order boolean algebras of critical cells and show that gradient paths may only proceed from later boolean algebras to strictly earlier ones in this partial order .",
    "any gradient path from one boolean algebra to another one must either alter the coatom in a way that makes it smaller in lexicographic order or must alter the tree structure by turning a pair of edges @xmath511 into the pair of edges @xmath226 .",
    "thus , we partially order coatoms lexicographically and order tree structures by making covering relations @xmath512 .",
    "upward steps are impossible in both partial orders , so we can never return to the original boolean algebra .",
    "thus , we get acyclicity of the entire matching from the fact that the matching on each individual boolean algebra is acyclic .",
    "@xmath6 is a homotopically cohen - macaulay poset .",
    "the optimized discrete morse function has only top - dimensional critical cells , ensuring the interval @xmath449 is homotopy - equivalent to a wedge of spheres of top dimension .",
    "the proof extends to arbitrary intervals as follows .",

    "our discrete morse function easily generalizes to intervals @xmath396 by excluding from the non - essential set of a saturated chain restricted to @xmath396 any labels appearing below @xmath395 .",
