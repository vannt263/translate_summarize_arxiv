    "in recent years an increasing number of theoretical and experimental studies in condensed matter physics have focused on the description and understanding of quasi one and two dimensional strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "several fascinating properties of these materials are due to the competition between different phases with long - range order .",
    "high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates is one of the most famous examples which is not yet understood in a satisfactory way .",
    "realistic models that are used in this context consist of a kinetic part which accounts for the electron motion and an interaction part which is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the simplest model that can be constructed under these assumptions is the tight binding hubbard model .",
    "it consists of a kinetic energy part , where the electrons can only hop between nearest neighbor sites and the coulomb interaction @xmath1 which acts only locally on each site .",
    "although this model was used with great success for the description of a wide class of materials , there are interesting physical questions which require an extension .",
    "the inclusion of the nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction , for example , is necessary for the study of inhomogeneous phases , such as the charge - density wave ( cdw ) .",
    "this leads to the so called extended hubbard model ( ehm ) .    but",
    "knowing the appropriate model for the description of a material is only the first step on the way to understanding the physics .",
    "already for the simple hubbard model without non - local coulomb interaction , an exact calculation of static and dynamic properties is possible in very special cases only and one has to be content with approximate methods in general . for the interesting case where the coulomb interaction @xmath1 is of the same order of magnitude as the bandwith @xmath2 , the conventional perturbative approach must fail .",
    "this is expected for weak - coupling perturbation theory but also for the complementary approach with exact treatment of the interaction part and perturbative treatment of the kinetic energy .",
    "@xcite    numerical methods are more promising , such as quantum monte carlo ( qmc),@xcite exact diagonalisation ( ed ) , and density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg).@xcite they are able to give essentially exact results  at least for limited system sizes or ( dmrg ) for the one dimensional case .",
    "another non - perturbative approach is the mean - field method and , in the context of the hubbard model , the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) , @xcite in particular .",
    "while the dmft directly works in the thermodynamic limit of infinite system size , it must be regarded as a strong approximation since spatial correlations are neglected altogether .",
    "cluster generalizations of the dmft include at least short - range correlations via the exact treatment of a small cluster instead of considering a single impurity only . both , a reciprocal - space ( dynamical cluster approximation , dca@xcite ) and a real - space construction ( cellular dynamical mean field theory , c - dmft @xcite ) have been suggested .",
    "essentially the same idea is followed with the cluster perturbation theory ( cpt),@xcite which is a cluster extension of the strong - coupling expansion for the hubbard model : the lattice is divided into small clusters which are solved exactly while the hopping between adjacent clusters is treated perturbatively .",
    "the lowest order of the strong - coupling expansion in the inter - cluster hopping yields the cpt .",
    "short range correlations on the scale of the cluster are taken into account exactly , for instance by the lanczos technique at zero temperature , while correlations on a scale larger than the cluster size are neglected .",
    "the cpt is a systematic approach with respect to the cluster size , i.e.  the method becomes exact in the limit @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of sites within a cluster .",
    "it allows for the calculation of the single - electron green s function at arbitrary values of the wave vector @xmath5 .",
    "this is a considerable improvement compared to standard lanczos calculations for small clusters , where only a few @xmath5 points are available .",
    "the cpt has been successfully used to describe spectral properties of the high-@xmath6 materials,@xcite and has already been extended to finite temperatures.@xcite    recently a new method has been proposed which exploits a general variational principle for the self - energy of a system of interacting fermions . this self - energy - functional approach",
    "( sfa)@xcite approximates the self energy of the original system in the thermodynamic limit by the self energy of an exactly solvable reference system with the same interaction part .",
    "the self energy is varied by varying the single - particle parameters of the reference system .",
    "choosing the reference system to be a cluster of finite size yields a non - perturbative and consistent cluster approach .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that within this framework the cpt as well as the c - dmft appear as special approaches depending on the number of additional uncorrelated ( `` bath '' ) sites taken into account : the optimum number of bath sites is actually a free parameter which can be determined from the general variational principle .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that at least for one - dimensional models a large cluster without bath sites has to be preferred .",
    "the use of a reference system without bath sites represents a generalized cpt in which the single - particle parameters of the finite cluster are optimized according to the variational principle .",
    "this `` variational cpt '' ( v - cpt ) has successfully been used in a recent study for the investigation of the symmetry - broken antiferromagnetic phase of the two - dimensional hubbard model.@xcite    so far a consistent formulation of the ( variational ) cluster - perturbation approach could be achieved for lattice models with on - site interactions only .",
    "the reason for this restriction is that within the sfa the reference system must be chosen with the same interaction as the original model . as detailed in ref .",
    ", this ensures that functionals given by the skeleton - diagram expansion are the same for both , the original and the reference model . in case of the ehm",
    "the interaction couples the different sites of the lattice .",
    "thus there is no reference system with the same interaction which consists of decoupled subsystems of finite size .",
    "the motivation of the present paper is therefore to extend the ideas of the cpt and v - cpt to the investigation of the ehm including nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction .",
    "it is shown that a mean - field decoupling of the inter - cluster nearest - neighbor interaction yields a systematic and reliable cluster approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec : vcpt ] we give a short description of the v - cpt method , sec.[sec : decoupling ] shows how to decouple clusters in the case of the ehm . in sec.[sec:1d ] and sec.[sec:2d ] we present results for one and two dimensions , respectively .",
    "the conclusions are given in sec.[sec : concl ] .",
    "let us consider a system of interacting fermions on a lattice with hamiltonian @xmath7 , in general consisting of a single - particle part @xmath8 and an interaction part @xmath9 .",
    "the lattice is then divided into clusters , where it is of crucial importance for the derivation of the method that those clusters are connected by @xmath8 only .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be written as @xmath10+\\sum_{{{\\mathbf r}},{{\\mathbf r}}^\\prime}h_0^{{(\\mbox{\\small i})}}({{\\mathbf r}},{{\\mathbf r}}^\\prime),\\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes the individual clusters , @xmath12 is the part of the single - particle term that acts only inside a single cluster , @xmath13 is the interaction part inside the cluster , and the inter - cluster hopping is given by @xmath14 where the hopping matrix @xmath15 is non - zero only for hopping processes across the cluster boundaries .",
    "the indices @xmath16 and @xmath17 are general quantum numbers within a cluster , e.g. position and spin index , and @xmath18 creates an electron with quantum number @xmath16 in cluster @xmath11 .",
    "the quantity of interest is the single particle green s function @xmath19 .",
    "using translational invariance at the level of the superlattice vector @xmath11 , the green s function becomes diagonal with respect to the wave vector @xmath20 from the reduced brillouin zone corresponding to the superlattice .",
    "the resulting green s function in reciprocal space is a matrix @xmath21 with elements @xmath22 and @xmath23 quantum numbers within a cluster .    within the cpt approximation",
    "this green s function @xmath21 can be expressed in terms of green s functions of the decoupled clusters @xmath24 , again matrices in the quantum numbers @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the inter - cluster hopping @xmath15 by the expression @xmath25^{-1}\\ ] ] with the fourier - transformed inter - cluster hopping @xmath26 for the details of the derivation of the cpt formulas we refer the interested reader to refs . and references therein .",
    "we want to mention that one can transform eq.([eq : cpt_gq ] ) into a dyson - like equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the free green s function of the infinite lattice , and @xmath29 is the cluster self energy . in other words",
    "cpt consists of approximating the self energy of the infinite system by the self energy of a cluster of finite size . note that cpt is based on the exact evaluation of small clusters without any self - consistency procedure , and thus does not allow for the occurrence of symmetry - broken phases .",
    "this restriction is overcome with the v - cpt method.@xcite    the observation underlying v - cpt is that the perturbation term need not necessarily be restricted to the inter - cluster hopping term but can be any single - particle operator . for this reason one has a certain amount of freedom for the partitioning of the single - particle part of eq.([eq : ham_decoupled ] ) .",
    "namely , the hamiltonian eq.([eq : ham_decoupled ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath30 with an arbitrary intra - cluster single - particle operator @xmath31 which can for instance be a fictitious symmetry - breaking field , thus allowing for broken symmetry already on a finite system instead of only in the thermodynamic limit . in the non - interacting case , where eq.([eq : cpt_gq ] ) is exact,@xcite the result is independent of the transformation eq.([eq : transf ] ) , but in the interacting case",
    "the result depends on the particular choice .",
    "however , this dependence is not a shortcoming of the method but can rather be used for an optimization procedure .",
    "the question of what choice for @xmath32 will optimize the results can be answered by the sfa.@xcite it provides a way to exactly evaluate the grand potential @xmath33 $ ] as functional of the self - energy @xmath34 by restricting the domain of the functional to a certain subspace @xmath35 of trial self - energies .",
    "this subspace consists of all @xmath34 which are exact self - energies of the reference system for different @xmath36 .",
    "the reference system @xmath37 must have the same interaction part as @xmath7 and must be exactly solvable for any @xmath36 . throughout the paper we use a cluster of finite size as reference system .",
    "the cluster self - energy can be parametrized as @xmath38 .",
    "within the sfa , the optimal value of @xmath36 is determined from the stationary point of the function@xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the grand potential of the reference system .",
    "the frequency sum runs over discrete matsubara frequencies @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the number of clusters or @xmath20 points , respectively , @xmath43 gives the temperature , and bold symbols denote matrices in the cluster indices @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "note that the fraction in the second line in eq.([eq : sfa_omega ] ) is the cpt green s function .",
    "the single - particle parameters @xmath36 can include all single - particle parameters of the original hamiltonian or only part of it , as well as additional terms , e.g. a fictitious staggered field .",
    "the more parameters are considered for the optimization problem , the larger is the subspace @xmath35 of trial self energies .",
    "the actual choice and number of parameters depends on the problem under consideration . for more details of the derivation of the method see ref ..",
    "note that the v - cpt method is superior to the cpt approach , since within the concept of v - cpt one gets the standard cpt formulas by setting the number of variational parameters @xmath36 to zero .",
    "a necessary condition for the applicability of the method is that the clusters are coupled by single - particle operators only . at this point",
    "it is easy to see that a straightforward application of the method to the ehm where the clusters are also coupled by coulomb interactions is not possible .",
    "however , we will show in sec.[sec : decoupling ] how one can decouple the lattice into clusters appropriate for the application of cpt even in the case of the ehm .",
    "we start from the hamiltonian of the extended hubbard model @xmath44 where @xmath45 indicate the position in the lattice , and for convenience we use a constant value @xmath46 for all nearest - neighbor bonds . according to eq.([eq : ham_decoupled ] ) we decouple the lattice into clusters yielding @xmath47\\nonumber\\\\      & + \\sum_{{{\\mathbf r}},{{\\mathbf r}}^\\prime }      \\left[h_0^{{(\\mbox{\\small i})}}({{\\mathbf r}},{{\\mathbf r}}^\\prime)+h_{\\rm v}^{{(\\mbox{\\small i})}}({{\\mathbf r}},{{\\mathbf r}}^\\prime)\\right],\\label{eq : ehm_decoupled}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first row includes only terms of a single cluster and the second row couples different clusters . by comparing the second row with the corresponding term in eq.([eq : ham_decoupled ] )",
    "one can see that the term causing problems in the case of the ehm is the interaction term @xmath48 } n_{{{\\mathbf r}}i}n_{{{\\mathbf r}}^\\prime j},\\ ] ] which is of two - particle type .",
    "the symbol @xmath49 $ ] indicates that the sum runs only over bonds connecting nearest neighbors in different clusters . for nearest - neighbor interactions",
    "this means that the indices in @xmath49 $ ] must belong to the cluster boundaries of two adjacent clusters . for the application of the method derived in sec.[sec : vcpt ] the coupling term must be of single - particle type , which can be achieved by a mean - field decoupling of the interaction term eq.([eq : ehm_int_term ] ) .",
    "hence we get @xmath50 } \\left[n_{{{\\mathbf r}}i}\\langle n_{{{\\mathbf r}}^\\prime        j}\\rangle + \\langle   n_{{{\\mathbf r}}i}\\rangle n_{{{\\mathbf r}}^\\prime j}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\    & -v\\sum_{[ij]}\\langle n_{{{\\mathbf",

    "we get @xmath56}\\left[n_{{{\\mathbf r}}i}\\lambda_j+n_{{{\\mathbf r}}^\\prime j}\\lambda_i-\\lambda_i\\lambda_j\\right]\\nonumber\\\\    & = v\\sum_{{{\\mathbf r}}}\\sum_{[ij]}\\left[n_{{{\\mathbf r}}i}\\lambda_j+n_{{{\\mathbf r}}j}\\lambda_i-\\lambda_i\\lambda_j\\right]\\nonumber\\\\     & = \\sum_{{{\\mathbf r}}}h_{\\rm v , mf}^{{(\\mbox{\\small i})}}({{\\mathbf r}}).\\label{eq : ehm_mf_approx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the double sum over @xmath11 and @xmath53 reduces to a single sum , because for fixed values of @xmath11 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 only one term of the sum over @xmath53 contributes due to the fact that two - site interactions couple at most two different clusters .",
    "one has to be careful in order to avoid double counting of the bonds @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "for instance , for a one - dimensional cluster of length @xmath59 , eq.([eq : ehm_mf_approx ] ) reduces to @xmath60,\\ ] ] because the only decoupled bond connects sites @xmath61 and @xmath59 of different clusters .    by this mean - field decoupling ,",
    "two parameters @xmath54 are introduced for each decoupled bond , e.g. @xmath62 and @xmath63 in one dimension , and in general all these parameters @xmath54 are independent of each other .",
    "but as we will see below , the number of mean - field parameters @xmath54 can be strongly reduced in special cases .",
    "the decoupled interaction eq.([eq : ehm_mf_approx ] ) is of single - particle type and can be included in the intra - cluster hopping term @xmath12 , leading to a modified intra - cluster single - particle term @xmath64 where we explicitly denoted the dependence on the parameters @xmath54 .",
    "after mean - field decoupling we finally get the hamiltonian @xmath65\\nonumber\\\\       & + \\sum_{{{\\mathbf r}},{{\\mathbf r}}^\\prime }      h_0^{{(\\mbox{\\small i})}}({{\\mathbf r}},{{\\mathbf r}}^\\prime),\\label{eq : ehm_mf_decoupled}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for which the method described in sec.[sec : vcpt ] is applicable .    from the decoupling of the clusters we have got additional parameters @xmath54 which are external parameters to the hamiltonian eq.([eq : ehm_mf_decoupled ] ) and have to be determined in a proper way .",
    "for this purpose we propose two different procedures :    \\(i ) one can get the parameters from a self - consistent calculation on an isolated cluster .",
    "that means that one starts with a certain guess for the @xmath54 , which are the expectation values of the electron densities on sites @xmath57 .",
    "then the ground - state wave function of an isolated cluster is calculated , giving new values for the @xmath54 . in this step",
    "open boundary conditions ( obc ) are used in order to be consistent with the obc necessary for the calculation of the cluster green s function in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cpt_gq ] ) and  ( [ eq : sfa_omega ] ) .",
    "these new values @xmath54 serve as parameters in the hamiltonian for the next determination of the ground state , and the whole procedure is iterated until convergence of the @xmath54 is achieved .",
    "this procedure may work quite well for the ehm in the case of a first order phase transition between a disordered and an ordered phase , because ( due to an avoided level crossing ) the transition point , i.e. the critical coulomb interaction @xmath66 , is almost independent of the cluster size.@xcite for second order phase transitions we expect that this method will not give satisfactory results , because here we face a discrepancy between the parameters calculated on the isolated cluster and the parameters that would give the optimal result in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "\\(ii ) the shortcoming in the case of second order phase transitions can be overcome in the following way : as we show in app .",
    "[ app : mf ] , the self - consistent calculation of mean - field parameters is equivalent to the minimization of the free energy @xmath67 . since the relation @xmath68 holds at @xmath69 , this minimization can be done at the same time as the optimization of the single - particle parameters @xmath36 in the sfa formalism , and we can use eq.([eq : sfa_omega ] ) for the determination of the parameters @xmath54 , too .",
    "note that all quantities in eq.([eq : sfa_omega ] ) which depend on the single - particle parameters @xmath36 are dependent on the mean - field parameters @xmath54 as well . to keep the calculations simple we consider only half - filled systems , where it is sufficient to use only two different values for the @xmath54 , namely @xmath70 and @xmath71 on sublattices @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively . under this assumption",
    "we have only one mean - field parameter @xmath74 , and the grand potential is @xmath75 .",
    "the general procedure is now , that for each value of @xmath74 the stationary point with respect to @xmath36 has to be found as required by the sfa formalism , yielding a function @xmath76 . by finding the minimum of this function",
    "one can determine the optimal value for @xmath74 .",
    "conceptually , the latter method ( ii ) of determining the mean - field parameters is superior to the procedure ( i ) described first as it uses information on the green s function in the thermodynamic limit for the calculation of @xmath74 .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that for each choice of @xmath74 the green s function @xmath24 of the isolated cluster has to be calculated many times to evaluate eq.([eq : sfa_omega ] ) which is much more time consuming than the self - consistency procedure on the isolated cluster .",
    "the hamiltonian of the one - dimensional ehm is given by @xmath77 throughout the paper we set @xmath78 as the unit of energy .",
    "although this model was studied intensively in recent years , the ground state phase diagram is still under some discussion.@xcite we use this model as a testing ground for our method , because many results are available for comparison .",
    "the chemical potential is @xmath79 due to particle - hole symmetry at half - filling .",
    "schematic phase diagram of the one - dimensional ehm taken from refs .  .",
    "the thick line marks the first order phase transition , and the dashed line marks @xmath80.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in one dimension at half filling , the ehm shows an involved phase diagram including spin density wave ( sdw ) , charge density wave ( cdw ) , and bond order wave ( bow ) phases as shown schematically in fig.[fig : shem_phasediagram ] .",
    "there is good agreement on the existence of the latter phase , but its extension in the @xmath1-@xmath81-plane has not yet been clarified in detail.@xcite moreover , a multi - critical point occurs at some critical value @xmath82 , where the phase transition into the ordered cdw phase changes from a second order transition at lower values to a first order transition at higher values .",
    "recent qmc studies@xcite gave @xmath83 for this point in good agreement with @xmath84-ology @xcite and bosonization results,@xcite whereas dmrg gives a somewhat lower value @xmath85.@xcite      for a first test of our method we studied the one - dimensional ehm at @xmath86 , which is well above the multi - critical point .",
    "the phase transition is then of first order without any bow phase between sdw and cdw phases . as reference system @xmath37 according to sec.[sec : vcpt ] , we used decoupled clusters of different lengths consisting of @xmath87 , 10 , and 12 sites , respectively . for the determination of the mean - field parameter @xmath74 we used the method ( ii ) described in sec.[sec : decoupling ] , where @xmath74 is calculated from the minimum of the free energy of the system . for the sfa optimization of the single - particle parameters , we had to choose a set @xmath36 of parameters which are varied in the optimization procedure . in order to minimize the number of relevant parameters we used results of a recent study of the hubbard model.@xcite there it has been shown that at @xmath86 the variation of the hopping in the cluster yields only minor changes that can be neglected , and that open boundary conditions have to be used .",
    "moreover , for the one - dimensional hubbard model it has been pointed out that the use of a fictitious staggered magnetic field as a variational parameter gives a stationary point of the grand potential only for vanishing field , yielding a paramagnetic phase without long - range magnetic order .",
    "since it can be assumed that these results are also valid in a similar way for the ehm , we did not use the hopping in the cluster or a staggered magnetic field in the optimization procedure .",
    "here we studied charge - ordering effects and therefore we used as variational parameter a staggered field coupled to the charge densities given by eq.([eq : add_onepartop ] ) with @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the wave vector of staggered ordering and @xmath90 is the staggered - field strength .",

    "calculations without optimization of the staggered field are shown as dashed lines in fig.[fig : gp_1du8 ] .",
    "as one can see , the optimization gives only minor changes to @xmath94 .",
    "the optimal staggered - field strengths in these calculations varied between @xmath95 at @xmath96 and @xmath97 at @xmath98 at both values of @xmath81 .    from the shape of @xmath94 one can directly infer the order of the transition . if three minima occur at @xmath99 and @xmath100 , it is of first order , whereas it is of second order if @xmath94 has only two minima at @xmath100 and a maximum at @xmath99 . as on",
    "can easily see in fig.[fig : gp_1du8 ] , we have clear evidence for a first order phase transition at @xmath86 with an sdw minimum at @xmath96 and two degenerate cdw minima at @xmath101 . at @xmath92",
    "the sdw phase is realized , @xmath102 , whereas at @xmath93 we have @xmath103 and the cdw phase is the stable one .",
    "thus we can state that the critical value @xmath66 for the phase transition is located between @xmath92 and @xmath93 .    for a more accurate determination of the phase boundary @xmath66 ,",
    "we have calculated the grand potential at several values of @xmath81 and cluster sizes @xmath87 , 10 , and 12 .",
    "in addition to the grand potential and the ground state energy @xmath104 with @xmath105 the number of electrons in the system , we calculated the order parameter @xmath106 where @xmath89 , @xmath4 is the number of cluster sites , and the kinetic energy @xmath107 .",
    "both properties can be extracted from the spectral function @xmath108 .",
    "the kinetic energy is obtained after fourier - transformation@xcite @xmath109 by @xmath110 with @xmath111 the dispersion of the non - interacting system . within our approach",
    "it is necessary to use the lehmann representation for the cluster green s function with small but finite lorentzian broadening @xmath112 . whereas the grand potential eq.([eq : sfa_omega ] ) shows only minor dependence on this broadening , the dependence of the order parameter and the kinetic energy is considerably larger and one has to do an extrapolation to @xmath113.@xcite although the formalism applies to the thermodynamic limit , results show a finite size dependence due to the finite size of the clusters serving as reference system .",
    "we found that the order parameter exhibits the strongest finite - size effects , which were of the order @xmath114 at all values of @xmath81 .",
    "finite - size scaling to @xmath115 is easily done and the results for the ground state energy extracted from the minimum of the grand potential , the kinetic energy and the order parameter are shown in fig.[fig : res_1du8 ] .",
    "our results should be compared to fig.10 of ref . which shows excellent quantitative agreement with a deviation of less than 2% for the calculated quantities at all values of @xmath81 . from our calculations we get @xmath116 , again in agreement with the previous studies refs ..",
    "ground state energy @xmath117 , kinetic energy @xmath107 , and order parameter @xmath118 of the one - dimensional ehm at @xmath86 after finite size scaling .",
    "lines are guides to the eye only.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]             in order to provide a complete picture of the method we also performed calculations with mean - field parameters obtained by a self - consistent procedure on an isolated cluster , see method ( i ) in sec.[sec : decoupling ] .",
    "for instance for @xmath119 and @xmath92 one finds self - consistent solutions for @xmath99 and for @xmath120 , which differs only slightly from the value extracted from the grand potential , @xmath121 . for this reason",
    "the calculation of the ground - state energy , kinetic energy , and order parameter using @xmath122 instead of @xmath123 gives practically the same results as in fig.[fig : res_1du8 ] .",
    "in the present case it is therefore sufficient to calculate the mean - field parameter from an isolated cluster which is much faster than finding the minimum of the grand potential .",
    "whereas the properties we have shown so far are well known for the one - dimensional ehm , we additionally calculated for the first time the spectral function by eq.([eq : akw_ft ] ) for arbitrary wave vector @xmath5 .",
    "in fig.[fig : akw_1du8 ] results are shown at @xmath86 and selected values of @xmath81 with a reference system consisting of @xmath119 cluster sites , and the mean - field parameter @xmath74 calculated self - consistently by method ( i ) , see sec.[sec : decoupling ] .",
    "we want to mention that the striped structure , particularly visible in the regions marked by c in fig.[fig : akw_1du8 ] , occurs because the decoupling into clusters breaks the translational invariance of the system .",
    "the spectral function at @xmath124 is very similar to the spectral function of the hubbard model ( @xmath125)@xcite with splitting of the low - energy band into a spinon and an holon band , which are marked in fig.[fig : akw_1du8 ] by a and b , respectively .",
    "this similarity could have already been expected based on the full hartree - fock solution  decoupling of all interaction terms in the hamiltonian  where one has no dependence on @xmath81 at all in the sdw phase .",
    "but this simple picture holds only away from the transition point @xmath66 as can be seen in fig.[fig : akw_1du8 ] in the plot at @xmath126 . at this point , in the vicinity of the phase transition @xmath127 ,",
    "the gap is considerably smaller than at @xmath124 , a clear deviation from the hartree - fock prediction .",
    "this indicates that charge fluctuations become very important in this regime , which are completely neglected by the hartree - fock approximation , but are taken into account on the length scale of the cluster in our approach .",
