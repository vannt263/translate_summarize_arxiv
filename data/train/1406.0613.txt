    "galactic low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are classified into two different types , neutron star binary and black hole x - ray binary ( bhxb ) .",
    "while some of lmxbs are persistently on , most of the bhxbs are thought to be transients that are normally in a quiescent state and occasionally exhibit episodic brightening called `` outburst '' .",
    "the outburst is triggered by sudden increase of mass accretion rate onto the compact star .",
    "there are two competing models that regulate the accretion flow , namely , `` mass transfer instability model '' @xcite and `` disk thermal instability model '' @xcite .    during the outburst , bhxbs change its x - ray luminosity in several orders of magnitude and transit through two major spectral states , `` soft state '' and `` hard state '' .",
    "the x - ray spectrum in the soft state ( hereafrer ss ) is characterized by an ultra - soft component which originates from optically - thick and geometrically - thin accretion disk , called `` standard disk '' @xcite .",
    "many observations show that the inner - most radius @xmath5 remains constant irrespective of variation of the inner most temperature .",
    "therefore , the @xmath5 is believed to reflect the inner stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "the hard state ( hereafrer hs ) is approximated by a single power - law with a photon index 1.42.0 and a high - energy cutoff at @xmath6100 kev .",
    "@xcite successfully explained this emission by thermal comptonization of soft seed photons in the hot corona .",
    "the seed photons are believed to come from the standard disk which is truncated in a large @xmath5 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the hysteresis in x - ray intensity between the hs - to - ss and ss - to - hs state transitions produces a q - shaped track in a hardness intensity diagram , called `` q - curve '' @xcite .    past x - ray observations of bhxbs including _ rxte _ and revealed a variety of light - curve profiles among bhxbs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "`` x - ray nova '' is a subclass of these bhxb transients , which includes a0620@xmath000 @xcite , gs1124@xmath068 @xcite , gs 2000@xmath725 @xcite and gro j0422@xmath732 @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by a simple light - curve profile of fast - rise and exponential - decay normally followed by late _ re - flaring _ @xcite .",
    "the simple profile allows us to study accretion inflow of the black - hole binary system apart from complicated behavior around the inner disk .",

    "swift burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) independently detected the source @xcite .",
    "therefore , this source is also referred to as swift  j1910.2@xmath00546 .",
    "the first pointing observation , performed at 2012 june 1 14:41 ( mjd 56079.611806 ) , refined the source position to ( r.a . , dec ) ( j2000 )  @xmath1  ( , ) ( @xcite ) with an uncertainty of radius .",

    "these software are utilized in the on - demand data processing system accessed viea web interface@xcite , where the latest calibration information is applied . in the period of interest in this paper , six gsc counters out of the twelve were turned on , and others were kept off for redundancy @xcite .",
    "we utilized data of gsc # 0 , 2 , 7 operated at the high voltage of 1550 v and of gsc # 4 , 5 at 1650 v. here we did not utilize gsc#3 because it was degraded and not suitable for spectral analysis .",
    "the x - ray event data archived as the gsc event revision 1.4 was used .",

    "the energy gain was corrected by using copper k@xmath16 emission line from the ssc camera body , and the gain temperature dependence was also corrected .",
    "since the ssc data were contaminated by the visible / infrared light from the sun and moon @xcite , we selected data taken during the iss night time , and then eliminated such events that the angular separation from the moon is @xmath17 . in this manner , we collected 844 transits of 22.2 @xmath15 ks . to avoid thermal noise due to relatively higher ccd temperature , we ignored energy bin below 0.7 kev , above 7 kev dominated by background . since the response function of ssc has calibration uncertainties of about 10% in normalization , we performed simultaneous model fits to both gsc and ssc spectral data introducing a cross normalization factor .",
    "we set the factor equal to 1.0 in gsc , and let free in ssc .      since the discovery of the new x - ray source , maxi  j1910@xmath0057 ( @xmath1 swift  j1910.2@xmath00546 ) , @xcite pointing observations were carried out with x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and uv optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) every one to @xmath6ten day interval .",
    "due to the sun angle constraint , no observations were available from 2012 november 26 to 2013 march 9 .",

    "we integrated image using uvotimsum , and then estimated background carefully from the source free region .",
    "the burst alert telescope ( bat ) on is an all - sky monitor to search for gamma - ray bursts . while searching for bursts , it is capable of monitoring hard x - ray sources .",

    "gsc scanned the source almost every day since the mission started in 2009 august .",
    "we investigated the gsc event data before the outburst onset .",
    "however , no significant excess over the background was detected .",
    "the hardness variation implies that the source exhibited spectral transition between hs and ss .",
    "hence , we divided the entire periods into five intervals , labeled as hs1 ( @xmath19 3 d ) , ss1 ( 3 d @xmath20 66 d ) , hs2 ( 66 d @xmath20 102 d ) , ss2 ( 102 d @xmath20 132 d ) , and hs3 ( 132 d @xmath21 ) in figure [ fig : lc ] , according to the hr1 below / above @xmath22 . or hr2 below / above 0.2 .",

    "this caused the state transition from hs1 to ss1 .",
    "while the x - ray emission in the soft state is dominated by a soft component , a weak hard x - ray peak was also seen at around @xmath29 d @xcite . in the ss1 ,",
    "the 26 kev flux declined steady , but the 620 kev turned to increase at @xmath30 d , and then the source returned to the hard state ( hs2 ) @xcite .",
    "after @xmath31 d , the source repearted the same state - change cycle of the hard(hs2)-soft(ss2)-hard(hs3 ) while the intensity declined gradually . in the hs3 , the x - ray intensity varied to some degree keeping a hard spectrum .",
    "further decay began around @xmath32 d , and gone below both gsc and bat detection limits after @xmath33 d.    the uv light curve showed similar shape to soft x - ray light curve from ss1 until @xmath34 140 d. however , it showed a clear deviation after then .",
    "the correlation between uv and x - ray is studied in section [ x - uv_corr ] .",
    "the entire structures of light curve is characterized with a fast rise and an exponential decay , followed by a re - flaring and latter long tail .",
    "this feature resembles the classical black hole x - ray novae @xcite .",
    "we investigate x - ray spectral evolution during the entire outburst using data with a continuous time coverage and xrt data with a high sensitivity .",
    "because daily data taken by gsc and ssc do not have enough photon statistics except for the initial bright phase , we accumulated spectral data for periods of several days for each of gsc and ssc .",

    "if we assume that the soft - to - hard transition fluxes of 1.282.33 @xmath69 obtained in section [ xray_spec ] lie in this @xmath70 range , then the hatched region in figure [ fig : mass_dist ] can be derived , and the minimum and maximum masses are obtained as 2.9 @xmath71 for @xmath72 kpc and 12.9 @xmath71 for @xmath73 kpc , respectively . the lower limit close to 3 @xmath71 is consistent with a picture that the central star is a black hole as assumed in the mass derivation .",

    "thus , it is possible that the observed energy and time dependent dip is caused by a low mass - accretion - rate ( dark ring ) region taking place at an outer part of the disk and drifting inward . from the sed at @xmath87 d ( figure [ fig : uvot_sed](d ) )",
    ", a ratio of the x - ray - flux - peak energy @xmath88 to the uvot ( filter ) central energy ( 2246  ) @xmath89 , @xmath90 , is @xmath91 .",

    "we ignore the effect of the irradiation here .",
    "this uv radiation radius is comparable to the radius estimated from the viscous time scale for 6 days of optical - to - x - rays time lags @xcite though the viscous time scale has the uncertainty of one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "it is interesting to note that the viscous time scale is also known as the ( radial ) _ drift _ time scale @xcite and the _ diffusion _ time scale @xcite .",
    "thus , the time lags ( @xmath96 days ) and the comparable diffusion time ( @xmath97 days ) we obtained are consistent with the above picture .",
    "the dip might be also associated with the bright 3rd maximum around @xmath98 d because a similar x - ray flux drop before the 3rd maximum was also observed in a  0620 - 00 @xcite .",
    "an apparent flux excess over the exponential decay implies enhancement of a mass - accretion rate by an extra mass input to the disk .",
    "if the accretion rate decreases at an outer part of the disk , a transition into a cool ( @xmath99 k ) branch of a hydrogen neutral state sets in @xcite . in the cool branch , the viscosity is so small that the mass accretion once stagnates there .",
    "this might result in the dark ring region just inside it .",
    "the transition also causes a vertical shrink of the outer disk , allowing irradiation to the companion star .",
    "this gives rise to an additional mass transfer to the accretion disk invoked by mass transfer instability ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the disk backs to a hot branch of a hydrogen ionized state .",
    "finally , we also note that the uv dip might be partially triggered by the transition because the temperature of the hot branch is about @xmath100 k , of which the peak energy is around 3.4 ev . as pointed out by @xcite",
    ", however , these scenarios can not explain the sudden nir color change ( bluer ) observed with the sharp drop in uvs .",
    "after @xmath101 d , @xmath76 and @xmath77 changed asymmetrically . from the fits to the swift / xrt plus uvot spectra with the reprocessed disk model ( figure [ fig : uvot_sed ] ) , a reprocessed fraction can be considered to be increasing with time . in the present data , however , we can not rule out other possibilities",
    ". the uv component might be due to other components such as a jet and/or an inner hot accretion flow ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the soft x - ray component also to an `` additional variable component '' @xcite , e.g. , x - ray shots with a soft x - ray spectrum and associated optical jets ( @xcite , @xcite ) , instead of the keplerian ( less variable ) disk component .",
    "we have presented light curves and spectral results of the entire outburst using data obtained by and of the x - ray nova maxij1910057 . the light curve was a fast - rise and exponential - decay type suggesting a disk thermal instability outburst . as well as past observations of x - ray novae , the broad third maximum was detected .",
    "the x - ray spectral state around the main peak and the third maximum were confirmed to be the ss . since the innermost radius kept roughly constant in the ss , and the relation between disk flux and temperature was approximated by @xmath102 , we interpreted the radius as an isco .",
    "the innermost radius became larger in the hard state .",
    "this suggests that the accretion disk was truncated .",
    "the x - ray fluxes of two series of `` hard - to - soft '' transitions agreed within a factor of two . by assuming that the `` hard - to - soft '' transitions occurs 14% of eddington luminosity , the lower limit of the black hole mass is estimated to be 2.9 @xmath71 .",
    "we also studied the relation between uv data in combination with x - ray data .",
    "their joint spectral analysis revealed that the uv emission is composed of direct mcd emission and its reprocessed emission from outer disk . using the sharp drop found in both the light curves , the profile of time delay is approximated with a gaussian profile centering at 3.5 days and the width of 3.8 days fwhm .",
    "we conclude that the time difference reflects changing mass accretion rate accreting inward , which possibly caused by local instability .",
    "this research has made use of data provided by riken , jaxa and the team .",
    "we also thank the team for their observation . this work made use of data supplied by the uk science data centre at the university of leicester .",

    "<S> the new x - ray transient was first detected on 2012 may 31 by gas slit camera ( gsc ) and burst alert telescope ( bat ) almost simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed x - ray and uv data for 270 days since the outburst onset taken by repeated scans and pointing observations . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained x - ray light curve for the inital 90 days is roughly represented by a fast - rise and exponential - decay profile . however , it re - brightened on the @xmath2 days after the onset and finally went down below both gsc and bat detection limits on the 240 day . </S>",
    "<S> all the x - ray energy spectra are fitted well with a model consisting of a multi - color - disk blackbody and its comptonized hard tail . during the soft - state periods , </S>",
    "<S> the inner - disk radius of the best - fit model were almost constant . </S>",
    "<S> if the radius represents the innermost stable circular orbit of a non - spinning black hole and the soft - to - hard transitions occur at 14% of the eddington luminosity , the mass of the compact object is estimated to be @xmath3 and the distance to be @xmath4 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the inner - disk radius became larger in the hard / hard - intermediate state . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the accretion disk would be truncated . </S>",
    "<S> we detected an excess of the uv flux over the disk blackbody component extrapolated from the x - ray data , which can be modelled as reprocessed emission irradiated by the inner disk . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the uv light curve mostly traced the x - ray curve , but a short dipping event was observed in both the uv and the x - ray bands with a 3.5-day x - ray time lag . </S>",
    "<S> this can be interpreted as the radial inflow of accreting matter from the outer uv region to the inner x - ray region . </S>"
