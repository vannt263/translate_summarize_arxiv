    "finally in the case of @xmath75 , @xmath60 exceeds one above the weak scale .",
    "then the mixing angle once becomes maximal at high energy , however , after there it decreases rapidly since the sign of @xmath72 $ ] changes .",
    "figures [ fig : sin ] are the contour plots of the mixing angle @xmath50 at the weak scale .",
    "these are obtained by solving eq.([eqn : rgekappa2b ] ) with the various @xmath70(horizontal axis ) and @xmath76(vertical axis ) . here",

    "[ fig : sin ] is the value at @xmath28 that induces @xmath78 . in the parameter region of @xmath79",

    "next in the case of @xmath80 , which means @xmath81 , the mixing angle at the weak scale is strongly enhanced near the weak scale , as the dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : engdepofsin ] . then the mixing angle at the weak scale becomes maximal independently of the mixing angle at @xmath28 .",
    "finally in the case of @xmath82 , the mixing angle at the weak scale becomes small even for the large mixing angle at @xmath28 , where the energy dependence of the mixing angle is similar to the dotted lines in figs .",

    "[ fig : sin ] , it is found that the region where the heaviest mass @xmath84 is larger than @xmath2 corresponds to the region where the mixing angle at the weak scale is always larger than 0.9 despite the small mixing at @xmath28 scale .",

    "compared with the case of @xmath88 , the value of @xmath77 are just shifted to the right in the case of @xmath87 . around @xmath80 , the value of @xmath84 is slightly larger than that of @xmath88 at the same value of @xmath50 . in general , the smaller @xmath47 becomes , the more @xmath77 approaches one , and the value of @xmath84 around @xmath80 becomes larger .",
    "the region where the maximal enhancement of the mixing angle is derived by the rge exists even in the case of small @xmath65 .",
    "the value of @xmath84 around @xmath77 becomes larger corresponding to the smaller value of @xmath47 .",
    "we stress here that the large enhancement factor at the weak scale induced by @xmath72 $ ] in is not the fine - tuning .",
    "this factor must be inevitably large with @xmath89 if @xmath90 and @xmath84 are larger than @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth noting that the enough enhancement of the mixing angle can be obtained even in the case of @xmath2 neutrino masses . even in the small @xmath65 ,",
    "@xmath91 mass is enough to obtain this rge enhancement .",

    "finally we give a brief comment about the lsnd experimental result . in the above mass spectrum ,",
