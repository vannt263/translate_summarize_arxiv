    "the term critical depletion was introduced in connection with experiments designed to study the phenomenon of critical adsorption for a pure fluid at a solid substrate  @xcite . when a fluid is brought to its bulk critical point in the presence of an attracting external wall or substrate , for example along a critical isochore",
    ", the amount adsorbed ( adsorption ) diverges as @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath2 is the critical temperature .",
    "theory  @xcite attributes these divergences to the fact that the wall causes a perturbation of the order parameter ( op ) profile @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the density profile , to extend over a distance @xmath11 , the bulk correlation length , from the surface .",
    "close to criticality , where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the critical exponent ) , the op profile differs from its bulk value ( fixed by the properties of the reservoir far from the substrate ) over macroscopic distances and the adsorption can be a diverging quantity .",
    "fisher and de gennes  @xcite postulated that near criticality the op profile should be described in terms of a universal scaling function , i.e. sufficiently close to @xmath2 and for sufficiently strongly attracting walls @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a universal scaling function and argued that as @xmath16 along the critical isochore ( @xmath17 ) the adsorption @xmath1 takes on the asymptotic , universal form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the distance measured normal to the substrate , located at @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the critical exponent describing the vanishing of the bulk op and @xmath22 for ising magnets or fluids . in ref .",
    "@xcite measurements were performed for sf@xmath0 adsorbed on a finely divided ( colloidal ) graphite adsorbent ( vulcan 3@xmath23 ) . the volumetric method employed in these experiments measured @xmath3 directly on approaching the critical point along the critical or near - critical isochores .",
    "although @xmath3 increased as @xmath24 was reduced , consistent with  ( [ eq : scaladsorp ] ) , close to @xmath2 ( @xmath25 ) the adsorption reached a maximum and decreased sharply taking on negative values very close to @xmath2 .",
    "microgravity experiments by the same group confirmed these results  @xcite .",
    "the critical depletion of @xmath1 was attributed to the confining effects of colloidal particles on the near critical fluid and new experiments , designed to test this conjecture , were performed on the sorption of sf@xmath0 in a mesoporous glass cpg-350 , which comprises a rigid interconnected system of mesopores with a nominal pore diameter of 31 nm . for the rigid porous material the measured adsorption showed a very similar temperature dependence to that found for the colloidal graphite adsorbent .",
    "these experimental results have stimulated several simulation  @xcite and theoretical studies  @xcite aimed at understanding the origin of the striking behaviour of @xmath1 and , in particular , to answer the fundamental question as to whether critical depletion is a single pore phenomenon , as is for example capillary - condensation  @xcite which arises from the combined effects of wall - fluid forces and finite - size and which manifests itself in simple confining geometries .",
    "the grand canonical monte carlo simulations  @xcite of a lennard - jones fluid confined between two structureless , attractive planar walls did indicate that the average , local density in the middle of this slit - pore could fall below @xmath26 under near - critical conditions thereby leading to depletion .",
    "however , it has been shown recently that the depletion found in  @xcite is an artifact of the simulation procedure  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies  @xcite of the simplest model of a confined fluid , namely the lattice gas subject to identical surface fields located at the two walls , revealed a physical mechanism which could cause a dramatic decrease of the adsorption @xmath3 on approaching @xmath2 along near - critical isochores .",
    "consider the situation when the density of the bulk reservoir is slightly lower than critical .",
    "transcription of the lattice gas into the ising model sets the chemical potential difference @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the chemical potential on the critical isochore and @xmath29 is the bulk magnetic field .",
    "thus for @xmath30 , @xmath31 and the bulk field favours the dilute ( gas ) phase .",
    "if the surface fields are sufficiently attractive that they favour adsorption of the dense ( liquid ) phase then one has a competition between bulk and surface fields which influences the shape of the op profile and hence the behaviour of the adsorption in the slit - pore .",
    "when the pore is large and when the bulk correlation length is much smaller than the width of the pore @xmath32 , then the fluid in the middle part of the pore should behave as a bulk fluid .",
    "for weak @xmath29 , the bulk op ( magnetization ) in the critical region behaves as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the susceptibility . near the walls , on the other hand ,",
    "the fluid should behave as in the semi - infinite near critical system subject to the surface field .",
    "bulk and surface fields give diverging contributions , but of opposite sign , to the adsorption @xmath1 for @xmath35 . for large pore widths and for @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is defined by @xmath38 ,",
    "the adsorption can be approximated , for @xmath39 , by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are positive amplitudes .",
    "since @xmath43 the second term always dominates for @xmath44 sufficiently close to @xmath2 provided @xmath45 is sufficiently strong and , as a consequence , depletion of @xmath1 will occur . for even smaller @xmath24 , such that @xmath46 , the adsorption saturates at a value which depends on @xmath29 and on the surface field .",
    "the lattice gas model of a single pore predicts critical depletion for @xmath47 only .",
    "for the case of the critical isochore @xmath48 , the bulk field @xmath49 and as @xmath24 is reduced @xmath3 first increases monotonically following the fisher - de gennes power law and eventually saturates taking on a positive value at @xmath50 @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "this scenario was confirmed by explicit mean - field lattice gas calculations  @xcite and for two dimensional ising films , with bulk and surface fields of opposite sign , by density matrix renormalization group calculations  @xcite . in the latter case",
    "it was shown that the near - critical fluctuations can lead to an even richer variation of @xmath52 .",
    "for certain values of @xmath29 , in addition to the maximum , a minimum of @xmath1 appears where the correlation length approaches the pore width and the competition between the effect of adsorbing walls and the large susceptibility of the central region ( favouring the dilute phase ) becomes particularly strong .",
    "for weak @xmath39 the results for @xmath52 obtained in the lattice gas ( ising ) model of a single pore look very similar to those measured in the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite . in the experiments for sf@xmath0 adsorbed in the controlled pore glass",
    "the actual isochores correspond to densities lower than critical , i.e. @xmath53 and 0.999 , so that @xmath54 .",
    "it is tempting then to argue that since @xmath54 there is an effective bulk field @xmath39 which competes with the surface fields to give rise to critical depletion .",
    "although this is a plausible explanation of the observed phenomenon it does not take into account the actual situation in a fluid .",
    "for example , if the bulk density @xmath55 is fixed according to the experimental condition of the fluid reservoir , @xmath56 as defined by  ( [ eq : transcr ] ) will vary as @xmath44 approaches @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding bulk magnetic field will vary in the same way . in the present paper",
    "we show that taking into account the temperature dependence of @xmath56 has a profound effect on the behaviour of confined fluids near @xmath2 .",
    "in particular we find that under the experimental conditions of ref .",
    "@xcite a simple fluid confined in a single slit pore should not exhibit critical depletion . rather the adsorption should increase monotonically as @xmath16 .",
    "this implies that an explanation of the experimental observations is still lacking .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we reconsider the physical mechanism which leads to critical depletion of adsorption in the case of the lattice gas model of a pore considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and give a heuristic argument as to why this phenomenon should not be expected for real fluids when the reservoir density is fixed according to experimental conditions .",
    "our argument is supported by explicit calculations of @xmath1 using the density functional approach and by grand canonical monte carlo simulations of the lennard - jones fluid in a slit - pore . in sec .  [",
    "sec : denfun ] we report density functional results obtained from a square gradient approximation to the free energy functional and short - ranged ( contact ) wall - fluid potentials . both classical and non - classical bulk free - energy densities",
    "are employed and and in the classical case we investigate two forms of the free energy density , namely the landau model free energy and the free energy of the lennard - jones fluid as obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from an accurate fit to simulation data .",
    "sec.4 describes the computer simulations of the density profiles and adsorption of the lennard - jones fluid on the critical isochore and for a sub - critical isochore @xmath7 .",
    "results are presented for various strengths of the 4 - 10 and 3 - 9 wall - fluid potentials .",
    "we conclude in sec.5 with a discussion of the relevance of our findings for the experiments described earlier .",
    "here we reconsider the scaling argument  @xcite that predicts critical depletion in the lattice gas model of a single pore and modify it to incoroprate two features that are relevant for the case of fluids .",
    "first , in order to mimic the experimental situation more closely one should account for the fact that @xmath57 will vary as the temperature @xmath44 approaches @xmath2 at constant @xmath55 .",
    "this implies that the corresponding bulk magnetic field @xmath29 should also vary with @xmath44 and therefore that the second term of the approximate formula ( [ eq : adsapprox ] ) for the adsorption @xmath3 might have a different @xmath24 dependence .",
    "this in turn may affect the result of the competition between the bulk and surface fields .",
    "second the lattice gas model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite has an exact particle - hole symmetry , which corresponds to the trivial symmetry under reversal of the field @xmath29 in the equivalent ising model . for real fluids",
    "such symmetry is only approximate .",
    "it is well established that the reduced symmetry of fluids leads to scaling field mixing close to the critical point  @xcite .",
    "to linear order in @xmath24 and in @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , the scaling fields have the form @xmath60 @xmath61 where the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 are system - dependent ( non - universal ) quantities controlling the degree of field mixing .",
    "@xmath62 is identified as the limiting critical slope of the coexistence curve , i.e. @xmath64 . in order to account for the asymmetry of a real fluid near its critical point one should identify the bulk field @xmath65 with @xmath66 rather than with @xmath56 in the scaling analysis .",
    "the temperature dependence of the bulk field @xmath29 depends on the particular equation of state .",
    "consider first the the simplest possibility , i.e. the classical equation of state in the critical region given by retaining only the leading terms of the expanded van der waals ( vdw ) equation of state . in terms of reduced temperature @xmath24 and density @xmath67 the vdw equation of state reads @xmath68\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the critical pressure and @xmath71 is the critical volume per molecule .",
    "the leading order behaviour of this equation in the near critical region is @xmath72 where we have ignored terms @xmath73 and @xmath74 and higher .",
    "note that eq.([eq : exvdw ] ) exhibits particle - hole symmetry in that @xmath75 along an isotherm is antisymmetric with respect to the critical isochore @xmath76 moreover , for this case there is no scaling field mixing and @xmath77 whose magnitude _ decreases _ linearly in @xmath24 as @xmath2 is approached at constant @xmath78 .    in order to analyse the influence of a @xmath24-dependent bulk field on the behaviour of the adsorption @xmath52",
    "we reconsider the approximate formula ( [ eq : adsapprox ] ) .",
    "for the expanded vdw equation of state ( [ eq : exvdw ] ) and @xmath79 ( @xmath30 ) eq.([eq : adsapprox ] ) becomes @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and for consistency with the vdw approach the critical exponents should take on their classical values , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and the first ( critical adsorption ) term diverges as -@xmath85 .",
    "apart from the additional temperature independent term , eq.([eq : apadvdw ] ) has the same form as for a constant bulk field ( eq.([eq : adsapprox ] ) ) .",
    "the additional term does not affect the shape of the curve @xmath52 .",
    "it simply shifts @xmath52 as a whole towards negative values and for large widths of the pore @xmath32 and ( or ) relatively large @xmath86 it could drive @xmath1 negative sufficiently far from the critical point ( large @xmath24 ) . closer to @xmath2 the temperature dependent terms dominate and the analysis of @xmath52 as a function of @xmath29 and @xmath32 performed in ref .",
    "@xcite for constant bulk field @xmath29 , goes through with @xmath87 replaced by @xmath88 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we rewrite eq.([eq : apadvdw ] ) in the form @xmath89",
    "-{\\cal a}_4\\mid r\\mid l,\\ ] ] where @xmath90 and we have used the exponent relation  @xcite @xmath91 to introduce the gap exponent @xmath92 .",
    "once again it is understood that the exponents take their classical values . in the region of validity of approximation ( [ eq : adsapprox ] ) , i.e. for @xmath93 , with @xmath94 three different ranges of @xmath95 with qualitatively different behaviours of @xmath96 can be distinguished  @xcite :    1 .",
    "@xmath97 + in this case the first term in square brackets in ( [ adsapprox2 ] ) dominates in the whole region of validity of this approximation since @xmath98 and @xmath99 is negative .",
    "hence , in this region the adsorption should increase monotonically as @xmath35 .",
    "2 .   @xmath100 + this condition is equivalent to @xmath101 . in this case",
    "@xmath102 throughout the critical region and the second term in square brackets in ( [ adsapprox2 ] ) dominates .",
    "hence , the adsorption is negative and _ desorption _ takes place despite the presence of adsorbing walls .",
    "@xmath103 + for a given pore width @xmath32 , the second term in square brackets in ( [ adsapprox2 ] ) dominates so long as @xmath104 and then @xmath52 is negative . as @xmath24 increases , @xmath52 reaches a maximum for @xmath105 . finally for @xmath106 the constant term in square brackets in ( [ adsapprox2 ] ) dominates over the second term , and for such temperatures the usual fisher - de gennes type of adsorption should occur .",
    "we now consider values of parameters appropriate to the experiments of ref .",
    "assume that @xmath107 , is of the size of the nominal pore diameter ( @xmath108 is the molecular size ) of the mesoporous glass used as the adsorbent .",
    "for @xmath109 , corresponding to the two near - critical isochores along which @xmath96 was measured , @xmath110 . for this value of @xmath32 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "then according to the above discussion the adsorption @xmath3 should _ increase monotonically _ as @xmath44 is lowered towards @xmath2 following these two isochores . even for densities that deviate more strongly from @xmath26 , e.g. @xmath113 , @xmath114 and the condition @xmath115 for the occurence of depletion of @xmath3 might still not be satisfied .",
    "it is also very likely that for these values of @xmath78 and @xmath32 the adsorption is positive for @xmath116 and hence for @xmath117 it should saturate at a positive value .",
    "it is important to contrast this constant @xmath78 ( density ) scenario with the constant @xmath29 lattice gas described in ref .",
    "there depletion was observed for fields @xmath29 in the range -@xmath118 to -@xmath119 .",
    "these were sufficiently strong to drive @xmath3 negative for @xmath120 , i.e. while @xmath121 was smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath1 then saturated at a negative value for @xmath122 . in the present case , even for values of @xmath78 as negative as @xmath123",
    ", the effective field might not be strong enough to drive @xmath1 negative before @xmath124 and then @xmath1 would saturate at a positive value .    our analysis",
    "so far has been based on ( [ eq : exvdw ] ) .",
    "consider now equations of state which do not incorporate the symmetry ( [ eq : symm ] ) in the @xmath125 plane .",
    "for systems described by such equations of state the true scaling fields are now @xmath66 and @xmath126 and by analogy with bulk  @xcite the true op @xmath127 which satisfies the scaling relations ( [ eq : scalmagnet ] ) and ( [ eq : scaladsorp ] ) is not @xmath128 but rather the linear combination of the number and entropy densities @xmath129 . the entropy term in the op does not change the leading asymptotic behaviour of the adsorption for the semi - infinite system ; it gives rise to a `` correction term '' to eq.([eq : scaladsorp ] ) of order @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the specific heat critical exponent .",
    "in the scaling analysis of @xmath3 for the confined system , the scaling field @xmath29 should be now replaced by @xmath66 . in order to see if this can change the behaviour of @xmath1 we first consider equations of state that are linear in @xmath24 , as was the case in the vdw equation of state . for all such equations",
    "the mixed scaling field @xmath66 reduces to @xmath65 defined by ( [ eq : transcr ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the chemical potential on the critical isochore and the chemical potential at coexistence have the same limiting slope at @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath132 so that @xmath133 thus , for the classical equations of state which are linear in temperature the reduced symmetry of the fluid does not influence the temperature behaviour of the bulk field .",
    "@xmath134 differs from the leading order behaviour only by terms higher in @xmath78 .",
    "for example , in the case of the vdw equation of state these are of order @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "if the equation of state is not linear in temperature then @xmath137 where @xmath138 is a constant coefficient .",
    "thus , the temperature dependence of the scaled field @xmath66 , which now plays the role of the bulk field @xmath29 , differs from that of @xmath56 , but only by terms higher order in @xmath24 .",
    "we conclude that differences arising from the reduced symmetry of the fluid , i.e. mixed scaling fields , are not important for the behaviour of the adsorption .",
    "the presence of higher order terms in @xmath78 and @xmath24 do not change the conclusions of our analysis performed using ( [ eq : exvdw ] ) .",
    "thus our predictions of no depletion of adsorption along near - critical isochores should be valid for all classical equations of state .",
    "of course real fluids are non - classical .",
    "our argument can be extended using the fact that near criticality real fluids should obey the scaled equation of state  @xcite @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the critical exponent and @xmath141 is an amplitude for the power law on the critical isotherm , and @xmath142 is a scaling function .",
    "note that @xmath143 for @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "although there is no _ a priori _ theoretical expression for @xmath142 the scaling function should satisfy several conditions following from requirements of thermodynamic stability and analyticity of the chemical potential .",
    "thus , @xmath142 should be analytic in its range of definition @xmath146 , equal to 0 at @xmath147 , the coexistence curve , and possess an ( asymptotic ) series expansion near @xmath148 ( the critical isochore ) of the form @xmath149 for small values of @xmath150 , @xmath142 should have an expansion of the form @xmath151 the leading temperature dependence of @xmath56 on the near - critical isochores is given by the first term in expansion ( [ eq : exlarx ] ) and the leading @xmath78 dependence is given by the first term in expansion ( [ eq : exsmx ] ) , i.e. @xmath152 where @xmath141 and @xmath153 are amplitudes .",
    "for classical exponents this expression is consistent with eq.([eq : exvdw ] ) . using this form for the bulk field @xmath154",
    "we can repeat the analysis performed above .",
    "eq.([adsapprox2 ] ) remains valid but now @xmath155 . for real fluids",
    "@xmath156 which means that the values of @xmath157 are even smaller for a given @xmath78 than in the classical case .",
    "this implies that the effective bulk field is very weak for the conditions of the experiment and thus depletion of the adsorption @xmath3 should not occur .",
    "rather saturation of @xmath1 at positive values should be expected .",
    "in this section we report the results of density functional calculations for the adsorption @xmath1 of a near - critical , simple fluid confined in a slit - like pore .",
    "these results provide an explicit test of the heuristic ideas given above .",

    "assuming there exists a regime for which @xmath384 , ( with @xmath108 the particle diameter ) , one expects that @xmath245 will exhibit the universal scaling behaviour of critical adsorption at a single wall , i.e. @xmath385 .",
    "it is not clear , _ a - priori _ , that our rather narrow slit pore provides access to this regime .",
    "nevertheless fig .",
    "[ fig : crit_ad ] demonstrates that a fairly good fit to this form can be achieved in the high temperature regime .",
    "as @xmath311 is reduced towards the intermediate regime , @xmath245 becomes progressively flatter until , for @xmath386 , the adsorption appears to exhibit little or no temperature dependence .",
    "this ` neutral wall ' scenario presumably arises from a ( near ) cancellation of two competing factors associated with the wall potential . on the one hand",
    "there is the ` missing neighbours ' effect ( represented by the parameter @xmath231 in equation  ( [ eq : wallfluid ] ) ) , whereby particles close to the wall have their potential energy raised relative to those in the bulk . on the other hand , there is the reduction in potential energy of particles arising from the attractive part of the wall potential ( cf . the parameter @xmath387 in equation  ( [ eq : wallfluid ] ) ) .",
    "the cancellation of these two contributions effectively neutralises the influence of the wall on the fluid , and with it the temperature dependence of @xmath270 .",
    "this is also clearly visible in the corresponding density profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : neutral ] ) .",
    "turning finally to small @xmath311 values , we find that the adsorption is negative at the critical point , reflecting the fact ( cf .",
    "[ fig : critprofs ] ) that @xmath388 for all @xmath19 .",
    "as @xmath24 increases , however , @xmath245 is observed to increase monotonically with increasing @xmath24 , although it at no point becomes positive .",
    "this increase in @xmath270 is traceable to a progressive relaxation ( away from the walls ) of @xmath363 towards the bulk value @xmath322 . as in the case of large @xmath311 discussed above , this effect has its origin in the decrease of the correlation length .      in the experiments of refs",
    "@xcite , the adsorption was studied on sub - critical isochores having @xmath389 .",
    "unfortunately , in a simulation , it is not practicable to employ these same isochores because of the wholesale smearing - out of the critical region by finite - size effects",
    ". specifically , in the fss regime , one finds @xcite that @xmath390 , where @xmath391 is some scaling function . in practical terms",
    ", this means that applying a given non - zero bulk field to the fluid engenders a much smaller density change for a finite - size system than in the bulk limit . as a corollary",
    ", one finds that the typical scale of density fluctuations in a critical finite - sized system can be large .",
    "thus for instance , for a cubic simulation cell of size @xmath346 , the critical point density fluctuations extend from @xmath392 to @xmath393 .",
    "clearly therefore a fractional reduction in the density of @xmath394 would have little discernible effect , either on bulk finite - size or adsorption phenomena .    in view of this",
    ", we have chosen to study @xmath245 on the isochore having @xmath395 .",
    "although this density is considerably smaller than @xmath322 , it nevertheless lies within the range of critical point density fluctuations in our finite - sized systems .",
    "one can therefore anticipate that if there is a critical depletion effect associated with negative values of the bulk field , then it should be visible on this isochore .",
    "the locus of the @xmath396 isochore was determined in the temperature range @xmath352 using the same procedures as outlined in section  [ sec : crit_iso ] . however , an additional complication in the present case was a greatly increased finite - size dependence of @xmath397 .",
    "comparison of @xmath397 for @xmath353 and @xmath346 revealed finite - size effects an order of magnitude larger than those on the critical isochore ( cf .",
    "inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : isochore ] ) .",
    "this feature was discussed in section  [ sec : crit_iso ] and is traceable to the differing magnitudes of the bulk field @xmath66 on each isochore . to ameliorate the problem , we determined @xmath398 using a very large cubic system of linear size @xmath399 .",
    "comparison of the results from @xmath399 with those from a system of size @xmath346 showed a discrepancy of less than two parts in @xmath354 .",
    "the form of @xmath245 for the @xmath317-@xmath318 potential on the @xmath396 isochore is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_sc ] .",
    "data is shown for the same selection of @xmath311 values given in fig .",
    "[ fig : crit_ad ] . comparing these two figures ,",
    "it is clear that the application of the negative bulk field reduces the adsorption to a considerably greater degree at large @xmath24 than at small @xmath24 .",
    "we attribute this to the large correlation length for small @xmath24 , allowing the effect of the wall density ( which is effectively pinned by the choice of @xmath311 ) to propagate across the slit , despite the action of the negative bulk field .",
    "the net effect is to increase the range of variation of @xmath245 for large @xmath311 values but to reduce it for small @xmath311 values .",
    "the same qualitative behaviour is observed for the @xmath319-@xmath320 wall potential .",
    "however , in no instance do we see any sign of a rapid critical depletion of the pore density as @xmath35 .",
    "the density functional ( dft ) results and those of simulation have confirmed the heuristic arguments of section ii that there should be no critical depletion for a fluid in a single slit pore . in particular , for a fluid on its critical isochore , @xmath48 , and for strongly attractive walls the adsorption @xmath270 increases monotonically as @xmath44 is reduced towards @xmath2 .",
    "there is no evidence of the rapid decrease of @xmath270 near @xmath2 which is the experimentally observed signature of critical depletion . although the simulation results , fig.8 , do not display the saturation of @xmath270 that is clear in dft results of fig.2 we believe this reflects the different values of @xmath32 and the different temperature ranges used in the two treatments . in the dft calculations , where @xmath32 is very large , saturation does not set in until @xmath400 and @xmath270 is still decreasing quite rapidly with @xmath24 for @xmath401 . in the simulations , however , where @xmath402 we would not expect saturation until @xmath403 and this is difficult to discern on the scale of fig.8",
    ". such monotonic behaviour of @xmath270 is consistent with the lattice gas results for bulk field @xmath49",
    "it differs from the monte carlo results of schoen et.al .",
    "@xcite but , as mentioned earlier , those simulations suffered from systematic errors  @xcite .",
    "the physical picture which emerges from both our present treatments is one in which the density profiles show increasing enhancement , with respect to @xmath26 , in the central portion of the slit as the correlation length @xmath121 increases and the decay at each wall becomes slower . when @xmath404 , i.e. @xmath124 , there is maximum enhancement and maximum adsorption .",
    "increasing the strength of the wall - fluid potential ( the parameter @xmath311 ) simply raises the overall level of the profiles and leads to an increase in @xmath270 at a given value of @xmath405 - see fig.8 .    for weakly attractive walls ( small values of @xmath311 ) the simulation results yield negative values of the adsorption on the critical isochore , with @xmath245 monotonically increasing with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "in this regime of @xmath311 the wall - liquid interface would be dry for @xmath177 , i.e. the walls prefer gas to liquid . at supercritical temperatures the density near the wall is lower than @xmath26 and the profile increases towards the centre of the slit .",
    "the closer one is to @xmath2 the slower is the increase and the more negative is @xmath270 .",
    "similar behaviour of @xmath270 is found for very weakly attractive walls ( small @xmath387 ) in our dft calculations and was noticed earlier by marini bettolo marconi  @xcite . by selecting an intermediate value of @xmath311 it is possible to construct a nearly neutral wall for which @xmath52 is small in magnitude and almost independent of @xmath24 . in this case",
    "the density profiles are remarkably insensitive to @xmath405 until very close to @xmath2 where @xmath10 has the striking form shown in fig.9 , i.e. it becomes concave upwards with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "more careful analysis reveals that for slightly greater values of @xmath311 the profiles exhibit two symmetric maxima near the walls ( but outside the regions of the oscillatory structure ) for temperatures close to @xmath2 .",
    "similar , non - monotonic profiles were found recently for two - dimensional critical ising films in the crossover regime between ordinary and normal transitions , i.e. for weak surface fields  @xcite .",
    "currently we are investigating whether the non - monotonic form of the profiles found in the present simulations of a lennard - jones fluid arises from the same physical mechanism as in the ising case .",
    "we were motivated to investigate sub - critical isochores because i ) the sorption experiments on porous glasses were performed for @xmath406 and @xmath407 and ii ) the lattice gas studies of ref.@xcite suggested that depletion should occur on a path at fixed bulk field @xmath408 .",
    "our present results for fluids show that no depletion occurs for the wide range of sub - critical isochores and pore - widths which we have investigated .",
    "the dft results of fig.2 imply that for the values of @xmath78 pertaining to the experiments the behaviour of @xmath245 is changed very little from that on the critical isochore @xmath409 .",
    "increasing @xmath410 does alter @xmath245 but this quantity remains monotonically increasing as @xmath411 .",
    "this is in keeping with the simulation results ( with large @xmath311 ) of fig .",
    "10 , although it should be noted that the simulations refer to @xmath412 and to a much smaller value of @xmath32 than in the dft calculations or in the experiments . in summary , our explicit calculations appear to confirm the expectations of section ii that , for strongly attractive walls and parameter values of practical interest , the effective bulk field in the fluid is insufficient to drive @xmath270 negative before @xmath124 , i.e. we are in the regime @xmath413 where depletion does not occur .",
    "alternatively one can say that for the relevant values of @xmath78 , the experimental pore widths @xmath32 are not large enough for the density profile to relax from its high value near the walls to its bulk sub - critical value in the centre .",
    "note that one can not make @xmath86 too large or one leaves the experimental critical region .",
    "the circumstances of the fluid are different from those of the lattice gas , where for reasonable choices of fixed bulk field @xmath29 one has  @xcite @xmath414 , the parameter equivalent to @xmath415 .",
    "we conclude that the adsorption calculated along critical and sub - critical isochores for a single slit pore does not exhibit the depletion observed in the experiments . what then can be the explanation of the experimental data ?",
    "one might speculate that for some reason the density of the reference cell , which fixes the experimental isochore , was not constant but it is still difficult to see why this might mimic the fixed @xmath29 scenario .",
    "what is more likely is that the observed depletion arises from the fact that the porous adsorbent is a complex solid material consisting of interconnected pores of various shapes and sizes whose morphology is poorly understood .",
    "modelling such a material in terms of ideal ( non - connected ) slit pores is , of course , a gross over simplification .",
    "recent theoretical and simulation studies  @xcite show that the phase behaviour of fluids confined in such disordered media _ can be _ very different from that which occurs in a single pore but we are not aware of investigations of the adsorption along near - critical isochores",
    ". it should be possible to employ the model porous glasses produced in the quench simulations of gelb and gubbins  @xcite , which mimic the spinodal decomposition process used to make real cpg glasses , in such an investigation .",
    "were the adsorption to be vastly different from that found for the average single pore this would be a striking demonstration of the importance of pore disorder and connectivity for critical phenomena . note that further evidence that the single pore model is inappropriate to describe the experiments comes from the observation that critical depletion occurs for the colloidal graphite substrate vulcan 3@xmath23 for @xmath416 and @xmath417 i.e. for super - critical isochores  @xcite .",
