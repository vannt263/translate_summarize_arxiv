    "yield - stress fluids exhibit a distinct type of non - newtonian behavior : they are effectively fluid at high stress and solid at low stress . when droplets of yield - stress fluids impact pre - coated surfaces , they exhibit splashing behavior that is not observed in impacts onto dry surfaces .",
    "we use droplets of an aqueous solution of carbopol 940 ( a shear - reversible physical gel with 0.1 - 1.0wt% additive ) .",
    "we explore how the characteristics of these impacts vary as a function of three input parameters .",
    "first , we vary the material properties by changing the concentration of the additive , including newtonian droplets for comparison ( water and glycerol ) .",
    "we then vary the droplet size and the impact velocity . in all three cases , we observe that the non - newtonian behavior of the gel dominates the impact dynamics where stresses and shear rates are low , either locally or globally .",
    "this is most clearly demonstrated by the transition from the newtonian - like behavior of splashing ( at low concentration , large size , or high velocity ) to the yield stress behavior of sticking ( at high concentration , small size , or low velocity ) .",
    "each splash - to - stick transition shows impact characteristics of yield - stress fluids that are not observed in newtonian droplets , including unique angles and curvatures in the ejection sheets , halted motion of the sheet contact line , thread - like ejected droplets , and contoured final surfaces ."
