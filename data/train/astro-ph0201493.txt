    "the first attempt to model the icm in the framework of the hierarchical scenario assumed its thermodynamical properties to be entirely determined by gravitational processes , like adiabatic compression during collapse and shock heating ( kaiser 1986 ) . if no characteristic scales are present in the underlying cosmology ( i.e. , einstein  de - sitter cosmology and power  law shape for the power spectrum of density perturbations ) , this model should predict hot gas within rich clusters to look the same as within poor groups , since gravity in itself does not have characteristic scales . under the assumptions of emissivity dominated by free  free bremsstrahlung and of hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas , this model predicts @xmath1 for the shape and evolution of the relation between @xmath2ray luminosity and icm temperature ( also eke , navarro & frenk 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , if we define the gas entropy as @xmath3 ( @xmath4 : electron number density ; e.g. , eke et al .",
    "1998 ) , then the self ",
    "similar icm has @xmath5 .",
    "however , soon the simple model described above failed to account for several new observational facts : ( a ) the @xmath6@xmath7 relation for nearby clusters is steeper than predicted , with @xmath8 for @xmath9 kev clusters ( e.g. , david et al . 1993 ; white , jones & forman 1997 ; allen & fabian 1998 ; markevitch 1998 ) ; with a possible further steepening at the group scale , @xmath10 kev ( ponman et al .",
    "1996 ; helsdon & ponman 2000 ) ; ( b ) no evidence of evolution for its amplitude has been detected out to @xmath11 ( e.g. , fairley et al . 2000 ; della ceca et al .",
    "2001 ; borgani et al .",
    "2001a ) ; ( c ) the gas density profiles in central regions of cooler groups is relatively softer than for hotter cluster and , correspondingly , the entropy is higher ( e.g. , ponman , cannon & navarro 1999 ; lloyd  davis et al .",
    "observational evidence provides a fairly robust measure of the entropy floor for the diffuse hot gas in groups ( lloyd  davis et al .",
    "2000 ) of 100 kev/@xmath0 .",
    "a related , very important measurement is the fraction of baryons that has been converted into a `` cold '' , non x  ray emitting phase ( i.e stars and neutral hydrogen ) .",
    "this constraint is crucial as it defines the amount of energy available from sne and the importance of cooling in groups and clusters ( renzini 2000 ) .",
    "balogh et al . ( 2001 ) estimate that only a small fraction ( 510% ) of baryons has been converted into stars , almost independently of the total virial mass of the cluster .",
    "@xmath12 _ gas cooling_. at the center of groups the cooling time is much shorter than a hubble time .",
    "cooling would remove low entropy gas transforming it into stars and possibly originate the entropy floor observed .",
    "while advocated on the ground of its simplicity ( muanwong et al 2001 also voit & bryan 2001 ) , the amount of gas involved can not exceed the observed fraction of 515% of the total baryon fraction .",
    "@xmath12 _ energy injection from agns _ ( e.g bhringer , this proceedings ) would be an important source of heating .",
    "most of the energy would come from jets that would carve `` bubbles '' in the icm ( mc namara et al 2001 , quilis et al .",
    "2001 ) , while the x - ray emission from the central engine in radio quiet qsos would likely have a small effect due to the small cross section for the process .",
    "@xmath12 _ energy injection from sne_. winds propelled by sne explosions ( an hefty 10@xmath13erg / sn ) would transfer heat to the icm , possibly escaping the halos of individual galaxies in the forming protocluster and enrich the icm with metals .",
    "( note : substantial metal enrichment could originate also from ram pressure and tidal stripping of galaxies ( moore , quilis & bower 2001 ) .",
    "@xmath12 _ analytical methods _ allow a fast exploration of parameter space , but must sometimes rely on the parametrization of the end results of complicated physical processes . while this approach requires studying the physics of gas in a somewhat idealized situation ( spherical collapse , accretion from a uniform background ) the amount of insight gained is impressive , although conclusions sometimes differ widely ( kaiser 1991,valageas & silk 1999 , tozzi & norman 2000 , bryan 2000 , balogh , babul & patton 1999 , among many ) .",
    "the most refined methods are based on the standard machinery developed to link gravitational clustering in cold dark matter models and the physics of gas and star formation ( cole et al .",
    "2000 , somerville & primack 1999 , bower et al .",
    "2001 , menci & cavaliere 2000 , cavaliere , giacconi & menci 2000 ) .",
    "@xmath12_n - body simulations _ are a powerful method , able to treat the highly non  linear problem of the formation of cosmic structures with very few assumptions .",
    "recent observational evidence for a mono phase icm ( bhringer et al 2001 ) remove some potential worries about the use of sph methods , which do not describe well a multiphase medium .",
    "some recent works on the l ",
    "t relation including feedback and star formation ( metzler & evrard 1994 , bialek , evrard & mohr 2001 , borgani et al 2001b , valdarnini 2001 ) provide a good starting point and an extensive list of references to the subject of simulations of galaxy clusters .",
    "as mentioned above , several papers suggested that simply the addition of cooling would remove enough gas from the icm to reconcile models with the observed l  t relation .",
    "this would likely be in contrast with observational evidence that points to a limited fraction of baryons in clusters in a `` cold '' non x  ray emitting phase",
    ". moreover it would be difficult to hide the large quantity of cooled gas in `` dark baryons '' as they would cause detectable deepening of the central potential well at the center of clusters ( e.g lewis et al . 1999 , valdarnini 2001 ) .",
    "this would have a substantial effect on the predicted m ",
    "t relation increasing the emission weighted temperature of groups ( finoguenov et al 2001 ) . on the other hand",
    "recent theoretical works , both analytical and numerical seem to ( perhaps slowly ) converge to a required energy input comparable to 100% of what is available from sne ( kravtsov & yepes 2000 , bower et al 2001 , or even a few times higher ( borgani et al . 2001b , valageas & silk 1999 , wu , fabian & nulsen 2000 ) to satisfy the l  t relation .",
    "while semi - analytical models estimate the energy available from sne to be of the order of @xmath14 0.25 kev per particle , renzini ( 2000 ) suggested an even smaller energy budget available from sne : just 0.1 kev .",
    "taken together these works suggest that the required energy must be provided by both sne and agns , perhaps active as major mergers shape the early type population of cluster galaxies .",
    "unfortunately none of the n  body simulations cited above ( some analytical works did ) treated _ both _ cooling and heating in a fully consistent way or included the effect of agns on the icm .",
    "this leaves the quantitative contribution of cooling and heating rather uncertain .",
    "not really . as the entropy s depends on a inverse power of @xmath15 it might seem more efficient to heat the icm at lower z ( say z@xmath16 ) as suggested in tozzi & norman ( 1999 ) .",
    "however , in their model the authors heated the gas _ before _ accretion , while at the background density . in a more realistic case gas",
    "will be heated when already inside halos that will later merge to form the cluster .",
    "while this requires more energy for a given entropy s , ( @xmath15 is higher by a factor @xmath17 ) this is more than compensated by the fact that halos collapsed at high z will form the core of the cluster at lower z ( governato et al .",
    "2001 ) , i.e. you dump energy right where it is needed .",
    "borgani et al ( 2001b , 2001c ) and bialek , evrard & mohr ( 2000 ) tried a large range of z ( 1 to 5 and 20 respectively ) finding a weak dependence on results for the argument given above .",
    "of course , a redshift too close to z @xmath181 for heating would cause the l  t to evolve significantly at moderate redshift , contrary to observations .",
    "bottom line : it is very likely that a combination of cooling & feedback will give the correct , non  evolving l ",
    "t relation , although only stronger observational constraints and more refined simulations will allow us to evaluate the _ quantitative _ role of cooling , sne and agns .",
    "numerical simulations including a treatment of hydrodynamical processes have reached a high degree of maturity , with widely different codes giving comparable results ( frenk et al 1999 ) . however , the number of particles used to simulate _ individual _ halos is still systematically lower than in dm only runs ( e.g ghigna et al .",
    "the hot debate on the shape of inner density profiles in dm halos has started a race to higher resolution runs ( governato , ghigna & moore 2001 ) . while the quest for the ultimate density profile of dm halos might ultimately prove futile it has sparked a number of improvements on codes and , equally important , increased the robustness of results .",
    "a key method is the so called `` renormalization technique '' ( katz & white 1993 ) where a halo taken from a cosmological simulation is resimulated at much higher resolution , while sparsely resampling the surrounding region .",
    "fig.1 shows the crucial effect of increasing resolution on a sample of sph simulations of renormalized halos .",
    "( borgani et al 2001b , c ) .",
    "t relation obtained from simulations of large cosmological volumes ( where particle number and the ratio softening / r@xmath19 for each halo depends on its virial mass ) likely suffer of systematic biases due to the worsening resolution for less massive halos : namely smaller l@xmath20 and slower cooling due to lower central densities .",
    "0.3truecm this is my very personal wish list for future theoretical and observational studies on the subject : 0.2truecm    @xmath12 estimates of l@xmath21 and t in groups that exclude contamination from agns .",
    "@xmath12 estimates of the amount of metals in clusters to a significant fraction of r@xmath19 as another method to infer the energy release from sne ( renzini 2000 , de grandi & molendi 2001 ) .",
    "@xmath12 a robust estimate of the fraction of `` cold '' baryons which keeps into account the amount of intracluster stars .",
    "recent claims ( see arnaboldi et al 2001 ) based on intracluster pns almost double the the efficiency of star formation in clusters .",
    "@xmath12 simulations of sufficient resolution to treat cooling and star formation processes in a robust way .",
