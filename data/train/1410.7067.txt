    "for a long time , the study of quantum entanglement was only of foundational interest and the researchers were mainly addressing the questions that were related with the quantum mechanical understanding of various fundamental notions like reality and locality  @xcite .",
    "however , for the last two decades we have seen that quantum entanglement is also a reality as far as the laboratory preparation of entangled qubits is concerned  @xcite .",
    "the research that was conducted during this period was not concerned about the existence of entangled qubits , but mostly about its usefulness as a resource to carry out information processing protocols like quantum teleportation  @xcite , cryptography  @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , remote state preparation @xcite , broadcasting of entanglement@xcite , quantum state merging @xcite etc . + it is fairly easy to quantify the amount of quantum correlation present in a pure bipartite system .",
    "this is quantified by the amount of entanglement present in the system .",
    "there are certain standard measures , more specifically entanglement monotones like negativity @xcite and concurrence @xcite , quantifying the amount of entanglement for both pure as well as for mixed states .",
    "however , there are certain open issues in understanding the nature of correlations present in a mixed state , or a multi - qubit state . in addition",
    ", it is also not totally evident whether all the information - processing tasks that can be done more efficiently with quantum systems require entanglement as resource .",
    "there are several instances where even in the absence or near absence of entanglement one can carry out some information - processing tasks more efficiently @xcite .",
    "a natural question to ask is if not entanglement , then what is responsible for such behavior .",
    "researchers argued that the amount of correlation present in the composite system is not entirely captured by entanglement .",
    "they came up with different quantities for capturing the quantum correlation@xcite .",
    "one such measure based on information theoretic approach to quantify correlation is quantum discord @xcite .",
    "this aims to capture the non classical correlations present in a system , and more specifically that part of the correlation that can not be witnessed with the standard measures of entanglement .",
    "these new measures are also extended for many qubit systems by adopting different approaches @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have geometric measures @xcite to quantify the correlation in quantum mechanical systems . +",
    "a very important information processing task is quantum state merging @xcite . in the classical",
    "setting state merging refers to the following scenario . consider two parties alice and bob who wish to carry out some protocol .",
    "bob has some prior information @xmath0 and the other party alice has some missing information @xmath1 ( where @xmath1 and @xmath0 are random variables ) .",
    "here one asks a very simple question : if bob wants to learn about @xmath1 , how much additional information alice needs to send him .",
    "it has been shown that only @xmath2 bits of information will suffice @xcite .",
    "this quantity is known as the conditional entropy of @xmath1 given that @xmath0 has occurred .",
    "this partial information that alice needs to send to bob is always a positive quantity , since classical information is always positive . in the context of quantum information , alice and",
    "bob each possess a system in some unknown quantum state with the total density operator being @xmath3 .",
    "the interesting case is where bob is correlated with alice , so that he has some prior information about her state .",
    "we ask how much additional quantum information alice needs to send him , so that he has the full state . the amount of partial quantum information that alice needs to send bob is given by the quantum conditional entropy , which is exactly the same quantity as in the classical case but with the shannon entropy replaced by the von neumann entropy : @xmath4 .",
    "the notion of state - merging was extended to n - parties by dutil and hayden  @xcite . in another work",
    ", authors have given an operational interpretation of quantum discord based on the quantum state merging protocol  @xcite .",
    "quantum discord was shown as the markup in the cost of quantum communication in the process of quantum state merging , if one discards relevant prior information .",
    "+ in this work , we revisit the notion of `` quantum dissension '' which happens to be a multipartite extension of quantum discord .",
    "we introduce a new expression of quantum dissension called residual correlation .",
    "the basic motivation of introducing this quantity is to quantify the amount of extra correlation generated by doing two particle projective measurement instead of doing one particle projective measurement . in a sense",
    "it quantifies the residual or leftover part of correlation generated by a two particle measurement which is not captured by single particle measurement .",
    "in addition , we also give an operational interpretation of residual correlation in terms of state merging .",
    "we show that the total change in the cost of state merging is bounded by this residual correlation . +",
    "the notion of quantum discord @xcite has been generalized to three parties from different perspectives @xcite .",
    "one such way of extending quantum discord depending on the nature of projective measurement is called `` quantum dissension '' @xcite .",
    "these are obtained by taking the difference of different expressions for mutual information that are not equivalent in quantum domain .",
    "the difference of these three definitions can capture various aspects of the quantum correlations .",
    "let us consider a three - qubit state @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 refer to first , second and third qubit respectively.the initial quantum mutual information @xmath9 when no measurement is carried out is given by @xmath10+s(\\rho_{abc}),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 quantifies the von neumann entropy of the state @xmath12 .",

    "it is interesting to note that because in principle there can be various expressions of mutual informations classically , we will have various definitions of quantum dissension .",
    "all these definitions capture various aspects of quantum correlation in the multiparty setting .",

    "mathematically , this is @xmath39 .",
    "we call the quantity @xmath40 as residual correlation .",

    "+    first of all we find out what will be the change in the cost of state merging if we discard a quantum system through a measurement process .",

    "we have @xmath66 as @xmath63 starts with product state with @xmath67 .",
    "we also have @xmath68 as there is no change in the total correlation of the system as result of unitary interaction .",

    "in other words in terms of conditional entropy we can say at most , @xmath70 .",

    "the state of @xmath5 after measurement on the sub system @xmath7 changes to @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 is the projection operator ) .",

    "we bring in an ancilla @xmath63 which is initially in a pure state @xmath64 ( see fig  [ fig:4 ] ) . here",
    "@xmath65 once again is the unitary interaction between @xmath79 and @xmath63 . since @xmath63 is in a complete product state with the rest of the system , it does not contribute to the entropy of the system .",

    "equivalently , we can write @xmath83 .",
    "hence , the change in the cost of state merging @xmath84 is a positive quantity . in other words , discarding prior information increases the cost of state merging .",
    "similarly , the state of @xmath5 after measurement on the subsystem @xmath31 changes to @xmath85 ( where @xmath75 are two particle projection operators ) . hence @xmath86 and and @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath78{step3.jpg}\\ ] ]    therefore , the total change in the cost of state merging after carrying out both types measurement is the sumtotal of the change in the cost in each of these individual measurements .",
    "this total change in the cost is given by , @xmath88 .",
    "next we relate this total change in the cost of state merging in terms of the residual correlation .",

    ", we have @xmath90 . since @xmath93 , we have @xmath92 .",
    "this is indeed a remarkable feature as the total change in the cost of state merging is captured by the residual correlation present in the system . in fig  [ fig:5 ]",
    "we have plotted the total change of the cost of state merging ( the residual correlation function ) with respect to the mixedness of the system ( which is given by @xmath94 ) and found that this quantity in principle can take positive , negative and zero values . for states with positive residual correlation",
    "there is increase in the cost of state merging . for states with zero residual correlation",
    ", there is no increase in the cost of state merging .",
    "negative residual correlation indicates that there has been a decrease in the cost of state merging .",
    "this result shows that for certain quantum states by discarding relevant prior information we can bring down the cost of state merging .",
