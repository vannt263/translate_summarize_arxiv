    "the theory of the scattering of massless and massive particles with different spins off black holes has a long history in gravity and quantum gravity @xcite . over the years the topic attracted much attention and led to the discovery of new phenomena like glory scattering @xcite , superradiant scattering and black hole bomb @xcite .",
    "a related subject is the modes of perturbation of black holes ( characteristic sound of a black hole ) , the so - called quasi normal modes ( qnms ) @xcite , which can be also extracted from the corresponding scattering @xmath0-matrix where they appear as complex poles ( resonances ) .",
    "the relevance of qnms for the quantum gravity lies , e.g. , in a method to quantize the area ( and therefore also the entropy ) of a black hole .",
    "however , the ramification of the @xmath0-matrix poles goes beyond the qnms as modes of perturbation .",
    "the poles normally harbour all the information about the existence of stable bound states , quasi - bound states and resonances @xcite .",
    "for instance , the absence of a stable bound state of a particle in a black hole metric @xcite must get reflected in the properties of the poles of the @xmath0-matrix which in such a case should always have a non - zero imaginary part . for massless fields the scattering amplitude has , in addition , a cut in the complex frequency plane beginning from the zero frequency .",
    "the lack of bound state of a spin-@xmath1 particle in certain black hole spacetimes @xcite indicates a non - local quantum effect in semi - classical black hole physics since the classical picture yields a stable orbit .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that different mathematical methods have been applied to the theory of black hole scattering to probe into the semi - classical aspects of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "recently a suggestion to extract qnms from the born approximation to the scattering amplitude was made in @xcite with apparently reasonable results for the imaginary part of the qnms .",
    "it is often tempting to use such simplified approximations to obtain analytical results . in @xcite it was shown that the extraction of qnms from the born amplitude for the schwarzschild and schwarzschild de sitter case is mathematically not well founded . in the second reference in @xcite , a regularization method to evaluate the otherwise divergent integral was suggested .",
    "however , the fact remains that the born integral simply does not exist for a certain range of the energy parameter and it does not make sense to insist on extracting poles from such an integral . here we will demonstrate that this feature is more general and that the born integrals for all interesting spacetimes , including reissner - nordstrm and reissner - nordstrm de sitter exist only within a restricted validity range of the energy @xmath2 which lies outside the range of the extracted values of the qnms .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation that there are no @xmath0-matrix poles in the born approximation of the feynman - dyson perturbative expansion . in an attempt to remedy this problem",
    ", we prove that the large imaginary parts of the qnms can be obtained in a mathematically rigorous way through the coulomb - like scattering phase .",
    "secondly , it appears timely to make an explicit check of the limitations of the born approximation in the physical region of the phase space , i.e. , its usefulness to describe correctly the scattering process .",
    "some work in this direction has been already done in @xcite . however , either the distorted wave born approximation is used @xcite or the comparison with the born approximation is done for low frequencies and in terms of the differential cross section @xmath3 paying attention to the comparison using scattering angles . we perform a test of the validity of the born approximation for different @xmath4 and in the case of the scattering of massless fields with spin @xmath5=0 , 1 , 2 . there",
    "also exists an ambiguity in the scattering phase shift in the born approximation which appears in literature @xcite .",
    "hence there arises a general question whether it is reasonable to apply the born approximation for the scattering off black holes .",
    "we therefore make a comparison between exact albeit numerical results obtained via a riccati equation for the reflection coefficient @xmath6 ( in the context of a one dimensional tunneling problem into which we can map the scattering problem ) and the born approximation .",
    "the comparison shows that only for the spin @xmath7 case and the @xmath8 partial wave , the agreement between the exact result and the born approximation is reasonable over a wide range of @xmath9 . for spins , @xmath10",
    ", there is no agreement for any @xmath4 .",
    "it is well known from general scattering theory @xcite that the born approximation might work at high energies @xcite . however",
    ", if the required energies are so high that the reflection coefficient goes to zero , the comparison might lose any physical meaning .",
    "there exist circumstances where the born approximation is expected to be bad and then again circumstances where it is valid for some particular angular momentum @xmath4 provided we mean the born approximation for a partial wave @xcite .",
    "this is what happens at least in the case of @xmath11 .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly outline the formalism in section two .",
    "section three is about the possibility to extract the qnms from the born amplitude . in section four",
    "we obtain an alternative way to obtain the qnms . in section five",
    "we compare the exact scattering amplitude results with those in the born approximation . in section six",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider the propagation of a massless scalar field @xmath12 governed by the wave equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes a static , spherically symmetric black hole metric whose line element is @xmath15 taking into account that the eigenvalues of the spherical laplacian are @xmath16 the wave equation can be separated by means of the ansatz @xmath17 giving rise to the schrdinger - like equation for the radial part @xmath18\\psi_{n \\ell \\omega } = \\omega^2\\psi_{n \\ell \\omega } , \\ ] ] where @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 having a different form for the various metrics considered in the next section ) and @xmath21 here , a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath22 whereas @xmath23 is a tortoise coordinate defined through @xmath24 we recall that for static , spherically symmetric black hole metrics which are asymptotically flat at spatial infinity the quasinormal modes boundary condition requires that there is a purely ingoing plane wave at the event horizon @xmath25 and a purely outgoing plane wave at space - like infinity , i.e. @xmath26 whereas for black hole metrics which are asymptotically de sitter at spatial infinity the appropriate boundary condition for analyzing quasinormal modes is that the wave function should be outgoing at the cosmological horizon @xmath27 but vanishing at the origin @xcite @xmath28 quasinormal modes can be found by computing the poles of the scattering amplitude @xmath29 . to see that we write the boundary condition at @xmath30 or @xmath31 in the form @xmath32 where @xmath29 is a component of the scattering matrix @xmath33 .",
    "hence imposing @xmath34 is equivalent to looking for a subset of @xmath0-matrix poles . since the problem of black hole scattering",
    "is mapped into one dimension it makes sense to make some identifications .",
    "the one dimensional problem is equivalent to a quantum mechanical tunneling problem such that the reflection amplitude @xmath35 is simply identical to @xmath29 . in one dimension ( 1d )",
    "@xmath29 is thus identified with the scattering amplitude @xmath36 via @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "this is different from the identification in three dimensions ( 3d ) where @xmath38 . in literature , while evaluating cross sections , considering the asymptotic behaviour of the wave function in the 3d radial coordinate @xmath22 , generally @xmath35 is identified with @xmath39 @xcite where @xmath40 is the scattering phase shift .",
    "the reflection and transmission in 1d can be identified as two channels in a scattering problem such that the @xmath35 and @xmath41 enter the elastic and absorption cross sections respectively .",
    "the unitarity of the @xmath0-matrix , @xmath42 , is then given by @xmath43 .",
    "we shall discuss this in more detail in section iv . in one dimension",
    "the born approximation for the scattering amplitude is given by @xcite @xmath44 in particular , for static , spherically symmetric black hole metrics which are asymptotically flat , the scattering amplitude reads @xmath45 whereas for those black hole backgrounds going over asymptotically at spatial infinity to a de sitter geometry we have @xmath46    some comments are now in order .",
    "a first remark refers to the nature of the two channel process which indicates that the phase shift @xmath40 can not be real in general .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the inelasticity factor .",
    "if the reflection amplitude is identified with @xmath29 , any usage of an approximation where the phase shift comes out real necessarily neglects the transmission .",
    "for instance , this applies to a formula like eq .",
    "( 35 ) for the born phase shift mentioned in @xcite .",
    "a second remark concerns the difference between the born approximation in one and three dimensions . in three dimensions with a potential depending only on @xmath22 , the born integral @xmath49 is equal to @xmath50 and is hence real .",
    "the born amplitude in ( [ born1d ] ) is complex for a real @xmath51 .",
    "this implies that the conclusion that the phase shift in the born approximation must be small @xcite is not stringent here .",
    "in this section we discuss the schwarzschild and schwarzschild - de sitter cases briefly and concentrate on the existence of quasinormal modes ( qnms ) in the reissner - nordstrm and reissner - nordstrm - de sitter cases applying the born approximation .      in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that the born integrals have a certain range of validity for the above mentioned metrics .",
    "indeed , for the schwarzschild case , the born integral is restricted to the following range : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the imaginary part of the quasinormal mode frequency @xmath54 , with the real part @xmath55 .",
    "the born integral in this case is a linear combination of products of the gamma function and whittaker function @xcite .",
    "the latter possess the following poles : @xmath56 which , however , in view of the restrictions on the born integral can not be interpreted as quasinormal modes .",
    "the schwarzschild - de sitter case is similar and we refer the reader to @xcite for further details .      in this case @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the mass and charge of the black hole respectively .",
    "we shall analyze the scattering amplitude both for the non extreme @xmath60 and extreme case @xmath61 . in the non extreme case the black hole possesses two distinct horizons at @xmath62",
    "whose surface gravity is given by the simple formula @xmath63 notice that since @xmath64 , @xmath65 will always be greater than @xmath66 .",
    "the scattering amplitude is represented by the integral @xmath67 taking into account that we are interested in the region @xmath68 the tortoise coordinate @xmath23 will be given by the following expression @xcite @xmath69 in view of the above relation it is not difficult to see that we have to evaluate integrals of the form @xmath70 by means of the substitution @xmath71 the above integral becomes up to a constant multiplicative factor @xmath72 taking into account that @xmath73 the integral @xmath74 will exist if the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency is restricted to the following range @xmath75 let @xmath76 . unfortunately the above integral can not be computed in closed form .",
    "however , it takes a dominant contribution close to the event horizon @xmath77 .",
    "hence , we shall consider the integral @xmath78 from this result we immediately see that the imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes will be given by @xmath79 however , these values should be disregarded in view of the condition ( [ conditio - rn ] ) . in the extreme case",
    "@xmath80 the event and cauchy horizon coalesce into a single horizon at @xmath81 .",
    "then , the spatial function @xmath20 can be rewritten as @xmath82 , whereas the tortoise coordinate is given by @xmath83,\\quad \\rho=\\frac{r}{m}.\\ ] ] by means of the above relation and the transformation @xmath84 the scattering amplitude can be written as @xmath85x^{2i\\omega}e^{i\\omega\\left(x-\\frac{1}{x}\\right)},\\ ] ] where @xmath86 .",
    "essentially we have to solve integrals of the form @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath89 the integral @xmath74 has a chance to exist only if @xmath90 .",
    "let @xmath90 in ( [ integralozzo ] ) . since the corresponding integral can not be computed in closed form , we shall consider only the dominant contribution close to the event horizon @xmath77 .",
    "hence , we obtain @xcite @xmath91 from this result we immediately see that the poles of the gamma function should occur at the complex values @xmath92 which is impossible . in this case too , the born approach is inconclusive for the determination of the poles of the scattering amplitude .      in the present case @xmath93 where the constants @xmath94 , @xmath95 are",
    "the mass and electric charge of the black hole and @xmath96 is the cosmological constant . in general , the equation @xmath97 has four different roots : a negative root @xmath98 without a physical meaning , a minimum positive root @xmath27 corresponding to a cauchy horizon , a root @xmath99 interpreted as an event horizon and a root @xmath100 corresponding to a cosmological horizon . according to @xcite these horizons are given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103}.\\ ] ] in the exterior region @xmath104 we introduce a tortoise coordinate @xmath23 by means of the relation @xmath105 taking into account that the surface gravities at the the three horizons are given by @xcite @xmath106 the tortoise coordinate is explicitly given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 hence , the scattering amplitude is given by @xmath109 with @xmath110 by means of the transformation @xmath111 mapping the event horizon to @xmath7 and the cosmological horizon to @xmath112 we can reduce the computation of @xmath113 to the computation of the following integral @xmath114 where @xmath115 with @xmath116 @xmath117 taking into account that @xmath118 it follows that the above integral exists if and only if the imaginary part of the quasinormal mode satisfies the condition @xmath119 fortunately , the integral @xmath74 can be computed in closed form in terms of gamma functions and the lauricella function @xmath120 with @xmath121 whose picard s integral representation is given by @xcite @xmath122 with @xmath123 absolutely convergent for @xmath124 .",
    "an analysis similar to that performed in @xcite shows that the poles of the scattering amplitude are located at @xmath125 but we should disregard them in virtue of the integrability condition ( [ cond - rn - sds ] ) .",
    "for large @xmath22 one can expect that the scattering can be described by a @xmath126 newtonian potential .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , such an analysis has been explicitly performed .",
    "starting with the klein - gordon equation , @xmath127 and using the separation ansatz , @xmath128 the transformation @xmath129^{-1/2}\\ ] ] reveals the asymptotic form , @xmath130\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath131 and @xmath132 is the equivalent coulomb phase shift given by @xmath133 using the property @xmath134 , the partial wave scattering matrix is given by @xmath135 the poles corresponding to the above amplitude are @xmath136 which for large @xmath137 can be written as @xmath138 .",
    "it therefore appears that the large imaginary parts of the qnm frequencies are nothing but the poles of the coulomb - like amplitude .",
    "two comments are in order .",
    "let us first note that in @xcite the signature of the metric is @xmath139 and therefore the time development is proportional to @xmath140 . with @xmath141 ,",
    "this corresponds to a decaying state @xmath142 .",
    "physically this case is equivalent to working with a signature @xmath143 and the time evolution @xmath144 with the qnms given by @xmath145 .",
    "secondly we remark that in atomic physics the definition of the principal quantum number is @xmath146 which is very similar to the definition of @xmath147 above .",
    "the schrdinger like equation ( [ radial ] ) in black hole scattering can be solved using standard techniques for tunneling in quantum mechanics .",
    "the asymptotic solutions of the schrdinger equation ( [ radial ] ) are : @xmath148 @xmath149 for waves incident on the black holes from the right ( i.e. @xmath150 ) , @xmath151 , the reflection amplitude @xmath152 and the transmission amplitude @xmath153 , so that @xmath154 @xmath155 the reflection amplitude @xmath35 is related to the scattering amplitude @xmath156 in one dimension ( 1d ) as @xmath157 , where @xmath158 and reduces to ( [ born1d ] ) in the born approximation .",
    "we shall evaluate @xmath35 numerically via the variable amplitude method .",
    "this @xmath35 corresponds to the exact scattering amplitude @xmath156 and will be compared with @xmath159 .",
    "the variable amplitude method was first introduced in @xcite and has been widely used to evaluate the reflection and transmission coefficients for different potentials in literature @xcite .",
    "the scattering matrix in 1d is given as @xmath160 where @xmath161 , @xmath162 are the reflection and transmission amplitudes respectively for incidence from the left ( @xmath163 ) and @xmath164 , @xmath165 for incidence from the right ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "for elastic scattering , @xmath166 . though the amplitudes for left and right incidence may not necessarily be equal , the reflection and transmission coefficients are the same , i.e. , @xmath167 and @xmath168 . starting with incidence from the right ( and dropping the subscript @xmath169 for convenience ) , we follow the standard procedure @xcite to obtain the riccati equation for black hole scattering .",

    "however , we find from fig .",
    "1 that it does not agree even qualitatively with the exact result for any of the three cases considered .",
    "one can also see that the reflection coefficient at large energies is very small and any agreement ( if at all ) with the born amplitude at high energies becomes irrelevant .",
    "the born approximation for particle scattering from black holes has been studied in detail for the most relevant black hole spacetimes . in summary",
    "we can say :    1 .",
    "we succeeded in writing the integral of the scattering amplitude in the born approximation in terms of special functions .",
    "the quasinormal modes can in principle be extracted from this parametrization .",
    "the conditions for the existence of the born integral impose a validity range on @xmath9 . in all cases of black hole spacetimes",
    "we find that the quasinormal modes found here as well as elsewhere in literature using the born approximation lie outside the validity range .",
    "therefore , it is mathematically impossible to find the quasinormal modes within the born approximation .",
    "we have shown that the quasinormal modes with a large imaginary part can be obtained from the coulomb - like phase shift in black hole scattering .",

    "<S> a massless field propagating on spherically symmetric black hole metrics such as the schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm and reissner - nordstrm - de sitter backgrounds is considered . in particular , explicit formulae in terms of transcendental functions for the scattering of massless scalar particles off black holes are derived within a born approximation . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the conditions on the existence of the born integral forbid a straightforward extraction of the quasi normal modes using the born approximation for the scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> such a method has been used in literature . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a novel , well defined method , to extract the large imaginary part of quasinormal modes via the coulomb - like phase shift . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we compare the numerically evaluated exact scattering amplitude with the born one to find that the approximation is not very useful for the scattering of massless scalar , electromagnetic as well as gravitational waves from black holes . </S>"
