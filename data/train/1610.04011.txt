    "llg equation describes a propagating bloch equation for a moment precessing around magnetic field @xmath94 direction and damped by the @xmath50 term that forces the moment to precess closer to the magnetic field direction thus reducing the initial tilt angle @xmath53 . choosing materials such as ni , ni / nife bilayers as well as yig that possess small @xmath50 , allows long - distance signal propagation since @xmath53 diminishes very weakly in the course of time .",
    "substituting magnetic field control by an electrical one is possible in semiconductors via spin - orbit interaction since it allows generation and manipulation of carrier spins by an electric field  @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit interaction has also been shown to allow electric control of spin - waves in single - crystal yig waveguides which paves the way to develop electrically tunable magnonic devices  @xcite .",
    "another alternative is a tunable spin current that allows to generate a magnetic field or produce a magnetic effect ( such as reversal or alteration of magnetization ) since a spin current targets interconversion between charge and spin degrees of freedom  @xcite .    in analogy with ordinary electronics , spintronics",
    "is based on several operations such as spin injection , filtering , accumulation , detection and pumping  @xcite .",
    "the notion of spin coherence underlies all these operations , that is preservation of a given spin state over long distances despite the presence of impurities , dislocations , noise , stray magnetic fields , earth magnetic field etc ...    spin injection might be done optically in complete analogy with haynes - shockley experiment .",
    "it may also be done with carbon nanotubes since they do not alter the spin state over large distances ( see dietl _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "spin filtering is essentially the separation of spin - polarised carriers which is required for avoiding spin - flips that alter carrier spin states akin to geminate recombination between photo - generated electron - hole pairs .",
    "thin ferromagnetic layers as in spin valves ( see dietl _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and chiral materials such as monolayers of double - stranded dna molecules can be used  @xcite .",
    "spin accumulation is concerned with increase of concentration of spin polarized carriers without destroying their coherence or inducing spin - flips among them whereas spin detection relates to non - destructive determination of spin value .",
    "spin pumping  @xcite occurs in ferromagnetic - normal bilayers , when the precessing magnetization in the ferromagnet ( f ) injects a spin - current into a normal metal ( n ) through the f - n interface ( as in the yig / pt case described previously ) .",

    "<S> nanometric magnonic and spintronic devices need magnetic field control in addition to conventional electronic control . in this work we review ways to replace magnetic field control by an electronic one in order to circumvent appearance of stray magnetic fields or the difficulty of creating large magnetic fields over nanometric distances </S>",
    "<S> . voltage control is compared to current control and corresponding devices are compared from their energetic efficiency point of view . </S>"
