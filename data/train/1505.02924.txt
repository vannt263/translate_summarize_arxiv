    "in recent years , there have been many theoretical studies aimed at understanding the non - equilibrium dynamics of closed quantum systems@xcite , inspired by a series of experiments on cold atomic gases , which are nearly isolated systems with long phase - coherence times , allowing for the study of a coherent quantum dynamics over long time scales @xcite .",
    "these experiments have paved the way to addressing many fundamental questions , such as the role of integrability in thermalization following a quench @xcite or the universal scaling of the defects generated when a system is driven across a quantum critical point @xcite . usually ,",
    "a quantum system is driven out of equilibrium by a slow ramping ( annealing ) or by a sudden quench of a parameter of the hamiltonian ( for example , the transverse magnetic field in the quantum ising model discussed in this paper ) ; the subsequent dynamical response of the system is encoded in several quantities , e.g. , the loschmidt echo @xcite , dynamical correlation functions @xcite , the growth of entanglement entropy @xcite , or the change in diagonal entropy @xcite . in parallel , in the context of the jarzynski equality @xcite and non - equilibrium fluctuation relations @xcite , the question of the emergence of thermodynamical laws from a finite quantum system driven out of equilibrium and the generation of irreversible entropy have been addressed in several recent works @xcite .",
    "one of the ways to characterize the dynamics of an out - of - equilibrium quantum system is to explore the statistics of the performed work  @xcite . given the non - equilibrium nature of the driving protocol , the work ( @xmath3 ) is a stochastic variable and hence described by a probability distribution @xmath2 .",
    "recently , from the analysis of the work statistics in systems quenched across a critical point , it has been shown that non - analyiticities in @xmath15 at some critical times can mark the existence of a sequence of dynamical phase transitions in real time  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the knowledge of @xmath2 enables us to obtain information about some universal features , by connecting it to the critical casimir effect , for sudden quenches ending near the critical point @xcite ; in particular , there exists a power - law edge singularity in @xmath2 , for small @xmath3 , which is characterized by an exponent that is independent of the choice of protocol , but rather depends just on the initial and final values of the parameter being quenched @xcite .",
    "it is usually convenient to define and work with the characteristic function @xmath1 , obtained by fourier transforming @xmath2 .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath1 has been shown to be closely related to the loschmidt echo of a quenched quantum system , both at zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus on a periodically driven integrable closed quantum system , namely the transverse ising chain @xcite , with a spatially homogeneous but time - periodic transverse field @xmath16 , and calculate @xmath2 stroboscopically at the end of @xmath17 complete periods @xmath18 .",
    "it has been shown in the literature @xcite that the system reaches a _ periodic steady state _ in the limit @xmath19 : the residual energy ( which is in fact the first moment of @xmath2 )  and indeed essentially any local observable  reaches a stationary value , when observed at times @xmath20 , in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have observed a similar relaxation to a periodic steady condition also for a genuinely quantum non - local object , the so - called dynamical fidelity  @xcite . in the present work",
    "we will investigate what happens to @xmath1 , and hence to @xmath2 , under such periodic driving in the asymptotic limit @xmath21 , and address the question of the universal behaviour emerging in the small-@xmath3 region .",
    "working within the framework of the floquet theory @xcite , and assuming that the initial state is a gibbs state at temperature @xmath22 , we provide an analytical form of the characteristic function @xmath1 in terms of floquet quasi - energies and corresponding overlaps between the initial state and the floquet eigenstates .",
    "@xmath1 is then used to arrive at an exact expression of @xmath2 at zero temperature : we demonstrate that indeed @xmath2 also tends to `` synchronize '' with the periodic driving in the limit @xmath19 , converging to a well - defined asymptotic work distribution function @xmath23 , whose small-@xmath3 behaviour depends only on the properties of the small - wavevector modes , ultimately controlled by the time - averaged value of the transverse field @xmath24 , and its initial value @xmath25 .",
    "all universal features of the work distribution are encoded into a singularity of @xmath2 for small @xmath3 .",
    "the position @xmath10 of the edge of that singularity depends only on the distance of @xmath5 from the equilibrium critical point @xmath6 , while its detailed form  a dirac delta derivative or a square root singularity  depends on @xmath4 being or not at a _ non - equilibrium critical point _ @xmath11  determined by @xmath7 with @xmath8 integer  where the floquet spectrum turns out to be gapless . when @xmath26 , the generating function @xmath1 has a power law decay @xmath27 , which results into a step singularity in @xmath23 at @xmath14 for @xmath28 , or a mild @xmath29 increase for larger integer @xmath30 .",
    "the non - equilibrium phase transitions we find are reminescent of those discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but are different in many aspects , notably in residing at low frequency , as we will discuss .",
    "an important aspect of these results is that the small-@xmath3 properties of @xmath23 are determined ( as we are going to show in detail in the paper ) exclusively by the small-@xmath31 modes : the aspects of the dynamics independent of the details of the driving protocol rely only on the large wavelenght modes which encode the universal properties of the ground state in the static system  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , a similar fact can be observed in two coupled luttinger liquids undergoing a quantum quench  @xcite : if the quenched operator is relevant in the renormalization group sense ( and then affecting mainly the long wavelength modes ) then the phase coherence evolves with a universal scaling function .",
    "finally we move to the finite temperature case : starting from an initial mixed state at finite temperature , we will show that the irreversible entropy generated during the periodic driving tends to `` synchronize '' with the driving for @xmath19 .",
    "it saturates to a steady state value for large @xmath0 , displaying a sequence of dips and peaks for small and intermediate values of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we note in passing a recent study on the work statistics of a periodically driven system which has explored the universal properties of the rate function , that is found to satisfy a lower bound and has a zero when @xmath3 matches the residual energy @xcite .",

    "technical details of our derivations are contained in three appendices .",
    "we present here , for the readers convenience , some basic facts about the work distribution function , following refs .",
    "suppose that a closed quantum system undergoes a time - dependent driving such that its hamiltonian is @xmath32 , while the system was at the initial time @xmath33 in a given ( possibly mixed ) state @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath35 is the probability that the system has energy @xmath36 at the initial time , and @xmath37 the conditional probability that the system is observed to have energy @xmath38 at some later time @xmath39 , then the work distribution function is defined as : @xmath40 to deal with the dirac s deltas appearing in the definition of @xmath41 it is convenient to study the fourier transform of @xmath41 , arriving at the characteristic function : @xmath42 with simple manipulations , and introducing the unitary evolution operator @xmath43 for the closed quantum system , it results that : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the final hamiltonian in heisenberg representation , and we have assumed that the initial state is such that @xmath46=0 $ ] ( a gibbs or micro - canonical state would do that ) .",
    "we note , in passing , that the quantum jarzynski equality  @xcite follows immediately from the previous expression by taking @xmath47 and assuming an initial gibbs state @xmath48 : @xmath49",
    "let us now specialize our discussion to the quantum ising chain in a uniform time - periodic transverse field ( although some progress might be done in the general non - homogeneous case ) .",

    "this is certainly enough for describing the ground state and the dynamics starting from the ground state . at finite temperature , the contributions due to the extra odd - fermion - parity term , @xmath64 ,",
