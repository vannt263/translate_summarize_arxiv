    "at hera a class of neutral current ( nc ) deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) events has been observed which is characterized by a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) between the proton beam direction and a multi - particle final state @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of the lrg event fraction points to a leading twist production mechanism .",
    "the rate of lrg events is most commonly accounted for by introducing `` diffractive '' processes , which proceed via the t - channel exchange of a colour singlet object with quantum numbers of the vacuum , called the pomeron ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "however , the nature of the pomeron is at present far from clear .",
    "ingelman and schlein @xcite assumed that the pomeron emitted from the proton behaves like a hadron and suggested that it could have a partonic substructure which could be probed by a hard scattering process .",
    "the ua8 experiment at cern later observed events containing two high-@xmath75 jets in @xmath76 interactions which were tagged with leading protons ( or antiprotons ) . this observation was explained in terms of a partonic structure in the pomeron @xcite .",
    "+ jet production in lrg events at hera in the photoproduction regime @xcite and the pattern of scaling violations in diffractive dis @xcite led to the conclusion that in order to interpret the data within the ingelman - schlein approach , the pomeron must have a high gluon content .",
    "+ various models for diffractive scattering can be used to describe the hadronic final state in lrg events @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predictions range from a calculation of gluon pair exchange @xcite , to a phenomenological description of pomeron quark and gluon densities @xcite and to a boson - gluon fusion scheme , where the resulting quark pair evolves into a colour singlet state @xcite .",
    "recently , calculations for two- and three - jet production in dis rapidity gap events have been presented , in which a scalar pomeron is considered to have a pointlike coupling to quark and gluon pairs @xcite .",
    "+ in order to obtain a deeper understanding of multihadronic final states with a large rapidity gap , we study shape variables in the centre of mass frame of the observed hadronic system ( of mass @xmath5 ) , interpreting this as the @xmath77 c.m . system , and investigate their dependence upon @xmath5 .",
    "this is in analogy with the studies of shape variables in @xmath78 annihilation as a function of @xmath79 @xcite and to those which led to the interpretation of three - jet events as a consequence of gluon bremsstrahlung @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied to the dependence of fixed target antineutrino data as a function of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the data presented here , taken with the zeus detector at hera in 1994 , correspond to a luminosity of 2.57@xmath800.04  @xmath81 .",
    "hera operated with 153 colliding bunches of 820  gev protons and 27.5 gev positrons .",
    "additional unpaired positron and proton bunches circulated , which were used to determine beam related backgrounds .    a description of the zeus detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the components used in this analysis are briefly discussed here .",
    "the uranium - scintillator calorimeter ( cal )  @xcite covers 99.7% of the total solid angle .",
    "it consists of the forward calorimeter ( fcal ) covering the range in pseudorapidity axis pointing in the proton beam direction , and the @xmath82 axis horizontal , pointing towards the centre of hera .",
    "the pseudorapidity is defined as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the polar angle with respect to the proton direction . ]",
    "@xmath85 , the barrel calorimeter ( bcal ) covering @xmath86 and the rear calorimeter ( rcal ) covering @xmath87 .",
    "each calorimeter part is segmented into electromagnetic ( emc ) and hadronic ( hac ) sections .",
    "each section is further subdivided into cells of typically @xmath88 @xmath89 ( @xmath90  @xmath89 in the rcal ) for the emc and @xmath91  @xmath89 for the hac sections . under test beam conditions the calorimeter has an energy resolution of @xmath92  =  18%/@xmath93 for electrons and @xmath92  =  35%/@xmath94 for hadrons .",
    "the timing resolution of a calorimeter cell is less than 1 ns for energy deposits greater than @xmath95 . in order to minimize the effects of noise due to the uranium radioactivity on the energy measurements all emc(hac ) cells with an energy deposit of less than 60(110 )  mev are discarded from the analysis .",
    "the tracking system consists of a vertex detector ( vxd )  @xcite , a central tracking chamber ( ctd )  @xcite , and a rear tracking detector ( rtd )  @xcite enclosed in a 1.43 t solenoidal magnetic field .",
    "the interaction vertex is measured with a typical resolution along and transverse to the beam direction of @xmath96  cm and @xmath97  cm respectively .",
    "the position of positrons scattered at small angles with respect to the positron beam direction is measured using the small angle rear tracking detector ( srtd ) which is attached to the front face of the rcal . the srtd @xcite consists of two planes of scintillator strips , each one 1 cm wide and 0.5 cm thick , arranged in orthogonal directions and read out via optical fibers and photo - multiplier tubes .",
    "the luminosity is measured via the bethe - heitler process , @xmath98 , using a lead - scintillator calorimeter ( lumi )  @xcite which accepts photons at angles  @xmath99  0.5  mrad with respect to the positron beam direction and is located at @xmath100  m.",
    "the kinematic variables used to describe deep inelastic @xmath101 scattering @xmath102 are the following :    the negative squared four - momentum transfer carried by the virtual photon @xmath103 the bjorken @xmath104 variable @xmath105 the fractional energy transfer to the hadronic final state @xmath106 and the square of the centre - of - mass energy of the virtual - photon proton system ( @xmath107 ) @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the proton mass .",
    "these variables , only two of which are independent , can be determined either from the scattered positron or from the hadronic system . they can also be determined from a mixed set of variables , the so - called double angle method @xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "the scattered positron method is used because it provides a better resolution in the kinematic range under study .",
    "the variables @xmath2 and @xmath110 , calculated from the scattered positron variables , are given by the expressions @xmath111 and @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the incident positron energy and @xmath114 and @xmath115 denote the energy and angle , with respect to the proton direction , of the scattered positron .",
    "to identify the neutral current dis events the quantity @xmath116 is also used : @xmath117 where @xmath118 denotes the energy assigned to the signal in calorimeter cell @xmath119 and @xmath120 , @xmath121 being the polar angle of the cell .",
    "the sum is running over all calorimeter cells .",
    "for fully contained dis events , and neglecting detector smearing effects , @xmath122 .    in order to describe the kinematics of diffractive scattering @xmath123 the following two additional variables",
    "are introduced : the squared four - momentum transfer at the proton vertex , @xmath124 whose absolute magnitude is small compared to @xmath125 in the diffractive processes selected in this analysis , and @xmath126 , the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the pomeron , defined as @xmath127 where @xmath5 is the mass of the hadronic system .",
    "in addition , the variable @xmath128 is defined as @xmath129 which can be interpreted as the fraction of the pomeron momentum carried by the struck quark .",
    "events were filtered online by a three level trigger system  @xcite . at the first level @xcite , dis events are selected by requiring a minimum energy deposition in the emc section of the cal .",
    "the threshold varies between 3.4 gev ( in the rcal ) and 4.8 gev ( in the bcal ) . at the second level ( slt ) ,",
    "non-@xmath101 background is further reduced by using the measured times of energy deposits and the summed energies from the calorimeter .",
    "the events are accepted if + @xmath130 , where @xmath118 and @xmath121 are the energies and polar angles of calorimeter cells , and @xmath131 is the energy deposit measured in the lumi photon calorimeter .",

    "the full event information is available at the third level trigger ( tlt ) .",
    "tighter timing cuts as well as algorithms to remove beam halo and cosmic muons are applied .",
    "the quantity @xmath133 was determined in the same way as @xmath132 .",
    "the events were required to have . finally , events were accepted if a scattered positron candidate of energy greater than 4  gev was found . in total 900,853",
    "nc dis candidates satisfied the above trigger conditions .",
    "dis events were selected off - line by looking for scattered positron candidates recognized using the pattern of energy deposition in the calorimeter .",
    "the efficiency of the positron identification algorithm , as well as the procedures to incorporate information from the srtd in order to improve the positron energy and scattering angle measurements are thoroughly discussed in our recent publication on the measurement of the proton structure function @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "the off - line cuts used to select multihadronic dis events are the following :    * @xmath135 .",
    "* @xmath136 . * @xmath137 .",
    "this cut removes fake positrons found in the fcal . *",
    "this cut removes events with large initial state qed radiation and further reduces the background from photoproduction . * the events are required to have a reconstructed vertex .",
    "this cut suppresses beam - gas background .",
    "* events with a scattered positron impact point in the rcal inside a box of 26@xmath139@xmath140 cm around the beam pipe are rejected .",
    "this guarantees full containment of the shower in the calorimeter .",
    "a total of 294,527 events were selected this way .",
    "the mass of the final state hadronic system , @xmath5 , can be reconstructed from the energy deposited in the calorimeter cells , excluding those assigned to the outgoing positron .",
    "this reconstruction is sensitive to calorimeter noise effects . to improve it , especially at low masses",
    ", we removed isolated cells with energy below 140 ( 160 ) mev for emc ( hac ) cells .",
    "the following formula was used for the mass reconstruction : @xmath141 the coefficients @xmath142 and @xmath143 correct for the effects of energy loss in the inactive material and energy deposits below the threshold .",
    "their values , @xmath144  gev and @xmath145 , were determined from the monte carlo simulation so as to give the best estimate of the true invariant mass in diffractive events in the kinematic region of the analysis . in this region ,",

    "diffractive events are characterized by a small value of @xmath5 .",
    "however a simple selection based on @xmath146 is not enough to select diffractive events because the non - diffractive background would be too high even at relatively low values of the mass .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn - lnmx2]b where the @xmath148 distribution for the dis sample with and without a forward rapidity gap requirement is presented along with a comparison with non - diffractive monte carlo expectations normalized to the integrated luminosity . therefore , to reduce such background and extend the range of mass , a selection based on the presence of a forward rapidity gap is applied .",

    "the lower limit rejects events where the phase space for qcd radiation is limited .",
    "the upper cut is dictated mainly by the lack of statistics at high masses , a consequence of the @xmath150 requirement .",
    "* @xmath155 .",
    "this cut helps to suppress the non - diffractive dis background @xcite . *",
    "more than three condensates .",
    "this requirement ensures that an event plane for the hadronic final state @xmath82 can be determined .",
    "a total of 2748 events are selected by these requirements .",
    "this sample is estimated to have a contamination from beam - gas background below @xmath156 , based on the distribution of events in unpaired bunches .",
    "the background due to photoproduction is estimated to be less than @xmath157 from monte carlo studies .",
    "both backgrounds have been neglected in the analysis .",
    "the resulting reconstructed values of @xmath126 are below 0.01 , thus the selected sample is expected to be due to pomeron exchange  @xcite .",
    "the remaining non - diffractive dis background varies from @xmath158 at the lower end to @xmath159 at the upper end of the mass range defined above ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn - lnmx2]b ) .",
    "the background calculation has been checked by reweighting the exponential fall - off in the monte carlo sample in order to agree with estimates from fits to the data for @xmath160 with @xmath146 in gev @xcite .",

    "the calculations assume that the pomeron is emitted at the proton vertex according to the donnachie - landshoff flux factor .",
