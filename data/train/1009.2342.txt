    "the modification of the qcd vacuum , and of its thermal excitations as well , under the influence of external fields , is an attractive topic .",
    "firstly , it is extremely interesting to understand how an external field can modify the main characteristics of confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "secondly , strong magnetic fields , with order of magnitude between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , might be produced in the very first moments of the non - central heavy ion collisions  @xcite . in this case",
    ", it has been argued that the non - trivial topological structure of thermal qcd gives rise to chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) @xcite .",
    "an useful approach to the physics of strong interactions in external magnetic fields is the use of some model . among them ,",
    "the nambu - jona lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite is quite popular , see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews . in this model ,",
    "the qcd gluon - mediated interactions are replaced by effective interactions among quarks , which are built in order to respect the global symmetries of qcd . on the other hand",
    ", the njl model lacks confinement of color .",
    "it is well known that color confinement can be described in terms of the center symmetry of the color gauge group and of the polyakov loop  @xcite , which is an order parameter for the center symmetry .",
    "motivated by this property , the polyakov loop extended nambu - jona lasinio model ( p - njl model ) has been introduced  @xcite , in which the concept of statistical confinement replaces that of the true confinement of qcd , and an effective interaction among the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop is achieved by a covariant coupling of quarks with a background temporal gluon field . in the literature , there are several studies about various aspects of the p - njl model  @xcite .",
    "lattice studies on the response of the qcd ground state to external magnetic and chromomagnetic fields can be found in  @xcite .",
    "previous studies of qcd in magnetic fields , and of qcd - like theories as well , can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    beside the polyakov loop",
    ", it has been suggested  @xcite that another observable which is an order parameter for the center symmetry , hence for confinement , is the dressed polyakov loop .",
    "the dressed polyakov loop has been computed in refs .",
    "@xcite within the scheme of truncated schwinger - dyson equations ; within the nambu - jona lasinio model , @xmath2 has been computed at finite temperature and chemical potential in  @xcite .",
    "finally , the dressed polyakov loop has been computed within the pnjl model in  @xcite at finite temperature , and in  @xcite at finite temperature with strong magnetic field .    in this talk , i present results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite about the phase structure and the dressed polyakov loop of hot two massive flavor quark matter at zero chemical potential , in an external magnetic field . to compute the effective potential , i rely on the pnjl model of strongly interacting quarks .",
    "i consider here two flavor quark matter whose lagrangian density is specified as  @xcite @xmath3 \\nonumber \\\\          & & + g_8\\left[(\\bar q q)^2 + ( \\bar q i \\gamma_5 \\bm\\tau          q)^2\\right]^2~. \\label{eq : lagr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the covariant derivative embeds the quark coupling to the external magnetic field and to the background gluon field as well , see below . in eq .",
    ", @xmath4 represents a quark field in the fundamental representation of color and flavor ( indices are suppressed for notational simplicity ) ; @xmath5 is a vector of pauli matrices in flavor space ; @xmath6 is the bare quark mass , which is fixed to reproduce the pion mass in the vacuum , @xmath7 mev .",
    "the model at hand is called polyakov loop extended nambu - jona lasinio model ( pnjl in the following ) , since a coupling of the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop is introduced via the covariant derivative in eq .",
    ", see below .    in this study ,",
    "i limit myself to the one - loop approximation for the partition function . in order to couple the polyakov loop to the quark fields , it is customary , in the pnjl model , to introduce a background temporal , static and homogeneous euclidean gluon field , @xmath8 , in terms of which the polyakov loop is given by @xmath9/3 $ ] .",
    "@xmath8 is coupled to the quarks via the covariant derivative , see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ; as a consequence , a coupling among the quark fields and the polyakov loop arises naturally when the integration over fermion fields in the partition function is performed .",
    "i work in the landau gauge , and take the magnetic field homogeneous , static and aligned with the positive @xmath10axe .",
    "moreover , i take twisted fermion boundary conditions along the compact temporal direction , @xmath11~ , \\label{eq : phi}\\ ] ] while for spatial directions the usual periodic boundary condition is taken . the one - loop thermodynamic potential in the general case of twisted boundary conditions",

    "moreover , @xmath17 , with @xmath18  . the arguments of the thermal exponentials are defined as @xmath19 , with @xmath20 defined in eq .  .",
    "the vacuum part of the thermodynamic potential , @xmath21 , is ultraviolet divergent . in this study ,",
    "i use a smooth regularization procedure by introducing a form factor @xmath22 in the diverging zero - point energy . the potential term @xmath23 $ ] in eq .",
    "is built by hand in order to reproduce the pure gluonic lattice data  @xcite . among several different potential choices",
    "i adopt the logarithmic form of  @xcite .",
    "following  @xcite , i introduce the dual quark condensate , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an integer .",
    "the expectation value @xmath26 denotes the path integral over gauge field configurations .",
    "the case @xmath27 is called the _ dressed _ polyakov loop . for my later convenience ,",
    "i scale the definition of the dressed polyakov loop in eq .  , and introduce @xmath28 where @xmath29 corresponds to the expectation value of the @xmath30 field computed keeping twisted boundary conditions for fermions .",

    "the results on the dressed polyakov loop , @xmath2 , in magnetic field show that this quantity is capable to describe both polyakov loop and chiral crossovers .",
    "this is resumed in the double peak structure of its effective susceptibility .",
