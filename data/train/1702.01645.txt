    "in classical mechanics , kapitza pendulum or stephenson - kapitza pendulum @xcite is a statically unstable inverted pendulum whose statically unstable equilibrium position is stabilized by small fast vertical oscillations of the pivot point .",
    "this _ induced stability _ initially described by a.  stephenson @xcite has been first explained by p.  l.  kapitza @xcite . to find theoretical reason of the _ induced stability _",
    "kapitza separated the pendulum motion into fast and slow oscillations and , by averaging out fast ones , found the effective potential which has minimum at the pendulum upper position , in contrast to a simple pendulum .",
    "this approach created a new concept of _ dynamic stabilization _ in mechanics @xcite .",
    "chelomei s pendulum provides another well known example of dynamically stabilized mechanical system @xcite .",
    "the _ induced stability _ can be vindicated beyond the framework of the method of fast and slow motions separation @xcite .",
    "in general , a spatial inhomogeneity of an oscillating driving force creates a quasi - steady ponderomotive force @xcite , directed against the spatial gradient of the driving force . in the kapitza pendulum , this ponderomotive force acts against gravitation and makes the upper position stable .",
    "a dissipation dampens oscillations around the upper equilibrium position thus further stabilizing it .",
    "when no other forces present besides the oscillating driving force , as in the case of charged particle dynamics in a standing electromagnetic wave , the ponderomotive force always repels particles from the maxima of the wave spatial amplitude @xcite .    here",
    "we present a general model of a dissipative dynamic system driven by an oscillating force , where a strong nonlinear highly oscillatory friction creates a quasi - steady tug , which , quite counter - intuitively , is always directed opposite to the ponderomotive force and exceeds it for a sufficiently strong driving force .",
    "this leads to a seemingly paradoxical stabilization of the system oscillations near the maxima of the spatial amplitude of the driving force .",
    "it differs from the kapitza pendulum effect in that here the stabilization factor is a nonlinear growth of the friction with the driver force , which creates a tug against the ponderomotive potential .",
    "we consider a simple one - dimensional model of a forced oscillation with a strong nonlinear friction , given by the equation @xmath0 here the dot denotes differentiation with respect to time ; @xmath1 is a natural number .",
    "the friction coefficient @xmath2 is a non - negative function of the oscillating driving force @xmath3 , @xmath4 the model is motivated by the dynamics of a charged particle in a strong electromagnetic field , where accelerating particles lose energy and undergo a recoil due to their emission of electromagnetic radiation @xcite .",

    "it can even exceed the latter in magnitude , when @xmath36 in this case , trajectories of the system described by the model ( [ eq : model ] ) drift to the local maximum of the driving force spatial amplitude .",
    "if the system were non - dissipative , the oscillations near that maximum would be destabilized by the ponderomotive force , so that the corresponding trajectories would drift _ against _ the spatial gradient of the driving force and would eventually escape to regions of a lower spatial amplitude of the driving force @xcite .",

    "the threshold for the described stabilization of forced oscillations corresponds to the criterion of the importance of the radiation reaction effects @xcite .    in a standing electromagnetic waves , which can be formed in multiple high power laser configurations @xcite ,",
    "the stabilization due to a strong radiation reaction is manifested in an anomalous electron bunching near the electric field maxima @xcite . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , electrons can be captured for many laser periods due to radiation friction impeding the ponderomotive force .",
    "when radiation reaction dominates , the electron motion in a standing wave evolves to limit cycles and strange attractors @xcite . in the case of a circularly polarized standing wave ,",
    "analytical expressions exist for the limit cycles near the electric field maxima @xcite .",
    "a collision of multiple ultra - intense electromagnetic waves creates structurally determinate patterns in the electron phase space @xcite due to a counterplay of the ponderomotive force and the friction - induced tug .",
    "although in the present work we have been motivated by the intention to build up the theory of the radiative electron dynamics in the field of extremely high intensity lasers , we believe that the formulated above concept of dissipative stabilization of nonlinear dynamic systems will be useful for applications well beyond the framework of the laser - matter interaction physics @xcite , remembering a saying of william thomson ( lord kelvin ) `` i never satisfy myself until i can make a mechanical model of a thing '' @xcite .    99    p. l. kapitza , soviet phys .",
