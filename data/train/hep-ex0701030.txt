    "the top quark is the heaviest known fundamental fermion of the standard model ( sm ) with a mass of  @xmath1  @xmath2 , close to the electroweak breaking scale .",
    "this unexpected large mass delayed for several years its discovery .",
    "it occurred only 11 years ago at the @xmath3 collider tevatron  @xcite , during the so called run i  ( 1992 - 1996 ) .    the high mass of the top quark implies a large coupling to the higgs boson ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this makes think it could play a particular role in the electroweak breaking mechanism and may be the gatekeeper to physics beyond the sm .",
    "it also causes large effect to the @xmath5 boson propagation through virtual quantum effects , so that precision measurements of the top mass together with the @xmath5 mass put strong constraints to the yet to be discovered higgs boson . besides , this quark has a very short lifetime and decays before it hadronizes .",
    "therefore the bare quark properties are transfered to his decay products and are not hidden in the spectroscopy that we observe for the other heavy flavor quarks .",
    "top physics can be studied at several levels .",
    "first the production mechanism can be examined , for example by looking at the production kinematics or searching for a resonant production .",
    "secondly the particle properties , can be studied , such as its mass , width , lifetime , spin and charge .",
    "finally the decay properties and the couplings can be studied by looking at the decay products , their kinematics or searching for rare decays .",
    "as the top discovery is recent and only a few events were recorded during run i , top physics still need to be studied in details .",
    "the only existing top factory at this time , is the tevatron , running at 1.96 tev since the beginning of run ii in spring 2001 .",
    "one of the main physics goal of the tevatron experiments , cdf and d , is the study of the top physics .    as of summer 2006 ,",
    "both experiments have about 1 fb@xmath6 of data available for physics analyzes , which is almost 8 times more than what was collected during run  i. analysis presented in the following are based on smaller subsets , from 300 to 750  @xmath7 .",
    "this is still a small fraction of what is expected to be recorded by the end of run ii , in 2009 : between 4 and 8 @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "at the tevatron , the top quarks are mainly produced by pair .",
    "the quark anti - quark annihilation contributes at the level of @xmath9 while the gluon - gluon annihilation is only @xmath10 .",
    "the main diagrams for these processes are displayed in figure  [ fig : diag - toppair ] .",
    "the cross - section is predicted to be @xmath11  pb  @xcite , the level of uncertainty being @xmath12 .    typically for @xmath13  @xmath8  of data and for a channel with a branching ratio of 30% and an acceptance of 15% ,",
    "300 events per experiment are expected to be observed .",
    "single top quarks can be produced via the electroweak coupling to the @xmath5 boson .",
    "the main diagrams for these processes are displayed in figure  [ fig : diag - singletop ] .",
    "since they have a different final state , the @xmath14channel and @xmath15channel are usually distinguished .",
    "the @xmath14 and the @xmath15 channels have respectively cross sections of the order of 0.88  pb and 1.98  pb which is quite low . given that the background is quite high ( there is only one top as a signature ) , this process has not been observed yet and ongoing analysis are searching for it .     and",
    "@xmath15channels have different final states.,title=\"fig:\",width=132 ] and @xmath15channels have different final states.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]",
    "within the standard model , the top decays into a @xmath5 boson and a @xmath16 quark almost 100% of the time .",
    "the different channels arise from the possible decays of the pair of @xmath5 bosons : either @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , or @xmath19 ( @xmath18 ) , or @xmath20 ( @xmath18 ) , or @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the main channels are then :    * `` lepton + jets '' channels ( @xmath23 ) correspond to events for which one @xmath5 decays hadronically and the other one decays into electrons or muons .",
    "these channels have a moderate yield and a moderate background arising from @xmath5+jets production , @xmath24+jets production , or qcd processes .",
    "* `` di - lepton '' channels ( @xmath25 ) correspond to events for which the two @xmath5 decay into electrons or muons .",
    "these channels are very pure but have a small yield .",
    "the background is due to di - bons events ( mainly @xmath26+jets production ) , @xmath24+jets and also qcd processes .",
    "* `` all jets channels '' ( @xmath27 ) correspond to events where both @xmath5 bosons decay hadronically .",
    "the yield is high , but the background arising from qcd multi - jet production is very large .",
    "* `` tau channels '' ( @xmath28 ) arise from events where at least one of the @xmath5 decays into @xmath29 .",
    "as the @xmath29 decays are hard to identify , especially in a hadronic environment as at tevatron , these channels are weakly exploited .",
    "because of the high mass of the top quark , the decay products have high momenta and large angular separations . reconstructing and identifying the production of top quarks demands reconstruction and identification of high transverse momenta ( @xmath30 ) electrons , muons , jets , and the measurement of the missing transverse energy ( ) .",
    "good momentum resolution for these objects is required and the jet energy scale ( jes ) has also to be known with a good precision .",
    "identifying the @xmath16-jets is an effective way of improving the purity of the selections .",
    "the @xmath16-tagging makes use of the presence of secondary vertices and tracks with high impact parameters involved by the decays of @xmath16-hadrons .",
    "typically for @xmath31 , a 50% efficiency per @xmath16-jet is achieved while the mistag rate is about @xmath32 .",
    "both cdf and d   analyze their data using various methods , in the different channels .",
    "these numerous analysis are updated as the amount of data increases . only a few examples and the typical selections are discussed in the following .",
    "the signature consists of a central spherical energetic events , with a high @xmath33  lepton and a high .",
    "four or more jets can be reconstructed . among them",
    "two jets are expected to arise from @xmath16-quark .",
    "the cuts to preselect the events are typically : high @xmath33  lepton trigger ( lepton+jets trigger at d ) , isolated lepton with @xmath34  @xmath35 , @xmath36  gev , 4 jets with @xmath37  @xmath35 .",
    "usually the scalar transverse energy @xmath38 defined as the sum of transverse momenta of the reconstructed objects of the events , @xmath39 events are expected to have a higher @xmath38 than the background .    to discriminate between signal and background after these preselections , two main approaches are employed : either the tagging of @xmath16-jets or topological cuts which maximize the use of the events kinematics .",
    "each of these approaches is also a cross - check of the other one .",
    "the acceptance is typically at the level of 10 to 20% ( for @xmath40 ) , it is determined with the simulation ( mc ) , corrected for data / mc weights measured on independent samples .",
    "the backgrounds arise mainly from @xmath41 jets , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( here @xmath45 stands for light partons , as opposed to heavy flavor , @xmath16 or @xmath46 ) .",
    "these backgrounds are determined with the mc , but as the yield suffers from high theoretical uncertainties , these backgrounds are normalized to the data .",
    "non-@xmath5 background is mainly qcd where one jet fakes a lepton , it is determined on the data . the @xmath26+jets background is determined using the mc .",
    "output of the selected events for the topological lepton+jets analysis at cdf.,width=283 ]    this analysis is based on an artificial neural network ( ann ) which combines seven kinematic variables to discriminate against the main background , @xmath5+jets .",
    "a likelihood fit of the ann output distribution allows to determine the @xmath47 content of the selected events as quoted in table  [ tab : cdf_ljet_nn_result ] .",
    "the ann output distribution for selected events is shown in figure  [ fig : cdf_ljet_nn ] .",
    "the measurement based on 760  @xmath7  of data reads : @xmath48    .results of the cdf topological letpon+jets analysis .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     .",
    "this method employed at cdf is very different from the other ones , as it does not rely on the energy measurements of outgoing particles .",
    "thus it is an important cross - check with reduced impact from the jes uncertainty .",
    "the method makes use of the b hadron decay length and the boost of the b - quark in top decays , directly related to the top mass : @xmath49    in a lepton+jets sample selected from 695 @xmath7  of data , the decay length of the b - hadrons are reconstructed and compared to template simulated with different top mass hypothesis .",
    "the result reads : @xmath50    as expected , the impact of jes uncertainty is very small , but the result is statistically limited using the present data sample .",
    "however such kind of analysis will become competitive at the end of run ii , when ten times more data will be recorded .",
    "nine measurements performed at cdf and d  have been combined to achieve a 1.3% accuracy : @xmath51    the various measurements are summarized in figure  [ fig : cdf_d0_mass_summary ] .",
    "the chi square of the combination is @xmath52 which demonstrate a good consistency .",
    "it should be stressed that the run  iia goal was to obtain a 2.5  @xmath2  combined uncertainty using @xmath53 of data .",
    "this goal has been exceeded .",
    "the 1% precision is in sight for the near future .",
    "masses from current lep2 and tevatron data and for future tevatron / lhc and ilc sensitivities .",
    "these are overlaid onto bands of predicted higgs masses for the sm , as well as for different susy scenario  @xcite .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    .",
    "the top mass is a free parameter in the standard model .",
    "but its mass can be related to various electroweak observables thanks to radiative corrections .",
    "thus the measurement of the top mass provides a consistency check of the sm that can be used to probe for new physics .",
    "in particular the top mass plays an important role in the radiative corrections to the @xmath5 boson propagator : @xmath54 .",
    "as the higgs boson mass also influences the @xmath5 boson mass through radiative corrections , @xmath55 , the combined measurements of the @xmath5 and top masses yield constraints onto the sm higgs boson mass .    using the top mass combined measurement presented in the previous section ,",
    "the sm higgs boson is predicted to have a mass fulfilling ( spring 2006 ) : @xmath56 and the upper bound at 95% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "is : @xmath57 it is worthwhile to notice that our present data tend to favor supersymmetry over the standard model  @xcite as shown in figure  [ fig : mt_vs_mw ] .",
    "other properties than the top mass can be measured at tevatron to check the sm consistency and search for new physics .      within the sm",
    ", the top quark charge is expected to be @xmath58 , but one can imagine model in which a heavy quark exists that carries a different charge .",
    "for example as in @xcite one can imagine an exotic right doublet @xmath59 of charge @xmath60 , @xmath61 being the heavy quark observed at tevatron . in the semi - leptonic mode",
    ", the top quark of charge @xmath58 decays into @xmath62 while a quark of charge @xmath63 would decay into @xmath64 .",
    "the d  collaboration has analyzed 370  @xmath7  of data to select a pure lepton+jets+2 b - tag sample .",
    "to associate to right b - jet to the ( lepton , ) system a fit to the top mass is performed .",
    "the charge of a b - jet is defined by weighting the contribution of the charged tracks matched to the jets : @xmath65    two observables allow to measure to top charge twice per event : @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath16 is the b - jet matched to the lepton and @xmath68 is the other b - jet . a fit of mc templates to the data distribution of @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    "is performed , which yields the exclusion of @xmath71 at the 93.7% confidence level .",
    "the distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : d0_top_charge ] .",
    "the measured top lifetime could be significantly different from the sm value , @xmath72 , if for example a long lived decaying particles is involved in the top production .",
    "a top lifetime analysis has been performed at cdf using 318  @xmath7  of data in a lepton+jets+1  b - tag selection .",
    "the impact parameter of the lepton is used as an observable related to the top decay length .",
    "a maximum likelihood fit of the impact parameter from data to mc templates yields the exclusion of long decay length : @xmath73 at 95% confidence level .",
    "studying the @xmath74 vertex is an important test of the sm which probes the @xmath75 nature of the weak interaction and also checks the unitarity of the ckm matrix .      within the sm",
    "the ckm matrix element is involved in the top branching fractions : @xmath76    to measure this branching fraction , d  has selected a sample of lepton+jets events in 230  @xmath7  of data . by counting the number of selected events and the number of b - tag jets , a simultaneous determination of @xmath77 and the @xmath47 cross - section is performed . since there is no a priori regarding the b - jet content of the events , a model indepent cross - section is obtained .",
    "the results of the 2d fit are displayed in figure  [ fig : d0_top_br ] .",
    "they are well in agreement with the standard model expectations : @xmath78 @xmath79     in the d  experiment.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the same kind of studies has also been conducted at cdf . using 162  @xmath7",
    "the cdf collaboration also measures a branching fraction in agreement with the sm : @xmath80      in the standard model , the @xmath75 nature of the electroweak interaction is also present in the @xmath74 vertex . as a consequence ,",
    "almost @xmath81 of the @xmath5 arising from the top decays should have a right - handed helicity .",
    "one also expects @xmath82 of longitudinal @xmath5 and @xmath83 of left - handed @xmath5 .    by studying the @xmath5 decay product kinematics , it is possible to measure the @xmath5 helicity and probe @xmath75 structure of the electroweak interaction at energy close to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "several variables can be used to relate the event topology to the @xmath5 helicity : the @xmath33  of the leptons , the decay angle of the leptons in the top rest frame , @xmath84 , or the invariant mass @xmath85 .",
    "a fit to the @xmath86 spectrum observed from lepton+jets and di - lepton top events with 695@xmath7  at cdf yields a result perfectly compatible with the sm : @xmath87 @xmath88    at d , using 370  @xmath7  of data , the study of the @xmath89 spectrum in lepton+jets and di - lepton samples also shows a good agreement with the sm : @xmath90          as mentioned in section  [ sec : singletop ] , the production of single top involves the @xmath74 coupling in two different channels : the s - channel gives rise to a @xmath91 final state with kinematic properties different from the t - channel and its @xmath92 final state .",
    "the high background arises from w+jets , especially w+@xmath16-jets , and also from the @xmath47 production . to discriminate against the background ,",
    "multivariate techniques are used both at d  and cdf : ann , likelihood or decision trees .",
    "for example at d , 4 likelihood variables are built to discriminate : t - channel against @xmath47 , t - channel against @xmath93 , s - channel against @xmath47 and s - channel against @xmath93 .",
    "figure  [ fig : d0_singletop_disc ] shows two out of the four possible distributions for these likelihood variables .",
    "given the present luminosity , the single top has not been observed in the data and both d  and cdf have set limits on the cross - section , which are in agreement with the sm expectations : at d the results arising from the likelihood analysis with 370  @xmath7  of data are : @xmath94 @xmath95 at cdf with 695  @xmath7  of data , an ann analysis yields the results : @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98    prospect studies have been performed at cdf , which indicate that with 1.5  @xmath8 , the single top could be observed at the @xmath99 level . on one hand",
    "these studies do not account for the systematic uncertainties which could delay the discovery by a few months . on the other hand ,",
    "they do not account for the possible improvements in analysis techniques . including a safety margin , we conclude that the evidence of single top production should be observed by the end of 2006 or 2007 at both cdf and d .",
    "if a @xmath100 generation heavy quark exists , it may show up just like the top quark , but with different kinematic properties . namely the events will be produced with higher reconstructed mass , and @xmath38 .",
    "cdf has searched for a heavy particle in the lepton+jets sample , selected from 760  @xmath7  of data , without the use of b - tag requirement .",
    "the discriminant quantities , @xmath101 and @xmath38 are reconstructed to probe for a possible heavy quark production .",
    "no excess is observed in the distribution of these variables , so that a limit is set on the @xmath102 mass .",

    "the events are selected in a lepton+jets sample and the invariant mass of the @xmath47 pair is reconstructed .",
    "no excess is observed by either d  in 370  @xmath7  or cdf in 680  @xmath7 , so that limit can be put on the resonant production . in a lepto - phobic top - color model",
    ", the heavy @xmath104 is excluded following @xmath105 @xmath106      a leptophobic @xmath5-like boson would show up as a resonance producing single top . to search for this kind of particle , d  employs the same techniques as for the sm single top : in the lepton+jets channel an ann is built to discriminate against both the @xmath47 background and the the @xmath5+jets background .",
    "the production of single top would be signed as a peak in the distribution of the reconstructed invariant mass , @xmath107 , of the selected events .",
    "as no excess is observed in the 230  @xmath7  of analyzed data , limits are set on the mass of the @xmath108 .",
    "@xmath109      in two higgs doublet models , five physical higgs bosons are predicted : 2 cp - even neutral , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , one cp - odd neutral , @xmath112 , and two charged , @xmath113,@xmath114 .",
    "the coupling of the charged higgs to fermions is a function of @xmath115 , the ratio of the vacuum expected values of the two doublets . at large or low @xmath115 the coupling to the top",
    "is large , so that the decay @xmath116 is allowed if @xmath113 is light enough .",

    "is preferred to use a more constrained model , such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) for which 2 parameters only describe the higgs sector at tree level , for example ( @xmath117 , @xmath115 ) .",
    "several benchmark scenarios are also well defined to probe the effects of the radiative corrections .",
    "cdf has conducted the search for charged higgs bosons by looking at the final state of @xmath122 production . for a given set of mssm parameters , the branching fractions such as @xmath123 @xmath124 or @xmath125",
    "are well defined .",
    "each point in the mssm parameter space predicts a given excess or deficit with respect to the sm expectations for the lepton+jets , di - leptons , single or double b - tag or @xmath126+jets channels . as no departure from the sm expectation",

    "an example of such a limit is shown in figure  [ fig : cdf_mssm_hplus_exclusion ] .",
    "a model independent limit can also be obtained as a function of only @xmath127 and the branching fraction @xmath128 .",
