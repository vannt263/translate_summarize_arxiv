    "[ intro ] helical springs are the basic structure elements used in many mechanical devices . in many applications ,",
    "it is important to optimize the geometric dimensions of the springs to reduce the amount of material used while maintaining the ability to support the required loads . optimal design of helical springs based on geometric programing is well - known for materials which obey hooke s law , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , materials subject to nonlinear stress - strain constitutive laws in this context have not been well - studied .",
    "one of the simplest nonlinear material constitutive law is the following power law @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the axial stress , @xmath2 the axial strain , @xmath3 the material constant - called the bulk modulus , and @xmath4 the power law index . materials which obey ( [ powerlaw ] ) are often called hollomon or ludwick materials in literature , see , e.g. @xcite and @xcite . high strength alloy metals such as heat treated metals , stainless steels , titanium alloys , and the super plastic - polyimide are the common examples of power law materials .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for a list of common metals with numerical values of the bulk modulus and the power law index .",
    "helical springs are mechanical devices made of a wire coiled in the form of a helix and considered to be a major element of shock absorber , return mechanisms , fuel flow controller used in engineering , automotive , medical and agricultural machinery .",
    "they are widely used for compressive loads . because even for small strains there is no obvious yield of the stress - strain curve for the power law materials before ultimate yield point",
    ", the linear theory or the traditional reduced modulus theory is not applicable or can not be accurately applied to calculate stress distributions .    in this work ,",
    "we first derive the maximum mechanical stress or loads and the corresponding tip - deflection under a compressive load , and then formulate the corresponding geometric programming problem minimizing the amount of material needed for the given loads .",
    "the optimal solutions of the geometric programming problem is studied by considering kktc conditions .",
    "the corresponding dual problem for the primal problem is constructed and examined for the solution as well .",
    "a numerical example is provided for both the prime and the dual problem .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the distance along a circular shaft from the fixed end under a uniform torque .",
    "we assume that the rotation at @xmath5 , denoted by @xmath6 , is proportional to @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the rate of twist .",
    "further , we assume that @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are the strains in polar coordinates . for the power law materials",
    ", we have the shear strain due to torsion @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the shear modulus and @xmath14 the poison s ratio .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the cross - section of the shaft , the total torque at @xmath5 is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the generalized area moment .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "assume that the angle between loading force at the tip of the spring and the plane containing the cross - section @xmath20 of the wire is negligible , then the torque acting on the wire @xmath21 and the average shear stress in the wire due to a vertical constant load , denoted by @xmath22 is @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the total stress at @xmath24 is approximately @xmath25 we now derive the deflection of the tip by extending the standard textbook method ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) for @xmath26 to the case of any value of @xmath4 .",
    "we first have @xmath27 which gives @xmath28 .",
    "then , we have @xmath29@xmath30 therefore , we have the tip deflection formula @xmath31",
    "the objective function of our optimization problem is the weight of a helical spring under axial load @xmath22 . as for the constraints",
    ", we consider only upper bounds on the shear stress in the cross - sections of the wire as described in the previous section and the tip deflection of the spring .",
    "first , define the design vector to be @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mean diameter of the coil and @xmath34 is the diameter of the wire as defined in the nomenclature .",
    "then , the objective function ( mass ) of the helical spring can be expressed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of turns in the spring and @xmath37 is the density of the spring material . from ( [ stress ] ) with @xmath38 ,",
    "the maximum stress for the power law helical spring is given by @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 is called spring index . by ( 3 ) , the expression for the maximum tip deflection of the helical spring is now @xmath43 where @xmath44 we now have the following nonlinear geometric programming problem for the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath22 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath36 : @xmath47 \\leq \\tau_{max}\\\\             & \\hspace{30pt}\\frac{(n+3)2^{n+3}}{8}\\frac{x_1 ^ 3 p n}{gx_2^{n+3 } } \\leq \\delta_{max }   \\\\             & \\hspace{88pt } x_2 \\leq x_1 \\end{array}\\ ] ] an examination of the kktc conditions of results in no solution .",
    "this is because the third constraint must be active i.e. @xmath48 , which is impossible in the context of the problem .",
    "therefore , a third constraint , which is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is added to complete the nonlinear program model .",
    "this is motivated by using the spring index equation @xmath51 in literature . with the new formulation of the problem our goal is to find optimal values of @xmath52.we have @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "notice that all coefficients are positive .",
    "to find optimal values of @xmath52 for the prime problem ( [ new_prime ] ) , we examine the kktc conditions as listed below : @xmath58 if @xmath59 , then from the first equation it follows that @xmath60 or / and @xmath61 are less than @xmath62 .",
    "hence , @xmath63 must be positive .",
    "+   +   +   + kktc conditions give @xmath64 from which @xmath65 is obtained .",
    "however , @xmath66 can not be zero ; therefore , this case results in no solution .",
    "+   +   +   + from kktc conditions we have @xmath67 this system , in general , has no solution since there are three equations and two unknowns .",
    "this case gives no solution , too .",
    "+   +   +   + we have the following system of equations @xmath68 this gives + @xmath69 @xmath70 + @xmath71 s and @xmath5 s are positive and satisfy non - negativity constraints . in this case ,",
    "inequality @xmath72 must also hold .",
    "that is , + @xmath73 + we must choose such constant @xmath74 that satisfies the above inequality and minimizes the objective function which becomes + @xmath75 + notice that minimization of the objective function is equivalent to minimization of @xmath74 .",
    "thus , for this case we choose minimum @xmath50 that satisfies  .",
    "+   +   +   + in this case kktc conditions result in the following system of equations @xmath76 from which we obtain + @xmath77 @xmath78 + @xmath71 s and @xmath5",
    "s satisfy non - negativity constraints .",
    "next , consider inequality @xmath79 + @xmath80 + notice that lhs of and are the same .",
    "+   + in this case , the objective function is + @xmath81 + again , minimization of the objective function is equivalent to minimization it relative to @xmath74 .",
    "now , we prove that if the following equation + @xmath82 + has a root @xmath83 then kktc conditions provide a desired solution .",
    "suppose that @xmath84 is a minimal root of that is greater than @xmath85 .",
    "assume that interval @xmath86 $ ] satisfies inequality , then there is no minimal value of @xmath74 that satisfies the following system of equations + @xmath87 therefore , case 3 does not give any solution .",
    "however , case 4 provides a solution because there exists a minimal value of @xmath74 of the following system of equations @xmath88 and that minimal value of @xmath74 is @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , if the interval @xmath89 $ ] satisfies inequality , then case 3 provides a solution . +   + we now show that solutions in both cases are the same . in other words ,",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath66 in case 3 are equal to @xmath90 and @xmath66 in case 4 , respectively .",
    "it is enough to show that @xmath66 s are the same .",
    "@xmath91 @xmath92 since @xmath66 s are equal , @xmath90 s and the values of objective functions in two cases are the same .",
    "this means that any solution of @xmath90 and @xmath66 can be chosen from case 3 or 4 .",
    "we denote the function @xmath93 by @xmath94 .",
    "the algorithm of finding optimal diameters and mass of helical spring can be stated as the following steps : _ step 1 _ : +   + solve numerically the inequality + @xmath95 + and choose a value of @xmath74 in the solution interval of the inequality that is larger than 1 ( see figure 2 ) , + _ step 2 _ : +   + calculate @xmath90 , @xmath66 and @xmath96 + @xmath97    it can be shown ( see also figure 2 ) that the equation @xmath98 has one negative root and one positive root that is greater than @xmath85 .",
    "this gives optimal design variables for and spring index @xmath99 in the range @xmath89 $ ] , where @xmath84 denotes the positive root .",
    "notice that we can again optimize the objective function relative to the spring index @xmath100 by choosing the design variables corresponding to the minimal weight .",
    "the algorithm of solving geometric programming problem by constructing its dual is well described in @xcite .",
    "we will follow that algorithm and show that the solution of the dual coincides with the solution of the primal problem . +   + first , rewrite the problem in the following way @xmath101 we now form the dual of the primal problem .",
    "remember that the maximum of the dual problem is equal to the minimum of the prime .",
    "hence , we have @xmath102 from the equations +   + @xmath103 + @xmath104 + @xmath105 +   + we obtain + @xmath106 + then , the objective function becomes @xmath107 in order to find maximum of @xmath108 we differentiate @xmath109 with repsect to @xmath110 and @xmath111 and solve the system of two equations .",
    "+ @xmath112 @xmath113 + from + @xmath114 + we obtain + @xmath115 + this gives + @xmath116 @xmath117 + notice that the above equation and are the same .",
    "+   + with the objective function becomes + @xmath118 + now , in order to find @xmath119 s we need to solve the following system of equations @xmath120 + with and the above system becomes + @xmath121 and as a solution we get + @xmath122 + we also need to check whether inequality constraints in are satisfied .",
    "that is , @xmath123 from the first equality in it follows + @xmath124 + then , from we obtain + @xmath125 + therefore , + @xmath126 + combining the second equality in and we have @xmath127 + the values of @xmath71 s can not be obtained from and they do not affect the solution .",
    "hence , we are free to set the values for @xmath71 s as long as they satisfy the constraints .",
    "+   + for @xmath110 choose any positive number that satisifies .",
    "then , gives + @xmath128 + from and it follows that @xmath129 and @xmath130 are positive .",
    "the solution and the objective function coincide with the solution in case 3 of the primal problem .",
    "remember that the solutions obtained from case 3 and 4 are the same .",
    "the coefficient @xmath74 is again found by solving the equation @xmath131",
    ". from one should not think that because we maximize @xmath108 we need to maximize @xmath74 . in the dual and primal problems @xmath74 is a coefficient and the value of which are free to set . from the solution of the dual we know that @xmath74 must satisfy .",
    "however , in order to choose the right @xmath74 one needs to look at the primal problem . in the context of the primal problem",
    "@xmath74 should be minimized i.e. must be the minimum positive root of which is greater than 1 .",
    "* problem : * formulate the problem of minimum weight design if a helical spring under axial load that is made of stainless steel .",
    "consider constraints on the shear stress and the deflection of the spring .",
