    "carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have been the subjects of intensive research in the area of nanotechnology for about 15 years @xcite , yet understanding of their fundamental physics is far from complete .",
    "one topic under intensive investigation is their electromagnetic response .",
    "early theoretical studies on cnts , modeled as infinitely long cylinders of a gas of electrons , showed the existence of gapless , low - frequency , plasmon branches @xcite .",
    "the low - frequency plasmon excitation along the nanotube axis lead to the formation of a electromagnetic surface wave @xcite .",
    "this surface wave strongly influences the scattering @xcite and radiation @xcite properties of a cnt in the terahertz regime .",
    "guided - wave propagation should therefore occur in a cnt bundle containing 2 @xmath0 1000 parallel cnts closely packed together .",
    "a guided wave could be formed by the plasmonic excitation in every cnt in the bundle and its characteristics would strongly depend on interactions between the cnts .",
    "two types of such interactions have been discussed in the literature :    \\(i ) the first type of interaction arises from the direct coupling of the electronic states in adjacent cnts due to overlap of their electron wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "the overlap is always very small for two reasons : ( a ) the contact area between two adjacent cnts is small due to their geometric curvature , even when the two touch each other ; and ( b ) the orbitals of the carbon atoms strongly overlap only in the plane of a graphene sheet , which leads to the known van der waals form of the integraphene sheet interaction .",
    "the momentum mismatch between the fermi points of neighboring cnts suppresses the inter - cnt tunneling and leads to strong localization of electronic eigenstates on individual cnts .",
    "therefore , there is no significant change of low - energy band structure in the vicinity of the fermi energy of a compositionally disordered metallic cnt bundle @xcite as compared with band structure of a single cnt .",
    "\\(ii ) the second type of interaction is an electrodynamic coupling in which coulomb interactions in a cnt are modified by the dielectric screening induced by the adjacent cnts .",
    "such dielectric screening has a significant effect in 1d structures ( such as single - wall cnts ) since many - body interactions are intrinsically strong in 1d geometry because much of the electric field of a charge on a cnt extends outside of the cnt .    a bundle of parallel cnts is generally considered as a 2d array of infinitely long cnts @xcite , thereby allowing the determination of the dispersion properties of a low - frequency plasmon in a 2d periodic medium .",
    "a realistic bundle of almost circular cross - section has a cross - sectional diameter much less than both its length and the electromagnetic wavelength in free space . in order to determine the scattering and radiation properties of a realistic cnt bundle",
    ", one needs to consider both the finite diameter and the length of the bundle .",
    "our aim in this paper is to analyze guided - wave propagation in an almost circular bundle of metallic cnts all of which are either infinitely long or have finite length .",
    "we neglect modifications of the low - energy band structure of cnts , but not the electromagnetic coupling of cnts in a bundle .",

    "@xcite , we assume that , in the low - frequency regime below optical interband transitions , the conductivity of metalic cnts is described by the electron - gas model , thereby leading to the cnt conductivity to follow the drude model .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in secs .",

    "these transitions contribute to the axial conductivity , but not to the transverse conductivity @xcite , and excite azimuthally symmetric electric current densities in the cnts @xcite . at frequencies far away from interband resonances , in practical terms , azimuthally nonsymmetric electric current densities are not excited in cnts because the relevant conductivities vanish . in detail , this peculiarity has been discussed elsewhere @xcite with application to surface - plasmon modes . in the remainder of this paper , therefore we restrict ourselves to azimuthally symmetric electric current densities in the cnts forming the bundle .",
