    "one recent exciting development in exoplanetary science has been the discovery of actively dying planets and asteroids .",
    "the main sequence stars koi  2700 , kic  12557548b , and k2 - 22 all contain planet candidates which are thought to be disintegrating due to dusty flows or tails @xcite . these systems harbour objects with orbital periods of , respectively , about 22 , 16 and 9 hours .",
    "the koi  1843 system contains a planet candidate which , although not yet observed to be disintegrating , is close enough to its star s disruption , or roche , radius , for a lower bound on its density to be set at 7 g @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this object s orbital period is only 4.245 hours .",
    "these four systems provide just a taste of the widespread disruption which is assumed to occur around stars which have left the main sequence . in particular , between one quarter and one half of all known milky way white dwarfs possess atmospheres which are `` polluted '' from the metal - rich remnants of shorn - up planetary systems @xcite .",
    "the elemental profile of the pollution provides unique insight into planet formation and bulk chemical composition @xcite , and accretion from dusty and sometimes gaseous debris discs likely gives rise to the pollution @xcite .",
    "the dynamical origin of these pollutants and their pathways through all stages of stellar evolution remains uncertain and represents a growing field of exploration @xcite .",
    "although the tidal disruption of asteroids which veer into the roche radius of the white dwarf has long been theorised to represent the dominant polluting mechanism @xcite , visual confirmation of this process was not supplied until the discovery of transiting bodies orbiting wd1145 + 017 @xcite .",
    "plentiful and ongoing follow - up observations of this system @xcite showcase complex dynamical signatures amongst at least six objects with orbital periods directly measured from photometric transit curves , sometimes with individual uncertainties as small as a few seconds . for main sequence stars , although co - orbital solid bodies have not yet been observed , an episode of catastrophic fragmentation might produce such bodies , leading to a similar architecture .",
    "such configurations raise fundamental questions about orbital dynamics , and about how mutual gravitational interactions may be linked to observations .",
    "exquisite orbital period measurements belie the otherwise starkly unconstrained state of such systems : unknowns include the size , mass and multiplicity of the co - orbiting objects ( henceforth referred to as just `` bodies '' ) , as well as the star s mass . for a system like wd 1145 + 017 , the size and mass of the bodies are unconstrained to within many orders of magnitude , whereas , because the star is a white dwarf , its mass is most likely to lie in the range @xmath5 ( e.g. fig . 1 of @xcite , and @xcite ) . regardless of these uncertainties",
    ", transit signatures strongly suggest that dust is emanating from the bodies , and roche radius computations ( e.g. based on equations and discussion from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) affirm that the bodies are highly likely to be currently disintegrating .    despite the unknowns , mutual interactions among the co - orbiting bodies",
    "can provide some theoretical constraints .",
    "these interactions will cause deviations in orbital period and ensuing accumulated phase shifts , both of which may be measurable . in this paper , we constrain the masses and multiplicities of co - orbital bodies in compact configurations by computing orbital period deviations with @xmath0-body numerical simulations .",
    "although we use wd1145 + 017 as inspiration , we do not attempt to specifically model this system because tidal disruption @xcite , interaction with the extant disc @xcite and rotational and orbital evolution due to white dwarf radiation @xcite all likely play a role .    instead , we perform simulations with an eye for future observations of similar systems around any type of star , in order to provide investigators with a basic notion of how orbital period deviations correspond to different architectures without complexities beyond point - mass gravitational dynamics . in section 2 , we briefly review co - orbital point mass dynamics with one central massive body .",
    "section 3 presents our simulation setup and section 4 displays our results .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "for nearly 250 years , researchers have attempted to understand how multiple objects may share the same orbit around a more massive primary ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a significant initial focus was the three - body problem , through which analytical stability formulae @xcite proved reliable after the discovery of trojan asteroids @xcite and the only known pair of co - orbital satellites , janus @xcite and epimetheus @xcite .",
    "the more complex @xmath0-body co - orbital problem with @xmath6 features a larger phase space , but has been studied primarily since the pioneering work of @xcite .",
    "he showed that in the limit of large @xmath0 and for low - enough masses , stable rings may be achieved . for finite @xmath0",
    ", however , even if the bodies are symmetrically spaced , predicting the stability of the system becomes nontrivial @xcite .",
    "effectively , the case @xmath6 requires numerical simulations unless the system in question can be linked to central configurations @xcite , a multi - body hierarchical restricted problem  which can be expressed entirely in terms of orbital element equations of motion ",
    "@xcite , or specialised symmetric cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "few- or many - body co - orbital dynamics may also be informed by the periodic orbits of the @xmath7 case @xcite .    the discovery of extrasolar planets @xcite prompted a resurgence of interest in the co - orbital problem . despite the absence of discoveries of trojan planets around main sequence stars",
    "( but see @xcite ) , the problem has received renewed attention in terms of planet formation and evolution @xcite , doppler radial velocity detections @xcite , and detections by transit photometry @xcite and binary eclipses @xcite .",
    "this work differs from all of the above investigations due to the heretofore unforeseen character of the transit observations of polluted white dwarfs with disintegrating bodies ( at least , as evidenced by wd1145 + 017 ) . because we have no reason to believe that the bodies should be symmetrically spaced ( see e.g. fig . 3 of @xcite and fig . 6 of @xcite )",

    "for our explorations , we use a slightly - modified version of the @xmath0-body code mercury @xcite .",

    "these modifications are likely overkill ; general relativity would advance the pericentre of circular co - orbital equal - mass bodies equally .",
    "further , during each orbit , general relativity would cause the bodies to incur a maximum inward ( non - cumulative ) drift of just about 4 - 6 km @xcite .",
    "we establish our initial conditions according to a scenario where @xmath11 co - orbital bodies each of mass @xmath12 orbit a star of mass @xmath13 . without loss of generality",
    ", we henceforth refer to the star as a white dwarf .",
    "the initial mutual orbit of the bodies is circular with semimajor axis @xmath14 .",
    "for each set of @xmath15 , we run over 100 simulations such that each one features bodies whose initial mean anomalies are drawn from a uniform random distribution .",
    "we run just enough simulations per set such that exactly 100 remain stable for the duration of five years ( we also keep and count the unstable simulations for later analysis ) .",
    "we output data every 0.25 day , and report orbital period variations after one week ( defined as seven days ) , one month ( defined as 30 days ) , one year ( defined as 365 days ) , two years , three years and five years .",
    "we sample all permutations of @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 kg . for the sake of adopting a stellar mass and period of the co - orbital body ,",
    "we adopt the values for wd 1145 + 017 , i.e. @xmath18 , and @xmath19 hours , as well as a value 25% larger ( @xmath20 hours ) .",
    "we note that the white dwarf mass in wd1145 + 017 is not yet accurately known , and that these parameters are equally illustrative for close - in planets at main sequence stars ( e.g. for koi 1843.03 , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 hours ; @xcite ) . for a given @xmath23 , the values of @xmath14",
    "change strictly according to what @xmath12 is being sampled .",
    "the value of @xmath3 kg represents a realistic upper bound for individual masses of co - orbital bodies which we might expect .",
    "planet - mass objects are rarely thought to enter the white dwarf roche radius @xcite , particularly for large planets @xcite .",
    "the probability , however , increases for asteroid - sized @xcite or moon - sized @xcite bodies , given the presence of eccentric planets @xcite ; comets enter the roche radius approximately once every @xmath24 years @xcite but are subject to quick evaporation @xcite .",
    "further , planets are complex multi - layered objects whose tidal disruption around main sequence stars @xcite implies that dedicated treatments would be necessary for white - dwarf - based studies .",
    "although all bodies in our simulations are treated with point mass dynamics , we give the white dwarf a finite fiducial radius of 8750 km in order to detect any potential collisions with bodies .",
    "as @xmath12 increases , we would expect instability to occur on a more frequent basis , and this instability can manifest as collisions between bodies , collisions between a body and the white dwarf , and ejections .",
    "we set the ejection radius at @xmath25 au , which represents a reasonable upper bound on each axis of the true hill ellipsoid of planetary systems in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "the duration of our simulations ( 5 yr ) ensures that no scattered object would actually have time to reach this edge , but this value allows any object on its way out to be retained and tracked .",
    "our simulations yield osculating values of each body s orbital elements , as well as indications about which have remained stable . of greatest interest",
    "is the osculating semimajor axis , which can be converted to orbital period , a direct observable in transiting systems .",
    "subsections 4.1 and 4.2 showcase the results for orbital period variations and instability , respectively .",
    "subsection 4.3 then assesses the applicability of these results to the wd 1145 + 017 system .",
    "each body varies its orbital period in a non - trivial manner due to the number and distribution of objects in each system .",
    "consequently , we rely on statistics to make gross characterisations . for an individual observed system ,",
    "if the phases of each object are known , then a more focused study may be carried out .",
    "such investigations may also consider bodies hidden from view which may significantly contribute to orbital period variations .",
    "we illustrate two examples of the nonuniformity of the orbital period variations in fig .",
    "[ linepl ] . both systems in the figure",
    "adopt @xmath26  where we have used the wd1145 + 017 system as a guide @xcite  but with different initial mean anomalies ( both randomly chosen sets of initial phases ) .",
    "the top panels show how the amplitude and other properties of these periods vary with time , so that the period variation is a function of observing baseline .",
    "the top panels also illustrate different behaviour from each other : the evolution in the right panel exhibits quicker amplitude changes from the left panel .",
    "the bottom two panels on each side of the figure are `` o - c '' ( observed - calculated ) diagrams .",
    "they illustrate how , for these two sets of parameters in particular , the times of the observed transit dips deviate from a linear dependence on orbital phase ( ephemeris ) .",
    "observations are more sensitive to relative phase shifts than the actual period variation , provided that individual transits are unambiguously identified over a sufficiently long baseline of observations .",
    "the middle and bottom panels , respectively , illustrate the deviations from linearity in transit time after six months and five years .",
    "the five - year cases represent the full baseline of simulations , whereas the six - month cases represent perhaps more realistic scenarios . in all four cases ,",
    "the deviations are large enough to be detected .",
    "the extent of the deviation can vary by a factor of three even though the initial phases are similarly clustered ( see figure caption ) .",
    "the matrix plots in fig .",
    "[ hist ] show how commonly systems with a given mass of co - orbiting bodies and time baseline achieve particular maximum period deviations .",
    "the colours indicate the magnitude of the number of systems out of 100 that achieve amplitudes in a range whose maximum extent was found to be 0.7 seconds ( upper panel , for @xmath27 kg ) , 7 seconds ( middle panel , for @xmath28 kg ) and 141 seconds ( lower panel , for @xmath29 kg )",
    ". there does not exist one necessarily representative distribution ( or colour scheme ) for all sets of @xmath30 .",
    "outliers are the result of special configurations of multi - body co - orbital problems , such as @xmath31 offsets for the much simpler @xmath32 case under the guise of the restricted three - body problem .    in aggregate ,",
    "however , over the entire phase space there exist clear trends , which are displayed in fig .",
    "that figure is particularly important because it effectively bounds the masses from above and below with the bottom and top sets of curves .",
    "these sets correspond to the minimum and maximum period deviations obtained in any of the stable simulations that were run ; the middle curves display the standard deviation .    from these curves , also note ( i ) the clear upward trend in orbital period variation as a function of @xmath12 , ( ii ) the slight increase in maximum deviation values for the larger @xmath23 value ( right panels ) , and ( iii ) the upper and middle sets of curves in each plot are largely insensitive to the sampling timescale , unlike the lower curves .",
    "this trend may be inferred from fig.[linepl ] .     and",
    "@xmath3 kg respectively kept the systems stable .",
    "consequently , in general terms , instability does not provide as robust a bound on the masses as does the maximum and minimum period deviations ( fig .",
    "[ key ] ) . , width=302,height=226 ]      one potential constraint on the upper mass bound of bodies is system stability .",
    "although instability may come in the form of engulfments within the star , bodies being perturbed on a course out of the system , or collisions amongst bodies , only the last possibility occurred in our simulations .",
    "the likely reason is because any close encounters between the bodies , given their masses , could not have generated the speed needed to eventually escape the system .",
    "further , co - orbital circular configurations are geometrically unfavoured to produce ejections or engulfments within the parent star .",
    "therefore , even if we had instead adopted a stellar radius that was commensurate with a small main sequence star , engulfments would still not have been likely to occur unless the co - orbital bodies were large enough to be affected by star - planet tides .    there does not exist a particular critical body mass at which a system would go unstable because stability is a function of both @xmath11 and @xmath12 for a fixed number of orbits .",
    "nevertheless , the probability of instability increases as both @xmath11 and @xmath12 do , as demonstrated by fig .",
    "the plot makes clear predictions that instability should occur under the 5% , 10% and 20% level for @xmath33 and @xmath3 kg .",
    "regarding bounding body masses from observations , these constraints are weak compared to those obtained from orbital period deviations .",
    "finally , we note that collisions amongst bodies might be observable .",
    "the result will be a reduced value of @xmath11 , and a change in orbital period variations . in this scenario , however , the masses of the remaining co - orbital bodies are no longer likely to be equal , and consequently a more detailed analysis would be required .      as suggested in the introduction ,",
    "the wd 1145 + 017 system is too complex to be modelled by the architecture and masses that we have adopted here .",
    "nevertheless , one interesting comparison can be made : typical orbital period deviations that are reported in this study for @xmath28 kg are roughly a few seconds ( fig .",
    "[ key ] ) .",
    "@xcite deduced that an asteroid mass of this order of magnitude can , through fragmentation , produce bodies which settle into an orbit whose period deviates from the original orbit by about 27 seconds .",
    "this larger , observed , deviation in wd 1145 + 017 may easily be explained by effects not accounted for here , which include ( i ) the orbiting objects are probably of different mass , ( ii ) the process of fragmentation , ( iii ) the known presence of dust , and ( iv ) the known presence of gas .",
    "multiple co - orbital bodies near or inside of a stellar roche radius might provide unique insights into a system s violent history . for white dwarfs ,",
    "these bodies provide a glimpse into how debris discs are formed and how white dwarf atmospheres are polluted .",
    "the mutual perturbations amongst the bodies generate slight variations in orbital periods ( @xmath34 s ) and phase shifts over the course of weeks , months or years , which are detectable by current instruments . here",
    ", we have quantified this variation as a function of mass , multiplicity , distance and time sampling ( fig .",
    "[ key ] ) and show that for a given orbital period deviation , lower and upper mass bounds may be estimated .",
    "we also characterised the fuzzy instability boundary ( fig .",
    "[ inst ] ) , which provides an upper bound on the incidence of instability for a given co - orbital body mass .",
