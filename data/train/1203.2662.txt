    "in @xcite affine polar spaces are derived from polar spaces the same way as affine spaces are derived from projective spaces , i.e. by deleting a hyperplane from a polar space embedded into a projective space .",
    "so , affine polar spaces ( apses , in short ) are embeddable in affine spaces and this let us think of them as of suitable reducts of affine spaces .",
    "in general we have two types of affine polar spaces .",
    "structures of the first type are associated with polar spaces determined by sesquilinear forms ; one can loosely say : these are  stereographical projections of quadrics \" .",
    "they can also be thought of as determined by sesquilinear forms defined on vector spaces which represent respective affine spaces .",
    "these structures and adjacency of their subspaces were studied in @xcite .",
    "contrary to @xcite , in this approach minkowskian geometry is not excluded .",
    "in particular , the result of @xcite generalizes alexandrov - zeeman theorems originally concerning adjacency _ of points _ of an affine polar space ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the second class of affine polar spaces , which is included in @xcite but is excluded from @xcite , consists of structures associated with polar spaces determined by symplectic polarities .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present in some detail the geometry of the structures in this class from view of the affine space in which they are embedded .",
    "the position of the class of thus obtained structures ",
    "let us call them symplectic affine polar spaces  is in many points a particular one .",
    "firstly , symplectic affine polar spaces are associated with null - systems , quite well known polarities in projective spaces with all points selfconjugate .",
    "so , symplectic apses have famous parents .",
    "moreover , in each even - dimensional pappian projective space such a ( projectively unique ) polarity exists .",
    "thus a symplectic aps is not an exceptional space , but conversely , it is also a  canonical \" one in each admissible dimension .",
    "a second argument refers to the position of the class of symplectic apses in the class of all apses . as an affine polar space",
    "is obtained by deleting a hyperplane from a polar space , while the latter is realized as a quadric in a metric projective space , the derived aps appears as a fragment of the derived affine space . if the underlying form that determines the polar space is symmetric then the corresponding aps can be realized _ on _ an affine space in one case only  when the deleted hyperplane is a tangent one .",
    "and then the affine space in question is constructed _ not _ as a reduct of the surrounding projective space but as a derived space as it is done in the context of chain geometry ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , such an aps can be represented without the whole machinery of polar spaces : it is the structure of isotropic lines of a metric affine space .",
    "the only case when the point set of the reduct of a polar space _ is _ the point set of an affine space arises when we start from a null system i.e. in the case considered in the paper .",
    "but such an aps is not associated with a metric affine space i.e with a vector space endowed with a nondegenerate bilinear symmetric form . what is a natural analytic way in which a symplectic aps can be represented , when its point set is represented via a vector space ?",
    "a way to do so is proposed in our paper : to this aim we consider a `` metric '' , a binary scalar - valued operation defined on vectors .",
    "it is not a metric , in particular , it is not symmetric , and it is not invariant under affine translations .",
    "nevertheless , it suffices to characterize respective geometry .",
    "symplectic apses have famous parents but they have also remarkable relatives . although the `` metric '' : the analytical characteristic invariant of symplectic apses is not a form , it is closely related to forms . loosely speaking ,",
    "it is a sum of an alternating form @xmath8 defined on a subspace and an affine vector atlas defined on a vector complement of the domain of @xmath8 .",
    "immediate generalization with ` an alternating map ' substituted in place of ` an alternating form ' comes to mind . such a definition of a map may seem artificial , the resulting maps , which we call _ semiforms _ , have quite nice synthetic characterization though .",
    "their basic properties are established in section  [ sec : semiforms ] .",
    "a symplectic ` metric ' appears to be merely a special instance of such a general definition and many problems concerning it ( so as to mention a characterization of the automorphism group ) can be solved in this general setting easier . to illustrate and to motivate such a general definition we show in [ exm : prod ] a semiform associated with a vector product , that yields also an interesting geometry . on the other hand , this geometry has close connections ( see ) with a class of hyperbolic polar spaces .",
    "a semiform induces an incidence geometry that we call an _ _ ( cf . and ) .",
    "it is a @xmath9-space with affine spaces as its singular subspaces ( cf .",
    "[ thm : gamma ] ) , and with generalized null - systems comprised by lines and planes through a fixed point ( cf .",
    "[ lem : geowiazki:0 ] ; comp . a class with similar properties considered in @xcite ) .",
    "in the paper we do not go any deeper into details of neither geometry of semiforms nor geometries other than symplectic apses .",
    "we rather concentrate on `` apses and around '' .    finally , we pass to our third group of arguments : that geometry of symplectic apses is interesting on its own right .",
    "geometry of affine polar spaces is , by definition , an incidence geometry i.e. an aps is ( as it was defined both in @xcite and @xcite ) a partial linear space : a structure with points and lines . from the results of @xcite we get that geometry of symplectic affine polar spaces can be also formulated in terms of binary collinearity of points ",
    "an analogue of the alexandrov - zeeman theorem . a characterization of apses as suitable graphs is not known , though .",
    "the affine polar spaces associated with metric affine spaces ( as it was sketched above ) can be , in a natural consequence , characterized in the `` metric '' language of line orthogonality or equidistance relation inherited from the underlying metric affine structure .",
    "it is impossible to investigate a line orthogonality imposed on an affine structure so as it gives rise to a symplectic aps .",
    "however , in case of a symplectic aps a `` metric '' mentioned above determines an `` equidistance '' relation which can be used as a primitive notion to characterize the geometry .",
    "there is no general commonly accepted axiom system of a weak equidistance relation ( of a congruence of segments , in other words ) .",
    "a very natural one , that characterizes metric affine spaces is presented in @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , in accordance with that approach a congruence of segments is an equivalence relation on pairs of points such that bisector hyperplanes are really affine hyperplanes .",
    "but these properties are met by our `` symplectic equidistance '' as well .",
    "the difference is that a segment and its translate need not be congruent under our equidistance . in this paper",
    "we do not intend to give a characterization of symplectic apses in the language of equidistance .",
    "nevertheless , we think it is worth to stress on that this is also a possible language for this geometry and to indicate similarities and dissimilarities between our equidistance and that used in metric affine geometry .",
    "since our equidistance is not commutative we have two types of bisectors ( cf . ) and thus two types of symmetry under a hyperplane ( cf .",
    "[ thm : symmetry ] ) .",
    "the first type of a relation of being symmetric wrt .",
    "a hyperplane is related to translations and the other type is a central symmetry .",
    "recall that the affine space @xmath10 defined over a vector space @xmath11 has the vectors of @xmath11 as its points and the cosets of the @xmath12-dimensional subspaces of @xmath11 as its lines .",
    "we write @xmath13 for the ( affine ) translation on the vector @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be a vector space over a ( commutative ) field @xmath17 with characteristic @xmath18 and let @xmath19 be a nondegenerate bilinear reflexive form defined on @xmath16 .",
    "assume that the form @xmath19 has finite index @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we will write @xmath22 for the class of all vector subspaces of @xmath16 and @xmath23 for the class of all @xmath24-dimensional subspaces . in the projective space @xmath25",
    "the form @xmath19 determines the polarity @xmath26 .",

    "the structure    @xmath30    is referred to as the _ polar space _ determined by @xmath31 in @xmath32 .",
    "this section may look superfluous from view of symplectic polar spaces but it is used later in an example which justifies our general construction of semiforms .",
    "now let @xmath19 be symmetric and @xmath33 be the orthogonality determined by @xmath19 on @xmath34 .",
    "set @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37\\in y\\colon u\\perp v\\}$ ] .",

    "also @xcite ) .",
    "now let @xmath44 be a maximal ( i.e. a @xmath45-dimensional ) singular subspace of a hyperbolic polar space @xmath46 of index @xmath47 and let @xmath48 be the structure obtained by deleting the subspace @xmath44 from @xmath46 . in particular we write @xmath49 .",
