    "the study of spin asymmetries in the production of heavy quarkonium states in polarized nucleon - nucleon collisions should provide important information about the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "heavy quark - antiquark production processes occur at small distances and the subprocess level cross sections can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "on one hand , charmonium production asymmetries are expected to be sensitive to the polarized gluon distribution function in the proton , since heavy quark systems are mainly produced in gluon - gluon fusion subprocesses . on the other hand ,",
    "it is essential to investigate in more detail the heavy quark - antiquark pair hadronization phase . to this end ,",
    "observation of charmonium production in experiments with polarized beams is expected to provide additional tests for existing models .",
    "the factorization approach ( fa ) based on the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) turns out to be a most rigorous framework to study heavy quarkonium production and deacy processes @xcite . according to the fa",
    "the inclusive production cross section for a quarkonium state @xmath6 in the process @xmath7 can be factorized as @xmath8 where the short - distance coefficients , @xmath9 , are associated with the production of the heavy quark pair in the color and angular momentum state @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "this part of the production cross section involves only momenta of the order of the heavy quark mass and larger and can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "the heavy quark - antiquark pair production process occurs at small distances , @xmath11 , and is factorized from the hadronization phase which takes place at large distances , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the heavy quark mass . here",
    "@xmath14 is the average velocity of heavy constituents in the quarkonium , with @xmath15 for charmonium and @xmath16 for bottomonium systems .",
    "the vacuum matrix elements of nrqcd operators , @xmath17 @xcite , describe the evolution of the quark - antiquark state @xmath10 $ ] into the final hadronic state @xmath6 .",
    "these matrix elements can not be calculated perturbatively , but the relative importance of long distance matrix elements in powers of velocity @xmath14 can be estimated using the nrqcd velocity scaling rules @xcite .",
    "this formalism implies that quark - antiquark color octet intermediate states are allowed to contribute to heavy quarkonium production and decay processes at higher order in the velocity expansion .",
    "therefore , in the fa the complete structure of the quarkonium fock space is taken into account while in the old approach , in the color singlet model ( csm ) @xcite , only the dominant fock state is considered , which consists of a color singlet quark - antiquark pair in a definite angular - momentum state of the final hadron ( the leading term in the velocity expansion ) .",
    "the predicted shape of the @xmath18 distribution of the @xmath19 intermediate octet state production cross section indicates that @xmath20 and @xmath21 production at large @xmath18 observed at the tevatron ( fnal ) can be explained in the fa @xcite .",
    "recent investigations have shown that the contribution of color octet states to the charmonium production cross section is very important at fixed target energies , @xmath22 gev , and reduces existing discrepancies between experimental data and predictions of the csm @xcite .    despite the obvious successes of the nrqcd in explaining large @xmath18 charmonium production at the tevatron , some experimental data contradict the color octet model ( com ) predictions .",
    "in particular , theoretical predictions disagree with measurements of the polarization of @xmath20 and @xmath21 particles produced at fixed target energies @xcite and the com prediction for the yield ratio of @xmath3 and @xmath4 states remains too low @xcite .",
    "one possible solution for these discrepancies was proposed by brodsky et al .",
    "@xcite suggesting that higher twist processes , when more than one parton from projectile or target participate in the reaction , might give a significant contribution to low @xmath18 production of @xmath20 and @xmath3 states .",
    "problems exist also in charmonium photoproduction at hera .",
    "the color octet contribution underestimates the inelastic @xmath20 photoproduction cross section at large values of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 in the laboratory frame ) @xcite .    unlike the color singlet long distance matrix elements ,",
    "each connected with the subsequent hadronic non - relativistic wave function at the origin , color octet long distance matrix elements are unknown and have to be extracted from experimental data .",
    "the nrqcd factorization approach implies universality , i.e. the values of long distance matrix elements extracted from different experimental data sets must be the same .",
    "however , due to the presently rather large theoretical uncertainties @xcite and the unknown size of higher twist process contributions @xcite the existing experimental data does not allow to check the fa universality , yet .",
    "this fact motivated us to look for other processes with less theoretical uncertainties to test the com .",
    "the observation of spin asymmetries in the production of charmonium states can be used for these purposes @xcite as well as measurements of the @xmath20 polarization in unpolarized hadron - hadron collisions and electroproduction @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we consider double spin asymmetries in @xmath0-wave charmonium production at non - zero @xmath18 in the nrqcd factorization approach .",
    "the double spin asymmetry in @xmath20 hadroproduction has been studied recently taking into account color octet intermediate states @xcite .",
    "the asymmetries in the production of @xmath25 states at small @xmath18 were considered in refs .",
    "as already mentioned above , at small values of @xmath18 large contributions from higher twist effects are expected @xcite and the presently available theoretical predictions are not reliable enough to allow extraction of information about polarized parton distributions or to check the com .",
    "morii et al .",
    "considered asymmetries in the production of @xmath25 states at rhic energies taking into account only fragmentation type contributions for color octet intermediate states @xcite . however , since the cross section for the production of charmonium states falls steeply with increasing @xmath18 the statistical errors becomes too large at those values of @xmath18 where the fragmentation approach can be applied , especially at at small energies @xmath26 gev .",
    "in contrast to this approach , our calculations @xcite use the exact expressions for the cross sections of intermediate color octet states in different helicity states of the initial partons , to estimate the expected spin asymmetries in the production of @xmath25 states as well as the projected errors .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section subprocess level asymmetries for possible intermediate octet and singlet states and corresponding long - distance color octet parameters",
    "are considered . in section",
    "3 numerical results are presented for spin asymmetries in production of @xmath25 states at hera-@xmath2 @xcite , one of the future options of hera ; an experiment using an internal polarized nucleon target in a possibly later polarized hera beam at @xmath1 gev . for comparison",
    ", we also consider the expected asymmetries in the production of @xmath25 states in similar spin physics experiments at the rhic collider @xcite at @xmath5 gev .",
    "the two - spin asymmetry @xmath27 for inclusive @xmath25 production is defined as @xmath28 where the subscript in @xmath29 indicates the sign of the helicity projection onto the direction of the proton .",
    "the production of each quarkonium state receives contributions from both color octet and color singlet states . in leading order @xmath30",
    "only one color octet state contributes to the production of @xmath25 states , namely @xmath19 . unlike direct @xmath20 production , leading color octet and color singlet contributions to p - wave charmonium production scale equally in @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and the subleading corrections are only of the order @xmath32 . to calculate the production asymmetries only leading order color octet contribution",
    "are taken into account .",
    "we consider the production of @xmath33 states at non - zero values of transverse momentum , @xmath34 gev .",
    "the leading contribution to the production of charmonium states at those values of transverse momentum comes from the @xmath35 subprocesses .",
    "the leading order subprocesses , @xmath36 , should not contribute to the quarkonium production with @xmath34 gev because these transverse momenta can not be caused by internal motion of partons in the nucleon .",
    "the contribution of higher twist processes @xcite is also expected to be small at @xmath34 gev .    for the calculation of the expected asymmetries for color octet and singlet states of a @xmath37-pair we consider the following subprocesses : @xmath38 the asymmetries for all these subprocesses",
    "were calculated in ref .",
    "the values of those giving a significant contribution to the production of @xmath25 states are presented in fig . 1 in dependence on the two dimensionless quantities @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the charm quark mass , @xmath42 the c.m .",
    "energy in the parton - parton system , and @xmath43 is the maximum momentum of the produced state in the subprocess .",
    "figure 1 shows only the gluon - gluon fusion subprocess asymmetries because they give the main contribution to the hadron level asymmetry .",
    "the color singlet long distance matrix elements are connected to quarkonia wave functions at the origin : @xmath44 this value was used in @xcite for fitting the cdf data on @xmath20 production through @xmath25 states and corresponds to the buchmller - tye type potential solution tabulated in @xcite . for the color octet long distance matrix element",
    "the following value extracted from cdf data was used @xcite : @xmath45    l7.5 cm    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the variation of the renormalization and/or the factorization should lead to large uncertainties when fitting the color octet parameters .",
    "the fit results for long distance color octet matrix elements can be affected also by higher @xmath30 corrections ( so called ` trigger bias ' effect ) @xcite .",
    "therefore care is required when using at fixed target energies the value for this parameter extracted from cdf .",
    "the influence of these uncertainties on the expected asymmetries will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the characteristic value of the partonic @xmath46 in the production of @xmath37 pairs can be obtained from the relation @xmath47 ( @xmath48 at hera-@xmath2 ) .",
    "this means that the typical value of @xmath49 that can be probed by measuring the spin asymmetry in charmonium production is about @xmath50 .",
    "we used three different sets of gehrmann and stirling ( gs ) parametrizations @xcite for polarized parton distribution functions ( pdf ) that are different in the region @xmath51 to show the sensitivity of the spin asymmetries in the production of @xmath25 states on the gluon polarization in the nucleon : the sets a and b of the nlo gs parameterization and the lo parameterization set a. in fig .",
    "2 the polarized gluon densities from these parametrizations are shown at @xmath52 gev@xmath53 , which is the appropriate value in the kinematical region considered . as can be seen , the three chosen sets exhibit somewhat different values for the polarized gluon distribution function at partonic @xmath46 values around @xmath54 .",
    "we note that , although the calculations of subprocess level cross sections are performed in leading order , the nlo set of the parametrization was used to probe different shapes of the polarized gluon distribution .",
    "3 and 4 show the expected production asymmetries for @xmath25 states at @xmath55 gev ( hera-@xmath2 ) .",
    "figures 3a and 3b also include projected statistical uncertainties on the asymmetry @xmath56 , estimated at hera-@xmath2 from @xcite by @xmath57 where @xmath58 efficiency is assumed .",
    "this relation is based upon an integrated luminosity of @xmath59 and beam and target polarizations of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the error bars are obtained by using integrated cross sections over bins @xmath62 gev ( for the first three points ) and @xmath63 gev ( for the other two ones ) .",
    "note that it is easier to measure asymmetries for @xmath3 and @xmath4 states due to their large branching ratios for decays into @xmath20 plus photon ( @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 ) .",
    "these branching ratios and the @xmath20 decay branching ratios into @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) are taken into account in the calculations of the projected statistical errors for the production of @xmath3 and @xmath4 states . due to the small branching ratio of the @xmath70 decay through @xmath20 , @xmath71 , the projected statistical errors of an asymmetry measurement for this state are too large .    in figs . 3 and 4 , the asymmetries for set a and set b of the nlo gs parametrization",
    "are represented by solid and dashed lines , respectively , whereas the dash - dotted lines correspond to set a of the lo parametrization .",
    "the asymmetries coming only from color singlet intermediate states expected for the set a of nlo gs parametrization are additionally shown in figs . 3 and 4 by dotted lines .",
    "note that for the set c of the nlo gs parametrization all asymmetries are less than @xmath72 and practically unobservable , hence they are not shown .",
    "for the mass of the charm quark the value @xmath73 gev was taken and the parton distribution functions are evaluated on the factorization scale @xmath74 .",
    "the strong coupling constant is calculated by the one - loop formula with 4 active flavors ( @xmath75 mev ) .    in all three parameterizations for the polarized parton distribution functions the gluon - gluon fusion process gives the dominant contribution to @xmath76 in the kinematical region considered .",
    "the quark - gluon subprocesses contribute only to about @xmath77 ( for both color octet and color singlet states ) and the contribution of quark - antiquark annihilation subprocesses is less than @xmath72 .",
    "l7.5 cm    the contribution of the color octet @xmath19 state does practically not change the @xmath3 production asymmetry coming from the color singlet intermediate state . for @xmath70 ,",
    "the influence of the octet contribution becomes larger with increasing @xmath18 . as seen from fig .  1 ,",
    "the asymmetries for color singlet @xmath78 and color octet @xmath19 states have different sign . by this reason",
    "the color octet contribution , compared to the color singlet one , changes the asymmetry of the @xmath4 state more than in the case of @xmath70 and @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , due to the ` trigger bias ' effect the corresponding color octet long distance matrix element may be approximately two times larger and hence the contribution of the color octet states to the asymmetries may even increase .    in the  inclusive  case",
    "the  kinematics of  the  @xmath35 subprocess can not be reconstructed completely .",
    "hence only indirect information on the gluon polarization of the nucleon can be obtained by measuring the spin asymmetry in inclusive @xmath25 production . as can be seen from figs .",
    "3 and 4 , the expected asymmetries for all @xmath79 states strongly depend on the size of the polarized gluon distribution function in the region @xmath80 . at",
    "the size of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 asymmetries compared to the projected statistical errors will allow to draw conclusions on the polarized gluon distribution function .",
    "in addition , the measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath4 asymmetries provides a good opportunity to discriminate between two possible mechanisms of heavy quarkonium production : the nrqcd factorization approach and the color evaporation model ( cem ) @xcite . as can be seen from fig .",
    "3b , the @xmath4 production asymmetry is negative at smaller values of transverse momentum where the gluon - gluon fusion subprocess contribution to @xmath76 is dominant . in spite of the positive contribution of the color octet state @xmath19 to @xmath76 ,",
    "the @xmath4 production asymmetry remains negative as in the csm , i.e. in the nrqcd approach the double spin asymmetries for @xmath3 and @xmath4 states have different sign .",
    "in contrast , in the cem the asymmetries for all charmonium states are expected to be the same .",
    "such a comparison is possible even when shape and size of the polarized gluon distribution in the proton are not yet known .",
    "the only requirement is that the gluon polarization is large enough to generate observable @xmath3 and @xmath4 asymmetries .    for comparison",
    "we have also calculated the expected double - spin asymmetries for the production of @xmath3 and @xmath4 states at rhic energies .",
    "the results are given in fig .",
    "5 for the c.m.s .",
    "energy @xmath5 gev .",
    "the statistical errors are calculated with the anticipated integrated luminosity of @xmath81 @xmath82 assumming @xmath58 efficiency and @xmath83 . as can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "3 and fig . 5 ,",
    "the expected asymmetries decrease with increasing c.m.s .",
    "energy for a given parameterization of polarized parton distribution functions .",
    "moreover , the anticipated integrated luminosities at hera-@xmath2 and rhic lead to a smaller discrimination power at higher energy .",
    "one of the main parameters of the factorization approach is the mass of the charm quark .",
    "as in the case of @xmath20 production @xcite , the expected asymmetries for @xmath25 states are practically insensitive to the value of the charm quark mass . therefore , the double spin asymmetry in @xmath25 production , unlike the cross section , should be free from uncertainties caused by the unknown mass of intermediate color octet states .",
    "moreover , the asymmetries do not strongly depend on the renormalization scale , unlike the production cross sections @xcite . the effects of intrinsic transverse momentum smearing on the asymmetries in the production of charmonium states were also investigated .",
    "such an effect is very important for the cross section of @xmath20 photoproduction at hera collider energies @xcite , however its influence to asymmetries is far below the size of the projected statistical errors shown in figs . 3 and 5 .",
    "double spin asymmetries expected in hadroproduction of heavy quarkonium @xmath0-wave states in polarized proton - proton collisions were investigated . to reduce the contribution from possible higher twist corrections @xcite the production of @xmath25 mesons was considred at non - zero transverse momenta , @xmath34 gev unlike the calculations of @xcite , where only the lowest order subprocesses @xmath36 were taken into account .",
    "the size of the expected asymmetries in conjunction with the projected statistical uncertainties at hera-@xmath2 ( @xmath1 gev ) will allow to distinguish between different parametrizations for polarized parton distribution functions , specifically between the nlo gs sets a and b @xcite . at rhic ,",
    "higher than hitherto planned integrated luminosities would be required to do so .",
    "the asymmetries for the production of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states in the transverse momentum range @xmath84 gev exhibit different signs in the nrqcd factorization approach .",
    "in contrast to this , the color evaporation model predicts identical double spin asymmetries for all charmonium states . this should allow to discriminate between these different mechanisms of heavy quarkonia production if the gluon polarization is sufficiently large and @xmath79 asymmetries become observable .      * * g.t .",
