    "the theoretical proposal and numerical observation of time - reversal breaking lattice models exhibiting fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) phases , reviewed in refs .  , have sparked intense interest in these models ( `` fractional chern insulators '' or fcis ) as a promising venue for observing fqh physics without the need for large external magnetic fields .",
    "the majority of our theoretical understanding of the the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) has been framed in the context of continuum landau levels , which occupy a special and highly atypical point in the space of all single - particle hamiltonians .",
    "it is a matter of both theoretical and experimental interest to identify which of the special properties of landau levels ( lls ) are essential to the existence of the fqhe : as fcis rapidly move towards experimental reality , one would like to easily identify experimental parameters where fqh - like phases are most robust .",
    "relevant to these aims are several recent studies investigating the role of the algebra of band - projected density operators in an fci in shaping the excitation spectrum of fqh phases  @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , these results point to a role for band geometry , i.e. , _ non_-topological properties of chern bands , in determining the stability of fqh states in fcis ; in particular , the fubini - study metric describing the embedding of the occupied bands in the hilbert space of all bands appears naturally when one considers a long - wavelength expansion of this operator algebra @xcite .",
    "that reference gave qualitative arguments linking properties of this algebra with the stability of fqh - like states which were numerically investigated in @xcite .",
    "the results obtained there suffered from the limitation that underlying band geometry could only be varied indirectly ; moreover , one would like to be able to unify these numerical examples with a theoretical picture capable of making analytic statements .    for these reasons , in this article",
    "we investigate the conditions proposed in @xcite in the context of the hofstadter model @xcite .",
    "this provides an ideal laboratory for studying the interplay between band geometry and fqh physics , due to the fact that it offers a controlled limit ( that of vanishing flux per plaquette ) which converges to continuum lls , which offer optimal conditions for fqh states ( in a sense to be made precise below ) and allows us to obtain analytic results not possible for generic fcis .",
    "we note that , although the hofstadter model involves a net magnetic flux , numerical studies @xcite have shown its fqh states may be adiabatically connected to those in fcis with no net flux .",
    "a significant literature on the fqhe in the hofstadter model exists @xcite .",
    "the hofstadter model is also a subject of ongoing experimental work : hostadter bands have recently been realized with cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite and in graphene superlattices @xcite .    in what follows ,",
    "we show that the band - geometric criteria proposed in @xcite meaningfully quantify the stability of fqh phases as one perturbs the band geometry of the hofstadter model away from the continuum limit .",
    "we show that momentum - space fluctuations of the berry curvature and fubini - study metric have exponential convergence to their ll limit , while a third , nontrivial condition related to the averaged trace of the fubini - study metric has slower , polynomial convergence .",
    "numerical exact diagonalization studies of several different fqh states show that the many - body gap depends monotonically on this third criterion , even when momentum - space fluctuations are negligible .",
    "this constitutes strong evidence that the band geometry plays a key role in the stability of the fqhe in settings where lattice effects are important .      in this section and",
    "the next , we present the background material necessary to formulate our hypothesis for the stability of fqh - like states in the hofstadter model and fix notational conventions which will be used in subsequent calculations .    in momentum space , we write the band hamiltonian of a lattice model as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 indexes the bands",

    "( in a refinement of previous arguments @xcite ) . these are that ( i ) the berry curvature is constant over the bz , ( ii ) all components of the quantum metric are constant over the bz , and ( iii ) the following quantity @xmath17 vanishes everywhere , i.e. the metric determinant inequality is saturated . in ref",
    ".   a similar inequality involving the trace of the metric @xmath18 was proved , and it was shown that @xmath19 automatically implies @xmath20 .    conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) were not chosen arbitrarily : the main result of ref .",
    "is that they are sufficient to guarantee that the set of band - projected density operators in an fci is closed under commutation , and obeys a generalization of the girvin - macdonald - platzman algebra @xcite arising in the continuum fqhe .",
    "density - density interactions are essential to the stability of any fqh phase , so the more accurately the algebra is reproduced ( specifically , as measured by the conditions ) , the more stable fqh - like phases should be : we refer to this as the `` band geometry hypothesis . ''",
    "the validity of the band geometry hypothesis has been tested for a variety of fqh - like phases appearing in several different fci models in @xcite .",
