    "the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) has now been estimated up to redshifts @xmath8 5 . by combining the evolution of the 2800 luminosity density calculated from cfrs - galaxies ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ) at redshifts @xmath9 1 , and the 1500   luminosity density calculated from high redshift galaxies ( @xmath10 2 ) in the hdf found by the lyman dropout techniques , madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argue that the sfr should peak at 1 @xmath11 2 .",
    "complementary to these , connolly et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have used hdf photometric measurements , together with ground based near - ir photometry , to derive the 2800   luminosity density at redshifts 0.5 @xmath11 2 .",
    "these results are in good agreement in the region overlapping with the cfrs , supporting the case of a peak in the sfr .",
    "this conclusion is , however , sensitive to the fact that the rest frame light may have been strongly attenuated by dust .",
    "absorption by dust is especially severe for the uv - light , and since shorter rest frame wavelengths are sampled at higher @xmath12 , this uncertainty increases with redshift .",
    "the evolution of the sfr is reflected in the cosmic supernova rate ( snr ) .",
    "it should therefore , in principle , be possible to use supernova ( from now on sn ) observations to distinguish between various star formation scenarios .",
    "even more important , core collapse sne , i.e. types ii and ib / c , provide a direct probe of the metallicity production with cosmic epoch . in reality",
    "these relations are non - trivial to establish .",
    "when it comes to core collapse sne , the observational constraints at high redshifts are nearly non - existent . even at low redshift",
    "the statistics are severely affected by selection effects .",
    "a main problem comes from the fact that core collapse sne observationally show a large diversity , both in terms of luminosities and types , and with uncertain distributions .",
    "in addition , dust absorption , as well as background contamination , affect the statistics .",
    "nevertheless , because of their importance for the nucleosynthesis , as well as galaxy formation , direct observations of the rate of core collapse sne are of high interest .",
    "it is therefore hardly surprising that this is one of the main goals for the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) ( stockman 1997 ) .    for type ia sne ,",
    "the unknown time delay between formation and explosion of the progenitors unties the link to the sfr , making predictions more model dependent .",
    "observations of the type ia rate at high redshift therefore provides a possibility to distinguish different progenitor scenarios .    in this paper",
    "we present estimates for the expected number of observable sne for the ngst , as well as for ground based instruments , and discuss various complications entering the analysis .",

    "our work differs in that we include information about the light curve , as well as spectral evolution , which allow us to predict the simultaneously observable number of sne .",
    "that this is important is obvious from the fact that a nearby sn seen at the tail of the light curve is indistinguishable from a more distant object at the peak .",
    "we divide the sne into different types with maximum absolute magnitudes and spectral distributions that varies with time and type .",
    "this also introduces a large dispersion in magnitudes at a given redshift .",
    "neglect of these effects introduces a severe malmquist bias .",
    "we calculate the counts for different broad band filters , and include information about the expected redshift distribution of the detected sne .",

    "we use a filter that we denote by m@xmath16 , which is centered on @xmath15 = 4.2 @xmath6 m with @xmath17 = 3 . for the magnitudes we use the ab - system where m@xmath4 = -2.5@xmath18 - 48.6 ( oke & gunn 1983 ) ( @xmath19 in ergs @xmath20 hz@xmath21 s@xmath21 ) . here",

    "a problem when using uv - luminosity densities to calculate the sfr is that these can be matched to almost any sfr , ranging from a strongly peaked to a flat , or even increasing , sfr at @xmath23 1 , by adjusting the assumed extinction due to dust . by simultaneously using luminosity densities observed in different wavebands it is possible to break this degeneracy .",
    "madau ( 1998 ) used three bands ( uv , optical and nir ) in order to derive a sfr that can simultaneously reproduce the evolution of the different luminosity densities .",

    "4 we discuss alternative sfr s .",
    "core collapse sne , which originate from short lived massive stars ( ages @xmath26 yrs ) , have an evolution that closely follows the shape of the sfr .",
    "assuming an immediate conversion of these stars to sne renders a multiplicative factor , @xmath27 = snr / sfr , between the sfr ( @xmath28yr@xmath29mpc@xmath30 ) and the snr ( yr@xmath29mpc@xmath30 ) , where @xmath27 depends on the imf and the mass range of the progenitors . here , we take @xmath31 using a salpeter imf yields @xmath27=0.0064 .",
    "note that , for consistency , the same imf as assumed when deriving the sfr from the luminosity densities should to be used . using a scalo imf , instead of a salpeter imf ,",
    "decreases the conversion factor @xmath27 between the sfr and the snr by a factor 2.6 .",
    "a scalo imf , however , also increases the sfr as derived from the uv luminosities by a factor @xmath7 2 , hence cancelling most of the effect .",
    "the reason is that the same stars that produce the uv luminosities also explode as core collapse sne .",
    "the lower mass limit for type ii progenitors is generally believed to be 8 - 11 @xmath32 ( e.g. , timmes et al .",
    "1996 ) . here",
    "we choose 8 @xmath32 , a limit supported by e.g. , nomoto ( 1984 ) .",
    "an increase to 11 @xmath32 would decrease @xmath27 , and hence the snr , by @xmath7 38% .",
    "indications from especially the oxygen / iron ratio that the most heavy stars form black holes and do not result in sne , justifies the use of 50 @xmath32 as an upper limit to the progenitor mass ( tsujimoto et al .",
    "other studies ( e.g. , timmes et al .",

    "an upper limit of 30 @xmath32 , instead of 50 @xmath32 , decreases @xmath27 by @xmath7 9% .",
    "the uncertainties concerning the origin of type ia sne makes the relation between the rate of these sne and the star formation more ambiguous .",

    "( 1996 ) argue that the sne ia progenitor lifetime is probably restricted to 0.5 - 3 gyr .",
    "this range opens a possible way to observationally distinguish between progenitor models .",
    "ruiz - lapuente & canal ( 1998 ) find that the more short - lived double - degenerate progenitor systems and the long - lived cataclysmic - like systems should yield significantly different rates .",
    "in this paper we use as a standard model the sfrs derived by madau ( 1998 ) to calculate the rates of both core collapse and type ia sne .",

    "this is also true for the scenario with flat high-@xmath12 sfr and low extinction , but the increase is modest , and it does not start before @xmath5 1.5 as an illustration , fig .",

    "including the full range of @xmath60 and different star formation scenarios , the ngst should detect between 5 - 25 type ia sne per field in the k@xmath16 band .",
    "for the ground based limit , i@xmath4 = 27 , the number of type ia sne increases by a factor 1.4 - 1.9 for the high dust scenario , and a factor 1.0 - 1.8 for the low dust scenario with flat sfr ( smaller increase for lower values of @xmath60 ) .",
    "if @xmath60 is long , stars formed at early cosmological epochs may survive until low redshifts before ending as type ia sne . therefore , the increased star formation at high redshifts in the two constant sfr models makes the rate of type ia sne sensitive to the assumed formation redshift , @xmath56 .",

    "for example , with @xmath60 = 1 gyr the high-@xmath12 cutoff in the type ia rate occurs at @xmath5 2.5 for the two models with flat sfr and @xmath56 = 5 ( see fig . [ fig7 ] ) . with @xmath56 = 7 and @xmath56 = 10 the cutoff in the rates moves to @xmath5 3.0 and @xmath5 3.4 , respectively . this effect is larger for smaller values of @xmath60 .    as earlier mentioned , a further possibility that may increase the predicted counts of core collapse sne is if the first sne and their progenitors sweep away the dust , making the extinction lower for a large fraction of the sne relative to the stars that produce the uv luminosity .",
    "we have studied this scenario by simply neglecting the extinction of the sne in the two models with @xmath24 = 0.1 ( not included in table [ table3 ] ) .",
    "the main difference occurs for the optical bands , where the effect of a lower extinction is largest . in",

    "i.e. reaching beyond the peak region , the differences decrease because a majority of all sne is detected in both models , despite the different amount of absorption . for k@xmath22 = 31.4",
    "the increase is therefore only @xmath7 10% .",
    "besides the standard flat @xmath14 = 1 cosmology ( scdm ) used so far , we have also studied two additional cosmologies ; one open cosmology ( ocdm ) with @xmath14 = 0.3 and @xmath65 = 0 , and one flat , @xmath66-dominated cosmology ( @xmath66cdm ) with @xmath14 = 0.3 and @xmath65 = 0.7 .",
    "the most obvious effect of a different cosmology comes from the luminosity distance , @xmath40 ( eq .",
    "changing from scdm to ocdm and @xmath66cdm increases the distance modulus , making the high-@xmath12 sne fainter ( eqs . 4 & 5 ) , as seen in fig .",
    "the increased distance modulus in the ocdm and @xmath66cdm cosmologies also affects the intrinsic star formation rates used .",
    "a larger distance modulus implies an increase in the absolute magnitudes of the galaxies from which the star formation rate , and hence also the supernova rates , are derived . as expected , these two effects , i.e fainter apparent sne and an increased snr , almost cancel when it comes to the observed number of core collapse sne per square angle .",
    "the cosmology also affects the volume element , given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the proper motion distance , @xmath68 = ( 1+@xmath69 .",
    "the luminosity distance , @xmath40 , is given by eq .",
    "the change in volume element affects the snrs when expressed in units number of sne per mpc@xmath70 per yr .",
    "it does not , however , change the estimated rates of observed core collapse sne expressed in number of sne per square angle .",
    "this is due to the fact that the core collapse snr is directly proportional the observed luminosity density of galaxies , which is calculated from the number of galaxies per redshift interval for a specific angle over the sky , an observational quantity independent of cosmology .",
    "when it comes to the type ia sne , the volume element enters the calculations since the time between the formation of the progenitor star and the explosion of the sn may be a significant fraction of the hubble time .",
    "this dependency on cosmology increases as the delay time @xmath60 increases .",
    "the general trend is an increased snr for the alternative cosmologies at high redshift .",

    "it is , however , necessary to reach faint magnitudes ( k@xmath72 28 ) to observe this increase in the total rates .",
    "note , however , that a type ia at peak magnitude has m @xmath7 25 at @xmath5 1 .",
    "this means that using sne seen at peak allows probing of the region where the rates start to differ between the cosmological models at more moderate limiting magnitudes .",
    "ruiz - lapuente & canal ( 1998 ) discuss the use of type ia s to distinguish between different cosmologies . in sect .",
    "8 we comment on their results .",
    "the increased type ia rates at high @xmath12 for the alternative cosmologies means that the redshift cutoff moves to higher redshifts .",
    "this cutoff is also highly dependent on the delay time @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is , however , somewhat less dependent on the sfr .",
    "therefore , if @xmath60 is known , it should be possible to constrain the cosmology , even if the sfr is not accurately known . as an illustration , including all sfr scenarios , and using @xmath60 = 1 gyr ( @xmath60 = 3 gyr ) , results in a cutoff in the type ia rates at @xmath12 2.5 - 3.5 ( 1.2 - 1.5 ) for the scdm cosmology , while the drop is at @xmath12 2.9- 4.9 ( 1.6 - 2.2 ) and @xmath12 3.2 - 5.3 ( 1.9 - 2.6 ) for the ocdm and @xmath66cdm cosmologies , respectively .",
    "the higher values in these redshift ranges correspond to the hierarchical star formation scenario .",
    "in a recent paper marri & ferrara ( 1998 ) study the effects of gravitational lensing ( gl ) on high-@xmath12 objects , in particular type ii sne , for a hierarchical model of galaxy formation .",
    "for the three flat cosmologies they study ( scdm with @xmath14 = 1 , lcdm with @xmath14 = 0.4 , @xmath65 = 0.6 and chdm with @xmath14 = 0.7 , @xmath73 = 0.3 ) , they find that there is at least a 10% chance that objects with @xmath74 4 are magnified by a factor @xmath58 3 . to estimate the effects of gl on our results we have therefore used their magnification probabilities on our model ( i.e. their figs . 4 and 5 ) .    for the scdm model , which yields the highest magnification , we find that the increase in the total number of core collapse sne is only a few percent when using the ngst limits ( m@xmath22 = 30.2 and k@xmath22 = 31.4 )",
    ". the effects are even smaller for the shorter wavelength bands .",
    "the reason for the small effect is that with the faint limits of the ngst almost all sne up to @xmath0 4 are detected even without magnification , and that the number of sne with even higher @xmath12 , where the magnification has largest effect , is relatively small .",
    "more interesting , for sne with @xmath754 we find , when using the ngst m@xmath16 limit , an increase by @xmath7 20% of the predicted counts .",
    "for sne with @xmath71 9 the increase is @xmath7 40% .",
    "it should , however , be noted that estimates presented by porciani & madau ( 1998 ) give a much lower probability for substantial magnification compared to the marri & ferrara results used in the estimates above .",
    "the reason for this seems to be that marri & ferrara assume point - like lenses , whereas porciani & madau use a more realistic mass distribution characterized by singular isothermal spheres .",
    "therefore , the effects of gravitational lensing presented here could be overestimated .",
    "a major problem when comparing predictions from different scenarios to observations is the determination of the sn redshift .",
    "a direct spectroscopic determination with a resolution of @xmath58 100 is only possible for sne more than two magnitudes brighter that the limiting magnitude , i.e. i@xmath76 25 for @xmath77 m class telescopes and k@xmath78 28.5 for the ngst . to reach fainter magnitudes",
    "the main alternative is photometric redshifts of either the host galaxy or the sn .",
    "photometric redshifts for galaxies have been discussed extensively by e.g. , fernndez - soto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , yee et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , gwyn ( 1995 ) and connolly et al .",
    "the fact that a large fraction of the star formation up to @xmath71 1 occurs in dwarf galaxies , as well as the cosmological dimming , can make such a determination difficult .",
    "an alternative is to estimate a photometric redshift directly from the sn .",
    "a problem here is that the sn spectrum changes with both type and epoch .    to examine this possibility",
    "we have determined broad band colors for the different types of sne as function of epoch and redshift . as an example",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] the color indices for a type iip sn as function of redshift at different phases .",
    "the spectra are taken from the synthetic spectra calculated by eastman et al .",
    "these spectra assume lte , but may nevertheless give a good impression of the qualitative evolution .",
    "at early time , before @xmath7 20 days the spectrum is a fairly smooth blackbody without a strong uv cutoff .",
    "the color indices do therefore not change dramatically with redshift . at later stages in the plateau",
    "phase the spectrum does not change much .",
    "an important aspect is that the uv cutoff at @xmath7 4000   has now developed to its full extent , and the uv is essentially black .",
    "this is probably the most useful feature for identifying high redshift sne photometrically .",
    "the extent of this uv drop may , as we discuss below , depend on the metallicity .",
    "the uv cutoff has a very pronounced effect on the optical color indices at @xmath9 1 , with strong increases in the b - i , v - i and r - i indices at successively larger @xmath12 . for @xmath2 1 the j - i and k - i , and finally k - j , are most useful due to the essential disappearance of the sne in the optical .",
    "a problem with photometric redshifts of sne , compared to galaxies , is that the colors , as we have seen , depend sensitively on the epoch .",
    "in addition , they depend on sn type .",
    "e.g. , type iil s have less uv blanketing , while the type ia s have a rapid development of the uv cutoff . to break this strong degeneracy",
    "it is essential to have information about both sn type and epoch .",
    "it is therefore necessary to obtain reasonable light curves , i.e. a fairly large number , @xmath58 5 - 10 , observations of the field . a complete analysis",
    "can therefore be quite costly in terms of observing time .",
    "an alternative redshift method may be to use reasonably well sampled light curves in combination with the cosmic time dilation . for",
    "type ia sne one can safely assume a standard light curve .",
    "although the absolute luminosity can vary by a large factor , type iip s have a fairly well defined duration of the plateau phase , which lasts @xmath7 100 days .",
    "also type iil s and ib s and ic s have reasonably standardized light curves . from the observed light curve one can then , at least for sne with @xmath71 1 , get an approximate redshift within @xmath7 25% from a comparison with the low @xmath12 light curve templates .",
    "however , since the light curve should be followed over a decline of about @xmath7 2 magnitudes in order to achieve a type specific light curve , the gain in depth by using photometry instead of multi object spectroscopy is marginal .",
    "the photometric accuracy also decreases for these levels and the actual limit may be even higher than two magnitudes .",
    "therefore , in practice little is probably gained compared to direct spectroscopy .",
    "a major source of uncertainty is the treatment of dust extinction . in sect .",
    "4 we showed how different assumptions about the dust extinction affect the estimated rates .",
    "an underlying assumption in each of the calculations is that the same amount of dust affects the uv - luminosity from the high-@xmath12 galaxies ( used to calculate the snr ) and the light from the sne .",
    "if the uv - luminosity originates from regions with dust properties that differ considerably from the regions where the sne originates , an extra dispersion in the estimated rates should be expected .",
    "it is , however , difficult to estimate the uncertainties in the rates introduced by this , since the distribution of the dust within the galaxies at high @xmath12 is poorly known .",
    "other sources of uncertainties are the range of progenitor masses in eq .",
    "( 2 ) and the choice of imf ( sect .",

    "which also affect the core collapse sne , the rates of type ia s depend strongly on the assumed progenitor scenario , and are more dependent on cosmology .",
    "also , the normalization at @xmath12 = 0 introduces an additional uncertainty by a factor @xmath7 3 . considering this",
    ", it seems unlikely that counts of type ia s can be used to set any constraints on the model parameters . with additional information about the redshift distribution of the sne it should , however ,",

    "one of these parameters must , however , be independently determined , since there is a degeneracy between the both when it comes to the estimated redshift distribution of the sne . to decrease the uncertainties involved , well defined searches of sne at low redshift are highly desirable .      with increasing redshift the mean metallicity decreases , although the dispersion may be higher that at present .",
    "it is therefore interesting to discuss the consequences of a lower general metallicity .    for type ia sne , kobayashi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) argue that for one of the most likely progenitor scenarios , based on super - soft x - ray binaries , the necessary condition for a chandrasekhar mass explosion may not occur for a metallicity of @xmath81 0.1 @xmath82 , consistent with the decrease in the galactic [ fe / o ] ratio at this metallicity . the physical reason can be traced to the peak in the opacity curve at @xmath7 10@xmath83 k , produced by iron . in the scenario by kobayashi et al . , this corresponds to a drop in the type ia rate at @xmath0 1.2 . at higher",
    "redshifts type ia explosions are inhibited , since [ fe / h ] @xmath84 - 1 here . including the possibility of a dispersion in the evolution of the metallicity leads kobayashi et al . to conclude that a cutoff in type ia rates should occur at @xmath12 = @xmath85 .",
    "the kobayashi et al .",
    "scenario should observationally be similar to the @xmath60 = 3 gyr model , with a turn - on at @xmath5 1.5 . because the life time in their model is @xmath60 = 0.6 gyr",

    "sne a lower metallicity can have several effects .",
    "first , line blanketing in the uv may decrease somewhat for the type iip s .",
    "since this is mainly an ionization effect , rather than an abundance effect , it is , however , likely that this effect is small .",
    "this is partly confirmed by the calculations by eastman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who find only a marginal decrease of the uv blanketing as the metallicity is decreased from solar to a tenth of solar .",
    "for extremely low metallicity , like for pop .",
    "iii stars with @xmath81 10@xmath86 , blanketing may , however , decrease significantly , although the balmer jump will still be present .",
    "secondly , the relative fraction between different sn types may change .",
    "in particular , the number of blue , compact supergiant progenitors similar to sanduleak -69@xmath87 202 may increase .",
    "this would then lead to a larger fraction of faint sn1987a like sne , decreasing the number of observable core collapse sne at high @xmath12 .",
    "we emphasize that the exact reason for the blue progenitor of sn1987a is not fully understood ( e.g. , woosley et al . 1999 ) .",
    "finally , the mass loss process of the sn progenitor may depend on the metallicity .",
    "an example is the known decrease of the mass loss rate with decreasing metallicity for radiatively accelerated winds ( e.g. , kudritzki et al .",
    "in the red supergiant phase dust driven mass loss may be less efficient ( salasnich et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the importance of binary mass transfer may also depend on the metallicity .",
    "a change in the mass loss rate with metallicity would change the relative proportions between the different core collapse types .",
    "in particular , a decrease of the total mass lost is expected to lead to a decrease in the number of type iil , ib and ic sne , while favoring type iip s .",
    "in addition , a less dense circumstellar medium medium could then lead to a decrease in the ionization by the circumstellar interaction , and stronger line blanketing for the type iil and iin s .",
    "note , however , that the mass loss process even for local red supergiants in their final phase is poorly understood .      with large ground - based telescopes , and especially with ngst",
    ", it should be possible to detect sne up to high redshifts , and to estimate the rates of both core collapse and type ia sne .",
    "we have shown that because the rate of core collapse sne follows the sfr , it should be possible to use observed rates of these sne to constrain the sfr . as we have seen , a major problem is the influence of dust extinction . in this respect",
    "we note that the nir bands have the advantage of being less affected by dust extinction than the observed uv - luminosities . at high redshifts",
    "these bands correspond to the optical rest wavelength bands , and have therefore a factor of @xmath88 lower extinction than the uv bands .",
    "different star formation models may therefore better be tested by using the k and m bands .",
    "reaching high redshifts ( @xmath2 2 ) , corresponding to k@xmath89 27 , increases the differences in the predicted counts between the star formation models significantly ( see sect .",
    "the estimated difference in the redshift - integrated counts between the hierarchical star formation model and the high dust star formation model is a factor @xmath58 2 .",
    "this is about the same factor produced by the uncertainties in the modeling .",
    "it is therefore difficult to use these counts to probe star formation scenarios , unless the parameters involved are better known .",
    "what seems more feasible is to use redshift subsamples to constrain the shape of the sfr . as shown in sect .",
    "4.3 , for models with a flat sfr at high @xmath12 , we estimate a factor @xmath7 @xmath90 more sne with @xmath2 4 .",
    "a major problem here is to determine the redshifts of the sne ( see discussion in sect . 7 ) .",
    "a further problem is if a large fraction of the star formation takes place in galaxies with very large extinction , like m 82 or abell 220 with @xmath91 magnitudes ( instead of @xmath92 , as for our high dust model ) .",
    "the difference between the optical and uv extinction is then of less importance , leading to a decrease in the estimated differences between the models .",
    "a similar large extinction may be indicated by the results of the iso observations of some deep fields ( e.g. , flores et .",
    "far - ir observations is then the most reliable way of deriving the true star formation rate .",
    "an alternative is to use some other source tightly coupled to star formation , but not affected by dust absorption .",
    "if gamma - ray bursts are related to some class of core collapse sne ( e.g. , type ic s ) , they may be such class of objects ( cen 1998 ) .",
    "also radio observations may be interesting in this respect .",
    "the study of the nucleosynthesis by direct observation of sne is naturally affected by the same problem as the star formation rate . unless the dust extinction can be determined reliably in an independent manner ,",
    "the true number of sne is difficult to derive .",
    "in addition to this , the metallicity yields for sne of different masses is non - trivial to derive even at low redshifts ( e.g. , fransson & kozma 1999 ) . only for sn 1987a and a couple of other sne",
    "has this become possible .",
    "the alternative to use theoretical yields from collapse calculations is obviously less satisfactory .",
    "the lower metallicity may also affect e.g. the mass loss processes , as discussed in sect .",
    "this may change both the progenitor structure and the upper and lower limits for the core collapse and type ia sne , as well as the heavy element yields . in our view one of the most interesting goals for the observation of sne at high redshift may be to observationally study the differences between the sne in the early universe and those today .",
    "an important aspect concerning the detection of sne is the spacing in time between the observations . in order to detect the sn",
    ", the magnitude has to change appreciably .",
    "the interval is primarily dependent on the shape of the light curve . near the peak ,",
    "where the sn changes relatively fast , a comparatively short time is sufficient .",
    "this applies to searches where detection of sne on the rising part of the light curve is the main objective ( e.g. , searches for type ia s for @xmath93 ) .",
    "core collapse sne , which have a flatter decline of the light curve , need a longer spacing .",
    "this is especially true for the type iip s , which in the plateau phase decline by @xmath84 1 mag . unless a sn can be detected ( against the host galaxy ) with this precision",
    "it will be missed .",
    "the limiting magnitude of the search also affects the necessary spacing . a deeper search results in a higher mean @xmath12 of the observed sne .",
    "due to the cosmic time dilatation , the light curves of these sne are stretched in time , implying that a longer interval between two observations is needed , @xmath7 100(1 + @xmath12 ) days .",
    "therefore , in order to detect these sne a deep observation with the vlt requires an interval of @xmath58 100 days , while a corresponding ngst observation requires approximately a years interval .",

    "( 1996 ) , madau et al .",
    "( 1998a ) and chugai et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which we have already commented on , there is a number of related investigations .",
    "marri & ferrara ( 1998 ) have studied of the effects of gravitational lensing of high redshift sne . using a press - schechter formalism and gravitational ray - tracing , they determine the magnification probability as function of redshift for different cosmologies .",
    "we have already discussed the implications of their lensing results for our simulations in sect .",
    "marri & ferrara use these magnification probabilities to estimate the observed magnitudes at high redshift .",
    "the fact that there is a relatively large probability , @xmath58 10% for a factor of three or larger magnification for @xmath94 4 , means that even sne as distant as @xmath5 10 may be within the limits of ngst . when estimating the observed magnitudes they , however , assume that the light curve is described by a type iip light curve without any dispersion in magnitude ,",
    "although as we have seen , the type iip s show a very large variation in luminosity .",
    "they also assume a fairly high temperature , @xmath7 25000 k during the first 15 days , which is twice as high as the models by eastman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) give .",
    "this is especially important for the high-@xmath12 sne , and , as marri & ferrara show , a lower temperature makes the detectability considerably more difficult .",

    "the effects of gravitational lensing is also investigated by porciani & madau ( 1998 ) .",
    "they find , as earlier mentioned , a considerably lower probability for a substantial magnification than marri & ferrara do .",
    "porciani & madau present i band counts for type ia and core collapse sne , both including gl , and without lensing .",
    "these counts are presented as the number of sne in different magnitude bins ( 21 @xmath95 i@xmath96 27 ) , seen at the peak of the light curve for an effective observation duration of one year .",
    "this leads to lower estimates for the observable number of sne compared to our estimates , where we include sne detected over the whole light curve . to compare our results",
    "we have calculated counts in the same units as used by porciani & madau .",
    "we find a fairly good agreement between the core collapse counts ( deviation by a factor @xmath7 2 ) , but a somewhat worse agreement between the type ia counts .",
    "it should be noted that expressing rates in units of an effective observation duration requires an idealized observational procedure ( as we have shown in the examples in sect .",
    "ruiz - lapeunte & canal ( 1998 ) discuss the possibility of using r band counts of type ia sne to distinguish different progenitor scenarios .",
    "they find , similar to our estimates , that models with long - lived progenitors result in higher counts than models with short - lived progenitors . to use this as a probe they note that it is necessary to know the sfr better than a factor 1.5 .",
    "however , the uncertainty in the sfr seems , as we have shown , to be larger than this .",
    "it should therefore be difficult to use counts to determine progenitor scenarios .",
    "additional information about the redshift distribution of the sne is required .",
    "the same authors also estimate the effects on the counts for alternative cosmologies .",
    "they find that a flat @xmath66-dominated universe ( @xmath66cdm ) should result in higher counts of type ia sne than a standard cold dark matter universe ( scdm ) .",
    "the difference between the cosmologies start at m@xmath97 24 , and increases at fainter limiting magnitudes . a somewhat smaller increase in the counts",
    "is found for an open universe with zero cosmological constant ( ocdm ) .",
    "our results for different cosmologies agree with the general trend of ruiz - lapeunte & canal . using counts to distinguish between cosmologies",

    "however , the metallicity used by miralda - escud & rees may be overestimated by an order of magnitude ( songaila 1997 ) , leading to an overestimate of the snr by the same amount .",
    "also , the redshift before which the metallicity is assumed to have been produced affects the comparison .",
    "using @xmath0 3 , instead of @xmath0 5 , decreases the estimated number sne given by miralda - escud & rees by @xmath7 30% .",
    "more important , integrating our rates for redshifts above @xmath12 = 3 , instead of @xmath12 = 5 as done above , results in a number of sne that is a factor @xmath7 4 higher . other uncertainties in the estimate by miralda - escud & rees include the actual fraction of the baryonic matter which is enriched by the sne .",
    "miralda - escud & rees limit their discussion to type iip sne , and do not attempt a detailed discussion of the observed rates .",
    "the observed magnitudes compare fairly well with our magnitudes in the k and m bands , but are brighter in the optical and near - ir bands . the main reasons for this",
    "is that they use a higher effective temperature and that they do not take into account any line blanketing in the uv , as our models do .",
    "as we discuss in next section , the low metallicity may decrease this effect .",

    "these rates ( their fig .",
    "3 ) agree better with our estimates at low redshifts . at high redshifts",

    "jrgensen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) attempt a calculation of the absolute rates of type ia , ii and ib sne from a population model .",
    "although in principle appealing , this model depends on the uncertain scenarios for the progenitors of especially the type ia s , as we have already discussed in this paper .",
    "any estimates will therefore be sensitive to these assumptions .",
    "they also neglect the distinction between type iip s and type iil s , which most likely originate from different progenitors .",
    "further , jrgensen et al . assume in the calculation of the observed magnitudes in the different bands as function of redshift , that the spectrum is characterized by that at the peak .",
    "as we have discussed , the spectrum and luminosity vary strongly with time .",
    "the most serious deficiency is in our view their neglect of the magnitude variation , as given by the light curve , which as we have seen , changes the observed rates by large factors .",
    "their estimates of the observed rates are therefore highly questionable .",
    "observations of high redshift sne are of interest for several reasons . first of all , one has through these a direct probe of the nucleosynthesis and star formation of the universe . in practice , there are several obstacles for a quantitative study of these issues .",
    "the fact that a large fraction of the star formation , and thus the sne , may be hidden within optically thick dust can make it difficult to determine the total sfr and snr accurately .",
    "this is certainly true for the optical bands , where we have found that the predicted total number of core collapse sne with @xmath9 1.5 is rather insensitive to the assumed star formation scenario , as long as the star formation is calculated to match the same observed luminosity densities , and the same extinction is assumed for the uv light from the galaxies and the sne .",
    "observations in the near - ir are less affected by this , and offers a clear advantage to the observations of the far - uv , as used for lyman break objects . however ,",
    "if a large fraction of the star formation occurs in highly obscured star burst galaxies , also the near - ir rates are severely affected .",
    "a further advantage of using sne as star formation indicators is that they are insensitive to surface brightness selection effects .",
    "a complication when it comes to studying the nucleosynthesis is that the yields of the supernovae may vary with metallicity .",
    "an important motivation for searches of sne at high redshift is that one can from this type of observations learn something about the sne themselves when observed in a different environment . in particular , differences in the fractions of the various core collapse subclasses , their spectra and luminosities may give new insight into the physics of the sne and their progenitors .",
    "the number of core collapse sne that can be detected with ngst , with its expected limiting magnitude k@xmath102 = 31.4 , should be @xmath7 45 per field in a 10@xmath103 s exposure , assuming a hierarchical star formation scenario .",
    "the mean redshift of these sne is @xmath104 = 1.9 .",
    "about one third of the sne have @xmath2 2 .",
    "the high dust model results in total counts in the k@xmath102 band that are a factor @xmath7 2 higher than in the hierarchical model .",
    "the estimated number of sne with @xmath2 2 in the k@xmath102 band for ngst is a factor @xmath7 3 higher than in the hierarchical model . the model with flat sfr at high @xmath12 , but with low extinction , result in a factor @xmath7 2 higher number of sne with @xmath2 2 , compared to the hierarchical model , for the ngst limit .",
    "an important practical point is that in order to detect especially the type iip sne at high @xmath12 it is necessary to have a spacing between observations of @xmath7 100 days for ground based telescopes , and @xmath7 1 year for deep observations with ngst .",
    "shorter time intervals do not allow for the luminosity of the sne to decrease by an amount necessary for detection .",
    "when it comes to the observed rates of type ia sne , we find that these are highly sensitive to the star formation modeling .",
    "this is due to the fact that the type ia s are less linked to the environment where their progenitors were formed .",
    "the uncertainty in the life - time of the progenitors , combined with the sensitivity of the type ia rates to the onset of star formation in the models with a flat sfr at high @xmath12 , contributes to the difficulty with using type ia counts as probes for either different star formation scenarios or progenitor models .",
    "this is further hampered by the fact that even the local rate is highly uncertain , and that this propagates to other redshifts through the normalization of the rates at @xmath12 = 0 .",
    "therefore , accurate measurements of the type ia rates at low @xmath12 are most desired .",
    "precise measurements of the type ia rates at @xmath2 1 could constrain the parameters to some extent .",
    "for example , in a given cosmology there is a high redshift cutoff in the ia rates at an epoch that depends strongly on @xmath60 , but is less dependent on the star formation scenario . in agreement with previous studies",
    "we find that counts of type ia sne can be used as cosmological probes .",
    "this does , however , require that both the sfr and the unknown life time of the type ia progenitors can be determined independently .",
    "we predict the number of simultaneously detectable type ia sne per ngst field to be @xmath7 @xmath105 , depending on progenitor model and star formation scenario .",
    "additional uncertainties widen this range even more . of the simultaneously observable type ia sne ,",
    "about 5% are on the rising part of the light curve . for a ground based telescopes with limiting magnitude i@xmath76 27",
    "we predict @xmath106 type ia s per square degree of which @xmath7 30% are on the rise of the light curve .",
    "a major technical aspect of our work is that we have tried to incorporate as much knowledge as possible about the theoretical and observational properties of the different classes of sne .",
    "in particular , we have found that the spectral evolution is important for the magnitudes in the different bands .",
    "a striking example is the sensitivity to the uv cutoff , which for most sne dominate the evolution in the optical bands .",
    "we have also found that a proper treatment of the light curve can change the predicted rates by factors of three or larger .",
    "an important source of uncertainty in these estimates are the local frequencies of sne of different classes , as well as their distribution in luminosity .",
    "more extensive surveys with well defined selection criteria are therefore of highest priority for reliable predictions at high redshifts .",

    "<S> a major problem is the determination of the redshift of these faint supernovae , and various alternatives are discussed , including photometric redshifts . in practice a reliable classification based on either spectroscopy or light curves </S>",
    "<S> requires the sne to be @xmath7 2 magnitudes above the detection limit . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties in the estimates are discussed extensively . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how the estimated rates depend on cosmology . </S>",
