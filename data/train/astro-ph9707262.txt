    "in spite of the impressive observational and theoretical advances occured in the last decade , there are still a number of important issues concerning the structure and evolution of the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) which require more study . among these",
    ", three particularly relevant issues are discussed below .",
    "first , one would like to know to which extent the energy budget of the ism is regulated by turbulence .",
    "energy in this form is certainly supplied to the gas by the concurrent action of supernova explosions , winds from massive stars and hii regions .",
    "however , it is a difficult problem to ascertain the relative power of these sources and the total amount of energy compared to the one stored in different forms ( i.e. thermal , radiative , magnetic and cosmic ray energy ) .",
    "next , we understand that the disk of the milky way is not a close system but it is connected to the galactic halo by different forms of energy transfer involving mass entrainment ( particularly hot gas but also cold gas and dust ) and photons leaking from the production regions .",
    "it it therefore important , both for energetic and evolutionary ( chemical and dynamical ) considerations to assess the relevance of these disk / halo interactions , which , in brief , are often referred to as the galactic fountain . finally , after more than 10 years from its firm discovery , the mystery of the existence of a vertically extended , ionized gas distribution , the so - called \" reynolds layer  has not yet been dispelled .",
    "the aim of this work is to show how @xmath2 observations can help us in making progresses in each of these areas .",
    "massive stars are probably the most important energy sources for the ism .",
    "they inject power both in radiative ( with ionizing photons creating hii regions ) and mechanical ( supernova explosions ) form .",
    "the rate of _ kinetic _ energy density deposited via photoionization is @xmath3 the analogous quantity for a supernova explosion is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the total ( both type i and ii ) supernova rate and @xmath6 is the volume of the galaxy .",
    "assuming an efficiency of kinetic energy conversion into the ism @xmath7 and @xmath8 for radiative and mechanical input , respectively , we find the total rate per unit volume at which energy available for motions in the ism is produced : @xmath9  ergs   @xmath10  s@xmath11 .",
    "kinetic energy is mostly dissipated by cloud collisions at a rate @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the typical cloud density , relative velocity and the mean time interval between collisions , respectively .",
    "thus , there is clearly enough energy production to support the observed motions in the ism .",
    "these bulk motions have a strong impact on the structure of the galactic ism .",
    "for example , they are shown to largely regulate and reproduce the vertical distribution of the hi in the gravitational potential of the galaxy ( lockman & gehman 1991 ) , once the effect of radiation pressure on dust grains embedded in clouds ( the so - called `` photolevitation '' , ferrara 1993 ) is properly taken into account .",
    "in addition , turbulence may be the most important form of energy storage in the ism , as can be appreciated from fig . [ pressure ] : the thermal pressure contributed by all known gaseous ism phases , @xmath15 , appears to be at most 13% of the total pressure , @xmath16 , as derived by imposing gas hydrostatic equilibrium in the galactic gravitational field",
    ". such large ratio of the turbulent to thermal pressure , implies a large porosity factor , @xmath17 , of the hot gas .",
    "mckee ( 1990 ) estimates that @xmath18 , implying @xmath19 from the above estimates if the non - thermal energy is predominantly in turbulent form ; this corresponds to a hot gas filling factor @xmath20 .",
    "given these arguments it seems necessary to revise the current ism models to include turbulence .",
    "a first attempt in this direction has been carried out by norman & ferrara ( 1996 ) .",
    "the authors calculate the detailed grand source function ( shown in fig .",
    "[ source ] ) for the conventional sources of turbulence from supernovae , superbubbles , stellar winds and hii regions . as seen from fig .",
    "[ source ] , superbubbles are the main contributors to interstellar turbulence . in addition , from the study of the general properties of the turbulent spectrum using an approach based on a spectral transfer equation derived from the hydrodynamic kovasznay approximation , they conclude that the turbulent pressure calculated from the grand source function is @xmath21 . also , given the scale dependent energy dissipation from a turbulent cascade , the multi - phase medium concept has to be generalized to a more natural continuum description where density and temperature are functions of scale .    as recalled above",
    ", cloud collisions represent the most efficient dissipation mechanism of large scale turbulence .",
    "the simple estimate for @xmath22 given above , assumes that _ all _ the kinetic energy of the clouds is radiated away by the post - shock gas , i.e. an inelastic collision .",
    "this hypothesis is correct only in a restricted region of the collision parameters ( velocity and mass ratio of the colliding clouds , magnetic field strength , gas metallicity ) .",
    "ricotti etal .",
    "1997 have studied the dependence of the elasticity ( defined as the ratio of the final to the initial kinetic energy of the clouds ) on such parameters ( recently extended to include pre - interaction with the intercloud medium by miniati etal .",
    "they find that @xmath23 the collision elasticity is maximum for a cloud relative velocity @xmath24 km s@xmath11 ; @xmath25 the elasticity is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the metallicity and @xmath28 is the cloud size : the larger is @xmath29 , the more dissipative ( inelastic ) the collision will be . during the collision",
    "the warm post - shock gas will radiate a substantial fraction of its internal energy in the h@xmath0 line depending on @xmath30 and @xmath28 .",
    "[ halfa ] shows the h@xmath0 luminosity for a collision occurring @xmath31  kpc away from us for different values of @xmath30 and @xmath28 .",
    "thus , h@xmath0 observations can be used in principle as a powerful indicator of large scale turbulent motion dissipation .",
    "one of the major predictions and elements in favor of the galactic fountain ( gf ) model ( shapiro & field 1976 , subsequently detailed by bregman 1980 ) is the existence of the high velocity clouds ( hvcs , recently reviewed by wolfire etal .",
    "1995 ) in the halo , as a by - product of the cooling of the hot fountain gas .",
    "any constraint on the origin of hvcs would be highly valuable in terms of understanding the global disk / halo circulation .",
    "ferrara & field ( 1994 ) have investigated the ionization and thermal structure of hvcs due to the extragalactic background radiation field and calculated the h@xmath0 emission from the partially ionized edge of a given cloud . comparing the model results to the available h@xmath0 observations",
    ", the authors found that the observed h@xmath0 intensity is larger than the predicted one for all the different cases considered .",
    "one way to reconcile this dicotomy is that some of the observed emission is h@xmath0 light coming from the disk of the galaxy and subsequently back - scattered by dust in the clouds .",
    "assessing the presence of dust in hvcs is a young research field and very little is known about this issue .",
    "however , there are theoretical bases to expect dust to be present .",
    "the efficiency of dust destruction in a shock ( presumably the heating source for the fountain gas ) is likely to be less than 10% ( mckee 1989 ) ; the subsequent thermal sputtering in the hot gas might destroy some of the smallest grains : in a @xmath32  k gas , the sputtering time is shorter than the gas cooling time only for grains sizes smaller than @xmath33 m .",
    "however , previous low sensitivity searches using iras data have produced only upper limits ( wakker & boulanger 1986 ) on hvcs dust content .",
    "in addition to the unlikely complete dust depletion , there are at least two other possibilities which might explain the non - detection : ( i ) hvcs are far above the galactic plane ( @xmath34  kpc ) ; ( ii ) the dust is too cold to emit substantially in the iras bands . since , at least for some of the clouds , the distance is bracketed around a much lower value for the distance , ( i ) is an unlikely explanation .",
    "it is quite possible , instead , that the dust is cold , due to the very diluted halo radiation field . the expected ir emission from a @xmath35  @xmath36 hvc , assuming either a given temperature of the grains or a galactic isrf diluted by a given factor ( 1 - 100 times ) is shown in fig . [ dust ] together with isophot surface brightness limits ( 128 s of integration time , s / n=10 ) in the various bands .",
    "clearly , dust hotter than @xmath37  k and/or heated by a isrf diluted by at most 10 times , could be detectable .",
    "such a detection would bring strong support to the idea that hvcs are not of intergalactic origin and they are very likely part of a global disk / halo circulation .",
    "the thick ( @xmath38  kpc ) _ reynolds layer _ of diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) discovered in the galaxy and in external ones poses some of the most challenging problems for our understanding of the large scale structure of the galactic ism ( reynolds 1995 ) .",
    "one of the best ways to study this component is represented by spectroscopic observations of emission lines like @xmath2 , @xmath39(\\lambda 6583$] ) and @xmath40(\\lambda 6716$] ) .",
    "the different excitation conditions found in a given galaxy as a function of height above the plane pose a relevant question concerning the amount of light originating in the disk ( where the most obvious ionization sources are located ) and light scattered back into the line of sight by dust .",
    "this aspect has been investigated recently by ferrara etal .",
    "( 1996 ) , using monte carlo simulations to calculate the radiation transfer of @xmath2 line emission , produced both by hii regions in the disk and in the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) , through the dust layer of the galaxy ngc891 .",
    "the amount of light originating in the hii regions of the disk and scattered by egd can be then compared with the emission produced by recombinations in the dig .",
    "the cuts of photometric and polarimetric maps along the @xmath41-axis show that scattered light from hii regions is still 10% of that of the dig at @xmath42  pc ( fig .",
    "[ scatter ] ) , whereas the degree of linear polarization is small ( @xmath43% ) .",
    "this could explain the observed behavior of emission line ratios as a function of height ( ferrara etal .",
