    "a _ protein molecule machine _ ( pmm ) is an abstract probabilistic computing system @xmath0 , where    * * x * and * y * are the sets of real input and output vectors , respectively * * * s**@xmath1 is a finite set of states * @xmath2 is a function describing the input - dependent conditional probability densities of state transitions , where @xmath3 is the conditional probability of transfer from state @xmath4 to state @xmath5 during time interval @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the value of input , and @xmath8 is the set of non - negative real numbers .",
    "the components of @xmath9 are called _",
    "generalized potentials_. they can be interpreted as membrane potential , and concentrations of different neurotransmitters .",
    "* @xmath10 is a function describing output .",
    "the components of @xmath11 are called _ generalized currents_. they can be interpreted as ion currents , and the flows of second messengers .",
    "let @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 be , respectively , the values of input , output , and state at time t , and let @xmath15 be the probability that @xmath16 .",
    "the work of a pmm is described as follows : @xmath17 summing the right and the left parts of ( [ eq1 ] ) over @xmath18 yields @xmath19 so the condition ( [ eq2 ] ) holds for any t.        the internal structure of a pmm is shown in figure  1 , where @xmath20 is the probability of transition from state @xmath21 to state @xmath22 during time interval @xmath6 .",
    "the gray circle indicates the current state @xmath16 . the output @xmath23 is a function of input and the current state .",
    "for the probability of transition from state @xmath4 to state @xmath5 we have @xmath24 it follows from ( [ eq1 ] ) that @xmath25",
    "ion channels are studied by many different disciplines : biophysics , protein chemistry , molecular genetics , cell biology and others ( see extensive bibliography in @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is concerned with the information processing ( computational ) possibilities of ion channels .",
    "i postulate that , at the information processing level , ion channels ( as well as some other membrane proteins ) can be treated as pmms .",
    "that is , at this level , the exact biophysical and biochemical mechanisms are not important .",
    "what is important are the properties of ion channels as abstract machines .",
    "this situation can be meaningfully compared with the general relationship between statistical physics and thermodynamics .",
    "only some properties of molecules of a gas ( e.g. , the number of degrees of freedom ) are important at the level of thermodynamics .",
    "similarly , only some properties of protein molecules are important at the level of statistical computations implemented by the ensembles of such molecules .",
    "the general structure of a voltage - gated ion channel is shown schematically in figure [ fi2]a .",
    "figures [ fi2]b and [ fi2]c show how this channel can be represented as a pmm . in this example",
    "the pmm has five states @xmath26 , a single input @xmath27 ( the membrane potential ) and a single output @xmath28 ( the ion current ) . using the goldman - hodgkin - katz ( ghk ) current equation we have the following expression for the output function @xmath29 .",

    "it is convenient to represent this function as a matrix of voltage dependent coefficients @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "note that the diagonal elements of this matrix are not used in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .    in the model of spike generation discussed in @xcite both sodium , @xmath37 , and potassium ,",
    "@xmath36 channels were treated as pmms with five states shown in figure  [ fi2 ] .",
    "coefficients @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 where assumed to be sigmoid functions of membrane potential , and coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 - constant . in the case of the sodium channel",
    ", @xmath55 was used as a high permeability state , and @xmath56 was used as inactive state . in the case of potassium channel , @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "were assumed to be high permeability states .    *",
    "note*. as the experiments with the program channels ( mentioned in section [ sec1 ] ) show , in a model with two voltage - gated channels ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) , the spike can be generated with many different assumptions about functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "an _ ensemble of protein molecule machines _ ( epmm ) is a set of identical independent pmms with the same input vector , and the output vector equal to the sum of output vectors of individual pmms .",
    "the structure of an epmm is shown in figure [ fi3 ] , where @xmath59 is the total number of pmms , @xmath60 is the output vector of the k - th pmm , and @xmath11 is the output vector of the epmm .",

    "let us define the relative number of pmms in state @xmath63 ( the relative occupation number of state @xmath64 ) as @xmath70    the behavior of the average @xmath71 is described by the equations similar to ( [ eq1 ] ) and  ( [ eq2 ] ) . @xmath72 the average output @xmath73 is equal to the sum of average outputs for all states .",
    "@xmath74    the standard deviation for @xmath75 is equal to @xmath76 it is convenient to think of the relative occupation numbers @xmath75 as the states of analog memory of an epmm . in @xcite",
    "the states of such dynamical cellular short - term memory ( stm ) were called _ e - states_.        figure [ fi4 ] illustrates the implementation of e - states as relative occupation numbers of the microscopic states of a pmm .",
    "the number of independent e - state variables is equal to @xmath77 .",
    "the number is reduced by one because of the additional equation ( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "an epmm can serve as a robust analog computer with the input  controlled coefficient matrix shown in figure [ fi5 ] .",
    "since all the characteristics of the statistical implementation of this computer are determined by the properties of the underlying pmm , this statistical molecular implementation is very robust .",
    "the implementation using @xmath78 integrating operational amplifiers shown in figure [ fi5 ] is not very reliable .",
    "the integrators based on operational amplifiers with negative capacitive feedback are not precise , so condition ( [ eq15 ] ) will be gradually violated .",
    "( a better implementation should use any @xmath77 equations from ( [ eq14 ] ) combined with equation @xmath79 . ) in the case of the discussed statistical implementation condition @xmath79 is guaranteed because the number of pmms , @xmath59 , is constant .",
    "the most remarkable property of the statistical implementation of the analog computer shown in figure [ fi5 ] is that the matrix of input - dependent macroscopic connections is implemented as the matrix of input - dependent microscopic probabilities . for a sufficiently large number of states ( say , @xmath80 ) , it would be practically impossible to implement the corresponding analog computers ( with required biological dimensions ) relying on traditional electronic operational amplifiers with negative capacitive feedbacks that would have to be connected via difficult to make matrices of input - dependent coefficients",
    ".    a single neuron can have many different epmms interacting via electrical messages ( membrane potential ) and chemical messages ( different kinds of neurotransmitters ) . as mentioned in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "the hodgkin - huxley @xcite model can be naturally expressed in terms of two epmms ( corresponding to the sodium and potassium channels ) interacting via common membrane potential ( see figure [ fi6]a ) .",
    "figure [ fi6]b shows two epmms interacting via a second messenger . in this example , epmm1 is the primary transmitter receptor and epmm2 is the second messenger receptor .",
    "figure [ fi7 ] presents examples of computer simulation done by program channels mentioned in section  [ sec1 ] .",
    "lines 2 - 4 in figure [ fi7]a display random pulses of sodium current produced by 1 , 2 , and 3 pmms , respectively , representing sodium channel , in response to the pulse of membrane potential shown in line 1 .",
    "line 4 shows a response of 100 pmms .",
    "( a description of the corresponding patch - clamp experiments can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fi7]b depicts the spike of membrane potential produced by two interacting epmms representing ensembles of sodium and potassium channels ( @xmath81 ) .    in this simulation , the sodium and potassium channels were represented as five - state pmms mentioned in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the specific values of parameters are not important for the purpose of this illustration .",
    "[ fi8 ] let the number of pmms go to infinity ( @xmath82 ) . in this case",
    "epmm is a deterministic system described by the set of differential equations [ eq14 ] and [ eq15 ] . in some cases of highly nonlinear input - dependent coefficients @xmath83 , it is convenient to think about this dynamical system as a _ distributed state machine _ ( dsm ) .",
    "such machine simultaneously occupies all its discrete states , with the levels of occupation described by the _ occupation vector _ @xmath84 .",
    "we replaced @xmath71 by @xmath85 , since @xmath82 .",
    "this interpretation offers a convenient language for representing dynamical processes whose outcome depends on the sequence of input events . in the same way as a traditional state machine is used as a logic sequencer , a dsm can be used as an analog sequencer . the example shown in figure [ fi8 ] illustrates this interesting possibility .    if the sequence of input events is @xmath86 the dsm ends up `` almost completely '' in state 2 ( lines 1 - 3 ) .",
    "the ba sequence leads to state 4 ( lines 4 - 6 ) .",
    "many different implementations of a dsm producing this sequencing effect can be found .",
    "here is an example of an epmm implementation :    let @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and let @xmath83 be described as follows : if input satisfies condition @xmath89 ( event a ) then @xmath90 for transitions @xmath91 ; if input satisfies condition @xmath92 ( event b ) then @xmath90 for transitions @xmath93 . in all other cases @xmath94 .    this example can be interpreted as follows .",
    "if input @xmath95 exceeds its threshold level @xmath96 before input @xmath97 exceeds its threshold level @xmath98 , the epmm ends up `` mostly '' in state 2 .",
    "if these events occur in the reverse direction , the epmm ends up `` mostly '' in state 4 .",
    "starting with the classical work of mcculloch and pitts @xcite it is well known that any computable function can be implemented as a network of rather simple artificial neurons . though the original concept of the mccullough - pitts logic neuron is now replaced by a more sophisticated model of a leaky integrate - and - fire ( lif ) neuron @xcite ,",
    "the latter model is still very simple as compared to the epmm formalism discussed in the present paper .",
    "_ why does the brain need statistical molecular computations ? _ _ why is it not sufficient to do collective statistical computations at the level of neural networks ? _",
    "the answer to this question is straightforward .",
