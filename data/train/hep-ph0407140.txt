    "in recent years a series of exciting experimental results have shown that neutrinos have finite masses and mixings .",
    "for a recent review of the status see ref .",
    "solar neutrino and atmospheric neutrino results indicate that all three known neutrino flavors ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) participate in neutrino mixing , and hence neutrino oscillations .",
    "consequently , the standard framework to describe the experimental results and analyse neutrino oscillation data is that of three - flavor mixing in which the three flavor eigenstates are related to three mass eigenstates by a @xmath2 mixing matrix@xcite . the positive signal for @xmath3 oscillations from the lsnd experiment@xcite challenges the three - flavor mixing paradigm@xcite .",
    "however , the neutrino oscillation interpretation of the lsnd observations is yet to be confirmed .",
    "independent of whether or not the lsnd results are confirmed by miniboone@xcite , the three - flavor mixing framework deserves further experimental scrutiny in the coming years .",
    "much of the focus on future experiments so far has been directed to the determination of the 3-mixing angles and the cp - violating phase with long - baseline or oscillation experiments@xcite and reactor experiments@xcite . of interest in this paper",
    "is the measurement of the neutral current , which could allow tests of the unitarity of the @xmath4 mixing matrix and thus indirectly probe the existence of sterile neutrinos .    in a three - flavor neutrino model ,",
    "the sum of the oscillation probabilities@xmath5 is unity .",
    "if there are more than three light neutrinos , we know from measurements of the invisible width of the @xmath6  @xcite that the additional neutrinos must be sterile .",
    "if additional light neutrinos mix with the three known flavors we can expect a non - zero oscillation probability to sterile neutrinos , @xmath7 . to test the three - flavor neutrino - mixing paradigm it is important to search for a sterile neutrino component within the neutrino flux from natural and manmade sources . since sterile neutrinos have no strong or electroweak interactions , they can not be detected directly .",
    "however , neutral current ( nc ) measurements allow @xmath5 to be determined which , by probability conservation , is equal to @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , in principle a nc measurement alone is sufficient to determine @xmath9 .",
    "however , in a realistic detector misidentifications of cc and nc events , together with systematic uncertainties on the relevent neutrino interaction cross sections , complicate the analysis .",
    "in this paper we study the use of nc measurements to determine limits on the sterile neutrino content in long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "first we consider the sensitivity to the sterile content that might be obtained in a k2k - like@xcite , t2k - like@xcite , and minos - like@xcite experiment with a `` perfect '' detector and `` perfect '' beam if there are no systematic uncertainties .",
    "we then consider the impact on the sensitivity of event misidentification and systematic uncertainties .",
    "our study is based on a simple simulation of the long - baseline neutrino beams , neutrino interactions  @xcite , and detector responses .",
    "we present our results versus event rates and the size of the cross section uncertainty in order to show the dependence on these quantities .",
    "the present and proposed long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments exploit conventional neutrino beams that are produced by the decays of charged pions in a long channel .",
    "this produces a beam which is initially almost entirely @xmath10 .",
    "kaons and muons decaying in the channel introduce a small ( typically @xmath11% ) @xmath12 component in the neutrino beam . as the neutrino beam travels towards a distant detector its flavor content will evolve . in our analysis",
    "we will consider three active neutrinos ( @xmath12 , @xmath10 , @xmath13 ) and one sterile neutrino ( @xmath14 ) , with oscillation probabilities @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "we begin by considering an oscillation experiment that has an initially pure @xmath10 beam with well known neutrino spectrum and flux , and a detector with perfect identification of the produced events .",
    "then the event rates at the far detector will be @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the predicted number of @xmath10 cc interactions in the detector in the absence of oscillations and the @xmath19 denote the interaction cross sections @xmath20 for ( @xmath12 , @xmath10 , @xmath13 ) cc interactions and @xmath21 for @xmath22 nc interactions .    in an ideal experiment",
    "@xmath23 determines @xmath24 and @xmath25 determines @xmath26 . in practice",
    "the presence of @xmath12 and @xmath13 cc events complicates the analysis if these events are not distinguished from nc events . in that circumstance",
    "the nc events provide a measure of @xmath27 , where the factors @xmath28 and @xmath29 reflect the contaminations .",
    "probability conservation ( @xmath30 ) can be used to eliminate @xmath31 or @xmath32 , but not both .",
    "if the beam energy is below the threshold for @xmath33 production or the probability @xmath32 is small and can be neglected , then @xmath24 can still be determined . however , for a realistic detector with particle misidentifications and/or a @xmath12 component at the far detector that can not be neglected , the problem of determining @xmath34 can be complex but still solvable , as we shall discuss .    in general ,",

    "we let @xmath45 ( it is known to be small , at the 5% level or less from the chooz experiment@xcite ) .",
    "it is convenient to define the following two ratios , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is a normalized misidentification factor that gives the fraction of events identified as being of type @xmath36 that are really events of type @xmath35 .",
    "measuring @xmath49 and @xmath50 is sufficient for deducing @xmath24 ( and @xmath26 ) .",
    "the analysis depends on whether or not we are above the @xmath13 cc interaction threshold , i.e. , whether or not there are @xmath13 cc events produced in the detector .      for neutrino energies below the @xmath33 threshold @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in this case",

    "note that the normalized mis - identification factors @xmath58 and @xmath59 will be sensitive to the neutrino energy spectrum and the detector technology , and therefore must be evaluated for each experimental setup .",
    "most of the mis - identification terms are suppressed by @xmath60 ; if @xmath61 then @xmath62 . if the experimental setup is such that we can ignore all terms of order @xmath60 , ( see table  1 ) we have @xmath63 which measures the significance of the deviation of @xmath24 from zero .    for a perfect detector that can identify each event correctly , @xmath64 . in this limit @xmath65 and @xmath66",

    "an event simulation is used to determine the relevent detection efficiencies and misidentification factors .",
    "we use the neugen monte carlo code  @xcite to simulate neutrino interactions in the detector .",
    "events are classified as @xmath10 cc , @xmath12 cc , or nc . in practice",
    "the requirements used to identify events of a given type will depend upon the detector technology .",
    "for example , for a water cherenkov detector in our simple analysis we will define a @xmath12 cc event candidate as an event with an electron candidate above threshold .",
    "an electron candidate is either a real electron or a @xmath102 with an energy exceeding 1  gev ( in which case the two daughter photons from the high energy @xmath102 produce cherenkov rings that overlap in the detector and can not be distinguished from a single electromagnetically showering particle ) .",
    "a nc event candidate would be an event containing a @xmath102 candidate but no muon candidate , where a @xmath102 candidate has two @xmath0-like rings above threshold ( which come from a @xmath102 with energy less than 1  gev ) .",
    "the definition of cc and nc events can of course be varied , and then tuned to give favorable values for the signal efficiencies and mis - identification factors .",
    "examples are shown in table  1 .      to identify the most important systematic uncertainties it is useful to compare the sensitivity of our  perfect experiment \" with that of a realistic experiment .",
    "we begin with the k2k experiment .",
    "k2k uses a beam from the kek laboratory in japan .",
    "the neutrinos in the kek beam have a mean energy of 1.3  gev  @xcite , and the neutrinos travel 250  km to the super - k water cerenkov detector .",
    "a new experiment t2k is being planned that will exploit a more intense neutrino source that is presently under construction at tokai , japan .",
    "t2k will also use the super - k detector , but with a slightly longer baseline ( 300  km ) and narrow - band beam with an axis displaced slightly from pointing directly at the far detector ( an `` off - axis '' beam ) .",
    "the real experimental sensitivities of the k2k and t2k experiments can only be determined by the experimental collaborations . in the following we use the neugen monte carlo program to simulate neutrino interactions together with a simple model for the response of a super - k - like detector .",
    "although this is inadequate to precisely predict the real k2k and t2k sensitivities , it does enable us to identify the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties , and hence explore how the experimental results will depend upon the sizes of these systematics .",
    "we use the following parameterization of a super - k - like detector response :    * a threshold of 197  mev / c for the detection and measurement of muons  @xcite , and 100  mev / c for electrons and @xmath102 s .",
    "these thresholds approximate those used for the atmospheric neutrino analysis of super - k  @xcite .",
    "* energy resolutions given by  @xcite @xmath103 for electrons and @xmath102 s and @xmath104 for charged pions and muons .    in addition , we use a parametrization of the spectra for the k2k and t2k neutrino beams . in our analysis",
    "we will use only simulated events with visible energy greater than 0.1  gev . for our `` basic '' signals",
    "we define a @xmath10 cc event candidate as an event with a single muon - like ring , a @xmath12 cc event candidate as an event with a single @xmath0-like ring , and a nc event candidate as an event with two @xmath0-like rings , which are assumed to be two photons from a single @xmath102 decay .",
    "given these definitions , the detector efficiencies and mis - identification factors determined from our simulations are listed in table  [ tab : signals ] . as shown in the table , the efficiencies @xmath105 are of order one - half , and there is no significant contamination of one signal by another due to mis - identification . also shown are the results of a more aggressive signal definition , where a simulated event with an odd number of @xmath0-like rings is labeled as a @xmath12 cc event candidate , and the remaining events ( those with an even number of @xmath0-like rings ) are labeled as @xmath10 cc event candidates if they have one or more @xmath106-like rings or nc if they do not . in this more aggressive scenario",
    "no events are discarded , i.e. , all events were used for one of the targeted signals .",
    "although some of the misidentification factors are slightly larger for the aggressive scenario , overall they are not greatly changed , while there is a significant improvement in the efficiencies for the cc events .    to investigate whether our analysis is sensitive to the assumed details of the neutrino spectrum we have repeated the calculation of efficiencies and misidentification factors for a k2k - like experiment with a beam that has the same average energy and beam spread as the k2k beam , but with a gaussian energy spectrum ( no long high - energy tail ) .",
    "for the gaussian beam , the misidentification factors involving @xmath12 were greatly reduced ( since backgrounds from the high - energy tail are now suppressed ) , but @xmath58 and @xmath59 were only slightly affected . since @xmath58 is the dominant @xmath107 factor for a k2k - like experiment , we conclude that our results are not very sensitive to the detailed beam spectrum we assume .",
    "we now consider a t2k - like experiment , where we have used a beam spectrum that corresponds to a detector 2 degrees off - axis .",
    "the resulting mis - identification factors for a t2k - like experiment are shown in table  [ tab : signals ] .",
    "all of the misidentification factors are reduced except for @xmath58 , which is now 0.25 .",
    "therefore , in both the k2k - like and t2k - like experiments , the most important contamination is @xmath10 cc events being mis - identified as nc events .      the minos experiment is a long - baseline oscillation exeriment that will use a neutrino beam from the fermilab main injector and an iron - scintillator sampling calorimeter 730  km away in minnesota .",
    "minos is expected to begin data taking early in 2005 . with a beam energy that is about a factor of three higher than the kek beam , and a detector that is very different from the water cerenkov detector used by k2k and t2k",
    ", the efficiencies and misidentification factors for minos will be very different than those for the experiments in japan . to compute the numbers given in table  [ tab : signals ]",
    "we have once again used a parametrization of the neutrino beam spectrum , the neugen monte carlo program to simulate neutrino interactions in an iron detector , and a simple parametrization of the response of a minos - like detector .",
    "in particular we assume :    * an energy threshold of 50 mev for the detection and measurement of electrons , and charged and neutral pions , and a threshold of 1  gev for the identification and measurement of muons .",
    "note that the minos detector is expected to be able to determine the charge and measure the momenta of muons from 0.5  gev / c to 100  gev / c , and to distinguish @xmath10 cc events from nc events if the muons have momenta exceeding about 1  gev / c  @xcite . * energy resolutions given by @xmath108 for electrons and @xmath102 s , @xmath109 for charged pions , and @xmath110 for muons .",
    "note that in practice the muon energy resolution for the minos experiment is expected to be somewhat better ( worse ) than described by eq .",
    "[ eq : deltae5 ] if the muon ranges out ( does not range out ) in the detector .",
    "we found that @xmath111 values as high as 0.10 do not appreciably change our results .",
    "as shown in the table , for a minos - like experiment there is a very large contamination of the nc channel by @xmath10 cc events , and mis - identification of @xmath13 cc events as nc events is also significant .",
    "the efficiency for identifying nc events is about one - half , similar to the k2k - like and t2k - like experiments signal , in addition to @xmath10 and nc signals , to be able to solve for all of the probabilities .",

    "we first find the sensitivity of the nc unitarity test for a perfect detector , i.e. , a detector that can categorize each event correctly as cc muon or nc , with no mis - identification and 100% efficiency .",
