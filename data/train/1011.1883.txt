    "the intriguing relation between evolutionary dynamics and statistical mechanics @xcite has attracted the interest of classical evolutionary theorists .",
    "fisher @xcite and kimura @xcite have related their results to the second principle of thermodynamics and to the theory of gases .",
    "interestingly , the relation between evolutionary theory @xcite and quantum statistical mechanics is emerging from a series of independent works @xcite that show a class of phase transitions occurring in the evolution of haploid populations and other evolving complex systems described by a bose - einstein condensation . in haploid populations ,",
    "this transition is the quasi - species phase transition @xcite in which a finite fraction of an asexual population ends up having the same genotype if the selective pressure is higher than a critical value and the mutation rate is smaller than a critical value .",
    "moreover , in a recent paper @xcite it has been shown that a condensation transition in the bose - einstein universality class occurs also in the evolution of diploid sexual populations in presence of epistatic interactions .",
    "when this condensation occurs , a finite fraction of pairs of genetic loci in epistatic interactions is fixed .",
    "the deep relation between evolutionary theory and quantum mechanics formalisms extends also to the dynamical description of biological evolution .",
    "the quantum spin - chain formalism @xcite and the schdinger equation in imaginary time @xcite have been shown to solve models of asexual evolution .",
    "the role of path integrals in describing the temporal evolution of populations @xcite has been highlighted recently .",
    "biological evolution is essentially a stochastic process .",
    "the relation between quantum mechanics and stochastic dynamics has been deeply explored over the years @xcite . in particular",
    "the existing theory of stochastic processes for diffusing particles is described by langevin and fokker - planck equations .",
    "stochastic quantization approaches define stochastic diffusing processes whose probability density converges to path integrals of some specific quantum system @xcite .",
    "stochastic quantization has attracted large interest in the physics community and has been shown to allow for large numerical simulations of quantum systems @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose a unified framework for quasi - species biological evolution and stochastic quantization .",
    "in the first part of the paper we describe the evolution of an asexual population with overlapping generations in the limit of large populations .",
    "we show that it is possible to describe the evolution of a population in terms of eigenfunctions of the evolutionary dynamics , and this description allows for a generalization of the fisher theorem in presence of mutations .",
    "we show that the variation in time of the average fitness of the population is proportional to the variance of the eigenvalues of the evolutionary dynamics .",
    "therefore the average fitness of the population asymptotically in time reaches the highest eigenvalue of the evolutionary dynamics .",
    "this relation is very general and applies as well in absence of mutations , for low mutation rate and for high mutation rate .",
    "therefore it is not in general related to the localization of the eigenfunction with maximal fitness on the fitness landscape .",
    "moreover , in the first part of the paper related to biological evolution we review the results of the kingman model which are related to the emergence of quantum statistics in the equation of biological evolution .",
    "these results are related to the quasi - species description of evolutionary dynamics that neglects genetic drift , which has significant relevance in presence of small populations and small mutation rate @xmath1 or in the cases in which the population is fluctuating and undergoes population bottlenecks .    in the second part of the paper we consider an ensemble of elementary particles which do not only diffuse , like in existing approaches of stochastic quantization , but undergo also creation and annihilation processes mimicking the dynamics of biological evolution .",
    "the probability density @xmath2 that a generic particle is at position @xmath3 at time @xmath4 follows the quasi - species equation @xcite first proposed by eigen @xcite to describe biological evolution .",
    "this allows us to define a new dictionary for a mapping from the evolutionary theory to the stochastic dynamics of particles undergoing the creation - annihilation process .",
    "the ensemble of particles is subjected to a stochastic gaussian noise and a potential energy .",
    "the stochastic noise can be mapped to the mutations of biological evolution and the potential energy can be mapped to a fisher fitness function .",
    "moreover the stochastic evolution strongly depends on the parameter @xmath0 , that we call the _ inverse temperature _ of the system , playing the equivalent role of _ selection pressure _ in the biological evolutionary mapping .",
    "the probability of a certain configuration of the ensemble of particles satisfies the quasi - species equation and can be decomposed into eigenfunctions of the evolutionary operator with a discrete spectrum . for low values of @xmath0 , @xmath5 ( i.e.",
    "selection pressure _ ) the quasi - species equation is directly related to the schrdinger equation , while for @xmath6 ( i.e. , high _ selection pressure _ )",
    "the quasi - species equation strongly deviates from the schrdinger equation . in order to solve in one case the quasi - species equation for all possible values of the inverse temperature",
    "we explicitly solve the case of an harmonic potential .",
    "the evolution turns out to be dissipative , with a relaxation of the configuration to the fundamental state .",
    "moreover we investigate the role of genetic drift in this model , showing that thanks to the gaussian nature of the noise the systems always reaches a stationary state .",
    "in particular , asymptotically in time the spatial distribution of particles fluctuates around the fundamental state predicted by the solution of the quasi - species equation .",
    "the smaller is the number of particles the stronger are the fluctuations aournd the mean .",
    "moreover we include an additional noise describing a scattering process of the particles such that after each scattering process a particle takes a random position distributed according to a fixed probability distribution .",
    "when we introduce this scattering probability the ensemble of particles is proven to follow a bose - einstein distribution .",
    "interestingly , the relaxation occurring in absence of the scattering process obeys a dynamical equation which has its equivalent in the generalization of the fisher theorem found in the mean - field treatment of the biological evolution presented in the first part of this paper . in this mapping",
    "the ground state of the ensemble of particles corresponds to the state of maximal reproductive rate of the asexual population .",
    "therefore the relaxation of the ensemble of particles to the ground state corresponds to the relaxation to the state corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue of the evolution of an asexual population .",
    "finally , in presence of the scattering process the bose - einstein distribution is emerging naturally with similarities to the kingman model @xcite for the evolution of asexual populations with infinite number of genetic loci .",
    "the genome of an asexual organism is formed by a single copy of each chromosome . if we indicate by @xmath7 a genetic locus , a given genotype is determined by the allelic states @xmath8 at each genetic locus @xmath9 .",
    "the allelic state @xmath10 at each genetic locus @xmath9 can take 4 values corresponding to adenine , thymine , cytosine , guanine , i.e. @xmath11 .",
    "the population evolves under the drive of selection that favors allelic configurations corresponding to higher reproduction rate , and mutations that increase the genetic variation in the population .",
    "we assume that the reproductive rate @xmath12 also called wright fitness of a genotype @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fisher fitness and @xmath0 is the _ selective pressure_. if @xmath16 every genotype has the same reproductive rate . if @xmath6 the difference in the reproductive rate of genotypes having different @xmath15 is strongly enhanced .",

    "if we define the probability @xmath18 that at time @xmath4 an individual has genome @xmath13 , the dynamical equation of evolution of @xmath18 is given by the mean - field equation , valid for large populations or growing populations , i.e. = m_\\{}|\\{^}-p(\\{},t ) [ ev ] where the operator @xmath19 is defined in @xmath20 and @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 \\label{q1}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the mutation rate .",

    "therefore the partition function @xmath24 is given by @xmath42 where the average @xmath43 is performed over the functions @xmath35 given by @xmath37 .",
    "finally , using @xmath37 we can derive the equation obeyed by the partition function @xmath44 , @xmath45 this equation generalizes the fisher theorem of natural selection @xcite in presence of mutations and describes the fact that evolution is an off - equilibrium process .",
    "in fact , @xmath46 is the average reproductive rate of the population .",
    "@xmath47 expresses the fact that this average reproductive rate , asymptotically in time , evolves toward the fundamental state @xmath48 , as long as the environment does not change , i.e. the fisher fitness function @xmath15 and the selective pressure remain constant in time .",
    "the rate at which the average fitness change is equal to the variance of the eigenvalues @xmath30 over the distribution @xmath35 . in the fisher theorem ,",
    "valid in absence of mutations , the average fitness increases proportionally to the variance of the individual fitnesses .",
    "therefore we see that the generalization of the fisher theorem @xcite , equivalent to the price equation @xcite , can be done substituting the variance of the individual fitnesses with the variance of the eigenvalues of the evolutionary dynamics .",
    "we note here that since @xmath35 sum up to one , but they are not necessarily positive definite , in presence of mutations , the fitness of the population can either increase or decrease . in any case , asymptotically in time the population is described by the eigenfunction associated to the maximal eigenvalue @xmath48 .",
    "we observe here that the price equation corresponds to the decomposition of the eq .",
    "@xmath47 in a term independent of the mutation rate and a term dependent on the mutation rate .",
    "moreover we observe that the fisher theorem is not only valid in presence of constant fitness landscape , considered in this paper , but is also valid in presence of fluctuating environments .",

    "we refer the reader to the recent papers @xcite .",

    "we have shown that the dynamics of biological evolution of non - overlapping generations and large populations is naturally expressed in terms of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the evolutionary dynamics .",
    "this approach allows for a generalization of the fisher theorem in presence of mutations . in this framework",
    "the average fitness of the population changes in time proportionally to the variance of the eigenvalues instead of the variance of the fitness of the individuals .",
    "moreover we have shown that the quasi - species equation describing the evolution of a large ensemble of particles provides an alternative path to stochastic quantization with respect to existing approaches .",
    "the probability distribution of the ensemble of particles can be decomposed into the eigenfunctions of the evolution operator . in the low temperature limit",
    "the quasi - species equation is related to the schrdinger equation .",
    "therefore , in this limit the spectrum coincides with the spectrum of the associated quantum dynamics .",
    "interestingly , in the presence of a noise mimicking random scattering processes the bose - einstein distribution can be reached .",
    "direct relations between biological evolution and quantum mechanics were proposed in the book _",
    "what is life ? _",
    "@xcite by erwin schrdinger . since",
    "then this idea continues to fascinate biologists and physicists and it is gaining momentum in these last years @xcite . the relations between quasi - species evolution and quantum mechanics pointed out here are of formal nature .",
    "we believe that this paper open new perspectives on the relation between quasi - species evolution , stochastic processes and stochastic quantization that will stimulate further research at the intersection of these fields .",
