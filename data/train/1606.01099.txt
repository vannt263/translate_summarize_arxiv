    "disorder is an unavoidable feature of condensed matter and atomic many - body systems , in both classical as well as quantum domains @xcite .",
    "there are long - standing quests to understand several non - trivial quantum phenomena caused due to the presence of disorder .",
    "some of the prominent examples in the quantum case are disorder induced localizations @xcite , high @xmath1 superconductivity @xcite , and novel quantum phases @xcite .    for disordered parameters in a physical system",
    ", two typical situations may arise depending on the interrelation between the two fundamental time scales associated with the disordered parameter , viz .",
    "the time scale over which the disorder configuration equilibriates and the time scale associated with observation of the physical quantities of interest @xcite . for the cases where the system s disorder configuration remains effectively frozen throughout the entire observation process , the disorder is considered to be  quenched \" .",
    "in such cases , one obtains the quenched averaged free energy as the logarithm of the partition function , averaged over several realizations of the random parameters .",
    "however , there can be a separate situation where the observation takes place during the equilibriation process of the disorder parameters , so that the time scale associated with the configurational change is of the order or within a few orders of the observation time .",
    "in such cases , the randomness of the corresponding system parameters should be considered to be  annealed \" and the partition function has to be averaged over several random realizations , so that the annealed averaged free energy is obtained by taking the logarithm of the averaged partition function",
    ".    there has been continuous efforts to understand effects of disorder in quantum systems @xcite .",
    "a particular reason of recent interest in such systems is also due to the fact that current technology allows us to realize artificial randomness in a controlled way , in for example ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "a considerable amount of effort has been dedicated to investigate disordered systems that are quenched @xcite , and in particular to understand the effects of such disorder on the universal dynamics in the vicinity of quantum phase transitions @xcite , a useful test for which is given by the harris criterion @xcite .",
    "unlike quenched disorder , the universality class of a phase transition is usually not affected by the presence of annealed disorder , as the partition function after averaging over random realizations can be replaced by one corresponding to an effective model which is free from the disorder . in other instances ,",
    "quenched disorder spin systems have been studied to understand ",
    "glassy \" properties in type ii superconductors @xcite , to demonstrate break - down of thermalization in the presence of disorder @xcite , to achieve quantum advantages due to the introduction of the disorder @xcite and to explore disorder induced quantum phenomena such as  order from disorder \" @xcite .",
    "significant works have also been carried out for studying the consequences of annealed disorder in the spin systems as well @xcite .",
    "moreover , efforts have been directed towards understanding system properties at equilibrium when the nature of the disorder changes from quenched to annealed @xcite .    in this respect , an important question , which to our knowledge is yet to be dealt with ,",
    "is how the thermodynamical quantities respond in joint presence of quenched and annealed disorders .",
    "it is for example possible to inquire about the properties of a quantum spin system governed by the hamiltonian @xmath2 , where the disorder introduced in one set of parameters , say the couplings in @xmath3 , remain quenched during the observation process , while the equilibriating time scales of another set , say the field parameters in @xmath4 , is of same or near order as the observation time scale , so that the latter colection forms an annealed set of parameters .",
    "the main focus of this paper is to study the equilibrium properties , such as magnetization and critical temperatures , of such systems , and compare between them and with systems having only quenched or only annealed disorder or systems devoid of disorder .",
    "spontaneous magnetization in higher - dimensional quantum @xmath0 model in presence of an unidirectional quenched random field has been considered with a lot of interest in recent times .",
    "it has been shown that spontaneous magnetization perishes when a small random magnetic field with appropriate symmetry is introduced in the @xmath0 spin systems @xcite . however , it persists in absence of the appropriate symmetry of the external random field @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that a uniaxial random field may help the system to magnetize even in two - dimension @xcite . recently",
    ", mean - field approach@xcite has been adapted to look into the aspects of spontaneous magnetizations and critical scalings in quenched disordered spin models @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate spontaneous magnetization subjected to random interaction or / and random external field in disordered quantum spin-@xmath5 @xmath0 models , with a mean - field approximation .",
    "the interaction is annealed disordered or quenched disordered or ordered .",
    "the transverse magnetic field is again chosen from these three options .",
    "we compare between systems having all the nine possible combinations of interaction and field with respect to their disorder .",
    "presence of randomness in the interaction strength preserves isotropic symmetry of the system , while a small random field , even with zero mean , breaks the same and the system magnetizes in either parallel or perpendicular direction to the applied random field .",
    "we derive analytical expressions for the critical temperatures and near - critical magnetizations for all the cases .",
    "our analysis reveals , for example , that annealed disorder present in the interaction term does not have any effect on the system s spontaneous magnetization and the corresponding critical temperature , irrespective of the presence or absence of quenched or annealed disorder in the field .",
    "however , annealed disorder considered in the field term affects the transverse magnetization while keeping the magnetization parallel to the applied field unaltered . quenched",
    "randomness always causes the magnetizations to shrink in value , whether or not there is an accompanying annealed disorder in another parameter of the system .",
    "however , we find that there can be situations where the critical temperature is not affected by the presence of quenched disorder .    the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the mechanism for computing the annealed and quenched averaged values of the observables .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the distinction between quenched and annealed disorder is determined by relative comparison of two different time scales of the physical system under consideration , viz .",
    "the relaxation time associated with the equilibriation of the disorders , say @xmath6 , and the time necessary for the required observation on the system , say @xmath7 . for the cases where @xmath6 is of same or near order of magnitude of @xmath7 , the statistical properties of the system at equilibrium",
    "is obtained via annealed averaging , which is calculated by averaging of the partition function , @xmath8 , over several random realizations .",
    "the free energy for systems with the annealed disorder is given as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath12 being the absolute temperature . here , and",
    "in the rest of the paper the notation @xmath13 shall imply an average of the argument over the relevant disorder degrees of freedom .",
    "however , if @xmath14 , i.e. , the impurities remain trapped in random but fixed positions during the observation time , the statistical properties of the system at equilibrium is obtained via quenched averaging . in case of quenched averaging , the logarithm of the partition function , instead of the partition function itself , is averaged over several random realizations .",
    "the free energy in presence of the quenched disorder is given by @xmath15 .",
    "let us note here that for both types of disorders as well as for the ordered systems , the observation time is assumed to be much longer than the relaxation of the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "let us consider a general hamiltonian @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are two sets of system parameters that are respectively annealed and quenched disordered .",
    "we introduce the functional partition function @xmath19 $ ] , where the term @xmath20 is an auxiliary function .",
    "the auxiliary function is used later for obtaining the expectation values of the operator @xmath21 by taking derivatives with respect to @xmath22 at @xmath23 @xmath24 , where @xmath8 has been implicitly assumed to be a differentiable function of the @xmath25 s .",
    "the functional free energy , @xmath26 , after performing configurational averaging over the two types of disorder , reads as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 represents the probability density functions of the annealed and quenched parameters , respectively .",
    "the thermodynamic average of the observable @xmath30 , averaged also over the disorder degrees of freedom , can finally be obtained as @xmath31 .",
    "we investigate the isotropic quantum @xmath0 spin model in an external magnetic field with disorder in the interaction part or in the field part or in both , within a mean - field approximation .",

    "the constant @xmath47 is a dimensionless quantity that depends on the hamiltonian and the lattice on which it is defined .",
    "we shall discuss further about it in the next paragraph .",
    "in the mean - field approach , we approximate the interaction term by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the spins as well as disorder averaged magentizations of the system at absolute temperature @xmath12 . @xmath49 and @xmath50 are therefore mean - field variables to be obtained from the self - consistency equations of the mean - field theory .",
    "the interaction term can be further rewritten as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance .",

    "we find that spontaneous magnetization persists in the presence of randomness in these models . the ordered system and the disordered systems with randomness only in couplings exhibit magnetization for all possible orientations due to the continuous circular symmetry . the circular symmetry breaks down in presence of an infinitesimal unidirectional disordered field . in presence of the random field , which can be annealed or quenched , the system exhibits magnetization for two selective orientations",

    "<S> we investigate equilibrium statistical properties of the quantum @xmath0 spin-1/2 model in an external magnetic field when the interaction and field parts are subjected to quenched or / and annealed disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the randomness present in the system are termed annealed or quenched depending on the relation between two different time scales - the time scale associated with the equilibriation of the randomness and the time of observation . within a mean - field framework , we study the effects of disorders on spontaneous magnetization , both by perturbative and numerical techniques . </S>",
    "<S> our primary interest is to understand the differences between quenched and annealed cases , and also to investigate the interplay when both of them are present in a system . </S>",
    "<S> we observe in particular that when interaction and field terms are respectively quenched and annealed , critical temperature for the system to magnetize in the direction parallel to the applied field does not depend on any of the disorders . </S>",
    "<S> further , an annealed disordered interaction neither affects the magnetizations nor the critical temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out a comparative study of the different combinations of the disorders in the interaction and field terms , and point out their generic features . </S>"
