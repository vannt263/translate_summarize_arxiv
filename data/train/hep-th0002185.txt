    "in the context of 1 + 1-dimensional integrable quantum field theories numerous methods have been developed to compute various quantities in an exact manner , that is non - perturbative in the coupling constant .",
    "sometimes it is even possible to perform the related computations analytically .",
    "often the evaluation within one particular approach lacks information , typically a constant , which might be supplied by an entirely different method .",
    "ideally one would like to achieve a situation in which each approach is self - consistent .",
    "an example for the situation just outlined is given for instance in the form - factor program @xcite , which allows in principle to compute correlation functions .",
    "the lowest non - vanishing form - factor is not fixed within this approach and is typically obtained from elsewhere .",
    "for instance the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor can be extracted from the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can compute correlation functions by perturbing around the conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "also in this approach one appeals to the thermodynamic bethe ansatz for the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor and to the bethe ansatz @xcite for the relation between the coupling constant and the masses .",
    "the latter correspondence is also needed in an approach initiated recently in @xcite , where it was observed that the ultraviolet asymptotic behaviour for many theories may be well approximated by zero - mode dynamics .",
    "the considerations in @xcite exploit the knowledge of an exact reflection amplitude , which on one hand results from certain manipulation on the three - point function of the underlying ultraviolet conformal field theory and on the other hand has a semi - classical counterpart in the related quantum mechanical problem .",
    "the question why this approach allows to compute scaling functions with a high accuracy is still to be settled @xcite .",
    "the computation of scaling functions by means of the tba does conceptually not require any additional input from other methods .",
    "however , up - to - now it is only possible to tackle the problem numerically due to the nonlinear nature of the central equation involved .",
    "several attempts have been made to formulate analytical approximations .",
    "this is desirable for various reasons , one being that the numerical effort becomes quite considerable for some models with increasing particle species content .",
    "a further reason is of course that analytical expressions allow to study further the deeper structures of the theories .",
    "for instance for affine toda field theories ( atft ) @xcite related to simply laced lie algebras some analytical expressions have been provided @xcite . in the approximation method of @xcite",
    "a constant was left undetermined , which can be fixed in the same spirit as outlined for the other methods in the preceding paragraph , namely by appealing to another approach .",
    "contrary to the claim in @xcite , we demonstrate in the present manuscript that it is possible to fix the constant in this way without approximating higher order terms . extending the analysis of @xcite also to the non - simply laced case in the present manuscript",
    ", we will demonstrate in addition that the constant may also be well approximated from within the tba - analysis .",
    "furthermore , we give simple analytical expressions for improved approximations in the large and small density regime .    our manuscript is organized as follows : in section 2 we provide large and small density approximations for the solutions of the tba - equations . in section 3",
    "we assemble the necessary data for atft needed to extend our previous analysis to the non - simply laced case .",
    "we derive universal tba - equations and y - systems for _ all _ atft and show how they may be utilized to improve on the analytical approximations .",
    "we derive the related scaling function .",
    "we test the quality of the various approximations for the explicit example of the sinh - gordon model and the @xmath1-atft .",
    "we state our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "the object of investigation of the tba is a multiparticle system containing @xmath2 different particle species with masses @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) whose dynamical interaction is described by a factorizable diagonal scattering matrix @xmath5 , which is a function of the rapidity difference @xmath6 .",
    "we assume the statistical interaction to be of fermionic type . adopting the notation of @xcite the thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations @xcite , which characterize the thermodynamic equilibrium of such a system ,",
    "are the @xmath2 coupled nonlinear integral equations @xmath7 here the scaling parameter @xmath8 is given by the inverse temperature times a mass scale .",
    "the convolution of two functions is abbreviated as usual by @xmath9 .",
    "the tba kernel reads @xmath10 the functions @xmath11 , which are to be determined as solutions of the tba equations ( [ tbae ] ) , are related to the particle densities @xmath12 and the densities of available states @xmath13 as @xmath14 , such that for physical reasons @xmath15 . keeping this definition in mind , we speak of the large density regime when @xmath16 and of the small density regime when @xmath17 .",
    "it is sometimes useful to express matters in terms the pseudo - energies @xmath18.$ ]    having solved the tba - equations ( [ tbae ] ) for the @xmath19functions one is in principle in the position to evaluate the scaling function    @xmath20    which can be interpreted as off - critical effective central charge belonging to the conformal field theory obtained in the ultraviolet limit , i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "it is our goal in this manuscript to approximate this function in a simple analytical way to high accuracy .",
    "in general it is possible to solve the tba - equations numerically , where the convergence of the iterative procedure is guaranteed by means of the banach fixed point theorem @xcite .",
    "however , the numerical problem becomes quite complex when one increases the number of particle species .",
    "for this reason , and more important because one would like to gain a deeper structural insight into the solutions of ( [ tbae ] ) , it is desirable to obtain analytical solutions to the tba - equations . due to the nonlinear nature of ( [ tbae ] ) only few analytical solutions are known . nonetheless , one may obtain approximated analytical solutions when @xmath8 tends to zero . for large @xmath11 , i.e. for large particle densities ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the integral equation ( [ tbae ] ) may be turned into a set of differential equations of infinite order . under certain natural assumptions , which are however not satisfied universally for all models ,",
    "one may approximate these equations by second order differential equations , whose solutions are given by @xmath22 the restriction on the range of the rapidity stems from the physical requirement @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath2 constants @xmath23 are determined by a power series expansion of the tba kernel @xmath24 the dependence on the scaling parameter @xmath8 enters through the quantity @xmath25 here the @xmath26 are constants of integration .",
    "there is a very crude lower bound we can put immediately on @xmath27 . from the fact that @xmath28 , we deduce @xmath29 . for particular models we will provide below a rigorous argument which establishes that in fact they do not depend on the particle type , such that we may replace @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we will also show that they can be fixed by appealing to the semi - classical approach in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we provide an argument which determines them approximately from within the tba analysis by matching the large and small density regimes .",
    "since the constant turns out to be model dependent , we will report on it in detail below when we discuss concrete theories .",
    "the restriction on the range for the rapidities in ( [ lapp ] ) , for which the large density approximation @xmath32 ceases to be valid , makes it desirable to develop also an approximation for small densities . for extremely small densities",
    "we naturally expect that the solution will tend to the one for a free theory . solving ( [ tbae ] ) for vanishing kernel yields the well - known solution @xmath33",
    "ideally we would like to have expressions for both regions which match at some distinct rapidity value , say @xmath34 , to be specified below .",
    "since @xmath32 and @xmath35 become relatively poor approximations in the transition region between large and small densities , we seek for improved analytical expressions .",
    "this is easily achieved by expanding ( [ tbae ] ) around the `` zero order '' small density approximations . in this case",
    "we obtain the integral representation @xmath36 for vanishing @xmath37 we may check for consistency and observe that the functions @xmath38 become the first term of the expansion in ( [ lf ] ) .",
    "one could try to proceed similarly for the large density regime and develop around @xmath39 instead of @xmath40 .",
    "however , there is an immediate problem resulting from the restriction on the range of rapidities for the validity of @xmath39 , which makes it problematic to compute the convolution .",
    "we shall therefore proceed in a different manner for the large density regime and employ y - systems for this purpose .    in many cases the tba - equations may be expressed equivalently as a set of functional relations referred to as @xmath41-systems in the literature @xcite .",
    "introducing the quantities @xmath42 , the determining equations can always be cast into the general form @xmath43 with @xmath44 being some real number and @xmath45 being a function whose precise form depends on the particular model .",

    "of course this identification is not completely compelling and we could have chosen also a different combination of @xmath41 s .",
    "however , in order to be able to evaluate the @xmath45 we require a concrete functional input for the function @xmath48 in form of an approximated function .",
    "choosing here the large density approximation @xmath49 makes the choice for @xmath45 with hindsight somewhat canonical , since other combinations lead generally to non - physical answers .",
    "we replace now inside the defining relation of @xmath45 the @xmath41 s by @xmath50 .",
    "analogously to the approximating approach in @xcite , we can replace the convolution by an infinite series of differentials @xmath51 where the @xmath52 s are defined by the power series expansion @xmath53 the @xmath54 denote the euler numbers , which enter through the expansion @xmath55 .",
    "in accordance with the assumptions of our previous approximations for the solutions of the tba - equations in the large density approximation , we can neglect all higher order derivatives of the @xmath32 .",
    "thus we only keep the zeroth order in ( [ fteg ] ) . from ( [ f2 g ] )",

    "\\label{ll}\\ ] ] in principle we could proceed similarly for the small density approximation and replace now @xmath58 in the defining relations for the @xmath59 s .",
    "however , in this situation we can not neglect the higher order derivatives of the @xmath60 such that we have to keep the convolution in ( [ fteg ] ) and end up with an integral representation instead .",
    "we now wish to match @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the transition region between the small and large density approximations at some distinct value of the rapidity , say @xmath34 .",
    "we select this point to be the value when the function @xmath62 , which is proportional to the free energy density for a particular particle species , has its maximum in the small density approximation @xmath63 in regard to the quantity we wish to compute , the scaling function ( [ scc ] ) , this is the point in which we would like to have the highest degree of agreement between the exact and approximated solution , since this will optimize the outcome for @xmath64 .",
    "having specified the @xmath34 , the matching condition provides a simple rational to fix the constant @xmath65@xmath66    clearly , in general we can not solve these equations analytically , but it is a trivial numerical problem which is by no means comparable with the one of solving ( [ tbae ] ) .",
    "needless to say that the outcome of ( [ detttt ] ) is not to be considered as exact , but as our examples below demonstrate it will lead to rather good approximations .",
    "one of the reasons why this procedure is successful is that @xmath67 is still very close to the precise solution , despite the fact that is at its worst in comparison with the remaining rapidity range .",
    "combining the improved large and small density approximation we have the following approximated analytical @xmath19-functions for the entire range of the rapidity @xmath68 such that the scaling function becomes well approximated by @xmath69    to develop matters further and report on the quality of @xmath49 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 we have to specify a particular theory at this point .",
    "affine toda field theories @xcite form a well studied class of relativistic integrable quantum field theories in 1 + 1 space - time dimensions .",
    "to each of these field theories a pair of affine lie algebras @xmath73 @xcite is associated whose structure allows universal statements concerning its properties , like the s - matrix , the mass spectrum , the fusing rules , etc . here",
    "@xmath74 denotes a twisted affine lie algebra w.r.t .",
    "a dynkin diagram automorphism of order @xmath75 .",
    "both algebras are chosen to be dual to each other , i.e. @xmath74 is obtained from the non - twisted algebra @xmath76 of rank @xmath2 by exchanging roots and co - roots .",
    "for @xmath76 simply - laced both algebras coincide , i.e. @xmath77 , which is reflected in the quantum theory by a strong - weak self - duality in the coupling constant .",
    "moreover , the mass spectrum renormalises by an overall factor and the poles of the s - matrix in the physical sheet do not depend on the coupling constant . for non - simply laced lie algebras these features cease to be valid .",
    "the quantum masses are now coupling dependent and flow between the classical masses associated with @xmath76 and @xmath74 in the weak and strong coupling limit , respectively .",

    "the constant may be fixed by a direct comparison with a semi - classical treatment of the problem .",
    "it is not necessary for this to proceed to higher order differential equations as was claimed in @xcite .",
    "of course one may proceed further to higher orders , but since the solutions to the higher order differential equations may only be obtained approximately one does not gain any further structural insight and moreover one has lost the virtue of the first order approximation , its simplicity .",
    "we derived the y - systems for all atft and besides demonstrating how they can be utilized to improve on the large density approximations we also showed how they can be used to put constraints on the constant of integration .",
    "we have proven that the expression ( [ capp ] ) for the scaling function is of a general nature , i.e. valid for _ all _ atft .",
    "it is desirable to extend the semi - classical analysis @xcite also to the non - simply laced case .",
    "this would allow to read off the constant @xmath121 also in that case .",
