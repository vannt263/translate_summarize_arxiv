    "the huge progress in nanotechnology which has been made in the last decade reopens the issue of superconducting properties of metallic nanostructures i.e. nanofilms  @xcite , nanowires  @xcite or metallic grains  @xcite .",
    "the studies of the quantum size effect and its influence on the paired phase in thin films was initiated by blatt and thomson in 1963  @xcite .",
    "the main finding of their work  @xcite was the appearance of sharp oscillations of the critical temperature as a function of the film thickness . as it was argued  @xcite this effect results from the confinement of the electron motion in the direction perpendicular to the film .",
    "if the size of the system becomes comparable to the electron wave length , the fermi sphere splits into a set of discrete two - dimensional subbands , energy of which increases with decreasing film thickness .",
    "each time a bottom of a subband passes through the fermi level , a sharp peak of the critical temperature appears . due to technological difficulties in the preparation of uniform films , which were typically polycrystalline and",
    "contained a large number of defects , the experimental observation of the so - called shape resonances has been reported only recently  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the critical temperature for pb(111 ) nanofilms grown on si substrate  @xcite revealed that the period of the thickness - dependent oscillations is equal to @xmath3  ml . additionally , the beating effect with the periodicity varying from @xmath4  ml to @xmath5  ml was observed .",
    "this feature , called bilayer or even - odd oscillations , was theoretically studied by shanenko et al . in ref .",
    "the studies of superconducting properties of the ultra - thin films have been recently extended to the case of high temperature and multiband superconductors .",

    "the experimental reports on the growth techniques of high quality mgb@xmath7 films of thicknesses less than 10  @xmath8  @xcite entailed a series of theoretical papers describing the quantum size effect in multiband thin film superconductors  @xcite .",
    "recent studies devoted to superconductivity in the nanoscale regime concern the effect of the quantum confinement on the superconductor to normal metal phase transition induced by the magnetic field  @xcite . the thickness - dependent oscillations of the perpendicular and parallel critical field for ultra - thin lead films were reported by bao et al . in ref .",

    "<S> moreover , due to the orbital effect , the slope @xmath0 at @xmath1 becomes finite and decreases with increasing film thickness in agreement with recent experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature @xmath2 at which the superconductor to normal metal phase transition becomes of the first order is also analyzed . </S>"
