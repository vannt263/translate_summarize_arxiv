    "in this section , we briefly present the methods we used to derive t@xmath1 , log g and [ fe / h ] : the basel library , two photometric calibrations and a detailed spectroscopic analysis .",
    "the basel stellar library ( basel models ) is constituted of the merging of various synthetic stellar spectra libraries , with the purpose of giving the most comprehensive coverage of stellar parameters .",
    "this is a library of theoretical spectra corrected to provide synthetic colours consistent with empirical colour - temperature calibrations at all wavelengths from the near - uv to the far - ir ( see lejeune et al .",
    "1998 and references therein for a complete description ) .",
    "it has been corrected for systematic deviations detected in respect to ubvrijhklm photometry at solar metallicity , and can then be considered as the state - of - the - art knowledge of the broad band content of stellar spectra .",
    "these model spectra cover a large range of fundamental parameters ( 2000 @xmath6 t@xmath1 @xmath6 50,000 k , @xmath45 @xmath6 [ fe / h ] @xmath6 1 and @xmath41.02 @xmath6 log g @xmath6 5.5 ) and their photometric calibrations are regularly updated and extended to an even larger set of parameters ( see e.g. westera et al .",
    "+ the basel library spectra have been calibrated directly for standard dwarf and giant sequences at solar abundances and using ubvrijhklm broad - band photometry , and are hence expected to provide excellent results in these photometric bands ( see for instance lastennet et al . , 2001b for a recent applications to agb stars in near - infrared jhklm photometry ) .",
    "since they are based on synthetic spectra , they can in principle be used in many other photometric systems taken either individually or simultaneously , and this is another major advantage - used in this work - of these models .",
    "thus , because the basel library has only been calibrated in the ubvrijhklm colours , the best parameters derivations come from this system . whilst parameters derivations in equivalent bandwidth systems such as washington seem to be as good with the basel libraries than with empirical methods ( lejeune 1997 )",
    ", parameter derivations from the basel library in narrow band systems such as strmgren photometry should be of poorer quality .",
    "however , even in this non optimal case , good results were obtained for individual stars of detached eclipsing binaries ( lastennet et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in order to derive simultaneously the effective temperature ( t@xmath1 ) , the metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , and the surface gravity ( log g ) of each star , we minimize a @xmath12 -functional ( see lastennet et al .",
    "2001a for all details ) .",
    "we have also run the `` templogg '' program which is designed to determine effective temperature and log g from either strmgren or geneva photometry . for strmgren",
    "photometry it uses a fortran program written by e. fresno which relies upon the grids of moon & dworetsky ( 1985 ) in the t@xmath13-log g parameter space relevant to this paper , with the improvements by napiwotzki et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . for geneva photometry",
    "it uses a fortran program written by m. kunzli ( see north et al .",
    "the program chooses among eight different regions in the hr diagram for selecting the best calibration within the strmgren system and three different regions for the geneva system .",
    "the results from this method are gathered in table 3 .",

    "the observed spectra were compared with theoretical ones constructed from a combination of kurucz atmospheric models ( atlas9 - mixing length theory of convection with @xmath17 and without overshooting , the vald-2 atomic database ( kupka et al . 1999 ) , and the synth radiative transfer codes ( piskunov 1992 ) and balmer9 ( kurucz 1993 ) ) .",

    "t@xmath1 is therefore obtained for each star of the sample by fitting the observed h@xmath22 line with synthetic spectra computed from a grid of solar metallicity atmospheric models separated by 250k .",
    "within the temperature range that we found , we noticed that fe i absorption lines depend only on temperature and metallicity , being practically independent of the surface gravity , while fe ii lines are sensitive to the temperature , metallicity and gravity .",

    "there is only one exception ( hd 46304 ) : its t@xmath1 is in perfect agreement with its spectroscopic value , but the predicted log g and [ fe / h ] are still low .",
    "while the basel contours are consistent with the templogg gravity only at the 2-@xmath28 level , the metallicity predicted from the basel models is poor in comparison to the result of the templogg calibration ( @xmath27[fe / h]@xmath70.7 ) .",
    "what could explain this persistent difference ?",
    "it is worth noticing that this star has a large v sin@xmath18 ( 200 km s@xmath20 , the largest in our working sample ) , and it is well known that high rotational velocities modify the colours .",
    "since the expected colour effect due to rotation is typically a few hundredths of a magnitude in b@xmath4v and increases with v sin@xmath18 , this is probably part of the reason why the predictions of the basel models disagree with the templogg method for this star . however this explanation is not satisfying because rotation is not taken into account in the templogg method .",
    "+ in conclusion , except in the case discussed before , reliable and simultaneous estimates of the 3 atmospheric parameters can be derived for f - type stars from only the three synthetic basel colours , b@xmath4v , u@xmath4b and b@xmath4y .",
    "this is a very useful criterion for further applications .    a comment on the impressively good accuracy of the basel determinations for the johnson - strmgren b@xmath4v , u@xmath4b , b@xmath4y combination ( see figs .",

    "( 2001a ) .",
    "this is particularly interesting , given the known difficulties of matching empirical and theoretical b@xmath4v - t@xmath1 scales to within better than about 0.03 mag ( see , e.g. , sekiguchi & fukugita , 2000)y index is less vulnerable than b@xmath4v to the secondary effects of surface gravity and metallicity , even at the low spectral resolution given by the model spectra . ] .",
    "it is also well known that if one does not ask ubv data to provide the temperature in the first place ( e.g. , by using an independent source , such as spectroscopy , spectral classification , or else suitable other photometry , such as strmgren b@xmath4y ) , the sensitivities of both u@xmath4b and b@xmath4v can be used to full advantage for determining log g and [ fe / h ] . moreover , although these sensitivities change with temperature , they are near or even at their maxima in the f - dwarf star domain ( e.g. , buser & kurucz 1992 ) .",
    "this means that the derived values of [ fe / h ] and log g presented in figs .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] , [ f : fig2 ] and [ f : fig3 ] are as reliable as they can possibly be , given the uncertainties in the colours .",
    "usually , the basel models provide colours in selected photometric systems , given a set of effective temperature , surface gravity and metallicity ( t@xmath1 , log g , [ fe / h ] ) . the new `` basel interactive server '' , the web version of the basel models hosted by the coimbra observatory since the end of 2000 ( http://tangerine.astro.mat.uc.pt/basel/ ) already provides such information .",
    "we propose to develop in the near future a basic interactive tool based on the inverse method : an automatic tool based on the method of lastennet et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to complete the facilities of the `` basel interactive server '' .",
    "this method would be applied to the @xmath19 1000 remaining potential targets of the corot exploratory programme to provide their fundamental stellar parameters as discussed by lastennet , lejeune & cuisinier ( 2001 ) .",

    "we also note that the agreement between templogg and basel for the hottest stars of the sample could be especially useful in view of the well known difficulty of spectroscopic determinations for fast rotating stars . +",
