    "cell alice can change @xmath303 into @xmath304 at time @xmath204 , leading to a perfectly measurable change from @xmath305 to @xmath306 for bob . again",
    "another way to say it is that operators localized upon cell @xmath126 are not taken to operators localized upon cells @xmath214 and @xmath126 , as was the case for qca . for instance",
    "take @xmath307 localized upon cell @xmath126 .",
    "this is taken to @xmath308 .",
    "but this operation is not localized upon cells @xmath214 and @xmath126 , as it takes @xmath309 to @xmath310 , whatever the position @xmath161 of the varying @xmath311 . + now let us take a step back . if a ca is not structurally reversible , there is no chance that its qca will be .",
    "moreover according the current state of modern physics , quantum mechanics is the theory for describing all closed systems .",
    "therefore we reach the following proposition .",
    "the class of bijective but not structurally reversible ca upon finite configurations is known to coincide with the class of surjective but non injective ca upon infinite configurations , or again the class of bijective ca upon finite configurations but not upon infinite configuration .",
    "call it @xmath135 .",
    "+ the quantization of a class @xmath135 automata is not local .",
    "it can not be implemented by a series of finite closed quantum systems .",
    "as far as ca are concerned this result removes much of the motivation of several papers which focus upon class @xmath135 .",
    "as regards qca the structure theorem removes much of the motivation of the papers @xcite , which contain unitary decision procedures for possibly non - structurally reversible qca .",
    "+ _ faster quantum signalling . _ + second , it is a well - known fact that there exists some radius @xmath312 , structurally reversible ca , whose inverse is also of radius @xmath312 , and yet which do not admit a two - layered block representation unless the cells are grouped into supercells . the toffoli ca is a good example of that .",
    "let @xmath185 be the set of finite configurations over the alphabet @xmath313 , with @xmath314 now taken as the quiescent symbol .",
    "for all @xmath315 and @xmath316 taken in the alphabet let @xmath317 .",
    "we call @xmath281 the function mapping @xmath282 to @xmath283 .",
    "this is best described by figure [ toffoli ] .    ]",
    "the toffoli ca is clearly shift - invariant , and of radius @xmath312 .",
    "let us check that its inverse is also of radius @xmath312 .",
    "for instance say we seek to retrieve ( c , d ) .",
    "@xmath178 is easy of course . by shift - invariance",
    "retrieving @xmath318 is like retrieving @xmath319 .",
    "but since we have @xmath320 and @xmath318 in cleartext we can easily substract @xmath321 from @xmath322 . now why does it not have a two - layered block representation without cell grouping ?",
    "remember the toffoli gate is the controlled - controlled - not gate . here",
    "@xmath319 is noted depending upon @xmath320 and @xmath178 , which pass through unchanged , same for @xmath318 with the left and right neighbouring subcells , etc .",
    "so actually the toffoli ca is just two layers of the toffoli gate , as we have shown in figure [ toffoli ] .",
    "but we know that the toffoli gate can not be obtained from two bit gates in classical reversible electronics , hence there can not be a two - layered block representation without cell grouping .",
    "+ so classically there exists some structurally reversible ca , of radius @xmath312 , whose inverse is also of radius @xmath312 , but do not admit a two - layered block representation without cell grouping . yet surely , just by defining @xmath293 over @xmath186 by linear extension we ought to have a qca , together with its block representation , and that construction does not need any cell grouping , hence again the apparent paradox . + again in order to lift this concern let us look at the properties of this quantized @xmath295 .",
    "it is indeed unitary and shift - invariant of course .",
    "this time it is also local , but counter - intuitively it turns out not to be of radius @xmath312 . indeed from the formulation in terms of toffoli gates as in figure [ toffoli ] one can show that the radius is @xmath323 in a quantum mechanical setting .",
    "for instance one can check that putting @xmath305 in the @xmath320-subcell , @xmath306 in the @xmath319-subcell , and either @xmath324 or @xmath325 in the @xmath178-subcell of fig .",
    "[ toffoli ] at time @xmath204 will yield either @xmath305 or @xmath306 in the @xmath320-subcell at time @xmath202 .",
    "+ once more let us take a step back .",
    "the toffoli ca is yet another case where exploiting quantum superpositions of configurations enables us to have information flowing faster than in the classical setting , just like for the xor ca .",
    "but unlike the xor ca , the speed of information remains bounded in the toffoli ca , and so up to cell grouping it can still be considered a qca . therefore we reach the following proposition .",
    "let @xmath281 be a ca and @xmath295 the corresponding qca , as obtained by linear extension of @xmath293 .",
    "information may flow faster in the the quantized version of @xmath293 .",
    "this result is certainly intriguing , and one may wonder whether it might contain the seed of a novel development quantum information theory , as opposed to its classical counterpart .    _",
    "no - go for @xmath205-dimensions .",
    "_ + finally , it is again well - known that in two - dimensions there exists some structurally reversible ca which do not admit a two - layered block representation , even after a cell - grouping .",
    "the standard example is that of kari @xcite :    let @xmath185 be the set of finite configurations over the alphabet @xmath326 , with @xmath327 is now taken as the quiescent symbol .",
    "so each cell is made of @xmath328 bits , one for each cardinal direction ( north , north - east  ) plus one bit in the center , as in figure [ kari0 ] . at each time step ,",
    "the north bit of a cell undergoes a @xmath329 only if the cell lying north has center bit equal to @xmath126 , the north - east bit of a cell undergoes a @xmath329 only if the cell lying north - east has center bit equal to @xmath126 , and so on .",
    "call @xmath293 this ca .",
    "cells.[kari0 ] ]     and @xmath330.[kari1 ] ]     and @xmath178 : a contradiction.[kari2 ] ]    this is clearly shift - invariant , local and structurally reversible . informally",
    "the proof that the kari ca does not admit a a two - layered block representation , even if we group cells into supercells , runs as follows @xcite : + - suppose @xmath293 admits a decomposition into @xmath78 and @xmath96 blocks ; + - consider cells @xmath331 such that they are all neighbours ; @xmath278 are in the same @xmath96-block but not @xmath332 ; @xmath333 and @xmath334 are not in the same @xmath78-block , as in figure [ kari0 ] ; + - consider @xmath335 the configuration with @xmath126 as the center bit of @xmath333 and zero everywhere .",
    "run the @xmath78-blocks , the hatched zone left of figure [ kari1 ] represents those cells which may not be all zeros ; + - consider the configuration obtained from the previous @xmath336 by putting to zero anything which lies not the @xmath96-block of @xmath332 , as in figure [ kari1 ] .",
    "call it @xmath330 , and let @xmath178 be defined as the antecedent of @xmath178 under a run of the @xmath78-blocks ; + - on the one hand we know that @xmath337 is obtained from a run of the @xmath96-blocks from @xmath330 . in the left @xmath96-block",
    "there are just zeroes so @xmath337 has only zeroes , in particular the north bit of the @xmath338 cell is @xmath214 .",
    "but the right @xmath96-block is exactly the same as that of @xmath336 , and so we know that the north - west bit of the @xmath338 cell of @xmath337 is @xmath126 , as in the left of figure [ kari2 ] ; + - on the other hand since @xmath330 has zeroes everywhere but in the above @xmath78-block , the same is true of @xmath178 , as shown right of the figure [ kari2 ] .",
    "a consequence of this is that the north bit of the @xmath338 cell must be equal to the north - west bit of the @xmath332 cells , as they are both obtained from the same function ofs the center bit of the @xmath333 cell ; + - hence the contradiction .",
    "+ now by defining @xmath293 over @xmath186 by linear extension we have a qca , and the proof applies in a very similar fashion , the contradiction being that the state of the north qubit of the @xmath338 cell must be equal to the state of the north - west bit of the @xmath332 cells , whether these are mixed states or not .",
    "hence we have a counterexample to the higher - dimensional case of the theorem in @xcite .",
    "we reach the following proposition .",
    "there exists some @xmath240-dimensional qca which do not admit a two - layered block representation .",

    "<S> as an example we discuss a bijective cellular automata which becomes non - local as a qca , in a rare case of reversible computation which does not admit a straightforward quantization . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that a whole class of bijective cellular automata should no longer be considered to be reversible in a physical sense . </S>",
    "<S> note that the same two - layered block representation result applies also over infinite configurations , as was previously shown for one - dimensional systems in the more elaborate formalism of operators algebras @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the proof is made simpler and self - contained , moreover we discuss a counterexample qca in higher dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> one - dimensional cellular automata ( ca ) consist in a line of cells , each of which may take one in a finite number of possible states . </S>",
    "<S> these evolve in discrete time steps according to a local , shift - invariant function . when defined over infinite configurations , the inverse of a bijective ca is then itself a ca , and this structural reversibility leads to a natural block decomposition of the ca . </S>",
    "<S> none of this holds over finite , yet possibly unbounded , configurations .    </S>",
    "<S> because ca are a physics - like model of computation it seems very natural to study their quantum extensions . </S>",
    "<S> the flourishing research in quantum information and quantum computer science provides us with appropriate context for doing so , both in terms of the potential implementation and the theoretical framework . </S>",
    "<S> right from the very birth of the field with feynman s 1986 paper , it was hoped that qca may prove an important path to realistic implementations of quantum computers @xcite  mainly because they eliminate the need for an external , classical control and hence the principal source of decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> other possible aims include providing models of distributed quantum computation , providing bridges between computer science notions and modern theoretical physics , or anything like understanding the dynamics of some quantum physical system in discrete spacetime , i.e. from an idealized viewpoint . </S>",
    "<S> studying qca rather than quantum turing machines for instance means we bother about the spatial structure of things @xcite , whether for the purpose of describing a quantum protocol , modelling a quantum physical phenomena , or again taking into account the spatial parallelism inherent to the model .    </S>",
    "<S> one - dimensional quantum cellular automata ( qca ) consist in a line of identical , finite dimensional quantum systems . </S>",

    "<S> we mean that information can not be transmitted faster that a fixed number of cells per time step . </S>",
    "<S> because the standard mathematical setting for quantum mechanics is the theory of hilbert spaces , we must exhibit and work with a countable basis for our vectorial space . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason why we restrict to finite , unbounded configurations . </S>",
    "<S> an elegant alternative to this restriction is to abandon hilbert spaces altogether and use the more abstract mathematical setting of @xmath0-algebras @xcite  but here we seek to make our proofs self - contained and accessible to a wider community , including those computer scientists with an interest in quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is that qca can always be expressed as two layers of an infinitely repeating unitary gate even over such finite configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of such a two - layered block representation implies of course that the inverse qca is again a qca . </S>",
    "<S> our result is mainly a simplification of the same theorem over infinite configurations as expressed with operators algebra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately an example qca disproves the theorem in further dimensions  at least in its present form .    </S>",
    "<S> it is a rather striking fact however that qca admit the two - layered block representation in spite of their being defined over finite , unbounded configurations . for most purposes this saves us from complicated unitary tests such as @xcite . but </S>",
    "<S> more importantly notice how this is clearly not akin to the classical case , where a ca may be bijective over such finite configurations , and yet not structurally reversible . in order to clarify this situation </S>",
    "<S> we consider a perfectly valid , bijective ca but whose inverse function is not a ca . </S>",
    "<S> it then turns out that its quantum version is no longer valid , as it allows superluminal signalling . hence whilst we are used to think that any reversible computation admits a trivial quantization , this turns out not to be case in the realm of cellular automata . </S>",
    "<S> curiously the non - locality of quantum states ( entanglement ) induces more structure upon the cellular automata  </S>",
    "<S> so that its evolution may remain local as an operation ( no - superluminal signalling ) . based upon these remarks </S>",
    "<S> we prove that an important , well - studied class of bijective ca may be dismissed as not physically reversible .    </S>",
    "<S> _ outline . </S>",
    "<S> _ we reorganize a number of known mathematical results around the notion of subsystems in quantum theory ( section [ subsystems ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to this small theory we prove the reversibility / block structure theorem in an elementary manner ( section [ blocks ] ) . in the discussion we show why the theorem does not hold as such in further dimensions ; we exhibit superluminal signalling in the xor quantum automata , and end with a general theorem discarding all injective , non surjective ca over infinite configurations as unphysical ( section [ discussion ] ) . </S>"
