    "the studies for two - body charmless @xmath9 decays have raised a lot of interests among the particle physics community .",

    "this immediately surges a considerable amount of theoretical attentions to study nonperturbative features or to look for the possibility of having new physics  ( np ) in order to explain several discrepancies between the data and the standard model  ( sm ) based calculations  @xcite .    from the existing sm calculations for the charmless @xmath12 modes",
    ", it is known that the amplitude , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , with two vector mesons in the longitudinal polarization state is much greater than those in transverse polarization states , since the latter are found to be @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 in the transversity basis )  @xcite . for the @xmath9",
    "meson decays , the relation for different helicity amplitudes is modified as @xmath17 .",
    "nevertheless , recently babar  @xcite first observed sizable transverse fractions in the @xmath18 decays , where the transverse polarization amplitudes are comparable to the longitudinal one .",
    "this result was confirmed later by belle  @xcite . in other words , in terms of helicity amplitudes the data show that @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 $ ] , @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath22 is the typical hadronic scale .",
    "this in turn may enhance the transverse amplitudes required to explain the anomaly .",
    "however , in the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) framework , li and mishima  @xcite have shown that the annihilations are still not sufficient to enhance transverse fractions . another possibility for explaining the polarization anomaly advocated by colangelo _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite is the existence of large charming penguin and final state interaction ( fsi ) effects .",
    "however they got @xmath23 , in contrast to the observations @xcite , where the normalization @xmath24 is adopted . with the similar fsi scenario , cheng _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath25 , which is also in contrast to the recent data  @xcite .",
    "now the question is : is it possible to explain this anomaly by the np ?",
    "if yes , what types of np operators one should consider ?",
    "some np related models have been proposed  @xcite , where the so - called right - handed currents @xmath26 were emphasized  @xcite .",
    "if the right - handed currents contribute constructively to @xmath27 but destructively to @xmath28 , then one may have larger @xmath29 to account for the data . however the resulting @xmath30  @xcite will be in contrast to the recent observations  @xcite .",

    "the second class consists of operators with structures @xmath34 and @xmath35 , from which the resulting amplitudes read as @xmath36 . moreover , the above ( pseudo-)scalar operators can be written in terms of their companions , the ( axial-)tensor operators , by fierz transformation .",
    "finally , there is only one effective coefficient relevant for each class .",
    "we find that these two classes can separately satisfy the two possible solutions for polarization phase data , which is due to the phase ambiguity in the measurement , and the anomaly for large transverse fractions can thus be resolved .",

    "the reason for choosing the two classes of operators with structures ( i ) @xmath38 and ( ii ) @xmath39 is explained and the relevant calculations arising from these operators are performed . we discuss the possibility for the existence of right - handed currents @xmath40 which was emphasized in  @xcite . from the point of view of helicity conservation in the strong interactions , we discuss various contributions originating from the chromomagnetic dipole operator , charming penguin mechanism , and annihilations .",
