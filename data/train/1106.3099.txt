    "goldfeld s conjecture , in its original form , makes an assertion about a family of elliptic curves over a number field and some form of rank . for example",
    ", if we fix an elliptic curve @xmath5 and consider the set of its quadratic twists ordered by ( increasing ) discriminant of the twisting fields , then the conjecture asserts that the average rank of the first @xmath6 curves tends to the limit @xmath3 as @xmath6 tends to infinity . in this paper we will fix the rational function field @xmath7 as our base field and consider families of elliptic curves over @xmath8 for which we can calculate each family member s analytic rank",
    "little theoretical progress has been made when we consider the average rank of an ` increasing ' sequence of curves , and the genesis of this paper lies in a computational project to generate a rich data set of @xmath4-functions for studying the ( empirical ) averages .    in the bulk of this paper we focus on some algorithms of increasing complexity for explicitly calculating the @xmath4-function @xmath9 for an elliptic curve @xmath10 ; the increasing complexity allows for increased speed but at the cost of increasing the disk and memory space requirements .",
    "in contrast to @xmath4-functions over number fields , these @xmath4-functions have the remarkable property that if we define a new variable @xmath11 by @xmath12 , then we can represent the @xmath4-function as a polynomial @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the analytic rank of @xmath10 is simply the order of vanishing at @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , hence the analytic goldfeld s conjecture requires only a miniscule amount of the information present in each @xmath4-function .",
    "however , there are many other questions one can ask about how @xmath16 varies with @xmath10 , so we hope that our database and algorithms will prove useful for others .    for the calculation of a single @xmath4-function , one can use the theory outlined in the first two sections of section  [ sec::ec ] .",
    "we follow the usual approach for calculating the @xmath4-function by expressing it as an euler product ; the terms of the product are indexed by valuations in @xmath8 , i.e.  by monic irreducibles in the polynomial ring @xmath17 $ ] and a point at infinity .",
    "the euler product is infinite , but there is a finite collection of euler factors that completely determine @xmath16 . to compute the @xmath4-function as efficiently as possible ( in this approach )",
    "we want to minimize the size of this collection ( e.g.  by using a functional equation ) and the cost of computing a single euler factor .",
    "those who have experience computing quadratic twists know that the cost of computing an euler factor for a twist is much cheaper if one knows the euler factor for the original curve , the work being reduced to computing a legendre symbol .",
    "a similar efficiency emerges when we consider pullbacks , i.e.  when we replace @xmath8 with a finite extension @xmath18 : almost all of the euler factors for @xmath19 can be cheaply calculated from the euler factors of @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , for each @xmath20 , there is an elliptic curve @xmath21 over @xmath22 such that every @xmath10 may be written as the combination of a pullback of @xmath21 to @xmath8 ( via the embedding @xmath23 induced by @xmath24 ) and a twist ( by quadratic @xmath18 ) .",
    "in particular , the euler factors for @xmath16 may be cheaply computed from the euler factors of @xmath25 , and the second half of section  [ sec::ec ] explains this in detail .",
    "the upshot is that whenever we construct a new curve @xmath10 as a pullback or twist of another curve @xmath26 , then the additional cost of computing @xmath16 using a precomputed table of sufficiently many euler factors for @xmath25 is much cheaper than if we computed @xmath16 from scratch .",
    "we have written a library for calculating @xmath4-functions whose core routines use the methods we outline in section  [ sec::ec ] and recently provided the wrapper routines for it to be used within sage   @xcite . the library is called ellff  ( for elliptic @xmath4-functions over function fields ) , and we describe its basic structure in section  [ sec::ellff ] .",

    "the remarkable property that the @xmath4-function of a non - isotrivial elliptic curve over a function field is a polynomial yields an effective algorithm to determine its coefficients by computing the number of points on a finite number of fibers .",
    "these fibers precisely correspond to the euler factors that determine @xmath16 , and by realizing a given curve as a quadratic twist or pullback of another curve , the number of euler factors that need to be computed can be minimized .",
    "in particular , the versal elliptic curve provides a ( non - canonical ) choice for an elliptic curve from which one can pullback and twist to recover any given elliptic curve , allowing for the efficient computation of the given curve s @xmath4-function provided sufficiently many euler factors have been precomputed .",
    "these algorithms have been developed into ellff , a software library for the open - source mathematical software system sage , allowing anyone to quickly compute such @xmath4-functions .",
    "experimentally , we computed the @xmath4-functions of four different families of quadratic twists in order to examine their analytic ranks for numerical evidence pertaining to goldfeld s conjecture . using an elementary argument",
    ", we know the asymptotic average rank over our family of quadratic twists is at least @xmath3 as the degree of the twisting polynomial becomes arbitrarily large .",
    "unlike the situation in number fields , the case of function fields provides strong evidence , especially for the largest data sets , that this average is indeed @xmath3 , thus supporting the validity of goldfeld s conjecture in the function field case .",
    "moreover , the experimental data also suggests that the analytic ranks are distributed closely with the density conjecture s prediction .",
    "nonetheless the presence of a non - trivial amount of curves of rank at least 2 in even the largest data sets may suggest the convergence to this distribution is rather slow .",

    "there is much work left to be done  both theoretical and computational  for the case of function fields , but we believe the example of @xmath4-functions of elliptic curves indicates that the effort is worthwhile and yields interesting mathematics .    xxxx99a    b.  bektemirov , b.  mazur , w.  stein , m.  watkins , `` average ranks of elliptic curves : tension between data and conjecture .
