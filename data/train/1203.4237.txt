    "this has been interpreted as the fingerprint of a recent minor merger between the s0 galaxy and a gas - rich dwarf galaxy ( s10 ) , whose nucleus may be identified with the counterpart of hlx-1 .",
    "the presence of prominent dust lanes around the nucleus of eso  243 - 49 ( f12 ) is another hint of a recent gas - rich merger ( e.g. , finkelman et al .",
    "2010 ; shabala et al .",
    "the possibility that minor mergers switch on hyperluminous x - ray sources ( hlxs , i.e. ulxs with x - ray luminosity -assumed isotropic- @xmath18 erg s@xmath5 ) was initially proposed by king & dehnen ( 2005 , see also bellovary et al .",

    "( _ hst _ ) and very large telescope ( vlt ) photometry ( f12 ; s12 ) . the uv emission from the counterpart of hlx-1",
    "was also found to be variable ( s12 ) .    the nature of the hlx-1 counterpart is still debated .",
    "fits to the _ hst _ data ( f12 ) indicate a total stellar mass of @xmath19 m@xmath8 , whereas both a very young ( @xmath20 myr ) and a very old ( @xmath21 gyr ) age are possible .",
    "an intermediate - age solution is not allowed . in the case of a very young stellar population minimal reprocessing from the disc",
    "is required , whereas the old population explanation predicts that most of blue / uv emission comes from disc irradiation ( f12 ) .",
    "on the basis of vlt data , s12 show that the optical / uv component is variable and therefore dominated by disc irradiation , and exclude the scenario of a @xmath22 m@xmath8 young star cluster .",
    "the two remaining scenarios for the counterpart are a old @xmath23 m@xmath8 star cluster ( likely a globular cluster ) and a @xmath24 m@xmath8 young star cluster .",
    "the latter explanation is complicated by the fact that such small star clusters unlikely host very massive ( @xmath25 m@xmath8 ) bhs ( e.g. , portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ) .",
    "a further issue is represented by the observed x - ray variability of hlx-1 , with a semi - regular period of @xmath26 days ( servillat et al .",
    "2011 ) , and by the mechanism driving the accretion .",
    "lasota et al .",
    "( 2011 , hereafter l11 ) propose that the observed x - ray variability may reflect the orbital period of the companion star . in this case , the outbursts are triggered by periastron passages for a sufficiently eccentric orbit of the companion star ( so that the tidal disruption radius is of the order of the periapsis distance ) .",
    "considering the high mass transfer rate required to power hlx-1 ( @xmath27 m@xmath8 yr@xmath5 ) , l11 suggest that the companion star of the imbh can be an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star and that its mass can not be too small ( @xmath28 m@xmath8 ) .    in this paper , we propose a new interpretation connected with the minor merger scenario ( initially proposed by s10 ) .",
    "we investigate , through @xmath0body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations , the possibility that the optical counterpart of hlx-1 is the nucleus of a gas - rich low - mass late - type galaxy , undergoing merger with eso 243 - 49 . in line with this interpretation , we suggest that hlx-1 is associated with the central bh of the disrupted galaxy and with its surrounding nuclear star cluster ( nc ) .",
    "this entails that the counterpart of hlx-1 consists mainly of very old ( @xmath29 gyr ) stars , but has also a younger population .",
    "in fact , ncs are known to have multiple stellar populations ( rossa et al .",
    "2006 ; walcher et al .",
    "2006 ) , generally dominated by a old component , but where a fraction of young stars is also present ( e.g. , the case of the milky way , see pfuhl et al .",
    "our simulations show that the overall scenario in which hlx-1 is the nucleus of a stripped , gas - rich low - mass galaxy is consistent with the available observations .",
    "a minor merger scenario between the s0 and a gas - rich low - mass galaxy would naturally explain the uv emission and the dust lanes observed in the central region of eso 243 - 49 , as well as ( at least ) part of the uv emission in coincidence with the hlx-1 counterpart .",
    "furthermore , a minor merger scenario has other intriguing implications .",
    "for example , the counterpart of hlx-1 can be identified with the nucleus of the disrupting galaxy .",
    "this provides a possible explanation for the mass of the bh in hlx-1 , as the nuclei of dwarf galaxies have long been suspected to harbour the low - mass tail of super - massive bhs ( smbhs , see , e.g. , barth et al .",
    "2004 ; peterson et al . 2005",
    "; van wassenhove et al . 2010 ; reines et al . 2011 ) .",
    "recent studies ( graham 2012a , 2012b ) indicate that , in low - mass galaxies , the mass of the central bh scales approximately with the square of the host spheroid mass ( rather than linearly , as was usually thought , e.g. marconi & hunt 2003 ) , implying that low - mass galaxies with a @xmath30 m@xmath8 bulge can host bhs with a mass @xmath31 m@xmath8 , consistent with the expected mass of the bh in hlx-1 . finally , nuclei of galaxies in this mass range frequently host ncs ( e.g. , bker et al .",

    "the presence of a central bh and that of a nc do not seem to be mutually exclusive : in addition to the milky way ( e.g. , schdel , merritt & eckart 2009 and references there ) , filippenko & ho ( 2003 ) identified at least one galaxy ( ngc  4395 ) hosting both a smbh and a nc , and graham & driver ( 2007 ) subsequently reported the existence of two additional such galaxies ( ngc  3384 and ngc  7457 ) .",

    "( 2008 , 2009 ) , seth et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and graham & spitler ( 2009 ) . unlike most of the galactic globular clusters , ncs have often a complex sf history , with multiple episodes of sf ( rossa et al .",
    "2006 ; walcher et al .",
    "this suggests the possibility that the colours of the hlx-1 counterpart are the result of multiple populations , dominated by old stars , but with a smaller contribution by very young stars ( plus possibly emission from x - ray reprocessing in the disc ) .",
    "we therefore simulate different scenarios for the merger between a s0 galaxy and a gas - rich companion , to check whether the simulated kinematics and sf history match the observed properties of eso 243 - 49 and of the counterpart of hlx-1 .",
    "the initial conditions for both the primary galaxy ( i.e. the model of eso 243 - 49 ) and the secondary galaxy are generated by using an upgraded version of the code described in widrow , pym & dubinski ( 2008 ; see also kuijken & dubinski 1995 and widrow & dubinski 2005 ) .",
    "the code generates self - consistent disc - bulge - halo galaxy models , derived from explicit distribution functions for each component , that are very close to equilibrium .",
    "in particular , the halo is modelled as a navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 , nfw ) profile .",
    "we use an exponential disc model ( hernquist 1993 ) , while the bulge is spherical and comes from a generalization of the sersic law ( prugniel & simien 1997 ; widrow et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "both the primary and the secondary galaxy have a stellar bulge and a stellar disc .",
    "the giant s0 galaxy has no gas , whereas the secondary galaxy has an initial gas mass of @xmath33 m@xmath8 , distributed according to an exponential disc .",
    "therefore , the initial configuration of the secondary galaxy is consistent with a low - mass gas - rich disc galaxy .",
    "the total mass of the secondary is @xmath34 of the mass of the primary , classifying the outcome of the interaction as a minor merger .",
    "the masses of the various components and the characteristics lengths of the simulated galaxies are listed in table  1 .    here , we report the results of two different runs , in which the masses and scale lengths of each galaxy are the same ( as described in table  1 ) , but their orbital properties ( impact parameter , relative velocity , orientation angles and total energy , listed in table  2 ) are different .",
    "the main common orbital feature between the two runs is that the centre of mass ( cm ) of the secondary galaxy is assumed to lie approximately on the same plane as the disc of the primary galaxy ( in run  a they initially lie exactly on the same plane , whereas in run  b there is an initial shift of 2 kpc ) .",
    "this was required as the offset between the hlx-1 counterpart and the disc of the s0 galaxy is relatively small ( @xmath10 kpc ) .",
    "we initially set the cm of the secondary galaxy at a distance of @xmath35 kpc and @xmath36 kpc from the cm of the primary in runs  a and b , respectively ( table  2 ) . these distances are larger than two virial radii of the primary .",
    "the adopted orbits are nearly parabolic ( run  a is slightly hyperbolic and run  b is slightly bound ) and with very high eccentricity ( table  2 ) , in agreement with predictions from cosmological simulations ( khochfar & burkert 2006 ) .",
    "the particle mass in the primary galaxy is @xmath37 m@xmath8 and @xmath38 m@xmath8 for dark matter ( dm ) and stars , respectively .",

    "we converted the simulated values of @xmath87 into an estimate of the apparent @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 band magnitudes in the johnson system , by assuming that the luminosity distance of eso  243 - 49 is 95 mpc , by adopting a chabrier imf ( chabrier 2001 ) , and by using the padova galaxies and single stellar population models4 ( galadriel ; girardi et al .",
    "2000 ) for a nearly solar metallicity ( @xmath107 ) stellar population .",
    "we stress that this procedure applied to n - body / sph simulations can not be very precise , as it is limited by the intrinsic resolution of sfr and stellar ages in the simulations .",
    "we find that , at @xmath108 gyr after the first pericentre passage , the apparent @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 magnitudes associated to @xmath87 are @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 for run  a , and @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 for run  b. the corresponding values reported by s12 for the counterpart of hlx-1 are @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "thus , run  b at @xmath118 gyr after the first pericentre passage is consistent with the vlt observations of the hlx-1 counterpart .",
    "the strongest constraint comes from the @xmath104 band , as the population associated with the simulated secondary galaxy is predominantly old .",
    "we expect that part of the light in the @xmath106 and @xmath105 bands is contributed by disc reprocessing .",
    "instead , the nucleus of the secondary galaxy in run  a is still too bright at @xmath108 gyr to match the observed photometry of the hlx-1 counterpart .",
    "we conclude that either the orbit simulated in run  a is not consistent with the evolution of hlx-1 , or the elapsed time since the first pericentre passage is longer than 4 gyr .",
    "therefore , the comparison between the luminosity of the simulated galaxy and the observed vlt photometry gives important constraints for the minor - merger scenario .",
    "in particular , the properties of the hlx-1 counterpart can be reproduced only if ( i ) a time @xmath118 gyr elapsed since the first pericentre passage , or ( ii ) the orbit of the secondary galaxy is at least as bound as the orbit adopted in run  b ( because a more bound orbit implies a faster tidal stripping , as the secondary galaxy undergoes more pericentre passages in a shorter time ) , or ( iii ) the mass ratio between the primary and the secondary galaxy is initially @xmath119 ( but galaxies significantly smaller than our simulated secondary galaxy are unlikely to host imbhs at their centre ) .    furthermore , our simulations suggest that the counterpart of hlx-1 is surrounded by a diffuse stellar halo , as @xmath120 for most snapshots .",
    "thus , it is very important to assess whether the counterpart of hlx-1 is a completely naked star cluster or is surrounded by such diffuse stellar halo .",
    "the existence of such halo is not immediately evident from either _ hst _ or vlt images ( f12;s12 ) .",
    "this may be an issue for our model .",
    "on the other hand , from our simulations we expect the surrounding halo to be two ( or more ) magnitudes arcsec@xmath121 fainter than the central nc , i.e. very difficult to disentangle from the background contribution of the s0 galaxy",
    ". we must be very careful in interpreting what occurs at the ( barely resolved ) very centre of the simulated secondary galaxy , as spurious numerical effects can affect density profiles and tidal stripping . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will investigate ( through a wider grid of simulations ) for which orbital parameters the merger scenario can reproduce the observed photometry of the hlx-1 counterpart .",
    "the total mass of gas in the inner kpc of the secondary galaxy after the first pericentre passage is @xmath122 m@xmath8 ( whereas most of the gas is already stripped in the tidal streams ) and decreases by a factor of @xmath123 in the next 4 gyr ( table  4 ) .",
    "interestingly , the total mass of young stars bound to the secondary galaxy ( defined as stellar particles younger than 200 myr ) is of the order of @xmath124 m@xmath8 in the first gyr after the first pericentre passage and drops to @xmath24 m@xmath8 in the following gyrs .",
    "we stress that most of the young stars bound to the secondary galaxy are located in the inner 0.35 kpc , being much more concentrated than the old stars ( table  4 ) .",
    "a young stellar component of @xmath125 m@xmath8 is in agreement with the recent observations published by s12 .",
    "the two high - resolution simulations described in the previous sections provide important hints for eso 249 - 43 , but do not allow any statistically significant considerations .",
    "on the other hand , it is noticeable that two simulations with completely different orbital properties ( table  2 ) give similar results , indicating that the evolution we describe is quite common for interactions between gas - rich dwarfs and s0 galaxies .",
    "interestingly , the main features of our runs  a and b ( i.e. timescales , sf evolution and gas dynamics ) are in agreement with the relatively low - resolution simulations of the galmer database ( di matteo et al . 2007 ; chilingarian et al . 2010 , and references therein ) . in particular",
    ", if we select out of the galmer database the 36 runs describing an interaction between a giant s0 galaxy and a gas - rich disc dwarf galaxy , we can make the following remarks .",
    "( i ) more than half of the considered galmer simulations ( especially those with a retrograde orbit and the highest specific energy ) develop the formation of a dense gas ring surrounding the bulge of the s0 galaxy , very similar to the one showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "( ii ) the interaction triggers the sf , initially at the centre of the secondary galaxy and , at later epochs , even in the nucleus of the primary : the sfr reaches ( on average ) a value of @xmath126 m@xmath8 yr@xmath5 , higher than in our simulation .",
    "however , this discrepancy can be explained by the different resolution ( mass resolution in our runs is a factor of @xmath123 higher ) , by the different sf recipes and especially by the fact that the total gas mass is a factor of @xmath127 higher in the galmer sample than in our simulations .",
    "( iii ) the average time spent by the simulated systems in a configuration similar to eso 243 - 49 ( i.e. in a configuration where the nucleus of the secondary is at @xmath128 kpc projected distance from the centre of the s0 galaxy and where sf occurs in the nucleus of the s0 ) is @xmath79 myr , with respect to an average total duration of the merger of @xmath129 gyr ( that is the average duration of mergers in the considered galmer simulations ) .",
    "thus , we can estimate that a s0 galaxy interacting with a secondary galaxy is in a ` eso  243 - 49-like configuration ' for a fraction @xmath130 of the duration of the merger .",
    "there are substantial differences between our simulations and the galmer sample : the mass - ratio between the secondary galaxy and the s0 galaxy is a factor of 2 larger in the galmer database with respect to our simulations , the baryon - to - dm ratio is up to a factor of @xmath20 higher than in our simulations , the orbits span a slightly different parameter space with respect to ours ( in galmer @xmath131 , and @xmath132 is always slightly higher than our values ) , the recipes for sf are quite different , and the mass resolution is a factor of @xmath123 lower . taking into account all these differences , the agreement between the main features of our simulations and those of the galmer database is noticeable .      in this section , we estimate the density of ulxs similar to hlx-1 ( hereafter , we will call them hlx - like sources , for simplicity ) , under the hypothesis that they are associated with a minor merger , and that they have an outburst x - ray luminosity @xmath133 erg s@xmath5 ( i.e. , the minimum x - ray luminosity for a source to be defined a hlx , see e.g. king & dehnen 2005 ) . in particular , we assume that the host of a hlx - like source is a gas - rich low - mass galaxy , undergoing merger with a giant galaxy . the requests that the secondary galaxy is gas rich and undergoing merger are motivated by the fact that a gas - rich merger is needed to trigger sf .",
    "in addition , we assume that the secondary galaxy has initially a stellar bulge in the @xmath30 m@xmath8 range , i.e. the mass range of bulges that might host a central bh with mass @xmath134 m@xmath8 and a nc ( graham 2012a , 2012b ) .",
    "we define @xmath135 as the stellar mass density of bulges that host hlx - like sources .",
    "@xmath135 can be estimated as    @xmath136    where @xmath137 is the hubble parameter ( @xmath138 according to the seven - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data , larson et al .",
    "2011 ) , @xmath139 is the fraction of the merger timescale during which the nucleus of the secondary galaxy is sufficiently close to the disc of the primary ( see previous section ) .",
    "@xmath140 is the mass density of bulges in the local universe ( @xmath141 , according to driver et al .",
    "@xmath142 is the mass fraction of bulges in the @xmath30 m@xmath8 range ( i.e. , those that might host central bhs in the @xmath134 m@xmath8 range , graham 2012a ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath143 , according to the schechter formalism ( driver et al .",
    "2007 ; li & white 2009 ) .",
    "@xmath144 is the fraction of bulges in the @xmath30 m@xmath8 range that host both the central massive bh and a nc .",
    "we adopt @xmath145 , although this represents likely an upper limit ( see , e.g. , van wassenhove et al .",
    "2010 , but graham & spitler 2009 indicate that @xmath144 may be of this order of magnitude ) . finally , @xmath146 is the fraction of galaxies with a bulge in the @xmath30 m@xmath8 range that host a significant amount of gas ( @xmath147 m@xmath8 ) .",
    "we put @xmath148 , as an upper limit , although this value is uncertain .",
    "@xmath149 is the minor merger fraction in the local universe .",
    "we assume @xmath150 , in agreement with available data and models , although this number is uncertain ( see , e.g. , donghia , mapelli & moore 2008 ; jogee et al . 2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "@xmath151 is the fraction of time that a bh similar to the one powering hlx-1 can spend in mass transfer with a companion star .",
    "there are no estimates of @xmath151 for the case of hlx-1 , and thus we adopt @xmath152 from blecha et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which is the predicted time spent in mass transfer by a @xmath153 m@xmath8 bh hosted in a young star cluster",
    ". the actual value of @xmath151 may be very different from the assumed one , if the companion star is being tidally disrupted by the bh ( l11 ) and/or if the bh is in a different environment from a young star cluster .",
    "@xmath154 is the duty cycle , i.e. the fraction of time that the bh spends in a hlx state ( i.e. , x - ray luminosity -assumed isotropic- higher than @xmath155 erg s@xmath5 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath156 as , since its first detection , hlx-1 was observed above @xmath155 erg s@xmath5 for @xmath157 days during its @xmath26 day semi - regular period ( godet et al .",
    "2009 ; servillat et al .",
    "however , @xmath154 is very uncertain , as we do not know the actual mechanism that powers hlx-1 and the light curve of hlx-1 covers only two periods , which are not particularly regular .    therefore , the expected number density of hlx - like sources is @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the average mass of bulges in the @xmath30 m@xmath8 range , according to the schechter formalism ( li & white 2009 ) .",
    "this estimate suggests that there are @xmath160 hlx - like sources in a sphere with a 100-mpc radius . since we now observe one hlx-1 , either we are missing a fraction of hlx - like systems , or ( more likely ) we are overestimating some of the parameters in equation  ( [ eq : eq1 ] )",
    ". likely , hlx - like sources have a duty cycle @xmath161 ( e.g. , because other sources are in a different accretion regime with respect to hlx-1 ) and/or @xmath162 .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath163 or that @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , we can take our result as an upper limit , to be refined through new data .",
    "hlx-1 , hosted in the s0 galaxy eso 249 - 43 , is the brightest ulx known so far and the strongest imbh candidate ( f09 ) .",
    "the optical counterpart of hlx-1 is a massive compact star cluster ( @xmath165 m@xmath8 , s10 ; f12 ; s12 ) , whose age is uncertain : _ hst _ observations ( f12 ) are consistent with both a very young ( @xmath166 myr ) and a very old ( @xmath167 gyr ) massive star cluster . while the optical and uv variability of the counterpart seems to exclude a young star cluster with a mass higher than @xmath168 m@xmath8 ( s12 ) , theoretical models suggest that the companion of the bh in hlx-1 can not be too old , challenging even the old - cluster scenario ( l11 ) . however , we note that the available constraints on the mass of the donor strongly depend on a number of theoretical assumptions and that alternative accretion mechanisms still need to be investigated ( e.g. , instabilities in a radiation - pressure dominated disc , l11 ) .    in this paper , we studied , through @xmath0body / sph simulations , the scenario where the s0 galaxy eso  243 - 49 is undergoing ( or just underwent ) a minor merger with a gas - rich low - mass disc galaxy .",
    "the simulations show that the observed uv emission and the corresponding sfr ( @xmath15 m@xmath8 yr@xmath5 ) in the bulge of eso 243 - 49 can be explained as a consequence of the interaction . from the comparison between the observed sfr in the bulge of eso 243 - 49 and the simulated sf history , we suggest that , if the uv emission from the optical counterpart of hlx-1 is mostly / entirely due to the reprocessing of the accretion disc , the eso  243 - 49 system is currently at a stage after the second pericentre passage of the companion galaxy . in alternative",
    ", if part of the uv emission from the optical counterpart of hlx-1 is caused by a recent sf episode , the eso 243 - 49 system might be in between the first and the second pericentre passage of the companion galaxy .",
    "we propose that the counterpart of hlx-1 coincides with the nc of the disrupting secondary galaxy .",
    "recent studies ( graham & spitler 2009 ; graham 2012a ) indicate that low - mass galaxies with a @xmath30 m@xmath16 stellar bulge can host both a nc and a @xmath134 m@xmath16 imbh .",
    "the nc scenario explains many properties of hlx-1 : ncs are often composed by multiple stellar populations , mostly old stars with a younger population superimposed . under this hypothesis ,",
    "the counterpart of hlx-1 consists mainly of very old ( @xmath167 gyr ) stars , but the stellar companion of the imbh can be a younger star .",
    "this satisfies the requirement that the mass of the companion star of the imbh be not too small ( @xmath28 m@xmath8 ) to reproduce the observed x - ray luminosity and variability ( see l11 ) . to further check our scenario , we need new uv observations and a simultaneous monitoring of the x - ray and uv emission , to understand whether the uv emission from the hlx-1 counterpart is entirely due to disc reprocessing or is partially connected with a young stellar population .",
    "we compare the extrapolated luminosity of the simulated secondary galaxy with the observed magnitude of the hlx-1 counterpart ( from the vlt observations reported by s12 ) .",
    "we find that a very late merger stage ( @xmath169 gyr from the first pericentre passage ) , or a relatively bound orbit ( eccentricity @xmath170 ) , or a primary - to - secondary galaxy mass fraction @xmath171 are required to be consistent with the observed @xmath104 magnitude of the hlx-1 counterpart . on the other hand ,",
    "this constraint comes from many assumptions about the mass - to - light conversion in our simulations and may be affected by their spatial resolution . in a forthcoming paper , we will make a more accurate comparison with the observed photometry , by considering a wider grid of simulations ( including a few higher resolution runs ) .",
    "if our scenario is correct , we expect the density of hlx - like sources to be @xmath1 sources mpc@xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath160 sources in a sphere of 100-mpc radius .    from our simulations , we find that the three - dimensional distance of hlx-1 from eso 243 - 49 might be much larger ( even by a factor of @xmath172 ) than the observed projected distance , if the merger is still ongoing .",
    "in fact , the existing spectroscopic measurements do not exclude a shift by @xmath173 km s@xmath5 , along the line of sight , between eso 243 - 49 and the hlx-1 counterpart . therefore , new spectroscopic measurements are required , to establish with better accuracy the relative velocity between eso 243 - 49 and the hlx-1 counterpart , and to improve the constraints on the kinematics of the merger . in addition , there might be a number of x - ray sources analogous to hlx-1 that have been missed or mis - classified because they are ( in projection ) farther out from the host galaxy .",
    "therefore , it will be crucial to search for sources analogues to hlx-1 , to test our and other possible scenarios .",

    "<S> the point - like x - ray source hlx-1 is the brightest known ultraluminous x - ray source and likely the strongest intermediate - mass black hole candidate . </S>",
    "<S> hlx-1 is hosted in the s0 galaxy eso 243 - 49 , but offset with respect to the nucleus , and its optical counterpart was identified with a massive star cluster . in this paper , we study , through @xmath0body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations , the scenario where eso 243 - 49 is undergoing ( or just underwent ) a minor merger with a gas - rich low - mass late - type galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations suggest that the observed star formation rate ( sfr ) in eso 243 - 49 is a consequence of the interaction and that the companion galaxy already underwent the second pericentre passage . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the counterpart of hlx-1 coincides with the nucleus ( and possibly with the nuclear star cluster ) of the secondary galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that , if the minor merger scenario is correct , the number density of x - ray sources similar to hlx-1 is @xmath1 mpc@xmath2 .    </S>",
