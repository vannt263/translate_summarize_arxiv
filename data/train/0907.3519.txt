    "the ` mexican hat ' potential allows for a simple and intuitive description of the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",

    "( 3 pions in the case @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of light quark flavors ) emerge as ( quasi ) pseudoscalar goldstone bosons as a consequence of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry : @xmath4 in the context of a linear @xmath0-model this spontaneous breaking is induced by a negative squared mass of the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "this feature is responsible for the typical mexican hat form of the mesonic potential .    in this work , beyond the ground state ( pseudo)scalar mesons",
    ", we also consider the first excited ( pseudo)scalar states and we investigate the case in which also in this sector a negative squared mass is present .",
    "as we shall argue , for some parameter choice this possibility can not be excluded and leads to a more complicated scenario , in which ground - state and first - excited scalar and pseudoscalar mesons mix . moreover , for some parameter choice it is possible that also one neutral pseudoscalar pionic field condenses , thus realizing a spontaneous symmetry breaking of parity .",
    "the paper is organized as it follows : we first briefly review the properties of the mexican hat potential and its emergence from an hadronic model of qcd .",
    "we then turn to the case of two linked mexican hats and discuss the consequences of this assumptions .",
    "first , the parameter range in which only spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry take place is studied .",
    "then , the parameter range in which also spontaneous breaking of parity occurs is investigated . in the end , the conclusions are briefly outlined .",
    "in its simplest form the mexican hat potential is written in terms of two real scalar fields @xmath0 and @xmath5 : @xmath6{c}% , \\end{array } \\label{sigma}%\\ ] ] where in the last passage the complex scalar field @xmath7 has been introduced .",
    "the requirement @xmath8 ensures that the potential is bounded from below .",
    "let us assume that -as in qcd , see below- @xmath0 represents a scalar field ( @xmath9 under parity transformation @xmath10 ) while @xmath5 represents a pseudoscalar field ( @xmath11 under @xmath10 ) .",
    "note , the quadratic ( mass ) term of the mexican hat potential reads @xmath12 i.e. it has a negative coefficient as long as @xmath13 is a real number , which corresponds to an imaginary mass for both the @xmath0 and the @xmath5 fields .",
    "for this reason one can immediately deduce that the point @xmath14 does not correspond to the minimum of the potential .",
    "moreover , an expansion around this point is instable .",
    "the potential @xmath15 is symmetric under @xmath16 ( denoted as chiral ) transformation , namely : @xmath17{c}%",

    ". if no other information is given , each one of these minima can be in principle realized .",
    "however , we assume that a small perturbation , which breaks chiral symmetry but does not break parity , @xmath20 with @xmath21 , takes place : as a consequence , the only realized minimum is @xmath22 [ a change of sign of @xmath23 would simply provide the equivalent solution @xmath24 . when evaluating the fluctuations around the minimum @xmath25 , one obtains a scalar , massive @xmath0 meson with @xmath26 and a pseudoscalar , massless goldstone boson @xmath5 .",
    "the chiral symmetry of the model is not realized as a degeneracy of the particle spectrum because the minimum ( i.e. the vacuum ) is not left invariant by this transformation : spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry has taken place and the field @xmath5 is the corresponding goldstone boson .",
    "for the purpose of this paper we briefly recall how the mexican hat potential describes the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry which is observed in the context of low - energy qcd .",

    "the latter is a necessary condition for spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the anomalous term @xmath70 breaks explicitly chiral symmetry and can not be regarded as a small perturbation .",

    "@xmath195 is that the states of opposite parity @xmath135 and @xmath138 mix , thus originating two massive physical states @xmath232 and @xmath233 which are not eigenstates of parity . at the same time also the states of opposite parity @xmath136 and @xmath137 mix , out of which one massless and one massive bosons @xmath234 and @xmath235 -both with undefined parity- are obtained .",
    "numerically , one has a mirror - like picture for @xmath155 with respect to the parity conserving case , as depicted in fig .",
    "1 , right panel .    obviously , the here outlined scenario for @xmath155 can not describe qcd , where parity is conserved in the vacuum .",
    "the vafa - witten theorem @xcite states that spontaneous parity violation does not occur in theories containing vector - like fermions .",
    "thus , if this theorem holds , the model of eq .",

    "however , the validity of the vafa - witten theorem has been questioned in a variety of works ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . if it is not valid , it is still conceivable that for a different value of @xmath224 , spontaneous breaking of parity takes place in the vacuum : in this case the here outlined model -with real @xmath131 and negative @xmath134- would correspond to its low - energy hadronic ( confined ) realization .",
    "more in general , the original constrain that the charged components of the pion field can also be released .",
    "all the present treatment is still valid upon replacing @xmath138 with @xmath236 we have in this case the condition @xmath237 : as soon as also @xmath238 and/or @xmath239 not only parity , but also charge conjugation is spontaneously broken .",
    "however , it is enough that a further , small perturbation , which originates from other interactions and is invariant under change conjugation , is present : then this additional perturbation generates a condensation of @xmath240 only , in line with the discussion of the present paper .",
    "the main interest of this paper has been the possibility that an hadronic , @xmath0-model for qcd is effectively described by a ` double ' mexican hat effective potential . in this scenario not only in the subspace of the neutral ground state ( pseudo)scalar mesons @xmath223 and @xmath241 fields , but also in the subspace of the first excited ( pseudo)scalar mesons @xmath242 and @xmath243 fields ,",
    "a typical mexican hat form is present .",
    "mixing among these bare configurations arise : in the case that no spontaneous parity breaking occurs ( here for @xmath244 the outlined effective model is in agreement with all the constraints imposed by qcd . in the case",
    "that parity symmetry breaking occurs @xmath245 the described model can provide an effective description of a underlying qcd - like theory only if the vafa - witten theorem does not strictly hold .",
    "more in general , the here presented model can also be conceived as an ` elementary ' model of ( pseudo)scalar fields which generates parity breaking for some choices of the parameters and may play a role in the early universe .          in the @xmath2 case",
    "one can consider the reduced combination@xmath246 @xmath247 which also transforms as @xmath248 under chiral @xmath249 transformation ( but not under @xmath250 : the axial transformation , which mixes @xmath0 with @xmath81 and @xmath251 with @xmath93 can not be described with @xmath252 only ) .",
    "the contributions of the @xmath253 and @xmath254 terms are equal in this case and the corresponding potential can be written as @xmath255 -f^{2}\\right )   ^{2}=\\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\left (   \\sigma^{2}+\\overrightarrow{\\pi } ^{2}-f^{2}\\right )   ^{2}.$ ] clearly , the model of eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) is recovered by setting @xmath256      the anomaly term proportional to @xmath60 is in the present form not renormalizable for @xmath257 although this is already in the region of heavy quarks and therefore unimportant for practical purposes , the general issue is if non - renormalizable terms should enter in an effective description of qcd . in principle , being an effective qcd model valid in a restricted low - energy domain , there is no reason to disregard non - renormalizable terms . for instance , nambu jona - lasinio inspired models of qcd are non - renormalizable . as another example , one can consider the non - renormalizable fermi lagrangian of weak interactions , which arises as a low - energy effective term of the more complete ( and renormalizable ) electroweak lagrangian . on the other hand ,",
    "what can constrain the dimensionality of terms entering in an hadronic lagrangian is -rather than the renormalizability- the requirement that dilatation invariance is solely broken by a yang - mills scale in the glueball sector , see details in ref .",
