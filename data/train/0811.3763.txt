    "a hole propagates coherently in the valence band of a band insulator with an unrenormalized one - particle dispersion ( i.e. , determined by electronic structure calculations ) , whereas hole propagation in a mott insulator is a nontrivial many - body problem .",
    "the paradigm here is a hole doped in the half filled one - band hubbard model that is a minimal model used to describe the parent compounds of high-@xmath4 superconductors .",
    "such a hole forms a defect in the antiferromagnetic ( af ) background , and its coherent propagation may appear then only on a strongly renormalized energy scale.@xcite naively , i.e. , considering the nel state induced by ising - like spin interactions , one expects that a propagating hole would disturb the af background and generate a string of broken bonds , with ever increasing energy cost when the hole creates defects moving away from its initial position .",
    "this suggests hole confinement as realized already four decades ago.@xcite nevertheless , the quantum nature of this problem leads to a new quality : a hole in the af mott insulator can propagate coherently on the energy scale @xmath1 which controls af quantum fluctuations , @xcite because they heal the defects arising on the hole path .",
    "crucial for this observation is the presence of transverse spin components @xmath5 , responsible for quantum fluctuations in the su(2)-symmetric heisenberg exchange interactions .",
    "in contrast , the orbital interactions which induce alternating orbital ( ao ) order are known to be more ising - like@xcite ( classical ) and quantum fluctuations are then either substantially reduced,@xcite or even absent .",
    "perhaps the most prominent example of robust orbital order occurs for degenerate @xmath6 orbitals in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) planes of lamno@xmath7.@xcite orbital interactions are there induced both by the lattice ( due to cooperative jahn - teller effect ) and by the superexchange@xcite  both of them are classical and ising - like , so the quantum fluctuations are to a large extent suppressed .",
    "therefore , the orbital order is more robust than the spin order in two - dimensional ( 2d ) models,@xcite and a higher hole concentration is required to destroy it.@xcite in the three - dimensional case off - diagonal ( interorbital ) hopping ( @xmath6 orbital flavor is here not conserved@xcite ) may even lead to an orbital liquid phase already at rather low hole doping.@xcite    another difference to the su(2 ) spin model is that a hole in a ferromagnet with ao order of @xmath6 orbitals can propagate coherently without introducing any string states .",
    "this coherent propagation arises here due to the @xmath6 interorbital hopping , but is strongly renormalized by orbital excitations.@xcite however , in the @xmath3 systems the interorbital hopping is forbidden by symmetry,@xcite and the superexchange is purely ising - like , so the above established mechanisms of coherent hole propagation in the regime of large on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath2 , i.e. , for @xmath8 where @xmath0 is the hopping element , are absent .",
    "one may then wonder whether a hole doped to a mott insulator with the @xmath3 ao order would then be confined.@xcite    the present paper is motivated by the above important difference between the spin physics and the orbital physics , especially prominent in the hole motion in the @xmath3 orbital systems .",
    "@xcite in spin models , the ising - like superexchange represents only a rather poor approximation for the su(2)-symmetric heisenberg spin exchange ( as obtained in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model by its derivation from the hubbard model @xcite ) and could merely serve as a starting point for the full su(2)-symmetric calculations .",
    "@xcite in contrast , in the systems with @xmath3 orbital degeneracy the ising superexchange follows from a similar derivation as an accurate description of charge excitations in the second order of the perturbation theory in the regime of @xmath8 , in cases when only two orbitals are active ( see below ) . strictly speaking",
    ", in these realistic orbital systems the ising - like superexchange occurs in a two - band model when precisely one orbital flavor permits the hopping along each bond , as only then the orbital flavor can not be exchanged and the pseudospin @xmath9 operators are absent in the respective @xmath0@xmath1 model.@xcite such a situation is found not only in the above mentioned @xmath3 model but also in three other distinct orbital models ( see below ) .",
    "hence , in the following paragraphs we give a brief overview of these _ four models with realistic ising superexchange _ for which the spectral function of a single hole doped into the half - filled ground state will be studied in this paper .    as a first example we introduce the spinless falicov - kimball ( fk ) model which describes itinerant @xmath10 electrons coupled to localized @xmath11 electrons . on sites occupied by an @xmath11 electron ,",
    "the @xmath10 electrons feel a strong on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath2 .",
    "the fk model can be solved exactly in infinite dimension,@xcite where it leads to a complex phase diagram including periodic ground states as well as a regime of phase separation .",
    "when the energies of two involved orbitals are degenerate ( which is not the case in @xmath12 or @xmath13 materials ) , one finds that electron densities in the two orbitals are the same ( @xmath14 ) , and second order perturbation theory leads in the regime of large @xmath2 to a strong - coupling model with one mobile flavor .",
    "one finds therefore the ground state with the ao order formed by sites occupied by @xmath10 and @xmath11 electrons on the two sublattices .",
    "the spectral density for the mobile @xmath10 electrons can be obtained as well in one  @xcite and two dimensions,@xcite but computation of the @xmath11 spectral density is quite involved even at infinite dimension .",
    "@xcite below we will discuss exact one - dimensional ( 1d ) and approximate two - dimensional ( 2d ) analytic results for the relevant fk models .    a second and different realization of the effective low - energy model with ising superexchange was proposed recently@xcite for fm planes in transition metal oxides with @xmath3 orbital degeneracy : in this case , both orbital flavors are equivalent ( the third one is inactive ) and both allow for electronic hopping , however , each one permits the hopping along one axis only . despite the 1d character of the kinetic energy in such a model",
    ", the ground state at half filling has 2d ao order , stabilized by the ising superexchange .",
    "electron propagation , on the other hand , is strictly 1d , so a hole replacing an electron with either orbital flavor may only move in one direction by the hopping @xmath0 .",
    "such a situation might be realized in sr@xmath15vo@xmath16 , where the crystal field splits the @xmath3 orbitals @xcite and one finds indeed ao order@xcite in the weakly fm planes .",
    "@xcite a different possible realization of such a model is found in cold - atom systems,@xcite with strongly anisotropic hopping in the spinless @xmath17-orbital hubbard model.@xcite    the third realization concerns systems with peculiar @xmath6 ao and is somewhat subtle . as described above in the `` well - known '' systems with active @xmath6 orbitals ( such as the perovskite manganites ) the hole can propagate coherently due to the interorbital hopping.@xcite however , one can identify two peculiar cases of @xmath6 ao order where the interorbital hopping is strongly reduced between the orbitals occupied in the ground state , and the question of the hole confinement in the ising superexchange model is of high relevance .",
    "the first one is realized in the fm planes of k@xmath15cuf@xmath16,@xcite or in the recently investigated cs@xmath15agf@xmath16.@xcite while the ao order is formed in these cases by @xmath6 orbitals , crystal field stabilizes their particular linear combinations with alternating @xmath18 @xmath6 orbitals,@xcite and thus suppresses the interorbital hopping present , for instance , in the ground state of the manganites .",
    "in addition , the phase factors of two orbitals along each bond allow for the hopping only along one direction in the plane , @xcite so one arrives at a situation similar to that found for strongly correlated electrons in @xmath3 orbitals  it will be discussed in the appendix [ app : fluo ] .",
    "thus , the model called @xmath3 model throughout this paper is expected to describe a wider class of transition metal oxides .",
    "finally , another case where the ao order could in principle lead to the hole confinement is the situation encountered in the 1d @xmath6 model in which the interorbital hopping and quantum fluctuations are suppressed by symmetry .",
    "since this model is actually equivalent to the 1d fk model discussed above , we will refer to it later simply as to the `` 1d model '' .",
    "its study was stimulated by the experimental findings in the lightly hole - doped vanadates such as la@xmath19sr@xmath20vo@xmath7.@xcite there the ground state for @xmath21 is an insulating three - dimensional fm phase with ao order at @xmath22 .",
    "the physical origin of the mott insulating state in the case of such a finite hole doping is not yet understood .",
    "again , a natural question could be whether the peculiar stability of the mott insulating state is related to the presence of the ao order .",
    "since it is obvious that the hole can move in the ao state in the plane ( due to the interorbital hopping , see above ) it is interesting to verify whether the ao order along the third direction could block the hole motion .",
    "the four above cases are , to our knowledge , the only straightforward models in which the full superexchange is purely classical , i.e. , where ising superexchange follows from the orbital symmetry , and is not an approximation to the heisenberg hamiltonian.@xcite the superexchange models , however , have to be extended by the second order three - site hopping terms in each case .",
    "such effective hopping terms arise in the same order of the perturbation theory when holes are present , and are necessary for a faithful representation of the spectral weight distribution in the one - particle and in the optical spectra of the underlying spin hubbard model.@xcite therefore , also in the present orbital @xmath0-@xmath1 models with ising superexchange similar terms are expected to play an important role and can not be neglected . moreover , while in the spin case such terms are in conflict with the quantum fluctuations and give thus only minor quantitative corrections to the coherent hole motion , @xcite in the orbital ( pseudospin ) models with ising superexchange they become of crucial importance as they are the only possible source for coherent carrier propagation ( the trugman loops@xcite with the hole repairing the defects on its path are here absent ) and dictate possible coherent processes.@xcite to get a better understanding of the balance between the coherent and incoherent processes in the orbital strong - coupling models ( i.e. @xmath0-@xmath1 models with three - site terms ) we analyze their spectral properties in some detail below .    in order to arrive at a comprehensive and rather complete understanding of the elemental processes which accompany hole propagation in the orbital models ,",
    "we not only combine numerical and analytical approaches but also we calculate the spectral properties both of the strong - coupling and of the respective hubbard models . hence , we first determine the green s functions using the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) and the analytical treatments applied to the above mentioned orbital strong - coupling models .",
    "this allows us to identify the dominant mechanism responsible for the quasiparticle ( qp ) behavior .",
    "we note that for finite doping such methods as the slave boson approach , the path integral formalism , or the numerical approaches , are much more suitable for the @xmath0-@xmath1-like models than the scba.@xcite however , in the one hole limit the scba gives reasonably good results which are in agreement with other methods.@xcite .",
    "we then compare these results to those obtained for the respective orbital hubbard model . here , in some cases we determine green s functions numerically by use of exact diagonalization on small clusters , in others we use the variational cluster approach ( vca),@xcite where a cluster is solved exactly and then embedded into a larger system .",
    "this variational approach is based on cluster perturbation theory developed in the last decade,@xcite and corresponds to taking the self - energy from a small cluster and optimizing it with respect to mean - field terms arising due to the ao order .",
    "the embedding via the self - energy approach@xcite allows us to include long - range ( orbital ) ordering phenomena by optimizing a fictitious field due to the ao order .",
    "this method is appropriate for orbital hubbard models with on - site interactions .",
    "since the exact solution on the cluster is obtained for the full hamiltonian , it contains all potentially relevant processes like , e.g. , the three - site hopping .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ sec:1dmodel ] whereas its extension to the 2d fk model is discussed in sec .",

    "the analysis is supplemented by the appendix [ app : fluo ] , where we derive the effective strong - coupling model for the above mentioned fluorides and prove that the @xmath3 model discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : t2 g ] may indeed be applied to the hole motion in the systems with a particular type of @xmath6 orbital order .",
    "as explained in sec . [ sec : intro ] , the ising - like superexchange follows if only one orbital flavor permits hopping along each bond , and the spins are polarized in the fm state . the simplest case which captures the essential features of the effective strong - coupling model with ising - like superexchange follows from the 1d orbital hubbard model @xmath23 where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) creates a spinless electron with orbital flavor @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) at site @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are electron density operators .",

    ". only electrons with orbital flavor @xmath26 are mobile while the other ones with flavor @xmath27 can not hop . to simplify",
    ", we call below the @xmath26 and @xmath27 orbitals mobile and immobile ones , respectively",
    ". this situation corresponds to ( spinless ) interacting @xmath6 electrons in the fm chain , @xcite or to the 1d ( spinless ) fk model with degenerate orbitals .    in the regime of large @xmath2 ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath8 , second order perturbation theory leads to the effective strong - coupling hamiltonian with ising - like superexchange @xmath30 where @xmath31 here a tilde above a fermion operator indicates that the hilbert space is restricted to unoccupied and singly occupied sites , e.g. @xmath32 .",
    "the pseudospin operators are defined as follows @xmath33 and the superexchange constant @xmath1 and the effective hopping parameter @xmath34 are given by @xmath35 we introduced above the parameter @xmath34 in order to distinguish below between the terms which originate from the pseudospin superexchange and the hopping processes arising from the superexchange via the three - site terms that lead to the second or third neighbor effective hopping and contribute to the hole dispersion in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "note that @xmath34 is of the same order @xmath36 as @xmath1 , so _ a priori _ these terms can not be neglected .",
    "but similar as for the constrained hopping term ( [ hj_eg ] ) , their contribution is proportional to hole doping @xmath37 .",
    "the 1d @xmath0-@xmath1 orbital model @xmath38 , i.e. without the three - site hopping @xmath39 , was solved exactly before@xcite and all excitations occurred to be dispersionless .",
    "here we generalize this exact solution to the full strong - coupling hamiltonian ( [ h_1d ] ) _ including _ the three - site terms , and show that the spectral functions for both orbital flavors are then distinctly different .",
    "we calculate below the _ exact _ green s functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 which demonstrate whether and how a hole added to an @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 ) orbital may propagate coherently along a 1d chain with the ao order .",
    "interestingly , both functions can be determined _ analytically _ using retraceable path approximation @xcite ( rpa ) , which becomes here exact because closed loops are absent in the 1d system.@xcite    an important simplification as compared with the spin case is the knowledge of the exact ground state @xmath42 at half filling . as the hamiltonian given by eq .",

    "the lack of the qp dispersion in one direction , e.g. along the @xmath26 direction for a hole doped into the @xmath26 orbital , is at first instance counterintuitive : one could imagine that it should be allowed that the hole doped into the @xmath26 orbital switches to a neighboring site of the @xmath44 sublattice by the @xmath0 process , and then propagates freely along the @xmath26 axis by the three - site effective hopping @xmath34 without generating any further defects .",

    "@xcite this means that the zig - zag - like hole trapping in the orbital case is physically similar to the standard hole trapping in the spin case ( apart from the modified energy scale due to a different value of the superexchange , the ladder spectra are similar in both cases ) , whereas for the free hole movement obviously it matters whether the dispersion relation is 1d or 2d .",
    "moreover , this also means that in this special case ( @xmath92 ) the spectra are the same for holes doped into either of the orbitals as the green s functions are the same for both sublattices .",
    "however , even in this case it is not allowed to assume _ a priori _ that @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "in fact , these are two sublattices with two distinct orbital states occupied in the ground state at half filling , and each orbital has entirely different hopping geometry .",

    "[ fig : three_site_t2g](d)(f ) , involves an orbital flip at the intermediate site , destroys the ao order on six neighboring bonds , and thus costs additional energy . as two orbitals are flipped and two excited states are generated , these processes go beyond the lowest order perturbation theory , and it is consistent to neglect them in the scba . in any case , they could contribute only to the incoherent processes at high energy and not to the low - energy qp .",
    "indeed , this interpretation was confirmed by exact diagonalization performed for the strong - coupling hamiltonian ( [ t2gmodel ] ) on @xmath197 and @xmath198 clusters , which gave the same results for the qp dispersion , no matter whether the orbital - flipping terms ( [ h3s1 ] ) were included or not .",

    "indeed , the collapse of the qp bandwidth in the regime of @xmath148 may be understood as following from numerous incoherent string excitations which are easy in this regime as they do not cost much energy .",

    "these hopping elements were neglected in both the hubbard model ( [ ht2 g ] ) and in the strong - coupling model ( [ t2gmodel ] ) , but they could significantly influence the spectral weight distribution .",

    "the same requirements for orbital symmetry that are necessary to obtain nn hopping , as discussed in this work , also strongly restrict the range of allowed longer - range hopping terms .",
    "it is important to recall that the @xmath10@xmath10 hopping elements involve intermediate oxygen orbitals . for next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) hopping , the orbital phases of the involved oxygen @xmath297 orbitals make all terms vanish that conserve orbital flavor,@xcite and only orbital - flipping terms , @xmath298 given by hopping element @xmath299 , are finite . with realistic parameters , we arrived at the estimation of @xmath300 mev , i.e. , @xmath301 .",

    "note that the value of @xmath308 is here larger than expected in transition metal oxides , where it is in general smaller than the three - site hopping term @xmath113 .",

    "[ fig : spec_t_prime ]    from the above example we have seen that the longer - range hopping violates the particle - hole symmetry of the spectral functions .",

    "[ fig : spec_t_prime ] . as a result ,",
    "the spectra exhibit a striking _ particle - hole asymmetry _  reduced dispersion in the particle ( inverse photoemission ) sector corresponds to enhanced dispersion in the hole ( photoemission ) sector and _ vice versa_.    we will show now that the above asymmetry follows indeed from the difference between the nn and nnn hopping under particle - hole transformation . while this is transparent for the hubbard model acting in the full hilbert space , it is somewhat subtle for the @xmath0@xmath1-like models .",
    "thereby we focus on the @xmath304 hopping which influences directly the qp dispersion .",
    "the operator for nn hopping can be transformed from @xmath311 electron operators to @xmath312 hole operators , and one arrives at an identical form for the kinetic energy , as long as a phase shift between the two sublattices is introduced : @xmath313 where @xmath314 is the lattice site .",
    "hopping along the @xmath26 axis then becomes @xmath315 and analogously along the @xmath27 axis .",
    "the minus sign for one of the sublattices corresponds to a momentum shift by @xmath316 , as can be easily verified in the fourier transform . @xmath317",
    "the on - site density - density interaction is not affected by the particle - hole transformation , apart from a shift in the chemical potential .",
    "since the three - site hopping emerges from the hubbard - like model with nn hopping , it respects particle - hole symmetry .",
    "hence it obeys the same rules concerning particle - hole transformation , i.e. , momentum @xmath258 for electrons is mapped to @xmath257 for holes . for the third - neighbor hopping @xmath304 ( [ htp ] ) , however , the above transformation does not longer work , because both the creation and the annihilation operator act on the same sublattice .",
    "instead the transformation vector would have to be @xmath318 .",
    "consequently , the combined effect of explicit nnn hopping and three - site terms stemming from nn processes turns out to be strongly particle - hole asymmetric .",
    "for example , negative @xmath304 gives a band in the electron sector with the largest distance from the fermi energy at momenta @xmath258 and @xmath257 , and the values nearest to it at @xmath319 , and the same is true for the three - site hopping .",
    "consequently , the two dispersions add together and lead to increased total dispersion , see the photoemission part in fig .  [",
    "fig : spec_t_prime_minus ] . on the contrary , in inverse",
    "photoemission the direct nnn hopping @xmath304 gives a maximal distance at @xmath319 , while maximal energy is still found at @xmath258 and @xmath257 for the three - site terms .",
    "therefore , now @xmath304 and three - site hopping @xmath34 compete with each other , and the dispersion is weaker . for a particular choice of the model parameters they can even cancel each other , as shown in the inverse photoemission part in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_t_prime_minus ] .",
    "positive @xmath304 leads to the opposite result , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_t_prime_plus ] .",
    "thus , even large and unphysical values of @xmath304 not only do not destroy the qualitative spectra predicted in the previous sections but result in asymmetry between the photoemission and inverse photoemission part of the spectra , so their contribution can easily be resolved .",

    "( [ t2gmodel ] ) describes also this case , as we show by a detailed derivation in the appendix .",
    "hence , we conclude that the photoemission and inverse photoemission spectra for the planar vanadium oxide sr@xmath15vo@xmath16 and for the planar k@xmath15cuf@xmath16 or cs@xmath15agf@xmath16 fluorides should be qualitatively similar to the spectral functions shown in figs . [",

    "in this paper we analyzed only the orbital sector of the superexchange , which decides about the hole dynamics when spins are polarized in the fm ground state .",
    "we discussed all possible situations ( see below ) where the orbital symmetry leads to the purely ising superexchange in one and two dimensions .",
    "exceptions from this rule are numerous systems with @xmath6 orbital degrees of freedom,@xcite or fm chains with two active orbitals,@xcite but we also provided examples of @xmath6 systems with ising superexchange .",
    "the 1d hubbard - like model with two orbital flavors , but only one of them participating in nn hopping , served to explain the general principles and consequences of the ising - like superexchange .",
    "besides , this model stands for several physically relevant situations , including electrons moving within either @xmath6 or @xmath3 orbitals in one dimension , and the 1d fk model .",
    "we have shown that , particularly in all these cases , the relevant strong - coupling model has to include the three - site effective hopping .",
    "when both interorbital hopping and orbital - flip processes in the superexchange are absent , the three - site hopping term which arises from superexchange is crucial and is the only source of coherent hole propagation .",
    "we have shown that the 2d fk model with one immobile ( @xmath11 ) and one mobile ( @xmath10 ) orbital has many common features with the 1d model . in both cases",
    "one finds only one dispersive mode for a hole inserted into the mobile orbital , and two non - dispersive modes for a hole doped in the immobile orbital .",
    "this latter hole excitation creates a trapped polaron , with the hole confined within a cluster consisting of a central site and its nearest neighbors ( i.e. , three sites in the 1d model , and five sites in the 2d model ) .",
    "while the hole can in principle escape from the polaron via three - site hopping process , we have shown that such processes have only very low spectral weight in the realistic regime of parameters , and thus the hole remains _ de facto _ trapped inside the polaron .",
    "in contrast to this almost perfectly localized hole , a hole in the mobile orbital propagates freely , and its dispersion which originates from the three - site hopping is unrenormalized . therefore ,",
    "the two inequivalent orbital flavors behave in the fk models in a radically different way , and decouple from each other ( interacting only by the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath2 , which stabilizes the ao ground state ) .",
    "the model relevant for the 2d orbital physics in transition metal oxides leads , however , to qualitatively different results .",
    "in the 2d @xmath3 orbital model , which is also applicable to the ao state formed by @xmath6 orbitals in fluorides ( see the appendix ) , electrons do not separate into those confined to either sublattice ( occupied by orbitals of particular symmetry in the ground state with ao order ) , but may delocalize over the lattice and thereby undergo incoherent scattering on the orbital excitations , which strongly renormalizes and reduces the dispersion of the qp states .",
    "these qp states arise at half filling in the regime of large coulomb interaction @xmath2 , when a hole ( electon ) is added to the ground state with ao order . while electron hopping is of the purely 1d character , it selects by symmetry possible three - site processes , which are responsible for the qp dispersion .",
    "therefore , the dispersion of the qp state depends on the considered orbital and is again 1d , with a hole propagating coherently along the two crystal axes for the two orbitals .",
    "we emphasize that the mechanism of coherent hole propagation which occurs in the 2d @xmath3 orbital model is completely different from the one known in the spin case . in orbital systems",
    "( with conserved orbital flavors ) it originates entirely from the three - site hopping processes , similar to hole propagation in the 1d or 2d fk model .",
    "but unlike in the latter models , in the 2d @xmath3 case the qp bandwidth is strongly reduced from the value given by the amplitude of bare three - site hopping .",
    "we have explained this renormalization as following from incoherent string excitations which dress the coherent propagation and do not contribute additional momentum dependence . as a special case ,",
    "we have discussed the subtle interplay between the coherent hole propagation and string excitations in the 1d centipede model , where polaronic hole confinement competes with coherent propagation along the chain , and which to some extent resembles the realistic 2d @xmath3 case .",
    "we discussed the impact of realistic longer - range hopping terms ( as expected in real materials such as vanadates or fluorides ) , and found that the second neighbor terms are frustrated in the ground state with ao order ",
    "these processes would flip the orbital flavor , and are therefore suppressed at low energy , not affecting the qp dispersion .",
    "in contrast , third - neighbor hopping processes conserve orbital flavor and lead to a pronounced particle - hole asymmetry in the spectral weight distribution . in both cases ,",
    "the 1d character of hole propagation which follows from the symmetry of involved orbitals , survives and determines the character of the spectral density at low energy .    in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated that orbital models with ising superexchange describe a broad class of interesting phenomena .",
    "spectral features resulting from such models exhibit weak momentum dependence and are fundamentally different from those known from the the spin case with the su(2)-symmetric superexchange .",
