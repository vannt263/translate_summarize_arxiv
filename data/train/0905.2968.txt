    "the grb luminosity function  plays a central role in the interpretation of the observed source counts and redshift distributions of grbs detected with different instruments in different energy bands and to different detection limits .",
    "of particular interest are the resulting rates and the variation with redshift , since these must reflect the properties of the grb progenitors .",
    "ideally , the luminosity function  is derived from a well defined flux - limited sample of grbs with redshifts . for most grb surveys ,",
    "it is not possible to collect such a sample with well defined gamma - ray and optical flux limits .",
    "we will discuss the situation for the _ swift _   mission in section 4 .    in the absence of usable redshift statistics ,",
    "most studies of the luminosity function  use luminosity criteria , such as variability @xcite and spectral lag @xcite .",
    "we have reviewed several luminosity functions resulting from these studies and found that they generally are not compatible with the source counts and the value of @xmath1  for grbs in the batse catalog @xcite .",
    "as long as this is the case , they can not provide reliable predictions about redshift distributions , etc .",
    "the correlation between the rest frame spectral peak energy @xmath6and the isotropic - equivalent radiated energy @xmath7 found by @xcite seemed to be very promising as a luminosity indicator .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that for a large fraction of batse bursts there is no redshift that satisfies the amati relation ; for further discussion also see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite , a redshift degeneracy in the amati relation makes it impossible to derive redshifts larger than 0.9 with usable accuracy .",
    "using durations and spectral parameters for grbs detected by _ swift _",
    "@xcite find a @xmath8  correlation that is inconsistent with the amati relation at @xmath9 significance , with double the scatter .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite discussed the effect of detector thresholds on the derivation of @xmath8   correlations .",
    "the latter authors argue that all pre-_swift _",
    "@xmath8correlations are likely unrelated to the physical properties of grbs .    in a study of the grb luminosity function from 82 hete-2 grbs @xcite ,",
    "an amati - type correlation was used to derive pseudo - redshifts for the 62 grbs lacking an observed redshift .",
    "this study provides information about low - luminosity grbs and x - ray flashes that are not represented in the batse based gusbad catalog .    in the present study",
    ", we introduce a new correlation between the peak spectral energy of the observed peak flux @xmath0  and the euclidean value of @xmath1 .",
    "the correlation was discovered for grbs in the gusbad catalog .",
    "since the euclidean value of @xmath1  is a geometric cosmological distance indicator @xcite , the peak luminosity of a subgroup of grbs with given @xmath0  can be derived without knowing any redshifts .",
    "using the @xmath3  correlation is not subject to any of the problems mentioned above for the amati relation .",
    "the approach in our paper is the following .",
    "we use gusbad fluxes in the four batse discla channels to divide them into five spectral classes based on their @xmath0  values .",
    "we assume that the luminosity function  of each spectral group is a gaussian of @xmath10 with a value of @xmath11  large enough so that the overall sum of the five luminosity functions is reasonably smooth .",
    "in addition , we assume that the overall rate density of grbs varies with redshift as @xmath2 .",
    "the central luminosity @xmath12 of each spectral gaussian is derived by a process of iteration , until the corresponding value of @xmath13  for the spectral class agrees with that observed .",
    "the procedure allows deriving the overall grb luminosity function from the gusbad catalog without using any redshifts .",
    "the main free parameter is the rate function @xmath2 . to evaluate the predicted luminosity and redshift distributions for various forms of @xmath2",
    ", we do need a sample with redshifts .",
    "we evaluate and use _ swift _  detected grbs with observed redshifts . for the successful luminosity functions ,",
    "the process yields a rest frame @xmath6  value for each of the spectral classes .",
    "this leads to @xmath4  and @xmath5  correlations entirely based on data in this paper .",
    "the use of @xmath13  and the derivation of @xmath0  from grbs in the gusbad catalog are discussed in section 2 , as well as the evidence for the @xmath3  correlation .",
    "the framework for deriving the luminosity function  is discussed in section 3 . the status and completeness of _ swift _",
    "observations is covered in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we present two luminosity functions with differing redshift dependence @xmath2  and test them on _ swift _  redshift and luminosity distributions .",
    "the @xmath4  and @xmath5  correlations are derived in section 6 .",
    "a discussion and summary follows in section 7 .",
    "the gusbad catalog @xcite is based on observations with the batse lad detectors which provide output in four energy channels , viz .",
    "@xmath14 kev ( ch 1 ) , @xmath15 kev ( ch 2 ) , @xmath16 kev ( ch 3 ) , and @xmath17 kev ( ch 4 ) .",
    "the catalog lists peak photon fluxes for channels 2 and 3 together .",
    "these were derived assuming a band spectrum @xcite with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 kev . for the present study ,",
    "we have derived for each grb peak photon fluxes in each channel based on the two brightest illuminated lad detectors .    at the outset of this study , it was not clear whether the four channels of the batse lad detectors could be used for low - resolution spectrophotometry .",
    "we decided to use only grbs with a @xmath21 kev peak photon flux @xmath22 exceeding 0.50 ph @xmath23 s@xmath24 , i.e. twice the effective photon flux limit of the gusbad catalog .",
    "this still leaves a large sample of 1319 grbs .",
    "the euclidean value of @xmath13  is simply @xmath13  @xmath25 .",
    "the value of @xmath1  for uniformly distributed objects having any luminosity function in euclidean space is @xmath26 .",
    "this value derives from the fact that volumes are @xmath27 and areas @xmath28 .",
    "this will not apply in non - euclidean space , so for cosmological objects the euclidean value of @xmath1  will deviate from @xmath26 , the more so the larger the typical redshift , i.e. , it is a cosmological distance indicator .",
    "concern has been expressed in the literature about the use of @xmath13 particularly when sample thresholds vary @xcite .",
    "the problem of varying threshold can be handled if each object has its own value of @xmath29 as in the gusbad catalog . in our present study ,",
    "the adopted constant limit of 0.50 ph @xmath23 s@xmath24 is larger than all individual limits in the catalog .",
    "all well defined samples above a given flux limit are subject to the eddington effect @xcite .",
    "random errors in the fluxes of individual objects if positive may cause them to become part of the sample , or , if negative , to be lost .",
    "since there are generally more objects in the flux distribution below any given flux than above , the net effect will be that positive errors dominate in the sample .",
    "the effect on @xmath1  will be that for objects with a uniform distribution , the observed value will be larger than 0.5 .",
    "we can evaluate the eddington effect on @xmath1  of our sample through simulations . on the average , @xmath30 for gusbad fluxes of the second brightest illuminated detector",
    "is @xmath31 ph @xmath23 s@xmath24 .",
    "our adopted limit of @xmath26 ph @xmath23 s@xmath24 ( for detector @xmath32 ) corresponds to @xmath33 ph @xmath23 s@xmath24 for detectors @xmath34 , with @xmath35 ph @xmath23 s@xmath24 .",
    "simulations show that in this case the eddington excess in @xmath1  is @xmath36 , considerably less than the mean errors of @xmath1  for the spectral samples discussed below .",
    "our goal is to derive the peak energy of the @xmath37 spectrum . given the low spectral resolution , we initially derive @xmath38 for a representative energy @xmath39 in each batse channel @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the photon flux density , in ph @xmath23 s@xmath24 kev@xmath24 .",
    "we used the peak photon fluxes to derive the flux densities @xmath41 at @xmath42 30 , 70 , 185 and 420 kev . for channels 13 ,",
    "these energies are close to the geometric means of the energy band limits ; for channel 4 , see below .",
    "an initial estimate of the peak spectral energy is provided by the channel with the largest value of @xmath43 .",
    "table 1 shows for each of the four batse channels the number of grbs having the peak at @xmath39 .",
    "we can compare our @xmath0  values with those given by @xcite for peak fluxes .",
    "their work was based on batse lad data of 350 bright grbs in the batse catalogs .",
    "they used several lad data types , and employed a number of spectral shapes beyond the band spectrum .",
    "the kaneko list has 219 grbs that are in the gusbad catalog .",
    "the last column of table 1 gives the average kaneko peak energy for the gusbad sources in the kaneko list .",
    "we adopt the kaneko average for channel 4 , since there is no well defined upper energy limit to its energy band . only for channel 3",
    "is a meaningful comparison possible : our result differs by only 10% from the kaneko average .    the averages of the euclidean values of @xmath13  for peak energies in channels 1 - 4 are 0.44 , 0.45 , 0.32 , and 0.33 , respectively .",
    "it turns out that the transition from high to low values of @xmath1  takes place within channel 3 .",
    "since it contains a large number of peak energies , we subdivide those in channel 3 based on whether the ratio of @xmath44 is ( a ) less than 0.5 , ( b ) in the range @xmath45 , or ( c ) larger than 1.0 .",
    "given that only 24 objects peak in channel 1 , we combine channels 1 and 2 .",
    "we end up with five spectral peak classes @xmath46 with @xmath1  ranging from @xmath47 to @xmath48 , see table 2 .",
    "the resulting @xmath3  correlation is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "table 2 also gives the mean values of @xmath49 , the photon spectral index derived from batse channels 2 and 3 , as given in the gusbad catalog .",
    "the @xmath50 correlation had been noted before @xcite in a study similar to the present one .",
    "since we do not have redshifts for our sample of gusbad grbs , we can not derive the luminosity function directly .",
    "instead we iterate the luminosity function by trial and error . in each step of the iteration we derive the predicted @xmath1  value for each of the spectral classes until they agree with those given in table 1 .",
    "we assume that the grb luminosity function @xmath51 of spectral class @xmath46 can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the peak luminosity , @xmath54 is the @xmath55 luminosity function of class @xmath46 , and @xmath2the comoving grb rate density , normalized at @xmath55 .",
    "we assume that @xmath54 has a gaussian distribution @xmath56 ^ 2 \\over 2 \\sigma_{\\log l}^2}\\ ] ] with dispersion @xmath11 around a central peak luminosity @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 is the grb rate at @xmath55 .",
    "our approach will be to iterate the value of @xmath57 until the corresponding value of @xmath1@xmath59 for the gusbad sample agrees with the observed value .",
    "this requires a full derivation of the expected source counts from the luminosity function .",
    "the role of @xmath11 is primarily to make each spectral luminosity function  sufficiently wide so that the total luminosity function  is reasonably smooth .",
    "we ended up using @xmath60 .    in deriving fluxes from luminosities and redshifts",
    ", we employ the batse energy range @xmath61 with @xmath62 kev and @xmath63 kev . for an object at redshift @xmath64 , the observed energy range @xmath61 originates in the range @xmath65 in the object s rest frame , whereas the luminosity refers to the range @xmath61 .",
    "the k - term is the ratio of the rest frame energies radiated in the two ranges , @xmath66 the band photon spectrum is ususally described in terms of a break energy @xmath67 . here",
    "we use a band spectrum @xmath68 where @xmath69 assuming that @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "we adopt constant values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 for reasons that will be discussed in section 5 .",
    "the peak flux @xmath73 observed for a grb of luminosity @xmath53 at redshift @xmath64 is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the bolometric luminosity distance .",
    "we use the cosmological parameters @xmath76 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "the integral peak flux distribution for grbs of spectral class @xmath46 is , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is derived from equation ( 4 ) , @xmath81 is the comoving volume and the term @xmath82 represents the time dilation . with this formulation , it is straightforward to derive the differential source counts @xmath83 , as well as the average values of @xmath13 , @xmath0 , @xmath49 , etc .    for a given rate function",
    "@xmath2 the procedure to iterate the luminoxity function is as follows .",
    "assume starting values for the central luminosity @xmath57 and the rest frame band peak energy @xmath84 .",
    "the differential source counts together with @xmath13  @xmath25 produce the expected values of @xmath1@xmath59 for the gusbad catalog .",
    "similarly , the expected values of @xmath0@xmath59 are obtained by weighting @xmath85@xmath86 with the differential source counts .",
    "the iteration is repeated until the expected values of @xmath1@xmath59 and @xmath0@xmath59 match the observed ones given in table 2 .",
    "it is worth noting that given @xmath2  and the shape of the five spectral luminosity functions , the procedure leads for each @xmath46 to a single value for @xmath57 and @xmath84 .",
    "the primary unknown is the density function @xmath2 .",
    "we will use _ swift _  data to test various forms of @xmath2 , see sec .",
    "the _ swift _  mission @xcite is in the process of detecting hundreds of grbs .",
    "thanks to an emphasis on rapid identification and communication , relatively many of these grbs have observed redshifts .",
    "we use this data base to check predicted distributions of redshifts and luminosities based on luminosity functions with different @xmath2 .",
    "we have used _ swift _  grb data for the period jan 1 , 2005 ",
    "sep 30 , 2008 .",
    "the observations cover a field of view of 1.4 sr in the energy band @xmath87 kev .",
    "we use observed peak fluxes over a one second time interval obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) and redshift information from j. greiner s list .",
    "we derive isotropic - equivalent luminosities for the energy band @xmath87 kev using the rest frame @xmath5  correlation given in section 6 . in deriving these luminosities",
    ", we assumed a malmquist correction @xmath88 , see section 6 .",
    "the _ swift _  mission does not provide a flux limit above which the sample of grbs is complete .",
    "@xcite has analyzed the sensitivity of _ swift _  in detail .",
    "he concludes that the complexity of the trigger system maximizes the sensitivity , but `` makes an accurate determination of this sensitivity at a given time very difficult if not impossible . ''",
    "given these circumstances , we have to carry out an _ a posteriori _ estimate of the effective flux limit above which the burst list is complete .    following the procedure outlined in section 3",
    ", we can derive the predicted distributions of fluxes , luminosities and redshifts for _ swift_. the predicted flux distribution turns out to be virtually the same for all forms of @xmath2  discussed in the next section .",
    "we show the distribution in figure 2 , together with the observed number of grbs and the number of grbs with observed redshifts . at large fluxes",
    ", the prediction appears to be around @xmath89 below the observed numbers .",
    "the observed numbers start to deviate systematically below the prediction at @xmath90 ph @xmath23 s@xmath24 .",
    "we adopt this flux as the effective completeness limit for the _ swift _  bursts .",
    "the total number of grbs above the flux limit is 217 , of which 84 have redshifts .",
    "the fraction of grbs with redshifts declines from @xmath91 at large flux to @xmath92 at the limit .",
    "we will assume that a redshift fraction of 0.4 applies uniformly above the flux limit .    with the _ swift _  flux limit and the fraction with redshifts set , we are now in a position to derive from the luminosity function for a given @xmath2the predicted distributions of luminosity and redshift for the _ swift_sample .",
    "as discussed at the end of sec .",
    "3 , the only unknown in deriving the grb luminosity function , given the @xmath3correlation , is the redshift dependence @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we can view the excercise as one in which we explore which shape of @xmath2  is compatible with the observations based on _ swift _  data .",
    "we first explore the case where @xmath2  is the galaxy star formation history ( sfh ) . in the many published studies of star formation in the literature ,",
    "the sfh rises fast with redshift by about an order of magnitude out to @xmath93 , beyond which it levels off ; it tends to decline beyond @xmath94 .",
    "we use the analytical expression , normalized to @xmath55 , @xmath95 for the sfh described by @xcite , based on an extensive compilation by @xcite .    the predicted distributions of luminosity and redshift",
    "are compared to the _ swift _",
    "observations in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the predicted number of grbs ( with redshifts ) is 79.6 , while the observed number is 84 .",
    "the prediction is @xmath96 below the observed number .",
    "it is obvious that the agreement with the observations is poor , both for the luminosities and the redshifts .",
    "we have carried out monte carlo simulations to find the probability @xmath97 that the observed number of luminosities above @xmath98 can be produced from the predicted distribution by chance .",
    "we find @xmath99 .",
    "similarly , for redshifts above 3.0 the probability @xmath100 , see table 3 .",
    "even if we continue the sfh beyond the peak redshift @xmath101 at its peak value without any downturn , the agreement remains poor , with @xmath99 and @xmath102 .",
    "clearly , the sfh can not represent @xmath2 .    with little guidance as to what the shape of @xmath2  could be",
    ", we use a simple schematic involving a @xmath103 power law rise , a plateau , and an exponential decline with @xmath64 , as follows : @xmath104    with the goal of producing redshift and luminosity distributions more in accord with the observed _ swift _  distributions , we explored a number of combinations of the free parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 . we concluded from these explorations that to first order the ratio @xmath107 is crucial .",
    "this appears related to the fact that most _ swift _",
    "bursts have redshifts below 2 . for the sfh considered above , the ratio @xmath108 .",
    "we present detailed results for two shapes of @xmath2  that have r - values of 3.2 ( a ) and 4.0 ( b ) , respectively .",
    "table 4 and figure 5 illustrate the two cases .",
    "case a rises by a factor of 32 to @xmath109 and then remains constant .",
    "case b rises slower to a plateau of 25 starting at @xmath110 .",
    "we have not actually included the exponential decline beyond @xmath111 .",
    "with ony two redshifts with @xmath112 in the _ swift _  sample , we have no observational leverage on the value of @xmath111 .",
    "the properties of the two models are given in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "both are successful in producing luminosity and redshift distributions compatible with the _ swift _  data , see figures 6 and 7 .",
    "the redshift distributions predict that @xmath113 of grbs in the _ swift _  sample have @xmath114 and @xmath115 @xmath116 . since we have allowed the density plateau to continue beyond @xmath117 , these percentages are overestimates .",
    "our predictions are lower than most discussed in the literature .    in deriving the luminosity functions",
    ", we found that the spectral indices @xmath49 given in table 2 are best represented by the band spectral parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we show the observed average spectral index @xmath49 for the five spectral classes versus @xmath0  in figure 8 , together with the relation derived from the luminosity functions .",
    "we illustrate in figure 9 the derivation of @xmath57 from the observed @xmath1  values for case a. the differences in the curves reflect the different values of @xmath6  for the spectral classes . for the gusbad sample ,",
    "the curves are only meaningful near the actual @xmath57 values .",
    "for , say , a deeper sample , the applicable parts would be at correspondingly higher luminosities .",
    "figure 10 shows the predicted distribution of redshifts for the gusbad sample , again based on case a. for @xmath118 essentially all the redshifts are expected to be below 1 .",
    "this component is very uncertain , as discussed below .",
    "the peak redshifts for the different spectral classes reflect their @xmath1  values .",
    "this illustrates clearly that the euclidean @xmath1  is a cosmological distance indicator .    in figure 11",
    "we show the luminosity function for case a , as well as the luminosity distribution for the 1319 gusbad sources with @xmath119 ph @xmath23 s@xmath24 . also shown",
    "are the individual luminosity functions for the five spectral classes .",
    "the first peak of the luminosity function is contributed by spectral class 1 .",
    "the lower half of its gaussian clearly plays no role , as it produces no objects in the luminosity distribution .",
    "the luminosity assigned to this class is uncertain , since the slope of the curve in figure 9 is relatively shallow .",
    "actually , if the @xmath1  for @xmath120 were only @xmath121 larger , it could not be reproduced by any value of @xmath122 .",
    "altogether , this suggests that the ( large ) @xmath55 density rates @xmath123 for @xmath118 given in table 4 are very uncertain .",
    "the second peak in the luminosity function is contributed by the large number of grbs in spectral classes 2 - 5 .",

    "@xmath6  correlations with radiated energy or luminosity are of interest in exploring the mechanism for the prompt emission of grbs .",
    "they are also of practical interest in allowing an estimation of the redshift of grbs with measured @xmath0 . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the derivation of the relevant isotropic - equivalent luminosity @xmath126 , present the @xmath4  and @xmath5  correlations and briefly mention the problem of extracting individual redshifts from @xmath6  correlations .",
    "as discussed in section 3 , the derivation of the luminosity function involves an iteration of the central luminosity @xmath57 , where each spectral component is a gaussian with dispersion @xmath11 .",
    "we chose a dispersion @xmath11@xmath127 that produces a reasonably smooth overall luminosity function .",
    "we want to use the @xmath57 luminosities in deriving the isotropic - equivalent peak luminosities",
    "@xmath126  used in the correlations .",
    "it turns out , however , that @xmath57 varies considerably with @xmath11 .",
    "we explored using @xmath11  values ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 in deriving the luminosity function  for cases a and b. for all values of @xmath11   the agreement with the observed luminosities and redshifts of the _ swift _  grbs is good .",
    "the variation of @xmath128 appears to be proportional to @xmath129 .",
    "the explanation of the situation is as follows .",
    "as @xmath11  is increased , the wings of the gaussian will provide more objects with higher and lower luminosities .",
    "the higher luminosities will be at larger distances and contribute lower @xmath13  values .",
    "the lower luminosities will contribute higher @xmath13 but the shift will be less due to the curvature of the relation between @xmath57 and @xmath13 , see figure 9 .",
    "the asymmetry results in a higher value of @xmath1 requiring a shift to a lower @xmath57 in order to fit the observed input value of @xmath1 .",
    "the reason why agreement with the _ swift _",
    "observations is not affected , is that the additional objects of lower luminosity contribute little to the observed distributions because they are observed over much smaller volumes .",
    "given our understanding of the variation of @xmath57 with @xmath11 , it is clear that we want to use the unbiased values of @xmath128 at @xmath11@xmath130 in deriving the @xmath126 .",

    "the line drawn represents a regression of @xmath126  on @xmath0 , assuming that the @xmath0  values are errorless , @xmath134    the derivation of the luminosity function involved an iteration not only of the central luminosity @xmath57 , but also of the rest frame value of the band peak energy @xmath85 .",

    ", we can produce redshifts for all 1319 grbs without problems .",

    "the malmquist biases for @xmath142 are @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively , for an average of @xmath145 .",
    "this value is tantalizingly close to the offset shown in eq .",
    "( 13 ) . however , our values are based on an assumed gaussian shape of the spectral luminosity functions with a dispersion of @xmath60 , designed to make the overall luminosity function reasonably smooth . as long as we do not have reliable information about the distribution of @xmath146",
    "at given @xmath6  in space , we will not be able to assess the effect of malmquist bias accurately .",
    "we present in this final section some commentary on the approach used in this paper and on the results .",
    "this work validates the use of @xmath1  as a cosmological distance indicator .",
    "it requires a complete sample of grbs above a well defined flux limit .",
    "the gusbad catalog with its uniform treatment of all sources is eminently useful for this purpose .",
    "the input in the form of @xmath1  forced us to a deductive approach where we used a given shape of the ( spectral ) luminosity function and iterated its center luminosity and rest frame @xmath6  until the observed @xmath1  and @xmath0  were fit .",
    "an important advantage of the deductive method is that the derivation of source counts from a given luminosity function can be carried out accurately .",
    "this approach is in contrast to the inductive method generally used when redshifts are available .",
    "this involves deriving densities in bins of redshift and luminosity and correlating these with redshift and/or luminosity to derive the luminosity function .",
    "in such an approach , it is essential to check that the resulting luminosity function produces the input source counts and @xmath1  correctly . if this is not the case , predictions about expected numbers of sources at large redshift will be unrealistic @xcite .",
    "if grbs were not subject to cosmological evolution , the input in terms of @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath147 would suffice to derive the luminosity function  and hence predict source counts and the redshift and luminosity distributions . comparing these predictions with the observations , such as from _",
    "swift _ , would then constitute a check on the cosmological model . in reality",
    ", there is evolution , so in the context of the present study the _ swift _  observations of grbs with redshifts essentially provide information about @xmath2 .",
    "we have indicated that our exploration of various forms for @xmath2indicate that the _ swift _",
    "observations seemed to require that the @xmath148 ratio be at least 3 .",
    "none of the star formation results shown in figure 1 of @xcite exhibit such a ratio .",
    "@xcite explored a variety of grb rate curves and found the best fit for their model sfr6 , for which @xmath149 .",
    "given that grbs tend to occur in blue , underluminous galaxies of limited chemical evolution @xcite , it is not surprising that @xmath2  is different from the main cosmic star formation , and concentrated to earlier cosmic times .",
    "a study of the hydrogen ionization rate , based on the lyman-@xmath150 forest @xcite , concludes that the star formation rate is increasing for @xmath151 , qualitatively much like our model b.    \\5 .",
    "we have been conservative in setting the effective completeness limit for the _ swift _  data at @xmath90 ph @xmath23 s@xmath24 and using only data above the limit",
    ". it would be helpful if catalogs of _ swift _  sources could include an indication for each source whether it can be considered to be part of a sample that is complete above a given photon limit over a given area .",
    "even while not all individual grbs can be fitted with a band spectrum , it appears that for statistical work , the @xmath5  correlation together with fixed values for @xmath71 and @xmath72 provide a surprisingly simple prescription .",
    "\\7 . in comparing @xmath5  and @xmath8  correlations ,",
    "the transformation from the actual energy bands used , like @xmath21 or @xmath87 kev , to @xmath138 kev @xcite introduces needless uncertainty .",
    "it would be preferable to report results in the observed energy bands .",
