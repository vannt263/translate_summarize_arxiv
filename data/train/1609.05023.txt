    "approximating the induced electrical polarization by a dipole moment@xcite , its magnitude scales linearly with the applied dc voltage . since the electric field gradient is also directly proportional to the dc voltage , the resonance frequency of the nanomechanical string resonator shifts quadratically with the applied dc bias@xcite . by means of careful sample design ,",
    "the in - plane polarized vibration mode can be engineered to shift downwards in resonance frequency with increasing dc bias , whereas the out - of - plane polarized resonance tunes towards higher resonance frequencies@xcite .",

    "this normalization process can lead to return probabilities exceeding a value of unity due to experimental scatter and different characteristic signal power heights at the initialization and read - out voltage .",

    "the ramps consist of a total of 500,000samples ( 500ksa ) divided into four basic regions .",
    "the first region is a @xmath209ms long window in which a trigger command is sent from to the afg to the spectrum analyzer to start the measurement , during which the additional ramp voltage is kept at zero and hence the absolute voltage is at base level @xmath11 of the initialization voltage .",

    ", the exponential decay of the returning excitation has to be measured at a different read - out frequency since the resonant sinusoidal drive tone at fixed frequency @xmath10 can not be turned off during the voltage ramp .",

    "it is important to note that the voltage off - set has to be adjusted in such a way , that the mechanical resonance at the read - out voltage @xmath18 is not excited by the resonant drive tone at @xmath10 .",
    "the exponential decay of the mechanical resonance after the triangular voltage ramp is measured in region three using a spectrum analyzer in a timespan of @xmath213 after the measurement , the absolute voltage is ramped back from @xmath15 to the initialization voltage @xmath11 ( region four ) by decreasing the sweep voltage from @xmath214 to zero , which takes 100samples of the total sample number of 500ksa .",
