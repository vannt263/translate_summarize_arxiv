    "one of the most counter - intuitive features of quantum mechanics is its nonlocal nature , which leads to fundamental departure from classical physics . over the years ,",
    "investigation on nonlocality of a quantum system has been centred around entanglement , non - classical correlation between different parts of a composite system -a valuable resource for various information processing task @xcite . since the pioneering work of bell @xcite",
    ", entanglement is believed to be the only manifestation of quantum nonlocality . in other words ,",
    "entangled states are beyond the purview of local hidden variable model and hence violate bell s inequality .",
    "further exploration of composite system revealed the intriguing complexity in quantum states .",
    "in particular , werner showed that while all pure entangled states violate bell s inequality , _ all _ mixed entangled states do _ not _ violate the inequality @xcite .",
    "this is attributed to the presence of noise or mixedness , which are responsible in destroying nonlocal correlation between different parts of the composite system , and hence some of the mixed entangled states behave locally @xcite .",
    "it is now broadly accepted that entanglement is _ not _ the complete manifestation of nonlocality .    in light of this ,",
    "better quantification of quantum nonlocality is instructive to reveal the complexity of composite states .",
    "recently , luo and fu presented a new measure of nonlocality for bipartite system in the perspective of measurements , termed as measurement induced nonlocality ( min ) @xcite .",
    "this quantity is in a sense complementary to the geometric measure of quantum discord @xcite . in other words",
    ", min can quantify the nonlocal resource in quantum communication protocols involving local measurement .",
    "it is worth noting that pre- and post - measurement states and found to be useful in some of the information processing like quantum dense coding , remote state control and quantum state steering @xcite .",
    "min characterizes nonlocality of a quantum state in the perspective of locally invariant projective measurements , and hence more general than the bell nonlocality",
    ". one important merit of this quantity is that it can be evaluated analytically for any @xmath0-dimensional state .",
    "however , there is a problem with this geometric ( hilbert - schmidt norm ) min that it may change rather arbitrarily through some trivial and uncorrelated action of the unmeasured party - local ancilla problem . as shown elsewhere",
    "@xcite , this issue can be resolved by replacing density matrix with its square root .",
    "min has also been investigated based on relative entropy @xcite , von neumann entropy @xcite , skew information @xcite and trace distance @xcite .",
    "further , min has been investigated for bound entangled states @xcite , general bipartite system @xcite and heisenberg spin chains @xcite .",
    "the dynamics and monogamy of measurement induced nonlocality also has been studied @xcite .    in this article , we propose the min based on fidelity induced metric .",
    "it is shown that this quantity is remedying the local ancilla problem associated with the geometric min and also easy to measure .",
    "we derive an analytical expression of fidelity based min for pure state , which coincides with the geometric min ( discord ) .",
    "further , we provide an upper bound for arbitrary @xmath1 dimensional mixed state and a closed formula for @xmath0 dimensional mixed state . the new version of min is also shown to be consistent with other forms of min for two well - known families of states , namely werner and isotropic states .",
    "fidelity is a measure of closeness between two arbitrary states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , defined as @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this measure has been explored in various context of quantum information processing such as cloning @xcite , teleportation @xcite , quantum state tomography @xcite , quantum chaos @xcite and spotlighting phase transition in physical systems @xcite .",
    "though fidelity itself is not a metric , one can define a metric @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath7 , and is required to satisfy all the axioms of distance measure .",
    "few such fidelity induced metrics are bures angle @xmath8 , bures metric @xmath9 and sine metric @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "let us consider a bipartite quantum state @xmath2 shared by the parties @xmath11 and @xmath12 with respective system state spaces @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "originally min is defined as the square of hilbert - schmidt norm of difference of pre- and post - measurement state i.e. , @xcite @xmath31 where the maximum is taken over all local projective measurements .",
    "one problem of this geometric min is that it may change rather arbitrarily through some trivial and uncorrelated action on the unmeasured party @xmath12 .",
    "this arises from appending an uncorrelated ancilla @xmath32 and regarding the state @xmath33 as a bipartite state with the partition @xmath34 ; then @xmath35 implying that min differs arbitrarily due to local ancilla @xmath32 as long as @xmath36 is mixed .",
    "this problem of min can be circumvented with the fidelity based min as defined in eq .",

    "after the addition of local ancilla the fidelity between the pre - and post - measurement state is @xmath37 using multiplicativity property of fidelity @xcite , @xmath38 resulting the property ( v ) of the fidelity based min . hence @xmath39 is a good measure of nonlocality or quantumness in a given system .",
