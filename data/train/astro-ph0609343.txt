    "structural components of galaxies like bars , bulges , ovals and bar - related resonance rings are among the key factors for evaluating when present - day galaxies formed and how they evolve over time .",
    "bulges in early - type disk galaxies are generally assumed to be old , formed through hierarchical clustering , but they might also be more recent structures assembled by internal dynamical processes in galaxies . in favorable conditions these processes might lead to transformation of spirals into s0s , through gas stripping in the halo and the disk ( bekki , warrick @xmath5 yashuro 2002 ) , or due to strong and sustained star formation in the central regions of galaxies ( kormendy @xmath5 kennicutt , hereafter kk2004 ) .    0.25 cm in these secular evolutionary processes the relative mass of the bulge increases .",
    "in case of gas stripping the bulges should have older stellar populations than the disks and their surface brightness profiles are expected to resemble more the @xmath6 law than the exponential function .",
    "however , due to a small amount of gas in s0s , star formation is not expected to be the dominant mechanism for the growth of the bulge , unless exceptionally strong accretion of external gas is taking place in these galaxies .",
    "bulge - like mass concentrations can form also through resonant scattering or through bending instabilities in the central regions of primary bars ( pfenniger 1984 ; raha et al .",
    "1991 ) , in which case these so called `` pseudo - bulges '' should have similar stellar populations as the underlying bars . in order to evaluate the possible role of these processes in galaxy evolution , the properties of bars , ovals and bulges need to be systematically studied in the spiral / s0 divide , e.g. through sa , s0/a , to s0@xmath7 , s0@xmath8 types .",
    "0.25 cm secondary processes in galaxy evolution are generally tied to the growth of a bulge in one way or another , but an alternative approach was also discussed by van den bergh ( 1979 , 1998 ) , who outlined the ddo system of classification in terms of a nurture theory . in this classification system , s0s form a sequence parallel to spirals with types s0a , s0b , and s0c being the s0 analogues of sa , sb , and sc galaxies . a difficulty with this approach has been that no s0c galaxies have been found so far , that is , clear s0 galaxies showing a bulge to total luminosity ratio similar to an sc galaxy . however , this might be a bias due to the fact that application of too simple analysis methods can easily hide the real nature of bulges , particularly in s0s which have rich morphological structures .",
    "0.25 cm    to our knowledge no previous systematic morphological study of galaxies has been carried out in the spiral / s0 divide in the near - infrared . also ,",
    "although 2-dimensional decompositions have become a standard , even in recent studies ( de souza , gadotti @xmath5 dos anjos 2004 , hereafter sga2004 ; christlein @xmath5 zabludoff 2004 ) multiple structures have not been taken into account .",
    "the current study is a third paper in a series where morphological properties of a sample of 170 early - type disk galaxies are studied .",

    "( 2006 , in press ) .",
    "in paper i we found , for a subsample of 24 s0-s0/a galaxies , that the @xmath4 flux ratios are significantly smaller , and the bulges more disk - like , than generally assumed for their morphological type . in paper",
    "ii we investigate in detail the fourier properties of early - type bars and ovals , and identify bars , which are well described in terms of single or double gaussian components of the relative fourier amplitudes of density . in this study",
    "we analyze the morphological properties of 15 southern galaxies of the de vaucouleurs revised hubble types s0@xmath8 to sa , mainly s0s , with a large range of apparent bar strengths .",
    "for these galaxies we use @xmath0-band images to derive the orientation parameters from the elliptical isophotes , apply fourier methods for calculating non - axisymmetric forces , and perform 2d multicomponent structural decompositions .",
    "the multicomponent decompositions are compared with more simple bulge / disk decompositions and with 1d decompositions for the same galaxies",

    "therefore in this case the 1d method gives a more reliable estimate of @xmath41 .",
    "it is due to these exceptional cases that makes the small difference in the mean @xmath41 obtained by the 1d and 2d methods in table 7 . in conclusion",
    ", we did not find any evidence supporting the view that for multicomponent galaxies the 2d method automatically gives better results than the 1d method .",
    "this is the case only if , in addition to the bulge and the disk , at least one more component is included to the 2d fit",
    "for any hypothesis of galaxy evolution it is important to understand whether bulges in galaxies are old classical bulges , or pseudo - bulges formed at later phases of galaxy evolution .",
    "the main approaches for evaluating this are the kinematic and photometric approaches .",
    "bulges are expected to have the characteristics of pseudo - bulges mainly when @xmath88 2 ( kk2004 ) .",
    "this might be the case also when the bulge is oriented near to the plane of the outer disk , or the ellipticity of the bulge is near to that of the outer disk .",
    "however , the bulge is not necessarily aligned with the disk .",
    "s0s might have many disks with different orientations , of which ngc 1411 is a good example .",
    "it is also assumed by kk2004 that if a galaxy has a secondary bar or a nuclear ring inside the bulge , the bulge is most probably a young pseudo - bulge .",
    "even more direct evidence for the existence of a pseudo - bulge can be obtained kinematically : if the ratio of the maximum velocity amplitude ( v@xmath89 ) to the mean stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath90 ) at the same radius , v@xmath91 , versus the ellipticity ( @xmath19 ) is above the isotropic oblate rotator curve @xcite , the bulge is kinematically supported .",
    "this means that stars of the bulge have not had time to gain such large random velocities as in the case of older classical bulges .",
    "unfortunately useful kinematic data is available only for a few galaxies in our sample .",
    "0.25 cm    we found strong evidence of pseudo - bulges in the non - elliptical galaxies in our sample .",
    "the shape parameter of the bulge is smaller than 2 in six of the 12 galaxies , and near to @xmath1=2 in ten of the galaxies . for ngc 3358",
    "no decomposition could be made , but as discussed above , the bulge also for this galaxy is very small , most probably having the characteristics of pseudo - bulges .",
    "larger @xmath1-values for the bulge were detected only for ngc 1326 ( @xmath1 = 3.0 ) and ngc 1574 ( @xmath1 = 2.9 ) , but even ngc 1326 has a nuclear star forming ring , and for ngc 1574 there is strong kinematic evidence showing that the bulge is rotationally supported . for ngc 1574",
    "we use @xmath90 and v@xmath89 measured by jarvis et al.(1988 ) .",
    "they found v@xmath89(obs ) = 40 km  sec@xmath92 along the major axis , and after correcting the inclination effect this is converted to v@xmath89(corr ) = 145 km  sec@xmath92 .",
    "based on our surface brightness profile , the galaxy is bulge dominated at r = 6 arcsec , at which radius @xmath90 = 180 km  sec@xmath92 and @xmath19 = 0.1 ( taken from our @xmath19-profile in fig .",
    "the obtained v@xmath89/@xmath90 = 0.8 , which at @xmath19 = 0.1 means that the bulge is rotationally supported . in a similar manner v@xmath89/@xmath90",
    "were found for the galaxies ngc 1553 , ngc 3100 , ngc 3706 and es0 208-g21 . for ngc 3100 we used v@xmath89(corr ) = 120",
    "km  sec@xmath92 and @xmath90 = 190 km  sec@xmath92 ( carollo , danziger @xmath5 buson 1993 ) .",
    "the measurements were made at the position angle of 90@xmath22 , which deviates only 10@xmath22 from the orientation of the major axis of the disk . in the bulge - dominated region at @xmath27 = 5 - 10 arcsec this means that the bulge is rotationally supported . for ngc 1553",
    "we use v@xmath89(corr ) = 156 km  sec@xmath92 and @xmath90 = 162 km  sec@xmath92 at @xmath27 = 10 arcsec ( kormendy 1984 ) , which also in this case means that the bulge is rotationally supported .",
    "quite interestingly , according to kormendy the bright lens dominating at larger radial distances is hotter and not rotationally supported , indicating that _ the lens is probably older than the bulge_. as expected , the elliptical galaxies ngc 3706 and eso 208-g21 have neither kinematic nor photometric evidence of pseudo - bulges .",
    "four of the galaxies in our sample have also either a nuclear ring , a secondary bar or both , and generally the nuclear ring is presently forming stars . in conclusion , all galaxies with extended disks in our sample have some sign of a pseudo - bulge .",
    "pseudo - bulges have been previously found in many late - type spirals ( carollo et al . 1998 ) , and more recently also in two early - type spirals ( kormendy et al .",
    "2006 ) with the hubble types sab and sa .",
    "0.25 cm    an other interesting new finding of this study is that the bulges of two s0s in our sample are as small as in typical sc - type spirals . for ngc 1411 @xmath4=0.08 in comparison to",
    "0.11 found in sc - galaxies .",
    "for ngc 3100 the bulge is also very small , but could not be fitted in our decompositions .",
    "both galaxies are dominated by lenses , ngc 1411 by a series of bright lenses , and ngc 3100 by one dominant lens / oval .",
    "the bulge in ngc 1411 is disk - like ( have small @xmath1 ) , but none of the two galaxies have a nuclear ring , or other strong morphological signatures of strong star formation in the central regions of these galaxies .",
    "the bulge in ngc 1553 most probably is also extremely small , unless the inner disk ( with obvious spiral arms ) is considered as a pseudo - bulge . to our knowledge",
    "ngc 1411 and ngc 3100 are the first candidates that might be analogs of sc - galaxies among s0s , with similar @xmath4- flux ratios as typically found in sc - galaxies .",
    "the existence of such galaxies has been earlier suggested in the ddo classification scheme by van den bergh ( 1976 , 1998 ) .",
    "these two galaxies are extreme examples of s0s that would be difficult to explain by merging of large disk galaxies .",
    "ngc 1411 is found to be a member of the dorado group of 46 galaxies ( sandage 1975 ; maia , da costa @xmath5 latham 1989 ) , which is one of the richest galaxy groups in the southern hemisphere . using a more strict definition of a group , garcia ( 1993 ) found the same galaxy to be a member of a small group of galaxies .",
    "ngc 1411 has also one major nearby companion , whereas ngc 3100 has many small nearby companions . particularly in case of ngc 1411",
    "it is possible that a late - type spiral has transformed to an s0c type system by stripping mechanisms .",
    "0.25 cm    ovals or lenses were found in 11 of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "ovals have minor to major axis ratios between 0.85 and 0.89 , in agreement with the previous estimations by kormendy ( 1984 ) for typical ovals .",
    "however , the presence of lenses is more difficult to show , because their isophotes are not necessarily elongated .",
    "this is also the reason why they are not always detected while classifying galaxies . in the decompositions made in this study",
    ", the lenses can be best recognized due to the model images ( produced in the structural decompositions ) that should have the observed galaxy morphologies . in many cases a good agreement between the model image and the observation was found only if a flat inner structure was also added to the fit .",
    "galaxies with prominent lenses in our sample typically have multiple exponential parts in their surface brightness profiles .",
    "0.25 cm bars , bulges and halos are related phenomena in galaxies .",
    "it has been shown by the theoretical models ( see the review by athanassoula 2005 ) that the properties of bars are formed in a complicated process between the halo and the disk , for example depending on the mass of the halo , the amount of halo mass in the resonances , or the mass distribution of the bulge .",
    "when these properties are favorable to angular momentum exchange between the halo and the disk , bars are expected to evolve over time , leading to more massive bars with larger quadrupole moments . as bars loose angular momentum in this process",
    "these models also predict that bars gradually slow down .",
    "however , the models are still controversial . while the bar appears to slow down in most n - body models ( hernquist @xmath5 weinberg 1992 ; debattista @xmath5 sellwood 2000 ; athanassoula 2003 ; sellwood 2003 ; holley - bockelmann , weinberg @xmath5 katz 2005 ) , there are some other models in which the bar slow down is barely visible over the hubble time ( valenzuela @xmath5 klypin 2003 ) .",
    "also , because long bars in early - type disk galaxies are repeatedly found to be fast rotating systems ( see the review by debattista 2006 ) it is not clear that the longest bars are necessarily the most evolved bars . in this study",
    "it is interesting to look at whether the properties of bars in s0s are similar or fundamentally different from the properties of bars in early - type spirals . 0.25 cm    in table 8 we compare the mean properties of primary bars in different hubble type bins . the properties for sbc - sm ( t = 4 - 9 ) type galaxies are from lsb2004 , based on a similar analysis for the galaxies in the osubg - survey . in order to increase the statistics for the sa - sab type spirals ,",
    "the data is a collection from three samples : the osubgs , the sample of early - type disk galaxies by lsb2005 , and this study .",
    "there is a clear tendency showing that bar length increases from the late - type spirals towards the early - type spirals , as first suggested by elmegreen @xmath5 elmegreen ( 1985 ) .",
    "the maximum is reached for the hubble type s0/a , but bars in s0s are clearly shorter than bars in s0/a galaxies , although still longer than bars in late - type spirals .",
    "this is in agreement with the recent result obtained by erwin ( 2005 ) .",
    "the relative mass of the bar , as estimated from the @xmath32 and @xmath33 fourier amplitudes of density , has a similar tendency .",
    "however , the bar induced maximum tangential force , @xmath28 , decreases all the way from late - type spirals towards earlier types , reaching a minimum for s0s .",
    "the fact that @xmath28 is slightly smaller in s0s is due more to the smaller bar size and mass than to dilution by the bulge , because the b / t ratios in s0s and s0/a galaxies are fairly similar . the way how massive bulges dilute @xmath28 was shown in lsb2004 .",
    "0.25 cm    an interesting result in this study is that the properties of bars in the spiral / s0 divide , e.g. between the s0/a and s0-galaxies are not exactly similar , or explainable by the dilution effects of bulges .",
    "bars in s0s are shorter ( 1.21 v.s . 1.72 , respectively ) and less massive ( @xmath32 = 0.49 v.s .",
    "0.63 ) than bars in s0/a - galaxies .",
    "the fact that @xmath28 is slightly smaller in s0s is associated to the mass of the bar rather than to the dilution by bulge , because the b / t - ratios is s0s and s0/a - galaxies are fairly similar ( @xmath28= 0.24 @xmath930.14 v.s .",
    "0.27 @xmath93 0.17 ) .",
    "the weaker bars in s0s might be due to a smaller amount of interstellar gas in these galaxies , which is expected to make the disks less reactive to bar formation .",
    "bars in s0s might be shorter and less massive also because they are less evolved in time ( see the models by athanassoula 2003 ) . 0.25 cm",
    "a morphological analysis of a sample of 15 early - type disk galaxies , mainly s0s , has been presented in the @xmath0-band .",
    "the sample is part of a more complete nirs0s - sample of 170 s0-s0/a galaxies , selected to have a similar size and selection criteria as in the osubgs - sample for spirals .",
    "our main idea is to characterize the properties of bars , ovals and bulges for a large sample of galaxies in the spiral / s0 divide and to use this information to evaluate the origin of s0s and how they are related to spirals .",
    "0.25 cm    the galaxies were analyzed by applying fourier methods for calculating the maximum gravitational torques , and by applying a multicomponent 2d method for structural decompositions .",
    "a generalized sersic s function is used for the bulge and exponential function for the disk , whereas the other non - axisymmetric components can be described either by a sersic s or a ferrers function .",
    "it was also possible to take into account the flattening and the shape parameter of the structures . for comparison",
    "1d decomposition method was also used .",
    "we found that if only the bulge and the disk are fitted , 1d and 2d methods give fairly similar results ( @xmath86 = 0.55 - 0.61 ) .",
    "0.25 cm    bars in the galaxies in our sample are typically surrounded by lenses , and four of the galaxies have double bar / lens structures .",
    "two of the galaxies classified as s0s in rc3 appeared to be elliptical galaxies ( eso 208-g21 , ngc 3706 ) , and three of the non - barred s0s were found to have inner disks ( ngc 1411 , ngc 3100 , ngc 1553 ) .",
    "a previously non - detected nuclear ring was discovered in ngc 1387 , and a nuclear bar in ngc 1326 .",
    "we found that bars in s0s are not exactly similar to bars in s0/a - galaxies .",
    "they are clearly shorter and less massive and have slightly weaker bar torques than bars in s0/a - galaxies .",
    "0.25 cm    one of the most important results of this study is the finding that _ 11 non - elliptical galaxies in our sample show strong evidence of having disk - like pseudo - bulges _ : these bulges have surface brightness profiles that are more close to an exponential than to a de vaucouleurs type profile .",
    "six of the galaxies also have either nuclear rings , nuclear bars or nuclear disks .",
    "all galaxies in our sample have @xmath94 0.4 as typically found in galaxies having pseudo - bulges .",
    "we find @xmath86 = 0.25 and @xmath87 = 2 , thus confirming the earlier result by lsb2005 , showing that bulges in s0s are considerably smaller and have more exponential surface brightness profiles than assumed for their morphological types .",
    "a comparison to more simple 2d bulge / disk or 1d - decompositions shows the importance of the multicomponent approach : these two methods give @xmath86 = 0.55 - 0.48 , respectively , in both cases the relative mass of the bulge being significantly overestimated .",
    "the value @xmath86 = 0.55 is close to the value 0.64 obtained by sga2004 for the early - type disk galaxies in the same wavelength , using a similar 2d bulge / disk approach as used in this study",
    ". 0.25 cm    quite interestingly , we also find two galaxies , ngc 1411 and ngc 3100 , which due to their very small @xmath4 flux ratios might be proverbial analogues of sc galaxies among classical s0s , as discussed in the ddo galaxy classification scheme by van den bergh .",
    "these galaxies might be manifestations of galaxy evolution in the hubble sequence , possibly formed by gas stripping mechanisms from late - type spirals .",
