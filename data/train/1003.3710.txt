    "constrained systems are those having constraints on their degrees of freedom .",
    "when a constraint is imposed on spatial coordinates , the constraint is called a `` holonomic constraint''@xcite .",
    "constrained systems are useful and simple , because of which they are widely used as model systems .",
    "an example of such a model system is a freely jointed chain  @xcite , which is a model composed of one - dimensional chain ( 1d ) of @xmath0 masses such that the distances between adjacent masses are constant .",
    "the freely jointed chain is known as a simplified model of polymers . in computational software packages such as charmm",
    "@xcite and amber  @xcite for molecular dynamics calculations , the shake and rattle algorithms enable one to treat model systems as constrained ones by setting distances between atoms as constant . as a result , the computational task can be made much easier , and then , physically important results can be obtained . in molecular dynamics calculations ,",
    "water molecules are often treated as having a fixed shape , where the length of bonds between hydrogen and oxygen atoms is fixed  @xcite . in both cases , we replace the bond between atoms with a rigid link when the frequency of bond vibration is extremely high .",
    "it is known that in a constrained system , the equipartition of energy occurs in a somewhat complicated way , and the average kinetic energies of particles @xmath1 can take different values for particles located at different places in the system  @xcite . in the generalized form of equipartition",
    "@xcite , what is equal among degrees of freedom is not @xmath1 but @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the momentum conjugate to the generalized coordinate @xmath4 of the @xmath5th degree of freedom , and @xmath6 is the kinetic energy of the system . in constrained systems , @xmath6 depends on coordinates and @xmath3 is no longer equal to @xmath7 ; therefore @xmath8 , whose average takes the same value for all @xmath5 , is not equal to @xmath9 .",
    "recently , we found that for a chain - type system , termed a planar chain model , the average kinetic energy of each particle differs systematically ; that is , particles near both the ends of the chain have relatively large average kinetic energies  @xcite .",
    "this model consists of masses connected by rigid links ; since the distances between adjacent masses are fixed in this model , it is a constrained system .",
    "it is the constraint that induces the nonuniformity of average kinetic energies",
    ". the abovementioned energetic motion of end particles observed in the model would be useful in understanding the dynamical behavior of chain - type systems such as polymers  @xcite , dnas , proteins  @xcite , and some artificial objects such as manipulator arms of spacecraft .",
    "thus far , we have described the behavior of constrained systems . however , strictly speaking , a constrained system or rigid link does not exist in the real world .",
    "when the potentials of a system are somewhat steep , i.e. , spring constants are quite large and the frequency of bond vibration is reasonably high , we approximate the bonds with rigid links . a rigid link or holonomic constraint",
    "is an idealized limit of a stiff spring .    however ,",
    "if we replace the rigid links with springs , say spring - chain model , the usual expression of equipartition of energy , i.e. , @xmath10 , holds regardless of the magnitude of the spring constant @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the spatial dimension .",
    "in other words , although a spring - chain system , made by replacing rigid links in the planar chain system with springs , appears to behave like the planar chain model when the spring constants are large , the behavior of energetic motion of end particles can not be reproduced by applying equilibrium statistical mechanics to the model",
    ".    then it would be interesting to know whether the large average kinetic energies of end particles observed in the planar chain model can also be found in the real world or whether it is an artifact observed only in mathematical models and is never observed in the real world .",
    "if the former is true , then we can expect to observe an interesting feature that the energy distribution of many - body systems shows nonuniform behavior .",
    "since it is natural to consider that the dynamical behavior of a stiff spring is similar to that of a rigid link at least for a finite time , the solution to the problem will be the knowledge of the relaxation properties to equilibrium .    with this background ,",
    "the aim of this study is to examine the property of relaxation to equipartition for the spring - chain system , particularly for a large value of the spring constant @xmath11 .",
    "we measure the relaxation time @xmath13 and investigate its relation with the spring constant @xmath11 .",
    "further , we estimate @xmath13 by the boltzmann - jeans theory and compared it with the value measured .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we introduce the model , the spring - chain system . in sec.iii",
    "we briefly describe the method of numerical computation .",
    "the results are shown in sec.iv .",
    "the final section is devoted to the summary and discussion .",
    "we now introduce the spring - chain system .",
    "it is composed of @xmath0 particles ( masses ) connected by @xmath14 massless springs .",
    "the masses can rotate smoothly on the @xmath15-plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spring - chain ] .",
    "the system is defined by the following lagrangian @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the @xmath5th particle , @xmath19 represents the position of the @xmath5th particle , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the spring constant and natural length of the @xmath5th spring , respectively .",
    "@xmath22 is an external potential . in this paper",
    "we consider the case of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for all @xmath5 .",
    "we set @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the spring - chain model is a kind of beads - type models , which are used as models of polymer and protein  @xcite .",
    "we integrate the equation of motion of the model by a fourth - order symplectic integrator that is the composition of three successive second - order symplectic integrators .",
    "external potential  @xcite @xmath28 is applied in order to break the rotational symmetry and thus prevent the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "here @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .    throughout this paper ,",
    "the following parameters and initial condition are set @xmath36 , @xmath37 for all @xmath5 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 for all @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the values of system size and initial momentum for each simulation set will be defined in the subsequent sections .",
    "next , we briefly summarize the relation between our numerical simulation and thermal equilibrium . under most of the initial conditions considered for the present simulations , the system undergoes chaotic motion .",
    "since the model has no conserved quantities other than the total energy , one may think that the states of the system attained in the course of a long - duration are well approximated by a microcanonical distribution . in that case",
    ", the distribution of the state of each particle in the chain can be approximated by a canonical distribution at a certain temperature , by considering the other particles in the chain as a heat bath . that is , the long - term average of kinetic energy of each particle , @xmath40 , is equal to thermal average @xmath41 .",
    "then , according to the principle of equipartition of energy , the average kinetic energy of each particle is the same : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath46 is the temperature . since our aim is to investigate the property of relaxation to equipartition , we define the following quantity in order to measure how close the system is to equipartition : @xmath47 ^ 2 \\ , .\\ ] ] if @xmath48 , then @xmath49 for all @xmath5 .",

    "the profile is similar to that of the rigid link , i.e. , the planar chain model  @xcite .",
    "then , as time progresses , differences in average @xmath66 among particles gradually decrease and tend to zero , and equipartition is achieved .     for @xmath67 ( blue circles ) , @xmath68 ( red squares ) , @xmath69 ( yellow diamonds ) , and @xmath70 ( green triangles ) .",

    "next , we analyze the results of the abovementioned calculation using the concept of the boltzmann - jeans theory ( also known as boltzmann - jeans conjecture )  @xcite .",
    "the essence of this theory is roughly described as follows .",
    "( for a detailed description of the theory please refer to @xcite . )",
    "suppose we have a system described by a hamiltonian , which has two subsystems @xmath113 and @xmath114 , their typical time scale being @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively . here , subscripts @xmath117 and @xmath118 denote `` fast '' and `` slow , '' respectively .",
    "let us call @xmath113 and @xmath114 as a `` fast subsystem '' and `` slow subsystem , '' respectively .",

    "( [ eq : spring - chain ] ) ] with a large spring constant @xmath11 , the fast and slow subsystems correspond to bond vibration and relative rotation , respectively .",
    "since the typical timescale of bond vibration is on the order of @xmath121 and that of rotation is assumed to be constant , we have @xmath122 since the relaxation to equipartition occurs by energy transfer from rotation to vibration ( as we observed before ) , we can consider that @xmath123 mentioned above is essentially the same as the relaxation time @xmath13 : @xmath124    now , we examine whether @xmath13 obtained by the simulation obeys eq .",
    "( [ eq : timescale - relax ] ) . the result is already shown in fig .  [ fig : log - trelax - vs - sqrt - k ] .",
    "@xmath125 is proportional to @xmath126 ; therefore the interpretation by the boltzmann - jeans theory is appropriate .",
    "this theory can also be used for interpreting the histogram of @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath13 is defined from the average of a number of samples , we have @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the distribution of @xmath92 . if we adopt the exponential form for the distribution @xmath129  [ eq .  ( [ eq : hist - exp ] ) ] , then @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the coefficient that appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hist - exp ] ) .    combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : timescale - relax ] ) and ( [ eq : t - relax - alpha ] ) , the relation between the coefficient @xmath131 and the spring constant should be @xmath132    a comparison between the estimation  [ eq .",

    "vs @xmath11 , obtained from 300 samples .",
    "the dashed line shows @xmath133 , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 . ]",
    "thus , the fact that relaxation to equilibrium takes quite a long time to occur can be interpreted as the outcome of the boltzmann - jeans theory .",
    "in this paper , we have numerically shown the occurrence of energetic motion of end particles for a 1d chain of point masses connected by hard springs .",
    "the timescale at which the energetic motion is observed depends on the spring constant , and this timescale lengthens with increasing the spring constant .",
    "relaxation to equilibrium occurs as rotational kinetic energy is converted into vibrational kinetic energy .",
    "the timescale of relaxation is estimated using the boltzmann - jeans theory , which describes the energy exchange rate in a system in which fast and slow motions coexist . in the case of our model",
    ", fast motion corresponds to bond vibration by a hard spring and slow motion corresponds to rotation and deformation of the chain .",
    "the result of our numerics is that the timescale is estimated as an exponential of the square root of the spring constant , which coincides well with simulation data .",
    "the energetic motion of end particles is also observed in other systems , e.g. , a planar chain system  @xcite and multiple pendulum  @xcite .",
    "these systems consist of masses connected by rigid links , and therefore , they are constrained systems .",
    "if we consider a rigid link as a limiting case of a hard spring when the spring constant @xmath11 is large ( @xmath136 ) , then the spring - chain system examined in this study becomes a planar chain system when @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , it is natural that the spatial energy distribution of the spring - chain system considered in this study resembles those of systems with rigid links .",
    "however , the equilibrium behaviors of spring - chain system and rigid - link chain system are quite different . in the spring - chain system ,",
    "equipartition achieved is of the usual form ; that is , the average kinetic energy of each particle is the same , regardless of the magnitude of @xmath11 .",
    "then , chain - end particles in thermal equilibrium should not exhibit the energetic behavior .",
    "in contrast , in the rigid - link - chain system , chain - end particles behave energetically even in thermal equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the energetic behavior of end particles in the spring - chain system is a transient behavior before the system relaxes to thermal equilibrium .",
    "what is important here is that the relaxation time increases with increasing the spring constant @xmath11 and that the relaxation time eventually diverges at @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , a large @xmath11 value provides a good opportunity to observe energetic behavior in spring - chain systems .",
    "the relaxation time to equipartition changes if we change the initial conditions .",
    "we found that the the relaxation time is distributed according to the exponential form for large relaxation time .",
    "this implies that relaxation occurs almost randomly .",
    "that is , the system moves on the energy surface in a random way and happens to encounter at which the system can divert toward the equipartition state .",
    "this situation is in contrast to the process of slow dynamics often observed in many hamiltonian systems , where the relaxation time is often distributed according to the power law .",
    "slow relaxation is often observed in hamiltonian systems , and in most cases , it is accompanied by strong temporal correlation caused by sticky or stagnant motion around kam tori ( regular orbits ) and their remnants and @xmath139-type fluctuations . such slow relaxation is observed in area - preserving mappings and some other high - dimensional systems  @xcite . such slow relaxation is explained by a hierarchical structure generally found in nearly integrable hamiltonian systems . in this sense , it is quite common to find slow relaxation in hamiltonian systems , if the hamiltonian is nearly integrable .    however , the spring - chain model considered in this study is not nearly integrable .",
    "in addition , the systems which show slow relaxation in real world are not always nearly integrable .",
    "in contrast , the boltzmann - jeans theory is still applicable to hamiltonian systems that are not nearly integrable and is able to explain the slow relaxation .",
    "similar to the research by shudo et al .",
    "@xcite , the result of our study also implies that the boltzmann - jeans theory can describe slow relaxation in more general systems other than the nearly integrable ones .",
    "we used the boltzmann - jeans theory  @xcite to estimate the relaxation time .",
    "although the concept of the theory dates back to the 19th century  @xcite , its importance is not very familiar and not many examples of the application of this theory have been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "because the results of this study show that there is good agreement between numerical data and theoretical estimation , this study can be a good example of the applicability of the boltzmann - jeans theory .",
    "in this study , we showed that chain - end particles behave energetically even for systems with a finite but large spring constant .",
    "this implies that similar behavior can be observed for natural chain - type systems that are not made of rigid links but whose intrachain potential between elements is very steep .",
    "the results of this study are expected to have many useful applications to polymers , proteins and some artificial objects ."
