    "semiconductor lasers are by far the commonest lasers that one finds around nowadays . however , despite being such a common device , they are still actively researched , modified and improved .",
    "they can be used for quantum communication / informatics , in particular , for generating non - classical states of radiation . since the pioneering prediction by golubev and sokolov @xcite ( and it was a quickly confirmed prediction @xcite )",
    ", it is well known that a semiconductor laser driven by a regular low - noise current is able to produce photon - number squeezed states of light .",
    "one should have equal amounts of emitters of the active media pumped in equal intervals of time , so the emitted photons tend to be antibunched .    here",
    "we demonstrate that the photocurrent noise suppression below the standard quantum limit ( which is usually associated with photon - number squeezing ) in semiconductor lasers ( namely , in vecsel lasers ) can be reached by an entirely different mechanism .",
    "namely , it can occur due to coupling of two modes to the same emitter with quickly decaying populations and polarization ( which we shall term here as `` correlated loss '' ) . and for this kind of noise reduction to appear , the regularity of the pump might be practically irrelevant .",
    "it is well - known that coupling to the same emitter induces correlations between field reservoirs @xcite . also , correlated losses are quite common in situations , where one has two or more systems ( in our case , field modes ) coupled to the third lossy system .",
    "interference arising in this case was shown to lead to entanglement between modes even in absence of direct interaction between them .",
    "correlated loss can lead to appearance of nonlinear coupling between modes and even to nonlinear loss producing nearly ideal fock states .",
    "notice , that to have a correlated loss with all consequent nonlinear effects arising , one generally needs to have an hierarchy of time - scales present in the system .",
    "dynamics of the modes should occur on much slower time - scale than dynamics of the dissipating systems coupled to these modes .    here",
    "we demonstrate that in the system of two coupled vertical external cavity surface emitting lasers ( vecsels ) with a common pump , a correlated loss can arise and lead to appearance of photocurrent noise reduction below the standard quantum limit ( sql ) .",
    "it occurs when this systems acts as a class - a laser , and the population inversion lifetime is much shorter , than the photon lifetimes in both modes . since lasing emitters of the active media",
    "are coupled simultaneously to both modes , quick decaying emitters disentangle from them giving rise to effective non - linear coupling between modes ( similarly to as dispersive atom - field produces kerr nonlinearity in eit media ) .",
    "excited emitters of the active media emit either in one or other mode without possibility to re - absorb emitted photon .",
    "such an interference of emission channels gives rise to strong anti - correlation between modes .",
    "it was already demonstrated that vecsels can be class - a lasers .",
    "moreover , a scheme with coupled vecsels generating two output linearly polarized modes of slightly different frequencies was recently realized in experiment and demonstrated as class - a laser @xcite .",
    "this scheme we adopt as a basis for our theoretical model .",
    "we predict that in the set - up similar to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite , noise reduction below sql might occur for each individual mode .",
    "also anticorrelation between modes can arise even for the poissonian pumping ( for example , with the active region excited by an external laser beam ) .",
    "however , our results are not limited to this particular scheme , and can be easily generalized to any kin of lasing devices with correlated loss .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the second section",
    "we introduce the model of two coupled vecsel systems , write down quantum langevin equations for them , discuss parameters of the scheme and describe how the correlated loss and nonlinearities can arise with the example of the simplified particular case of the scheme . in the third section",
    "we derive equations for collective variables ( polarizations and populations ) and discuss a way to describe pump statistics taking into account partition noise . in section",
    "iv we consider quasiclassical equations and demonstrate , that equations for modal amplitudes can be reduced to equations for a - class lasers . in section v we investigate statistics of small fluctuations around stationary values of modal amplitudes , collective populations and polarizations , and discuss the obtained results .",
    "now let us consider a quantum model of two - frequency vecsel in the configuration described in the paper @xcite .",
    "there two coupled vecsels were created by using two - modal external cavity with spatially separated modes .",
    "spatial separation of modes was achieved by introducing a birefringent crystal inside the laser cavity .",
    "modes overlap on the surface of the active media ( which is rather thin for vecsel lasers ) , and the pumped region encompasses all the surface .",
    "a schematic arrangement of the active media regions participating in the generation process can be seen in fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "considering our vecsel model , we use already well established four - level spin - flip model for the description of emitters of the active media @xcite . for the single - frequency vecsel",
    "the quantum theory was already extensively developed and elaborated on the basis of langevin equation formalism .",
    "the model was shown to give quite accurate description of vecsels lasing and to represent adequately a complicated polarization dynamics appearing in this kind of lasers .",
    "each individual emitter / charge carrier of the active semiconductor in this model is described by a four - level system ( actually , two two - level subsystems coupled by spin - flip interaction ) . lower levels of this model correspond to the unexcited states of the semiconductor medium , i.e. without electron - hole pairs .",
    "upper levels correspond to the excited states with electron - hole pairs .",
    "two two - level subsystems are taken to represent states with different ( and opposite ) angular momenta .",
    "we assume that each two - level subsystem is coupled to the single circularly polarized mode with a direction of polarization corresponding to the angular momentum of the state , i.e. if one of the two - level subsystems is coupled to the right - polarized mode , than the other subsystem is coupled to the left - polarized one .",
    "the scheme of levels of the medium is depicted in fig.[fig1](b ) .",
    "now we proceed writing down a system of quantum langevin equations for the interaction of the field with individual emitters along the lines indicated in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us introduce bosonic annihilation operators , @xmath0 , @xmath1 corresponding to circularly polarized ( in opposite directions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) modes of groups `` a '' and `` b '' . then , for these modal operators we have the following system of equations @xcite : @xmath4 where operators @xmath5 denote transition operators from the upper to lower level of the @xmath6th emitter for corresponding circular polarizations . using notations of the state vectors corresponding to the emitter levels given in fig.[fig1 ]",
    ", one writes @xmath7 with @xmath8 being its hermitian conjugate .",
    "quantities @xmath9 are decay rates for modes @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the linear dichroism is present , so , modes of different linear polarization decay with different rates .",
    "this difference is represented by parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "quantities @xmath13 are the emitter - field interaction constants for corresponding modes with frequencies @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent coupling between modes of different circular polarization appearing due to linear birefringence .    for the model we adopt the simple injection - type pumping : an excited emitter ( electron in the active zone and the hole in the valent zone ) appears at a random time - moment .",
    "step - functions @xmath18 are describing such a process of driving the active media .",
    "so , the function @xmath18 describes switching on the interaction of the field with the @xmath19th emitter of the @xmath20th region .",
    "statistics of time moments , @xmath21 , defines the type of the pumping ( regular , poissonian or else ; for the details see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "operators @xmath22 represent quantum langevin forces introduced into equations to account for quantum noises ( in particular , to preserve correct commutation relation for modal operators ) .",
    "they are introduced in the standard manner ( see , for example , a brilliant review by luiz davidovich @xcite ) .",
    "we shall specify their properties later .",
    "now let us proceed with equations for single - emitter transition operators for different active regions depicted in fig.[fig1 ] : @xmath23 here the parameter @xmath24 is the dephasing rate of two - level subsystems of the emitter ; @xmath25 is the transition frequency .",
    "operators @xmath26 describe population of @xmath27th level of @xmath6th emitter of the @xmath20th region : @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "operators @xmath30 represent the corresponding langevin forces ; these operators are independent .",
    "we discuss them in the next subsection .",
    "finally , let us write down equations for single - emitter operators describing populations .",
    "for upper levels these are @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the decay rate of the emitter s upper levels ; @xmath33 is the rate of spin - flips between levels @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "operators @xmath36 represent corresponding langevin forces .",
    "equations for populations of lower levels are as follows : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the decay rate of the emitter s lower levels ; operators @xmath39 represent corresponding langevin forces .",
    "notice , that we are assuming no spin - flips between lower levels of emitters .",
    "it is really unimportant for the considered scheme because the decay rate of lower levels , @xmath38 , is taken to be far exceeding that of upper levels , @xmath32 .",
    "here we describe langevin forces in eqs .",
    "( [ field single],[polarization single],[upper population single],[lower population single ] ) .",

    "so , @xmath45 are c - number functions . however , they do generally depend on stochastic variables , namely , emitter arrival times . first - order averages of langevine forces are zero : @xmath46 .",
    "then , we assume that langevin forces for different emitters of different regions are independent quantum variables , so , for any two forces corresponding to variables of different emitters , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , one has @xmath50 .",

    "we consider realistic values of parameters of the scheme outlined above in this section .",
    "they are close to those of the experiment described in ref .",
    "for these values the scheme acts as a class - a laser .",
    "first of all , we assume that the lower levels of emitters are emptied very rapidly , i.e. @xmath38 is sufficiently large to exclude adiabatically the lower level populations . actually , rapid decay of lower level populations is a condition of this model applicability for semiconductor lasers ; see , for example , ref.@xcite .",
    "then , we make a realistic assumption about dephasing in the active media being very rapid , so the decay rate , @xmath24 , far exceeds the upper levels decay rate , @xmath32 .",
    "finally , we make an assumption of the class - a laser : we take upper level decay rate to be far exceeding modal decay rates , @xmath9 and @xmath58 .",
    "so , the following hierarchy for the time - scales takes place in our model : @xmath59 also , we assume that the interaction constants @xmath13 are small in comparison with the the upper levels decay rate , @xmath32 .",
    "now let us demonstrate that satisfying the condition ( [ hierarchy ] ) , one can get a nonlinear coupling between modes . for illustration",
    "we take the simplified model of just two field modes of the same frequency coupled resonantly to a single two - level system subjected to strong dephasing and population loss .",
    "we describe this simplified model with the following master equation for the density matrix , @xmath60 , written in the basis rotated with the emitters transition frequency @xmath61+\\\\ ( \\gamma_{\\bot}\\mathcal{l}(\\sigma_z ) + \\gamma_{2}\\mathcal{l}(\\sigma^-))\\rho ,   \\label{model master equation1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dissipator @xmath62 .",

    "so , modes become correlated even in the absence of direct coupling between them as the result of strong decay of the emitters coupled to the modes .",
    "moreover , under conditions leading to the dispersive coupling similar to eq.([model master equation2 ] ) , kerr nonlinearities can arise , too . indeed , adiabatically eliminating emitter variables from eq .",
    "( [ model master equation1 ] ) while retaining terms up to @xmath68 and averaging over the state of emitter , it is not hard to obtain for the reduced density matrix the following expression @xmath69- 4i\\frac{g^4}{\\gamma_{\\bot}^3}[\\hat{n}^2 , \\hat{\\rho}].\\label{model master equation3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , one has both linear and cross - kerr coupling between the modes . provided that modal losses are sufficiently low , self - kerr and cross - kerr nonlinearities appearing in eq.([model master equation3 ] ) are known to be able to lead both to photon number squeezing of individual modes and to anticorrelations of modes . as it will be seen below",
    ", it is just the case for our class - a coupled vecsels lasers .",
    "the next step is to move from single - emitter equations to equations for collective operators describing ensembles of emitters in different regions of active media .",
    "such collective operators can be introduced in a standard manner ( see , for example , refs . ) .",
    "so , introducing for clarity different notations for different regions , we obtain for polarizations @xmath70 for collective population operators we have @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the emitter level .    in this section",
    "we derive equations for collective variables ( [ collective operators_p],[collective operators_n ] ) , perform averaging over arrival times of emitters via injection - like pumping and calculate quantum langevin forces corresponding to the introduced collective operators .",
    "first of all , let us write equations for modal operators . from the system ( [ field single ]",
    ") one has @xmath73 as follows from eqs.([polarization single],[collective operators_p],[collective operators_n ] ) , equations for collective polarization operators are @xmath74 collective langevin operators for these equations are @xmath75 correlation properties for these operators will be given in the next subsection .",
    "equations for collective populations are not so trivial to derive as those given above .",
    "( [ field collective],[polarization collective ] ) remain invariant after averaging over arrival times ( of course , it holds , if one assumes that operators in these equations are not correlated through it ; such an assumption is obviously valid near the stationary regime that we are mostly interested in ; see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is not so for equations describing collective populations , since the noise for populations is biased ( has non - zero average ) due to presence of the pump .",
    "we assume that emitters arrive fully excited , and become with equal probability either @xmath2 or @xmath3 excited subsystem of each vecsel .",
    "let us for the time being denote these biases for the upper - level population collective noises as @xmath76 , @xmath20 , denoting regions as in fig.[fig1 ] . as follows from eqs.([upper population single],[collective operators_p],[collective operators_n ] ) , equations for operators of total upper - state populations are @xmath77 in the system ( [ upper level population collective ] ) the collective langevin operators are @xmath78 from the equation ( [ langevin upper state population collective ] ) it is clear that parameters @xmath79 are average pump rates ( i.e. emitter injection rates ) of emitters of the certain type ( i.e. @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) in corresponding regions .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that with our way of driving one has ( see the derivation in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath80 where @xmath81 denoted averaging over the arrival times .    in our scheme of two - frequency vecsel",
    "the pumping source for all three regions is the same @xcite .",
    "so , respective pump rates are not independent parameters .",
    "since we are assuming that density of emitters is the same in all considered regions , the average pump rate for every region is simply proportional to the size of this region .",
    "thus , we write @xmath82 where parameters @xmath83 describe the respective sizes of the regions of modal overlap , @xmath84 , relative to total sizes of regions interacting with modes `` a '' and `` b '' .    finally , we write down equations for lower level collective populations deriving them from eqs.([lower population single ] ) . notice that emitters are taken to be injected being completely excited , i.e. they are on upper levels .",
    "thus , we have @xmath85 in this system the collective langevin operators are @xmath86    it should be pointed out that statistics of arriving times , @xmath87 is defined by the character of the driving process and might influence states of the emitted modes .",
    "this statistics affects correlation properties of langevin operators , which are to be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "notwithstanding the fact that collective variables are composed only from emitter operators of the same region , operators of collective langevin forces for different regions are not independent and their cross - correlations are not always zero .",
    "it occurs because of the presence of the same driving source for all three regions .",
    "naturally , such a driving partition can give rise to cross - region correlations .",
    "here we consider them generalizing a simple and illustrative procedure described in details in ref.@xcite .",
    "using it , one obtains that @xmath88 where the parameter @xmath89 describes the regularity of the pump and @xmath90 .",
    "the value @xmath91 corresponds to the poissonian pump ( for example , as it is for pumping the active region with the external laser field in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the value @xmath92 corresponds to the regular pump when emitters arrive to the active region with a constant rate .",
    "however , even in this case either `` + '' or `` - '' subsystems are excited with equal probability ; that is the reason of having @xmath93 instead of @xmath89 in eq.([correlation langevin upper state population collective ] ) .",
    "values @xmath94 correspond to partially regular pumping .",
    "one can see from eq.([correlation langevin upper state population collective ] ) that for poissonian pump noise correlations between region do not arise , whereas for regular pumping one has cross - region correlations . as we shall see below",
    ", such a partition noise negates a noise - suppression effect of the regular pump .",
    "photon number squeezing in our two coupled vecsels scheme arise solely due to effect of the correlated loss , i.e. due to interference of emission channels .",
    "thus , from eqs.([langevin upper state population collective ] ) it is possible to get second - order correlation functions of the collective langevin forces for collective upper - state populations . for non - zero correlation functions of the same regions one",
    "has @xmath95 where @xmath96 , and , simultaneously , @xmath97 . for cross - correlation functions of different regions one has @xmath98 where @xmath99 , and , simultaneously , @xmath100 .",
    "variables without `` hats '' denote averages of corresponding quantum variables , i.e. @xmath101 , and averaging is assumed to be done over the distribution of arrival times , too .",
    "since the emitters arrive completely excited , non - zero second - order correlation functions of the collective langevin forces for collective lower - state populations are simpler than eqs .",

    "we assume also that the frequency difference between surviving modes , @xmath110 , is very small on the scale set by other parameters of the problem .",

    "first of all , notice that spectra of photocurrent fluctuations of output modes @xmath51 and @xmath52 are drastically different ( notwithstanding the fact that for the chosen symmetric case the stationary values of modal intensities are the same ) .",
    "an explanation for this phenomenon can be guessed even from the toy model described in subsection [ simple model ] : from eq .",
    "( [ model master equation3 ] ) one can see that the symmetric modal superposition is subjected to nonlinearity , whereas the antisymmetric is not .",
    "so , for orthogonally polarized modes one should expect different noises .",
    "then , it can be seen that spectral properties of fluctuations are strongly dependent on the overlap between active regions of vecsels .",
    "it is possible to distinguish three different regimes of fluctuations in dependence on the overlap : the strong ( approximately @xmath167 ) , intermediate ( @xmath168 ) and weak ( @xmath169 ) overlap .",
    "let us start with the discussion of noise features common for all three regimes . in fig.[fig2](a )",
    "it is shown how the photocurrent noise of the output mode @xmath51 for fixed overlap is suppressed more with increase of the pumping rate .",
    "quite significant suppression of the photocurrent noise can be reached ( say , about @xmath170 )",
    ". however , with the used values of parameters ( chosen to make the system operating as a class - a laser ) one quickly comes out of the region of applicability of the approximation used to derive the system ( [ system for small fluctuation time domain ] ) .",
    "this feature was commented upon in the previous section .",
    "so , for the pumping rate exceeding the threshold value ( [ driving rates threshold values ] ) only by @xmath171 the condition ( [ small field amplitudes condition ] ) is already breaking down .",
    "it is remarkable that regularity of the pump can even diminish noise reduction for the case ( which is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "the reason for this is simple : the common pump for both coupled vecsel systems induces rather strong partition noise .",
    "it obliterates the effect of regularity .",
    "whereas for the coherent poissonian pumping partition noise is not present . also , it is worth noting that the harmful influence of regularity is more pronounced with increase of the pumping rate , since the terms describing the partition noise grow linearly with the pumping rate ( see eq.([correlation langevin upper state population collective1 ] ) .",
    "the photocurrent fluctuation spectrum for the mode @xmath52 depends on the pumping rate in the same way as it is for the mode @xmath51 for the fixed value of the overlap ( fig.[fig2](b ) ) .",
    "another feature common for all three regimes is dependence of the exhibited noise suppression on respective modal losses .",
    "it should be stressed out that for any significant suppression of the photocurrent noise to appear one needs having rather good cavity for their vecsels .",
    "when one goes far away from this limit , noise reduction degrades significantly ( fig.[fig2](d ) and fig.[fig3](d ) ) . for the coupling constant , @xmath172",
    ", just two orders of magnitude lower than the modal loss rate , @xmath173 , any noise suppression is already absent .",
    "this result is rather expected , since strong modal loss is bound to destroy quickly interference effects leading to non - classicality ( which is well - known fact for those trying to produce non - classical states with kerr - type nonlinearity ) .",
    "now let us discuss the dependence of photocurrent noise spectra on the overlap between regions of the active media .",
    "fig.[fig2](c ) and fig.[fig3](c ) show that the mechanism of photocurrent noise suppression for the case is indeed the correlated loss . in the regime of weak",
    "overlap ( taking place approximately for @xmath174 ) for both output modes suppression is absent . in this regime",
    "the system behaves as two nearly uncoupled vecsels with coherent pumping and exhibits weak bunched noise diminishing with increase of the frequency ( which is typical for the individual single - mode class - a vecsels considered here ) .    in the regime of the strong overlap ( approximately @xmath167 ) ,",
    "the output mode @xmath51 shows much larger noise suppression than the mode @xmath52 ( which is a manifestation of noise dependence on the modal polarization mentioned earlier ) .",
    "when the overlap becomes smaller , noise for the mode @xmath51 and @xmath52 behaves in the opposite way .",
    "noise decreases for the mode @xmath51 and increases for the mode @xmath52 ( see fig.[fig2](b ) and fig.[fig3](b ) ) .",
    "an increase of noise suppression for the mode @xmath52 continues well into the intermediate regime , @xmath175 , reaching the maximum when approximately half of the active media regions overlap . whereas in this regime noise reduction for the mode",
    "@xmath51 is rather weak .",
    "since our non - classical noise suppression effect is produced by the interference of the emission channels of emitters arriving to the active media , i.e. by coupling of modes to the same emitters subjected to strong losses , it is naturally to expect a strong intermodal correlation arising as the result of this process ( as it is pointed out by the simple model considered in subsection [ simple model ] , where it is demonstrated how the coupling between the modes arises for this case ) . due to different behavior of the photocurrent fluctuation spectra for modes @xmath51 and @xmath52 one expects having rather non - trivial cross - correlation spectrum ( [ photocurrent cross correlation spectrum ] ) .",
    "having nearly poissonian noise of the mode @xmath52 and strongly suppressed photocurrent noise of the mode @xmath51 in the larger overlap regime , it is quite intuitive to see anticorrelations between modes in this regime ( fig.[fig4](a , b ) ) .",
    "also , it is not surprising to have these anticorrelations diminishing with decrease of the pumping rate or emitter - field interaction constants for the fixed overlap ( see fig.[fig4](a ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "however , notice that the maximum anticorrelation for the large overlap is reached for small frequency regions where the photocurrent fluctuations spectra for both modes are actually super - poissonian ( fig.[fig4](a ) ) .",
    "this is also a manifestation of the correlated loss as an interference of the emission channels for emitters arriving to the active medium .",
    "an individual emitter emits a photon either to one mode or another , and due to a large population and polarization losses the probability to have the photon re - absorbed by the emitter is very low .",
    "this process might not prevent noises of individual modes from exhibiting bunching , but it induces anticorrelations between modes .",
    "maximal anticorrelation is reached in the intermediate regime where the photocurrent spectrum of the mode @xmath52 exhibit maximal noise reduction . with further decrease of the overlap anticorrelations",
    "are eventually washed out tending to small positive correlations in the small overlap regime ( fig.[fig4](c ) ) . notice",
    "that maximal increase of the anticorrelations has obviously resonant character depending strongly on the overlap and the frequency ; the maximum anticorrelation is reached for the overlap corresponding approximately to all three regions @xmath176 being equally sized ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "it should be noticed that correlations between modes are even more sensitive to modal losses than non - classicality of individual modes ( see fig.[fig4](d ) ) .",
    "as it should be expected , modal losses into independent additional dissipative reservoir are prone to obliterate quickly the effect of the correlated loss ( i.e. coupling to the same reservoir ) @xcite .",
    "one should really be not far from the good cavity limit to have significant correlations between modes in two coupled vecsels considered here .",
    "in this work we have demonstrated that the system of two coupled vecsels can indeed be a class - a laser , if it is sufficiently close to the threshold .",
    "we have developed a simple model based on the quantum langevin equations that leads to the semiclassical equations for the intensities of two surviving orthogonally linearly polarized output modes similar to the equations describing the class - a laser .",
    "we have demonstrated that both suppression of photocurrent fluctuation noise below the standard quantum limit and strongly negative cross - correlation ( anticorrelation ) are possible in the system .",
    "it is remarkable that the mechanism of noise suppression arising in this case is quite different from the already well - known mechanism of inducing noise suppression through the regular pumping . in our case",
    "non - classicality arises through correlated loss , i.e. due to simultaneous coupling of both modes to the same emitter and quick decay of populations and polarization of this emitter .",
    "it is demonstrated by disappearance of non - classicality for small overlap between active regions of vecsels , when the dynamics of each vescel is essentially as for an individual independent laser .",
    "for both strong and moderate overlap it is possible to reach quite strong suppression of photocurrent fluctuations ( 5 - 10 db ) and large anti - correlations .",
    "notice , that regularity of the pumping does not enhance non - classicality available with coherent pumping .",
    "actually , as a consequence of partition noise arising due to the pump being common for both vecsels , regularity of the pumping can actually be harmful for non - classicality .",
