    "the notion that the fundamental structure of spacetime might be something other than a continuum has been around for many decades .",
    "a particular type of modified spacetime structure , which in modern parlance has come to be known as non - commutative geometry , had in fact been studied as far back as the 1940 s @xcite .",
    "recent developments in string theory suggest that this modification to geometry at high energy scales can arise in certain d - brane backgrounds with a non - trivial rr flux , resulting in a resurgence of interest in the phenomenological consequences of physics on non - commutative spaces .",
    "the basic idea of non - commutative geometry is rather simple : instead of considering spacetime coordinates @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 ) to be described by c - number functions on some manifold , we consider our spacetime coordinates to satisfy some sort of structure relations @xmath2 = i o^{\\mu\\nu},}\\ ] ] where the @xmath3 are hermitian operators , and @xmath4 is a hermitean operator antisymmetric in its indices .",
    "several widely studied examples include the type of non - commutativity first introduced in @xcite @xmath5 = i i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu},}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the identity operator and @xmath7 is a non - degenerate antisymmetric tensor , and @xmath8 = i\\kappa \\epsilon_{ijk}\\hat x^k,}\\ ] ] ( with @xmath9 denoting spatial components ) where @xmath10 has dimensions of length , and corresponds to the scale of non - commutativity .",
    "both examples arise in string theory when describing d - brane dynamics in non - trivial flux backgrounds @xcite . in this report",
    ", we focus on the former relation ( [ ncg ] ) , and explore its consequences for inflationary cosmology , where we will find that we can tightly constrain the amount of spacetime non - commutativity present during inflation .    the initial intuition that motivated this study , was that the uv / ir mode mixing present in theories such as those defined on non - commutative ( moyal ) spaces defined by  ( [ ncg ] ) , could provide us a constraining lever on physics at high energy scales complimentary to the lever offered by the effect of modes being stretched by inflation .",
    "what we find is that the presence of this effect present in this example is so severe as to already be ruled out by present observations ( if it had nt already been severely constrained for other reasons  @xcite ) . in this sense",
    ", the spirit in which we undertake this study is that of a first pass ( within a concrete and widely studied context ) , on the notion that uv / ir mode mixing may offer us a complimentary lever on very high energy physics in the cmb , which in this example , is used to rule out a class of modifications to space time structure at such energy scales .",
    "we begin by reviewing those aspects of non - commutative field theory relevant for our study , after which we will consider inflation in the presence of background non - commutativity . after showing that the background inflaton dynamics are identical for the commutative vs the noncommutative cases ( in the event that non - commutativity is purely spatial ) , we derive the action for the scalar perturbations , where we find that loop effects render a non - local effective action .",
    "we show that the net effect of spatial non - commutativity is to modify the dispersion relations for the propagation of the perturbations , such that mode propagation differs from the usual case for all wavelengths _ less _ than the critical wavelength @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the non - commutativity length scale , and @xmath13 is the slow roll parameter .",
    "we see that uv / ir mode mixing induced by loop effects communicates signatures of non - commutativty to scales far below the no n - commutativity scale independent of whether or not the theta tensor redshifts during inflation .",
    "we will then compute the two point correlation functions for the metric fluctuations , and find that the presence of any amount of spatial non - commutativity to be inconsistent with the observed cmb spectrum .",
    "in what follows , we offer a brief overview of those aspects of non - commutative field theory relevant for our investigation . we refer to the excellent review of ref .",

    "once we assume the structure relations @xmath14 = i i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] for our spacetime coordinates , we find that the net effect of spacetime non - commutativity is to deform the usual product on our manifold to the so - called star product , defined by @xmath15 for readers unfamiliar with this aspect of non - commutative physics , we offer a quick review of why this is so in appendix [ app - a ] .",
    "field theories on non - commutative spaces can be defined in the usual way , except that now all products in the action are to be replaced with star products @xmath16,}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 indicates that all fields are multiplied with star products .",
    "it is a property of the star product that the quadratic part of any action remains unaffected @xmath18 as is easily checked by fourier expanding @xmath19 and @xmath20 and performing the spacetime integral .",
    "therefore the quadratic part of the action is unaffected by the underlying non - commutative structure .",
    "in particular , this means that the green s functions for the commutative and the non - commutative theories are identical , and suffer from the same short distance divergences @xcite .",
    "consider now the @xmath21 theory in four dimensions : @xmath22.}\\ ] ] as we see immediately , the underlying non - commutative structure affects only the interaction terms . working in fourier space , it is straightforward to show that the net effect of non - commutativity on the interaction vertices is to introduce an additional phase factor relative to the commutative case @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath25 momentum flowing into the vertex , and we employ the shorthand notation : @xmath26 one should note that @xmath27 is not invariant under arbitrary permutations of the @xmath24 , but only cyclic permutations .",
    "this results in a relative phase factor between the two one loop self energy diagrams shown in fig .  1 .",
    "these two diagrams make the 1-loop 1pi two point function to differ by a phase of the form @xcite @xmath28 where they would have yielded identical contributions in the commutative case ( up to symmetry factors ) . following the treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite , we observe that non - commutativity appears to regulate the non - planar sector of the theory ( through the oscillating phase factor ) , whilst leaving the planar sector unaffected . in order to see the effects of this phase factor",
    ", we use the schwinger reparameterization of the propagator @xmath29 which renders the loop momentum integrations gaussian .",
    "we can evaluate these straight away to yield @xmath30 where we adopt the notation : @xmath31 regulating the small @xmath32 divergence with the cut - off @xmath33 $ ] yields @xmath34 from which we can immediately read that if @xmath35 is the momentum cut - off for the planar sector , then the non - planar sector has a cut - off : @xmath36 in the event that not all coordinates are non - commutative , @xmath37 is to be understood as being only constructed out of the non - commutative components of the 4 momenta .",
    "we evaluate the contributions to the one loop effective actions as : @xmath38 we note from the form of eq .",
    "( [ effc ] ) that in the limit @xmath39 , the non - planar contribution to the effective action diverges in the limit @xmath40 .",
    "that is to say , the non - planar sector appears to inherit an ir divergence at low momenta from the uv divergence of the planar sector . in momentum space ,",
    "the resulting effective action from the contributions of all self energy graphs is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the renormalized mass given by : @xmath43 thus we see from eq .",
    "( [ 1lea ] ) , that loop effects can communicate even high scale non - commutativity to large wavelengths , as is evidenced by the non - local term proportional to the self coupling , which becomes significant for low momenta .",
    "we take note of a similar effect for @xmath44 theory in 4-d .",
    "if we denote the ( now dimensionful ) coupling constant as @xmath20 , we see from fig .  2 that again there is a planar and a non - planar sector to the one loop self energy .",
    "it follows for similar reasons that the planar and the non - planar sectors contribute differently to the one loop effective actions and yield @xcite @xmath45 where now , unlike the case of @xmath21 theory , the leading singular term at low momenta for the one loop effective action for @xmath44 theory is only logarithmically divergent .",
    "we note in passing that although the ir divergent terms in the low energy effective action were derived in the context of imposing a cut - off regularization and sending this cut - off to infinity , the ir divergence derived above are to be taken to be as generic features of theories which exhibit strong uv / ir mixing .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it was shown in the context of @xmath21 theory that quadratic ir divergences result independent of the scale of the cut - off @xmath35 .    in the next section ,",
    "we investigate the consequences of such loop effects ( uv / ir mixing ) for inflation in the presence of any underlying non - commutativity , and compute two point functions for the scalar fluctuations .",
    "we now commence our analysis of the effects of non - commutativity on cmb observables .",

    "the order of non - commutative effects comes determined by the size of the lengthscale @xmath65 , entering the non - commutative structure tensor @xmath66 .",
    "it is rather clear that the validity of slow - roll inflationary framework in a non - commutative background requires us to have l _ h 1 , [ cond - desitter ] which simply means that the de sitter radius @xmath67 determining the size of causally connected regions during inflation has to be much larger than the non - commutative lengthscale @xmath65 .",
    "we also note here that eq .",
    "( [ pertac ] ) is a one loop effective action , which diverges at low momenta ( and where higher loop effects become significant ) , has a domain of validity which does not stretch arbitrarily far into the ir .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , this domain of validity is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is of order unity , and as shown in the appendix , @xmath70 .",
    "for any reasonable model of inflation , both @xmath71 and @xmath61 are smaller than @xmath72 , therefore making the exponent on the right hand side almost vanishing , and certainly all scales of cosmological interest fall within the domain of validity of our approximation .",
    "we now study the evolution of perturbations during inflation in the presence of non - commutativity , and its consequences for the spectrum of scalar fluctuations . in what follows ,",

    "that this choice breaks isotropy is inevitable . in @xcite the consequences of this preferred direction for the cmb was explored , and in @xcite , its consequences for non - gaussian imprints in the cmb were considered .",
    "we wish to show in this report is that if indeed non - commutativity is present , these effects are subsidiary , and are dwarfed by the fact that cmb power is greatly suppressed at long wavelengths by the effects of non - planar uv / ir mixing .",
    "that is , we are not concerned with these aspects of what we view as model specific features .",
    "instead , we are more interested in exploring what we view as a generic consequences of uv / ir mixing in the context of a concrete model , and in doing so , deriving constraints on the presence of non - comutativity before , or during inflation .    to make our analysis as exhaustive as possible , in this report we consider various possible time dependences of the tensor @xmath81 at the right hand side of eq .",

    "supposing , for instance , that the inflaton is a transverse modulus describing the end points of open strings ( d - branes ) in non - trivial @xmath87-field backgrounds , the open string endpoints ( brane coordinates ) will satisfy the moyal type non - commutative structure relations @xcite : @xmath88 where @xmath20 is the string worldsheet metric and @xmath87 is the worldsheet anti - symmetric field ( with dimensions of inverse length squared ) , and @xmath89 denotes anti - symmetrization .",
    "we note that expanding in powers of @xmath90 , to leading order , two factors of the metric will contract @xmath91 , leading to @xmath92 , and thus we see that in the particular case where the background is characterized by a constant @xmath91 field , we recover a constant @xmath85 .",
    "one can imagine , however , a situation in which inflation is being realized as the result of a moving d - brane on a warped background with @xmath91 scaling spatially accordingly . in such a case ,",
    "the effective time variation of @xmath91 on the brane would be such that @xmath93 ( instead of @xmath85 ) remains constant .",

    "notice that we can rewrite the non - commutative relation in terms of _ proper _ coordinates @xmath96 in the following way : = i a^2 ( ) ^ij .",
    "this means that during inflation the proper noncommutative length scale @xmath65 grows with time as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a co - moving length scale . by inserting eq .",
    "( [ theta - case-1 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ mode - eq ] ) we arrive to the following equation of motion : @xmath99 we immediately read off the solutions to this equation , as they only differ from the standard canonically normalized mode functions in their @xmath100 dependence @xmath101 with @xmath102 defined as @xmath103 we take note of the following duality in the above @xmath104 which has a simple interpretation in terms of the scattering of localized @xmath105 wave packets upon self - interaction @xcite .",
    "we can immediately see how this will lead to an unacceptable modification to the cmb spectrum , namely , that any such duality will cause the cmb to be symmetric around the pivot wavelength : @xmath106 note that even in the case of very high scale non - commutativity , even as high as planckian , this pivot wavelength will be below this scale ( for @xmath13 and @xmath107 , this scale becomes the gut scale ) .",
    "any feature of the spectrum at short wavelengths will be exactly mirrored at long wavelengths .",
    "hence , if the normalization of the mode functions vanishes towards the uv , it will also do so in the ir .",
    "this will result in suppression of power at low multipoles , as is easily seen by using standard techniques to compute the resulting power spectrum for curvature perturbations ( defined in appendix [ app - b ] ) @xmath108 which results in the power spectrum : @xmath109 we easily read off that the two point function will start to receive significant corrections _",

    "if non - commutativity were present at some high energy scale before , or during inflation , the resulting spectrum of metric fluctuations would have vanishing power at all observable scales that is , the main feature of inflation that inspires our belief in it would be nullified by non - commutativity and we d have to search elsewhere for the origins of large scale structure .",
    "this ` stiffening ' of long wavelength fluctuations is a well known and widely studied feature of non - commutative field theories ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and we see here that in the context of inflation , would nullify the mechanism with which it generates the primordial fluctutations responsible for large scale structure .    if the reader as doubts at this point that this may be an artifact of the fact that we considered the case where the theta tensor is independent of the metric tensor , in the next section we demonstrate that this stiffening of long wavelength modes is even more severe in the opposite case .",
    "the second case of interest corresponds to the situation in which @xmath80 ( with both upper and lower indices ) is independent of the metric . notice that in this case one has = i g^i k _ k^ j = i a^-2 ( t ) _",
    "i^ j , and therefore the non - commutative relation expressed in _ proper _ coordinates @xmath96 is given by : = i _",
    "i^ j , which means that the proper noncommutative length scale @xmath112 remains constant during the inflationary stage .",
    "if , similarly to the previous case , we write @xmath113 , we are then left with @xmath114 and the equations of motion  ( [ mode - eq ] ) for the mode functions take the form  - + ( k^2 + ) = 0 .",

    "furthermore , we note from ( [ second - case - eq ] ) that the curvature perturbation no longer ceases to evolve after horizon crossing .",
    "instead , it is damped until the end of inflation , after which non - commutative effects are no longer felt and the curvature perturbation proceeds conserved until it re - enters our horizon as imprints on the cmb .",

    "it is important to notice that , as @xmath115 , the momenta of the mode solutions is redshifted until eq .",

    "it is nevertheless clear that these higher order loop effects will not restore the scale invariance of the power spectrum .",

    ". roughly speaking , these modes crossed the horizon about @xmath122 @xmath123-folds before the end of inflation , the precise number depending on the specific model under consideration .",

    "moreover , from eq .",
    "( [ cond - desitter ] ) we see that the inflationary scale had to be well within reach of current observations .",

    "as before , we see that power spectrum deduced from this expression is not only heavily suppressed , but it is heavily dependent on the scales due to the scale dependence posed by @xmath116 .",

    "( [ cond - desitter ] ) must be valid at any time during inflation , and in particular at the epoch @xmath151 where our reference perturbations are crossing the horizon , the previous bound additionally implies @xmath156 .",
    "we therefore conclude that this type of non - commutativity is incompatible with slow - roll inflation as a mechanism to generate the anisotropies presently observed at the cmb .",
    "in addition , in the present case as well , we see from ( [ mfeq2 ] ) that the curvature perturbations continue to be damped after horizon crossing until inflation ends .",

    "( [ spat - non - commutativity ] ) would render any effects of non - commutativity null , we find the effects of uv / ir mode mixing to be _ even more pronounced_. the reason for this is well understood , and comes down to the fact that many features of non - commutative theories are different in the @xmath160 limit than if there was no commutativity to begin with , such as various amplitudes @xcite and the phase structure of the theory @xcite among others .",
    "a rather stark demonstration of this comes from when one considers the beta function for non - commutative qed @xcite , @xmath161 with @xmath162 the number of dirac fermion species .",
    "the new negative term arises from non - commutative photon self interactions , and is independent of @xmath121 , provided non - commutativity exists in the first place . in an analogous manner , we find that even if the theta tensor is being rapidly redshifted , the consequence for the cmb two point function is rather pronounced .",
    "we thus conclude , echoing the sentiment expressed in the preliminaries , that as far as very high energy physics is concerned , the phenomenon of uv / ir mode mixing offers us a complimentary lever ( on high energy physics ) to the effects of inflation blowing up modes .",

    "this map effects the standard prescription of ` putting hats ' on the c - number functions :    @xmath173 when products of @xmath174 occur that are ambiguous , the above map returns the ` weyl ordered ' or totally symmetrized product of operators , hence this mapping is referred to as the weyl correspondence .",

    "that is , any two operators @xmath175 and @xmath176 multiply as @xmath177 .",

    "background quantities do not feel this non - commutativity as it is purely spatial . in the resulting expression",
    ", we would like to extract the terms that contributes to the leading divergence in the ir for the quadratic part of the one loop effective action .",
    "as seen in the preliminaries , non - planar cubic vertices contribute at most logarithmic ir divergences , unless there are derivatives acting on the vertex . to this end , we begin with the first term in the above as it has the most derivatives that could run along a loop ( recalling from ( [ chi ] ) that @xmath198 ) to leading order in @xmath13 ( the only other terms which have as many derivatives are subleading in @xmath13 ) .",
