    "the nearby carbon star irc+10216 ( cw leo , iras 09452 + 1330 ) is surrounded by a dusty , expanding envelope with relatively simple geometry and kinematics that has been the subject of many studies of astrochemical processes .",
    "a rich chemistry develops in the envelope as gas is lost from the star at a high rate ( @xmath3  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 , crosas & menten 1997 ) and is modified by thermodynamic equilibrium and non - equilibrium reactions , photochemical reactions , ion - molecule reactions , and the condensation of dust grains .",
    "the range of physical conditions in the envelope make it especially well suited to observations of rotational emission lines from molecules , and numerous species have been identified in spectral scans at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths ( e.g. cernicharo , guelin & kahane 2000 ; groesbeck , phillips & blake 1994 , avery et al .",
    "1992 ) .    the close proximity ( @xmath6  pc ) and copious mass loss of irc+10216 allows studies of the circumstellar envelope on a wide range of size scales . on the largest scales , an extensive envelope of dust ( mauron & huggins 1999 ) and gas ( fong",
    ", meixner & shah 2003 ) has been found to extend to @xmath7  pc ( @xmath8 ) in radius . on much smaller scales , interferometric imaging at millimeter wavelengths",
    "has revealed the spatial distribution of molecular species within the central arcminute ( e.g. bieging & tafalla 1993 , guelin , lucas & cernicharo 1993 , lucas & guelin 1999 ) .",
    "parent molecules are found to be centrally peaked ( e.g. sis , hcn ) , while daughter molecules are found with shell distributions ( e.g. cn , c@xmath9h , hnc ) .",
    "high angular resolution is especially important for imaging lines of high excitation that emerge from the innermost regions of the envelope , where the temperatures and densities are highest .",
    "since the high excitation rotational lines of many common molecules lie at short submillimeter wavelengths , the submillimeter array ( sma ) opens new possibilities for probing physical conditions and chemistry by enabling imaging observations with arcsecond resolution . in this _",
    "letter _ , we present observations of irc+10216 in cs j=1413 emission made with the partially constructed sma ( ho , moran & lo 2004 ) .",
    "these are the first interferometer images from observations in the atmospheric window centered near 450  @xmath2 m , where @xmath1030% or better transmission occurs at high , dry sites like the summit of mauna kea a significant fraction of the time .",
    "they build on the pioneering efforts of carlstrom et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who obtained fringes on the nearby single baseline between the caltech  submillimeter  observatory and the james  clerk  maxwell  telescope .",
    "the results provide constraints on sulfur chemistry in the inner wind of the irc+10216 prototype carbon - rich circumstellar envelope .",
    "we observed irc+10216 on 10 december 2002 with the sma when three of the 6  meter diameter antennas were equipped with receivers for the `` 600700  ghz '' frequency band .",
    "the weather was very good , with 225  ghz atmospheric opacity of 0.035 measured at the nearby caltech submillimeter observatory through the night , or @xmath11 at the sma observing frequency .",
    "table 1 summarizes the observational parameters .",
    "we adopt the cs j=1413 line rest frequency of 685.435923 ghz , recently calculated from newly determined spectroscopic constants ( gottlieb , myers & thaddeus 2003 ) .",
    "the sma observations provided three independent baselines ranging from 14 to 25 meters in length , resulting in @xmath12 resolution .",
    "a major difficulty for interferometric imaging at these high frequencies is the lack of sufficiently strong sources with known structure for the derivation of complex gains to track instrumental phase drifts and atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "in particular , nearly all of the point - like quasars are too weak for the sma to detect at shorter wavelengths in a few minutes of integration time .",
    "compact thermal sources such as planetary moons or asteroids provide one alternative .",
    "for these observations , we took advantage of the close proximity of jupiter to irc+10216 in the sky ( @xmath13  degrees ) .",
    "while jupiter was far too large to be a suitable calibrator ( diameter @xmath14 ) , the galilean moons were only slightly resolved on these baselines , and high signal - to - noise observations of callisto ( diameter @xmath15 ) could be efficiently interleaved with those of irc+10216 .",
    "jupiter was located well outside the small sma field of view during the observations of callisto , and the data show no evidence for any contamination from the planetary emission .",
    "irc+10216 was tracked over the hour angle range @xmath16h to @xmath17h .",
    "the predicted flux of callisto varied by less than @xmath18% due to resolution effects .",
    "the partially complete digital correlator was configured with four overlapping `` chunks '' , each of 104 mhz bandwidth and 128 channels , with the cs j=1413 line centered in one of them .",
    "a calibration of the bandpass shape was obtained from observations of mars .",
    "the system temperatures ranged from 1200 to 2200 k ( dsb ) .",
    "the absolute flux scale was set assuming a full disk flux of 55  jy for callisto , based on a brightness temperature of 120 k determined by comparison with titan , whose submillimeter spectrum is better known ( mark gurwell , private communication ) .",
    "the overall flux scale is unlikely to be more accurate than 30% .",
    "images were made with a variety of weighting schemes that provided slightly different angular resolutions , sensitivities , and synthesized beam sidelobe patterns .",
    "figure  [ fig : cs_spectrum ] shows the spectrum from the center of the image cube for the full usb correlator band , averaging groups of 8 channels , corresponding to a velocity width of 2.85 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the cs j=1413 line is the prominent feature centered at @xmath19  km  s@xmath5 and an approximate width at zero power of @xmath20  km  s@xmath5 , values which are consistent with the systemic velocity of the source and the expansion velocity of the envelope , respectively .",
    "the line shape is difficult to interpret because spatial filtering by the interferometer results in missing flux that varies with velocity across the profile ( see  [ discussion : line ] ) .",
    "the peak brightness temperature of the line at the full angular resolution of the data is well over 100  k. an additional feature appears in the spectrum near @xmath21  km  s@xmath5 with a double peaked line shape and an approximate width consistent with the circumstellar expansion .",
    "a search of the jpl spectral line catalog suggests a tentative identification of this feature with the c@xmath22h@xmath9 @xmath23 line at 685.6125565  ghz .",
    "this species was previously detected in transitions at lower frequencies ( kawaguchi et al .",
    "1995 , cernicharo et al .",
    "no alternative candidates line were found in the catalog of cernicharo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that contains 1050 molecular species ( cernicharo , private communication ) .",
    "if the assignment is correct , then the line might be thought to emerge from the external shell where various carbon chain radicals are found ( guelin et al .",
    "this feature appears to be spatially compact , though , which perhaps renders the identification problematic .",
    "figure  [ fig : cont ] shows the continuum image obtained from the channels free of strong line emission .",
    "visibilities from both sidebands , separated by 10  ghz , were combined in a multifrequency synthesis , resulting in an effective frequency of 680 ghz .",
    "the continuum peak position is consistent with previous determinations , in particular the 95  ghz observation from the iram pdbi ( guelin et al .",
    "1993 ) , which is marked by the cross .",
    "the peak continuum flux is 3.8  jy , with an uncertainty dominated by systematic effects .",
    "previous bolometer observations of irc+10216 at 450  @xmath2 m indicate that the sma recovers approximately 20% of the broadband flux at this wavelength .",
    "sandell ( 1994 ) noted that irc+10216 has long period variations in the submillimeter and found @xmath24  jy in an @xmath25 aperture near the 635 day maximum .",
    "jenness et al .",
    "( 2002 ) analyzed several years of scuba observations of irc+10216 at 850  @xmath2 m and 450  @xmath2 m and found a period and maximum flux consistent with the earlier single pixel measurements .",
    "the sma observations were made approximately a month before the predicted maximum , when @xmath26 of the peak flux would be expected .",
    "remarkably , the cs j=1413 line emission _",
    "alone _ accounts for @xmath27 of the flux in the @xmath28  ghz wide filter used for the 450  @xmath2 m bolometer measurements .",
    "given the many strong spectral lines excited in the inner envelope at these high frequencies , it is clear that spectral line emission makes an important contribution to the broadband `` continuum '' flux .",
    "a large fraction of the continuum emission from the compact component detected by the sma at 680  ghz likely comes from the stellar photosphere .",
    "lucas & guelin ( 1999 ) report a `` point source '' component in iram pdbi observations of @xmath29  mjy at 89  ghz and @xmath30  mjy at 242  ghz , identified as photospheric emission .",
    "assuming an optically thick spectrum , @xmath31 , an extrapolation to 680  ghz gives 3.8  jy , consistent with the measured value .",
    "thermal emission from dust in the inner envelope can not contribute substantial additional flux in the small synthesized beam of the sma at this high frequency .      figure  [ fig : cs_channels ] shows images for a series of velocity intervals that span the cs j=1413 line .",
    "below each of the images is a plot of visibility amplitude vs. @xmath32 distance for the corresponding velocity interval to give an idea of spatial extent , which is not easy to ascertain from the images .",
    "the overall structure in the visibility amplitudes is consistent with simple expectations for a spherically expanding envelope . at the extreme velocities , the amplitude is approximately constant , as expected for the unresolved `` caps '' of blueshifted and redshifted emission , while at intermediate velocities",
    ", the fall - off of visibility amplitude with @xmath32 distance demonstrates that the emission is spatially extended and resolved .",
    "if the gas is expanding radially with approximately spherical symmetry , then the narrow velocity interval around the central velocity corresponds to a cross section through the envelope in the plane of the sky .",
    "the central peak of cs j=1413 emission distribution provides additional direct evidence that cs is `` parent '' molecule , in accord with the detection of ro - vibrational transitions in absorption in the infrared ( keady & ridgeway 1993 ) , the detection of vibrationally excited cs emission ( turner 1987 , lucas & guelin 1999 , highberger et al .",
    "2000 ) , and interferometric imaging of cs j=21 emission ( lucas et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the cs molecules must originate close to the stellar photosphere , and they are lost from the expanding envelope through reactions that build more complex species , perhaps aided by shocks as suggested by willacy & cherchneff ( 1998 ) .",
    "the j=14 - 13 emission distribution shows no indication of the extended @xmath33 radius ring visible in the j=2 - 1 line , but emission on that size scale , if present , could not be detected on account of the small sma field of view .",
    "the reaction network for sulfur bearing carbon chains has been explored by millar , flores & markwick ( 2001 ) , who concluded that an initial cs abundance of @xmath34 is needed to match observations of c@xmath22s and c@xmath35s .",
    "models where cs is not a parent species , in which the cs fractional abundance rises from @xmath36 at radius @xmath37  cm , or @xmath385 at 150  pc , to a peak more than four orders of magnitude larger at radius @xmath39  cm , could not match observations of the longer carbon chains .",
    "the sma observations provide a robust _ lower limit _ to the cs abundance within a radius of @xmath40  r@xmath41 ( @xmath42  cm ) that supports the parent species scenario . under the assumption of a thermalized level population ,",
    "the total cs column density is given by @xmath43 where the molecular constants are @xmath44 debye , @xmath45 ghz , and the filling factor @xmath46 may be estimated as ( e.g. scoville et al . 1986 ) @xmath47 the lower limit to the line flux in a @xmath12 beam is @xmath48  jy  km  s@xmath5 , or @xmath49  k  km  s@xmath5 in brightness units . assuming small optical depth , @xmath50 , a kinetic temperature equal to the excitation of the upper level of the observed transition ( 246.8  k ) , which minimizes the column density required to explain the observed line flux , and a spherical volume with molecular hydrogen density equal to the critical density of the transition of @xmath51  @xmath52 , results in a lower limit to the cs fractional abundance of @xmath53 .",
    "the abundance close to the photosphere is likely substantially higher than this estimate ; highberger et al .",
    "( 2000 ) derive @xmath54 at a radius @xmath55  r@xmath41 ( @xmath56  cm ) from their multi - transition single dish observations . though the uncertainties are large , models such as those investigated by millar et al .",
    "( 2001 ) where the cs abundance rises from @xmath36 at radius @xmath37  cm are clearly in conflict with the high resolution images of the cs j=1413 emission .",
    "the sma observations show directly that the cs molecules are formed close to the stellar photosphere .",
    "detailed radiative transfer models that account for the observed spatial distribution are needed for an accurate determination of the cs abundance in the inner envelope .",
    "the effect of pulsational shocks could be important in establishing the cs abundance as this species is injected into the wind , and careful modeling may provide insight and constraints on the shock chemistry .    imaging the cs j=1413 line in the inner envelope of irc+10216 offers a first demonstration of the efficacy of the sma in the semi - transparent 450  @xmath2 m atmospheric window .",
    "calibration at these high frequencies should become considerably easier as more receivers for these frequencies are deployed at the sma , the correlator bandwidth is increased to 2  ghz , and simultaneous operation of a lower frequency band enables phase transfer .",
    "many more evolved stars , as well as other objects detected but with presently unresolved emission at short submillimeter wavelengths , are now accessible to imaging at the arcsecond scale .",
