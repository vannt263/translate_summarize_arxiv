    "the lattice hamiltonian @xmath98 is written as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the cluster hamiltonian , obtained by severing the hopping terms between different clusters , which are put into @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath102 be the matrix of inter - cluster hopping terms and @xmath103 the exact green function of the cluster .",
    "because of the periodicity of the super - lattice , @xmath102 can be expressed as a function of the reduced wave - vector @xmath104 and as a matrix in site indices within the cluster : @xmath105 .",
    "likewise , @xmath106 is a matrix in cluster site indices only , since all clusters are identical : @xmath107 .",
    "thus , hopping matrices and green functions in what follows will be @xmath104-dependent matrices of order @xmath97 , the number of sites within each cluster .",
    "the fundamental result of cpt for the system s one - electron green function is @xmath108 in practice @xmath103 is calculated numerically by the lanczos method and the cluster must be small enough for this to be possible . because the lattice tiling breaks the original translation invariance of the lattice ,",
    "a prescription is needed to restore the translation invariance of the resulting green function .",
    "the cpt prescription for this periodization is @xmath109 where now @xmath110 belongs to the brillouin zone of the original lattice and the sum is carried over cluster sites .",
    "this formula is exact in both the strong @xmath111 and the weak ( @xmath112 ) coupling limits .",
    "once the approximate interacting green function can be calculated , the spectral function @xmath113 follows . from there the density of states",
    "@xmath114 can be calculated by numerically integrating @xmath115 over wave - vectors and the existence of a spectral gap can be assessed .",

    "the variational cluster approximation ( vca ) is an extension of cpt in which parameters of the cluster hamiltonian @xmath100 may be treated variationally , according to potthoff s self - energy functional theory ( sft).@xcite in particular , it allows the emergence of spontaneously broken symmetries and provides an approximate value for the system s grand potential @xmath118 . in the case at hand , a single variational parameter",

    "it then follows that , @xmath170 thus the effective spin hamiltonian is tr symmetric .",
    "this implies that it does not contain any odd - spin terms .",

    "this is the spin - spin correlation function of the kitaev model .",
    "the kitaev model has a 6-spin conserved operator associated with every plaquette , @xmath179 which can take values @xmath180 and can be interpreted as a @xmath3 flux.@xcite the ground state is in the flux - free sector ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "the spin operators at site @xmath54 create a pair of flux tubes in two of the plaquettes that the site belongs to .",
    "since the time evolution does not change the flux configuration , the spin - spin correlation ( [ sscorr ] ) is zero except when @xmath54 and @xmath182 are nearest neighbors.@xcite    the second - order perturbation term is @xmath183 the time evolution is governed by @xmath140",

    "the problem now is to compute the resulting 6-spin correlation functions in the kitaev model .",
    "we do this in the fermionic representation of the spins in an enlarged hilbert space,@xcite in which the majorana fermion operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 are defined as follows : @xmath191 the physical subspace is defined by the constraint @xmath59 in terms of these majorana fermions , the leading order hamiltonian is , @xmath60 this hamiltonian describes majorana fermions ( @xmath56 ) , which we refer to as spinons , propagating in the background of static @xmath3 gauge fields ( @xmath62 ) the correlation function in equation ( [ g2 ] ) thus factorizes into propagators of the @xmath56 operators . since the spin operators create two units of flux on adjoining plaquettes , the majorana fermion propagators are in the background of an even number of fluxes at a few points .",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic form of @xmath63 when @xmath192 .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that in this limit , the propagators are the same as those in the flux - free background",
    ". their result can be physically understood by noting that the particles hopping far way from the flux pairs will not pick up any phases from them .",
    "thus we can expect the long wavelength modes to be insensitive to a few localized flux pairs .    to compute the asymptotic form or the propagators",
    ", we can derive the continuum theory of the low - energy modes in the flux - free background .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ fermham ] ) , when @xmath65 , reduces to nearest - neighbor hopping on a honeycomb lattice just as in graphene .",
    "graphene has low - energy dirac quasi - particles about two points , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , in the brillouin zone . however , since the @xmath68 fermions are majorana fermions , the excitations exist only over half the brillouin zone .",
    "thus the low - energy modes constitute a single dirac quasi - particle .",
    "the continuum theory is derived by introducing slowly varying fields @xmath70 such that @xmath193 substituting equation ( [ psidef ] ) in equation ( [ fermham ] ) it can be seen that the low energy continuum theory is that of a single dirac fermion . the propagator is defined as @xmath194 it can be computed to be @xmath195 where @xmath196 are the pauli matrices .",
    "we can then compute the correlation function in equation ( [ g2 ] ) to obtain the following expression :    @xmath197    where @xmath55 represents the sublattice index ( a or b ) , @xmath23 represents the three types of bonds @xmath198 and @xmath199 is the energy density of the kitaev model . we can obtain the @xmath200 and @xmath201 from the above correlation function by using the following property : a @xmath18 rotation about a sublattice @xmath202 point takes @xmath203 link to @xmath204 link , @xmath204 link to @xmath205 and @xmath205 link to @xmath203 , in a cycle . the direction is reversed for sublattice @xmath206 .",

    "the effective spin hamiltonian is given in equation ( [ effh ] ) . to investigate the instability of the asl to csl",
    ", we perform a mean - field treatment of the above hamiltonian in the fermionic representation ( [ mfdef ] ) .",

    "<S> we compute this perturbatively in the fermionic representation of the spins @xcite , in which the majorana fermion operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 are defined as follows : @xmath58 the physical subspace is defined by the constraint @xmath59 in terms of these majorana fermions , the leading order hamiltonian is @xmath60 where @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this hamiltonian describes majorana fermions ( @xmath56 ) , which we refer to as spinons , propagating in the background of static @xmath3 gauge fields ( @xmath62 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - spin correlation functions therefore factorize into propagators of the @xmath56 operators . since the spin operators create two units of flux on adjoining plaquettes , the majorana fermion propagators are in the background of an even number of fluxes at a few points .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the asymptotic form of the leading order correction , @xmath63 ( second order ) , when @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> tikhonov _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite have shown that in this limit , the propagators are the same as those in the flux - free background </S>",
    "<S> . their result can be physically understood by noting that the particles hopping far way from the flux pairs will not pick up any phases from them . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can expect the long wavelength modes to be insensitive to a few localized flux pairs .    to compute the asymptotic form or the propagators </S>",
    "<S> , we can derive the continuum theory of the low - energy modes in the flux - free background . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian ( [ fermham ] ) , when @xmath65 , reduces to nearest - neighbor hopping on a honeycomb lattice just as in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> graphene has low - energy dirac quasiparticles about two points , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , in the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the @xmath68 operators are hermitian @xmath69 , the excitations only exist over half the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the low - energy modes constitute a single dirac quasiparticle . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum theory is derived by introducing slowly varying fields @xmath70 such that @xmath71 @xmath72 satisfies the gapless dirac equation . any mass term for </S>",
    "<S> a _ single _ dirac fermion breaks tr invariance . </S>",
    "<S> thus the gaplessness is protected by the tr invariance of the effective spin model .    </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the dynamical spin - spin correlations in the long - wavelength limit following the methods of tikhonov _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite ( see supplemental material ) in terms of the products of the noninteracting @xmath68-fermion propagators @xmath73 @xmath74 as @xmath75 where @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the dirac point ( @xmath78 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath79 is the time , @xmath80 are the pauli spin matrices .    using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ spincorr ] ) and ( [ g ] ) , we find that the long - wavelength correlation function falls off as @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this exponent is the same as the one computed by single - spin perturbations studied in ref .   and can be motivated by simple dimensional counting . </S>",
    "<S> this proves the existence of the asl in the kitaev - hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> although the prefactor is extremely small for large @xmath4 ( @xmath82 ) , this is the leading behavior at long distances . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the effect of the perturbation can not be neglected for any value of @xmath4 , however large . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we can expect the strength of these correlations to grow as @xmath4 decreases .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , at large @xmath4 , the leading order contribution to the spin susceptibility is independent of @xmath4 as in the kitaev model , whereas the next order contribution goes as @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 dependence of the spin susceptibility will hence be of the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are constants independent of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> experimental methods for measuring the spin susceptibility in cold atom systems have recently been developed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath83 , for the lowest values of @xmath87 that the asl exists , ranges from @xmath88 , depending on @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , susceptibility measurements as a function of @xmath4 , with an accuracy of about @xmath89 , can provide evidence for the existence of the asl in this model .    </S>",
    "<S> the stability of the asl in this model comes from the preservation of tr symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated the possibility of spontaneous breaking of tr symmetry and the consequent emergence of a chiral spin liquid ( csl ) with a spinon gap ( see supplemental material ) . in the fermionized version@xcite of the effective spin model , where @xmath90 , we use a mean - field theory in which the vison and the spinon sectors are decoupled . </S>",
    "<S> this mean - field theory is exact for the kitaev model , which is obtained by putting @xmath25 in @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the csl solutions occur only for @xmath92 and for @xmath93 and , thus , are not seen in the mott regime @xmath94 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gap ] , we plot the spinon gap as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath29 .     for @xmath25,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in conclusion , we have shown that the kitaev - hubbard model shows a mott transition from a semi - metallic phase to an algebraic spin - liquid phase . </S>",
    "<S> the former breaks time - reversal symmetry whereas the latter preserves it . </S>",
    "<S> the asl is stabilized by tr symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we have proved the tr invariance in the mott phase ( to all orders in @xmath14 ) , using charge - conjugation symmetry . at intermediate @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> the asl phase occurs for a wide range of @xmath16 , which narrows down as @xmath4 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> concrete schemes to realize this model have been proposed@xcite , and experimental methods to probe the semi - metal at low @xmath4 values@xcite and the asl at large @xmath4 values @xcite exist . </S>",
