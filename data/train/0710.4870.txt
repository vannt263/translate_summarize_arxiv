    ".    on the other hand , if a tiling does not have flc , this can be hard to prove , see @xcite .",
    "the following theorem covers a broad class of substitution tilings where the inflation factor @xmath115 is an integer number .",
    "an example of such a tile - substitution is shown in figure [ substbsp ] ( right ) , where the inflation factor is 2 .",
    "a weaker version of this theorem was proved in @xcite , and it was realized that a negative answer to question 1 would yield a stronger result .",
    "thus question 1 was stated in @xcite as an open problem .",
    "[ flc ] let @xmath2 be a self - similar substitution tiling with polytopal prototiles and integer inflation factor .",

    "if the @xmath125-span of all vertices of the prototiles is a discrete lattice , then @xmath2 is of finite local complexity .",
    "it is remarkable that a requirement on the shape of the prototiles , without any word about the tile - substitution itself , suffices to guarantee flc .",
    "note , that we do not require the tiles to be convex at this point .",
    "it suffices that they are unions of finitely many convex polytopes .",
    "we begin by showing that all vertices contained in some supertile @xmath126 belong to the same connected component of the graph @xmath107 , with @xmath107 as in theorem [ graph ] .",
    "first we consider vertices on the edge of the support of a supertile .",
    "a ( super-)edge of the supertile @xmath20 consists of entire edges of some tiles .",
    "thus , all vertices in a single ( super-)edge of @xmath20 belong to the same component @xmath109 of @xmath107 .",
    "consequently , all vertices in the union of the edges of the supertile @xmath20 belong to @xmath109 .",
    "now , consider a @xmath36-face @xmath95 of @xmath20 , where @xmath127 .",
    "let all vertices on the boundary of @xmath95 ( of dimension @xmath94 ) be in the same component @xmath109 of @xmath107 .",
    "if there is a vertex @xmath3 in @xmath95 with @xmath128 , it belongs to a finite component of @xmath107 in @xmath95 which is disjoint with the boundary of @xmath95 .",
    "thus , @xmath95 can be extended to a @xmath36-dimensional polytopal tiling with the finite component @xmath109 in the corresponding graph @xmath107 .",
    "but this contradicts theorem [ graph ] .",
    "consequently , all vertices in @xmath95 belong to @xmath109 .",
    "inductively  by finite induction on @xmath36  all vertices contained in the supertile @xmath20 belong to @xmath109 .",
    "now , let @xmath129 be the lattice spanned by the vertices of the prototiles . since the inflation factor is an integer , the vertices of each supertile @xmath20 are elements of @xmath129 .",
    "all tile - vertices contained in @xmath20 belong to the same connected component of @xmath107 , thus  by definition of @xmath107  they are connected by a finite path of entire tile edges @xmath10 with some vertex of @xmath20 . by the condition in the theorem , @xmath130 for all such edges @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , all vertices in the supertile are contained in @xmath129 .",
    "consequently , all vertices of @xmath2 are elements of @xmath129 .",
    "in particular , if two tiles in @xmath2 have nonempty intersection , there is only a finite number of possible position of the vertices of these tiles , by the discreteness of @xmath129 . by lemma [ flclemma ]",

    "we have established the impossibility of a lonely vertex in a locally finite polytopal tiling in euclidean , spherical and hyperbolic space of any dimension .",

    "for instance , what can be said about lonely vertices in locally finite tilings with non - convex tiles ?",
    "another natural question is : what can be said about exactly two vertices ?",
    "since a lonely vertex is impossible , there may be restrictions for constellations around a point which is a vertex of exactly two tiles @xmath131 .",
    "indeed , one obtains the following result .",
    "roughly spoken , it means that edges of @xmath47 and @xmath132 either are coincident or opposite . in particular , the number of edges of @xmath47 containing @xmath3 equals the number of edges of @xmath132 containing @xmath3 . for clarity ,",
    "we state the result in terms of a - type and b - type polytopes .",
    "let a locally finite tiling of the unit sphere @xmath7 by polytopes contain exactly two a - type polytopes @xmath133 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a vertex of @xmath26 .",

    "so , let @xmath137 .",
    "we proceed by considering possible shapes of b - type polytopes .",
    "any b - type polytope is cut out of the unit sphere @xmath7 , embedded in @xmath138 , by halfspaces @xmath139 , where @xmath140 .",
    "each such halfspace @xmath141 can be represented by a vector @xmath142 which is normal to the bounding hyperplane @xmath143 : @xmath144 .",
    "we can assume the set of hyperplanes to be minimal .",
    "that is , the normal vectors of these hyperplanes are linearly independent ( otherwise there would be a superfluous defining inequality @xmath145 ; that means , a superfluous halfspace ) .",
    "therefore , the intersection @xmath146 is an @xmath147-dimensional linear subspace .",
    "since the considered polytope is b - type , it contains two endpoints of some diameter of the sphere .",
