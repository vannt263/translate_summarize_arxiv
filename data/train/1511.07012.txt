    "during the recent decades , several x - ray surveys were carried out and several catalogues of x - ray sources were produced , including most recent xmm - newton and chandra sources . however , until now rosat remains the only enough deep all - sky survey .",
    "rosat catalogues contain thousands of interesting objects , including agn ( especially many blazars ) , hot subdwarfs ( sb ) , white dwarfs ( wd ) , cataclysmic variables ( cv ) , carbon ( c ) stars , etc .",
    "rosat sources are listed in two main catalogues : * bright source catalogue ( bsc * , voges et al . 1999 ) and * faint source catalogue ( fsc * , voges et al .",
    "rosat bsc contains 18,806 sources with cr @xmath10.05 cts@xmath2s@xmath3 in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev energy range , while fsc contains 105,924 fainter sources ( cr @xmath40.05 cts@xmath2s@xmath3 ) .",
    "thus , in total 124,730 sources are available . among the identification",
    "works , the rosat bright sources ( rbs , schwope et al .",
    "2000 ) is well - known ; 2012 bsc sources with cr @xmath1 0.20 and @xmath5b@xmath5>30@xmath6 have been optically identified .",
    "however , most of the identified sources come from the hamburg quasar survey ( hqs , hagen et al .",
    "its low - dispersion spectra allow a preliminary classification of objects into a number of types , giving possibility to make up subsamples of objects for further studies .",
    "two main projects have been carried out : * hamburg rosat catalogue ( hrc * , zickgraf et al .",
    "2003 ) and * byurakan - hamburg rosat catalogue ( bhrc * , mickaelian et al .",
    "both have been carried out by means of hamburg quasar survey ( hqs ; hagen et al . 1995 ) low - dispersion spectra .",
    "hrc is based on rosat bsc and contains 5341 sources at @xmath5b@xmath5>20@xmath6 and @xmath7>0@xmath6 . + * bhrc * used brighter sources of rosat faint source catalogue ( fsc ) , thus extending the sample to count rates ( cr ) of photons @xmath1 0.04 ct / s in the area with galactic latitudes @xmath5b@xmath5@xmath120@xmath6 and declinations @xmath7@xmath10@xmath6 ( the area of hqs).it contains 2791 sources .",
    "main advantages of bhrc compared to hrc were the use of dss1 @xmath8 dss2 red / blue / ir images ( which allowed revealing faint objects , more details , extension , proper motions , variability , and accurate positions ) , the use of 2d hqs images ( for quicker selection and better classification ) , the refinement of classification ( identifying qsos / agn from sed ) , introducing new class of interacting galaxies ( pairs and groups ) , search in real 3@xmath9 positional errors for each source compared to standard search radius in hrc , cross - correlation with maps and usno - b , associations in ned , simbad , catalogues of agn , wds , and cvs . out of 2791 sources , only 95 have no identification ; 2696 are identified with 3187 objects ( some x - ray sources are identified with double or multiple object ) .",
    "+ thus , out of 124,730 rosat sources , only @xmath1010,000 have optically identifications and rosat catalogues still remain as a rich source for new interesting objects .",
    "to improve the accuracy of measurements and collect more data for hrc sources , we have carried out similar to bhrc studies for hrc , thus establishing homogeneous joint sample of rosat identifications .",
    "a * joint hrc / bhrc catalogue * has been created by merging hrc and bhrc , altogether 8132 sources ( paronyan @xmath8 mickaelian 2015 ) , the largest sample of identified rosat sources . together with combining data from the two catalogues , we have checked and added many new ones , as well as corrected many errors and misidentifications .",
    "based on hrc / bhrc sample , we have established the types of objects that appear to be x - ray sources .",
    "main types of optical counterparts are : bright ( typically spiral ) galaxies , blue galaxies ( agn candidates ) , interacting galaxies ( pairs @xmath8 groups , those with red colours ? ) , blue compact galaxies ( bcg ) that appear to be qsos and seyferts , blue stellar objects ( bsos ) that appear to be qsos or white dwarfs ( wd ) , bright stars ( mostly fg type , including pairs and triples ) , k - m stars ( including binary k - stars ) , wds and subdwarfs , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "* table 1 * gives the distribution of the identified objects by types in hrc , bhrc and joint hrc / bhrc catalogues .",
    "+    .distribution of objects by types in hrc , bhrc and joint hrc / bhrc . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we give several examples of different objects based on our sdss classification .",
    "many bright galaxies show x - ray ( as well as they radiate at all wavelength ranges ) even without having any sign of activity .",
    "one of our tasks is to establish the limit of rosat detection of normal bright galaxies .",
    "then all fainter objects may turn to be relevant agn candidates even without having their spectra .",
    "qsos are most typical and comprise the largest sample among extragalactic x - ray sources . in * figure 3",
    "* we give two examples of hrc / bhrc qsos revealed as qso candidates based on hqs low - dispersion spectra and later on discovered by means of sdss medium resolution spectra .          given that bl lacs typically do not show any ( emission or absorption ) lines , it is rather difficult to distinguish them from stars ( as very often stellar absorption lines are weak and not detectable ) . however , due to synchrotron radiation , their continua are linear compared to the characteristic planck curve for the stars .",
    "hence , only high quality spectra and very accurate reduction may reveal their spectral energy distribution and prove their nature even without measuring the redshift . on the other hand , presence of radio",
    "may also be a relevant criterion to distinguish bll against blue stars .",
    "narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies are among the most interesting objects in our sample .",
    "we have found different types of such objects ; nls1.0 , nls1.2 and nls1.5 , as well as nls1.8 and nls1.9 may exist , however due to small intensity of their broad lines , only high signal - to - noise and high resolution spectra may reveal them . in * figure 4",
    "* , two examples of nls1s are given .",
    ".,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      other agn include various types of seyferts ( from sy1.0 to sy2.0 in the order of agn luminosity ) and liners .",
    "we give in * figure 5 * sdss spectra for 2 seyfert galaxies ; ( left ) sy1.5 ( broad and narrow components have similar intensity ) and ( right ) sy1.8 ( broad components are weak and observed only for h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 lines ) .     and h@xmath12 lines).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      starburst ( or hii ) galaxies have no agn in the center , however due to undergoing intense star formation process ( sfr is a few m@xmath13 yr@xmath3 , but may reach up to 103 m@xmath13 yr@xmath3 ) and presence of heated gas they show strong balmer and some forbidden emission lines ( oiii , oii , oi , nii , sii and others .",
    "they may have enough strong stellar component , as well as strong continuum , which sometimes is very blue . in * figure 6",
    "* , two examples of hii galaxies are given .",
    "absorption line galaxies do not show any sign of activity when studies by means of optical spectra .",
    "however , the presence of strong x - ray and in many cases also radio suggests that they are hidden agn , so that they are completely opaque in optical light , but they may be exactly the same agn similar to classical seyferts .",
    "we give in * figure 7 * two examples of such galaxies that are typically red ones .",
    "we have discovered red interacting galaxies that are strong x - ray sources .",
    "most powerful extragalactic ir sources ( ulirgs and hlirgs ) are interacting / merging galaxies .",
    "however , the x - ray sample among such objects must be investigated in detail .",
    "many remote clusters have been detected in rosat as single point sources .",
    "the question is to check if there are strong x - ray emitters among the cluster galaxies ( e.g. central giant ones ) or x - ray comes from the intergalactic gas in the cluster .",
    "new x - ray missions , such as xmm - newton and chandra may answer this question .",
    "as x - ray sources contain many interesting stars , some fraction of contamination is always present , especially because our former classification was based on low - dispersion spectra .",
    "typical types of stars that appear to be x - ray sources are : white dwarfs ( wd ) , cataclysmic variables ( cv ) , late - type stars ( k , m , c ) and others .",

    "is there a correlation between optical and radio variability of agn ?",
    "what is the definition of blazars ?",
    "the question of definition of blazars is still open .",
