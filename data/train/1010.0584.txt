    "nonclassicality of optical fields has been a topic of great interest in quantum optics and quantum information processing @xcite , which is usually associated with quantum interference and entanglement .",
    "the phase space wigner function ( wf ) @xcite of quantum states of light is a powerful tool for investigating such nonclassical effects .",
    "the wf was first introduced by wigner in 1932 to calculate quantum corrections to a classical distribution function of a quantum - mechanical system .",
    "the partial negativity of the wf is indeed a good indication of the highly nonclassical character of the state @xcite and monitors a decoherence process of a quantum state , e. g. the excited coherent state in both photon - loss and thermal channels @xcite , the single - photon subtracted squeezed vacuum state in both amplitude decay and phase damping channels @xcite , and so on r5,r6,r7,r8,r8a .",
    "nonlinear interaction of light in a medium provides a very useful framework to study various nonclassical properties of quantum states of radiation .",
    "the kerr medium is one of the simplest nonlinearity , which shall allow us to investigate the full time - dependent wf dynamics with or without a quantum noise .",
    "recently , a fokker - planck equation for the wf evolution in a noisy kerr medium ( @xmath0 nonlinearity ) is presented @xcite .",
    "then the authors numerically solved this equation assuming coherent state as an initial condition and discussed its dissipation effects . however , for any initial condition , as far as we are concerned , there is no report about the wf evolution . on the other hand , by using the thermo entangled state representation ( tesr ) we solved various master equations to obtain density operators with an infinite operator - sum representation @xcite and then revealed that the wf of density operator can be expressed as an overlap between two pure states ( see eq .",
    "( [ 2.8 ] ) below ) @xcite .",
    "this brings much convenience to calculate time evolution of wfs when quantum decoherence happens .",
    "thus the tesr is beneficial to quantum decoherence theory .    in this paper",
    ", we shall appeal the tesr @xmath1 to treat the wf evolution at any initial condition in self - kerr medium with photon loss and present a new formula to calculate time evolution of the wf for quantum decoherence .",
