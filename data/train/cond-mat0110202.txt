    "the roughening properties of elastic manifolds in the presence of quenched disorder is a well studied problem .",
    "the subject of study is usually the asymptotic ( long - distance ) regime in which one wishes to compute the roughening exponent @xmath0 of the @xmath1-dimensional elastic manifold ( described by a displacement field @xmath2 ) defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the position vector in the @xmath1-dimensional configuration space and where the brackets represent an average over thermal fluctuations and the overline an average over the realizations of the quenched disorder . obviously , the study of the crossover between short distances , where the thermal fluctuations dominate and the long - distance behaviour , which is determined by the disorder , is also of interest . among the methods applied to the study of this problem",
    "are the use of imry - ma type of arguments @xcite , the mapping of one - dimensional interfaces in two dimensions to the noisy burgers equation @xcite , which yields an exact result for the roughening exponent @xcite , variational approaches involving replica averaging and replica symmetry breaking @xcite and functional renormalization group calculations @xcite .",
    "the role played by long - range interactions does not seem to be so well understood , although it follows from the one - loop functional rg results of emig and nattermann @xcite that in the important case of a magnetic domain - wall in the presence of long - range dipolar interactions , one simply needs to replace the expansion parameter @xmath5 by @xmath6 ( where @xmath1 is the dimension of the manifold ) in the expressions for the critical exponents obtained in the absence of dipolar interactions , in order to account for the presence of these interactions @xcite .",
    "in particular , if one applies this result to the case of a line domain in a thin magnetic film ( @xmath7 ) , the effective expansion parameter is @xmath8 in both cases , which means that in this case and to one - loop order , the critical exponents obtained are the same in the absence or presence of dipolar interactions .",
    "although one expects the rg calculations to provide a qualitative understanding at low dimensions compared to the upper critical dimension ( @xmath9 in this case ) , it is still questionable to what extend one can perform such analytical continuation using just the one - loop results .",
    "furthermore , the results of emig and nattermann were based on a series expansion of the dipolar energy @xcite which meant that , in the absence of disorder , the hamiltonian describing the low energy degrees of freedom of the domain wall was quadratic in the domain - wall displacement field , i.e. the random potential is the only source of non - linearity in the problem .",
    "one still needs to justify that such approximation is sufficient @xcite .",
    "having in mind such difficulties , we wish to discuss the properties of a one - dimensional domain wall in a two - dimensional ferromagnetic film , in the presence of dipolar interactions and a short - range correlated random field , where the dipolar interaction is treated beyond the quadratic approximation .",
    "we wish to check whether it is still possible to map such a problem to a ( modified ) burgers equation , as was done by huse et al .",
    "@xcite for the case of random - bond disorder and by zhang @xcite for the case of random - field disorder , in the absence of long - range interactions .",
    "such a mapping was achieved because one can map the line domain to the world line of a quantum particle in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the free energy of the line domain can then be shown to obey a schrdinger equation in imaginary time in the presence of a random potential .",
    "a cole - hopf transformation can then be used to convert this equation into a noisy burgers equation with additive noise , for which the stationary distribution is known in one - dimension @xcite .",
    "this allows one to compute the roughening exponent . in our case",
    ", the presence of the dipolar interaction does not allow one to write the energy of the domain wall as an action for a single quantum particle , but instead we obtain an action for a quantum particle which interacts with a annealed ` vector potential ' , whose propagator is determined by the dipolar propagator . in 1 + 1 dimensions ,",
    "a gauge transformation allows us to substitute the vector potential by a scalar one , which can then be integrated out , leaving us with an action similar to the action of a polaron as considered by feynman @xcite , i.e. the dipolar interaction introduces a ` self - retarded ' interaction of the particle with itself .",
    "despite the fact that such action can not be integrated exactly , we can still apply a variational method in the spirit of feynman @xcite , in which one introduces replicas of the system in order to average the free energy of the domain wall over the realizations of the random field . using the hierarchical replica symmetry breaking ansatz of parisi @xcite",
    ", we were able to derive a set of non - linear equations whose self - consistent solution yields the long - distance physics of the problem within the realm of this approximation . with this method , we are able to treat two different situations .",
    "the one of a thin ferromagnetic film grown on a non - magnetic substrate , in which the dipolar interaction has the usual three dimensional form , and the one of a thin ferromagnetic film grown between two type i superconductors , i.e. the case of a superconductor / ferromagnet / superconductor ( sc / fm / sc ) heterostructure .",
    "we have shown elsewhere @xcite that in this case the dipolar interaction has a two - dimensional form at small wave - vectors , coming from the renormalization of the magnetic energy due to the meissner effect in the superconductors . although we were unable to obtain an analytic solution of the variational non - linear equations , we were able to justify that in the case of two - dimensional dipolar interactions ( i.e. for the sc / fm / sc heterostructure ) , the quadratic approximation is indeed adequate .",
    "this case is not only easier to treat analytically , it is also more interesting than the case of three dimensional dipolar interactions , for which one expects the dipolar interaction to be irrelevant ( see above ) . therefore , we restrict our discussion to the case of two - dimensional dipolar interactions in this paper .",
    "furthermore , we can also show that in this case , if one works within the quadratic approximation , the elastic energy of the domain - wall has the same analytical form as the energy of a domain wall in a ferroelastic material as studied by kolomeiskii et al . @xcite and also of the energy of a liquid - gas interface in a disordered solid , as studied by hazareesing and mzard @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "one obtains , in two dimensions , a value of @xmath10 for the roughening exponent .",
    "this is indeed the value that we obtain for the roughening exponent in our problem .",
    "it should be nevertheless noticed that these three problems , though mathematically similar have a different physical origin and motivation .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section ii , we derive a low - energy hamiltonian describing the nel domain - wall elastic degrees of freedom . this hamiltonian can be interpreted as the action in imaginary time of a quantum particle in 1 + 1 dimensions . in section iii , we use the replica trick to average over the random field realizations , which generates a many particle non - quadratic action . in section",
    "iv , we introduce a generalization of the variational ansatz of mzard and parisi which allows us to consider the effect of the short - range correlated disorder and of the non - local dipolar term in the many particle action .",
    "one obtains a set of non - linear equations which have to be solved self - consistently . in section",
    "v , we perform the analysis of these equations in the particular case of the hierarchical replica symmetry breaking solution of parisi and we discuss the validity of the quadratic approximation for the dipolar term in these equations , which permits to determine the roughening exponent of the domain wall .",
    "finally , in section vi , we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a nel ( i.e. @xmath11 degrees ) domain - wall in a thin two - dimensional ferromagnetic film in the presence of dipolar interactions and a short - range correlated quenched random field .",
    "the magnetization is in the plane of the film . in the straight domain configuration",
    ", the wall is oriented along the @xmath12 axis and the center of the wall is located at @xmath13 .",
    "the thermal and random field fluctuations give rise to deviations of the domain - wall from its straight configuration , i.e. at a given position @xmath12 , the center of the domain is displaced from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ( we neglect overhangs ) . in this case ,",
    "equation ( [ eq-1 ] ) reduces to @xmath15 the distance @xmath16 is considered to be very large with respect to the lattice spacing and to the length over which the random field is correlated ( see below ) . in the absence of dipolar interactions , one can , as stated above , through a mapping to a schrdinger equation @xcite , show that @xmath17 .    in order to determine the elastic energy of the domain - wall , we consider the underlying system of ferromagnetic spins to be in a square lattice with lattice constant @xmath18 and overall dimensions @xmath19 .",
    "the system has anti - periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath20 direction ( in order that there is a single domain - wall in the system ) and periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath12 direction and is at finite temperature @xmath21 .",
    "such system is described by a ( classical ) xy model hamiltonian , with dipolar interactions and in a random field , @xmath22 for the case of two - dimensional dipolar interactions ( i.e. for the sc / fm / sc heterostructure ) , the constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 are given in the mks system by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the magnetic permitivity of the vacuum , @xmath28 the bohr magneton and @xmath29 the land factor of the spin system .",
    "the constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 are , respectively , the london penetration depth and relative magnetic permitivity of the superconductor . in this case ,",
    "@xmath32 . in the case of three dimensional dipolar interactions , which we will not consider",
    ", @xmath33 and @xmath34 is equal to @xmath35 .",
    "the quantities @xmath36 and @xmath1 have the dimensions of energy @xcite . the field @xmath37 is a random field with gaussian correlations , i.e. @xmath38 . in order to stabilize the domain - wall ,",
    "we have added to the hamiltonian above an easy - axis anisotropy term , along the @xmath12 axis , represented by the last term in ( [ eq1 ] ) .    for a straight nel domain - wall",
    ", the spin configuration has the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the site label and where @xmath41 goes from @xmath42 when @xmath43 to @xmath44 when @xmath45 , with @xmath46 being the value of the spin .",
    "the function @xmath41 changes its value from @xmath42 to @xmath44 in a region of width @xmath47 around @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath47 is typically of the order of tens of nanometers @xcite and we are only interested in the long - distance properties of the domain - wall , we can write @xmath48 .",
    "if the center of the domain - wall is displaced from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , the spin configuration becomes @xmath51 we wish to compute the partition function @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the energy difference between a configuration described by the displacement @xmath14 and the straight domain configuration .",
    "we define the discrete fourier transforms @xmath54 where @xmath55 belongs to the first brillouin zone .",
    "we will approximate the sums over @xmath40 by integrals , according to the formulas , @xmath56 valid for a square lattice .",
    "it can be shown that the ( positive ) contribution to the exchange energy coming from the domain - wall deformation is given to second order in the displacement field , by @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the total number of sites and where we have expanded @xmath59 . in real space , equation ( [ eq9 ] ) reads @xmath60 which has the same form as the kinetic part of the action of a particle of mass @xmath61 in one dimension , with @xmath62 being the line - tension of the domain wall .",
    "the contribution coming from the random field can be shown to be equal to @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "this formula can be made plausible if we consider instead a constant field along @xmath12 .",
    "it can also be easily seen from ( [ eq9 ] ) that the easy - axis anisotropy term does not contribute to the deformation energy of the domain - wall .",
    "since we wish to compute the partition function , we have to consider the factor @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the area of the sample . for two - dimensional dipolar interactions , @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite . for three dimensional dipolar interactions , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "thus , by considering the different dipolar kernels @xmath74 , one can treat the two different cases .",
    "using a hubbard - stratonovich transformation , we write @xmath66 as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a normalization factor .",
    "we can now show that @xmath77 from which it follows that @xmath78 and one can see that there is no contribution to the dipolar energy when @xmath79 .",
    "the partition function of the domain wall s degrees of freedom involves the functional integration of the boltzmann factor @xmath80 , over the space of functions @xmath14 .",
    "we shall now make a change in our notation .",
    "we will write @xmath81 the subscript @xmath82 stands for the fact that the wave - vectors @xmath83 are discrete , due to the periodic boundary conditions along @xmath84 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "if we use this notation in the formulae above , we have , collecting all the factors , the following expression for the partition function @xmath85 where the action @xmath46 is given by @xmath86 this is the action of a single quantum particle in 1 + 1 dimensions , with ` mass ' @xmath61 and ` charge ' @xmath87 , at ` inverse temperature ' @xmath88 and with a ` planck constant ' equal to @xmath89 .",
    "such particle is in a external random potential @xmath90 and interacts with a ` vector potential ' @xmath91 @xcite characterized by a propagator equal to @xmath92 .",
    "this result belongs to the well known class of mappings of @xmath93 dimensional problems of classical statistical mechanics to @xmath94 dimensional quantum problems .",
    "now , since one has periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath84 ( @xmath12 ) axis , the following identity holds @xmath95 which corresponds to a gauge transformation of the action @xcite .",
    "the use of this identity eliminates the dependence on the ` velocity ' @xmath96 in all terms of equation ( [ eq18 ] ) except the first one .",
    "the action @xmath46 now reads @xmath97 we can now integrate out the field @xmath91 , obtaining an action entirely in terms of @xmath98 alone .",
    "we obtain @xmath99 this action can be used to compute the roughening exponent of the domain wall .",
    "equation ( [ eq21 ] ) also shows that , apart from the interaction with the @xmath84 dependent random potential @xmath100 , the action @xmath46 is analogous to the action of a one - dimensional polaron , as written by feynman @xcite .",
    "however , in order to compute the roughening exponent , one has to determine the following quantity @xmath101 which involves determining the average of the distribution of quenched disorder over a quotient .",
    "this type of averaging places the same problem as when one needs to average over the free energy of the system , i.e. one needs to determine the average @xmath102 , instead of simply averaging over the partition function @xmath103 .",
    "this can be seen by including a source field coupled to @xmath98 in @xmath103 .",
    "the two - point correlation function appearing in ( [ eq23 ] ) can be computed from @xmath102 by differentiating it with respect to the sources and taking these sources to be zero .",
    "we need to perform the average over the random field @xmath104 , which obeys a gaussian distribution with a second moment equal to @xmath105 in order to perform the averaging over disorder in the free energy , one introduces @xmath34 distinct copies ( replicas ) of the system @xcite and makes use of the identity @xmath106 one performs the disorder average over @xmath107 for integer @xmath34 and makes the analytical continuation to @xmath108 .",
    "one obtains @xmath109 where the ` replicated ' action @xmath110 is given by @xmath111 and where the last term represents the inter - replica interaction , due to the presence of the random potential .",
    "we have included in @xmath110 the effect of an applied field @xmath112 .",
    "this term gives rise to the second term in the action , which is a harmonic potential .",
    "the presence of this term is necessary to guarantee that @xmath110 is bounded from below , given that the last term of ( [ eq27 ] ) comes with a negative sign .",
    "@xmath113 can be set to @xmath114 at the end of the calculations .",
    "the action ( [ eq27 ] ) can not be integrated exactly .",
    "therefore , we need to develop an approximation scheme . we shall follow mzard and parisi @xcite and goldschmidt @xcite .",
