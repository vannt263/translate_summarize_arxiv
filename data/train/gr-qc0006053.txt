    "thermal noise is a fundamental limit to the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors , such as the ones being built in the use by the ligo project@xcite .",
    "thermal noise is associated with sources of energy dissipation @xcite , following the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "thermal noise comes in at least two important kinds : one due to the brownian motion of the mirrors , associated with the losses in the mirrors material ; and another due to the suspension of the mirrors , due to the losses in the wires material .",
    "the limits following from these assumptions ( losses due to elastic properties of materials ) are a lower limit to the noise in the detector , since there may always be other sources of energy dissipation in imperfect clamps , mirror attachments , etc .",
    "but the correct calculation of the thermal noise limit is essential to the design of detectors and diagnostics of the already - built detectors .",
    "we will deal in this article with thermal noise of suspensions ( not of internal modes of the mirrors themselves ) , and assume only losses due to the elasticity of the suspension wires .",
    "the calculation of thermal noise can be done in several ways @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "all of these follow the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) , but a complication arises because in suspensions there are two sources of energy ( gravitational and elastic ) , but only one of them is `` lossy '' ( elastic energy ) .",
    "moreover , the losses in the suspension wires are associated with their bending , and seems to be localized at the top and bottom of the wires .",
    "the ways to include these features into the thermal noise calculations are different enough that they have led to some confusion among the gravitational wave community . also , attention has been paid mostly to the horizontal motion of the suspension , although all modes ( angular , transverse , and vertical ) appear to some degree into the detector s noise .",
    "we present a method to calculate thermal noise that allows the prediction of the suspension thermal noise in all its 6 degrees of freedom , from the energy dissipation due to the elasticity of the suspension wires .",
    "we also show how the contributions of thermal noise in different directions can be sensed by the interferometer through the laser beam position and direction .",
    "the results will follow from the consideration of the coupled equations of the suspension and the continuous wire , first presented in @xcite for just the horizontal degree of freedom .",
    "we show how this approach encompasses and explains previous ways to approximate the thermal noise limit in gravitational wave detectors .",
    "we show how this approach can be extended to more complicated suspensions to be used in future ligo detectors . to our knowledge , this is the first time the thermal noise of angular degrees of freedom is presented , and that all suspension degrees of freedom are calculated in an unified approach .",
    "since the full treatment of the problem is somewhat involved , we present first the problem without considering the elasticity of the wire , but adding a second , lossy , energy source to the gravitational energy in the treatment of the mechanical pendulum , and introduce the concepts of `` dilution factors '' , and `` effective '' quality factors .",
    "we also start with one and two - degrees of freedom suspensions instead of 6-dof . with these tools ,",
    "most of the issues can be clearly presented and then we follow to the full treatment of the ligo suspensions , presenting the implications for ligo .",
    "the full treatment of this case , considering the elastic coupling of the wire to the suspension , was presented in @xcite . here , we will present the simpler `` mechanical '' treatment of this case , which will introduce the concepts of `` dilution factors '' , and measured vs. effective quality factors .",
    "we first recapitulate the calculation of thermal noise in the simplest case , a suspended point mass .",
    "the potential energy is @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the kinetic energy is @xmath2 .",
    "the admittance to an external force @xmath3 is given by @xmath4    the admittance has a pole at the system eigenfrequency @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath6 is real , the resonance has an infinite amplitude and zero width .",
    "if the spring constant has an imaginary part representing an energy loss , @xmath7 , then the amplitude @xmath8 is finite , and the peak has a width determined by the complex part of the eigenfrequency @xmath9 .",
    "the width of the peak is characterized with a quality factor @xmath10 , and it is usually measured from the free decay time @xmath11 of the natural oscillation at the frequency @xmath12 : @xmath13 .    the thermal noise is proportional to the real part of the admittance , and thus to @xmath14 : @xmath15=\\frac{wk\\phi}{(k - m{\\omega}^2)^2+k^2\\phi^2}\\ ] ]    we are usually interested in frequencies well above @xmath12 , since the pendulum frequency @xmath16 in gravitational wave detectors is usually below 1 hz , and the detectors have their maximum sensitivity at  100 hz . at those frequencies ,",
    "the thermal noise is @xmath17\\sim\\frac{4k_bt_0{\\omega}_0 ^ 2\\phi}{m{\\omega}^5 } \\label{simpleosc}\\ ] ]    this how we see that the measured decay of the pendulum mode can be used to predict the suspension thermal noise at gravitational wave frequencies .",
    "some beautiful examples of these difficult measurements and their use for gravitational wave detectors are presented in @xcite , for example .",
    "next , we consider a suspended point mass , but we now assume there two sources of energy , gravitational and elastic , each with its own spring constant .",
    "the potential energy is then @xmath18 , and @xmath15=\\frac{{\\omega}(k_g\\phi_g+k_e\\phi_e)}{((k_g+k_e)-m{\\omega}^2)^2+(k_g+k_e)^2\\phi^2}\\ ] ]    if we assume that @xmath19 , then @xmath15\\sim\\frac{{\\omega}(k_g\\phi_g+k_e\\phi_e)}{(k_g - m{\\omega}^2)^2+k_g^2\\phi^2}\\ ] ] and at high frequencies @xmath17\\sim \\frac{4k_bt_0(k_g\\phi_g+k_e\\phi_e)}{m^2{\\omega}^5}\\ ] ]    if @xmath20 ( `` gravity is lossless '' ) , or at least @xmath21 , then @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "we see that is the same expression as if we had just one energy source with a complex spring constant @xmath24 .",
    "this is why we call the factor @xmath25 the `` dilution factor '' : the elastic energy is the one contributing the loss factor to the otherwise loss - free @xmath26 , but `` diluted '' by the small factor @xmath25 .",
    "the dilution factor is also equal to the ratio of elastic energy to gravitational energy @xmath27 .",
    "the concept of a dilution factor is very useful because it is usually easier to measure the loss factor @xmath28 associated with the elastic spring constant than the quality factor of the pendulum mode .",
    "this is because @xmath29 is usually a function of the complex young modulus @xmath30 , and the imaginary part of the young modulus is easily measurable for most fiber materials , and can even be found in tables of material properties .",
    "( of course , there are subtleties to this argument , in particular with thermoelastic or surface losses @xcite , but we are assuming the minimum material loss ) .",
    "this case is a particular case of the one treated in @xcite , and here we just mention it to present the approach taken to the full problem , and present some new relevant aspects .",
    "we want to include the elasticity of the wire in the equations of motion , so we treat the suspension wire as an elastic beam , and then we have pendulum degree of freedom @xmath31 , plus the wire s infinite degrees of freedom @xmath32 of transverse motion .",
    "we define a coordinate @xmath33 , that starts at the top of the wire @xmath34 , and ends at the attachment point to the mirror , @xmath35 .",
    "correspondingly , we will have an eigenfrequency , associated with the pendulum mode , and an infinite series of `` violin '' modes .",
    "the potential energy is @xmath36 , and the kinetic energy is @xmath37 .",
    "the solutions to the wire equation of motion , with boundary conditions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are @xmath40 , and the equation of motion for the mass @xmath41 subject to an external force @xmath42 is @xmath43 .",
    "the admittance @xmath44 has a pole at the pendulum frequency @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , and an infinite number of poles at the violin mode frequencies , at frequencies @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "the spring `` constant '' associated with the wire and gravity s restoring force @xmath49 is in fact a function of frequency , although it is the usual constant @xmath50 for frequencies below the violin modes , where @xmath46 . at frequencies above the first violin mode ,",
    "the spring function is not even positive definite , or finite .",
    "the function @xmath6 is real at all frequencies because we havent added any source of energy loss yet .",
    "we introduce energy loss in the system by adding the wire elastic energy to the system , and then assuming a complex young modulus .",
    "the potential energy is now @xmath51 .",
    "the equation of motion for the wire is @xmath52 a fourth order equation with boundary conditions @xmath38 , @xmath53 , and @xmath39 . the wire slope at the bottom , @xmath54 , is a free parameter ( since we are assuming a point mass ) , and the variation of the lagrangian with respect to @xmath54 provides the fourth boundary condition for the wire : @xmath55 .",
    "we can find an exact solution for the wire shape as a function of @xmath31 , trigonometric functions of @xmath56 , and hyperbolic functions of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 are solutions to @xmath59 which approximate at low frequencies the perfect string wavenumber , @xmath60 and a constant `` elastic '' wavenumber , @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the distance @xmath62 is the characteristic elastic distance over which the wire bends , especially at top and bottom clamps . in ligo test mass suspensions , @xmath632 mm , a small fraction of @xmath64 m .",
    "the approximations @xmath60 and @xmath61 are valid for frequencies that satisfy @xmath65 , about 12 khz for ligo , so we will use them in the remainder of this article .",
    "it is also equivalent to @xmath66 .",
    "we also use an approximate solution for the wire shape , good to order @xmath67(@xmath68 ( ! ) for ligo ) :",
    "@xmath69    the coefficients @xmath70 are functions of @xmath31 and @xmath71 , and thus , functions of frequency : @xmath72    in the limit @xmath73 , we recover the perfect wire solution , @xmath74 .",
    "the ratio @xmath75 measures how much more ( or less ) the wire bends at the bottom than at the top .",
    "the elastic energy is well approximated by the contribution of the exponential terms in the wire shape , at top and bottom : @xmath76 . at low frequencies where @xmath46 , the ratio @xmath77 , indicating that the wire bends much more at the top than at the bottom ( recall this is a point mass ) .",
    "the equation of motion for the mass when there is an external force @xmath42 is    @xmath78    the ratio of the elastic force to the gravitational force , @xmath79 , is of order @xmath66 , and thus it was dropped . if we now consider @xmath80 complex , then the spring function @xmath81 is also complex , and the admittance will have a non - zero real part . at frequencies below the violin modes",
    "where @xmath46 , we have @xmath82 , an expression that suggests a split between a real gravitational spring constant @xmath83 and a complex elastic spring constant @xmath84 .",
    "however , this distinction can only be done in the approximation @xmath85 , and low frequencies @xmath86 . in general , however , we _ can not _ strictly derive separate gravitational and elastic spring constants from their respective potential energy expressions : notice that the total , complex spring constant @xmath87 was derived from the variation of the _ gravitational _ potential energy term , which becomes complex because we use a wire shape involving the complex distance @xmath88 , satisfying the boundary conditions .",
    "where the approximations @xmath89 are valid , we can consider the case of two separate spring constants and thus a `` dilution factor '' for the pendulum loss , @xmath90 , where the numerical value corresponds to ligo parameters in appendix 1 .",
    "however , if we numerically calculate the _ exact _ pendulum mode quality factor , we get @xmath91 : this would be the _ measured _ q from a decay time of the pendulum mode , if there are no extra losses .",
    "did we make a `` factor of 2 '' mistake ?",
    "in fact , this factor of 2 has haunted some people in the community ( including myself)@xcite , but there is a simple explanation .",
    "since the elastic complex spring constant is proportional to @xmath88 , and @xmath88 is proportional to the _ square root _ of the young modulus , then when we make @xmath30 complex @xmath92 , we get @xmath93 .",
    "that is , we get an extra dilution factor of two between the wire loss @xmath14 and the pendulum loss : @xmath94 , very close to the actual value .",
    "this teaches us that if the spring constant of the dissipative force is not just proportional to @xmath30 , we will get correction factors @xmath95 .",
    "the thermal noise below the violin modes is well approximated by the thermal noise of a simple oscillator , as in eqn.[simpleosc ] , with natural eigenfrequency @xmath96 and loss @xmath97 .",
    "we then call @xmath97 the `` effective '' loss , in this case equal to the pendulum loss ( but we will see this is not always the case ) .",
    "we saw that the complex spring constant @xmath98was split into gravitational @xmath50 and elastic @xmath99 components .",
    "however both were derived from the _ gravitational _ force @xmath100 , since the _ elastic _",
    "force , @xmath101 , was negligible .",
    "it is because the wire _ shape _",
    "@xmath32 is different due to elasticity , that the function @xmath102 is different from the pure gravitational expression @xmath103 .",
    "the way we split gravitational and elastic contributions to the spring constant and then got a dilution factor , is only valid at low frequencies .",
    "so the argument we posed in the previous section about a dilution factor applied to the calculation in the thermal noise in the gravitational wave band is in priciple not applicable here , especially when taking into account that the total force was contributed by the variation of just the _ gravitational _ potential energy , with the elasticity in the wire shape .",
    "however , using the wire shape without low frequency approximations , we can numerically evaluate the integrals that make up the potential and elastic energies ( using a _ real _ @xmath88 ) , and compare the ratio @xmath104 with the `` low frequency '' dilution factor @xmath105 .",
    "we show the calculation of elastic and gravitational potential energies , and their ratio , in fig.[ptmass ] . at low frequencies ,",
    "the ratio is constant , and equal to @xmath106 : this is the dilution factor between the wire loss @xmath14 and the pendulum loss @xmath107 , also the one to use for a simple - oscillator approximation of the thermal noise .",
    "it is _ not _ the ratio of the `` gravitational '' and `` elastic '' spring constants at low frequencies , but as we explained , we had no reason to expect that , since @xmath108 . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the ratio @xmath109 is not constant , and it gives correctly the dilution factors for the quality factors of the violin modes .",
    "notice that the loss at the violin modes increases with mode number , as noted in @xcite : @xmath110 , and this anharmonic behavior is well followed by the energy ratio .    in summary , the concept of dilution factor is strictly true only when the total restoring _ force _ can be split into two forces , one lossless and one dissipative , both represented with spring constants . in the general case ,",
    "if we can only split the _ potential energy _ into two terms , one lossless and another dissipative , then the ratio of the energies calculated as a function of driving frequency is the exact dilution `` factor '' .",
    "moreover , this ratio can be calculated as a function of frequency , and then we get the different dilution factors for all the modes in the system . this is an important lesson that also we will use more extensively in suspensions with more coupled degrees of freedom .",
    "we now consider an extended mass instead of a point mass , with a single generic dissipative energy source .",
    "the pendulum motion is described with the horizontal displacement of its center of mass @xmath31 , and the pitch angle of the mass , @xmath111 , as in the side view of a ligo test mass , in fig.[pendulum ] .",
    "the kinetic energy is @xmath112 . instead of a spring constant",
    ", we have a 2x2 spring _",
    "matrix_. the potential energy is @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath111 are the normal coordinates .",
    "the point @xmath115 is the point where the wire is attached to the mirror , and the angle @xmath116 is the angle the wire makes with the vertical . if we only consider gravitational forces , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "however , we will assume that the elements of the spring matrix can be complex , and each has its own different imaginary part .",
    "the eigenfrequencies are the solutions to the equation @xmath119 , or @xmath120 in order to calculate @xmath121 ( the brownian motion of the center of mass ) , we need to calculate the admittance @xmath122 to a horizontal force applied at the center of mass . in order to calculate @xmath123 , we need the admittance @xmath124 to a torque applied around the pitch axis .",
    "if the spring constants are complex , then the admittances are complex and we can calculate their real parts , and the thermal noise determined by them : @xmath125\\ ] ] @xmath126\\ ] ] where the eigenfrequencies are now complex : @xmath127 .",
    "the quality factors measurable from the free decay of each of the eigenfrequencies are @xmath128 .    at frequencies larger than any of the eigenfrequencies ,",
    "we obtain @xmath129    the system may have the two eigenfrequencies close in value if @xmath130 ( see fig.[wpmqpm ] ) , but for @xmath131 , we have @xmath132 and @xmath133 ; and for @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 . in both limits ,",
    "two terms cancel in the sum of loss factors in the formulas above ( @xmath137 for small @xmath138 , for example ) and we see that    @xmath139    thus , even though it is a coupled system , thermal noise in @xmath31 is always associated mostly to @xmath140 and the pendulum eigenfrequency @xmath141 ; and thermal noise in @xmath111 is always associated with @xmath142 and the pitch eigenfrequency @xmath143 . for both degrees of freedom @xmath31 and @xmath111 , we obtain the thermal noise of single - dof systems . unfortunately ,",
    "neither limit ( small or large @xmath138 with respect to @xmath144 ) applies to the suspension parameters in ligo test masses , and , more importantly , even though the approximation for the eigenfrequencies is relatively good for most values of @xmath138 , the approximation we used for the losses is not ( fig.[wpmqpm ] ) .",
    "the measurable quality factors give us @xmath145 , but we need @xmath146 and @xmath147 to use in the thermal noise of the pendulum , and these can not be precisely calculated from @xmath145 unless we know @xmath148 , or a way to relate it to the other loss factors .",
    "we will do this in the next section , using the elasticity of the wire .",
    "notice that the forces and torques we have used to calculate the admittances @xmath149 and @xmath150 , will each produce _ both _ displacement and rotation of the pendulum .",
    "this means that the thermal noise in displacement and angle are * not * uncorrelated .",
    "this can be exploited to find a point other than the center of mass where the laser beam in the interferometer would be sensing less displacement thermal noise than at the center of the mirror , as was done following a somewhat different logic in @xcite . if we were to calculate the thermal noise at a point a distance @xmath151 above the center of mass , we then need to calculate the admittance of the velocity of that point ( @xmath152 ) to a horizontal force applied at that point .",

    "there is an optimal distance @xmath151 below the center of mass for which the thermal noise @xmath159 is a minimum : this distance is @xmath160 .",
    "the resulting thermal noise is @xmath161 which is _ less _ than the thermal noise @xmath121 observed at the center of mass .",
    "however , the expression obtained for the distance @xmath151 is frequency - dependent : that means we have to choose a frequency at which to optimize the sampling point .    summarizing",
    ", we have shown that whenever there are coupled motions , the thermal noise sensed at a point whose position depends on both coordinates is _ not _ the sum in quadrature of the two thermal noise ( @xmath162 and @xmath163 in our case ) , but a combination that depends on the `` cross - admittance '' . moreover ,",
    "the thermal noise of each degree of freedom can not in general be calculated just from the measured quality factors if the modes are coupled to each other strongly enough .",
    "we add to the previous 2-dof pendulum a continuum wire , to be able to add the losses due to the wire s elasticity , and calculate modal and effective quality factors , as well as the point on the mirror at which we can sense the minimum thermal noise .    if we add elasticity to the problem , as in @xcite , the potential energy is @xmath164 .",
    "the boundary conditions for the wire equation are @xmath165 , and @xmath166 .",
    "the equations of motion for the pendulum are    @xmath167    in order to complete the equations of motion of the pendulum , we need the shape of the wire at the bottom end . for this",

    "the analytical expressions for the admittances are quite involved , but we can always calculate numerically the thermal noise associated with any set of parameters .",
    "we can also calculate the widths of the peaks in the admittance , which would correspond to measurable quality factors for the pendulum , pitch , and violin modes .",
    "the plots presented in figs . [ wpmqpm ] and [ thnsasds ] were calculated using these solutions .",
    "fig.[wpmqpm ] shows that the frequency and quality factor of the pendulum and pitch modes vary significantly with the pitch distance @xmath138 . at frequencies close to the pendulum eigenfrequencies ,",
    "the thermal noise spectral densities show peaks at both frequencies . however , at higher frequencies , the thermal noise @xmath121 can always be approximated by the thermal noise of a simple oscilaltor as in eqn.[simpleosc ] , with an `` effective '' quality factor that fits the amplitude at high frequencies to the position of the single peak .",
    "we can similarly define an effective quality factor for the thermal noise in @xmath123 .",
    "we show in fig.[thnsasds ] the actual and approximated thermal noise , with their corresponding effective quality factors found to fit best at 50 hz .",
    "the effective quality factor at 50 hz can be calculated as a function of pitch distance , and we show this calculation in fig . [ wpmqpm ] .",
    "the effective pitch quality factor is well approximated , for any pitch distance , by the measurable pitch quality factor , while the pendulum effective quality factor is close to the measurable quality factor of the pendulum mode only at very small , or very large pitch distances .",
    "for the ligo pitch distance of 8 mm , the measurable pendulum quality factor is 10 times lower than the effective quality factor , and would then give a pessimistic estimate of thermal noise amplitude .",

    "we would like to break up this potential energy into a gravitational part and an elastic part , corresponding to a real gravitational spring constant ( independent of @xmath88 ) and a lossy elastic spring constant .",
    "we know that if we take the limit @xmath73 in @xmath184 , we obtain the regular potential energy @xmath185 in eq.[pe2dof ] for a 2 dof pendulum without elasticity .",
    "thus , we are tempted to say that the elastic energy is the remainder , proportional to @xmath88 , and thus having a complex spring constant when we consider a complex @xmath88 . according to this argument",

    "the gravitational potential energy has also a term @xmath193 : we define a ratio @xmath194 , indicating the relative contribution of this `` pitch '' term . from fig.[cumulativeenergies ]",
    ", we observe that the gravitational potential energy density is distributed quite homogenously along the wire , even at the first violin mode .",
    "however , the pitch term , which can be considered a `` bottom '' contribution , contributes most of the gravitational energy when the system is excited at the pitch eigenfrequency , but also in several other cases at the pendulum frequency and at low frequencies .",
    "the elastic energy density is concentrated at top and bottom portions of length  @xmath195 . at low frequencies",
    ", the top contributes the most ; at the pendulum eigenfrequency , the relative contributions depend strongly on @xmath138 , but the bottom contributes at least half the energy ; at the pitch eigenfrequency , the bottom contributes more than 99% of the energy ; at higher frequencies , including the violin modes , top and bottom contribute equally .",

    "the cross admittance in eq.[chi2 ] is @xmath196 and then the optimal point ( otimized at frequencies in the gravitational wave band , above pendulum modes ) is @xmath197 .",
    "notice that even though the optimal distance was deduced from the thermal noise expressions , which all involve loss factors , the optimal distance only depends on mechanical parameters . as first explained in @xcite , the interpretation of this distance is that when the pendulum is pushed at that point by a horizontal force , the wire does nt bend at the bottom clamp , producing less losses .",
    "the fact that we can recover the result from the fdt is another manifestation of the deep relationship between thermal fluctuations and energy dissipation .",
    "we show in fig[dmin ] the dependence of the thermal noise at 50 hz on the point probed by the laser beam on the mirror , and the ratio of the thermal noise for @xmath198 and @xmath199 at all frequencies .",
    "as expected , since the integrated rms has to be the the same for any distance at which we sense the motion , the fact that the spectral density is smaller at 50 hz if @xmath199 means that the noise will be increased at some other frequencies : this happens mainly at frequencies below the pendulum modes .",
    "there are many lessons to be learned from this exercise , but perhaps the most important one is that the explicit solutions to the equations of motion have many different important results :    * using the solutions to calculate the elastic and gravitational potential energies allows us to calculate a `` dilution function '' of frequency , equal to the dilution factor at _ each _ of the resonant modes of the system , as well as to the most important effective dilution factor at frequencies in the gravitational wave band ; * we can calculate energy densities along the wire to identify the portions of the wire most responsible for the energy loss and thus the thermal noise ; * we can use low frequency approximations to find out expressions for dilution factors that can be found using other methods , explaining in this way subtleties like factors of two ; * we can calculate the admittance of an arbitrary point in the mirror surface to the driving force , and thus find out improvements or degradation of observed noise due to beam misalignments .",
    "we will now calculate the solutions to the equations of motion for the six degrees of freedom of a ligo suspended test mass , and then use the solutions to calculate the thermal nosie of all degrees of freedom , as well as the observed tehrmal noise in the gravitational wave detector .",
    "the mirrors at ligo are suspended by a single wire looping around the cylindrical mass , attached at the top at a distance smaller than the mirror diameter , to provide a low yaw eigenfrequency .",
    "this is equivalent to having a mass suspended by two wires , attached slightly above the horizontal plane where the center of mass is .",

    "however , since @xmath249 decreases the gravitational restoring force but not the elastic force , the dilution factor @xmath250 increases , and so does the thermal noise . at frequencies where @xmath46 , @xmath251 . the thermal noise at frequencies below the violin modes , where @xmath46 , is well approximated by the thermal noise of a single oscillator with resonance frequency @xmath252 and quality factor @xmath253 , where @xmath254 .",

    "the pendulum thermal noise could be reduced by a factor @xmath287 , or about 40% , if the beam spot was positioned at the optimal position on the mirror .",

    "the restoring force is elastic and proportional to @xmath30 , so there is no dilution factor .",
    "the term added because of the wire tilting is a gravitational restoring force , much smaller than the elastic restoring force . since it is also mostly real when considering a complex young modulus @xmath30 , it will not change significatively the loss terms , and thus the thermal noise .",

    "this is due to the lower quality factor , and the higher mode frequency .",

    "the contribution due to vertical thermal noise is 10% of the pendulum thermal noise . in advanced detectors ,",
    "vertical modes are going to be at lower frequencies due to soft vertical supports , like in the suspensions used in the geo600 interferometer , but the ratio of quality factors is just the mechanical dilution factor , so the contribution of vertical thermal noise to sensed motion will be of order @xmath320 , not necessarily a small number !",

    "if the wires are perfectly straight , the thermal noise of the side - to - side pendulum motion below the violin modes @xmath328 is well approximated by that of a simple oscillator with eigenfrequency @xmath329 and a dilution factor @xmath106 .",

    "for any small wire tilt , however , the spring constant @xmath332 in eqn.[kyy ] has a large contribution of @xmath333 , and thus the fluctuations increase as @xmath334 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ sideroll ] .",
    "since the roll eigenfrequency is higher than the side pendulum eigenfrequency , and its quality factor is lower , this is a significant increase in the thermal noise spectral density @xmath330 , about a factor of 100 for ligo parameters .",
    "however , the gravitationalw ave detectors are mostly immune to the roll degree of freedom , as we will see later .    also , the tilting of the wires introduces violin modes harmonics of @xmath3356khz apart from the usual harmonics @xmath336hz .",
    "the violin modes that are most visible in the roll thermal noise are the harmonics of @xmath337 ( and are strictly the only ones present if the wires are not tilted ) .",
    "we have explored the relationship between quality factors of pendulum modes and the `` effective '' quality factor needed to predict the thermal noise of any given degree of freedom ( seen only in sensitive interferometers ) . for the most important longitudinal motion ,",
    "we ve seen that the effective quality factor is approximately equal to @xmath338 , where @xmath339 is the quality factor of the free wire , related to the imaginary part of the young modulus . under ideal conditions where the pendulum mode is far away from the pitch mode in frequency ,",
    "its quality factor is close to the effective quality factor , but as we have seen , the errors may be as large as 50% .",
    "the violin modes , approximately equal to @xmath340 , appear in the horizontal motion of the pendulum in both directions , along the optical axis and transverse to it .",
    "the violin modes show some anharmonicity , as pointed in @xcite , with the frequencies slightly higher than @xmath341 , and the quality factors degrading with mode number .",
    "the complex eigenfrequencies are the solutions to the equation @xmath342 with @xmath311 .",
    "this means that if we measure the quality factors of violin modes , and they follow the predicted anharmonic behavior in both directions , we can assume the losses are only limited by wire losses .",
    "we can then predict the thermal noise in the gravitational wave band with more confidence , having also consistency checks with the quality factors measured at the pendulum modes .",
    "the thermal amplitude of the peaks at the violin modes follows a simple @xmath343 law , corrected by the change in longitudinal qs .",
    "we show all these features in fig.[violinmodes ] .      the right way to calculate the total thermal noise observed in the interferometer signal is to calculate the pendulum response to an applied oscillating force in the direction of the laser beam .",
    "the pendulum responds to a force in all its six degrees of freedom , but the motion we are sensitive to is the motion projected on the laser beam s direction .",
    "if the laser beam is horizontal , and its direction passes through the mirror center of mass , it will be sensitive to only longitudinal displacement and pitch motion . if the beam is not horizontal , and for example is tilted up or down by an angle @xmath266 , ( but still going through the center of mass )",
    ", we imagine an applied force @xmath42 applied in the beam s direction , with a horizontal component @xmath344 and a vertical component @xmath345 .",
    "the motion we are interested in is @xmath346 , since it is the direction sensed by the laser beam .",
    "the admittance we need to calculate is then @xmath347 , where @xmath149 is the response of the horizontal displacement to a horizontal force and @xmath348 is the vertical response to a vertical force .",
    "a force applied in the beam s direction , with magnitude @xmath349 , will have components in all 3 axes , and torques around all 3 axes too : @xmath350 and @xmath351 .",
    "the motion we are interested is , in general , @xmath352 .",
    "if the motion in all 6-dof was uncoupled , then each dof responds to just one component of the force or the torque , and the admittance we need would be just the sum of the admittances , each weighted by the square of a factor @xmath353 or a distance @xmath354 .",
    "however , only @xmath201 and @xmath14 are decoupled dof from the rest , and @xmath355 and @xmath321 form two coupled systems , for which we need to solve the response to a forces and torques together .",
    "we define an admittance @xmath356 as the admittance of displacement @xmath31 to an applied torque @xmath303 , and @xmath357 as the admittance of pitch to an applied horizontal force , and similar quantities @xmath358 . then , the total thermal noise sensed by the laser beam is @xmath359 or @xmath360 so it is a weighted sum in quadrature of the thermal noise of different degrees of freedom , plus some cross - terms .",
    "these terms may be negative , so it is possible to choose an optimal set of parameters to minimize the sensed motion , as shown in @xcite . the weighting factors and distances are @xmath361    typical distances @xmath362 are few mm at most , and typical angles @xmath363are in the order of microradians , since an angle of such magnitude produces displacements of the order of millimeters at the beam at the other end of the arm , 4 km away .",
    "however , the angle @xmath364 can not be less than half the arm length divided by the curvature of earth , or @xmath365 .",
    "we show in fig[finalplot ] the thermal noise sensed by a beam with @xmath366 mm , @xmath367 and @xmath368rad .",
    "we have shown several general results , and then calculated predicted thermal motions for ligo suspensions .",
    "first , we showed that if there is a single oscillator with two sources of potential energy , one with a spring constant @xmath26 and a dominant real part , and the other with a complex spring constant @xmath29 , with a dominant loss factor , then the dilution factor @xmath25 gives us the ratio between the oscillator s quality factor ( determining its thermal noise spectral density ) and the loss factor of @xmath29 .",
    "however , the elastic loss @xmath369 might itself have a small dilution factor with respect to the loss factor of the young modulus , for example if @xmath370 , then there is a dilution factor of 1/2 .    we also show that when two or more degrees of freedom are coupled , the measurable quality factors at resonance may not be as useful to predict the `` effective '' quality factor used in the thermal noise spectral density , unless the eigenfrequencies are far from each other .",
    "we showed that by using approximations of order @xmath67 , we can easily obtain wire shapes and equations of motion for the 6 degrees of freedom of the mirror , as a function of applied oscillating forces and torques .",
    "we think that this method will be most useful when applied to multiple pendulum systems such as those used in geo600 and planned for advanced ligo detectors @xcite .",
    "however , even in the simple pendulum case this approach allows us to calculate the gravitational and elastic potential energy as a linear energy density along the wire , and the total energy .",
    "we showed that , for an applied horizontal force , the gravitational potential energy ( @xmath371 ) is homogeneously distributed along the wires , while the elastic potential energy ( @xmath372 ) is concentrated at the top and bottom , but in different proportions depending on the frequency of the applied force ( fig .",
    "[ cumulativeenergies ] .",
    "we also calculate the ratio of total elastic potential energy to gravitational energy using the solutions for the wire shape , and show that this function of frequency corresponds to the dilution factor for the eigenmode loss factors _ as well _ as for the effective quality factor that allows us to calculate the thermal noise at gravitational wave frequencies ( see figs.[ptmass],[energyratios],[yawdilutionfactor ] ) .    applying our calculation of wire shapes and equations of motion that include elasticity to ligo suspensions , we show in figs [ disptn ] and [ angtn ] the resulting spectral densities of displacement and angular degrees of freedom of the mirror .",
    "more importantly , we show in fig[finalplot ] the resulting contribution of pendulum thermal noise to the ligo sensitivity curve , assuming small misalignments in the sensing laser beam ( 5 mm away from center of mass , 1@xmath274rad away from horizontal ) . as expected , the displacement degree of freedom is the one that dominates the contribution , but pitch noise contributes significantly ( 29% at 100 hz ) if the beam is 5 mm above center .",
    "but this is not added in quadrature to the horizontal noise , which makes 81% : the coupled displacement - pitch thermal motion makes up 99% of the total thermal noise .",
    "a misplacement _ below _ the center of mass will _ reduce _ the observed thermal noise , as first noted in @xcite .",
    "the contribution of yaw thermal noise ( 11% at 100hz ) is smaller than that of pitch , but very comparable .",
    "the contribution of vertical noise due to the 4 km length of the interferometer is 8% at 100 hz .",
    "the side and roll motions are coupled , but the roll contribution dominates ( due to the large angle @xmath364 and the assumed @xmath373 mm ) and is 0.7% , much smaller than the contributions of pitch , yaw and vertical degrees of freedom . when added in quadrature , the total thermal noise is 23% higher than the contribution of just the horizontal thermal noise . however ,",
    "if the vertical misplacement of the beam is 5 mm below the center of mass , instead of above , the total contribution of thermal noise is 89% of the horizontal thermal noise of the center mass .",
