    "the recurrent novae ( rne ) form a small , but heterogeneous group of cataclysmic variable stars that undergo classical nova - like outbursts , reaching luminosities @xmath1 , at intervals of the order of decades .",
    "the nova outbursts are accompanied by the ejection of matter at velocities @xmath2  km  s@xmath3 . some rne ( u scorpii , v394 coronae australis , lmc 1990 no .  2 , t pyxidis ) are short period binaries similar to the classical novae and consist of a white dwarf and a dwarf secondary . in contrast ,",
    "the other members of this group ( rs ophiuchi , t coronae borealis , v745 scorpii , v3890 sagittarii ) are long period binaries , with periods of the order of several hundred days , and consist of a hot white dwarf and a red giant like the symbiotic binary systems .",
    "the nova outbursts in rne is thought to be powered by a thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) in the accreted layer formed on the white dwarf following accretion of mass from the companion ( starrfield et al 1985 ; kato 1990 ; kato 1991 ) .",
    "the outburst properties of the rne with giant secondaries are quite homogeneous .",
    "they are fast novae with a rate of decline of @xmath4  mag / day .",
    "the outburst spectrum is characterized by broad emission lines ( @xmath5  km s@xmath3 ) , which narrow with time , presence of intense coronal lines and other high excitation lines .",
    "the 1985 outburst of rs oph was one of the best studied events , with the outburst being recorded from x - rays to radio wavelengths ( see rosino 1987 for a review on the outbursts of rs oph ) .",
    "the coronal lines , x - ray and the radio emission arise in a region heated by the shock interaction of the fast moving dense nova ejecta with the pre - outburst slow moving red giant stellar wind .",
    "some of the parameters of these systems are listed in table 1 .",

    ", the other objects also have lines due to feii and caii .",
    "heii lines are either extremely weak or absent .",
    "van winckel et al ( 1993 ) classify these systems as belonging to the symbiotic type s3 , i.e.  stars with a slow , very dense wind , leading to a deep central reversal of the h@xmath12 emission line .",
    "only t crb and rs oph have been observed in the ultraviolet ( uv ) using the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) .",
    "the uv spectra of t crb show a complex structure with emission lines and shell - like absorption features superposed over a relatively hot continuum ( selvelli et al 1992 ) .",
    "the uv spectra of rs oph show a flat continuum with a few weak emission lines like ciii 3130 , niii ] 1750 and civ 1550 ( dobrzycka et al 1996a ) .",
    "the uv continuum as well as the emission line fluxes are variable in both the objects , and are strongly correlated .",
    "variability in the @xmath0/visual magnitudes , and the optical emission lines has also been reported ( e.g.  kenyon & garcia 1986 ; iijima 1990 ; iijima et al 1994 ; anupama & prabhu 1991 ; anupama 1997 ; dobrzycka et al 1996a ) .",
    "the binary nature of t crb was first established by sanford ( 1949 ) , and later by kraft ( 1958 ) who refined sanford s period estimate to 227.6 days , derived a total mass of the system of 5  , and a mass ratio of 1.4 with the giant being the more massive component .",
    "kenyon & garcia ( 1986 ) obtained new radial velocity data for the giant and combining with the data of sanford and kraft , obtained a new orbital solution and confirmed the previous estimates for the component masses .",
    "these results suggested the hot component has a mass exceeding the chandrasekhar limit and hence must be a main sequence star , and posed a serious problem for the thermonuclear runaway model for the nova outbursts requiring a massive white dwarf .",
    "recently , belczyski & mikoajewska ( 1998 ) have reanalyzed the photometric and radial velocity data and arrived at new parameters for the binary components .",
    "their analysis shows the mass ratio of t crb @xmath13 with stellar masses @xmath14  for the red giant and @xmath15  for the hot companion , compatible with a white dwarf mass .",
    "this is also in agreement with the uv characteristics of the hot component which are easily explained by the presence of a white dwarf acceptor ( selvelli et al 1992 ) .",
    "garcia ( 1986 ) found the radial velocity of the absorption features in the shell type profiles of the feii lines in rs oph varied in a range from @xmath16  km s@xmath3 to @xmath17  km s@xmath3 with a period of about 230 days .",
    "dobrzycka & kenyon ( 1994 ) recently reanalyzed the orbital period for rs oph and found the system has a spectroscopic orbit of period 460 days .",
    "assuming the hot component to be a massive white dwarf , they estimated rs oph to be a low mass system , with low inclination , quite similar to t crb .",
    "the nature of the hot component in this system , however , still remains a bit of a mystery .",
    "following the decline from the 1985 outburst , the temperature and luminosity of the central ionizing source as inferred from the optical and x - ray spectra ( anupama & prabhu 1989 ; mason et al 1987 ) , t@xmath18  k ; l@xmath19 erg s@xmath3 , were consistent with the remnant residual hydrogen burning on top of a white dwarf with a thin atmosphere following the tnr outburst .",
    "the recent rosat detection of rs oph at quiescence ( orio 1993 ) however , implies a soft x - ray luminosity @xmath20 . recently , dobrzycka et al ( 1996a ) analyzed the quiescent optical and uv spectra and estimated the hot star has a luminosity of @xmath21  and the spectrum mimics that of a b - type shell star .",
    "the absence of heii lines in the spectra together with the presence of hei lines led them to estimate the temperature of the source to be @xmath22  k. they also found that although the hot component luminosity is consistent with the high accretion rate , @xmath23  , needed for recurrent nova eruptions , the effective temperature and luminosity place the hot component far from standard massive white dwarf tracks in the hr diagram .    in this work",
    ", the behaviour of these systems at quiescence is studied .",
    "the observed spectral features of the hot component are interpreted in terms of an accreting white dwarf embedded in an envelope of wind from the giant secondary .",

    "this effect is more pronounced in the @xmath29 and @xmath28 bands , while in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands it is superposed upon secular changes .",
    "the @xmath31 light curve is dominated by the secular changes , as well as some erratic variations , which can be attributed to the hot component .",
    "the optical emission line fluxes vary considerably during the period covered by our observations ( table 3 ) . similar variability has been previously observed ( e.g. andrillat & houziaux 1982 ; kenyon & garcia 1986 ; iijima 1990 ; anupama & prabhu 1991 ; anupama 1997 ) . anupama ( 1997 ) also reports long - term periodicities in the optical emission line variation .",
    "t crb was in a high state in 1987 with the emission lines being very bright , followed by a low state in the early 1990 s , when only the balmer h@xmath12 and h@xmath27 lines were weakly present .",
    "the emission line strengths increased once again in 1996 , accompanied by significant brightening of the optical continuum .",
    "figure 5 ( top panel ) shows our h@xmath12 and h@xmath27 line fluxes together with those published plotted against the @xmath29 magnitude .",
    "the correlation between the line strengths and the @xmath29 magnitude is evident .",
    "iijima ( 1990 ) found a similar behaviour of the h@xmath27 flux with the @xmath30 magnitude .",
    "the quiescent @xmath29 light curve of t crb is dominated by the ellipsoidal changes of the cool giant . to estimate the @xmath29 magnitude of the hot component , @xmath32 , we have subtracted the contribution of the m giant to the observed @xmath29 magnitudes of t crb using the synthetic ellipsoidal light curve for the m giant computed by belczyski & mikoajewska ( 1998 ) .",
    "the strong correlation of the emission line fluxes with so estimated @xmath32 ( bottom panel of figure 5 ) indicates that the hot component activity is responsible for the optical emission line changes .",
    "the enhancement in the line fluxes in the optical are also correlated with the activity in the uv .",
    "for example , the fluxes in the uv and the optical emission lines were low in 1981 ( williams 1983 , blair et al 1983 , selvelli et al 1992 ) , while the high state observed in the optical in 1987 coincides with the enhancement seen in the june 1987 uv spectrum . during the period 19821990 , luthardt ( 1992 ) found the variations in the mean @xmath31 brightness by more than 2.5  mag , while the variations in the @xmath30 and @xmath29 band were , respectively , about 1  mag and 0.3  mag .",
    "the variation in the @xmath31 band is strongly correlated with the variation observed in the uv flux during the same period .",
    "it is thus quite evident that the optical enhancements seen in t crb are associated with the hot component .",
    "we will discuss later as to the possible causes of the activity .",
    "the visual magnitude of rs ophiuchi is found to vary between 1112 magnitude , with occasional rises to @xmath33 magnitude .",
    "the spectra presented in figure 2 and the fluxes listed in table 4 , indicate that the optical emission lines are also variable .",
    "variability in the uv flux has also been reported ( dobrzycka et al 1996a , shore et al 1996 ) .",
    "figure 6 presents our h@xmath27 and h@xmath12 flux estimates together with published data plotted against the continuum magnitude at 5500 @xmath34 , @xmath25 , dependence of the balmer line ratios on @xmath25 , and the @xmath35 ( from shore et al 1996 ) vs. @xmath36 .",
    "the figure shows that the emission line flux variability is strongly correlated with the activity of the hot component as in the case of t crb .",
    "although the data available in the uv are few , there is also an indication of a correlation between the optical and uv flux .",
    "broad emission components in the emission lines of hi and hei were detected by iijima et al ( 1994 ) during 1991 and 1992 .",
    "these broad components are present in the h@xmath27 and h@xmath12 lines in some of our spectra ( see figure 2 ) at velocities of the order of @xmath37  km s@xmath3 .",
    "the wavelength , profile and intensity of these components are found to be strongly variable with a time scale of days ( iijima et al 1994 ) .",
    "iijima et al also detect heii 4686 at an intensity of about 8% of h@xmath27 on 1991 oct 2 and suggest the possibility of a relation between the presence of this line and the intensity of the broad components .",
    "they also suggest that the broad components arise in a region close to the surface of the hot component , a white dwarf .",
    "similar to rs oph and t crb , v3890 sgr also shows activity at quiescence , as depicted by the recent rise to @xmath38  mag in may 1997 .",
    "the spectrum of 1997 ( figure 3 ) was obtained when v3890 sgr was in a high state at a visual magnitude of 15 mag .",
    "the emission lines are stronger in 1997 as compared to 1998 ( figure 3 ; also table 5 ) . comparing the spectra presented here with that of williams ( 1983 ) obtained in 1981",
    ", it appears that this system was in a high state also in 1981 .",
    "the emission lines were very strong and the ionization level was higher than that indicated by the 1997 and 1998 spectra .",
    "for example , heii 4686    was present with a strength @xmath39% that of h@xmath27 in 1981 , while it is barely detected in 1997 and absent in 1998 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the heii 4686 line was quite strong in the spectra presented by williams et al ( 1994 ) obtained 12 years after the 1990 outburst .",
    "figure 4 shows the spectrum of v745 sco obtained in march 1998 .",
    "although the blue region of the spectrum is very noisy , the lines due to h@xmath27 , feii and hei 5876 can be easily identified .",
    "we are unable to say anything about activity in this nova owing to inadequate data .",
    "however , we expect its behaviour to be similar to that of the other members in the group",
    ".      rapid photometric variations with amplitudes of 0.011.0 magnitude over timescales of minutes have been observed in both t crb and rs oph .",
    "the amplitude of flickering in t crb is maximum in the @xmath31 band with @xmath40 magnitude on timescales of minutes ( walker 1957 ; ianna 1964 ; lawerence et al 1967 ; bianchini & middleditch 1976 ; walker 1977 ; bruch 1980 ; oskanian 1983 ) .",
    "the amplitude is smaller in @xmath30 , @xmath41 mag , and generally undetectable in the @xmath42 bands ( raikova & antov 1986 ; lines et al 1988 ; bruch 1992 ; mikoajewski et al 1997 ) . on some occasions",
    ", there is no flickering detected at all wavelengths ( bianchini & middleditch 1976 ; oskanian 1983 ; dobrzycka et al 1996b ; mikoajewski et al 1997 ) .",
    "the absence of flickering in the longer wavelength bands dominated by flux from the cool component indicates these rapid fluctuations are associated with the hot component .",
    "we have looked for correlation of flickering with the activity of the hot component .",
    "flickering is generally absent when the system is in a low state and usually present when the system is in a high state .",
    "in particular , t crb was is in a relatively high state during most of 1981 - 86 period ( e.g. fig . 1 of belczyski & mikoajewska 1998 ) , when various observers detected flickering in the @xmath31 , @xmath30 and occasionally even in the @xmath29 light ( oskanian 1983 ; lines et al 1988 ; bruch 1992 ; raikova & antov 1986 ) with amplitudes up to 0.6 mag in @xmath31 .",
    "the flickering activity however disappeared in june 1982 , following a significant decline in @xmath0 magnitudes ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "similarly , the absence of flickering in june 1993 ( dobrzycka et al 1996b ) coincided with a general drop in the @xmath0 as well as iue fluxes after c. jd 2447000 ( luthardt 1992 ; selvelli et al . 1992",
    "; belczyski & mikoajewska 1998 ) .",
    "this low state prevailed until spring 1996 ; flickering reappeared in april 1996 , when t crb brightened significantly , and was generally present when the star remained blue ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ; fig . 1 of mikoajewski et al 1997 ) .",
    "the presence or absence of flickering does not show any correlation with the orbital phase .",
    "it is however , evident that flickering is correlated with the activity of the hot component .",
    "the observations of flickering activity in rs oph are few .",
    "however , all observations show a consistent flickering activity with amplitudes of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( walker 1957 ; walker 1977 ; bruch 1980 , 1992 ; dobrzycka et al 1996b ) over timescales of minutes .",
    "we must however note that all observations were made when the star was relatively bright ( @xmath50 ) and blue ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the flickering activity detected in both t crb and rs oph is very similar to that observed in dwarf novae and other cataclysmic variables containing accreting white dwarfs , and provides very strong evidence for the presence of accreting white dwarfs in these recurrent nova systems also .",

    "rs oph spectra obtained in 1998 , we use the ratio @xmath65 instead of @xmath63 as the region around 4000    in these data is noisy and the fluxes inaccurate . since the flux ratios for a composite system lie on a straight line connecting flux ratios for the individual components , the relative lengths of the line segments give the fractional contribution of each component at the common wavelength , 5500    ( wade 1982 ; dobrzycka et al 1996a ) .",

    "the results obtained for rs oph ( table 8) suggest that the on jd2450559 the visual brightness of both the giant and the hot components was lower than usually .",
    "in fact , the [ tio ] indices ( table 7 ) indicate a somewhat earlier spectral type for the giant than usually , possibly due to enhanced veiling by the hot component continuum , while the emission line fluxes ( table 4 ) are consistent with the rather low luminosity of the hot component .",

    "the value of the ly@xmath27 intensity obtained is a lower limit as the theoretical calculations are for the optically thin case while the line emitting region is optically thick as seen from the balmer line ratios in these objects .",
    "although current thoughts favor a thermonuclear runaway on a massive white dwarf as the energy source for recurrent novae , there is a considerable debate in the literature about the nature of the hot component in t crb . basing on a rather controversial estimate of the hot component mass above the chandrasekhar limit ( kraft 1958 ; kenyon & garcia 1986 ) , webbink et al ( 1987 ) and canizzo & kenyon ( 1992 ) interpreted the nova - like outbursts of t crb in terms of transient phenomena in a non - stationary accretion disc around a main sequence star .",
    "unfortunately , as demonstrated by selvelli et al ( 1992 ) most observational data for t crb are against the accretion model .",
    "in particular , they showed that the quiescent uv characteristics of t crb provide direct observational evidence for the presence of a white dwarf accreting at rates @xmath92  .",
    "moreover , recent analyses of the ellipsoidal variations of the m giant and the radial velocity data by belczyski & mikoajewska ( 1998 ) show that the system is a low mass binary system with stellar masses @xmath93  for the giant and @xmath94  for the hot component , and solve practically all controversies about the nature of the hot component and the physical causes of its eruptions .    the recent outbursts of rs oph , v3890 sgr and v745 sco , respectively , in 1985 , 1990 and 1989 , indicate the outburst luminosity was @xmath95 for a 1.2  white dwarf as predicted by tnr outburst models . in general , various outburst phenomena in these systems can be easily explained by the tnr models ( see e.g.  anupama 1995 ) .",
    "the amplitude and timescales of flickering detected during quiescence in t crb and rs oph , are very similar to the flickering found in other cataclysmic variables , and clearly point to the presence of an accreting white dwarf .",
    "the quiescent uv - optical spectrum of rs oph on the other hand does not exhibit the high ionization lines generally seen in the spectra of cataclysmic variables , and occasionally also seen in t crb .",
    "the high ionization emission lines are also absent in the optical spectra of t crb , rs oph , v3890 sgr and v745 sco analyzed in this paper .",
    "the major problem for the tnr model is however the inconsistency of the hot component s luminosity and effective temperature ( sec .",
    "3.4 ; also dobrzycka et al 1996a ) with standard massive white dwarf tracks in the hr diagram .",
    "this seems to be an intrinsic feature of all four recurrent novae discussed in our paper .",
    "a possible explanation of this behaviour could be as follows .",
    "the hot component in symbiotic systems is embedded in the red giant wind . in a majority of systems",
    "the hot component luminosity is high enough to ionize a significant portion of the red giant wind giving rise to both strong uv and strong optical emission lines . in particular , studies of samples of symbiotic systems in the radio and optical range ( e.g. seaquist & taylor 1990",
    "; mikoajewska et al 1997 ) , as well as numerical simulations of raman scattered ovi emission lines ( schmid 1996 ) suggest that symbiotic systems have preferentially an ionization geometry with an _ x_-parameter ( as defined by seaquist et al 1984 ) , @xmath96 , which means that the ` average shape ' of the ionization front does not differ significantly from the plane between the two stellar components .",
    "however , in the case when the wind is very strong or / and the hot component luminosity is relatively low , only a small region of the wind around the hot companion is ionized and most of the emission emerging from this region can be absorbed in the enveloping neutral wind .",
    "shore & aufdenberg ( 1993 ) , on the basis of an analysis of the ultraviolet spectra of several symbiotic systems , have shown that the emission lines could be severely affected by differential extinction due to absorption lines in the red giant wind produced by neutral and singly ionized iron peak elements .",
    "the effect of this `` iron curtain '' is to lower the ultraviolet continuum temperatures and also suppress the emission lines at sufficiently high column densities ( @xmath97  @xmath89 ) .",
    "shore & aufdenberg also point out that the absence of emission lines does not rule out the existence of an accretion disc around the hot component .",
    "shore & aufdenberg ( 1993 ) and shore et al ( 1996 ) have argued that the differential line absorption by the cool giant environment can account for the shape and variability of uv spectra of rs oph and t crb .",
    "the presence of feii emission lines in the optical region indicates that line blanketing by the `` iron curtain '' is indeed possible .",
    "the ratio of the feii and the caii infrared triplet lines in rs oph is similar to the ratios observed in active galactic nuclei ( joly 1989 ) , and indicate electron densities of @xmath98  @xmath85 and column density @xmath99  @xmath89 .",
    "the balmer line ratios indicate high optical depth in the line emitting region . the oi 8446/7774 line ratio in rs oph and v3890 sgr clearly indicate enhancement of the 8446    line by ly@xmath27 fluorescence .",
    "further , these ratios also imply a mean ly@xmath27 radiation density @xmath100  erg @xmath89 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 .",
    "this implies the presence of a hot uv source hidden within the optically thick wind envelope .",
    "the euv luminosity of the hot component estimated using the observed hydrogen and helium emission line fluxes is , as shown in section 3.4 , higher than the luminosities observed in normal stars of the estimated spectral type .",
    "this is consistent with the hot source being embedded within the wind envelope .",
    "the estimated spectral type of hot component is hence not a true representation of the flux from the hot source and does not exclude the presence of a @xmath101  k white dwarf .",
    "thus the temperature and radius estimated by dobrzycka et al ( 1996a ) for the hot component in rs oph correspond to the pseudophotosphere of the wind envelope .",
    "the absence of high ionization lines can be accounted for by the absorption and softening by reradiation of all direct photons from the white dwarf+accretion disc .",
    "it may be noted that heii 4686    line has been clearly detected in rs oph in the spectrum of 1991 october ( iijima et al 1994 ) , indicating the presence of a @xmath102  k ionizing source .",
    "it is interesting to note that the visual magnitude was low ( @xmath103 mag ) during this period .",
    "we will return to this problem in the next section .",
    "the 4686    line was also clearly present in the spectra of both v3890 sgr and v745 sco obtained 12 years after the outburst .",
    "the strength of this line decreased with time , with the re - establishment of the envelope from the giant wind .",
    "we would like to point here that the optical depths and electron densities and also the oi line ratios in these systems as indicated by their quiescence spectra are quite similar to what is observed in `` feii '' novae during the early phases of their outburst when the heii 4686    line is absent ( anupama et al 1992 ; kamath et al 1997 ) .",
    "finally , the absorption by the cool giant wind enveloping the hot component can also account for the low quiescent x - ray luminosity of t crb and rs oph ( selvelli et al 1992 ; orio 1993 ) .",
    "the most striking behaviour in the symbiotic rne systems at quiescence is the variability of the hot radiation flux , manifested as variability in the uv and optical flux , and also in the fluxes in the emission lines .",
    "selvelli et al ( 1992 ) interpret the uv continuum and emission line variations in t crb as being due to changes in the photoionization source as a result of variable mass transfer from the red giant .",
    "shore & aufdenberg ( 1993 ) on the other hand interpret the variations as effects of the environmental absorption .",
    "the lack of eclipses and absence of substantial changes in the spectrum of rs oph rules out the brightening as being due to changes in the amount of intervening wind material .",
    "flickering detected in both t crb and rs oph can in principle provide some information about fluctuations in the mass transfer / accretion rate . in t crb ,",
    "the flickering is usually absent when the system is in a low state and present during the high state ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "this indicates an increase in the mass accretion rate during the optical brightening ( the high state ) .",
    "the existing data on rs oph do not show any such variations , but as we note above ( sec.3.2 ) , the observations are few and were all made when the star was relatively bright and blue .",
    "we therefore can not exclude fluctuations in the mass transfer and consequently in the mass accretion rate also in this system .",
    "the flickering activity in t crb was also investigated by zamanov & bruch ( 1998 ) .",
    "they identify the vicinity of a white dwarf as the site of the flickering , and find that the ratio of the flux of the flickering light source and the quiet part of the primary remains constant while the @xmath31 band flux varies considerably over long time scales .",
    "the latter result suggests that in t crb the mass is transferred at the same rate from the secondary through the accretion disk ( a steady state configuration ) , and it seems to rule out disk instabilities as the cause of the flickering .",
    "as demonstrated by shore & aufdenberg ( 1993 ) , the changes in the uv spectrum from an absorption spectrum to an emission line spectrum with no change in the total uv flux are due to changes in the line - of - sight column density through the wind envelope .",
    "in particular , they found that @xmath104 is necessary to produce shell features in the uv spectrum and for the emission lines to be suppressed . since in both t crb and rs oph the appearance of the shell features and the lack of strong emission lines",
    "is generally not correlated with the binary motion , to produce @xmath105 , @xmath106 is required for an average @xmath107  .",
    "it is interesting that this is roughly consistent with the accretion rate necessary to power the quiescent hot component luminosity in t crb and rs oph , and to produce nova eruptions with the observed frequency .",
    "shore & aufdenberg ( 1993 ) also found that the mean column density through the surrounding medium must be less than @xmath108 to observe strong emission lines .",
    "it is interesting that the only detection of the optical heii 4686 emission line in rs oph coincided with notable decline in the visual magnitude .",
    "this coincidence can be qualitatively explained as follows .",
    "the decrease in the giant mass loss rate , and in @xmath109 , results in disappearance of the absorbing species from the line of sight , so the emission is less affected ; while the temporary decline in the mass accretion rate results in decrease in the hot component luminosity .",
    "summarizing , we suggest that the changes in the uv spectrum during constant @xmath35 phases , such as seen in t crb , are due to absorption effects , while the high and low states with corresponding changes in the luminosity are due to fluctuations in the mass accretion rates possibly caused by a variable mass loss from the red giant .",
    "the increase in the accretion rate during the high states also gives rise to flickering .",
    "fluctuation in mass accretion rate can also cause variations in the absorption column density .",
    "the observed variability in these systems is thus more likely a combination of both effects , i.e.  fluctuations in the mass accretion rate as well as change in the absorption column density .",
    "finally , the quiescent symbiotic recurrent novae show striking similarities with ch cyg , a highly variable symbiotic system .",
    "the hot component luminosity in ch cyg varies by a factor of @xmath110 , between @xmath111 and @xmath112  ( mikoajewska 1994 ) .",
    "the brightening of the hot component is associated with the appearance of flickering ( e.g. mikoajewski et al .",
    "1990 ; mikoajewski & leedjaerv 1998 ) , which suggests the system is accretion - powered .",
    "the optical / uv spectrum of ch cyg during bright phases resembles the spectra of the symbiotic recurrent novae , in particular the shell - absorption emerges , accompanied by hi , hei and feii emission lines while the uv emission lines are weak or absent ( mikoajewska et al 1988 ) .",
    "the accreting component in this system is a white dwarf ( mrset et al 1997 ; ezuka et al 1998 ) .",
    "we present in this paper the behaviour of rne with giant secondaries at quiescence .",
    "variability is detected in the emission line fluxes in correlation with the continuum variations .",
    "the total uv flux is also found to be variable in both rs oph and t crb .",
    "all these variations , which are related to the radiation flux from the ionizing source , are caused by fluctuations in the mass accretion rates .",
    "it is concluded that the hot source in these systems is an accreting white dwarf embedded in an optically thick envelope of wind from the giant .",
    "this envelope absorbs the direct photons from the white dwarf .",
    "this picture can explain the observed uv spectra , the x - ray luminosity , and the lack of high excitation lines in these systems .",

    "<S> spectroscopic and photometric behaviour of the class of recurrent novae with giant secondaries ( t coronae borealis , rs ophiuchi , v3890 sagittarii and v745 scorpii ) at quiescence are presented in this study . </S>",
    "<S> the hot component in these systems is variable , with the variability manifesting as variability in the ultraviolet luminosity , the ultraviolet and optical emission line fluxes and in the @xmath0/visual magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the variations are uncorrelated with the binary orbital motion . </S>",
    "<S> the observed ultraviolet+optical spectral characteristics of the hot component in these systems can be explained by a white dwarf+accretion disc embedded in an envelope of wind from the m giant secondary . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest the observed variations are a result of ( a ) fluctuations in the mass accretion rate ; ( b ) changes in the column density of the absorbing wind envelope , which is optically thick .    </S>"
