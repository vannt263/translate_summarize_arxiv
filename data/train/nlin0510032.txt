    "in the most general setting one can define a gray code as a listing of _ words _ , formed with @xmath0 _ letters _ from an _ alphabet _ with @xmath1 _ symbols _ , ordered in such a way that any two successive entries differ in just one symbol .",
    "these codes are named after frank gray , an engineer at bell laboratories who employed it in a patent in 1953 @xcite , although the use of the code has been traced back at least to 1878 when the french engineer jean maurice emile baudot ( after whom the name baud for the signaling rate measure was chosen ) developed a telegraph code on these grounds which readily prevailed in france .",
    "we are interested in the case where numerical symbols are involved .",
    "we can still distinguish different types of codes according to the number system used .",
    "the most commonly employed basis are of course 2 and 10 giving rise to the _ binary _ and _ decimal _ gray codes respectively . originally , the characteristic feature of these codes was important in mechanical devices such as counters , for no more than one piece at a time needs to act in every counting operation .",
    "needless to say , this feature decreases the possibility of occurrence of errors albeit these may still be large .",
    "although nowadays perhaps old - fashioned , a very illustrative and familiar situation comes from the mechanical odometer of a car . when it reads 9999 km .",
    "five inner wheels have to rotate to show 10000 km .",
    "gray code is designed to avoid such _ multiple _ changes .    in a wide variety of types",
    "gray codes have been and still are applied in a large range of extremely distinct fields .",
    "we leave apart their use as puzzle - solvers @xcite ( e.g. the towers of hanoi or the chinese rings ) or in some even more bizarre application like campanology @xcite . as a sample of more canonical fields where gray codes are relevant we can cite as mere examples : database searching @xcite , design of charged particle detectors @xcite , space filling hilbert curves @xcite , genetic algorithms @xcite and their use in parameter optimization problems @xcite , neural networks @xcite , computation of unstable periodic orbits in chaotic attractors @xcite and , very recently , quantum computing @xcite .",
    "even a little surfing in the web will convince the reader of their importance in commercial matters related to a - d converters or design of communication codes .",
    "in our case it was using the native gray code to generate walsh functions that we were led to the considerations presented in this paper .",
    "we take a gray code as the play ground in which we build and represent some construction that is then analyzed by techniques familiar in other fields like dynamical systems or time series analysis but whose application is novel , so we think , in this context . the construction",
    "we refer to is a permutation , @xmath2 of natural numbers which in fact constitutes a known sequence , listed as a003188 in oeis @xcite .",
    "our approach is basically descriptive and is not directly related to the interesting topic of the mutual relationship between gray codes and permutations which has been extensively considered in the literature @xcite . in section [ reflec ]",
    "the specific type of gray code which we will focus our attention on is briefly reviewed , namely the so - called _ binary reflected gray code _",
    "( brgc for short )",
    ". then we build what we call gray curve which we analyze from a fractal geometry point of view in section [ selfsim ] .",
    "statistical considerations borrowed from modern time series analysis are applied in section [ timeseries ] .",
    "for easier reading we have postponed to section [ permu ] the discussion of the technical details of the structure of the permutation of @xmath3 elements associated to the native gray code . in the last section",
    "we add some final comments .",
    "the general definition of gray code recalled in the introduction corresponds to what is known in the literature as a @xmath4-gray code and can in fact be fulfilled by very different orderings .",
    "consequently one can find in the literature a considerable variety of members in the family of gray codes and generalizations @xcite .",
    "we are only interested in the length@xmath0 _ binary _ subclass which includes all @xmath3 words of @xmath0 bits ordered in such a way that any two consecutive words differ in just one bit .",
    "we will even restrict our attention to the binary reflected gray codes which are formally defined in a recursive way @xcite :    let @xmath5 denote the empty string and @xmath6 be the brgc sequence of @xmath0bit strings , then @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the sequence @xmath6 with @xmath9 prefixed to each string , and @xmath10 denotes the sequence @xmath6 in reverse order with @xmath11 prefixed to each string .",
    ".native gray code construction for the first @xmath12 natural numbers and its associated permutation @xmath13 . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     perhaps the easiest way to seize the idea that underlies the reflected binary gray code is through an example .",
    "table-[tgray16 ] shows the first @xmath14 decimal integers @xmath15 and their corresponding binary gray code with @xmath16 .",
    "the obvious first column lists the natural decimal ordering we are familiar with . the second column , which we shall not use explicitly in the following , is included just to explicitly appreciate the differences between standard base-2 and gray code orderings .",
    "the latter is shown in the fourth column . a first look at it reveals the aforementioned defining feature : adjacent entries differ in one , and only one , bit .",
    "the third column is incorporated to illustrate more clearly the building procedure from equation ( [ knuth ] ) .",
    "the fifth column , which is central to our discussion , displays the decimal version of the previous column .    we have identified four blocks of rows in the table-[tgray16 ] which will help in the explanation that follows , referred to the third column .",
    "the first block with two rows can be considered the seed for the gray code , it represents @xmath17 from equation ( [ knuth ] ) .",
    "the next block includes the previous one together with the added next two rows .",
    "when observing only the right - most bit in these latter one sees simply the previous two rows in reverse order , i.e. @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath9 and @xmath11 are added respectively to the left we complete @xmath19 .",
    "observe that in order not to obscure the illustration of the building process the @xmath9 has not actually been written in the first two rows .",
    "the third block adds @xmath20 new rows which accommodate the first @xmath20 rows in reverse order and then the left - most @xmath11 is prefixed .",
    "the fourth block illustrates the procedure again to obtain @xmath21 which is given in full in the fourth column .",
    "the generalization to @xmath3 elements is straightforward .",
    "this is a recursive algorithmic way to construct the gray code table .",
    "there are other possibilities for describing an algorithm leading to gray codes .",
    "for example , once we have chosen the number of bits , @xmath0 , we can start with an arbitrary string of length @xmath0 . the next term in the sequence",
    "is obtained by changing only one bit . from here on the same procedure is repeated with the proviso that strings which have already appeared in the listing are discarded . observe however that in this way we obtain certainly a binary gray code , although we can not assure it is the native brgc .",
    "apart from these recursive and constructive ways to obtain a brgc of given length there is also an explicit method @xcite .",
    "let us write the @xmath1th entry of the brgc of length @xmath0 as the string @xmath22 , then the @xmath23th bit ( from left to right ) is given by the parity of a binomial coefficient by the following expression which will be helpful in section-[permu ] : @xmath24 } \\qquad     ( { \\rm      mod}\\ ; 2)\\ ] ] where @xmath25 $ ] is the integer part function and @xmath26 , @xmath27",
    ". a comment may be in order here",
    ". the previous equation could give the wrong impression that the gray code representative of the natural number @xmath1 may sensibly change with the total number of bits @xmath0 . either from equation ( [ conder ] ) or directly from ( [ knuth ] ) one can easily see that this is not the case .",
    "increasing @xmath0 only adds @xmath9 s to the left of the representative string .",
    "the native code is cyclic in the sense that 16 , in our example , would go onto 0 . more generally , the code is cyclic provided we deal with a number of elements that is a power of @xmath28 .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the exact number of cyclic gray codes for general @xmath0 , which is related to the number of hamiltonian paths in an hypercube , is still an open problem in combinatoric analysis . from the numeric stand point ,",
    "the gray code listings that we use here were generated with the short fortran routine in @xcite .",
    "eventually , we are particularly interested in interpreting the entries in the gray code column as natural numbers written in base-2 .",
    "their decimal conversion is given in the last column of the table-[tgray16 ] .",
    "comparison of first and fifth columns admits the following interpretation which we word in two obviously equivalent ways :    1 .",
    "the last column in table-[tgray16 ] is a specific permutation of the @xmath14 elements @xmath29 . or in general",
    ", the length @xmath0 brgc gives a permutation of the @xmath3 elements @xmath30 which we denote by @xmath13 .",
    "2 .   the last column in table-[tgray16 ] defines a function of a discrete variable in a definition domain with @xmath14 ( in general @xmath3 ) points .",
    "the reason we have stated separately these , otherwise interchangeable , sentences is because each of them suggests a different line of approach . in fact , while the permutation terminology is more amenable to combinatorial analysis , the functional sense calls to mind the idea of discrete dynamical system associated to the iteration of functions and related fractal structures .",
    "both interpretations will be considered in this paper and yield interesting findings when considering @xmath3 elements with @xmath31 . by now , we stress the fact that all of our development pivots about the correspondence between the first ( decimal sequence in standard order ) and the fourth columns ( decimal equivalent of the binary gray code entry ) in table-[tgray16 ] .",
    "gray codification has been then just an intermediary in the process .",
    "we introduce now some notation .",
    "let @xmath32}\\equiv \\{d_n = n , n= 0,1,2,3,\\ldots,2^n-1\\}$ ] denote the sequence of the first @xmath3 natural numbers in base-@xmath33 and @xmath34}\\equiv \\",
    "{ g_n , n=0,1,\\ldots,2^n-1\\}$ ] , the decimal representation of the gray code , i.e. , for @xmath16 , the last column in table-[tgray16 ] .",
    "@xmath13 denotes the permutation that connects @xmath32}$ ] and @xmath34}$ ] for a given @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath13 is the element of the symmetric group @xmath35 which acts on @xmath32}$ ] according to @xmath36 in the next two sections we present a series of heuristic considerations on @xmath13 deferring to section [ permu ] its more technical details .",
    "let us now represent graphically the action of @xmath13 .",
    "we consider then the set @xmath37 of the @xmath38 plane consisting of the points with coordinates @xmath39 , @xmath40 in figure-[gray - fig1 ] , we plot @xmath34}$ ] _ versus _",
    "@xmath32}$ ] up to @xmath41 , where we have connected successive points only as a visual help .",
    "a direct view of the disconnected set is given in the lower inset of the same figure .",
    "when no confusion may arise we shall continue to refer to this set as the gray code curve .",
    "we could describe it , at first , as a kind of crinkly devil s staircase . in view of the algorithmic way explained above to build up @xmath34}$ ]",
    ", it becomes clear the self - similar nature of the plot : increasing a new bit to the leftmost position of the gray number means to sum a certain power of two , and besides , the preceding binary structure is inherited with a reversed ordering . in the @xmath42 representation of the upper inset the scale invariance is fully appreciated . in the present section",
    "we describe the set @xmath37 for large @xmath0 from the point of view of fractal geometry .",
    "the self - similarity of the gray code curve may be made explicit .",
    "figure-[gray - ifs ] contains its first @xmath43 points .",
    "two subsets of @xmath14 points each have been framed .",
    "the subset of points in frame b is geometrically obtained from subset a by a procedure of the type _ replicate , reflect and translate _ , as follows :    1 .",
    "make an adjacent copy of the set of points in panel a. 2 .",
    "reverse the abscissae order in the replicated copy , i.e. substitute it by its image in a vertical mirror .",
    "3 .   add @xmath44 (= cardinal of the subset ) units to every ordinate .",
    "this is panel b.    it is easy to see that inside plot frame a a similar procedure has been followed starting with the eight first points .",
    "the seed of the procedure was just @xmath45 .    to put this description in formulae",
    "let @xmath46 be @xmath47 the set of the first @xmath48 points of our curve , @xmath49 then @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the image set of @xmath46 under the function @xmath52 defined on @xmath38 which corresponds to the previously described manipulations . by this iterative procedure",
    "the whole curve in figure-[gray - fig1 ] grows out . from a purely geometric point of view",
    "the previous function defines an affine transformation .",
    "but its translation part depends on @xmath1 , the generation index , a feature to which we shall come back .",
    "alternatively we can inscribe the curve in the unit square with vertices @xmath53 by the following iterative procedure .",
    "let us denote by @xmath54 the set @xmath55 , incidentally @xmath56 , and define @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are respectively the image sets of @xmath60 under the affine ( still @xmath1-dependent in the case of @xmath61 ) transformations @xmath62 which scale down , reflect and translate the curve . from all these considerations the fractal flavor of the whole construction is evident .",
    "the procedures just described to construct the gray set are clearly reminiscent of the so called iterated functions systems , very popular in fractal building and image compression @xcite . as it is well known a collection of functions are applied , either following a deterministic plan or randomly , to a simple object .",
    "the two more striking features of this approach are , on one hand , how astonishingly complex images arise from very simple seeds . on the other hand perfect coincidence in the final product of deterministic and random processes , although more and more familiar every time thanks in part to the popularization of chaos studies , is always odd .",
    "although not necessarily so , in most of the applications of ifs the functions involved are a few affine transformations with constant parameters .",
    "it is natural then to look for an ifs generator of our set @xmath37 .",
    "the problem is , however , that one can not find constant parameters for a bidimensional affine transformation capable of generating by iteration our fractal .",
    "the reason being the @xmath1 dependence mentioned earlier .",
    "so we are led to look for more general functions , i.e. non - linear ones , of the coordinates , such that when iterated produce the desired result .",
    "but the @xmath1 dependence continues to be a nuisance .",
    "the only way out is to increase the dimension of the space we are working on from two to three .",
    "this is exactly the same idea one takes advantage of in , e.g. , classical mechanics to convert a time dependent hamiltonian system in an autonomous equivalent .",
    "we then propose to extend @xmath38 to @xmath63 and take as our ifs the following @xmath64 functions : @xmath65    the price one has to pay for getting rid of the @xmath1 dependence is the higher dimension we work on and the non - linear character of the function @xmath66 involved .",
    "needless to say that for representation purposes we only plot the projection on the @xmath67 plane .",
    "anyway , equation ( [ k_ifs ] ) changes now to @xmath68 observe that the action of @xmath69 and @xmath66 on the @xmath70 coordinate prevents the existence of fixed points when each of these functions is iterated on its own . in the @xmath67 plane when @xmath69 is repeatedly iterated the results",
    "tend rapidly to the origin .",
    "it is only a little bit more complicated to see that iteration of @xmath66 leads in the limit to the point @xmath71 .",
    "the combined and competing iteration of the two functions is what produces the final figure .",
    "the set \\{f , g } constitutes a _ bona fide _ ifs .",
    "the system is deterministic if @xmath69 and @xmath66 are repeatedly applied one after the other . when this is done starting with @xmath72 , then the whole set @xmath37 is generated .",
    "it is a random ifs if @xmath69 and @xmath66 are iterated with prescribed probability @xmath73 on an arbitrary initial point in the unit square .",
    "@xmath37 is obtained as the final attractor of the process .",
    "our proposal now is to interpret @xmath74 as successive values in a time series .",
    "conventional statistics ( average values , standard deviations and other indicators calculated from higher moments ) are of no particular interest for us here because they depend solely of the numerical values @xmath74 and these are simply the first @xmath3 natural numbers .",
    "the order in which the different values appear does not play any role in the computation of those statistics .",
    "the information from the time series obtained in this way could be termed as static .",
    "instead , we are interested in the dynamics represented by the series . the ordering , then , matters and we need other indicators . with this aim we analyze in the present section the series of increments @xmath75 with @xmath76 , @xmath77      the inset in figure-[gray - powerlaw ] shows a sample of the series of increments @xmath75 . by its very definition",
    "the average of the first @xmath79 values is @xmath80 and because it is always positive the gray curve is globally increasing .",
    "the statistics on the set of values @xmath81 reveals that their frequency obeys a power law , with the exception of the very small values ( see main graph in figure-[gray - powerlaw ] ) . as a matter of fact , the frequency histogram goes like @xmath82 , which means that the probability of encountering a jump @xmath83 grows as @xmath84 .",
    "one could express this fact by saying that the values @xmath74 are far from equidistant .",
    "by contrast , it seems appropriate to mention here that in its binary form , brgc is characterized by any two consecutive elements being equally spaced by a unit hamming distance .",
    "an often encountered statistic when analyzing time series is the so - called residence time , or sojourn time , @xmath85 . to deal with it",
    ", one has to define a dichotomic property of the system such as crossing a predefined threshold and keep track of the time elapsed between successive crossings . in our case",
    "we focus our attention on changes in sign of @xmath78 .",
    "accordingly we define the residence times as the length of the sequences in which @xmath78 keeps its sign .",
    "if it stays just one unit in the , say , positive region , we define its sojourn time to be just one unit .",
    "when we collect the statistic for residence times in the set of values of @xmath78 the fact which first calls our attention is that @xmath85 can only take three different values : @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "suppose @xmath78 has changed sign with respect to @xmath88 , then there are only three possibilities : either @xmath89 has sign opposite to that of @xmath78 ( then @xmath90 ) , or @xmath89 and @xmath78 have equal sign but different from that of @xmath91 ( which corresponds to @xmath92 ) , or @xmath78 , @xmath89 and @xmath91 have the same sign which necessarily changes in @xmath93 ( giving @xmath94 ) .",
    "never more than two consecutive steps can be given without encountering a change of sign .",
    "as a matter of fact the statistics reveals more than that : the probabilities ( relative frequencies of appearance ) for the values of @xmath85 are exactly @xmath95 this behavior of the residence times contrasts with other known situations . for example , exponentially decreasing probability distributions are common in chaotic systems .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the statistics of residence times we are treating provides information only about changes of sign in @xmath78 .",
    "it says nothing about the direction ( upwards or downwards ) of the change .",
    "the fact that , as mentioned earlier , the average of increments @xmath75 is positive suggests the increasing overall character of our curve . by simply looking at it at any scale one",
    "corroborates that it is globally increasing , in spite of its ups and downs we perceive in more detailed graphs . in the jargon of time series analysis one",
    "says that this reflects extremely persistent dynamics which we analyze next from the hurst exponent point of view .",
    "the so - called re - scaled range statistical analysis , @xmath96 analysis , is a method designed to reveal long - run correlations or anti - correlations in a complex process .",
    "the idea was first introduced in the analysis of some hydrologic time series , but has been also applied in other studies in climatology , geophysics , econometrics ,     following feder @xcite , we define the average increment over a period of @xmath1 units as @xmath97 the local accumulated departure of @xmath78 from the mean @xmath98 is then @xmath99=g_n-\\frac{n}{k}g_k\\ ] ] the range of @xmath100 over this period reads @xmath101 where the extremal functions are evaluated in the interval @xmath102 .",
    "the range increases with @xmath1 .",
    "when properly normalized to the standard deviation @xmath103 ^ 2\\right)^{1/2}\\ ] ] then hurst found that the re - scaled range @xmath96 is well described by the power law @xmath104 where @xmath105 is called _",
    "hurst exponent_. purely random series give @xmath106 .",
    "curves with @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) witness a long run correlation of persistent ( anti - persistent ) character .",
    "this feature means that positive changes are more likely followed by positive ( negative ) ones , whereas for random phenomena both results for the next move are always equiprobable .",
    "hurst @xcite found that most natural phenomena give rise to @xmath109 , which is sometimes referred to as hurst phenomenon .    in the case of the gray curve a hurst  like",
    "analysis provides a value @xmath110 , revealing the extreme persistence of the series of increments , as pointed out above .",
    "this analysis appears in figure-[gray - fdh ] where @xmath96 ( straight line with open circles ) is to be read on the right scale .",
    "we follow a technique by higuchi @xcite to measure the fractal dimension of a set of points @xmath111 , @xmath112 , forming the graph of a function like that in figure-[gray - fig1 ] .",
    "the idea consists in measuring the average length @xmath113 of samples with @xmath1 points each .",
    "then , if @xmath114 , the curve is fractal with dimension @xmath115 . for instance ,",
    "a time series obtained with pure noise should give @xmath116 , whereas for a regular curve @xmath117 .",
    "the method recalls the so - called richardson plot in fractal geometry .    in figure-[gray - fdh",
    "] we have plotted in doubly logarithmic scale @xmath113 against @xmath1 , with @xmath41 ( straight line with solid dots ) .",
    "the straight line is fitted to the points by the least square method and gives a slope @xmath118 .",
    "here the error estimate comes from the stability of the result with respect to the number of data rather than from the fitting procedure .",
    "these values for @xmath105 and @xmath115 are consistent with the connection formula relating @xmath105 and @xmath115 which reads : @xmath119 .",
    "a common tool in nonlinear analysis of time series consists in giving a 2d- representation of the 1d time series called return plot .",
    "a return plot , or first  return map , of the sequence @xmath120 is a 2d  plot of the points @xmath121 .",
    "thus , for instance , a true random sequence gives rise to a uniformly scattered plot .",
    "chaotic sequences where the generation of the @xmath122th term involves only the @xmath123th term produce 1d  patterns . in the present case , the return plot for the gray curve is in figure-[gray - fig3 ] .",
    "we have drawn not only the points but also a path connecting them in order to realize the variety of jumps involved , in accordance with the set of values @xmath124 .",
    "the inset in figure-[gray - fig3 ] is a zoom of the indicated zone showing the detail of the curly structure of the curve .",
    "it is clear how strongly the natural numbers sequence gets intermingled in the permutation @xmath13 : the recurrence plot for the set @xmath125 is simply a straight line like @xmath126 .      at the end of subsection [ ifs ]",
    "it was pointed out that the gray fractal can be obtained as the attractor of a random process of iteration of functions @xmath69 and @xmath66 . here",
    "we investigate the statistics obeyed by the distances traveled in every move .",
    "this point of view quits the static perspective on the fractal and enters a new kind of dynamics .",
    "starting from an arbitrary point in the unit square , runs of @xmath127 points were carried out .",
    "we have retained just the last @xmath128 points , and the previous ones were considered as a transient .",
    "the idea is to lose any memory about the initial position by getting close enough to the true attractor .",
    "a histogram of the euclidean distances traveled between two consecutive points in a random walk on the gray fractal is shown in figure-[fig - fly ] .",
    "it is noteworthy the presence of equally spaced peaks on the log - scale .",
    "the same is true for the bottom of valleys .",
    "this phenomenon means that the geometry of the fractal selects ( or avoids ) some particular flying distances along its random generation .",
    "the specific mechanism underlying this selection rule is unclear , as according to the statistic of @xmath78 in subsection-[stat - d ] all length distances are present in the fractal itself .",
    "in this section we collect some properties of the permutation @xmath13 which have been instrumental in most of the considerations presented so far . in correspondence with the name _ native gray code _ sometimes used for the brgc we call @xmath13 the _ native gray permutation_. a little experimentation and some reflection lead to the following observations :    1 .   the recurrent definition of the permutation @xmath129 as a function with domain @xmath32}$ ] is @xmath130 with @xmath131 , and where @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",

    "all other elements of @xmath32}$ ] under the action of @xmath129 are grouped in cycles , but only cycles of length @xmath146 will appear . in symbols that means that we can factor out @xmath129 in cycles in the form@xmath147 where @xmath148 represents a cycle of @xmath146 elements of which @xmath149 different specimens appear in @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath150 indicates that the length of the longest cycle or cycles is @xmath151 .",
    "4 .   the distribution of the @xmath152 elements of @xmath32}$ ] in cycles follows a strict procedure : they fill cycles @xmath148 in increasing order of @xmath153 .",
    "no @xmath154cycle appears until all allowable @xmath155cycles are filled up .",
    "moreover , @xmath149 has a maximum value independent of @xmath156 in other words , once a certain number of @xmath154cycles has been reached no matter how big @xmath0 becomes no other @xmath154cycle will be formed .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath0 increases the factorization of @xmath129 keeps the structure corresponding to the lower values of @xmath0 .",
    "the new cycles formed are as long as the longest ones for previous values of @xmath0 or longer .",
    "this property confers to @xmath13 a certain type of shell structure .",
    "@xmath154cycles will appear for the first time for @xmath157 in the language of the theory of dynamical systems one could say that at these values of @xmath0 a period doubling bifurcation appears .",

    "is the discovery of strong selection rules acting on the system which manifest themselves in the distribution of residence times with only three allowed values , and of flying distances .",
