    "the quark mass gap damps when the quark momentum is far away from the domain of condensation . in vacuum ,",
    "the damping scale of the mass function @xmath39 may play a similar role to the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff , @xmath40 , in the usual njl model ( see the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] ) . in this sense , the form factor can naturally remove the uv cutoff artifact of the njl - type model .    [",
    "0.6 ]   [ 0.6 ]     all of these aspects are crucial when we consider dense quark matter .",
    "since condensation phenomena should happen near the fermi surface , the effective uv cutoff should appear in the distance from the fermi surface , not that from vacuum ( see the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] ) .",
    "if we fixed the effective uv cutoff to be the same as the vacuum value by hand , arguments on chiral symmetry breaking would not make sense for @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , because of pauli blocking , phase space for quarks contributing to the condensate would disappear , leading to chiral symmetry restoration as a cutoff artifact",

    "we claim that the introduction of the form factor gives a natural extension of the treatment of the zero - density njl model to that at finite density .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to give detailed and analytic insights on the interweaving of chiral spirals and on the associated breakdown of the rotational invariance .",

    "the surface thickness @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) characterizes the momentum scale for which non - perturbative fermi surface effects are important .    [ 1.0 ]     the use of the wedge shape is motivated by the following reasons : in order to maximize the energy gain from condensation effects , each patch should contain only one chiral spiral by aligning total momenta of a bunch of particle - hole pairs . if we had a misalignment , interplay among chiral spirals would reduce the size of the gap , as exemplified in sec .",
    "[ 1 + 1dexample ] .",
    "so we have to look for the most effective shape to achieve the alignment of total momenta .",
    "an obvious candidate is the flat fermi surface with which particles and holes participating in the condensate can stay close to the fermi surface , saving the virtual excitation energies .",

    "[ 1.0 ] , a depth @xmath4 , and a surface thickness @xmath47 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    what is the principle to determine the number of patches ?",
    "it is essentially determined by the balance between the kinetic - energy cost and the condensation - energy gain . without condensation effects",
    ", the fermi surface would simply take a circle shape that minimizes the kinetic energy .",
    "once condensation effects are turned on , the associated energy gain can overtake the kinetic - energy cost , changing the shape of the fermi sea from a circle to a polygon with discrete number of wedges .",
    "the condensation effects appear in two places .",
    "one is the energy reduction of single - particle contributions inside of one wedge , as is the case in the single chiral spiral problem .",
    "the other is the inter - patch interactions among different chiral spirals .",
    "the latter will provide an energy cost , that is , chiral spirals destroy one another if their wavevectors are different ( as explained in sec .  [",
    "sec : interference ] , and also some results from the existing literatures will be addressed in sec .  [ comparison ] ) .",
    "this means that we should divide the fermi sea into not too many wedges to get the largest energy gain .",
    "therefore the size of one wedge tends to be as large as possible until the kinetic - energy cost becomes too big .",
    "let us outline how to optimize the shape of the fermi sea . in the following , we will consider the canonical ensemble , in which the particle number is fixed",
    ". then the fermi volume must be conserved , so it follows that @xmath48 here the lhs is a fermion number for the plain circle shape of the fermi sea , while the rhs is for the deformed fermi sea . for small @xmath3 we can approximate the rhs by the taylor expansion in terms of @xmath3 , with which we can solve @xmath49 as @xmath50 thus , the size of one patch in the transverse direction is @xmath51 now that @xmath4 is solved as a function of @xmath3 , the multiple chiral spiral states are characterized by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and the single - particle mass gap , @xmath52 .",
    "we will perform the energy minimization by taking @xmath3 and @xmath52 as variational parameters .",
    "provided that the energy minimum exists for @xmath53 , we can expand the energy density by powers of @xmath3 . it will turn out that the expression takes the following form , @xmath54 the @xmath55 term can appear simply because @xmath56 , but it will disappear for vanishing @xmath52 , that is , @xmath57 . expanding @xmath58 by powers of @xmath59 , we expect @xmath60 where we did not write possible non - analytic terms explicitly .",

    "let us first discuss terms insensitive to details of condensation effects , computing at @xmath61 .",
    "the first non - vanishing contribution of @xmath62 with non - trivial @xmath3 dependence should arise from the kinetic - energy cost for the deformation of the fermi surface .",
    "the energy at @xmath61 is an increasing function of @xmath3 , @xmath63 where the first term gives the trivial contribution which should be subtracted out is for degeneracy factors of colors and spins for four component spinors .",

    "it is extremely important to notice that the non - trivial deformation energy does not appear until @xmath66 .",
    "the volume conservation of the fermi sea cancels the @xmath67-term out from the average kinetic energy .",
    "terms beyond @xmath66 are much smaller than @xmath68 and irrelevant in our minimization procedure .",
    "thus , the energy minimum will be found by balancing the @xmath69 term with condensation effects which yield terms with smaller powers of @xmath3 than the @xmath69 term . in the following we concentrate on the estimation of such condensation terms .",
    "the condensation effects depend on interaction properties of models .",
    "the point of our model is that at large @xmath6 the single - particle dispersion of a fermion with momentum @xmath38 is determined only by condensates within the domain of the size @xmath70 around @xmath38 .",
    "it means that if we consider the gap for single particles farther from patch boundaries than @xmath34 , it will be affected only by the single chiral spiral , not by adjacent chiral spirals .",
    "the above argument suggests that we have to evaluate the mass gap differently depending on the different domains of @xmath3 .",
    "then there are intersection points of more than one patch that have interactions among them .",
    "to solve the gap equation , hence , we have to take into account the influence of several chiral spirals simultaneously .",
    "this is a rather technically complicated problem .",
    "fortunately , the energy minimum in our problem will be outside of this @xmath3 domain",
    ".    we can self - consistently show that the transverse size of one patch is much larger than @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath71 once this condition is satisfied , the single - particle gap in one patch can be determined independently from @xmath3 , except in the region close to the patch boundaries .",
    "we denote such a solution as @xmath72 .",
    "then the energy gain from condensation effects should be @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the one - patch phase space where the condensation occurs .",
    "one important observation here is that , while the gap is insensitive to @xmath3 , the phase space has @xmath3 dependence , so that the leading term is @xmath3 independent after multiplying a patch number @xmath43 .",
    "let us see contributions at the intersection point of two adjacent patches .",
    "the point is that a particle from one patch and condensates from other patches interact within a limited domain of @xmath70 near the intersection points .",
    "its phase space is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore the contribution from the intersection points is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is some function of the order @xmath77 with @xmath78 be the mass gap near the boundary , and vanishes as @xmath79 .",
    "the contribution must be an energy cost .",
    "the reason is that in eq .",
    "( [ con1 ] ) we overestimated the energy gain which should be reduced around the patch boundaries .",
    "the misalignment of chiral spiral wavevectors tends to destroy the different chiral spirals one another , and reduces the size of the gap at the intersection points .",
    "diagrammatically , this contribution will appear as interactions among chiral spiral mean fields in different domains .",
    "the presence of this term becomes more important for smaller @xmath3 .",
