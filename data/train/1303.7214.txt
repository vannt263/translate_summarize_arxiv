    "thermalization of the quark - gluon plasma is one of the most challenging problems in current heavy ion physics . starting with two colliding nuclei in a form of color glass condensate with high gluon occupation @xmath0 below saturation scale @xmath1 @xcite and following the initial impact , a subsequent strong field evolution stage ( likely with instabilities @xcite ) till about the time @xmath2",
    "is then succeeded by a far - from - equilibrium gluon - dominant matter , the glasma @xcite .",
    "the evolution of this glasma stage toward a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) that is close to local equilibratium and exhibits viscous - hydrodynamic behavior , is indicated by phenomenology to be reached on the order of a fermi over c time ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "precisely how this occurs remains to be fully understood .",
    "describing the pre - equilibrium evolution with kinetic equations is a very useful approach , based on which the so - called `` bottom - up '' thermalization scenario was developed @xcite .",
    "there is however the complication of instability driven by anisotropy that may change this picture ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are also other kinetic - based approaches , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "more recently an alternative thermalization scenario , based on crucial role of high initial overpopulation in the glasma and kinetic evolution dominated by elastic collisions , has been proposed in @xcite . in this scenario , while the initial scale @xmath3 is large compared with @xmath4 and thus the coupling @xmath5 is small , the high occupation @xmath6 elevates the elastic scattering rate to be of the order @xmath7 rather than the usual @xmath8 , and the glasma is essentially an emergent strongly interacting matter with weak coupling albeit large aggregate of constituents .",
    "two important scales are introduced to characterize the distribution , the hard cut - off scale @xmath9 beyond which @xmath10 and the soft high - occupation scale @xmath11 below which @xmath6 . while the initial glasma has the two scales overlapping @xmath12 , during the course of thermalization the two scales",
    "are separated eventually toward @xmath13 upon thermalization .",
    "one particularly nontrivial observation in the elastic - dominant picture is that the high initial overpopulation @xmath14 and the conservation of both energy and particle number will necessarily require the formation of a bose - einstein condensate that absorbs the excess gluons .",
    "this has been explicitly shown to occur by numerically solving the elastic kinetic equation derived under small angle approximation @xcite .",
    "there have been intensive discussions related to this picture from a variety of approaches , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "strong evidences for the formation of such a bose - einstein condensate have been reported for similar thermalization problem in the classical - statistical lattice simulation of scalar field theory @xcite .",
    "the case for non - abelian gauge theory is more complicated and still under investigation @xcite .",
    "one important question that has not been addressed in the above scenario is the role of inelastic processes .",
    "this issue could indeed be critical for at least two reasons ( see discussions in e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "first of all the inelastic processes will spoil the particle number conservation , and one might naively argue that the excessive gluons in the overpopulated glasma could simply be eliminated by very fast inelastic collisions . secondly , to make it even worse , the inelastic processes are parametrically at the same order as the elastic processes ( as opposed to naive power counting ) , so there appears no apparent dominance of the elastic over the inelastic and one may indeed worry that the inelastic could efficiently reduce total particle number . in such a situation ,",
    "an explicit evaluation including both elastic and inelastic collisions becomes mandatory to clarify what will happen after including both types of collisions . to be precise , once the inelastic processes",
    "are included , one does not expect any condensation in the ultimate thermal equilibrium because with long enough time the inelastic processes will always remove any excessive particles .",
    "the interesting question , instead , is what changes the inelastic collisions bring to the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "in particular , it is found  @xcite that with purely elastic scatterings the overpopulated system is driven toward a dynamical onset of condensation in a finite time via critical scaling behavior in the infrared regime .",
    "it is extremely interesting to know , upon including the inelastic processes , how such dynamical evolution may be modified and whether the transient off - equilibrium condensation would still occur or not .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to address this important question by studying the kinetic evolution of a highly overpopulated system starting from glasma - type initial condition with both @xmath15 and @xmath16 scatterings .",
    "in section 2 we will derive the inelastic collision kernel under the collinear and small angle approximations using the gunion - bertsch formula for the @xmath17 matrix element . in section 3",
    "we will use numerical solutions as well as analytic analysis to understand the role of the inelastic process for both the global particle number change and the local behavior at small momentum region .",
    "finally we will conclude in section 4 . as a first step toward understanding the inelastic contributions and for simplicity and unambiguity",
    ", we will focus on the static box case with isotropic distribution in this work and leave the study of expanding case for future work .",
    "in this section we will derive the kinetic evolution equation with both elastic and inelastic collisions .",
    "the kinetic equation deals with the gluon distribution function defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the spin and color degeneracy factor .",
    "the boltzmann equation for @xmath20 reads @xmath21+{\\cal c}_{2\\leftrightarrow 3}[f_p],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we denote @xmath20 by @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for later convenience",
    ", we also introduce the following notations : @xmath26 in what follows we will separately discuss the elastic term @xmath27 and the inelastic term @xmath28 .",
    "the collision kernel from the @xmath29 process with full nonlinearity has been studied in @xcite .",
    "here we only briefly summarize the main results .",

    "the dominant contribution of @xmath15 scattering in ( [ m22 ] ) comes from very small exchange momentum in @xmath39 or @xmath40 kinematic regimes , for which the incoming momenta only gets `` deflected '' by very small angle .",
    "if one uses this small angle approximation , then a rather neat kernel can be derived @xcite : @xmath41}\\rc , \\label{c22_sa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 coming from the leading - log contribution .",
    "the hard scale @xmath43 and soft scale @xmath44 in the above are defined via global integrals : @xmath45 for later convenience we also introduce the debye scale defined as @xcite @xmath46 it is interesting to notice that in a weakly coupled thermal qgp one has the well - defined separation of scales , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 . the matter becomes strongly interacting when the scales `` collapse '' together .",
    "one way for that to happen is to have the system become really strongly coupled @xmath50 which likely will be accompanied by change of underlying degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the other possibility , as in the case of glasma , is when the system is highly off - equilibrium and overpopulated @xmath51  in this case all the scales also become of the same order @xmath52 and make the system emerge as a strongly interacting matter .",
    "clearly , both the full form @xmath27 in ( [ c22_full ] ) and the small angle approximation form in ( [ c22_sa ] ) conserve the energy as well as particle number , as they should .",
    "in addition the bose - einstein distribution @xmath53 $ ] with any @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( in correspondence to the two conserved quantities ) is the fixed point solution that makes both ( [ c22_full ] ) and ( [ c22_sa ] ) vanish .",

    "we can thus further simplify the collision kernel using similar small angle approximation as in the elastic case .",

    "we will use the debye scale @xmath92 as the infrared cut , e.g. @xmath93 .",
    "we will also treat all leading logs as order one constant .",
    "again more detailed discussions are included in the appendix [ colli ] .",
    "lastly , one can show that the inelastic kernel conserves energy while not particle number , and the fixed point solution ( i.e. the equilibrium distribution ) is the bose - einstein distribution _ without _ chemical potential , @xmath94 .",
    "finally we combine the @xmath95 and @xmath96 kernels , and the final kinetic equation under small angle approximation and collinear approximation reads @xmath97+{\\cal c}^{\\rm eff}_{1 \\leftrightarrow 2}[f_p],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 the expression for @xmath99 is @xmath100}\\rc,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath101 parameterizing the contribution from @xmath102 to effective @xmath15 kernel .",

    "+ we therefore see that the effect of the inelastic collision is parametrically as important as the elastic one both near and far from equilibrium , and including the inelastic collision qualitatively changes the ultimate equilibrium solution .",
    "it is clear that even starting from highly overpopulated initial condition , eventually there will be no chemical potential nor any condensate in the final thermal distribution with the presence of inelastic collision .",
    "however , the very important question that has not been understood , is how the inelastic collision will affect the transient dynamical off - equilibrium condensation driven by the pure elastic evolution starting from initial high overpopulation .",
    "will the system still reach the onset of such condensation ?",
    "will the inelastic collision speed up , delay , or completely eliminate such an onset ?",
    "we will address these questions by numerically solving the above kinetic equations .",
    "in this section , we numerically solve the kinetic equation ( [ kernel_all ] ) , starting with a glasma - type initial condition as follows : @xmath120 with @xmath3 the saturation scale .",
    "we use @xmath3 as unit for all momenta / enegy etc and use @xmath121 as unit for time .",
    "as studied in @xcite , with a given initial occupation @xmath122 , the overpopulation parameter is @xmath123 and when @xmath124 , the system is overpopulated as compared with the stefan - boltzmann limit and the system will reach onset of condensation when there is only elastic collision .",
    "for simplicity we fix the initial occupation @xmath125 which is in the overpopulated regime .",
    "note that the constant @xmath126 can be absorbed by a redefinition of time variable , @xmath127 which we will use from now on .",
    "we therefore are left with three parameters , @xmath108 , @xmath107 , and @xmath89 .",
    "the inelastic contribution will increase with increasing @xmath108 and @xmath89 while the elastic will increase with increasing @xmath107 .",
    "we will study the effect of inelastic collision by comparison with the purely elastic case ( @xmath128 versus @xmath129 ) and by varying the strength of the inelastic kernel .",
    "let us first study the kinetic equation with only the inelastic kernel ( [ kernel_12 ] ) .",
    "although this is not a realistic modeling of the glasma system , it is a very interesting problem on its own and it also serves as a very useful check of whether the derived inelastic kernel produces the physically expected dynamics .",
    "furthermore it is a useful benchmark for a contrast with the evolution driven by both elastic and inelastic processes .",
    "we will choose @xmath130 without loss of generality because @xmath108 can be absorbed by redefining the time variable , @xmath131 .",
    "the kinetic equation is then solved numerically with only the inelastic kernel and with overpopulated initial condition @xmath125 .    in fig .",
    "[ fp_inf ] ( left panel ) , we show the distribution function @xmath132 at various time moments .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath132 , starting from the initial glasma - type shape , smoothly evolves into a bose - einstein distribution after about @xmath133 , with a temperature being the supposed value required by energy conservation and a vanishing chemical potential . very different from the evolution driven by elastic kernel with the same initial condition ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in the present purely inelastic case , the system is simply thermalized and during the thermalization there appears no onset of singularity ( bose - einstein condensate ) in the distribution .",
    "this can be explicitly checked by looking at the occupation at the smallest grid point @xmath134 as a function of time ( fig .",
    "[ fp_inf ] right panel ) : its value has a transient behavior of rapid rise and fall and then settles to the supposed thermal value .",
    "clearly , even with overpopulated initial condition , the inelastic process alone does not generate a dynamical onset of bose - einstein condensate , as one may reasonably expect .",
    "we have also studied the evolution of global quantities , with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ den_inf ] for the number density ( left panel ) as well as the entropy density ( right panel ) . the initial high overpopulation in gluon number is efficiently reduced by the inelastic processes , and the number density drops toward the supposed thermal value determined by equilibrium temperature .",
    "the entropy density on the other hand grows rapidly and approaches the thermal value as well .",
    "again all these features provide clear indication that with the purely inelastic kernel the system is simply thermalized as it should be .    from this study , we conclude that the @xmath135 inelastic processes as described by our derived kernel ( [ kernel_12 ] ) thermalize the system efficiently and eliminate excessive gluons from initial conditions effectively , and by these processes _ alone _ no dynamic onset of bec is to occur . with such benchmark case understood , it is thus tempting to see what will happen when the elastic @xmath136 processes are also included in addition to the inelastic .",

    "this picture is numerically verified in great details in @xcite .",
    "our discussion of the onset of condensation will stay in this picture ( as the elastic term is still present and its flux drives the small @xmath38 behavior ) and we will study how the inelastic process modifies it .    starting with the overpopulated initial condition ( [ initial ] )",

    "[ fz1_fp ] right we show the corresponding flux @xmath143 from the elastic kernel . again the flux behaves very similarly to the purely elastic case : one see a linear behavior at small p , @xmath144 and eventually upon onset of condensation the flux diverges ( see the blue curve near @xmath145 ) .    to get an intuitive idea of the contribution of the inelastic kernel , we plot the @xmath146 and @xmath147 in fig .",

    "we also notice that upon onset ( the blue dashed curve in the right panel ) the inelastic kernel near @xmath145 shows a divergent behavior in consistency with the elastic flux behavior .",

    "in summary , we have studied the kinetic evolution of a highly overpopulated system starting from glasma - type initial condition with the presence of both elastic and inelastic collisions . using the gunion - bertsch formula for the @xmath16 matrix element ,",
    "we have derived the inelastic collision kernel under the collinear and small angle approximations .",
    "putting together the inelastic kernel together with the previously obtained elastic kernel , we have then numerically solved the kinetic evolution for varied choices of parameters .",
    "our main finding is that the inelastic process has two effects : globally changing ( mostly reducing ) the total particle number , while locally at small @xmath38 always filling up the infrared regime extremely quickly .",
    "the latter effect is shown both from numerics and by analytic analysis .",
    "this effect significantly speeds up the emergence of local thermal form near @xmath145 and the vanishing of local `` chemical potential '' @xmath141 as previously found in the purely elastic collision case to lead to the onset of dynamical bose condensation .",
    "therefore in our present approach of including the inelastic scattering , we conclude that , contrary to some previously discussed expectations about the role of number non - conserving processes , the inelastic collision actually helps to build up the local `` critical form '' @xmath182 much faster and catalyzes the onset of condensation in the overpopulated glasma .",
    "our finding may sound counter - intuitive at first , as the usual conception would suggest that increasing the strength of the inelastic collisions tends to obstruct more effectively the formation of any condensate .",
    "it should however be emphasized that the evolution toward onset of bec that has been studied thus far is not the end of the story .",
    "our analysis addresses the evolution up to the onset of bec while does not treat the evolution afterwards . as is well known in the bec literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in order to describe the kinetic evolution of the system with the presence of condensate , a new set of kinetic equations is needed for an explicit description of the coupled evolution for a condensate plus a regular distribution .",
    "efforts are underway to derive these equations , and so far a kinetic study of the stage after bec onset for the glasma system has not been achieved to our best knowledge .",
    "however , it appears very plausible that the subsequent evolutions may develop as follows : immediately after onset , the strong ir flux will not cease right away but continue for a while and thus drive the condensate to grow in time ; at certain point , the time would be long enough to allow the inelastic processes to decrease the total number density adequately and cause the condensate to decay thus decreasing in time ; eventually the inelastic processes will be able to remove all excess gluons and lead to the thermal equilibrium state with neither condensate nor any chemical potential . while the detailed understanding of such dynamic processes can only be achieved through solving the new set of kinetic equations",
    ", one can reasonably expect that with increasing strength of the inelastic processes the whole evolution would be faster .",
    "thus the following overall picture may likely be the case : with increasing strength , the inelastic processes on one hand catalyze the onset of condensation initially , while on the other hand eliminate the fully formed condensate faster , thus limiting the time duration for the presence of condensate to be shorter . a schematic picture of such conjectured full evolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ conje ] , which is in line with the usual conception .",
    "it is worth mentioning that recent analysis in @xcite has shown that the the @xmath17 inelastic cross section from exact matrix element becomes significantly smaller than that from the gunion - bertsch formula , and amounts to @xmath183 of the @xmath136 cross section .",
    "it therefore seems very plausible that a realistic choice of @xmath108 value would be rather modest , which may imply a considerable time window for the condensate to be sizable and play an important role for the evolution . a complete investigation of the evolution including the condensate will be future project to be reported elsewhere .",

    "<S> in this paper we investigate the role of inelastic collisions in the kinetic evolution of a highly overpopulated gluon system starting from glasma - type initial condition . using the gunion - bertsch formula </S>",
    "<S> we derive the inelastic collision kernel under the collinear and small angle approximations . with both numerics and analytic analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the inelastic process has two effects : globally changing ( mostly reducing ) the total particle number , while locally at small momentum regime always filling up the infrared modes extremely quickly . </S>",
    "<S> this latter effect is found to significantly speed up the emergence of a local thermal distribution in the infrared regime with vanishing local `` chemical potential '' and thus catalyze the onset of dynamical bose - einstein condensation to occur faster ( as compared with the purely elastic case ) in the overpopulated glasma .    </S>",
