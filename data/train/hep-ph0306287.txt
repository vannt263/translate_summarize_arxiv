    "the four lectures on `` qcd phenomenology '' at the @xmath0@xmath1 school , delivered in the dungeon hall of the magnificent pylos castle were , naturally , labelled by greek letters and dealt with    * the basics of qcd and its main problems , * the running coupling and anatomy of the asymptotic freedom , * qcd partons and the rle of colour in multiple hadroproduction and * non - perturbative corrections to qcd observables .    in the written version of the lectures",
    "i have chosen to concentrate on the _ qualitative _ discussion of selected qcd phenomena rather than teach you the basic perturbative qcd techniques .",
    "the selection criterion was as follows .",
    "i have picked the topics that i find puzzling and/or whose importance i feel have not attracted as much attention as they rightfully deserved .",
    "_ the spirits were kind enough to say : + `` we have no respect of cullours '' _",
    "@xcite    in the late 1970s one could say `` qed was 30 years _ old _ '' . in 2003",

    "dating great discoveries is a delicate business , though .",
    "`` the spirit '' in the above charlotte fell - smith s narrative actually was uriel , the one of four archangels responsible for fundamental science ( and physics in particular )  @xcite .",
    "thus the idea of * colour invariance * , as communicated by arch .",
    "uriel to dr .",
    "john dee , may be dated back 420 years ! in 1582 dr .",
    "dee pens down uriel s detailed instructions on arranging the conjuring table :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` _ the sylk must be of diuers cullors : the most changeable that can be got_\\{ten } ''  @xcite .",

    "john dee for the time being and stress that the physics of hadrons always was , and still is , providing puzzles and inspiration .",
    "if 3040 years ago quantum field theory ( qft ) had been kept in higher respect ( which it was not ) , some general phenomenological features of hadron interactions that were known then could have already hinted at qcd as an underlying microscopic theory of hadrons .",

    "if _ we were to employ the standard quantum field theory ( qft ) picture of a particle exchange between interacting objects , @xmath6 _ then _ this called for a spin - one elementary field , @xmath7 , to be present in the theory .",
    "+ _ uniformity in rapidity _ of the distribution of produced hadrons ( feynman plateau ) pointed in the same direction , _ if _ , once again , we were willing to link final particle production to accompanying qft radiation . + _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ @xmath4 .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    nowadays the dossier of puzzles &  hints that the hadron phenomenology has accumulated is very impressive .",
    "it includes a broad spectrum of issues ranging from unexplained regularities in hadron spectroscopy to soft `` forceless '' hadroproduction in hard processes . to locate and formulate a puzzle , to digest a hint ,",
    "these are the road - signs to the hadron chromodynamics construction site .",
    "we are learning to listen . and to hear .      the reason why one keeps talking , 30 years later , about _ puzzles and hints _ , about _ constructing _",
    "qcd rather than _ applying _ it , lies in the conceptually new problem one faces when dealing with a non - abelian theory with unbroken symmetry ( like qcd ) .",
    "we have to understand how to master qfts whose dynamics is intrinsically unstable in the infrared domain : the objects belonging to the physical spectrum of the theory ( supposedly , colorless hadrons , in the qcd context ) have no direct one - to - one correspondence with the fundamental fields the microscopic lagrangian of the theory is made of ( colored quarks and gluons ) .    in these circumstances",
    "we do nt even know how to formulate at the level of the microscopic fields the fundamental properties of the theory , such as conservation of probability ( unitarity ) and analyticity ( causality ) :    * what does _ * unitarity * _ imply for confined objects ? * how does _ * causality * _ restrict quark and gluon green functions and their interaction amplitudes ? * what does the _ * mass * _ of an info  [ well ] identified [ but ] non - flying object ",
    "the issue of quark masses is especially damaging since a mismatch between quark and hadron thresholds significantly affects predicting the yield of heavy - flavored hadrons in hadron collisions . understanding the confinement of colour remains an open problem .",
    "given the present state of ignorance , one has no better way but to circle along the _ guess - calculate - compare _ loop .",
    "there are , however , _ guesses _ and _",
    "guesses_.      perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is believed to govern the realm of `` hard processes '' in which a large momentum transfer @xmath8 , either time - like @xmath9  gev@xmath10 ( jets ) , or space - like @xmath11  gev@xmath10 ( structure functions ) , is applied to hadrons .",
    "pqcd controls the relevant cross sections and , to a lesser extent , the structure of final states produced in hard interactions .",
    "whatever the hardness of the process , it is hadrons , not quarks and gluons , that hit the detectors .",
    "for this reason alone , the applicability of the pqcd approach , even to hard processes , is far from being obvious .",
    "one has to rely on plausible arguments ( completeness , duality ) and look for observables that are _ less vulnerable _ towards our ignorance about confinement .",
    "speaking of substituting _ good guesses _ for _ ignorance _ the following ladder emerges .",
    "* total cross sections . *    the safest bet of all is the idea of _ completeness _ applied to a handful of observables that enjoy the status of `` totally inclusive cross sections '' .",
    "completeness of colour states may be looked upon as a _ good * _ direct _ * guess_. the examples are @xmath12 here one replaces the probability of production of _ hadrons _ by a colorless current @xmath13 ( virtual photon , @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) by that of a @xmath16 pair , @xmath17 and argues that the _ total _ probability of the conversion of quarks into hadrons can not be anything but * 1*. this sounds fine if the momentum transfer to the hadron system , @xmath8 , well exceeds the hadron mass scale @xmath18 .",
    "the guess becomes less _ direct _ when the momentum transfer gets smaller and the final state hadronic system starts to `` resonate '' .",
    "in particular , in the case of the @xmath19 lepton decay width where @xmath20 a point - by - point correspondence between the left and right hand sides of is lost and some `` smearing '' over the invariant mass of the hadron system should be applied . there is a smart way to do this , by referring to the _ analyticity _ in @xmath8 of the correlator of the currents , @xmath21 , which follows from _",
    "causality_. by treading this path one arrives at an amazingly tight control over potentially disturbing non - perturbative effects , which makes the @xmath19 decay a legitimate source of the @xmath22 measurement at pretty small scales ( for details see  @xcite ) .    * dis structure functions .",
    "*    these are not `` totally inclusive cross sections '' , as far as hadrons are concerned , simply because there is a definite hadron in the _ initial _ state .",
    "we are not clever enough to deduce from first principles the parton distributions inside a target hadron ( pdf , or structure functions ) . however , the rate of their @xmath23-dependence ( scaling violation ) is an example of a collinear - and - infrared - safe ( cis ) measure and stays under pqcd jurisdiction .",
    "here one applies a similar logic and appeals to analyticity of the virtual boson ",
    "proton scattering amplitude to translate the bjorken-@xmath24 _ moments _ of the inclusive minkowskian dis cross section ( structure functions ) into euclidean space , the operator product expansion ( ope ) being the name of the game ( a  _ good * _ indirect _ * guess _ ) .    recall that in the bjorken limit ( @xmath25=  const , @xmath26 , that is neglecting corrections in powers of @xmath27 ) one can describe the pattern of the logarithmic deviations from the exact bjorken scaling in terms of probabilistic qcd improved parton picture with cascading quarks and gluons replacing point - like partons of the original bjorken - feynman parton picture .    *",
    "final state ; inclusive . *    the next step down our squeaking ladder of ignorance  and we arrive at inclusive characteristics of hadronic final states produced in hard processes . oops ! here our guesses can not be labeled other than * _",
    "wild_*. there is no _ a priory _",
    "reason for distributions of final hadrons to bear much resemblance to those of underlying partons - dependence of the feynman-@xmath24 moments of fragmentation functions , see below . ] . as we shall discuss below , both the energy and angular distributions of hadrons",
    "_ do _ follow partonic ones .",
    "this fact is well established phenomenologically ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "it does not follow from `` first principles '' , but rather tells us about confinement ( as providing soft , local in the configuration space hadronization of partons ) supporting the original wild guess known under the name of lphd ( local parton ",
    "hadron duality ) hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that the probabilistic parton evolution picture ( the source of inspiration for monte carlo event generators ) is as _ approximate _ as it is _ limited_. strictly speaking , it had been validated for dis sfs  @xcite ( and single - particle inclusive distributions in @xmath28  fragmentation functions  @xcite ) .",
    "no less but no more .",
    "aiming at more than that with mc tools is , strictly speaking , illegitimate .",
    "however this does not mean that a probabilistic treatment can not be somewhat extended beyond its original limits .",
    "a famous example to the contrary is given by the so - called angular ordering ( ao ) story of early 1980s . alfred mueller and victor fadin found that quantum mechanical interferences affect soft gluon cascades in @xmath28 jets and invalidate the classical (= probabilistic ) dglap evolution picture  @xcite .",
    "at the same time they showed that the interference effects could be taken full care of by simply restricting gluon multiplication into successively shrinking angular regions , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 the parent parton and @xmath31 its softer offspring , @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "surprizingly , the ao was later found to work beyond the leading strong ordering approximation ( double logarithmic approximation of strongly ordered energies _ and _ angles , dla ) .",
    "the most natural specification of the ao prescription , @xmath33 , was shown to properly embed the next - to - leading ( single logarithmic , sl ) corrections  @xcite .",
    "this _ exact angular ordering _",
    "rule ( in place of the dl _ strong",
    "_ one ) does the job and restores the probabilistic evolutionary picture for _ energy _ spectra of ( soft ) particles in jets . as far as _",
    "angular _ distributions are concerned , it works , however , only _ on average_. it can not be applied to _",
    "angular correlations_. in particular , quantum - mechanical coherence plays a crucial rle in predicting inter - jet particle flows in multi - jet events .",
    "this is the domain of the so - called string / drag phenomena , of collective radiation effects  qcd radiophysics .    *",
    "final state ; correlations . *",
    "multi - particle correlations are obviously far more vulnerable . even having learned and accepted the god - given lphd in single - particle distributions ( inclusive particle flows ) , we feel at sea when correlations come onto stage",
    ". there may be some good news coming from pqcd approaches to kno , intermittency phenomena and alike  @xcite , but head - on perturbative attacks on correlations fail more often than  not .",
    "george sterman and steven weinberg suggested to look for _ collinear - and - infrared - safe _ ( cis ) observables , those which can be calculated in terms of quarks and gluons without encountering either collinear ( zero - mass quark , gluon ) or soft ( gluon ) divergences .",
    "they proclaimed such observables to be `` more equal '' , free of large distance ",
    "confinement  effects and encouraged us to directly compare corresponding predictions with hadronic measurements  @xcite . this guess ranks higher than _ hypothesis _ : it is rather an _",
    "ideology_.    the sterman ",
    "weinberg ideology gave rise to well elaborated procedures for counting jets ( cis jet finding algorithms ) and for quantifying the internal structure of jets ( cis jet shape variables ) .",
    "they allow the study of the gross features of the final states while staying away from the physics of hadronization .",
    "along these lines one visualizes asymptotic freedom , checks out gluon spin and colour , predicts and verifies scaling violation pattern in hard cross sections , etc .",
    "these and similar checks have constituted the basic qcd tests of the past two decades .    this epoch is over .",
    "now the hep physics community aims at probing genuine confinement effects in hard processes to learn more about strong interactions .",
    "the programme is ambitious and provocative .",
    "friendly phenomenology keeps it afloat and feeds our hopes of extracting valuable information about physics of hadronization .",
    "the quest is not easy , we are bound to make mistakes and are trying to avoid errors .",
    "the original calculation of the electron loop which participates in the polarisation of qed vacuum and makes the coupling run with virtuality , @xmath34 , produced a wrong sign ( in modern words , a qcd - ish @xmath35-function ) . according to the longman dictionary this was an _ error _ , though not a _ mistake _ since it was worth making !",
    "it took a while before some young colleagues pointed out to the matre that he erred .",
    "however the time span proved to be enough for lev landau to develop and enthusiastically discuss with isaak pomeranchuk and their pupils a beautiful physical picture of what is now known to us under the name of `` asymptotic freedom '' .",
    "the seminal paper `` _ on the quantum theory of fields _ '' followed  @xcite .",
    "it has the sign right ; the _ error _ had been corrected `` _ the presence of a finite photon mass would violate the charge conservation law . _ '' [ nope . though their footnote does fully apply to the qcd _ gluon _ mass . what an irony ! ] ] .    in `` _ fundamental problems _ ''",
    "@xcite  a homage to wolfgang pauli ",
    "landau discusses `` _ ` nullification ' of the theory _ '' which is `` _ tacitly accepted even by theoretical physicists who profess to dispute it . _ '' he remarks that `` _ the validity of pomeranchuk s proofs has been doubted_. '' he considers the criticism but asserts that `` _ it therefore seems to me inappropriate to attempt an improvement in the rigor of pomeranchuk s proofs , especially as the brevity of life does not allow us the luxury of spending time on problems which will lead to no new results . _ ''    in the late 1950s the problem was known as `` moscow zero '' : vanishing of the physical interaction ( renormalized coupling ) in the limit of a point - like bare interaction , @xmath36 .",
    "the depth of that crisis can be measured by the dyson prophesy  @xcite that the correct `` meson '' theory  the theory of strong interactions  `` _ will not be found in the next hundred years _ '' and/or by the landau conclusion  @xcite that `` _ the hamiltonian method for strong interactions is dead and must be buried , although of course with deserved honour . _ ''",
    "this was not an _",
    "error_. it was a _",
    "mistake_. but one well grounded .",
    "it was based on pomeranchuk s extensive analysis of all then - known renormalizable theories  with scalar ( @xmath37 ) , yukawa , four - fermion interactions  @xcite . in all these qfts corresponding running couplings _ increased _ with momentum transfer @xmath38 , slowly but catastrophically .",
    "let us not forget the same behaviour of qed  @xcite and an unrealistic but pedagogically valuable lee model  @xcite .",
    "no wonder , the situation looked desperate indeed .",
    "we may guess that landau and pomeranchuk apparently understood too well that search for a `` better '' ( asymptotically free ) theory was unlikely to bear fruit .",
    "the pattern of the fall - off ( _ screening _ ) of the interaction at _ large distances _ ( increase with momentum transfer ) seemed too general to be passed by .",
    "indeed , the vacuum polarisation loop corrections are analytic in @xmath39 ( causality ) . hence",
    "( by crossing - symmetry ) the `` zero - charge '' sign of the @xmath35-function inevitably _ follows _ from positivity of the cross - channel pair production cross section being proportional ( by unitarity ) to the imaginary part of the loop amplitude .",
    "back in 1969 yulik khriplovich demonstrated that in a non - abelian @xmath2 yang  mills gauge theory the coupling constant disrespects this argument  @xcite .",
    "vladimir gribov explained how it dares to do so without violating `` first principles ''  @xcite .",
    "imagine a pair of static colour charges e.g. , heavy quarks interacting via instantaneous coulomb gluon exchange marked `` 0 '' on the adjacent picture .    in the next order in @xmath22",
    "there appears the standard vacuum polarisation correction due to gluon decays into `` physical '' quanta , either a @xmath16 pair or two transverse gluons ( `` @xmath40 '' ) .",
    "they both respect unitarity and give the same - sign contributions to the @xmath35-function as shown on the top part of the picture ",
    "_ screen _ the charge ( as in qed and everywhere else ) .    in qcd",
    "this is not the end of the story however .",
    "there is another type of radiative corrections due to the fact that our coulomb carrier propagates in the `` external field '' of vacuum fluctuations of _ transverse _ quanta .",
    "coulomb gluons couple directly to transverse ones ( whereas photons did not ) .",
    "the first non - vanishing contribution emerges in the second order    in the coupling @xmath41 ( bottom part of the picture ) .",
    "it is large and has the opposite sign corresponding to _ anti - screening_. the origin of the `` opposite sign '' is readily understood  @xcite : it is the same phenomenon that pushes _ down _ the ground state energy of a quantum - mechanical system in the second order in perturbation , @xmath42      given our present awareness of the essential difference between mistakes and errors , an appeal for _ bad guesses _ ( bg ) would not sound provocative . in the first place , one needs bgs to have _ good guesses _ ( gg ) shining ever brighter .",
    "however to avoid slipping toward pr values we had better put forward a more serious argument : one learns by making bad guesses and confronting them with reality .",
    "qcd history is rich in bgs .",
    "let us recall a couple of them .",
    "a celebrated example of a bg is given by the initial parton model picture of how quarks hadronize .",
    "feynman s original idea was that each parton converts into a bunch of hadrons ( with limited transverse momenta and a uniform distribution in @xmath43 )  the feynman _ plateau _ of rapidity length @xmath44 , with @xmath45 the parton energy .",
    "this idea was realised in the very first ( field  feynman ) fragmentation model and was accommodated later by more advanced mc event generators like isajet , cojet . such models today",
    "can be pronounced _",
    "dead _ and to _ be buried , although of course with deserved honour_. they lost the race to the so - called lund string model which was based on the smart decision to take into proper consideration the _ colour topology _ of the underlying multi - parton system  @xcite .",
    "bo andersson , gsta gustafson and carsten peterson chose to view a gluon radiated off a primary @xmath16 pair in @xmath46 as a system of a fake quark and antiquark , @xmath47 .",
    "then with good accuracy ( modulo @xmath48 colour - suppressed correction ) each of the two `` pairs '' @xmath49 and @xmath50 finds itself in a _ colour singlet _ state .",
    "they suggested to treat each `` pair '' according to the field ",
    "feynman prescription ( but in its proper cms ! ) .",
    "this seemingly harmless modification had dramatic consequences .",
    "for one thing , the multiplicity of additional hadrons originating from emission of a hard gluon turned out to be a function of the gluon _ transverse momentum _ ( with respect to the primary @xmath16 ) rather than its cms _ energy _ , @xmath51 .",
    "the crucial rle of colour topology , both for multi - jet event multiplicities and for the pattern of particle flows between jets  the so - called string effect(s )  @xcite , was later confirmed by purely perturbative qcd considerations  @xcite .",
    "another prominent though less known example is provided by the story of the eec ( energy  energy correlation ) measure in @xmath28 annihilation  @xcite .",
    "it was the first cis observable to have been experimentally studied at @xmath28 accelerator petra in desy ( hamburg ) . and with disastrous results .",
    "the `` ideology of infrared stability '' i was praising so above seemed to have failed .",
    "the discrepancy between the pqcd quark  gluon prediction and the measured hadron ",
    "hadron energy weighted inclusive correlation was found to be _",
    "substantial_. worse than that , it turned out to be _ stubborn _ as it refused to go away with increase of the annihilation energy @xmath8 , defying ideology .",
    "now we understand what has happened .",
    "the eec in the back - to - back kinematics turned out to be particularly strongly contaminated by non - perturbative effects  @xcite .",
    "in recent years pqcd has helped us to collect an impressive number of `` _ lost asses _ '' indeed .",
    "however one can not help wondering why the pqcd treatment works so surprizingly well in some cases and fails miserably in others ( often of a similar nature , residing on the same plank of our ladder of ignorance ) ?",
    "it seems the messages are being sent . to grasp them we have to separate , scrutinize and try to classify the `` good '' and `` bad '' cases .",
    "but first we d better agree on the vocabulary .",
    "speaking of `` perturbative qcd '' can have two meanings .",
    "* in a narrow , strict sense of the word , _ perturbative approach",
    "_ implies representing an answer for a ( calculable ) quantity in terms of series in a ( small ) expansion parameter @xmath52 , with @xmath53 the proper hardness scale of the problem under consideration . * in a broad sense , _ perturbative _ means applying the language of quarks and gluons to a problem , be it of perturbative ( short - distance , small - coupling ) or even non - perturbative nature .",
    "the former definition \\{1 } is doomed : the perturbative series so constructed are known to diverge . in qcd",
    "these are asymptotic series of a kind that can not be `` resummed '' into an analytic function in a unique way .",
    "for a given calculable ( collinear- &  -infrared - safe ; cis ) observable  @xcite the nature of this nasty divergence can be studied and quantified as an intrinsic uncertainty of pqcd series , in terms of so - called _ infrared renormalons _  @xcite .",
    "such uncertainties are non - analytic in the coupling constant and signal the presence of non - perturbative ( large - distance ) effects . for a cis observable , non - perturbative physics enters at the level of power - suppressed corrections @xmath54 , with @xmath55 an observable - dependent positive integer number .",
    "meanwhile the broader definition \\{2 } of being `` perturbative '' is bound to be right .",
    "at least as long as we aim at eventually deriving the physics of hadrons from the quark - gluon qcd lagrangian .    to distinguish between the two meanings , in what follows",
    "we will supply the word _ perturbative _ with a superscript or .",
    "thus , when discussing the strong interaction domain in terms of quarks and gluons in what follows we will be actually speaking about perturbatively probing non - perturbative perturbative effects .",
    "_ loke unto thy charge truely : + thow art yet dead .",
    "thow shallt be revyved . _",
    "@xcite    the pictures of the properly measured and properly running perturbative qcd coupling  @xcite are soothing .",
    "experimenters ( as well as theorists ) shy away from looking below 1  . and for a good reason too : how to discuss the strength of interaction between colored objects  quarks and gluons  that supposedly `` do nt exist '' at `` large '' distances corresponding to @xmath56 ?",
    "we may eventually have to .",
    "recall what the renormalization group teaches us about the change of renormalized coupling @xmath57 with the renormalization scale @xmath58 .",
    "this teaching , however , is of limited value .",
    "the momentum variation of @xmath22 is determined by the @xmath35-function , @xmath59 beyond two loops the coefficients @xmath60 with @xmath61 turn out to be _",
    "scheme_- ( and in some schemes even _",
    "gauge_)-dependent ; in other words , arbitrary .",
    "therefore , the large - momentum behaviour of the running coupling @xmath62 can not be uniquely fixed beyond two loops .",
    "the reason for that is pretty simple .",
    "universality is inherited from the basic property of _ ultraviolet renormalizability _ of the theory , and it is only the first two loops that are truly dominated by the uv region , by small - distance physics .    indeed , the one - loop radiative corrections contain the standard logarithmically divergent integral @xmath63 hiding infinity under the carpet produces @xmath64 , the first coefficient in the  @xmath65-function expansion . in the next step",
    "we supply our loop with an additional internal gluon .",
    "now we have two independent loop - momenta to integrate over , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "integration regions @xmath68 could have produced @xmath69 contributions .",
    "these get suppressed by renormalizing the _ internal _ propagators and vertices at the one - loop level , the result being a single - logarithmic integral determined by the region @xmath70 , @xmath71 this is how the usual story goes , order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "we can do better , however , by taking into consideration that the coupling in runs with the internal momentum .",
    "this means reorganising the  series so as to incorporate into the two - loop diagram the higher order effects which result in substituting the running @xmath72 for the constant @xmath57 . by doing",
    "so we obtain a contribution which is still -divergent , though modified by the logarithmic decrease of the coupling at large momenta : @xmath73 renormalizing it out gives rise to @xmath74 . starting from the third loop ( twointernal gluons )",
    "the situation however changes drastically : the -region is no longer dominant , and we get @xmath75 thus starting from the @xmath76 ( next - to - next - leading ) level , a purely perturbative treatment may become intrinsically ambiguous because of an interconnection between small and large distances .",
    "there is no way of unambiguously defining the qcd coupling @xmath22 ( beyond two loops ) without solving the theory in the infrared , that is without understanding the physics of colour confinement .",
    "the quark  gluon picture works rather well across the board .",
    "moreover , in many cases it seems to work _",
    "too well_. this is another worry : too good to be true ai nt good enough .    * too early ? *",
    "the way the differential large angle @xmath77 particle scattering cross sections should scale with energy ( momentum transfer ) was envisaged by the so - called `` quark counting rules ''  @xcite ,    @xmath78 with @xmath79 the number of _ elementary fields _ ( quarks , photons , leptons , etc . ) among  /  inside the initial and final particles .",
    "for example , in the case of the deuteron break - up by a photon , @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 ( a photon and 6 quarks inside the initial deuteron and another 6 in the final proton and neutron ) .",
    "so , the differential cross section is expected to fall with @xmath82 , _ asymptotically _ , as @xmath83 . the key word _ asymptotically _ always provided an excuse for unnerved hep theorists in their encounters with angered experimenters . the jlab plot in fig .  1 which i borrowed from paul hoyer s talk  @xcite seems to be telling us that this standard excuse is unnecessary here .",

    "* the feynman diagram technique has to be reconsidered in qcd if one goes beyond trivial perturbative correction effects .",
    "famous @xmath111 prescription was designed for ( and is applicable only to ) the theories with stable perturbative vacua .",
    "to understand and describe a physical process in a confining theory , it is necessary to take into consideration the response of the vacuum , which leads to essential modifications of the quark and gluon green functions .",
    "there was a deep reason for this turn , which gribov formulated in the following words :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` i found i do nt know how to bind massless _ bosons _ '' _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    ( read : how to dynamically construct _ glueballs _ ) .",

    "spin-@xmath112 particles , even massless which are difficult to localize , can be held together simply by the fact that , if pulled apart , they would correspond to the free - fermion states that are _ occupied _ as belonging to the dirac sea .",
    "thus , light quarks are crucial for gscc .",
    "it is clear without going into much mathematics that the presence of light quarks is sufficient for preventing the colour forces from growing real big : dragging away a heavy quark we soon find ourselves holding a blanched @xmath113-meson instead .",
    "the light quark vacuum is eager to screen any separating colour charges .",
    "the question becomes quantitative : how strong is strong ? how much of a tension does one need to break the vacuum and organize such a screening ?    in a pure perturbative ( non - interacting ) picture , the empty fermion states have _ positive energies _ , while the _ negative - energy _ states are all filled . with account of interaction the situation may change , _ provided _ two _ positive - energy _",
    "fermions ( quarks ) were tempted to form a bound state with a _ negative _ total energy . in such a case ,",
    "the true vacuum of the theory would contain _ positive kinetic energy _",

    "in qft the instability develops when the energy @xmath115 of an empty atomic electron level falls , with increase of @xmath116 , below @xmath117 .",
    "an @xmath28 pair pops up from the vacuum , with the vacuum electron occupying the level : the super - critically charged ion decays into an `` atom '' ( the ion with the smaller charge , @xmath118 ) and a real positron @xmath119 thus , the ion becomes unstable and gets rid of an excessive electric charge by emitting a positron  @xcite in the qcd context , the increase of the running quark - gluon coupling at large distances replaces the large @xmath116 of the qed problem .",
    "gribov generalised the problem of super - critical binding in the field of an infinitely heavy source to the case of two massless fermions interacting via coulomb - like exchange .",
    "he found that in this case the super - critical phenomenon develops much earlier .",
    "namely , a _ pair of light fermions _ interacting in a coulomb - like manner develops super - critical behaviour if the coupling hits a definite critical value @xmath120 in qcd one has to account for the colour casimir operator .",

    "copious production of hadrons is typical for all of them . on the other hand , at the microscopic level",
    ", multiple quark - gluon `` production '' is to be expected as a result of qcd bremsstrahlung ",
    "gluon radiation accompanying abrupt creation / scattering of colour partons .",
    "indirect evidence that gluons are there , and that they behave , can be obtained from the study of the scaling violation pattern .",
    "qcd quarks and gluons are not point - like particles , as the orthodox parton model once assumed . each of them is surrounded by a proper field coat  a coherent virtual cloud consisting of gluons and `` sea '' @xmath122 pairs .",
    "a hard probe applied to such a dressed parton breaks coherence of the cloud .",
    "constituents of these field fluctuations are then released as particles accompanying the hard interaction .",
    "the harder the hit , the larger an intensity of bremsstrahlung and , therefore , the fraction of the energy - momentum of the dressed parton that the bremsstrahlung quanta typically carry away .",
    "thus we should expect , in particular , that the probability that a hit `` bare '' core quark carries a large fraction @xmath123 of the energy of its dressed parent will decrease with increase of @xmath8 .",
    "and so it does .",
    "the logarithmic scaling violation pattern in dis structure functions is well established and meticulously follows the qcd prediction based on the parton evolution picture .    in dis",
    "we look for a `` bare '' quark inside a target dressed one . in @xmath28 hadron annihilation at large energy @xmath124",
    "the chain of events is reversed .    here",
    "we produce instead a bare quark with energy @xmath125 , which then `` dresses up '' . in the process of restoring its proper field - coat",
    "our parton produces ( a controllable amount of ) bremsstrahlung radiation which leads to formation of a hadron jet .",
    "having done so , in the end of the day it becomes a constituent of one of the hadrons that hit the detector .",
    "typically , this is the leading hadron .",
    "however , the fraction @xmath24 of the initial energy @xmath125 that is left to the leader depends on the amount of accompanying radiation and , therefore , on @xmath8 ( the larger , the smaller ) .",
    "in fact , the same rule ( and the same formula ) applies to the scaling violation pattern in @xmath28 fragmentation functions ( time - like parton evolution ) as to that in the dis parton distributions ( space - like evolution ) .",

    "if there were no qcd parton cascading , we would expect the particle _ density _ @xmath204 to be constant ( feynman plateau ) .",
    "it is straightforward to derive that plugging in the dla anomalous dimension ( [ yd_andimdla ] ) results in the plateau density increasing with @xmath53 and with a maximum ( hump ) `` midway '' between the smallest and the highest parton energies , namely , at @xmath205 .",
    "the subleading mlla effects shift the hump to smaller parton energies , @xmath206 with @xmath207 a known analytically calculated number . moreover , defying naive probabilistic intuition , the softest particles do not multiply at all .",
    "the density of particles ( partons ) with @xmath208 stays constant while that of their more energetic companions increases with the hardness of the process @xmath53 .",
    "this is a powerful legitimate consequence of pqcd coherence .",
    "we turn now to another , no less powerful though less legitimate , consequence .      the time - like dla anomalous dimension ( [ yd_andimdla ] ) , as well as its mlla improved version , has a curious property .",
    "namely , in sharp contrast with dis , it allows the momentum integral in ( [ yd_sfandim ] ) to be extended to very small scales . even integrating down to @xmath209 , the position of the `` landau pole '' in the coupling , one gets a finite answer for the distribution ( the so - called _ limiting spectrum _ ) , simply because the @xmath210 singularity happens to be integrable !",
    "it would have been poor taste to trust this formal integrability , since the very  approach to the problem ( selection of dominant contributions , parton evolution picture , etc . )",
    "relied on @xmath22 being a numerically small parameter .",
    "however , the important thing is that , due to time - like coherence effects , the ( still perturbative but `` smallish '' ) scales , where @xmath211 , contribute to @xmath87 basically in a @xmath170-_independent _ way , @xmath212 .",
    "this means that `` smallish '' momentum scales @xmath213 affect only an overall _ normalization _ without affecting the _ shape _ of the @xmath24-distribution .    since such is the rle of the `` smallish '' scales , it is natural to expect the same for the truly small  non - perturbative ",
    "scales where the partons transform into the final hadrons . this hypothesis ( lphd )",
    "reduces , mathematically , to the statement ( guess ) that the factor in ( [ dexp ] ) has a finite @xmath214 limit : @xmath215    in other words , decreasing @xmath161 we start to lose control of the interaction intensity of a parton with a given @xmath24 and @xmath216 ( and thus may err in the overall production rate ) .",
    "however , such partons do not branch any further , do not produce any soft offspring , so that the _ shape _ of the resulting energy distribution remains undamaged .",
    "we see that colour coherence plays here a crucial rle .",
    "thus , according to lphd , the @xmath24-shape of the so - called `` limiting '' parton spectrum which is obtained by formally setting @xmath209 in the evolution equations , should be mathematically similar to that of the inclusive distribution of ( light ) hadrons  @xmath189 .",
    "another essential property is that the `` conversion coefficient '' @xmath217 should be a true constant independent of the hardness of the process producing the jet under consideration .",
    "it is important to realize that knowing the spectrum of _ partons _ , even knowing it to be a cis quantity in certain sense , does not guarantee on its own the predictability of the _ hadron _ spectrum .",
    "it is easy to imagine a world in which each quark and gluon with energy @xmath213 produced at the small - distance stage of the process would have dragged behind its personal `` string '' giving birth to @xmath218 hadrons in the final state ( the feynman plateau ) .",
    "the hadron yield then would be given by a convolution of the parton distribution with a logarithmic energy distribution of hadrons from the parton fragmentation .",
    "if it were the case , each parton would have contributed to the yield of non - relativistic hadrons and the hadron spectra would peak at much smaller energies , @xmath219 , in a spectacular difference with experiment .    physically , it could be possible if the non - perturbative ( ) hadronization physics did not respect the basic rule of the perturbative dynamics , namely , that of colour coherence .",
    "there is nothing wrong with the idea of convoluting time - like parton production in jets with the inclusive  parton@xmath220hadron fragmentation function , the procedure which is similar to convoluting space - like parton cascades with the  initial parton distributions in a target proton to describe dis structure functions .    what the nature is telling us , however , is that this  fragmentation has a finite multiplicity and is _ local _ in the momentum space .",
    "similar to its  counterpart , the  dynamics has a short memory : the  conversion of partons into hadrons occurs locally in the configuration space .",
    "the fact that even a legitimate finite smearing due to hadronization effects does not look mandatory makes one think of a deep duality between the hadron and quark - gluon languages applied to such a global characteristic of multi - hadron production as an inclusive energy spectrum .",
    "the message is , that `` brave gluon counting '' , that is applying the language all the way down to very small transverse momentum scales , indeed reproduces the @xmath24- and @xmath53-dependence of the observed inclusive energy spectra of charged hadrons ( pions ) in jets .",
    "experimental evidence in favour of lphd is mounting , and so is the list of challenging questions to be answered by the future quantitative theory of colour confinement .",

    "it implies that the `` production '' and `` hadronization '' stages of the process can be separated and treated independently .",
    "\\1 . to comply with the first assumption the annihilation energy has to be taken large enough , @xmath224 .",
    "in particular , it fails miserably in the resonance region @xmath225 .",
    "thus , the point - by - point correspondence between hadron and quark cross sections , @xmath226 can not be sustained except at very high energies .",
    "it can be traded , however , for something more manageable .    invoking the dispersion relation for the photon propagator ( causality @xmath4 analyticity ) one can relate the _ energy integrals _ of @xmath227 with the correlator of electromagnetic currents in a deeply euclidean region of large _ negative _ @xmath8 .",
    "the latter corresponds to small space - like distances between interaction points , where the perturbative approach is definitely valid .",
    "expanding the answer in a formal series of local operators , one arrives at the structure in which the corrections to the trivial unit operator generate the usual perturbative   series in powers of @xmath228 ( logarithmic corrections ) , whereas the vacuum expectation values of dimension - full ( lorentz- and colour - invariant ) qcd operators provide non - perturbative   corrections suppressed as powers of @xmath53 .",
