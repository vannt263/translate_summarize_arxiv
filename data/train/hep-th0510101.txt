    "recent advances in precision cosmology and especially the discovery of the acceleration of the universe , has presented cosmology and modern physics with serious challenges .",
    "a model that addresses these challenges at a satisfactory level does not exist yet . by now , many believe that an explanation of the observed anomalies may be rooted in the unknown new physics .",
    "skeptics could equally argue that conventional physics has been as effective as the new physics models in accomodating the data . besides , the latter seems better motivated .",
    "predicting observable imprints of string theory , while neccessary it is not sufficient .",
    "therefore the question : _ how can we distinguish new physics imprints from features of the concordance model _ is of crucial importance .",
    "this question is equivalent to identifying observable effects that are unique to new physics .",
    "string theory is the leading candidate for quantum gravity , thus a positive answer to the above offers a direct evidence for string theory .",
    "here we reviewed the proposal of @xcite that addresses this question based on the analysis of cross - correlations at large scales , of @xmath156 with polarization @xmath153 and lensing potential @xmath157 .",
    "the method described here can potentially provide the first direct evidence for the existence of new physics , as summarized below .",
    "the autocorrelation spectra , @xmath54 can neither discriminate between the sources that seed lss and cmb spectra nor be able to identify a non - inflationary channel because they compare the source to itself .",
    "independent of the potential signatures predicted by string motivated models or observed in autocorrelations , autocorrelations are incapable of providing evidence for new physics , even if it is there .",
    "the @xmath158 correlations can uniquely identify imprints of stringy modifications and discriminate these signatures from features on the inflaton potential because they cross - examine the mismatch in the sources that seed the spectra .",
    "a comparison of @xmath159 reveals whether the sources that seed these spectra differ from one another .",
    "analysis of present data indicates that at least two different sources or equivalently two different scales are required in order to reach agreement with observation .",
    "one of these scales is related to the significance of the isw effect on cmb produced by present acceleration and , the other one is related to modifications of horizon size clustering properties , i.e . at scales",
    "much larger than the recombination era in order to preserve the observed high @xmath34 .",
    "models with features on inflationary potentials ( sect.2 case * a * ) or of early - time brane - worlds ( sec.2 case * b.1 * ) with modified friedman equation which change _ only _ the primordial spectrum , but do not provide additional sources for modifying the late - time evolution and large scale clustering in general are not able to explain the _ high _ @xmath160 and the _ low _",
    "@xmath161 simultaneously .",
    "they are highly disfavored even with present data , fig.[1 - 7 ] .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that string models with early - time effects and inflationary cosmology with modified primordial spectrum offer only one source for seeding all @xmath162 spectra and lss clustering .",
    "it follows that modifying the primordial source by adding features to the inflaton potential , will simultaneously produce the same effect on all other spectra @xmath163 .",
    "a suppression on @xmath164 will also impose a suppression of @xmath165 .",
    "clearly this prediction of conventional single - field inflationary physics is already disfavored by wmap data , fig.[1 - 5].while the @xmath166spectrum is useful in discriminating models , it can not provide conclusive evidence due to degeneracies among cosmic priors as well as the limitations imposed by cosmic variance .",
    "but upcoming weak lensing surveys will provide strong evidence through data for @xmath60 in the existence of more than the primordial spectrum degrees of freedom .",
    "if there is a cuttoff on the inflaton primordial spectrum then correlation @xmath60 should be of order one and @xmath167 spectrum highly suppressed at the cuttoff scale .",
    "string theory can provide a richer poolof sources for the origin of perturbations and clustering at large scales .",
    "it is this fact that contains the unique handle for our method of detection of imprints for string theory .",
    "multi - field inflationary models were not included in this analysis .",
    "after this work appeared @xcite , authors of@xcite extended this analysis to multifield inflation . by aplying various known constraints on isocurvature and multifield inflation scale ,",
    "they reach similar results to ours about the ( dis)agreement of multifield inflationary models with presently available data at large scales .    on the other hand , it is interesting that none of the popular stringy models analyzed , fig[1 - 7 ] , are a perfect match to data",
    ". nevertheless this does not affect any of the conclusions in this work .",
    "the purpose of this analysis was not to advocate or rule out specific models but rather to offer a new method which can make a generic model - independent prediction whether evidence for new physics exists .",
    "once , upcoming data from weak lensing surveys and wmap becomes available then this method can be also used to analyse models on a case by case basis .    with the current data available for the acceleration of the universe and the combined data of cmb+lss",
    ", our result is that the best fit are models that contain two modified sources : a late - time modified friedman equation which uniquely alters the isw effect ; as well as a modified perturbation source which changes the clustering properties at large scales.a generic prediction for this type of string modifications is the lack of correlations between @xmath168 . if weak lensing data finds a suppressed @xmath60 spectrum at large scales than this is strong evidence for the existence of two different sources for @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "models with modified gravity on very large scales and modified clustering look promising .",
    "after all it may not be a coincidence that the accceleration of the universe and cmb power suppression occur at the same scale .",
    "future large scale cosmic shear measurements should be able to see a clear difference between the stringy models and the conventional @xmath135cdm models , with or without modified spectra .",
    "therefore weak lensing at large scales has the potential to provide new important information about our universe .",
    "an improvement of @xmath169 data expected in a near future from wmap will also allow us to better discriminate among various models and mechanisms . with data available in the near future , such as polarization measurements of the cmb by wmap , and weak lensing surveys",
    ", it will be possible to exclude many of the models and collect further evidence for new physics . using the proposal described here",
    "will soon provide a more definite answer to the question : _ do we have observational evidence for string theory in the sky?_.      p.m. garnavich et al , ap.j .",

    "<S> here we discuss recent progress in addressing the above question.the evidence relies on identifying discrepancies between the source terms that give rise to large scale structure ( lss ) and cmb , by cross - correlating the weak lensing potential that maps lss with the cmb spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> 12 pt      progress in string theory and precision cosmology has led to an ambitious investigation of the impact of new physics on cosmological observables . </S>",
    "<S> the ultimate goal of any theory of quantum gravity is to predict a universe that looks like ours , at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> currently string theory is the leading candidate for the anticipated new physics of the quantum gravity realm which , many suspect may hold the key to addressing the outstanding issues emerging in cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the search for signatures of string theory in the cosmological arena is fully justified . </S>",
    "<S> the time to identify such signatures is right . </S>",
    "<S> although searching for imprints of the new physics may be an ambitious goal , the tremendous progress of precision cosmology is bringing this goal within reach .    </S>",
    "<S> testing the theory by observing signatures that are in agreement with the ones predicted by string theoretical models is neccessary but , it can not be considered sufficient evidence for the existence of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is because often the same signature can be predicted by alternative or standard model theories . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a predicted string signature on the temperature anisotropies spectrum can equally be predicted by inflationary physics , with a feature on the inflaton potential . </S>",
    "<S> we are then led to ask : _ can we uniquely identify and discriminate new physics signatures from features of inflationary physics in the presently available observables in the sky ? _ a positive answer would not only further motivate our search for new physics but it would also provide direct evidence for its existence . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , attempting to distinguish whether what is giving rise to these signatures are features of the inflaton @xcite or imprints of new physics @xcite is of crucial importance.this review discusses how the attempts , as recently proposed in @xcite , can be successful . </S>",

    "<S> the step can be chosen to correspond to @xmath43 . </S>",
