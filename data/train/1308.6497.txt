    "in this section we will prove theorem [ mainthm ] , i.e. we will show that if @xmath0 is a knot , then @xmath2 does not split over a group of rank less than @xmath16 .",
    "we will first give a ` classical ' proof for genus - one knots before we provide the proof for all genera .",
    "the main ingredients in the proof are two classical results from 3-manifold topology .",
    "first , we recall the statement of the kneser conjecture , which was first proved by stallings @xcite in the closed case , and by heil @xcite in the bounded case .    * _ ( kneser conjecture)_*[thm : kneserconj ] let @xmath23 be a @xmath24-manifold with incompressible boundary .",
    "if there exists an isomorphism @xmath436 , then there exist compact , orientable @xmath24-manifolds @xmath437 and @xmath438 with @xmath439 , @xmath440 and @xmath441 .    in the following ,",
    "we say that a properly embedded 2-sided annulus @xmath6 in a 3-manifold @xmath23 is _ essential _ if the inclusion map @xmath442 induces a @xmath443-injection and if @xmath6 is not properly homotopic into @xmath444 . the second classical result we will use",
    "is the following , which is a direct consequence of a theorem of waldhausen @xcite ( see corollary 1.2(i ) of @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a genus - one knot .",
    "since @xmath0 is non - trivial , the loop theorem implies that @xmath445 is incompressible .",
    "since knot complements are prime 3-manifolds , it now follows from the kneser conjecture that @xmath2 can not split over the trivial group , i.e. @xmath2 can not split over a free group of rank zero .",
    "now suppose that @xmath446 is a non - trivial knot such that @xmath447 splits over a free group of rank one , that is , over a group isomorphic to @xmath106 . from theorem [ thm : annulus ]",
    "we deduce that @xmath448 contains an essential , properly embedded , 2-sided annulus @xmath6 .",
    "lemma 2 of @xcite ( an immediate consequence of @xcite ) implies that the knot @xmath446 is either a composite or a nontrivial cable knot .",
    "if @xmath446 is a composite knot , then it follows from the additivity of the knot genus ( see , for example , @xcite ) that the genus of @xmath446 is at least two .",
    "moreover , a well - known result of schubert @xcite ( see proposition 2.10 of @xcite ) implies that the genus of any cable knot is greater than one .",
    "thus in both cases we see that @xmath449 .",
    "we introduce the following convention .",
    "if @xmath4 is a group and @xmath450 a representation over a ring , then we denote by @xmath451 also the @xmath106-linear extension of @xmath451 to a map @xmath452 \\to m(k , r)$ ] .",

    "we denote by @xmath458 the free group with generators @xmath459 .",
    "given @xmath460 we denote by @xmath461\\to \\z[f_{k}]$ ] the fox derivative with respect to @xmath462 , i.e. the unique @xmath106-linear map such that @xmath463 for all @xmath464 and @xmath465 .",
    "we denote by @xmath466 the @xmath467-matrix over @xmath452 $ ] of all the fox derivatives of the relators . given subsets @xmath468 and @xmath469 we denote by @xmath470 the matrix formed by deleting the columns @xmath471 and by deleting the rows @xmath472 of @xmath144 .    note that there exists at least one @xmath473 such that @xmath474 .",
    "it follows that @xmath475 we define @xmath476 ( note that each @xmath477 is a @xmath478-matrix . )",
    "it is worth considering the special case that @xmath479 ; that is , the case of a presentation of deficiency one . then the only choice for @xmath446 is the empty set , and hence @xmath480 wada @xcite introduced the following invariant of the triple @xmath481 .",
