    "as is known , dark solitons are fundamental excitations of nonlinear media with modulationally stable background ( see review articles @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "usually their dynamics is modeled by a generalized nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) or gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation with defocusing ( repulsive ) nonlinearity @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the field variable which interpretation depends of the physical system under consideration .",
    "for example , in case of atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) it represents the order parameter ( `` condensate wave function '' ) and then @xmath2 has a meaning of density of atoms , @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the condensate s flow velocity , and @xmath5 is the external potential of forces acting on atoms ( e.g. , the trap potential ) . in nonlinear optics , the fields variable @xmath6 has a meaning of the light field strength , @xmath7 its intensity , @xmath8 plays the role of the coordinate along the light beam , @xmath9 is the radius - vector in transverse directions , and @xmath5 can be related with non - uniformity of a refractive index .    in the most common case",
    "the function @xmath10 corresponds to a repulsive interatomic interaction in bec case or a defocusing kerr nonlinearity in nonlinear optics case . if @xmath6 depends on time and one space coordinate @xmath11 only and the medium is uniform ( @xmath12 ) , then eq .  (",

    "for example , if a dark soliton propagates in bec confined in a cigar - shaped trap , then its dynamics can be described in certain approximation by the following generalization of eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 2 ] ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 in case of a harmonic axial potential .",
    "as was found in @xcite , such a soliton oscillates in a harmonic trap with the frequency @xmath19 , and it was shown in @xcite that this result can be obtained most simply if one considers a dark soliton as a quasiparticle with the energy @xmath20 which expression follows easily from the hamiltonian form of eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 2 ] ) .",
    "then conservation of energy @xmath21 combined with the thomas - fermi ( tf ) distribution of the background density @xmath22 yields at once the equation for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a coordinate of `` position '' of the soliton : @xmath25 this approach was developed in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite where , in particular , its generality was illustrated by application to the case of nonlinearity @xmath26 .",
    "general formulae for the case of arbitrary function @xmath27 ( provided that the condition of modulation stability of the background is satisfied ) were derived later in ref .",
    "it is clear that this approach is correct as long as width @xmath28 of the soliton is much less than a characteristic length at which the background parameters change considerably so that a `` collective '' coordinate @xmath24 is a well - defined variable .",
    "this approach admits also the form of hamilton equations which describe dynamics of the soliton quasiparticle .",
    "indeed , as was shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the momentum of the soliton ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) is equal to @xmath29 and the equation @xmath30 holds which evidently is one of the hamilton equations for the quasiparticle with the hamiltonian ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) . in case of the dark soliton moving through non - uniform bec confined in a trap created by the potential @xmath31",
    "the density @xmath15 is a function of @xmath11 related with @xmath31 by eq .",
    "( [ 3 - 3 ] ) .",
    "hence the hamiltonian becomes a function of the position @xmath32 of the soliton , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is related with the potential @xmath35 by the equation ( [ 3 - 3 ] ) with @xmath11 replaced by the coordinate @xmath32 of the soliton s position .",
    "it is clear that the equation ( [ 3a-2 ] ) does not change provided the derivative in the left - hand side is taken for fixed @xmath32 .",
    "then the second hamilton equation @xmath36 can be readily reduced to @xmath37 that is to the newton equation with the effective mass of the dark soliton quasiparticle equal to the doubled atomic mass as it was first discovered in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in this letter",
    "we show that the approach of refs  @xcite can be easily generalized to multi - dimensional situations of ring or spherical solitons .",
    "for example , if a ring dark soliton evolves in a nonlinear medium , then the speed of its radius @xmath38 , @xmath39 , depends not only on time @xmath8 , but also on @xmath40 .",
    "if the width of the soliton is much less than its radius , then the conservation law of the total energy in the first approximation reads @xmath41 thus , we arrive at a differential equation for @xmath38 which can be easily solved in various situations .",
    "we shall consider here by this method several typical examples .",
    "naturally , in the simplest case of kerr nonlinearity and uniform background our approach reproduces well - known results of ref .",
    "@xcite . in actual optics experiments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) on ring solitons , the photorefractive media with @xmath42 were often used , and in the next section we shall consider evolution of ring dark solitons in such a medium .",
    "evolution of ring dark solitons in bec confined in axially symmetric traps was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite in various approximations .",
    "we show in section 3 that our approach gives a very good approximation ( different from ones discussed earlier ) which agrees quite well with direct numerical solution of the gp equation up to the moment of decay of ring solitons to vortices due to their snake instability .",
    "first , we shall consider the case of uniform background which density ( intensity ) is constant , @xmath43 .",
    "although new results will be obtained for a non - kerr nonlinearity function @xmath27 , we shall begin with the kerr - like case @xmath44 which illustrates very clearly the method .      in case of kerr - like nonlinearity ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) ,",
    "i.e. @xmath44 , the energy of a dark soliton per unit of its length is given by eq .",
    "( [ 3 - 1 ] ) .",
    "hence the total energy of a ring dark soliton with radius @xmath40 is equal to @xmath45 and its conservation law yields the equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the initial radius and velocity of the dark soliton , correspondingly .",
    "this equation was derived first in a different form in @xcite with the use of perturbation theory .",
    "its differentiation with respect to time @xmath8 gives the newton - like equation @xmath50 which has been recently obtained in @xcite as a particular case of equations of contour dynamics of dark solitons .",
    "variable @xmath40 can be excluded from ( [ 4 - 3 ] ) with the help of eq .",

    "( [ 4 - 2 ] ) as the energy conservation law permits us to reproduce very simply the known results .      as was shown in @xcite , in general case the energy of a dark soliton per its unit length can be expressed as @xmath54 where @xmath55d\\rho',\\ ] ] @xmath56 and the minimal value @xmath57 in the distribution of the density @xmath58 across the dark soliton dip is related with its velocity @xmath16 by the equation @xmath59 hence , @xmath60 can be considered as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath53 and , as above , conservation of the total energy of the ring soliton reads @xmath61 this is a differential equation for the function @xmath62 with given initial conditions @xmath63 , @xmath64 at @xmath65 , and its solution describes the evolution of the ring dark soliton . to obtain more definite results",
    ", one should specify the nonlinearity function @xmath27 .      in nonlinear optics experiments @xcite",
    "the nonlinear effects can be modeled by the function @xmath66 which takes into account saturation of the nonlinear response , i.e. @xmath67 as @xmath68 . in this case @xmath69",
    "substitution of this expression into eqs .",
    "( [ 5 - 3 ] ) and ( [ 5 - 6 ] ) yields the function @xmath70 and the resulting differential equation ( [ 6 - 1 ] ) can be solved numerically .",
    "example of such a solution is shown in fig .  1 for the choice of parameters : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",

    "as a typical example , we shall consider the bec confined in an axially symmetric trap .",
    "as above , we assume that cylindrical symmetry persists during evolution so that dynamics of a ring dark soliton reduces to varying of its radius @xmath40 with time @xmath8 . however , now the background density @xmath15 is not uniform and depends on the radial coordinate @xmath77 . in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation and for quadratic nonlinearity @xmath44",

    "the idea that bright solitons behave as `` particles '' goes back to the beginning of modern nonlinear physics . however , it was not so obvious that it could be applied to dark solitons since their behavior depends also on the background evolution .",
