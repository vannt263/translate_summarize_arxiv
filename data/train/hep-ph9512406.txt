    "understanding the spin structure of the nucleon is one of the most important questions in strong interaction physics today .",
    "there has been renewed interest in recent years , largely as a result of a series of high  precision polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments .",
    "so far , the bulk of the information comes from measurements of the spin - dependent structure function @xmath0 . from such measurements ,",
    "spin - dependent parton distributions can be extracted and compared with theoretical models , or used to make predictions for future experiments .",
    "several theoretical issues have received particular attention : the predictions of various sum  rules and the measurement of @xmath1 , the magnitude of the polarized gluon distribution , and the behaviour of the polarized parton distributions at small @xmath2 .    in a previous study @xcite",
    "we performed a global analysis of all available deep inelastic polarized structure function data in the context of the qcd  improved parton model at leading order .",
    "we supplemented the experimental information with theoretical assumptions about the flavour content and the form of the distributions at large and small @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , we presented three different sets of parton distributions characterized by qualitiatively different polarized gluon distributions , and suggested further experiments which could discriminate between them .    since the work of ref .",
    "@xcite there have been several important advances .",
    "more precise polarized structure function data has become available . both the the smc @xcite and slac ",
    "e143 collaborations @xcite have measured the structure function @xmath3 of the deuteron , supplementing their previous proton target measurements , and the slac ",
    "e143 collaboration has also measured the structure function @xmath4 on proton and deuteron targets @xcite .",
    "the new @xmath3 data are particularly important for determining the polarized @xmath5 and @xmath6quark distributions separately .",
    "a second advance has been the theoretical calculation @xcite of the next  to  leading order contributions to the polarized splitting functions @xmath7 which determine the @xmath8 evolution of the distributions .",
    "this not only improves the precision of the phenomenology , but also allows for the first time a consistent factorization / renormalization scheme dependence to be imposed on the analysis .    in this study",
    "we repeat the analysis of @xcite using the new polarized structure function data , but now at both leading and next  to  leading order in perturbation theory . our aim , as before , is to derive a consistent set of polarized parton distributions . at the same time we can check that the @xmath8 dependence seen in the data is consistent with the predictions of perturbative qcd .",
    "we discuss in detail the constraining power of the various data sets , the role of the polarized gluon distribution , and the prospects for future measurements .",
    "a similar analysis of polarized structure functions has been reported recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the ` dynamical parton model ' approach in which the distributions at small @xmath2 are generated dynamically from valence  like distributions at a small starting @xmath9 scale .",
    "a reasonable description of the data is obtained .",
    "our approach , in contrast , is to constrain the small @xmath2 distributions from the data , without prejudice as to the origin of the observed behaviour .",
    "this is in the same spirit as the unpolarized analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we begin by reviewing the basic theoretical input to the analysis .",
    "the fundamental quantity of interest is the structure function @xmath3 which , in analogy with the unpolarized structure function @xmath10 , can ( in the qcd  improved parton model at leading order ) be expressed in terms of the probability distributions for finding quarks with spin parallel or antiparallel to the longitudinally polarized parent nucleon : @xmath11   \\\\ g_1(x , q^2 ) & = & \\half \\sum_q\\ ; e_q^2\\ ;   [ \\delta q(x , q^2 ) + \\delta\\bar q(x , q^2 ) ] , \\label{naiveg1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12    the first moment of @xmath0 measures the expectation value of the axial ",
    "vector current between two identical nucleon states : @xmath13 where the conserved nonsinglet axial vector currents are known from the hyperon decay constants ( the ellis  jaffe sum rule @xcite ) : @xmath14 in contrast , the singlet axial vector current @xmath15 is non  conserved due to the axial anomaly .",
    "it can not be related to any other experimental quantity , although several model  dependent estimates of it can be found in the literature : if the total nucleon spin is carried only by quarks one finds @xmath16 @xcite , and if the strange quark sea in the nucleon is unpolarized then @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "both these estimates are clearly ruled out by experimental measurements @xcite , which find @xmath18 in the range @xmath19 .    in the qcd  improved parton model @xmath3",
    "is expressed in terms of parton distributions for the polarization of quarks and gluons , @xmath20\\ ; \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times   \\left\\{\\delta(1-y ) + { \\alpha_s(q^2 ) \\over 2\\pi } \\delta c_q(y ) + \\ldots \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\ ; \\frac{\\langle e_q^2 \\rangle}{2 } \\int_x^1 \\ ; { dy\\over y}\\ ;   \\delta g(x / y , q^2 ) \\ ; \\left\\ { n_f\\ ;    { \\alpha_s(q^2 ) \\over",

    "although the @xmath22 corrections to the coefficient functions @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite have been known for a long time , a next  to  leading order study was not possible until very recently , as the @xmath22 corrections to the @xmath25 were not known .",
    "these have now been published for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite .    using the next  to  leading order evolution equations @xcite , the _",
    "unpolarized _ parton distributions can be determined to a high level of accuracy ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) using a wide variety of high  precision experimental data from different processes . as the only data available on the spin structure of the nucleon are the structure function measurements of refs .",
    "@xcite , we are still far from obtaining a similar level of precision on the polarized distributions .",
    "the appropriate choice of scheme for @xmath3 in the qcd  improved parton model has been a matter of discussion over the last few years ( see for example @xcite for a recent review ) . the main issue is the treatment of the gluonic contributions to the ellis ",
    "jaffe sum rule .",
    "while the nonsinglet contributions to this sum rule can be related to conserved currents and are unambiguously defined , there is an arbitrariness in the decomposition of the singlet contribution @xcite , depending on the absorption procedure used for the axial anomaly . in the @xmath26 scheme",
    ", this anomaly is absorbed into the next  to  leading order pure singlet quark  to  quark splitting function @xcite .",
    "another possible procedure is to allow for an anomalous gluonic contribution to the ellis ",
    "jaffe sum rule , which is absent in the @xmath26-scheme .",
    "the appropriate scheme transformation @xcite then yields conservation of the quark contribution to @xmath15 . in the present study",
    "we will work entirely in the @xmath26 scheme .",
    "any other choice of scheme would tie the resulting distributions to @xmath3 , as higher  order corrections to the coefficient functions of other processes are so far only known in the @xmath26 scheme . and",
    "the first moment of the polarized gluon distribution . ]    the choice of the @xmath26 scheme also allows us to use our distributions in conjunction with a broad range of unpolarized distributions , the majority of which are defined in this scheme . for reference ,",
    "the @xmath26 scheme coefficient functions in ( [ qcdg1 ] ) are @xmath27    in the following section we will present the results of our leading and next  to  leading order parton model analyses of polarized structure function data .",
    "section  3 discusses the prospects of various future experiments on polarized nucleons and section  4 contains a brief summary and our conclusions .",
    "we adopt a similar approach to the global analysis of unpolarized parton distributions in the nucleon @xcite by parametrizing the polarized distributions at the starting scale in the form : @xmath28 where we take @xmath29  gev@xmath30 .",
    "the normalization factors are @xmath31 which ensures that the first moments of the distributions , @xmath32 , are given by @xmath33 .    various experimental measurements of unpolarized lepton(@xmath34)nucleon and unpolarized drell  yan cross sections yield a reasonably precise flavour decomposition of the light quark @xmath35 sea .",
    "such a decomposition is not yet possible for the polarization of the light quark sea , as measurements of the structure function @xmath3 are only sensitive to the charge weighted sum of all quark flavours , not to the individual distributions .",
    "we therefore assume a su(3)symmetric antiquark polarization @xmath36 .",
    "this _ ad  hoc _",
    "assumption is only justified at the present level of experimental knowledge , and is furthermore immediately broken by next  to  leading order evolution @xcite .",
    "the first moments of the polarized quark distributions can be determined from the measured values of the ellis ",
    "jaffe sum rule . imposing su(3)symmetry at @xmath9 ,",
    "this sum rule reads @xmath37 with @xmath38 in this approach , the first moments of the valence quark polarizations are obtained from the nonsinglet axial ",
    "vector current matrix elements @xcite , while the first moment of the sea quark distribution is inferred from the measured value of @xmath39 . for the leading  order ( lo ) distributions",
    ", we correct the normalization of @xmath40 and @xmath41 by the @xmath42 coefficient function in ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the first moments obtained by this procedure are listed in table  [ tab : fixed ] .",
    "note that the ellis  jaffe sum rule is a ( @xmath8independent ) constant at leading order in perturbation theory , as the leading - order coefficient functions are only expanded up to @xmath43 and scaling violations in @xmath44 arise only from the splitting functions at next  to  leading order .",
    "the polarized gluon distribution enters @xmath0 at next  to  leading order .",
    "it is only very weakly constrained so far , as no experimental data are available on gluon  initiated processes such as direct@xmath45 or heavy meson production .",
    "the polarized gluon distribution @xmath46 is therefore not well  determined by a fit to the @xmath3 data alone , and so additional theoretical constraints have to be applied .",
    "it follows from the structure of the polarized splitting functions that the small-@xmath2 behaviour of the gluon and sea quark distributions are closely correlated , which justifies the assumption @xmath47 in ( [ pform ] ) . in the region @xmath48 ,",
    "structure functions and their evolution are dominated by valence quark contributions , and the impact of the gluon is completely negligible . in ref .",
    "@xcite we explored various possibilities for the form of @xmath46 at large @xmath2 : hard and soft distributions with the spin aligned with that of the parent hadron , and a distribution with the spin anti  aligned .",
    "all three choices give equally good descriptions of the structure function data , but would be relatively easy to discriminate if data on polarized gluon  initiated processes were available .",
    "we adopt the same procedure here , i.e. we consider three equally possible scenarios for the behaviour of @xmath49 , which can be parametrized as follows : @xmath50 due to the introduction of the additional parameter @xmath51 in the starting parametrizations ( [ pform ] ) , these distributions look slightly different from the ones presented in @xcite .",
    "the normalization @xmath52 of the gluon distribution can only be determined consistently from the experimental data in a next  to  leading order analysis , where it still has a large error . at leading order",
    ", we can estimate @xmath52 by attributing _ all _ the violation of the ellis ",
    "jaffe sum rule to a large gluon polarization and vanishing sea quark polarization . in this way",
    "we obtain @xmath53 , only slightly different from the value 1.971 obtained in ref .",
    "note , however , that at leading order the apportioning of the singlet contribution to @xmath39 between gluons and sea quarks is completely arbitrary @xcite .",
    "in fact we shall see below that a consistent nlo treatment gives a value of @xmath52 somewhat less than our estimated leading order value , and similar to the range of values found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if parton distributions are interpreted in the probabilistic picture of the naive parton model , the magnitude of the polarized distributions can not exceed the unpolarized distributions , in order to guarantee positive probabilities for the individual polarization states , i.e. @xmath54 this is in fact only a rigid constraint at leading order , since parton distibutions at higher orders are only scheme ",
    "dependent constants of renormalization and not strict probability densities .",
    "the fundamental constraint at arbitrary orders in perturbation theory is the positivity of physical cross sections for all possible helicity configurations , which does not necessarily imply the positivity of the distributions .",
    "positivity of the polarized distributions is achieved by constraining the parameters of the starting distributions at @xmath9 such that @xmath55 perturbative evolution preserves the positivity of the individual helicity distributions , hence ( [ pos ] ) is fulfilled at any @xmath8 .    in our leading ",

    "all the widely available leading and next  to  leading order distributions provide very good fits to the unpolarized structure function data , and the small differences between them are much smaller than the precision with which the polarized distributions are currently determined .",

    "the starting sea quark distribution of ref .",
    "@xcite contains a very small charm quark contribution which can safely be ignored in the present analysis . to be consistent with the evolution of the unpolarized distributions ,",

    "the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 are constrained to be at least as large as their unpolarized counterparts in the fit , but this constraint has only minimal impact .",
    "we find that only the @xmath69 distribution tends to saturate positivity , requiring the combination @xmath70 to be limited in the fit .",

    "note that small @xmath141 corresponds to large @xmath145 , and the ordering of the asymmetry in this region simply reflects the ordering of the different @xmath146 at large @xmath145 .",
    "due to the relatively large asymmetry of up to 15% , such a measurement could provide vital information on the leading order polarized gluon distribution for @xmath147 and @xmath148 .    in the foreseeable future",
    ", the hera collider may be able to accelerate polarized protons @xcite .",
    "this would offer the unique opportunity of measuring the polarized structure function @xmath114 far beyond the @xmath8 range of present fixed target experiments . in order to judge the quality of the new information gained from such a measurement ,",
    "an order  of  magnitude estimate of the statistical errors is crucial @xcite .",
    "the structure function @xmath114 is extracted from a measurement of the asymmetry @xmath149 where @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) denote the polarizations of the electron ( proton ) beam and @xmath152 is the kinematical depolarization of the photon .",
    "the statistical error on @xmath153 is therefore  @xcite : @xmath154 & = & \\frac{1}{2\\lambda_e \\lambda_p } \\frac{1+(1-y)^2}{1-(1-y)^2 } \\left[2xf_1^p(x , q^2 ) + \\frac{2(1-y)}{1+(1-y)^2 } f_l^p(x , q^2)\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\left ( { \\cal l}_{int } \\int [ \\d^2 \\sigma^{\\rm ( unpol.)}/ ( \\d x \\d q^2 ) ] \\d x \\d q^2 \\right)^{-1/2 } \\sqrt{1-a_{\\parallel}(x , q^2)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the unpolarized differential cross section is integrated over the bin used in the measurement .    to study the accuracy of a measurement of @xmath155 in the collider mode of hera , we have evaluated the above expression using the unpolarized parton distribution set mrs(a@xmath58 ) from ref .",
    "@xcite with the next  to  leading order polarized parton distribution set a described in section 2 .",
    "we apply the following cuts to the hera phase space  @xcite : @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , and consider two scenarios for the beam energies : @xmath160 the expected errors for an integrated luminosity of @xmath161 at @xmath162 in these two scenarios are shown in fig .",
    "we take two bins per decade in @xmath2 and only one bin in @xmath8 .",
    "these results are consistent with the leading  order estimates of @xcite , bearing in mind the different cuts applied .",
    "in particular , we estimate smaller errors in the small@xmath2 region , as we apply no cuts on the hadroinc final state .",
    "the average @xmath8 values probed at hera range from @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) to @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) for @xmath167 and from @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) to @xmath170 ( @xmath166 ) for @xmath171 . for reference , we also show in fig .  6 a parametrization of @xmath114 obtained from the nlo set a. to illustrate the impact of a measurement at hera , we include the three lowest datapoints reported by the smc experiment @xcite , corresponding to @xmath8 values around @xmath172 .",
    "it is apparent that a measurement at lower beam energies will yield data of higher statistical quality . in contrast",
    ", the higher beam energies yield a measurement at smaller @xmath2 .",
    "a measurement of @xmath114 at the hera collider will evidently not provide a large number of precision data on the @xmath2 and @xmath8 dependences of this structure function .",
    "hence , it will not provide sufficient information for an indirect determination of the polarized gluon density .",
    "the important physics result of such a measurement is the determination of the small@xmath2 behaviour of @xmath114 , for which various , significantly different predictions exist @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that a measurement of @xmath114 at small @xmath2 will reduce the experimental uncertainty on the ellis ",
    "jaffe sum rule .",
    "the impact of the small @xmath2 region can be easily seen in fig .",
    "6 , as the ellis ",
    "jaffe sum rule is proportional to the area enclosed by @xmath173 and the @xmath2 axis .",
    "a final remarkable point on the measurability of @xmath114 at hera is the impact on the statistical error of the minimum cut on @xmath174 . as the photon depolarizes for small @xmath174 , a small cut on @xmath174 ( such as @xmath175 ) diminishes the statistical accuracy , even though more data are included in the bin .",
    "we find that a minimal cut on @xmath174 between 0.1 and 0.2 yields the optimal accuracy .",
    "we have performed leading and next  to  leading order qcd fits to the world data on the @xmath3 polarized structure function measured with proton , neutron and deuteron targets .",
    "the quality of the fits is excellent , and from them we obtain sets of polarized parton distributions which can be used for further phenomenological analyses .",
    "the experimental precision is highest for the proton and deuteron data , and together these constrain the shapes of the valence @xmath5 and @xmath6 distributions .",
    "the sea quark and gluon distributions are still largely undetermined .",
    "there is a weak constraint on the overall size of the former , but almost no information at all on the flavour decomposition of the sea .",
    "following our earlier work , we have presented three qualitatively different gluon distributions , characterized by different behaviours at large @xmath2 .",
    "it seems that further progress in the determination of polarized parton distributions will require measurements other than @xmath3 at fixed",
    " target experiments .",
    "inelastic @xmath116 photoproduction in lepton ",
    "hadron scattering has already proved capable of measuring the unpolarized gluon distribution , and a similar measurement with a polarized beam and target would provide the first real information on @xmath46 .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath82 can help to estimate the overall amount of gluon polarization at higher and medium @xmath2 .",
    "althogh present experiments can not provide such a measurement due to low statistics or too low values of @xmath8 , first information can be expected from the next generation of fixed target experiments .",
    "we have also studied the accuracy of a measurement of @xmath0 at the hera collider with polarized beams .",
    "such a measurement will help to discriminate between various predictions for the behaviour of @xmath0 at small @xmath2 , and will reduce the uncertainty on the ellis  jaffe sum rule from the extrapolation to small @xmath2 .",
