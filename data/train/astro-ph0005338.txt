    "pulsed high - energy emission from millisecond ( ms ) pulsars has so far been detected at x - ray energies below @xmath6 10 kev for only five pulsars : psr j0437 - 4715 ( @xcite ) , psr j2124 - 3358 ( @xcite ) , psr b1821 - 24 ( @xcite ) , psr j0218 + 4232 ( @xcite ) and psr b1937 + 21 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first two exhibit broad x - ray pulses , have soft spectra and relatively low luminosities in the x - ray window , about 3 orders of magnitude lower than derived for the latter three ( @xmath7 assuming emission in a 1 sr beam ) .",
    "in addition to the higher luminosity , these have very narrow x - ray pulses ( intrinsically @xmath8 or narrower ) and hard power - law shape spectra measured up to @xmath6 10 kev ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , respectively ) , the two hardest spectra having indices as hard as @xmath6 -0.65 .",
    "this short observational summary suggests that this small sample can de devided in two distinct classes of ms pulsars : _ class _ i , ms pulsars with soft , low - luminosity x - ray emission in broad pulses ; _ class _ ii , with highly non - thermal , high - luminosity x - ray emission in narrow pulses .",
    "millisecond pulsars not only differ from normal radio pulsars in that their spin periods are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude shorter , reducing correspondingly their light cylinder radii , but particularly their surface magnetic field strengths are 3 to 4 orders of magnitude weaker .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite and @xcite showed that both of the competing classes of models for the production of @xmath0-rays ( polar cap and outer gap models ) predict the production of detectable non - thermal emission up to the high - energy @xmath0-rays for a sizable number of ms pulsars .",
    "an early systematic search for pulsed high - energy @xmath0-ray emission from ms pulsars rendered , however , only upper limits ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we will present circumstantial evidence for the first detection of pulsed high - energy gamma - ray emission from a _ class _ ii ms pulsar : psr j0218 + 4232 .",
    "psr j0218@xmath14232 is a 2.3 ms pulsar in a two day orbit around a low mass ( @xmath6 0.2 m@xmath9 ) white dwarf companion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the dipolar perpendicular magnetic field strength ( @xmath10 ) at the surface of the neutron star is estimated to be @xmath11 g and the spin - down age is @xmath12 years .",
    "the spin - down energy loss @xmath13 of the pulsar amounts @xmath14 erg s@xmath15 .",
    "the pulsar distance inferred from its dispersion measure and from the electron density model of @xcite is @xmath16 kpc .",
    "soft x - ray emission from the pulsar was first detected by @xcite in a 20 ks rosat hri observation . in a 100 ks follow - up observation",
    "x - ray pulsations were discovered at a significance of about 5 @xmath17 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray pulse profile is characterized by a sharp main pulse with an indication for a second peak at a phase separation of @xmath18 . the pulsed fraction inferred from the rosat hri ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev )",
    "data is @xmath19 % .",
    "it is interesting to note that also in the radio domain the source exhibits an unusually high unpulsed component of @xmath6 50 % ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rosat hri provides no spectral information and the number of counts recorded in a far off  axis pspc observation does not allow spectral modeling in the soft x - ray regime ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) .",
    "also asca detected this source , however , the observation was too short : no pulsation could be detected , and a spectral fit to the weak total excess resulted in a power ",
    "law photon index of @xmath20 ( kawai & saito 1999 ) .",
    "the spectral information for psr j0218@xmath14232 improved enormously analyzing the data from a 83 ks bepposax mecs ( 1.6 - 10 kev ) observation performed early 1999 ( @xcite ) .",
    "pulsed emission was detected up to 10 kev , the pulse profile clearly showing two peaks at the same phase separation of 0.47 which we reported earlier combining rosat hri and pspc observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bepposax mecs observation reveals that psr j0218@xmath14232 exhibits the hardest pulsar x - ray spectra measured so far : between 1.6 and 10 kev one peak has a spectrum consistent with a power - law photon index of @xmath21 and the other with an index of @xmath22 .",
    "the total pulsed spectrum can be described with an index @xmath23 ( @xcite ) .    at high - energy @xmath0-rays , @xcite noticed the positional coincidence of psr j0218@xmath14232 with the second egret catalog source 2eg j0220@xmath14228 ( @xcite ) , which was identified in the catalog and other publications with the bl lac 3c 66a ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . using some additional egret observations , and applying a combination of spatial and timing analyses , @xcite",
    "conclude that 2eg j0220@xmath14228 is probably multiple : between 100 and 1000 mev psr j0218@xmath14232 is the most likely counterpart , and above 1000 mev 3c 66a is the best candidate counterpart .",
    "the third egret catalog ( @xcite ) , which is based on more viewing periods than the 2eg catalog , also identifies 3eg j0222@xmath14253 ( 2eg j0220@xmath14228 ) with 3c 66a , rather than with the ms - pulsar .",
    "however , in a note on this source , they indicate that the identification with 3c 66a stems from the catalog position based on the @xmath24 1 gev map .",
    "furthermore , they confirm that for lower energies ( 100 - 300 mev ) the egret map is consistent with all the source flux coming from the pulsar , 3c 66a being statistically excluded .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of spatial , timing and pulse - phase resolved spatial analyses using all available egret ( 30 mev - 30 gev ) data collected between november 1991 and november 1998 in 5 observations with psr j0218@xmath14232 within 25@xmath25 of the pointing axis .",
    "analysis of radio monitoring data of this pulsar provided us with an ephemeris valid over the total period of 7 years covering the egret observations , allowing phase folding of all selected egret events in a single trial .",
    "the resulting high - energy @xmath0-ray pulse profile is compared with pulse profiles detected at x - ray energies up to 10 kev , and in absolute phase with the radio profile at 610 mhz .",
    "the results are finaly discussed in relation to the _ class _ ii ms pulsars and the crab , as well as with recent theoretical predictions for the production of x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission in the magnetospheres of ms pulsars .",

    "egret ( the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ) aboard the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) has a ( gas - filled ) sparkchamber and is sensitive to gamma - rays with energies in the range 30 mev to 30 gev . in the mode used for most of the observations",

    "comptel , the imaging compton telescope aboard cgro , is co - aligned with egret and had psr j0218@xmath14232 in its field of view during the same vp s as egret .",
    "comptel operates in the 0.75 - 30 mev energy window and has an energy resolution of about 5 - 10 % fwhm , a large field of view ( @xmath47 steradian ) and a location accuracy of @xmath48 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "events are time - tagged with a @xmath49 ms resolution .",
    "a timing analysis of psr j0218 + 4232 in the comptel energy window did not yield a significant timing signal and subsequent imaging studies of the sky region containing psr j0218@xmath14232 did not show a source detection at the pulsar position .",
    "therefore , only the flux upper limits are presented in this paper ( see sect . 8) .",
    "osse , the oriented scintillation spectrometer experiment aboard cgro , is a non - imaging detector system consisting of 4 independent actively shielded nai(tl)-cs(na ) phoswich detectors operating in the 0.05 to 10 mev energy range , each having a @xmath50 ( fwhm ) field of view ( see @xcite ) .",
    "psr j0218 + 4232 was the primary target of osse during vp 728.7 and vp 728.9 and was observed in event - by - event mode in the 50 - 150 kev energy band with a timing accuracy of 0.125 ms .",

    "the longitude and latitude bin widths are @xmath40 , and 10 narrow `` standard '' energy ranges are selected : 30 - 50 , 50 - 70 , 70 - 100 , 100 - 150 , 150 - 300 , 300 - 500 , 500 - 1000 mev , 1 - 2 , 2 - 4 and 4 - 10 gev .    because the earth atmosphere is the largest source of non - celestial @xmath0-rays the events are subjected to an energy dependent zenith angle cut .",
    "we used the `` standard '' values for the 10 selected energy windows .",
    "the corresponding energy dependent exposure maps are calculated using the `` exposure history '' files taking into account the instrument calibration characteristics , the instantaneous timeline , the operation mode of the instrument and the time dependent spark chamber sensitivity factors ( see @xcite and table 1 ) .    to be consistent with the selection criteria used in the generation of the exposure matrices we demand that the energy deposit in the tasc ( total absorption shower counter ) measured by at least one of its pha s is above a threshold of @xmath52 mev .",
    "the imaging method employed here is based on our maximum likelihood ratio ( mlr ) program , part of the comptel analysis software package compass ( @xcite ) . in this program point",
    "sources are searched for on top of a diffuse background model which describes the galactic and extra - galactic @xmath0-ray emission separately .",
    "the galactic component originating in cosmic - ray interactions with the protons of the atomic and molecular hydrogen gas , as well as inverse compton interactions of cosmic - ray electrons with the ambient photon field , is described by a combination of 2 different models : one results from the convolution of the egret psf with the spatial distribution of the atomic hydrogen column density and the second from the convolution with the spatial distribution of co used as tracer for the molecular hydrogen gas in the galaxy .",
    "the extra - galactic component is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "the image resulting from the maximum likelihood ratio program is based on likelihood ratio tests at user defined grid points in a skyfield containing the object of interest . at each grid point ( @xmath53 ) we determine the maximum likelihood under two hypotheses : 1 ) a description of the data in terms of the diffuse background models only ( @xmath54 ) and 2 ) a description in terms of the diffuse background models and a point source at the ( @xmath53 ) position ( @xmath55 ) . under the @xmath55 hypothesis",

    "because our mosaic of observations is composed of viewing periods with pointing directions concentrated in a narrow band at low galactic latitudes ( see table [ obs_table ] ) the @xmath61 scale factors are poorly constrained in the optimization process due to the dominating galactic components .",
    "so , we keep them _ fixed _ at values derived from a study of the extra - galactic @xmath0-ray emission using a much larger database containing all egret cycle i ,",
    "ii and iii observations ( @xcite ) .    by optimizing the likelihood under @xmath55 with respect to its free scale parameters , @xmath62 we can derived the flux and flux uncertainty from @xmath17 and its error for a putative source at position ( @xmath53 ) . from optimizations under @xmath55 and @xmath54",

    "the binned event matrix for this integral energy window is a combination of the matrices for the differential energy windows above 100 mev , each with a different earth zenith cut angle .",
    "the @xmath66 mev exposure matrix is in this case a power - law weighted composition ( index @xmath452.1 ) of the differential exposure matrices .",
    "this forms a consistent event / exposure set with respect to the applied selection criteria .",
    "we compared the derived optimum scale factors for the galactic diffuse emission components with the findings from more detailed studies on this diffuse emission ( @xcite , @xcite ) and found that our values are in all cases consistent with the published results .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] that the high - energy @xmath0-ray source is positionally consistent with both psr j0218 + 4232 and 3c 66a ( located at ( l , b ) = ( 140.143,@xmath4516.767 ) ) .",
    "the total excess contains @xmath68 counts .",
    "we analyzed this excess also in the differential energy windows : 100 - 300 mev , 300 - 1000 mev and 1 - 10 gev .",
    "in each window the source was seen : 100 - 300 mev @xmath69 detection significance and @xmath70 counts , 300 - 1000 mev @xmath69 and @xmath71 counts and finally 1 - 10 gev @xmath72 and @xmath73 counts .",
    "the location confidence contours for the excesses in the 3 broad energy windows are shown in fig .",

    "this figure shows that 3c 66a is the evident counterpart for the 1 - 10 gev window ( consistent with the third egret catalogue results ( @xcite ) , whereas psr j0218 + 4232 is the most likely counterpart for the 100 - 300 mev window .",
    "between 300 and 1000 mev both sources contribute to the excess .    for energies below 100 mev we see indications for an excess , but the egret sensitivity is becoming too low and the spatial response too wide to draw firm conclusions .",
    "we estimated a @xmath74 flux upper limit for the spectrum of psr j0218@xmath14232 ( see sect .",
    "earlier studies of @xmath0-ray emission from spin - down powered pulsars showed that they are _ steady _ @xmath0-ray emitters ( see e.g. the review by @xcite ) . on the contrary",
    ", most active galactic nuclei appeared to be highly variable at @xmath0-ray energies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we investigated whether there is ( absence of ) evidence for time varability of 2eg j0220 + 4228 / 3eg j0222 + 4253 , particularly for the 100 - 300 mev and 1 - 10 gev bands , in which psr j0218 + 4232 and 3c 66a appear to be the most likely counterparts , respectively .    using integration intervals of typically 2 or 3 weeks",
    ", the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : timevar ] .",
    "the 100 - 300 mev flux measurements are fully consistent with being constant , as expected for @xmath0-ray emission from spin - down powered pulsars .",
    "the 1 - 10 gev flux points show indications for variability and deviate at a @xmath75 level ( 93% ) from being constant . according to the variability criteria defined by @xcite the 1 - 10 gev variability index @xmath76 of 1.33 points to a variable nature of the 1 - 10 gev emission .",
    "this type of variability is indeed reminiscent of the behaviour observed frequently for the @xmath0-ray emission from agn .",
    "the above supports the conclusion from the spatial analysis , namely , that 2eg j0220 + 4228 / 3eg j0222 + 4253 is multiple : above 1 gev the bl lac 3c 66a is the obvious counterpart , whereas below 300 mev psr j0218 + 4232 is the most likely counterpart .",
    "in the timing analysis similar event selections have been applied as in the spatial analysis , except we ignored the specific tasc ( @xcite ) flags of the event triggers in the event selection process .",
    "especially the selection on the tasc zero cross overflow bit ( set to 1 if less than 6.5 mev is deposited in the tasc ) , which is only effective for the lower energy @xmath0-ray photons ( @xmath77 mev ) , is not taken into account .",
    "we verified this selection by a timing analysis of the crab pulsar ( combining many cycle 0 @xmath45 vi vp s ) which showed that ignoring the tasc flags gives a significant improvement of the timing signal , particularly for energies below 100 mev , with respect to the case in which we demand a tasc energy deposit of at least 6.5 mev measured by one of its 2 pha s .",
    "an additional difference in the selection procedure with the spatial analysis , where the spatial information of all events is used , is that we now have to specify an event extraction radius around the pulsar position .",
    "contrary to what is commonly used in the timing analysis of egret data , namely , selecting events within an energy dependent extraction radius @xmath78 of @xmath79 containing approximately @xmath37 of the counts from a point - source , with @xmath80 the measured @xmath0-ray energy , we optimized in each narrow energy window ( e.g. 100 - 150 mev ) the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath81 as a function of extraction radius taking into account the modelled ( 2d ) spatial distribution of the optimized diffuse models and neighbouring sources as obtained in the spatial analysis ( see e.g. the thesis of @xcite p.49 - 50 ) .",

    "contrary to the phase folding we need to select the events in relatively broad phase intervals to have sufficient statistics to do the spatial analysis : we selected 10 phase bins of width 0.1 .    in order to estimate first the contribution of 3c 66a , which is obviously independent of the pulsar phase , to the total high - energy @xmath0-ray excess in the 100 - 1000 mev energy band we have fitted this excess for the full [ 0,1 ] phase range in terms of point - sources at the positions of psr j0218 + 4232 and 3c 66a .",

    "<S> we report circumstantial evidence for the first detection of pulsed high - energy @xmath0-ray emission from a millisecond pulsar , psr j0218@xmath14232 , using data collected with the energetic gamma ray experiment ( egret ) on board the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) . </S>",
    "<S> the egret source 3eg j0222 + 4253 is shown to be spatially consistent with psr j0218@xmath14232 for the energy range 100 - 300 mev . above 1 gev </S>",
    "<S> the nearby bl lac 3c 66a is the evident counterpart , and between 300 mev and 1 gev both sources contribute to the @xmath0-ray excess . folding the 100 - 1000 mev photons with an accurate radio ephemeris of psr j0218@xmath14232 </S>",
    "<S> yields a double peaked pulse profile with a @xmath2 modulation significance and with a peak separation of @xmath3 similar to the 0.1 - 10 kev pulse profile . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison in absolute phase with the 610 mhz radio profile shows alignment of the @xmath0-ray pulses with two of three radio pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity of the pulsed emission ( 0.1 - 1 gev ) amounts @xmath4 which is @xmath5 % of the pulsar s total spin - down luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of the x - ray and @xmath0-ray pulse profile shapes of psr j0218@xmath14232 , and the apparent alignment of the @xmath0-ray pulses with two radio pulses at 610 mhz , bears resemblance to the well - known picture for the crab pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> this similarity , and the fact that psr j0218@xmath14232 is one of three millisecond pulsars ( the others are psr b1821 - 24 and psr b1937 + 21 ) which exhibit very hard , highly non - thermal , high - luminosity x - ray emission in narrow pulses led us to discuss these millisecond pulsars as a class , noting that each of these has a magnetic field strength near the light cylinder comparable to that for the crab . </S>",
    "<S> none of the current models for @xmath0-ray emission from radio pulsars can explain the @xmath0-ray spectrum and luminosity of psr j0218@xmath14232 . </S>"
