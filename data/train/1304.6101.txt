    "s theorem see e.g. @xcite*chapter iii .",
    "the inequality @xmath7 is an easy corollary of the riemann - roch theorem and also the characterisation of special linear systems @xmath3 on a hyperelliptic curve can be obtained directly from the riemann - roch theorem .    in @xcite",
    "one proves a riemann - roch theorem for finite graphs and in @xcite , @xcite one proves a riemann - roch theorem for metric graphs and for tropical curves . in particular",
    "the inequality @xmath7 for a special @xmath6 on such structure follows immediately . in @xcite",
    "one gives a description of the special linear systems @xmath3 on such structure in case there exist a @xmath4 .",
    "now we are going to prove that , in case such structure has a @xmath3 for some @xmath10 , then there exists a @xmath4 , thereby obtaining a complete clifford s theorem for such structures .    in order to mention the main steps of the proof we give a proof of a part of clifford s theorem for the classical case of curves that will be the prototype for the proof for metric graphs .",
    "so assume c is a smooth curve of genus @xmath1 possessing a @xmath3 with @xmath10 .",
    "we are going to prove that @xmath5 has a @xmath11 .",
    "take @xmath12 general and take @xmath13 such that @xmath14 . from the riemann - roch theorem",

    "since @xmath27 is contained in the fixed divisor of @xmath55 and @xmath56 the linear system @xmath57 has a fixed point .",
    "this proves @xmath5 has a @xmath11 .",
    "the advantage of this proof for adaptation to the case of metric graphs is that it makes no explicit use of linear algebra as in the proof given in e.g. @xcite*chapter iii . in the case of metric graphs",
    "it is not clear how to adapt those linear algebra techniques in a suitable way .",
    "a remaining difficulty is the use of fixed divisors in the above given proof . in the case of curves , if @xmath58 is an effective divisor such that @xmath59 then for all @xmath60 one has @xmath61 . for metric graphs",
    "this is not true any more .    in the first part of the proof , for a metric graph @xmath0 we describe a situation that is very similar to the situation of curves .",
    "in that situation we obtain corresponding effective divisors @xmath62 and @xmath63 of degree @xmath64 together with decompositions @xmath19 and @xmath20 using @xmath3 and @xmath65 such that the linear systems associated to those divisors do not contain other divisors . this description and the rest of the proof makes intensive use of the abel - jacobi maps as defined in @xcite . in the second part of the proof , within this situation we can repeat the first steps of the proof for the case of curves . then in order to avoid the use of the fixed divisor of a linear system , we start making more complicated arguments . from those aguments , using a rank determining set described in @xcite , one obtains the remaining part of the clifford s theorem .",
    "so clearly the proof is not a direct corollary of using the riemann - roch theorem .",
    "the case of tropical curves is an immediate corrolary of the case of metric graphs .",

    "@xmath148 by @xmath149 ) we obtain a similar conclusion but it is important that we use the same @xmath146 ( resp .",
