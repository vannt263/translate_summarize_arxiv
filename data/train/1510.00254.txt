    "numerical models of solar flares are presently to a large extent consistent with basic observational properties of the observed events .",
    "they are widely utilized to understand the main physical processes occurring in solar flares , such as magnetic reconnection , generation of highly variable beams of high - energy non - thermal electrons ( ntes ) , interactions of the ntes with flaring plasma , plasma dynamics and evolution , energy emission and many others .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the ntes move along the magnetic field lines towards the chromosphere and photosphere and deposit their energy in cascaded coulomb collisions with dense plasma . in the course of the bremsstrahlung process part of the energy carried by ntes",
    "is emitted as hard x - rays ( hxr ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "rapid deposition of energy by ntes inevitably results in the localised accumulation of internal energy that is not radiated away by plasma in sufficiently short time scales .",
    "it causes an abrupt increase of the plasma temperature and its expansion dynamically upward into the corona in the course of the process called chromospheric evaporation @xcite .",
    "highly variable emissions of plasma arise simultaneously over the entire electromagnetic spectrum from gamma - rays up to radio waves .",
    "the temporal evolution of mass density , temperature , gas pressure , velocity , and other macro- and micro - parameters of the flaring plasma depends on various interrelated physical processes of energy deposition , transport , interactions of the plasma with magnetic fields , radiation processes , heat conduction and many others .",
    "the variations of the plasma parameters also have an influence on positions and sizes of the energy deposition volumes , the net energy budget of the whole events , plasma dynamics and time scales of variations of properties of solar flares ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , soft x - ray ( sxr ) emissions , mostly thermal in origin , are directly related to momentary distributions of the mass density ( emission measure ) and temperature of the expanding plasma along the whole flaring loop .",
    "solar flaring loops possess a multi - thread internal structure , _",
    "i.e. _ they consist of bundles of fine magnetic ropes , which are poorly resolved by contemporary instruments @xcite .",
    "there are no means to observe and to investigate heating episodes and thermodynamic evolution of the individual threads .",
    "these observational limitations cause fundamental problems in accurate numerical modelling of flaring loops , including selection of a relevant structure and number of threads as well as a proper spatial and temporal model of energy deposition in each individual thread .",
    "most of the former studies based on hydrodynamic simulations of solar flares are not able to account for a temporal evolution of the observed emissions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many hydrodynamic simulations indicate that as a result of effective energy loss caused by thermal conduction and broadband thermal radiation , the high - density flaring plasma should cool rapidly , on time - scales of minutes .",
    "however , the observed sxr thermal emission of solar flares usually persists for hours @xcite , powered by an extended phase of low - energy reconnections ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or being a direct result of a multi - thread internal structure of the flaring loops @xcite .",
    "the relative shares of various mechanisms of a transfer and redistribution of the energy already deposited in the flaring loops are not clear , conduction and various kinds of waves can be present simultaneously in these magnetic structures . while the physical mechanisms and processes involved in abrupt heating of the flaring plasma are still not fully understood , a potentially fruitful method to study the flare physics is a comparison of the evolved observational features of the flaring transient plasma with the data provided by the numerical models of the flares , including relevant processes and physical mechanisms . in the general scenario , the hydrodynamic ( hd ) and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of the impulsively heated solar active region loops , which are the fundamental building blocks of the corona , are important in order to understand plasma evolution , heating , and cooling @xcite . in the ideal mhd approximation ,",
    "several case studies were also proposed to understand the physics of plasma dynamics in the post - flare loops as well as active region magnetic arches ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references cited therein ) .    in this work we present a set of 1d hydrodynamic ( hd ) and 2d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models of a prototypical flaring loop with the aim of comparing plasma parameters variations and flare evolutions .",
    "initial physical and geometrical parameters of the flaring loop are set according to the observations of a progenitor m1.8 flare recorded in the ar10126 active region on september 20 , 2002 between 09:21 ut and 09:50 ut ( see figs .  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the modeled loop was embedded into the realistic temperature model of the solar atmosphere that is smoothly extended below the photosphere .",
    "the non - ideal 1d models include thermal conduction and radiative losses of the optically thin plasma as energy loss mechanisms , while the non - ideal 2d models take into account viscosity and thermal conduction as energy loss mechanisms , which are currently implemented in the applied numerical code .",
    "the energy was delivered to the finite regions of the loop , which are selected , for various models , from the upper chromosphere up to the low corona .    in our work",
    "we investigate various scenarios of the evolution of a typical flaring loop , of reasonable values of the main physical parameters , such as half - length ( _ i.e. _ the distance between a foot and a top of a loop ) , apparent diameter , and energy delivered during a heating episode .",
    "the applied time evolution of the delivered energy flux mimics only average , typical variations of energy fluxes observed in solar flares , including a gradual growth phase , impulsive phase and gradual decay phase .",
    "we developed a broad set of models , for which the energy deposition regions are of a limited size and are located at a selected , fixed height .",
    "such diversity of the position of the energy deposition volumes reflects various parameters of the ntes beams , particularly various hardness of the ntes energy spectra .",
    "the actual positions of the energy deposition volume , applied in each model are selected so that they overlap the position of the energy deposition region which is estimated with the use of the 1d hd model of a flare ( see falewicz et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "thus , synthetic fluxes calculated in any spectral domain for the investigated flare could not be similar to real fluxes recorded for any real solar event , including also the progenitor flare .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the solar flare prototype is described in section 2 .",
    "numerical models and applied assumptions are presented in section 3 .",
    "the obtained results are reported in section 4 .",
    "the paper is summarized by discussion of the results and conclusions in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "as a prototype of a solar flare , which ensures reasonable geometrical and physical parameters of the modeled flaring loop , we use the m1.8 class solar flare in noaa ar 10126 ( s23e69 ) on september 20 , 2002 at 09:21 ut , according to goes catalogue ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "basic initial physical and geometrical parameters of the flare are estimated using the observational data recorded by the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( _ rhessi _ ) , euv imaging telescope ( eit ) onboard solar and heliospheric observatory ( _ soho _ ) , and geostationary operational environmental satellite ( _ goes _ ) .",
    "the _ rhessi _ satellite has nine coaxial germanium detectors , which record an x - ray emission from the full solar - disk in a wide energy range ( 3  kev17  mev ) with high temporal and energy resolutions as well as with a high signal sensitivity .",
    "the collected data are used for the restoration of images and spectra in the x - ray band , which is crucial for the investigations of non - thermal emission in solar fares .",
    "the images of the progenitor flare are reconstructed using the data collected with sub - collimators 2f , 3f , 4f , 5f , 6f , 8f , and 9f and integrated over 8 s periods with the use of the pixon imaging algorithm , and with 1 arcsec / pixel size @xcite .",
    "these images reveal sxr emission sources in soft ( 6 - 12 kev ) and intermediate ( 12 - 25 kev ) energy bands , co - spatial with the flare location .",
    "the images reconstructed in the energies above 25 kev show two footpoints and a loop - top source of a single flaring loop ( cf . , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , left panel ) .",
    "the superposition of the two hard x - ray emission sources , visible in the rhessi images restored in the 6 - 12 kev and 12 - 25 kev energy bands , suggests a loop - like structure of the flare .",
    "similar distribution of the emission is also seen in the images obtained with the _ soho_/eit telescope @xcite in a 195    band at 09:47:59 ut and 9:59:59 ut , after the impulsive phase of the flare ( cf . , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , right panel ) .",
    "the presence of the sub - resolution structures inside the observed main loop - like flaring structure is very likely , but due to limited spatial resolution of the available images , only the main geometrical properties of the visible main loop were estimated using a method proposed by @xcite .",
    "the cross - section of the loop , @xmath0 , is estimated as a mean of areas of both foot points delimited by a flux level equal to 30% of the maximum flux in the 25 - 50 kev energy range .",
    "the half - length of the loop , @xmath1 , is estimated from a distance between the centers of gravity of the footpoints , seen in the rhessi images taken in the 25 - 50 kev energy band , assuming a semi - circular shape of the loop .",
    "the volume of the loop then equals to @xmath2 .",
    "the geometric parameters of the loop are evaluated under the assumption that an observational error of the position of the observed structure is of the order of 1 pixel .",

    "_ goes-8 _ was equipped with two photometers , continuously recording the full - disk integrated x - ray emissions in two energy bands 1 - 8   and 0.5 - 4   with 3 s temporal resolution @xcite . the sxr ( 1 - 8  ) emission of the flare recorded by _",

    "band started to increase at the same time as the soft x - ray emissions , but peaked one minute earlier at 09:27:30 ut .",
    "a typical flaring loop is plausibly a 3d structure with a multi - thread internal structure , that is surrounded by a complex active region atmosphere and magnetic fields .",
    "currently there are no means of detecting and observing heating episodes and thermodynamic evolution of the individual threads .",
    "the observational limitations cause fundamental problems in numerical modelling of flaring loops , including selection of a relevant structure and number of threads as well as a proper model of spatial and temporal energy deposition .",
    "some crucial aspects of plasma dynamics in the flaring loops were already successfully modeled in a framework of various 1d hd models ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* and many others ) .",
    "however , as a result of inevitable simplifications imposed by the 1d models , an adequacy of these models as well as a precision of the presentation of various involved physical processes is limited . simplified 2d models , applying a continuous distribution of the physical parameters of the plasma across the loop and powered by a heating flux variable in time as well as along and across the loop ,",
    "would be recognised as an extreme borderline case of a multi - thread internal structure of the flaring loop with a filling factor equal to one .",
    "therefore such models might mimic to some extent the subtle structure and variations of the plasma parameters better than their 1d counterparts , revealing processes which are inherently absent in 1d models .",
    "however , the whole complexity in time and space of the processes occurring in the real multi - thread flaring loops is far beyond their scope .    in order to check general correctness and also to validate an applicability of such simplified multi - dimensional models , we investigate a broad set of models of the benchmark flare .",
    "this flare is simulated with the use of the modified nrl 1d hd code @xcite and of the 2d mhd flash code ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see subsection 3.2 for details ) with the aim of making a comparison between the results of the 1d and 2d models .      as a 1d numerical code",
    "we adopt the modified nrl code @xcite , in which we implement the new radiative losses and heating functions , with a mesh of the radiative loss rates calculated for the given range of temperatures ( @xmath8 - @xmath9 k ) and densities ( @xmath9 - @xmath10 @xmath11 ) with the use of the chianti code @xcite .",
    "the original nrl code is written for the isothermal chromosphere , which provides an insufficient amount of plasma available at the feet of the loop in the course of the massive chromospheric evaporation process .",
    "thus , energy fluxes consistent with the medium or large solar flares result in a massive evaporation of this isothermal chromosphere and in a non - physical downward motion of the feet even if the chromosphere was set unrealistically thick . in order to solve the problem , likewise in the 2d model ( cf .",
    ", section 3.2 ) , we implement the realistic temperature model c7 of the solar atmosphere @xcite , that is smoothly extended downwards by the bp04 model of the solar interior @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ figatm ] ) .",
    "this realistic model ensures a big enough storage of plasma within the loop .",
    "all other aspects of the adopted nrl model are unchanged , among others this code does not include viscosity and diffusion , but it takes into account radiative losses of the optically thin plasma , which can be switched off if necessary , and the whole plasma is assumed to be fully ionized .",
    "energy losses due to emission of the optically thick plasma are not taken into account , but @xcite have already shown that the energy losses due to emission of the flaring loop in the optically thick chromospheric lines range only from 3.5 to 15 percent of the total energy deposited to the flaring loop ( and even less during the impulsive phase solely ) .",
    "the modified code was thoroughly verified by comparison of the obtained results with those obtained with the original code @xcite .",
    "we developed a set of models , where in a framework of a particular model the energy deposition region has a limited length and volume and is located at a selected , fixed height .",
    "the diversity of the positions of the energy deposition volumes reflects various properties of the ntes beams , particularly various hardness of the ntes energy spectra .",
    "the actual position of the energy deposition volume along the loop in the 2d models ( cf .",
    ", section 3.2 ) is selected in the vicinity of the position of the energy deposition region that was estimated with the use of the 1d hd model of the flare @xcite . in case of 2d models , we applied gaussian distributions of energy deposition in both horizontal and vertical directions . in the horizontal direction",
    "a gaussian distribution of energy deposition is qualitatively similar to the observed spatial distribution of the hxr emission at the feet in real flaring loops .",
    "usually the hxr emission is highest in the centres of these emission sources and decreases toward the edges of the same sources , but an exact distribution of the emission is event - dependent . in the vertical direction",
    "a gaussian distribution of energy deposition rates was adopted both in 1d and 2d models as a simplest model of an effective distribution of the ntes precipitation depths .",
    "the implemented temporal evolution of a delivered energy flux mimics typical variations of energy fluxes observed in solar flares , with gradual growth , and impulsive and gradual decay phases .",
    "such simplification is acceptable as we do not aim to build an exact model of any specific solar flare , but instead our goal is to compare 1d and 2d models of plasma dynamics and evolution of a flaring loop .",
    "guided by this purpose we construct an initial , quasi - stationary pre - flare model of the flaring loop , using basic geometrical and thermodynamic parameters estimated from _",
    "rhessi _ and _ goes _ data : half - length , cross - section , initial pressure at the base of the transition region , temperature , emission measure , mean electron density , and _ goes_-class ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the initial pressure at the base is set in order to obtain a static plasma having a temperature at the top of the loop that is close to the observed one .",
    "the models are calculated for the periods lasting from the very beginning of the impulsive phase to far beyond the maximum of the soft x - ray emissions , lasting usually for about 300 s.      two - dimensional numerical models of the solar flare are calculated using the flash code @xcite . in this code",
    "a third - order unsplit godunov and riemann solvers , various slope limiters , and an adaptive mesh refinement are implemented .",

    "we impose boundary conditions by fixing in time all plasma quantities at all four boundary layers to their equilibrium values .",
    "the only exception is the bottom boundary , where we replace the equilibrium plasma quantities by implementing plasma heating which was modelled by gas pressure variations defined as : @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the relative amplitude of the pressure signals , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the horizontal positions of these two signals , @xmath23 is their vertical position , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the horizontal and vertical widths of the signals .",

    "for instance , in the present flaring loop system , where the plasma pressure is perturbed by flare energy release , the evolution of slow magnetoacustic waves is likely along the magnetic field lines , and the presence of thermal conduction and viscosity results in their dissipation @xcite leading to the plasma heating . under suitable conditions ,",
    "some of these waves may steepen in the form of shocks , which propagate along the magnetic field lines ( cf .",
    "therefore , in conclusion , slow magnetoacoustic waves may dissipate and heat the plasma .",
    "numerous previous hydrodynamic simulations of flaring loops failed to reproduce high temperatures and mass densities typical for gradual phase of the solar flares .",
    "in particular , during the gradual phase of the flare a much slower decay of the sxr flux is usually observed than could be expected from analytical estimation of energy losses of the flaring plasma by radiation and by conduction @xcite or from hd numerical modelling of the flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , proving that during this phase of the flares significant heating is also present .",
    "similar conclusions were already drawn by @xcite and @xcite . in order to solve this problem , @xcite applied multi - thread , time - dependent 1d hydrodynamic simulations of solar flares as a multitude of tiny , parallel loops for investigations of the so - called masuda flare which took place on january 13 , 1992 .",
    "he showed that modelling a flare as a sequence of independently heated threads instead of as a single loop may resolve the discrepancies between the simulations and observations , but by cost of some ad - hoc parameters ( number of loops , energy share by particular loops etc . ) .",
    "additionally , @xcite and @xcite showed that energy delivered by non - thermal electrons was fully sufficient to fulfill the energy budgets of the plasma during the pre - heating and impulsive phases of analyzed flares as well as during the decay phase .",
    "they concluded that in the case of the investigated flares there was no need to use any additional heating mechanisms other than heating by ntes .",
    "these two results allows one to model a flaring loop as a macroscopic loop having a multi - thread internal structure and heated by a variable in time energy flux transported to the feet of the loop by ntes only .",
    "however , the multi - thread internal structure of the flaring loop is poorly resolved by contemporary instruments , and there are no means to investigate individual heating episodes and thermodynamic evolution of the individual threads . these observational limitations cause fundamental problems in numerical modelling of multi - thread flaring loops , including a proper selection of a relevant structure and number of treads , _ i.e. _ filling - factor of the observed macroscopic loop , as well as a proper model of spatial and temporal energy deposition in the threads .    in this work we analyzed thoroughly a broad set of 1d hd and 2d mhd models of a solar flare , derived in order to compare and understand the energy transfer , plasma redistribution , and physical conditions of the various models of the flaring loops .",
    "initial physical and geometrical parameters of the flaring loop , applied as a working model of the typical solar flare , are set according to the observations of a m1.8-flare recorded in the ar10126 active region on september 20 , 2002 between 09:21 ut and 09:50 ut . the modeled loop was embedded into the realistic temperature model of the solar atmosphere , smoothly extended downward below the photosphere .",
    "the non - ideal 1d models include thermal conduction and radiative losses of the optically thin plasma as energy loss mechanisms , while the non - ideal 2d models includes viscosity and thermal conduction as energy loss mechanism only .",
    "the global evolution of the main physical properties and associated parameters of the plasma confined in the flaring loops occurred in the same way in all the models .",
    "the thorough comparison of the main physical characteristics of the 1d hd and 2d mhd models of the flare shows that the basic properties of the flaring plasma are acceptably well reproduced using both models , ensuring that results obtained already using a simplified 1d approach remain valuable for understanding the chief physical properties of the solar flares .",
    "the imhd models , often applied in modelling of the solar flares , apply very simplified approximation of the real processes occurring during the flares as well as of local and macroscopic properties of flaring plasma , if compared with much more realistic vdc models .",
    "some non - realistic properties of plasma modelled in the imhd models are thus the direct effect of basic assumptions and limitation of the imhd methodology .",
    "however , imhd models can be applied , with great success , for investigations of some problems , such as interactions of the waves in the loops having a non - stiff magnetic field or plasma - waves interactions .",
    "we show that simplified 2d models , having a continuous distribution of the physical parameters of the plasma across the loop and powered by a heating flux variable in time as well as along and across the loop , are an extreme borderline case of a multi - thread internal structure of the flaring loop with a filling factor equal to one",
    ". therefore such models might mimic to some extent the subtle structure and variations of the plasma parameters better than their 1d counterparts , revealing processes which are inherently absent in 1d models .",
    "however , the whole complexity in time and space of the processes occurring in the real multi - thread flaring loops is far beyond their scope .    in our approach",
    "used in the present work the 2d energy deposition region located inside the limited volume of the magnetic field automatically defines a multi - thread loop ( or multi - thread arcade ) in a pre - existing magnetic field , filled in various ways by evaporating plasma . in this approach ,",
    "the only parameters to be selected / determined are the size of heating area ( and spatial distribution of the energy flux in a frame of the source , if necessary ) as well as the amount of delivered energy .",
