    "while the numerical approximation of ordinary differential equations has a long history , the systematic study of how to compute time invariant structures began in the 1980s .",
    "rigorous computations of these structures is an even more recent phenomenon ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these latter efforts can be roughly divided into two approaches : direct computation of invariant sets , e.g. , periodic orbits , heteroclinic and homoclinic orbits , invariant manifolds , and a more indirect approach based on identification of isolating neighborhoods .",
    "the advantages of the direct approach are clear : it leads to efficient algorithms and provides precise numerical bounds on solutions .",
    "the disadvantage is that , in general , it does not provide information about the global structure of the dynamics and the results are sensitive to changes in parameters .",
    "as indicated below , the indirect approach overcomes these disadvantages , however , the construction of appropriate methods of approximation has proven to be a significant challenge .    for the sake of simplicity",
    "consider a smooth ordinary differential equation @xmath0 that generates a flow @xmath1 .",
    "the focus of this paper is on obtaining a finite representation of @xmath2 from which information concerning the structure of the dynamics can be obtained .",
    "a theoretical resolution to this challenge is as follows .",
    "recall that given @xmath3 the _ maximal invariant set _ in @xmath4 under the flow @xmath5 is @xmath6 a compact set @xmath3 is an _ isolating neighborhood _ under @xmath2 if @xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath8 is called an _ isolated invariant set_. the conley index ( see section  [ sec : conleyindex ] ) is an algebraic topological invariant that provides information about the existence and structure of isolated invariant sets .    to perform computations ,",
    "we make use of a discretization in time . choose @xmath9 and define the diffeomorphism @xmath10 by @xmath11 in analogy with the setting of flows , the maximal invariant set in @xmath4 under @xmath12 is defined by @xmath13 from which one can define isolating neighborhoods and isolated invariant sets .    a fundamental result ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) guarantees that @xmath14 is an isolated invariant set for @xmath2 if and only if @xmath15 is an isolated invariant set for @xmath12 , independent of the choice of @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) the conley index of @xmath15 computed using @xmath12 determines the conley index for @xmath15 under @xmath2 . thus from a mathematical perspective no information is lost by studying the map @xmath12 as opposed to the flow @xmath2 .    to obtain a representation of @xmath12 with which we can compute , we discretize the phase space . for the sake of simplicity of presentation",
    ", we assume that we are interested in understanding the global dynamics of @xmath2 or equivalently @xmath12 restricted to a rectangular isolating neighborhood @xmath16 .",
    "this allows us to discretize @xmath17 using a cubical grid @xmath18 ( see section  [ sec : numerics ] ) with diameter less than some given @xmath19 .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath12 can be encoded using a multivalued map @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 where @xmath22 .    making use of the fact that @xmath23 can be interpreted as a directed graph ,",
    "a wide variety of efficient algorithms have been developed for finding isolating neighborhoods and morse decompositions for @xmath12 ( see  @xcite,@xcite ) and for computing the associated conley indices @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by choosing finer grids , i.e. , letting @xmath24 and making better approximations , i.e. , letting @xmath25 , one can recover any isolated invariant set @xcite .",
    "more generally , one can find all attractor - repeller pairs or equivalently all morse decompositions and in the limit recover conley s fundamental decomposition theorem @xcite .",
    "thus , from a theoretical perspective this approach allows us to recover the local and global dynamics associated with isolated invariant sets generated by ordinary differential equations .",
    "however , in concrete applications there are significant technical obstructions .",
    "observe that there are three explicit parameters in the above mentioned approach : the time step @xmath26 , the grid size @xmath27 , and the accuracy of the approximation of the dynamics @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics that can be extracted is quite sensitive to the particular choices of these parameters .",
    "for example , for a fixed @xmath27 , if @xmath26 is too small then @xmath29 for every @xmath30 and every @xmath31 . in this case",
    "no isolating neighborhood can be extracted and hence there is no interesting dynamics that can be resolved .",
    "notice that the number of grid elements increases rapidly as an inverse function of @xmath27 and thus it becomes computationally prohibitive to choose @xmath27 too small .",
    "observe that if @xmath32 for all @xmath33 , then it is reasonable to assume that for a sufficiently large @xmath26 , @xmath34 , at which point one may hope to be able to start extracting interesting dynamical features .",
    "clearly , the size of the parameter @xmath26 depends on @xmath35 , the magnitude of the vector field .",
    "the naive conclusion is that @xmath26 should be chosen to be large .",
    "however , this leads to other difficulties . we need to evaluate @xmath12 which in practice requires us to integrate the differential equation over time @xmath26 .",
    "simple gronwall inequalities imply that , in general , the numerical bounds on errors associated with this integration will grow exponentially in @xmath26 . suggesting that large @xmath26 leads to exponentially large @xmath28 , which in turn leads to large images of @xmath23 .",
    "larger images of @xmath23 imply that less information related to the dynamics of @xmath2 can be extracted .",
    "to address these issues , in this paper we consider a more general approach to encoding the dynamics .",
    "let @xmath36 be a continuous function and consider the map @xmath37 defined by @xmath38 in principle this allows us to vary the integration time over the phase space , which allows us to compensate for the varying magnitude of the vector field and sensitivity of propagation of numerical errors .",
    "a brief outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : numerics ] presents numerical examples that contrast results using fixed time steps @xmath12 and spatially varying time steps @xmath39 .",
    "the goal is not to provide new results concerning the dynamics of a particular ordinary differential equation , but rather to demonstrate the potential usefulness of this approach .",
