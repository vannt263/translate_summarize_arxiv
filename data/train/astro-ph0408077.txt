    "understanding how galaxies formed and evolved is a central challenge of modern astronomy . in the past decade ,",
    "spectacular progress in instrumentation and observing techniques has enabled major advances as the high - redshift universe has been opened up for research .",
    "our current view has been largely influenced by the discovery of an abundant population of actively star - forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath29 selected by the efficient lyman - break technique @xcite .",
    "these lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) are among the best - studied classes of high - redshift objects : large samples have been spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath29 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and extensive investigations have focussed notably on their stellar populations , star formation histories , chemical abundances , kinematics , and clustering properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "lbgs dominate the ultraviolet ( uv ) luminosity density at high redshift and their number density is comparable to that of @xmath30 galaxies locally , making them a major constituent of the early universe . in the context of the widely favoured hierarchical scenarios of galaxy formation ,",
    "they are thought to be the progenitors of present - day massive galaxies in groups and clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "yet , by construction the lyman - break technique relies on a strong lyman discontinuity in the rest - frame far - uv and is necessarily biased towards relatively unobscured galaxies with intense recent or on - going star formation activity .",
    "the typical stellar ages derived for lbgs are of a few @xmath31 with moderate extinction @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "older and more quiescent systems at @xmath33 that have formed the bulk of their stars at @xmath34 or , alternatively , more obscured galaxies may have escaped detection in optical surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . with the advent of @xmath35-class telescopes and the development of sensitive near - infrared ( nir ) instruments equipped with large - format detectors ,",
    "it has become possible to extend very deep surveys to longer wavelengths and access the rest - frame optical emission of sources at @xmath36 . compared to the rest - frame uv ,",
    "the rest - frame optical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies is less affected by the light of young massive stars and by dust extinction , and better traces longer - lived stars that dominate the stellar mass .",
    "colour criteria involving nir bandpasses can now be applied to identify new populations at @xmath37 .",
    "the long - standing debate over the formation of massive early - type galaxies has driven considerable interest in the discovery of , and subsequent systematic searches for , red objects such as the `` extremely red objects '' ( eros ) generally defined by @xmath38 or @xmath39 . in our own faint infrared extragalactic survey ( fires ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , based on very deep nir imaging of the hubble deep field south ( hdf - s ) and of the field around the @xmath5 cluster @xmath4 , we have identified significant numbers of fairly bright ( @xmath40 ) candidate @xmath1 galaxies selected from their @xmath0 colours .",
    "analysis of the hdf - s sample suggests that this population makes a comparable contribution to the stellar mass density at @xmath33 as lbgs @xcite and hence may be a substantial component in terms of stellar mass . remarkably , there are far fewer such bright red objects per unit area in the hdf - north ( e.g. @xcite ; see also @xcite )",

    "however , the focus has been on those objects with the most extreme colours , which are rarer and mostly at the faintest magnitudes .",
    "an immediate question is what causes the red colours of these objects .",
    "very red nir colours can be produced by an evolved population at @xmath41 due to the stellar photospheric balmer/4000  break redshifted into the @xmath42 band and beyond or by high levels of extinction in galaxies possibly at lower redshifts .",
    "the presence of a highly obscured active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is another possibility ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", it also shows that the spectroscopic sample does not probe the entire range of properties seen for the ensemble of drgs .",
    "the wavelength sampling and resolution of our data are too coarse to delineate accurately a balmer/4000  break .",
    "even when strongest , the break represents a moderate flux jump by a factor of @xmath140 , a subtle feature compared to the lyman break at 912   . for the brightest drg of the spectroscopic sample ,",
    "the presence of a break is confirmed by the detection of a significant drop in continuum level in its nir spectrum collected with nirspec at the keck telescope @xcite .",
    "here , we examine the observed nir properties of our ensemble of drgs using diagnostic colour - colour diagrams , which allow us to establish that a break is required to explain the colours of an important fraction of them .    specifically , we test whether the red observed nir colours of drgs ( 1 ) can be reconciled with a very young ( @xmath141 ) stellar population that is highly obscured by dust , or if ( 2 ) the presence of a more evolved ( @xmath142 ) stellar population whose sed has a prominent balmer/4000break is necessary . in exploring various colour combinations , we relied on the sharpness of the balmer/4000  break versus the smoother wavelength dependence of dust attenuation .",
    "extinction makes all colours redder while a prominent break produces a larger contrast between colours because of the steep drop in flux at the break . as a stellar population ages , the continuum slope intrinsically reddens",
    "because cooler stars dominate the optical light but the break remains comparatively sharp . for redshifted populations",
    ", these differences in colour contrast will be reflected in the variations with @xmath143 in colour - colour space .",
    "we found that @xmath15 versus @xmath14 and @xmath14 versus @xmath13 provide the most sensitive diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the use of these adjacent bandpasses traces as closely as possible the balmer/4000  break in the range @xmath144 while minimizing reddening due to dust and to cool dominant stars .",
    "figure  [ fig - nircol ] compares in these diagrams the colour distributions of the drgs with the redshift evolution at @xmath145 of selected model seds : 250  myr and 1  gyr old single - age stellar populations ( ssps ) , a passively evolving population formed at @xmath146 , and populations with constant star formation rate ( csf ) and ages of 10  myr , 100  myr , and 1  gyr .",
    "we computed the synthetic spectra and colours using the codes of @xcite and @xcite as for the sed modeling and with the same standard assumptions ( see   [ sect - models ] ) .",
    "we also plot tracks for the 100  myr old csf model with @xmath139 in the range @xmath147 , applying the extinction law of @xcite and a uniform foreground screen geometry .",
    "the model tracks in the top panels of figure  [ fig - nircol ] show the expected trend that the older the age , the larger the amplitude of the colour variations with @xmath143 as the stronger break moves redwards across the successive bandpasses .",
    "the effect is maximized for ssps or passively evolving populations , where the break is not diluted by the light from younger stars with shallower or no absorption features and with bluer continuum .",
    "csf models are consistently bluer in all colours and occupy narrower regions than ssps of the same age .",
    "extinction effects shift the tracks along paths that run diagonally across the diagrams but preserve their amplitude at fixed age . as shown schematically in the bottom panels , the locus of csf models with varying extinction gets wider with older ages , because of the stronger break .",
    "the effects of aging and extinction can be distinguished in that the loci of dusty model tracks broaden with increasing age in the direction perpendicular to the extinction path , the key feature we here exploit .",
    "the immediate result from these diagrams is that the colours of the ensemble of drgs can not be reconciled with very young and highly obscured populations .",
    "dusty csf models need the broadening due to significant aging to better match the observed spread perpendicular to the extinction vector .",
    "to quantify the fraction of drgs not overlapping with the dusty models , figure  [ fig - nircol_proj ] presents histograms where the colour distributions have been rebinned as a function of the deviation in @xmath14 and @xmath13 around the line best representing the dusty 100  myr old csf tracks ( using robust linear regression ) .",
    "the maximum extent of the tracks about this line is indicated in the plots .",
    "the central loci and maximum widths for the 10  myr and 1  gyr old dusty csf models are plotted as well . about two - thirds of the drg sample has colours which are inconsistent with those of a 10  myr old obscured star - forming population .",
    "the fraction drops to @xmath148 for an age of 100  myr , and @xmath149 for 1  gyr ( depending on the colour considered ) .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath15 versus @xmath14 diagram shows that if drgs are actively star - forming , then the @xmath0 colour cut will miss even those with a strong optical break unless they are highly obscured .",
    "in other words , the criterion preferentially selects not only for the most evolved star - forming systems but for the most obscured ones as well .",
    "the need for high extinction is alleviated for scenarios where the star formation rate is declining with time ( as we discuss further in   [ sect - models ] ) , but the @xmath28 colour cut still selects for evolved galaxies .",
    "figures  [ fig - nircol ] and [ fig - nircol_proj ] demonstrate that the red nir colours of the ensemble of drgs can not be attributed to extinction effects alone . for a significant fraction of the objects , the colours require the presence of a strong balmer/4000  break produced by stars with ages @xmath150 .",

    "similar results were obtained in our initial study of hdf - s @xcite and for the spectroscopic sample @xcite . in particular , for the two spectroscopically - confirmed non - agn drgs in the @xmath4  field , the ages are supported by estimates from the h@xmath131 equivalent widths and the stellar masses are consistent with the dynamical masses from the h@xmath131 or [ ] @xmath217    line widths . as we show in   [ sub - paramvar ] , the stellar masses are the most robust properties against variations in sfh , metallicity , and extinction law ( neglecting changes in the imf ) . with our definition ,",

    "this may be due to worse template mismatch at @xmath234 .",

    "the maximum age constraint limits the relative contribution of evolved versus young stars to the integrated light , further enhancing the need for extinction . over the range of sfhs explored here ,",

    "the best - fit @xmath139 s also remain the same or decrease , by at most 0.6  mag .",
    "the effects are more important for the @xmath243 and smc law models , with generally older ages by up to a factor of 5 and @xmath139 s lower by up to 2  mag . in both model sets ,",
    "the instantaneous sfrs are strongly affected towards shorter timescales @xmath230 , especially for the low - metallicity case .",
    "the stellar masses are systematically lower for both variants , by a factor of @xmath140 on average .",
    "the near - systematic increase in median age of the drgs for the lower metallicity models can be attributed to the combined effects from the extinction law and stellar emission .",
    "since the smc law is steeper in the rest - frame uv than both the @xcite and mw laws , lower @xmath139 values will reproduce the observed sed slopes in this regime but also imply bluer rest - frame uv - to - optical colours such that older ages are required to match the colours of drgs .",
    "in addition , at @xmath247 and for a fixed age , the stellar evolutionary tracks and model atmospheres predict higher effective temperatures , bluer continua , and shallower metallic and molecular absorption features , further driving up the best - fit model ages . as emphasized by @xcite ,",
    "it is important here to keep in mind that theoretical stellar tracks and stellar atmosphere models for non - solar metallicities are still not fully tested against empirical data ( see the discussion by * ? ? ?",
    "the variations in derived parameters we describe above provide nevertheless indications of the magnitude of metallicity effects .",
    "we further note that the high obscuration inferred for the models with star formation timescales @xmath248 raises concerns about the applicability to drgs of the adopted @xcite extinction law and foreground dust screen geometry .",
    "the @xcite law provides a good representation for local uv - bright starbursts with @xmath139 up to about 2.5  mag and where the foreground dust approximation is observationally supported . for the csf model , for instance ,",
    "the @xmath139 values obtained for half of the drgs indicate extinction levels at the limit of , or beyond the range of validity .",
    "this may suggest that the @xcite law is inappropriate , and that the dust and sources geometry is more complex .",
    "the picture that emerges from our sed analysis and modeling is that drgs constitute an old and massive galaxy population at high - redshift .",
    "obscuration by interstellar dust plays an important role in their observed properties . depending on their actual sfh",
    ", they may also still be very actively forming stars . in this section",
    ", we interpret our results in a broader context by comparing our drgs with lbgs .",
    "we also consider the ensemble of all @xmath27-band selected galaxies in both fires fields at @xmath9 .",
    "we modeled these samples in the exact same way as the drgs .",
    "an immediate implication of the model results presented in   [ sect - models ] is that drgs appear to be older , more obscured , and with higher stellar masses than lbgs .",
    "our sample of optically - selected lbgs at @xmath87 and @xmath9 in hdf - s allows a consistent comparison , based on the same data and with identical model ingredients and assumptions . with our standard csf model ,",
    "we derive median values for the lbgs of @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 . with the @xmath163  model ,",
    "we find lower median age of 360  myr and sfr of @xmath254 , but the same median extinction , stellar mass , and m / l ratio . we can not statistically discriminate between the fits for different sfhs for any of our lbgs .    compared to the hdf - s lbgs and with csf , our drgs are typically @xmath255 times older , @xmath256 times more obscured , have roughly an order of magnitude higher stellar mass , and form stars at @xmath257 times higher instantaneous rates ( based on the median properties ) . among the various declining sfhs we considered , the @xmath163  model leads to the lowest extinction for the drgs ( figure  [ fig - paramvar ] ) .",
    "one might expect that this sfh reduces most the inferred differences between the two populations .",
    "the drgs , however , remain distinct from lbgs in their median properties except for the sfr , being 3 times older , 1.5 times more extincted , @xmath258 times more massive , and @xmath259 times as actively star - forming . as for the drgs ,",
    "the lbgs show an appreciable dispersion in best - fit properties with some overlap with drgs .",
    "however , the differences in the median values and combinations thereof ( especially age , @xmath139 , and @xmath151 ) indicate that the ensemble properties of the two populations are different for either sfh .",
    "the distinction between the drgs and lbgs is best illustrated in figure  [ fig - mlv_av ] , which compares the distribution of the two populations in the @xmath260 plane ( where the median uncertainties from the 68% confidence intervals are @xmath261 in @xmath194 and @xmath204 in @xmath139 for the drg and lbg samples , and our two standard models ) .",
    "in this parameter space , the overlap is very small for the csf model .",
    "for the @xmath163  model , about two - thirds of the drgs shift to a lower extinction interval @xmath262 , in common with the lbgs , while the rest uniformly populates the higher @xmath139 range explored . the ensemble of drgs and lbgs",
    "remain however clearly separated in the ranges of @xmath236 ratios covered , with very little overlap .",
    "this is driven by the stellar masses since the drg and lbg samples are similarly luminous in the rest - frame @xmath26 band , with nearly identical median values of @xmath263 ( within 20% ) .",
    "the weakness of our hdf - s lbg sample is that @xmath66 s are available for seven out of 33 galaxies .",
    "however , we arrive at similar conclusions if we consider the model results for the spectroscopically confirmed lbg samples of @xcite and @xcite , also based on optical to nir seds .",
    "the typical ( median or geometric mean ) ages inferred are @xmath264 , with extinction @xmath32 and @xmath265 ( for @xmath246 , a salpeter imf down to 0.1@xmath16 , and our adopted cosmology ) .",
    "our results are within a factor of a few of those of @xcite and @xcite , similar to the difference between the latter two .",
    "it is however difficult to compare in detail the results among all three studies .",
    "the data sets are different in terms of depth , quality , and photometric bands involved .",
    "the sample of @xcite was selected in the hdf - n from the space - based hst data while the ground - based sample of @xcite was selected over a much wider area and is brighter . in their modeling , @xcite assumed exponentially declining sfhs with the timescale as a free parameter .",
    "@xcite did not attempt to fit the sfh and discuss mainly the csf scenario .",
    "in addition , the models of @xcite and @xcite relied on earlier versions of the bruzual & charlot code and partly different model ingredients . in view of this , it is probably fair to say that the properties derived for all three lbg samples are in broad agreement .",
    "the conclusions about the differences between drgs and lbgs remain qualitatively the same .",
    "we investigated relationships between the modeled quantities and the observed nir properties , the key feature of our drg selection .",
    "for this purpose , we complemented the drg samples with the hdf - s lbgs and all other @xmath27-band selected galaxies at @xmath9 in both the hdf - s and @xmath4  fields down to the same @xmath109 limits of 22.5 and 21.7  mag , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig - resall1 ] plots , for our standard @xmath163  model , the derived stellar masses and m / l ratios as a function of observed @xmath28 colour and @xmath27-band magnitude .",
    "the results with the csf are qualitatively similar .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the derived @xmath151 and the observed @xmath28 colour , which is even tighter for the @xmath266 ratio .",
    "the redder the objects , the higher the stellar masses and mass - to - light ratios .",
    "the drgs lie at the massive end and extend smoothly the relationships for the @xmath9 objects with bluer @xmath28 colours , including the lbgs . because of the different limiting magnitudes between the hdf - s and @xmath4fields , it is difficult to draw conclusions on the variations of @xmath151 and @xmath267 versus @xmath109 .",
    "the data suggest that our @xmath27-band selection does not miss a significant fraction of massive galaxies at @xmath9 that would be faint because of extinction effects .",
    "figure  [ fig - resall2 ] plots the variations of the derived extinctions and instantaneous star formation rates per unit stellar mass with observed @xmath28 colours .",
    "results for both the standard csf and @xmath163  models are shown .",
    "there are general trends of increasing @xmath139 and of decreasing @xmath268 with redder @xmath28 colour .",
    "the variations in derived ages ( not shown in figure  [ fig - resall2 ] ) are essentially the reverse of those in the @xmath268 ratio , which provides a measure of @xmath269 ( with a direct proportionality for the csf model , and a non - linear monotonic relation for the @xmath163  model ) .",
    "these plots further show that if drgs might be exceptional in their high absolute sfrs , they are not at all in terms of their sfr per unit mass .",
    "we here speculate about the evolution of the @xmath9 drgs in the fires fields , based on the results for the csf and @xmath163  models .",
    "figure  [ fig - cosmic_sfr ] plots the relative variations with redshift of the average sfr of the drg samples and , for comparison , of the hdf - s lbg sample at @xmath9 .",
    "we computed the curves from the model sfr @xmath270 used as input in the evolutionary synthesis . for each galaxy",
    ", we scaled the model @xmath270 curves to match the derived instantaneous sfr at the epoch of observation .",
    "for the purpose of this discussion , we in fact assumed that all galaxies lie at @xmath271 , close to the mean and median redshift of both our drg and lbg samples ( see   [ sect - sample ] ) .",
    "we then normalized the resulting average sfr curves to unity at @xmath271 .    for the csf model ,",
    "the average instantaneous sfr of the drg samples has not varied strongly since @xmath272 up to @xmath98 , increasing by a factor of @xmath140 with time . on the other hand ,",
    "the average instantaneous sfr of the hdf - s lbg sample has increased by more than an order of magnitude over the same redshift interval . for the @xmath163  model ,",
    "the variations are much noisier but indicate , broadly speaking , roughly comparable activity levels in the past out to @xmath273 , where the mean instantaneous sfr of lbgs drops abruptly .",
    "the relative variations in average sfr backwards in time are dominated by the age distribution among each population , and the steeper drop for the lbgs reflects their younger ages compared to the drgs .",
    "this extrapolation of the star formation histories suggests that @xmath9 drgs have started forming stars at very early epochs , and earlier than @xmath9 lbgs have .",
    "a possible scenario for drgs is that they are the evolved descendants of systems that experienced a `` lyman - break phase '' at @xmath34 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". this evolutionary picture may be consistent with the increased reddening in rest - frame uv - to - optical colours inferred by @xcite for lyman - break selected galaxies between @xmath274 ( `` @xmath55-dropouts '' ) and @xmath33 ( `` @xmath54-dropouts '' ) .",
    "we emphasize that the above discussion applies to the stellar populations that dominate the rest - frame uv - optical emission of the galaxies , as traced by the observed seds .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the stellar masses of drgs are already very high at @xmath275 and comparable to those of early - type galaxies locally .",
    "this may indicate that drgs have already assembled most of their stellar mass at these redshifts and evolve thereafter mostly passively . using our csf model results , we estimated the stellar masses predicted at @xmath276 if star formation is maintained at the same rate as inferred at the redshift of observation .",
    "the median present - day stellar masses would be @xmath277 , which correspond to the most massive galaxies in local galaxy clusters .",
    "while some of the drgs might evolve into such systems , it seems rather unlikely we have detected such large numbers of their progenitors in our two small fields .",
    "more plausibly , most of the drgs probably become predominantly quiescent systems at @xmath278 , and may possibly grow further in mass during brief merger events . assuming that drgs stop forming stars around their redshift of observation and evolve passively thereafter",
    ", the csf models predict colours of @xmath279 and @xmath280 at @xmath281 , even if all the dust is removed at the instant when star formation is quenched ( such red colours are also predicted using the @xmath163  models instead ) .",
    "this may suggest an evolutionary connection between drgs at @xmath1 and eros at @xmath282 .    in absolute terms ,",
    "the instantaneous sfrs of @xmath283 derived from the sed modeling assuming",
    "csf lie at the high end inferred for the local galaxy population , in the regime of luminous and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "such a high sfr rate seems supported by the possible detection of one of the non - agn spectroscopically - confirmed drg in the @xmath4  field at sub - millimeter wavelengths from deep scuba observations ( @xcite ; k. kraiberg knudsen et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "the csf hypothesis is unverifiable with the data at hand , and may be a valid representation for a few objects only .",
    "conversely , while the @xmath163  model implies substantially lower instantaneous sfr at the redshift of observation , the high stellar masses lead to extremely high sfrs at earlier epochs ( @xmath284 ) .",
    "obviously , the sfh of drgs may well be more complex than our simplistic assumptions .",
    "the less model - dependent estimate from @xmath215 of @xmath283 seems to suggest elevated levels of star formation activity averaged over the lifetime of the stellar populations traced by our seds .      using the results presented in this paper",
    ", we can crudely assess the relative importance of the drg and lbg populations at high redshift . in the following ,",
    "we consider our samples of drgs , lbgs , and @xmath27-band selected sources lying at @xmath9 and to the @xmath27 total magnitude limits of 22.5 for hdf - s and 21.7 for the @xmath4  field . in hdf - s ,",
    "the lbgs outnumber the drgs by a factor of three .",
    "they contribute about 2.5 times more than drgs to the total observed @xmath43-band light and extrinsic rest - frame @xmath26-band luminosity @xmath285 from all sources , with fractions of @xmath286 and @xmath287 , respectively .",
    "the relative contributions are reversed for the stellar mass , where drgs account for @xmath286 of the total compared to @xmath288 for lbgs ( using the individual @xmath151 s derived from either the csf or @xmath163models , and assuming the same model parameters for all populations ) . in the @xmath4  field and to the corresponding brighter magnitude limit , the drgs produce about 35% of the total observed @xmath27-band light and @xmath285 , and make up @xmath289 of the integrated @xmath151 .",
    "this provides a first - order indication that drgs may represent a significant constituent of the @xmath275 universe in terms of stellar mass .",
    "admittedly , our estimates are rough",
    ". a detailed analysis of the contribution of drgs to the stellar mass budget in both fires fields will be presented by g. rudnick et al .",
    "( in preparation ; see also @xcite for first estimates in hdf - s ) .",
    "we have presented the analysis and theoretical modeling of the @xmath12 seds of 34 drgs at @xmath9 .",
    "the galaxies were selected by their @xmath0 colours in the hdf - s and @xmath4  fields observed as part of the fires survey @xcite , at @xmath290 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "the addition of the @xmath4  field increases the area surveyed by a factor of five to an @xmath291 brighter limit and triples the original sample from hdf - s .",
    "this allows for the first time a robust assessment of the ensemble properties of drgs .",
    "we find large numbers of @xmath28 red objects in both fields , with surface densities of @xmath292 at @xmath293 .",
    "since no @xmath0 source is found in the hdf - n down to @xmath115 , cosmic variance is substantial .",
    "observations of wider areas and multiple lines of sight will be required for a more reliable determination of the surface density of the @xmath28 red population .    using new diagnostic diagrams involving the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 colours",
    ", we have shown that the red nir colours of the drgs can not be attributed to extinction effects alone and require the presence of a prominent balmer/4000  break characteristic of evolved stars for a large fraction of them . in the rest - frame",
    "optical , the seds of drgs fall within the envelope of normal nearby galaxies and , in the rest - frame uv , indicate a wide range in star formation activity and/or dust obscuration . the rest - frame",
    "uv - to - optical seds of drgs are in stark contrast with those of lbgs , which are much bluer and more uniform .",
    "these differences can be easily understood in terms of selection effects .",
    "the lbg criteria preferentially select galaxies that are actively star - forming and modestly obscured .",
    "our @xmath0 criterion primarily targets evolved systems , ranging from those with quiescent or no star formation and little extinction to those that are highly obscured and vigorously forming stars .",
    "we have applied evolutionary synthesis models to the seds of our drgs to constrain quantitatively the age of the stellar populations , the extinction , the stellar masses , and the star formation rates .",
    "we have also investigated the effects of variations in the assumed star formation history , metallicity , and extinction law on the model results .",

    ", we have explicitely shown that the distinction holds for constant star formation and @xmath163models , the two star formation histories that bracket the range of median @xmath139 s derived for our drgs ( neglecting variations in model parameters between the two classes ) .",
    "for both drgs and lbgs , there is a large spread in derived properties among individual objects and some of the drgs have ages , extinction , and stellar masses characteristic of lbgs , and vice - versa .",
    "however , the overlap is small , especially for the stellar masses and m / l ratios .",
    "comparison with the lbg studies of @xcite and @xcite is less straightforward because of differences in the optical / nir data sets , in the details of the sample selection , and in the modeling but , broadly speaking , it supports the same conclusions . more generally , we find that the derived age , extinction , and stellar mass all increase with redder @xmath28 colour among the full sample of @xmath9 @xmath27-band - selected galaxies in the fires fields , down to the same magnitude limits as the drg samples .",
    "the relationships are particularly well - defined for the stellar mass and m / l ratio versus @xmath28 colour .",
    "if drgs represent the most evolved and most massive galaxies at @xmath301 , it is tempting to speculate that they might be the precursors of the most massive present - day galaxies . such a final fate has been proposed for lbgs at @xmath33 in the context of hierarchical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for drgs , with stellar masses already similar to those of local early - type galaxies , one may reason in a simplistic way that there is little room for substantial growth through subsequent merger events .",
    "extrapolating the star formation histories backward in time for both drgs and lbgs at @xmath9 , we infer that the drg population has been forming stars at a roughly constant rate and possibly back to @xmath302 , whereas the lbgs started to form later at @xmath274 .",
    "this is consistent with a scenario in which the drgs are the evolved descendants of systems undergoing a `` lyman - break phase '' at @xmath303 .",
    "the drgs may evolve into the ero population at @xmath281 .",
    "another intriguing possibility is a connection with the high - redshift population detected at sub - millimeter wavelengths .",
    "one of the drgs in the @xmath4  field likely is the counterpart of a sub - millimeter source detected with scuba ( @xcite ; k. kraiberg knudsen et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "in addition , although detailed information is currently available for a few objects only , recent work indicates that some of the bright sub - millimeter galaxies at @xmath304 host evolved stellar populations , show evidence of substantial chemical enrichment , and have dynamical / stellar masses @xmath305 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the results presented here constitute a major improvement over our previous studies of @xmath28 selected objects at @xmath1 .",
    "significant uncertainties remain , however , and further investigations are clearly needed .",
    "our analysis still relies on a limited sample selected from two small fields and the model parameters are largely unconstrained .",
    "deep photometric surveys of wider areas and disjoint fields as well as extensive follow - up spectroscopy will be crucial to assess ( and average over ) field - to - field variations , secure the redshifts , derive robust number densities , and constrain more accurately the physical properties ( e.g. , extinction , metallicity , dynamical masses ) .",
    "the current dearth of constraints on the nature of drgs further limits our ability to interpret their observed properties . in that respect",
    ", it will be very important to establish firmly the frequency of agn among drgs and their contribution to the measured optical / nir seds , in particular from spectroscopy .",
    "it will also be important to obtain independent constraints on the current and past star formation rates , with observations at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths ( e.g. , with scuba and the spitzer space telescope ) complementing rest - frame optical line diagnostics .",

    "<S> we investigate the nature of the substantial population of high - redshift galaxies with @xmath0 colours recently discovered as part of our faint infrared extragalactic survey ( fires ) . </S>",
    "<S> this colour cut efficiently isolates galaxies at @xmath1 with red rest - frame optical colors ( `` distant red galaxies , '' or `` drgs '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> we select @xmath0 objects in both fires fields , the @xmath2 hubble deep field south ( hdf - s ) and the @xmath3 field around the @xmath4  cluster at @xmath5 ; the surface densities at @xmath6 are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we here discuss a sub - sample of 34 drgs at @xmath9 : 11 at @xmath10 in hdf - s and 23 at @xmath11 in the @xmath4  field . </S>",
    "<S> this sample enables for the first time a robust assessment of the population properties of drgs . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the @xmath12 spectral energy distributions ( seds ) constructed from our very deep near - infrared ( nir ) and optical imaging collected at the eso very large telescope and from the hubble space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we develop diagnostics involving the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 colours to argue that the red nir colours of our drg sample can not be attributed solely to interstellar dust extinction and require for many the presence of an evolved stellar population with a prominent balmer/4000  break . in the rest - frame , </S>",
    "<S> the optical colours of drgs fall within the envelope of normal nearby galaxies and the ultraviolet colours suggest a wide range in star formation activity and/or extinction . </S>",
    "<S> this is in stark contrast with the much bluer and more uniform seds of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) . from evolutionary synthesis modeling assuming constant star formation ( csf ) , we derive for the drgs old ages , large extinctions , and high stellar masses , mass - to - light ratios , and star formation rates . for solar metallicity , a salpeter imf between 0.1 and 100@xmath16 , and the calzetti et al . </S>",
    "<S> extinction law , the median values for the hdf - s ( @xmath4  field ) sample are 1.7 ( 2.0 )  gyr , @xmath17 ( 2.4 )  mag , @xmath18 ( 1.6 )  @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( 2.3 )  @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ( 170 )  @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> models assuming exponentially declining sfrs with @xmath24-folding timescales in the range @xmath25 generally imply younger ages , lower extinction , and lower sfrs , but similar stellar masses within a factor of two . compared to lbgs at similar redshifts and rest - frame @xmath26-band luminosities , </S>",
    "<S> drgs are older , more massive , and more obscured for any given star formation history . </S>",
    "<S> for the entire sample of @xmath27-band selected galaxies in the fires fields at @xmath9 and to the above magnitude limits , we find that the derived ages , extinctions , and stellar masses increase with redder @xmath28 colours . </S>",
    "<S> although the rest - frame optical colours of the drgs are similar to those of local normal galaxies , the derived properties are quite different ; detailed studies of this new @xmath1 population may significantly enhance our understanding of how massive galaxies assembled their stellar mass . </S>"
