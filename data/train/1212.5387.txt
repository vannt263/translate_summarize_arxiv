    "the force @xmath0 acting on a wire of length @xmath1 , constrained to be at rest in a magnetic flux density @xmath2 and carrying the electrical current @xmath3 orthogonal to @xmath2 , is derived by integrating the lorentz force on the conduction electrons , under the assumptions of current and field uniformity @xcite .",
    "similarly , the electric potential @xmath4 induced on a wire of length @xmath1 , moving at the velocity @xmath5 orthogonal to @xmath2 , is derived by assuming an uniform charge - carrier density .",
    "if the force @xmath6 counterbalances the weight @xmath7 of a mass @xmath8 in the gravitational field @xmath9 , by combining these equations and eliminating the geometric factor @xmath10 , we obtain the equation @xmath11 , which virtually relates mechanical and electrical powers and allows @xmath8 to be determined in terms of electrical quantities and , hence , of the planck constant .",
    "a number of subtleties have been dismissed in the previous analysis .",
    "firstly , the lorentz force acts on the free electrons , but the forces of constraint act on the ion lattice .",
    "the microscopic origin of the magnetic force has been investigated by many authors in order to resolve apparent inconsistencies @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that the hall field is the means whereby the force on the conduction electrons is transferred to the positively charged ions .",
    "this conclusion avoids misinterpretations , where a magnetic field does a work on the conductor .",
    "it has also been shown that the hall field leads to the magnetic force @xmath12 without violating the identity between the electrical and mechanical powers , once the joule power dissipated in the conductor has been taken into account .",
    "corrections to the ampere force - law were also proposed @xcite .    in the second place , the hall field  together with the electron- and ion - plasma stiffness  makes the electron and ion densities non - uniform and it induces charge layers close to the wire surfaces orthogonal to the hall field .",
    "consequently , the electrical - current density is not uniform .    in the third place , in a moving conductor , the lorentz force strains both the electron gas and the ions thus originating a compensating electric field .",
    "but , since the lorentz force is counteracted also by the electrons and ions elasticity , the induced electric potential is not as high as expected .",
    "these phenomena impose a reanalysis of the @xmath11 equation .",
    "therefore , we derived the magnetic force and the induced electric potential by using a magneto - hydrodynamical model proposed in @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the watt - balance coil is described by two overlapping compressible charged fluids , which are coupled to the external and self - induced electric and magnetic fields . in both the cases , a coil either carrying an electrical current or moving in the magnetic field , this model predicts non - uniform charge distributions that are the sources of electrical fields in a direction transverse to both the magnetic field and the charge motions .",
    "our study was prompted by the discrepancy between the planck constant values measured in different watt - balance experiments @xcite ; it is also a preliminary step to understand the physics of a proposed cryogenic version of the experiment @xcite .",
    "the watt - balance experiment virtually compares the mechanical and the electrical powers produced by the motion of a mass @xmath8 in the earth gravitational field and by the motion of the supporting coil in a magnetic field , respectively @xcite .",
    "the comparison is carried out in two steps .",
    "firstly , a balance is used to compare the weight @xmath13 with the force generated by the interaction between the electrical current @xmath3 flowing in the coil and the magnetic flux density @xmath14 .",
    "hence , by using the pseudo - cylindrical coordinate system defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : coord_system ] , this balance is expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the vertical direction , @xmath17 is the gravitational field , @xmath18 is the current density , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are pseudo - cylindrical coordinates along the coil wires , @xmath22 is the wire radius and @xmath1 is its length .    ) and ( [ dynamic:1 ] ) ; @xmath21 runs over the wire length , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are polar coordinates in the wire cross - section.,width=264 ]    in the second step , the coil is moved and the electric potential induced at the coil ends , @xmath23   \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau } } \\ , \\rmd \\tau   =   \\int_0^l \\boldsymbol{u}(r,\\varphi,\\tau ) \\cdot \\big [ \\boldsymbol{b}(r,\\varphi,\\tau ) \\times \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau } } \\big ]   \\ , \\rmd \\tau , \\ ] ] is measured .",
    "it must be noted that , provided the end surfaces @xmath24 and @xmath25 are equipotential , @xmath26 is independent of the integration path . therefore , we can set @xmath27 and evaluate ( [ dynamic:1 ] ) on the @xmath27 coil axis .",
    "if @xmath28 and @xmath14 are uniform and the coil velocity is the same everywhere and parallel to @xmath16 , that is , @xmath29 , ( [ static:1 ] ) and ( [ dynamic:1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath30 and @xmath31,respectively , where @xmath32 is a geometric factor . by eliminating it ,",
    "we obtain the measurement equation @xmath33 , which , virtually , balances mechanical and electrical powers . to derive this equation , current , magnetic field , and velocity must be assumed as rigorously uniform .",
    "these assumptions are also required to describe macroscopically the watt - balance operation by using the gradient of the magnetic flux linked to the coil .",
    "in fact , it must be considered that current and field inhomogeneities make , in principle , the fluxes linked in the static and dynamic coil - operation different .",
    "in order to estimate the hall field and charges distribution in the watt - balance coil , we model a metal as proposed by goedecke and kanim @xcite . hence , we consider two interpenetrating compressible and isothermal charged - fluids ",
