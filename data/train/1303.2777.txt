    "cppup has been one of the fastest and brightest novae ever recorded .",
    "it reached v@xmath0=0.2mag in nov 1942 and declined by several mag in less than 1 week ( @xmath1=6.5 days ) .",
    "after outburst it has not returned to the quiescent level it had before outburst , remaining about 5 mag brighter ( schaefer & collazzi 2010 ) .    the post outburst",
    "quiescent phase has been studied through time resolved broad band imaging and spectroscopy ( barrera & vogt 1989 , bianchini et al .",
    "1985 , 2012 , cropper 1986 , diaz & steiner 1991 , duerbeck et al .",
    "1987 , odonogue et al .",
    "1989 , patterson & warner 1998 , szkody & feinswog 1988 , warner 1985 , white et al . 1993 ) suggesting that cppup is a short orbital period cataclysmic variable ( cv ) .",
    "the spectroscopic period is shorter than the photometric period and both periods are unstable / variable .",
    "the wd mass derived from radial velocity studies has always been too small ( @xmath20.2 to @xmath20.6m@xmath3 ) to be consistent with classical nova theory and stellar evolution time scales .",
    "x - ray observations ( balman et al . 1995 , orio et al .",
    "2009 ) have always suggested a possible magnetic nature of the primary wd , though they could never firmly establish it .",
    "time resolved spectra were collected at the ctio 4 m telescope equipped with the rc - spectrograph on feb 6 and 7 2009 .",
    "the wavelength coverage was 3500-6000 with a resolution fwhm@xmath46 .",
    "the exposure times were 60s each with a duty cycle of less than 2min .",
    "the radial velocity measures of the h@xmath5 , h@xmath6 , heii@xmath74686 and ciii(1 ) , show a drift of the data points during the first night and possibly an offset from night to night ( fig.1 ) . from the fourier analysis of the whole data set we find two periods ( fig.2 ) : 1 ) the well known @xmath41.47hr period ( up to now interpreted as the orbital period of the binary ) , and 2 ) a longer period of @xmath410hr .",
    "this period is highly uncertain but possibly matches the true orbital period of the system .",

    "high resolution x - ray spectra were taken with chandra and the hetgs spectrograph .",
    "the wavelength coverage was 0.410kev at a resolution of e/@xmath8e@xmath41000 .",
    "seven exposures were collected between september 30 and october 31 2009 for a 175780s of total integration time .    our new chandra observations ",
    "though limited by a relatively low signal - to - noise ratio  show that the x - ray spectrum of cppup is modified by a complex , intrinsic absorber .",
    "while this is commonly seen in magnetic cvs , it has not been seen in non - magnetic cvs except at very high inclination angle ( i.e. , systems showing at least a grazing eclipse ; see mukai et al .",
    "this supports the magnetic cv interpretation . within this hypothesis and following mukai et al .",
    "( 2003 ) we fit the spectra using a cooling flow model .",
    "our best fit model temperature is kt=36.5kev with a 90% confidence range of 20.2-55.7kev .",
    "our best fit temperature corresponds to a wd mass of 0.8 ( 0.57-0.99 ) m@xmath3 .",
    "such a wd mass is in much better agreement with the current classical nova theory , though still on the low end of its expected value .",
    "our new optical and x - ray data suggest that cp pup is a magnetic cv , most likely of the intermediate polar ( ip ) type .",
    "in particular , the longer term modulation of the radial velocity curve suggests that cp pup is not a short orbital period system but a long period cv with orbital period p@xmath910hr .",
    "should this be confirmed , the spectroscopic period of @xmath41.47hr should be interpreted as the wd spin and its instability as an effect induced by the varying geometry of the emitting region ( i.e. the accretion curtain magnetic field lines that are continuously stretching , breaking and reconnecting ) .",
    "the slightly longer photometric period , instead , should be regarded as the beat between the spin and the orbital period .",
    "unfortunately , due to the range of values recorded for both the spectroscopic and photometric period and due to the lack of simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric observations , we could not constrain the putative long orbital period through simple beat frequency calculations .",
    "in addition , should cppup be a long orbital period ip , the observed x - ray modulation ( orio et al .",
    "2009 , balman et al .",
    "1995 ) would arise from the accreting magnetic pole(s ) and match the wd spin period ; the nir light curve ( szkody & feinswog 1988 ) should be interpreted similarly to dqher ( chanan & nelson 1978 ) , and the calculation of the dynamical masses would certainly deliver more reasonable values , possibly consistent with those determined from the x - ray observations .",
    "however , as the longer period is poorly sampled and highly uncertain , it remains necessary to observe cppup again , in time resolved spectroscopy and over at least four consecutive nights , thus to securely pin down the long period existence and its exact value ."
