    "the fact that certain spin systems can be used for transferring quantum states from a ` source ' to a ` destination ' spin have been recently observed and studied by a number of authors ( see @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown that a perfect transfer of an arbitrary qubit is possible in spin chains @xcite@xcite and some other cases @xcite@xcite . as observed by bose et al .",
    "@xcite , such a system can also be used for creating an entanglement between the source and destination spins . in this note",
    "we develop ideas presented in @xcite and prove that one can get a high fidelity transfer between two spins weakly coupled to an arbitrary connected network provided only that they are placed in a local magnetic field we can control .",
    "we also propose a generalization of this scheme and show that a spin network can be used for communication with many destination spins , if a source spin tunes his local magnetic field to the frequency of an appropriate receiver .",
    "the structure of the note goes as follows .",
    "first we describe a model of weakly coupled spins ( wcs ) and compute the effective hamiltonian of such systems .",
    "then we use our approach to study communication between spins coupled to a spin chain , a cycle , and , finally , to an arbitrary spin network . in the next section of the paper",
    "we introduce a multi - wcs communication protocol . in this model a source spin",
    "selects an appropriate ` communication frequency ' using which it can effectively communicate with another user of the network .",
    "finally , we use this scheme to create entangled states between network users .",
    "in particular , we discuss how to get an almost perfect bell state for two spins and generalized @xmath0 states in the case of several network users .",
    "let us consider two spins coupled to a network @xmath1 of @xmath2 spins .",
    "we write the hamiltonian of a network @xmath1 as @xmath3 where we sum over all network edges @xmath4 . a ` source ' spin @xmath5",
    "is coupled to a spin @xmath6 from @xmath1 , and a ` destination ' spin @xmath7 is coupled to a @xmath8 from @xmath1 .",
    "the strength of these couplings we denote by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , respectively , where we assume that @xmath11 are constants independent of @xmath2 but @xmath12 decreases with @xmath2 . moreover , spins @xmath5 and @xmath7 are placed in local magnetic fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "then , the hamiltonian of the whole system can be written as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 given above while @xmath17 note that @xmath18 conserves the total number of excitations",
    ". we shall be mostly interested in the case when there is only one excitation in the system .",
    "then , the system remains in the hilbert space spanned by vectors @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the position of the excitation and takes values either @xmath21 , or @xmath22 .",
    "observe that the hamiltonian written in this basis is similar to the network adjacency matrix .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be the sets of the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of @xmath16 , respectively",
    ". then @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27    now , let us consider two cases . in the ` resonant ' case we have @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is one of the non - degenerated eigenvalues of @xmath1 .",
    "then all terms of the hamiltonian @xmath18 corresponding to @xmath30 are of the lower order , and the evolution of the system takes place essentially in the space @xmath31 spanned by vectors @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the projection of the hamiltonian onto @xmath31 in the basis @xmath35 can be written as @xmath36    in order to obtain an effective hamiltonian for the ` non - resonant ' case , where @xmath37 and @xmath37 for all @xmath38 , i.e. , when the local magnetic fields of the source and the destination spins are not ` tuned ' to any ` natural frequency ' of the network , we follow the approach presented in @xcite . define a hermitian operator @xmath39 as @xmath40 and set @xmath41 .",
    "note that @xmath42 then , expanding @xmath43 and @xmath44 into power series , we get @xmath45+i[s , v]+\\frac{i^2}{2!}[s,[s , h_0]]+\\dots.\\ ] ] let us choose @xmath46 and @xmath47 so that the terms of the first order in @xmath12 vanish , i.e. , @xmath48=0.\\ ] ] for such a condition the hamiltonian @xmath49 becomes @xmath50+\\frac{i^2}{2!}[s,[s , h_0]]+o({\\varepsilon}^3).\\ ] ] thus , the projection of @xmath51 onto the space generated by @xmath52 can be written @xmath53    using the above formulae for @xmath54 and @xmath55 it is not hard to find sufficient conditions under which the state transfer from @xmath5 to @xmath7 occurs . in the resonant case , one ought to choose all the off - diagonal case to be of the same absolute value @xmath56 .",
    "then , the time of the transfer is , roughly , @xmath57 . for the non - resonant case , in order to have a nearly perfect transfer between @xmath5 and @xmath7 , one should make all the diagonal terms of @xmath58 equal , and ensure that the off - diagonal terms do not vanish .",
    "moreover , if the absolute value of the off - diagonal term is @xmath59 , then the transfer occurs in time @xmath60 .",
    "finally , we remark that if we apply the same approach to the case when both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are close to a degenerated eigenvalue , we obtain an effective hamiltonian whose projection @xmath63 is greater than @xmath64 .",
    "thus , typically , no selection of @xmath65 and @xmath66 can reduce @xmath63 to a form which guarantees a perfect transfer . thus , in general",
    ", we can not hope to get a perfect transfer by tuning to a degenerate eigenvalue of @xmath16 .",
    "in the paper @xcite we considered a wcs model for spin chains consisting of @xmath2 spins , where the source and the destination spins @xmath5 , @xmath7 , were coupled to the ends of the chain , and @xmath67 .",
    "we showed that such a system admit a high - fidelity transfer of quantum states but the precise description of this phenomenon depends heavily on the parity of @xmath2 .",
    "the reason for that is clear when we compute the effective hamiltonian for such a system : the case of even @xmath2 is non - resonant , while for @xmath2 odd , when zero is an eigenvalue of the chain , a resonant transmission occurs .",
    "now let us consider more general case in which @xmath5 and @xmath7 are coupled to arbitrary spins of the chain .",
    "the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the chain are given by @xmath68 respectively , where @xmath2 is the chain length and @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath7 are coupled to the @xmath6th and @xmath8th spin in the chain , respectively , then @xmath70 for @xmath71 .    in the `",
    "symmetric case ' , in which @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 and , as long as @xmath75 , both the resonant and non - resonant cases give perfect transfer with transfer times of the orders @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the asymmetric case , when @xmath78 needs a bit more attention . if we put @xmath79 , then @xmath80 and the transfer occurs with probability bounded from above by a constant smaller than one .",
    "however , the transfer can be made perfect by switching to a resonant case . in order to do",
    "that one needs to select the coupling constants @xmath65 and @xmath66 in such a way that @xmath81 , so the condition for a perfect transfer is satisfied ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) .",
    "another example of communicating through a simple spin network is to attach two spins to @xmath2-cycle .",
    "the eigenvectors and eigenvalues for an @xmath2-cycle are @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively . for a ` resonant communication ' through @xmath2-cycle we have only either one or two possible non - degenerated eigenvectors to choose from , namely @xmath84 for an odd @xmath2 , and @xmath85 and @xmath84 for an even @xmath2 . moreover",
    ", one can check that in this case coupling to a degenerated eigenvector can not lead to a resonant transfer which is nearly perfect .",
    "this observation is analogous to a result of christandl _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which states that the perfect transfer in the chain with equal couplings is possible only for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "finally , let us consider a general network @xmath1 with the source spin @xmath5 and the destination spin @xmath7 attached to the nodes @xmath6 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "a possible transfer of quantum states between @xmath5 and @xmath7 depends on the eigenvectors @xmath24 of @xmath1 .",
    "note that each localized state of the network @xmath88 is a superposition of eigenvectors @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , @xmath5 and @xmath7 can not communicate unless there exists at least one eigenvector @xmath89 that gives non - zero scalar product with both @xmath90 and @xmath91 ; such an eigenvector can be viewed as a communication channel .",
    "note however , that for every connected network in which all coupling constants are reals , such a vector exists . indeed , if @xmath29 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath1 then , by perron - frobenius theorem , @xmath89 is a vector which corresponds to a stationary distribution of a particle in a classical random walk on @xmath1 and so , for connected @xmath1 , we have @xmath92 , for @xmath93 .",
    "observe also that for a connected @xmath1 the largest eigenvalue @xmath29 is always non - degenerate , so we can achieve a near perfect transfer setting @xmath94 , and choosing @xmath65 and @xmath66 so that @xmath95 .",
    "we remark however that for some networks it is not possible to achieve a nearly perfect transfer in a non - resonant way , because for any choice of @xmath96 s and @xmath97 s either the diagonal terms of the @xmath98 projection of the effective hamiltonian are not equal , or the off - diagonal terms vanish .",
    "let us recall that in order to have a nearly perfect transfer between @xmath5 and @xmath7 we should put @xmath75 ; it is also not hard to check that the fidelity of transfer drops down rapidly when the difference @xmath99 grows .",
    "this observation suggests the following multiuser generalization of our communication protocol .",
    "assume that spins @xmath100 are coupled to some spins of a spin network @xmath1 and placed in local magnetic fields @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "then another spin @xmath5 , coupled to a spin from @xmath1 as well , can communicate with any spin @xmath102 by making its own magnetic field @xmath103 equal to @xmath104 , and calibrating appropriately the coupling strength @xmath65 . to guarantee a high fidelity of the state transfer from @xmath5 to @xmath102 we",
    "should ensure that the distance between @xmath105 and the other frequencies @xmath106 , @xmath107 , as well as between @xmath62 and the eigenvalues @xmath38 of @xmath1 ( except , perhaps one of them , when in the resonant case we have @xmath108 ) is large enough . on the other hand ,",
    "a large magnetic field @xmath109 slows down the transfer from @xmath5 to @xmath102 .",
    "thus , choosing frequencies @xmath110 we should keep in mind both the fidelity of the transfer ( which decreases with the distance between @xmath111 and the closest eigenvalue ) and the time of the transmission ( which may increase considerably when @xmath111 is large , say , much larger than the largest eigenvalue of the network ) .",
    "we remark that if in such a protocol another user sets his frequency to the communication frequency , the information will get entangled between him and the intended receiver .",
    "an example of such a disturbance in a system of three spins coupled to a @xmath112-cycle is presented on fig .",
    "the wcs system can be also used for generation of a perfect entanglement .",
    "let us consider first a non - resonant communication between two users .",
    "after the time equal to a half of the transfer time , the state of the system is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is some angle which can be easily computed .",
    "this state can be also written in the form @xmath115 @xmath116 which clearly corresponds to a maximum entanglement between @xmath5 and @xmath7 .    in order to obtain @xmath0 state one",
    "has to consider three spins and a non - resonant effective hamiltonian of the form @xmath117 let us set the initial conditions as @xmath118 .",
    "after an easily computable time , the state of the system becomes a @xmath0 state @xmath119 , for some @xmath114 and @xmath120 ( cf .",
    "[ f3 ] ) .",
    "we can also use a resonant transfer to get an entanglement for @xmath121 users . to this end",
    "we apply the following procedure .",
    "first , one user @xmath122 in an initial state @xmath118 couples to a non - degenerated eigenvalue @xmath29 of the network and waits until the system evolves into @xmath89 .",
    "this evolution is described by the following effective hamiltonian @xmath123 then all @xmath124 users couple to excited @xmath89 state via the effective hamiltonian @xmath125 where @xmath126 for all pairs @xmath127 , and wait until the system evolves to the state @xmath128 note , that this method is similar to the dynamics of the spin star network presented in @xcite . observe also that one can get rid of all relative phases by local one qubit operations .",
    "in the paper we generalized a number of earlier results on quantum information transmission between a source spin and a destination spin using a simple spin network .",
    "we show that a near - perfect state transfer between two spins is possible through a large class of networks , provided that we can control local magnetic field in which the source and the destination spins are embedded .",
    "we also point out that a source spin can choose the destination spin from a number of ` users ' of the network by an appropriate ` tuning ' , i.e. , by carefully selecting its local magnetic field .",
    "the very same mechanism can be used to generate a multispin entanglement state .",
