    "measurements@xcite of rare b meson branching fractions have been performed using the @xcite detector .",
    "b decays in which ckm favored amplitudes are suppressed or forbidden are sensitive to penguin amplitudes and hence to possible non - standard model effects arising from new particles participating in internal loops .",
    "in addition to probes for new physics , many of these modes are also crucial to the full constraint of the `` unitarity triangle '' .",
    "as the definition implies , rare decays typically have branching fractions of less than @xmath1 .",
    "the present data sample of roughly 88 million @xmath2 pairs allows for measurements or stringent limits on many such modes .",
    "the complex ckm@xcite matrix describes the coupling of the charged weak transition @xmath3 , which is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "the non - diagonality of this matrix expresses the fact that the weak isospin doublet members @xmath5 are states of mixed flavor .",
    "we can thus view the ckm matrix as the transformation between the mass and flavor eigenstates of the quarks @xmath6 the unitarity condition implies that there are four free parameters in this matrix , one of which is a phase .",
    "it is through this phase that the standard model can accommodate cp violation . in particular",
    ", the orthogonality requirement between the first and third columns requires @xmath7 which can be expressed geometrically as the so called `` unitarity triangle '' shown in figure  [ fig : unit ] .",
    "information about each side and angle is accessible through a variety of measurements in the b meson system .",
    "the angles are measured through time - dependent decay rate asymmetries , and the sides via direct or indirect measurements of the ckm matrix elements .",
    "measurement of all the components of the unitarity triangle over - constrains the triangle , and thus provides a test of the standard model ( sm ) .",

    "an additional sample of 9.6 fb@xmath22 taken about 40 mev below the peak of the @xmath23 resonance ( `` off - resonance '' ) is used by many analyses to study @xmath24 `` continuum '' backgrounds .",
    "b mesons produced from @xmath23 decays are identified via their unique kinematics . because the mass of the @xmath25 meson pair is nearly that of the @xmath23 , they are produced nearly at rest ( @xmath26 mev / c ) .",
    "use of the beam energy in constraining the kinematics serves to reduce the resolution of theses variables .",

    "figure  [ fig : mes ] shows the @xmath34 distribution for a typical rare mode after all other selections have been applied .",
    "in addition to the kinematics of the @xmath25 meson , signal events are selected by making requirements on the decay products . @xmath25",
    "daughter resonances are required to have invariant masses within a restricted range typically determined by resolution and the need to leave sufficient sideband to determine background levels .",
    "particle identification requirements are made to select some particles and veto sources of background .",
    "all rare analyses suffer from substantial backgrounds , and a variety of techniques are employed to reduce this to manageable levels . in general , backgrounds from other @xmath25 decays are small",
    ". decays resulting from ckm favored @xmath35 transitions have heavier daughters and higher multiplicity final states than do ckm suppressed decays . in order to wrongly reconstruct such a decay as a rare signal , one must typically lose a particle from the true @xmath25 decay , resulting is a substantial shift in the candidate s @xmath30 .",
    "the only exception to this is for rare modes with high final state multiplicities , in which indications of some background have been observed .",
    "while @xmath25 decays from other ckm suppressed transitions have similar kinematics and multiplicities to that of a rare signal , such modes are rare themselves , and require only limited suppression in most analyses .",
    "where @xmath25 backgrounds are present , they typically populate the sidebands of the @xmath30 distribution , but have tails that reach into the signal region as illustrated in figure  [ fig : mesvsde ]     vs @xmath30 distribution after event selection .",

    "although the probability for any given continuum event to satisfy a signal selection is quite small , the numbers favor the continuum . the total production cross section for light quarks ( including charm ) under the @xmath23 is about 3.5 nb , but only 1 nb for the @xmath23 itself . for a mode with an expected branching fraction of order 10@xmath38",
    "this means that continuum events are produced at a rate well in excess of 10@xmath39 times that of the signal .    in order to control continuum backgrounds",
    ", one typically exploits the fact that while the @xmath25 meson pairs are produced near threshold in @xmath23 decays , the light and charm quark pairs which comprise the continuum are produced with a great deal of excess energy .",
    "the result is that for true @xmath25 meson decays , the decay products entering the detector are distributed isotropically in the cm , while the continuum background exhibits a `` jet - like '' topology , with a strong correlation between the @xmath25 candidate decay and jet axes .",
    "the first topological variable typically employed is the angle @xmath40 between the thrust axes of the @xmath25 candidate and the remaining particles in the event .",
    "the sphericity axes may be used almost interchangeably .",
    "the distribution of @xmath41 is nearly uniform for true @xmath25 mesons , but is strongly peaked near 1 for continuum background as is illustrated in figure  [ fig : thrust ] .",
    "if additional background rejection is required , one may consider the remaining event shape information , such as the angles between the @xmath25 thrust and decay axes and the beam as well as the angular energy flow in the event , and combine it into an optimized quantity using a neutral network or a fisher discriminant .",
    "an example of the the separation power of a fisher discriminant after a thrust cut has been made can be found in figure  [ fig : fisher ] .     for a typical @xmath25 meson decay .",
    "the signal distribution ( solid histogram ) is uniform , reflection the random orientation between the @xmath25 candidate thrust axis and the thrust axis of the rest of the event .",

    "these steps are taken to avoid experimenter s bias .",
    "there are two primary methods in which signal event yields are extracted ; the event counting analysis , and the maximum likelihood fit .",
    "detection efficiencies determined from signal monte carlo simulations and data control samples are used to convert yields into branching fraction measurements .",

    "the statistical significance of the signal yield is determined from the change in @xmath49 when the signal yield is forced to zero . if no statistically significant signal is found ( more than 4 standard deviations )",
    ", a 90% confidence level upper limit may be obtained by requiring : @xmath50 full and toy monte carlo simulations are used to verify that the fit is unbiased .    the accuracy with which the pdfs describe the data is of utmost importance in the likelihood fit .",
