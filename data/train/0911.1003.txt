    "deviations from reasonable models are found , indicative of calibration uncertainties .      in the subsequent spectral analysis ,",
    "source spectra were grouped such that each bin contained at least 20 counts and errors are quoted at the 90 per cent confidence level ( = 2.7 for one interesting parameter ) .",
    "spectral fitting was performed using xspec 11.3.0 .",
    "all parameters are reported in the rest frame of the source unless specified otherwise and all fits include galactic absorption with the column density fixed at its nominal value ( 5.3@xmath310@xmath8 @xmath5 ; kalberla et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the  and  observations are separated by nearly five years , but nevertheless appear very similar both in terms of brightness and shape ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : efespec ] ) .",
    "this is interesting considering the extreme spectral variability this object experiences on short ( hourly ) time scales ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : lcs ] ) .",

    "the sharp drop above 8 kev is difficult to detect in the  spectra as the source starts to become background dominated at those energies , however there are indications of it ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 for the addition of 2 new parameters , @xmath13 for the addition of 2 new parameters ) when the spectra are extracted from a circular region with 2 arcmin radius ( smaller than the standard 4.3 arcmin radius ) , in this way reducing the impact of the background . nevertheless , in order to avoid calibration problems of the instrument effective area , in the following analysis we consider the results obtained with the standard 260 arcsec extraction radius .",
    "] ; see also lower panel of figure  [ fig : efespec ] ) . of certainty",
    "is that the feature has not shifted strongly downward in energy .",
    "the marginally detected @xmath14 kev emission line seen in the  observation ( boller et al .",
    "2003 ) is not detected in the  spectrum with an upper limit on its intensity of @xmath15 ph @xmath5 s@xmath6 and on the equivalent width of 110 ev .    while the effective exposure was only three times longer during the  observation , the duration of the observations was substantially longer ( over four days compared to three - quarters of a day for the  observation ) .",
    "consequently , there was a possibility to examine variability on different time scales . despite this , the  and  light curves look similar ( figure  [ fig : lcs ] ) , displaying persistent variability with the largest outbursts being by a factor of @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , the shapes of the rms spectra ( see figure  [ fig : rms ] ) are nearly identical with about a constant amount of variability in the 0.2 - 0.7 kev band , a peak between 1 and 2 kev and lower variability at higher energies , with a drop around 5 - 6 kev .",
    "this does suggest that the processes dominating the variability on short ( hourly ) time scales are likely the same as those which dominate on daily time scales .",
    "the main difference between the two rms spectra is tied to the amplitude of the drops . during the  observation the variability at low energy is about half that at the peak , while during the  pointing the drop is only of the order of 20 per cent .",
    "this difference can be explained by the presence of a stronger constant component during the  observation ( see  5.2 and fig .",
    "noteworthy , is that the huge amplitude ( factor of @xmath17 ) outbursts recorded by @xmath18 ( boller et al .",
    "1996 ) have never been seen since ( dewangan et al .",
    "2002 ; gallo et al .  2004b ; this paper ) .",
    "we first note that a simple power law model fails to reproduce the x - ray source emission because of the large soft excess .",
    "we thus add the contribution from a disc black body emission component ( diskpn , makishima et al .",
    "1986 ; gierlinski et al . 1999 ) .",
    "large residuals are still present at @xmath01.3 kev and between 7 and 8 kev ( see fig .",
    "[ ratdiskpn ] ) .",
    "the black body component is , however , able to reproduce the soft excess emission .",
    "the best fit inner disc temperatures ( assuming an inner disc radius of 6 r@xmath19 ) are t@xmath20 kev and t@xmath21 kev for the  and  data , respectively .",
    "the best fit luminosity of the disc black body component is l@xmath22 and @xmath23 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "figure [ uv ] shows the  ( epic - pn ) and the simultaneous om uvw2 spectra .",
    "the solid line shows the un - absorbed disc black body component ( diskpn ) best fitting the soft x  ray excess emission .",
    "once that this component is extrapolated in the uv band , it fails in reproducing the strong source uv emission . in other words , if the disc black body is responsible for the soft x ",
    "ray excess , the uv flux is severely underestimated and can not be accounted for by the model .",
    "we then fitted the uv and 210 kev data as described in vasudevan & fabian ( 2007 ; 2009 ) . ] .",
    "the black hole mass of iras13224 - 3809 is not well known .",
    "the fast and high degree of variability suggests a small bh mass ( m@xmath240.7 - 1@xmath25 m@xmath26 ; ponti et al . in prep . ) , while considerations based on the high source bolometric luminosity and the ultraviolet emission / absorption components suggest a m@xmath27 from about @xmath28 to @xmath29 m@xmath26 ( leighly & moore 2004 ; leighly 2004 ; wang et al . 2004 ) . to study the impact of the uncertainty associated with the poor knowledge of the bh mass",
    ", we consider three cases with bh masses of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath29 m@xmath26 .",
    "the dotted lines in fig . [ uv ] show the best fit model reproducing the uv and 2 - 10 kev spectra for the different bh masses .",
    "if a bh mass of 10@xmath32 or 10@xmath33 m@xmath26 is assumed , it is not possible to reproduce the soft excess with a standard disc black body component because the disc temperature is too low . on the other hand a lower bh mass , in order to fit the uv data , would imply an un - physically high eddignton accretion rate ( l / l@xmath34 for a 10@xmath35 m@xmath26 , l / l@xmath36 for a 10@xmath32 m@xmath26 ) .    the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ uv ] shows the best fit model assuming a bh mass of 5.6@xmath310@xmath35 m@xmath26 ( wang et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this case",
    "a super - eddington accretion is required ( @xmath37 ) , however a still hotter black body temperature is required to fit the soft excess .",
    "modification to the disc black body emission due to atomic processes ( in particular hydrogen and helium ) are an interesting possibility .",
    "in fact in agn , due to the low free - free and bound - free opacities in the soft x - ray regime ( that allow the diffusion of photons from large thomson depths below the disc surface ) , a high energy tail is generated in addition to the standard uv disk black body shape . however , this component , having a too low intensity and `` temperature '' ( the expected maximum temperature being 50 - 60 ev ) , can not explain the soft excess emission of iras 13224 - 3809 ( ross et al . 1992 ) .    alternatively , as already explored by gierlinski & done ( 2004 ) , a second lower temperature comptonization medium ( with lower energy electrons compared to the ones producing the power law emission above 2 kev ) may fit the soft excess spectral shape .",
    "iras13224 - 3809 makes no exception .",
    "nevertheless , we obtain ( fitting the soft excess with a comptonization component compst in xspec ) an electron temperature t@xmath38 kev and an optical depth @xmath39 .",
    "these values fall within the narrow range of values observed by gierlinski & done ( 2004 ) analysing the soft excess of a large sample of agn .",
    "they observed clustering of all the measured temperatures and optical depths to a narrow range of values that poses serious doubts on the second comptonisation hypothesis for the soft excess ( gierlinski & done 2004 ) and brought the authors to exclude this hypothesis .",
    "thus , although the model can explain the soft excess in any single source , it seems to fail when the big picture is considered .",
    "moreover , we stress that although soft state spectra of gbh can be modelled by two media of comptonised electrons , the observed optical depth , in that case , is definitely smaller than @xmath39 ( as required here ) resulting in a far smoother shape of the soft excess , than the one observed here .",
    "the main conclusion drawn from this exercise is that a unique disc black body component can not reproduce both the uv and soft x - ray data .",
    "the most likely situation is then that a thermal accretion disc component is responsible for most ( if not all ) of the uv emission , while the soft x - ray emission has a different physical origin .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation that in agn , in general , when the soft excess is fitted with a disc black body component , the resulting temperature is observed to be too high and with a too small scatter , compared with expectations ( only in the smaller mass and higher accretion rate agn the wien tail of the disc emission is expected to be observed in the soft x - ray band ) .",
    "for this reason many works suggest that the real origin is tied to ionised absorbing / reflecting material ( gierlinski & done 2004 ; crummy et al .",
    "furthermore , in observations allowing us to study the x  ray variability of this putative thermal component , the expected @xmath40 blackbody relationship is not recovered , casting further doubts on this interpretation ( e.g. ponti et al .",
    "alternatively to the disc black body emission ( or cold comptonization ) thermal models , the entire soft excess may be attributed to the effect of partially ionized gas in the line of sight , absorbing the x  ray continuum which would be then intrinsically more intense and significantly steeper than observed in the 210 kev range . as shown by boller et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the high energy drop at about 8 kev can indeed be produced by a neutral outflowing absorber partially covering the source .",
    "iron overabundance is required to fit the feature .",
    "alternatively , a partial covering ionised absorber , similar to the one suggested for 1h0707 - 495 ( done et al .",
    "2007 ) , may explain the high energy feature of iras13224 - 3809 , although the edge seems too sharp to be produced by partially ionized gas .    nevertheless , we note that to fit the source spectrum below 2 kev two additional components are needed , an emission one ( either a disc black body or a second power law ) for the soft excess and another different absorption component to fit the @xmath01.3 kev structure .",
    "we thus fit the spectrum with a power law plus a disc black body emission absorbed by two ionised partial covering components . with one absorber roughly reproducing the high  energy drop as in boller et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , while the second absorber can reproduce the low energy structure only if significant blue - shifting ( @xmath410.15 - 0.3 c ) is allowed ( fitting the structure with either o viii or fe m uta ) .",
    "no good fit was found with lower outflow velocities .",
    "the main reason is that the model tries to fit the apparent drop below 1 kev with an l - shell iron edge , requiring high iron abundances .",
    "however , as fig .",
    "[ abdu ] shows , this predicts a drop between 0.7 and 0.9 kev due to the m - shell unresolved transition array ( uta ) ( fabian et al .",
    "2009 ; zoghbi et al .",
    "this is a blend of numerous absorption lines arising from the photo - excitation of ions fei -fexvi mainly produced by 2p-3d transitions ( behar et al .",
    "moreover the absorption - dominated model still requires a blackbody to model the soft excess .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath421 , the purpose of this paper is not to fit the complex x  ray spectrum of  with all possible models and compare the best  fitting @xmath43 .",
    "our goal is to seek the simplest possible solution that can explain both the spectral and variability properties with a minimal set of assumptions .",
    "we suspect that combining the soft blackbody and the power law with further layers of partial covering absorbers with different column densities , ionization stages , covering factors , and with unrelated outflowing velocities could easily provide a fair description of the x  ray spectrum .",
    "however , the model would be poorly constrained because of its complexity and would not improve our understanding of the source .",
    "we thus consider here a different interpretation of the x  ray properties of  with the goal of describing the data with a minimal set of physically connected model components .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of 1h0707 - 495 shows similar features at @xmath01.3 kev and in the fe k band .",
    "fabian et al . ( 2009 ) , zoghbi et al . ( 2010 ) and the results of the detailed analysis of the rgs spectra confirm that the origin of the 1 kev feature is not due to absorption ( blustin & fabian 2009 ) . on the other hand",
    "these structures and the timing properties of the source , are consistent with being produced by relativistic fe l and k lines .",
    "thus , we investigate here the consistency of the source emission with the reflection interpretation and its similarity with 1h0707 - 495 .",
    "we thus reproduce the phenomenology of the continuum emission as in fabian et al .",
    "( 2009 ) with a power law plus disc black body emission .",
    "this is a crude approximation of the continuum emission .",
    "in particular , as shown in @xmath424 , the black body component is not associated with the disc emission , being in this interpretation associated with the reflection continuum .",
    "this study is important to check the similarity with 1h0707 - 495 .",
    "we observe that , as in the case of 1h0707 - 495 , a significant improvement is achieved for all fits when two broad disc lines with energies of @xmath44 kev and @xmath45 kev ( depending on the continuum model ) are added to the continuum of 385 and 79 is observed when a broad fe l and fe k line is respectively added to the source spectrum .",
    "the strong statistical variation indicate the importance of these features in the spectrum . ] .",
    "the lines are broadened by the motion of the emitting material on the surface of an accretion disc and by the relativistic effects present in the vicinity of a black hole ( in xspec laor profile , laor 1991 ) .",
    "the model parameters are the emitting energy ( e ) , intensity ( norm ) , disc inner and outer radii ( r@xmath46 , r@xmath47 ) , disc inclination ( i ) and power law disc emissivity index ( q ) .",
    "the energies are broadly consistent with those expected from fe  l@xmath1  and fe  k@xmath1  for a common ionisation parameter ( @xmath48 ; kallman 1995 ; kallman et al . 1996 ; 2004 ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the high- and low - energy laor profiles are consistent with identical blurring parameters ( see tab . [ laors ] ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig : iron ] shows the residuals to black body plus power law continuum fits after setting the normalisation of the laor profiles to zero , clearly showing the large soft and hard residuals , both reminiscent of broad and skewed emission line profiles , as expected in the case of relativistic disc lines .",
    "the resemblance with 1h0707 - 495 is impressive ( fabian et al .",
    "we observe that the relativistic parameters associated with the low and high energy lines are consistent with each other ( see tab .",
    "this suggests that the broadening of the low  energy feature due to the different lines of the fe l complex and to other soft emission lines is likely negligible ( although it is likely that these effects are one of the the causes of the inferred steep disc emissivity profile ) .",
    "given the consistency of the relativistic parameters for the two features , to better constrain the two broad line hypothesis , we impose the same disc inclination , emissivity index and inner disc radius .",
    "the line energies are still consistent with fe l and k emission ( see lower panel of tab .",
    "moreover , the normalization of the fe l and k are in the ratio @xmath49 , consistent with expectations from an ionised disc reflection ( ross & fabian 2005 ; see also ",
    "5.2.1 ) . the equivalent width of the fe l ( fe k ) line is 0.2 kev ( 2.8 kev ) and 0.07 kev ( 0.5 kev ) during the  and  observations , respectively .",
    "we point out that the inferred value of the fe k line ew is extreme . assuming fe solar abundance , the fe k line ew with respect to its own reflection continuum is not expected to be much larger than about 1 kev for spectra with @xmath50 .",
    "a 5 - 10@xmath3solar fe abundance produces a factor  2 - 3 increase in the line ew ( george & fabian 1991 ) which is in principle able to account for the observed ew if the spectrum is reflection - dominated .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the reflection continuum in the fe k band is not a simple power law and has a skewed shape dropping sharply at the fe edge .",
    "hence a simple broad line plus power law fit is very likely to overestimate the line ew because a large part of the reflection continuum is erroneously accounted for by the broad line .",
    "we conclude by pointing out that the numerical results and parameters obtained with the phenomenological model presented above must be taken with caution and the model is presented here only as a guide for the more sophisticated and realistic reflection models that will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "we stress that , as in 1h0707 - 495 , the two main features of the x - ray spectrum , the sharp drops at @xmath01.1 - 1.2 kev and @xmath08.2 kev ( observed frame ) , can be reproduced by two emission lines with similar ratios in the two objects .",
    "we note that , even if still too high , the inclusion in the model of the fe l emission significantly lowers the temperature of the too hot disc component required to fit the soft excess , going from t@xmath51 kev to t@xmath52 kev .",
    "basically , the fe l feature well reproduces the high energy part of the soft excess emission .",

    "this behaviour has been observed in many other sources ( see e.g. fig .",
    "10 of ponti et al . 2006 ) and it can be : i ) either intrinsic due to changes in the parameters of the comptonising phase , producing variations of the observed power law spectral index ; ii ) or spurious being due to the variations of the absorbing material that is dominating the spectral shape ; iii ) or due to a two component model comprising a steep power law varying in normalisation only and a harder and more constant component ( mchardy , papadakis & uttley 1998 ; shih , iwasawa & fabian 2002 ) . the lack of a strong narrow component in the fe k line ( the upper limit on a neutral line being ew @xmath120 ev both for  and  and on a ionised being ew=@xmath121 ev , e=@xmath122 kev for  and @xmath123 ev for ) , excludes a strong contribution from a constant reflection component from distant material .",

    "the presence of this difference in the intensity of the residual reflection component explains also the difference in the shapes of the rms spectra ( see fig .",
    "reflection  dominated spectra have been observed in many agn and in particular in nls1 accreting at a high rate ( zoghbi et al .",
    "2008 ; schartel et al . 2007 ; fabian et al . 2004 ; grupe et al .",

    "bending effects are strong , generating ( as seen at infinity ) a strong reflection and a dim primary source ( miniutti et al . 2003 ; miniutti & fabian 2004 ) . in the most extreme cases ( regime i in miniutti & fabian 2004 ) corresponding to strongly reflection  dominated spectra ( which is the relevant case here ) the light bending model implies steep emissivity profiles and correlated variability between the reflection and primary ( power law ) components .",
    "although the latter is a prediction of the model for reflection  dominated states ( as opposed to less reflection  dominated cases in which the model predicts a more contant reflection ) , correlated variability between the primary and reprocessed component is what is generally expected in any reprocessing model and can not be associated unequivocally with the specific variability model of miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ emis ] shows the disc reflection emissivity index @xmath144 as a function of the 0.510  kev power law flux .",
    "the emissivity index appears to be weakly anti - correlated with flux ( linear pearson correlation coefficient of @xmath145 ) , which is in line with the light bending model predictions in which low flux states are automatically associated with more centrally concentrated disc illumination profiles .",
    "however , even for the most extreme light bending effects , emissivity indices as steep as 6 - 7 are difficult to produce and hence somewhat suspicious . here",
    "we point out only one possible reason : the relativistic blurring model we use is based on the laor ( 1991 ) code and assumes limb darkening , while numerical simulations would in fact suggest that mild limb brightening is more appropriate for disc reflection ( svoboda et al .",
    "in fact , svoboda et al . (",
    "2009 ) have shown that , by applying a limb brightning model to the best - studied broad line case of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , the inner emissivity index can be reduced from @xmath05.3 to @xmath03.7 for similar inclination and black hole spin .",
    "the emissivity index may thus be generally overestimated , especially at relatively high inclination angles such as the one inferred in the present case .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "12 shows the disc ionisation parameter as a function of the direct ( power law ) flux . in this case",
    "the correlation is very poor ( @xmath146 ) meaning that the variations of the disc ionisation parameter do not closely follow the variations of the source flux ( a similar behaviour is present in other sources , i.e. mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ; ballantyne et al .",
    "we point out that , if light bending really plays a role in shaping the general spectral and variability properties of the source , the observed flux can not be directly connected to the flux illuminating the accretion disc ( which is the one to which the ionization should be associated with ) .",
    "this is because , due to light bending , the disc sees a different flux than the observer at infinity . on the other hand",
    ", both the disc ionization state and the reflection intensity should be directly correlated with the flux irradiating the accretion disc .",
    "hence a correlation between reflection intensity and ionization state is generally expected , especially if the bulk of the reflection component comes from a limited region ( e.g. the innermost accretion disc ) .",

    "iras13224 - 3809 is not the only source where the nuclear emission is thought to originate from within the regions where strong gravity effects are not negligible ( fabian & miniutti 2005 ) .",
    "long uninterrupted exposures of such agn have demonstrated that the relation between direct emission and the disc reflection component is complex .",
    "the cases of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and ngc4051 show that the disc reflection component is approximately constant at medium / high fluxes and correlated with the power law at low fluxes where the spectrum becomes more reflection  dominated ( ponti et al .",
    "2006 ; larsson et al .",
    "this is the expected behaviour when the intrinsic luminosity variations of the x - ray source are negligible and most of the flux variability is due to general relativistic effects",
    ". a longer observation of iras13224 - 3809 is required to fully address this issue .      the ratio between fe l and fe k depends on many physical parameters , primarily on the power law index of the illuminating source and on the physical properties of the reflecting material .",
    "kallman ( 1995 ) simulated the expected ratio assuming a slab of optically thin gas with solar abundances photo - ionised by a x - ray power law source with an energy index of -1.5 .",
    "in such conditions the fe l/ fek ratio is expected to be about 3 for an ionisation parameter @xmath148 . to measure the ratio in the case of an optically thick accretion disc with a high fe abundance",
    ", we computed extensive simulations of accretion disc in the same scenario used to compute the ionised reflection model ( ross & fabian 2005 ) . in particular the primary x - ray source illuminating the accretion disc has a power law spectral index of @xmath149 , the disc has a fe abundance 5 times higher than solar and ionisation @xmath150 erg cm s@xmath6 .",
    "the ratio between the intensities of fe l and k has been calculated considering the fe l region extending from 0.71 kev to 1.08 kev , and the fe k region to extend from 6.31 kev to 7.07 kev ( where the smeared fe k - edge begins ) . the continuum has been fitted with a simple straight - line continuum in these two regions and then added up the line photons ( how much the emergent spectrum exceeded the continuum fit ) for each of these regions .",
    "we found a fe l to fe k photon ratio of 44.6 for this model .",
    "the reason that the l line dominates so strongly in this model is that fe xvii dominates over most of the outermost thomson depth , while the k line is suppressed by auger destruction during resonance trapping .",
    "we also observe that , varying the ionisation parameter between 200 and 600 erg cm s@xmath6 , the fel / k ratio has values of a few tens .",
    "these computations depend on the assumption of the straight line continuum and thus do not provide the precise fel / k ratio .",
    "nevertheless , they should provide reasonable values to compare with the phenomenological broad lines model where the continuum is also a straight line .",
    "we , in fact , observe that these values are roughly in agreement with the ones obtained from the fit with broad lines ( see @xmath426 ) .",

    "negative lags indicate that the hard ( power law dominated ) components leads the reflection emission .",
    "the shape of the frequency dependent lags closely resembles the one of 1h0707 - 495 , where for the first time a reverberation lag of 30 s between the continuum and the energy band of the fe l reflection line is detected ( fabian et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the present case a significant detection of the lag",
    "is prevented by the short exposure ( 60 ks , about ten times lower than 1h0707 - 495 ) .",
    "a long uninterrupted observation of iras13224 - 3809 will clarify this issue and serve to scrutinise the reflection dominated interpretation proposed here .",
    "we have studied the x  ray spectral variability of  analyzing the  and  data .",
    "the source shows very similar behaviour during the two observations taken 5 years apart .",
    "in particular it exhibits : i ) a strong soft excess with a sharp feature around 1.2  kev ; ii ) an impressive drop in flux at @xmath08.2  kev ( the drop has not shifted in energy and no narrow component of the fe k line is detected ) .",
    "these features may be reproduced by either absorption or ionized reflection . in the absorption interpretation",
    "the two features imply at least two distinct absorption components , while in the reflection interpretation a single reflection component can explain all the major spectral features .",
    "moreover , the reflection model naturally accounts also for the soft excess , while additional soft ( e.g. blackbody ) components must be included in the absorption  dominated models we have considered . in fact",
    "when the spectrum is fitted with two broad lines , the energies of the lines are consistent with coming from fe  l and fe  k , the shapes are consistent with being produced by the same broadening profile and the ratio between the intensity broadly consistent with expectations from a dominant fe xvii contribution .",
    "this result is very similar to what has been recently reported for a similar object 1h0707 - 495 ( fabian et al .",
    "2009 ) . in that case",
    "the reflection interpretation is strengthened by the detection of a time lag between the soft band ( 0.3 - 1 kev , dominated by the fe l emission ) and the power law , hampered here by the shortness of the  observation .",
    "longer uninterrupted observations are required to study the timing characteristics of  in detail .",
    "we stress , however , that ionised disc reflection not only gives a reasonable fit to the mean spectrum , but also reproduces the source spectral variability .",
    "in particular the variability can be described by a variable power law with constant spectral shape and a reflection component following the power law variations , with residual reflection dominating the spectrum at low fluxes . during the  observation",
    "this residual ionised disc reflection component is more prominent even if the source flux is similar .",
    "the reflection component is affected by relativistic effects , strongly suggesting that it originates in the innermost regions of the accretion disc around a rapidly rotating kerr black hole .",
    "the best fit inner radius of the accretion disc is of the order of 1.2 r@xmath19 with a 90% upper limit of @xmath02  r@xmath19 , implying an almost maximal black hole spin @xmath113 .",
    "the disc illumination radial profile is consistent with a steep power law ( q@xmath057 ) . a weak anti - correlation between the illumination profile and the source direct flux is observed .",
    "this indicates that at lower fluxes the primary emission is likely closer to the back hole . during the low flux states most of the reflection",
    "is produced within a few gravitational radii from the black hole . in such conditions",
    "strong relativistic effects must be at work .    despite being an illustrative toy model , which most likely represents the zeroth - order approximation of the full relativistic cases ,",
    "the light bending model proposed by miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) seems to capture the main characteristics of . in particular",
    "the model predicts the existence of a regime in which the spectrum is strongly reflection - dominated , as we observe here . within this regime ,",
    "the reflection and continuum components are expected to correlate well , while the disc emissivity is anti  correlated with the direct flux ( the power law flux in this case ) .",
    "although we observe both trends , we point out that correlated variability between the primary and reprocessed component is a general prediction of any reflection model . however , the light bending model associates this behaviour only with reflection  dominated states , while in more standard cases , the reprocessed component is predicted to vary less than the primary .",
    "future x  ray observation catching the source in less reflection  dominated states may be important to test the model predictions .",
    "both the strong soft excess and the extreme fe k lines , when fitted with a disc ionised reflection component , require an extremely high level of reflection , near to have a reflection dominated spectrum ( see fig . 8) .",
    "we measure a ratio between the ionised reflection to the power law flux of 1.7 and 0.75 over the 0.001 - 1000 kev band ( the entire band over which the reflection model is computed ) , while the ratio is 3.7 and 1.6 in the observed 0.5 - 10 kev band for the  and  observations , respectively .",
    "we note that the high energy part of the reflected spectrum is less affected by ionisation , thus we estimated the reflection fraction comparing the extrapolated best fit ionised reflection to power law flux ratio in the 20 - 60 kev band ( that results to be about 4.9 and 2.1 ) with the one expected by neutral reflection ( using a pexrav component ) .",
    "a reflection fraction of 7 and 4 are thus estimated in this way .",
    "are such high reflection fractions consistent with the picture described in the light bending model ? as shown in figure 15 the observed values are rather extreme ,",
    "however , they are expected when the primary x - ray source is less than 3 - 4 r@xmath19 above the central black hole ( regime i , see miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "we estimate that , in this condition , only about 1020 % of the primary x - ray source is detected at infinity in the form of the power law emission .",
    "thus , the measured 2 - 10 kev power law luminosity of @xmath151 erg s@xmath6 would correspond to an intrinsic luminosity ( in the frame of the source ) of the order of a few times @xmath152 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "this value is not too large if compared to the bolometric luminosity ( l@xmath153 erg s@xmath6 ) , even assuming a rather extreme bolometric correction ( elvis et al .",
    "1995 ; vasudevan et al . 2007 ; 2009 ) .",
    "also in agreement with such a scenario , we observe that the reflection fraction and the broadness of the line increase lowering the flux , passing from the  to the  observations .",
    "we also observe a poor correlation between disc ionization and observed power law flux . in the framework of the light bending model ,",
    "this is not highly surprising since the disc sees a different continuum than the observer precisely because of light bending .",
    "however , the disc ionization and the reflection intensity track each other reasonably well , which is consistent with our reflection interpretation since they both respond to the flux irradiating the disc .",
    "the strong ionised reflection interpretation requires a very high value of the disc illumination parameter , but also of the iron abundance ( @xmath05 times solar ) .",
    "nevertheless it is important to stress that an even higher iron abundance is required in the partial covering interpretation ( boller et al .",
    "moreover supersolar metal abundances of the environment around supermassive black holes seem to be the rule , more than the exception .",
    "for example , the quasar environments are metal - rich with typically gas abundances several times solar at all redshifts ( hamann et al .",
    "in fact , several methods based on optical - uv broad and narrow emission and absorption lines agree in observing supersolar metal abundances in large samples of quasars .",
    "the typical metallicity is observed to be roughly 2 - 4 times solar ( dietrich et al .",

    "our galactic centre , even if it is not hosting , at the moment ( ponti et al .",
    "2010 ) , an accreting black hole , contains large molecular clouds with fe abundances higher than solar .",

    "2004 ; terrier et al .",
