    "we also notice that the critical value of the spin liquid - nel afm boundary in the hubbard model@xcite is smaller than that of ours , this is attributed to the duplicate effects of the spin fluctuations and the charge fluctuations , which prevent the formation of magnetic long - range order .",
    "we find that beyond the phase transition temperature @xmath175 , the magnetic susceptibility recovers the usual curie behavior .",
    "these results demonstrated that the schwinger - boson mean - field theory works well for calculating thermodynamic properties of the frustrated @xmath15 heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice , even if in the high temperature regime without magnetic order .",
    "this arises from the finite value of the gap parameters @xmath60 , even if the order parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 vanish in the high temperature .",
    "more importantly , we present the low - temperature exponential behavior of the specific heat , magnetic susceptibility and knight shift , providing a clue for searching the candidate compounds with exotic spin liquid phase in experiments . we also illustrate that it is not easy for an external magnetic field destroy the spin liquid phase , showing a self - protecting and robust characteristics of this quantum phase .",
