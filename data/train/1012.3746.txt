    "in last years , a lot of experimental and theoretical effort was made to study two - photon exchange ( tpe ) in the elastic electron - proton scattering .",
    "this activity was motivated by the discovery of the problem in the proton form factor measurements : values of form factor ratio @xmath2 obtained by rosenbluth separation and polarization transfer methods were is strong disagreement .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the discrepancy is caused by tpe , but still no direct experimental observations of tpe exist .",
    "previously , several attempts were made to extract values of tpe amplitudes from available experimental data in more or less model - independent way @xcite . however , lack of precise data and/or theoretical understanding of tpe prevented from obtaining sufficiently accurate estimates for the amplitudes . in particular , it was difficult to determine the dependence of tpe amplitudes on the kinematical parameter @xmath3 , since the @xmath3 dependence of polarization observables was not known experimentally .",
    "recently , a search for tpe effects in polarization observables was reported @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "ratio of transverse and longitudinal proton polarization components ( polarization ratio ) was measured with significantly improved precision for @xmath4 and wide range of the parameter @xmath3 .    in the present paper we use latest experimental data to determine tpe amplitudes at @xmath4 following the ideas of ref .",
    "@xcite with some improvements ( described below ) .",
    "we will try to obtain as much information on tpe amplitudes as possible , while avoiding unnecessary assumptions . in our analysis",
    "we only assume that tpe is the sole reason for the discrepancy between cross - section and polarization data , and rely on the following experimental and theoretical facts :    1 .   the reduced cross - section exhibits no or small nonlinearity in @xmath3 ( @xcite , also verified in the present work ) .",
    "2 .   the polarization ratio does not vary significantly with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "3 .   tpe amplitudes must vanish at @xmath5 ( because they can be represented by convergent dispersion integral ; @xmath5 implies @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is c.m .",
    "energy squared ) .",
    "the latter point was missing in ref .",
    "there were no recent cross - section measurements in the @xmath8 region of our interest , so we have to use older data .",
    "these data were analyzed before , but for our paper to be self - contained we repeat such an analysis here .",
    "we have selected data in the range @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding reduced cross - sections were first multiplied by @xmath10 , to eliminate most of the @xmath8 dependence .",
    "then , since in born approximation the reduced cross - section is _",
    "r = g_m^2 + g_e^2 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are electric and magnetic form factors , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is proton mass , the resulting values were fitted with the function a + b + c ( q^2 - 2.5 ^2 ) the last term takes into account @xmath8 dependence of @xmath15 term in @xmath16 .",
    "we obtain rather acceptable fit with @xmath17 for 28 d.o.f . , indicating that the linearity of @xmath16 in @xmath3 is indeed supported by the data .",
    "we will mainly need the quantity r_lt^2 = b / a which would be equal to @xmath18 at @xmath0 in born approximation .",
    "we obtain @xmath19 , in agreement with the results ref .  @xcite ( 0.1015 ) . in further calculations we use the first value .",
    "we will use mostly the same notation as in ref .",
    "we denote particle momenta according to e(k)+p(p)e(k)+p(p ) , and define @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 . in presence of tpe",
    ", elastic electron - proton scattering amplitude has the form    m = & |u_u |u ( f_1 ^- f_2 [ ^,^ ] + .",
    "k_^ ) u    where @xmath24 is fine structure constant , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) are initial and final electron ( proton ) spinors , and @xmath29 are scalar invariant amplitudes .",
    "it is convenient to introduce linear combinations @xcite    rclcl _ e & = & f_1 - f_2 + f_3/4m^2 & = & g_e + _ e + _ m & = & f_1 + f_2 + f_3/4m^2 & = & g_m + _ m + _ 3 & = & f_3/4m^2 & = & _ 3    where @xmath30 and prefix @xmath31 indicates tpe contribution .",
    "the tpe amplitudes @xmath32 are complex , but only their real parts contribute to the observables discussed here . everywhere",
    "below , speaking of the amplitudes , we will mean their real parts . neglecting terms of order @xmath33 , the reduced cross - section and polarization ratio",
    "can be written as _",
    "r & = & g_m^2 \\ { + r_0 ^ 2 + 2 + 2r_0 ^ 2 } [ sigma_r ] + r & = & r_0 \\ { 1 + - - } [ r ] where @xmath34 .",
    "note that our definition of @xmath35 does not include a factor of @xmath36 , thus @xmath35 ( and @xmath37 ) is rather small quantity ( @xmath38 for @xmath39 ) .",
    "utilizing this fact we will neglect last term in eq.([sigma_r ] ) ( the validity of this approximation will be checked afterwards ) . then , as it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the observed cross - section linearity in @xmath3 _ forces _ us to parameterize tpe amplitude @xmath1 as a linear function of @xmath3 . to vanish at @xmath5",
    ", it must have the form [ cg_m ] _ m / g_m = a(1- ) then we have _",
    "r = g_m^2 \\ { + r_0 ^ 2 + 2 a ( 1 - ) } and the cross - section slope is r_lt^2 = from which we obtain [ a ] a = together with eq.([cg_m ] ) , this fully determines the amplitude @xmath1 . as a first approximation",
    ", we replace @xmath40 by experimental value of polarization ratio , @xmath41 @xcite , and obtain numerically [ anum ] a = -0.0250 0.0035 thus extracted amplitude @xmath42 is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] with @xmath43 error band . the theoretical prediction @xcite is also shown and agrees rather well with our result .",
    "( grey , @xmath43 band ) and its theoretical estimates , calculated with : elastic intermediate state only @xcite ( dashed ) , elastic + @xmath44 resonance @xcite ( solid).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    now we will take a closer look on the polarization ratio @xmath35 , which allows us to get some information about the amplitude @xmath45 .",
    "first , we note that the last term in eq.([r ] ) should be very small , because the factor @xmath46 is not greater than 0.18 for @xmath47 .",
    "thus we are left with [ r2 ] r = r_0 \\ { 1 + - } since both @xmath1 and @xmath45 vanish at @xmath5 , we obviously have r_0 = .",
    "r |_=1 , _ e - r_0 _ m = r - r_0 the experiment says that , at @xmath0 , there is no significant variation of @xmath35 with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this implies [ cg_e ] r r_0 _ e r_0 _ m ( which also justifies using @xmath35 instead of @xmath37 in eq.([a ] ) ) .",
    "now we can cross - check that the amplitude @xmath45 has small impact on the cross - section . using eqs.([cg_m],[a],[cg_e ] ) , we calculate the corresponding correction ( the last term of eq.([sigma_r ] ) ) and subtract it from the data",
    ". then we repeat cross - section fitting and extraction of @xmath1 , as described above .",
    "we obtain @xmath48 , i.e. practically no change with respect to ( [ anum ] ) .",
    "eqs.([cg_e ] ) are , of course , a rough estimate . in particular , they do not allow to estimate the uncertainty of @xmath45 .",
    "an accurate @xmath49 extraction with estimation of uncertainties requires determination of the small quantity @xmath50 , for which the present data hardly suffice .",
    "nevertheless , note that theoretical calculations also show relative smallness of @xmath51 , which arises from significant cancellation between proton and @xmath44 resonance contributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    ", contribution of proton ( dashed ) , @xmath44 resonance ( dash - dotted ) , and total ( solid ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in the experiment @xcite , one more quantity was measured : longitudinal polarization of the final proton , @xmath52 . in principle , this data could help to determine the remaining amplitude @xmath53 .",
    "the tpe correction to @xmath52 is given by p_l = - 2p_l \\ { + } where @xmath54 is tpe correction to polarization ratio according to eq.([r2 ] ) .",
    "as @xmath55 , the first term is negligible , and the deviation of @xmath52 from its born value is governed by the amplitude @xmath53 .",
    "however , two available data points are too few to make any statements about @xmath3 dependence of @xmath53",
    ". we can only compute @xmath53 at the @xmath3 values of experimental data .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . obviously , their precision is insufficient to make a meaningful comparison with theory .",
    "the obtained values are compatible with zero , and do not contradict theoretical estimates as well .    .",
    "statistical and systematic errors are added in quadrature , inner bars  pure statistical errors .",
    "theoretical calculations with : elastic intermediate state only @xcite ( dashed ) , elastic + @xmath44 resonance @xcite ( solid).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "in summary , we have tried to extract tpe amplitudes for the elastic electron - proton scattering at @xmath0 solely from the experimental data on cross - sections and polarization observables .",
    "having defined three independent amplitudes @xmath1 , @xmath45 and @xmath53 , we found that the effect of these amplitudes on the observables is `` decoupled '' : the cross - section is mainly influenced by @xmath1 , the polarization ratio  by @xmath45 and @xmath1 , longitudinal polarization component  by @xmath53 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath1 can be extracted with approximately 10% accuracy and is in good agreement with theoretical calculations .",
    "the weakness of polarization ratio variation with @xmath3 implies approximate equality @xmath56 . as to the amplitude @xmath53 , present experimental data are consistent with @xmath57 . to allow for more accurate extraction of @xmath45 and @xmath53 , further polarization measurements at different @xmath3",
    "are clearly needed .",
    "it is also worth noting that momentum transfer value @xmath4 was not good choice for the experiment @xcite : just in this region tpe correction to polarization ratio is especially small because elastic and @xmath44 resonance contributions almost cancel each other .",
    "recently , a preprint @xcite appeared , in which the same problem was considered .",
    "however , authors have used certain parameterization of polarization component @xmath52 , which , to our opinion , is not well motivated by experimental data . their results strongly differ from ours as well as from theoretical calculations .",
