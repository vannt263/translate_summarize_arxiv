    "feynman , in the first chapter of his _ lectures on physics _",
    "@xcite , states that _",
    "`` if , in some cataclysm , all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed , and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures , what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words ?",
    "i believe it is the atomic hypothesis ( or the atomic fact or whatever you wish to call it ) that all things are made of atoms - little particles that move around in perpetual motion , attracting each other when they are a little distance apart , but repelling upon being squeezed into one another . '' _    if the atomic hypothesis is such an important principle , physics has to take advantage of this fact , and , properly formulated , should be included as a preliminary fundamental principle of elementary particle physics .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to show that the atomic hypothesis not only states the indivisibility of elementary particles , but also that these ultimate objects , if not annihilated , can not be modified so that all states of an elementary particle are only kinematical modifications of any one of them and , therefore , no excited states are allowed .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give elementary geometrical arguments leading to the plausible conclusion that the most general motion of the centre - of - charge of a classical elementary spinning particle is a helical motion at the speed of light , so that the location of the charge satisfies , in general , a fourth - order differential equation , which is the most general differential equation satisfied by a point in three - dimensional space .    in the section [ sec : part ]",
    "we analyse three fundamental principles , namely the restricted relativity principle , the atomic principle and the variational principle , which allow us to obtain a completely general formalism for describing , at the classical level , elementary spinning particles @xcite .",
    "the quantization of this formalism is obtained by replacing the variational principle by the uncertainty principle in the form postulated by feynman , i.e. in terms of the path integral approach .    in section [ kin ]",
    "we summarize how the above fundamental principles produce a general kinematical formalism for describing elementary particles .",
    "dirac s equation is obtained when quantizing precisely the classical system whose charge is moving along a helix , at the speed of light , as suggested by the above elementary arguments .",
    "the main features of a classical dirac particle are outlined in section 5 .",
    "the importance of the atomic principle is stressed in section [ sec : physics ] , when analysing the interaction of two dirac particles .",
    "the atomic principle restricts the dependence of the interaction lagrangian to the positions and velocities of both particles , but not to the accelerations and angular velocities .",
    "it is suggesting a kind of minimal coupling interaction between the currents of both particles .",
    "finally , section [ sec : predict ] is devoted to some predictions of the kinematical formalism .",
    "it is shown that there is a diference in chirality between matter and antimatter , at the classical level .",
    "matter is left - handed while antimatter is right - handed .",
    "it is also predicted that particles and antiparticles must necesarilly have the same relative orientation between the spin and magnetic moment .",
    "the analysis of a very close electron - electron interaction shows that , if certain boundary conditions are fulfilled , two electrons with their spins parallel can form , from a classical point of view , a metastable bound state .",
    "we finish with some final conclusions .",
    "as is well known in differential geometry , a continuous and differentiable curve in three - dimensional space , @xmath0 , has associated three orthogonal unit vectors , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , called respectively the tangent , normal and binormal . if using the arc length @xmath4 as the curve parameter , they satisfy the frenet - serret equations @xmath5 where the overdot means @xmath6 .",
    "the knowledge of the curvature @xmath7 and torsion @xmath8 , together the boundary values @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , completely determine the curve , because the above equations are integrable .",
    "if we call @xmath13 , and in particular @xmath14 , and eliminate the three unit vectors among the succesive derivatives @xmath15 , @xmath16 , one obtains that the most general differential equation satisfied by the point @xmath17 , is the fourth order differential system @xmath18 let us consider that an elementary particle is a localized mechanical system . by localized we mean that , at least , is described by the evolution of a single point @xmath17 .",
    "this point could be the centre - of - mass , but in order to determine the external forces to obtain the centre - of - mass evolution , we also need to know the location of the centre - of - charge to compute the actions of the external fields .",
    "let us assume that the elementary particle is charged .",
    "its electric structure can be reduced to the location of the centre - of - charge @xmath17 and the subsequent multipoles located at this point . if its electric field is spherically symmetric we are reduced to know the evolution just of the centre - of - charge .",
    "we do not make the assumption that the centre - of - mass and the centre - of - charge are necessarily the same point . as we shall see this is not true for spinning particles , where the centre - of - mass evolution is some average of the evolution of the centre - of - charge .    by the previous arguments , the centre - of - charge of an elementary particle will satisfy , in general , a fourth order differential equation of the form ( [ eq : masgeneral ] ) where @xmath7 and @xmath8 will depend on the external interaction .",
    "let us assume now that the motion of the particle is free .",
    "this means that we can not distinguish one point of the evolution from another , so that the above equations ( [ eq : masgeneral ] ) must be explicitely independent of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the curvature and torsion are necessarily constants of the motion .",
    "thus @xmath19 , and , in the free case , these equations are reduced to @xmath20 if the curvature and torsion are constant the curve is a helix , which can be factorized in terms of a central point @xmath21 which is moving in a straight trajectory , while the point @xmath17 satisfies @xmath22 an isotropic harmonic motion of frequency @xmath23 , around point @xmath24 .",
    "the point @xmath24 clearly represents the centre - of - mass position of a free particle .",
    "going further , let us assume that the free evolution is analysed by some inertial observer .",
    "then this observer can not distinguish one instant from another , so that , the arc length @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the velocity of the point , must be also independent of the time @xmath27 .",
    "the centre - of - charge of a free elementary particle is describing a helix at a constant velocity for any inertial observer .",
    "if we make a nonrelativistic analysis , the relationship of the velocity measurements among two arbitrary inertial observers @xmath28 and @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the constant velocity of @xmath28 as measured by @xmath29 and the constant rotation matrix @xmath32 is their relative orientation .",
    "now , @xmath33 if @xmath34 has to be also constant for observer @xmath29 , irrespective of @xmath31 and of the rotation matrix @xmath32 , this means that the vector @xmath35 must be a constant vector .",
    "the centre - of - charge necessarily moves along a straight trajectory at a constant velocity , for every inertial observer , and the above general helix degenerates into a straight line and @xmath36 .",
    "this is the usual description of the spinless or pointlike free elementary particle , whose centre - of - charge and centre - of - mass are represented by the same point .",
    "however , in a relativistic analysis , there is one alternative not included in the nonrelativistic approach .",
    "the possibility that the charge of an elementary particle will be moving at the speed of light and , in that case , @xmath37 , for any inertial observer .",
    "this means that the center of the helix is always moving at a velocity @xmath38 , and , as will be shown , it represents the centre - of - mass , this particle is a massive particle . in a variational description of this system",
    "the lagrangian should depend up to the acceleration of the point @xmath17 in order to obtain fourth - order differential equations .",
    "this dependence on the acceleration will give a contribution to the spin of the particle .",
    "the motion of the charge around the centre - of - mass produces the magnetic moment of the particle .    in summary",
    ", there are only two possibilities for a free motion of the charge of an elementary particle .",
    "one , the charge is moving along a straight line at any constant velocity , and the system has no magnetic moment . in the other ,",
    "the particle has spin and magnetic moment , the centre - of - mass and centre - of - charge are different points and the charge moves along a helix at the speed of light . because all known elementary particles , quarks and leptons , are spin @xmath39 particles , we are left only with the last possibility .",
    "this is consistent with dirac s theory of the electron , because the eigenvalues of the components of dirac s velocity operator are @xmath40 and we can interpret the corresponding point as representing the centre - of - charge .",
    "this last possiblity is the description of the centre - of - charge of a relativistic spinning elementary particle obtained in the proposed general kinematical formalism @xcite , and which satisfies dirac s equation when quantized .    in this formalism dirac particles are localized and also orientable mechanical systems . by orientable we mean that we have to attach to the above point @xmath17 , which represents the position of the charge , a local cartesian frame to describe its spatial orientation .",
    "the rotation of the frame will also contribute to the total spin of the particle .",
    "when quantizing the system , the spin @xmath39 is coming from the presence of the orientation variables . otherwise ,",
    "if there are no orientation variables , no spin @xmath39 structure is described when quantizing the system .",
    "the dependence of the lagrangian on the acceleration is necessary for the particle to have magnetic moment and for the separation between the centre - of - mass and centre - of - charge .",
    "the restricted relativity principle states that , in absence of gravitation , there exists a set of equivalent observers , historically called _ inertial observers _ , for whom the laws of physics must be the same .",
    "this statement is an empty statement if not complemented with the assumption that the way two equivalent observers relate the measurement of any physical magnitude depends only of how they relate the measurements of spacetime events .",
    "they are thus defined with respect to each other by a spacetime transformation .",
    "the set of these transformations for all observers form a group , the kinematical group , which must be defined as the fundamental mathematical object of the formalism .",
    "it is this _ geometrization _ of spacetime which establishes the mathematical framework of the relativity principle .",
    "the atomic principle admits that matter can not be divided indefinitely . after a finite number of steps in the division of a portion of matter we reach an ultimate object , an _ elementary particle_. in this way all known matter is finally made of these atom - little particles .",
    "then , what is the difference between an elementary particle and any other little system ? we need to distinguish theoretically a true elementary particle from a bound system of elementary particles .",
    "otherwise the atomic hypothesis will be also an empty statement .",
    "this requires a proper definition of an elementary particle .",
    "the idea is that an electron , if not annihilated with its antiparticle , always remains an electron in any process of interaction .",
    "it thus means that an elementary particle has no excited states and , if not destroyed , we can never modify its internal structure , so that all possible states are only kinematical modifications of any one of them .",
    "if the state of an elementary particle changes , it is always possible to find another inertial observer who describes the particle in the same state as in the previous instant .",
    "the variational principle recognizes that the the action of the evolution of any mechanical system between some initial and final states must be stationary .",
    "this completes the classical framework . for the quantum description we must susbtitute this last variational principle by the uncertainty principle , in the form proposed by feynman : all paths of the evolution of any mechanical system between some initial and final states",
    "are equally probable . for each path a probability amplitude is defined , which is a complex number of the same magnitude but whose phase is the action of the system between the end points @xmath41 and @xmath42 along the corresponding path .",
    "feynman s total probability amplitude @xmath43 is the sum , or path integral , of the probability amplitudes for all paths joining these points . if we call kinematical variables to these classical variables which define the initial and final states of the variational description , these variables become , after quantization , the arguments of the wave function . in this way ,",
    "classical and quantum mechanics are described in terms of exactly the same set of classical variables and its dynamics in terms of initial and final kinematical states .",
    "we want to emphasize the importance of the identification of the kinematical variables , and the interest of rewriting the lagrangian formalism in terms of these variables .",
    "the definition of elementary particle implies that its states can be described by a finite set of variables .",
    "let us represent by @xmath41 the values of the fixed set of variables which define the initial variational state , and , similarly , by @xmath42 the final values of these variables .",
    "if the system is elementary , the final state @xmath42 is a kinematical modification of @xmath41 , so that there will exist some kinematical group element @xmath44 such that @xmath45 , for any @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the kinematical variables , which define the initial and final states of the evolution in the variational description , are a finite set of variables which necessarily span a homogeneous space of the kinematical group .",
    "the manifold they span is larger than the configuration space and , in addition to the independent degrees of freedom , it also includes the derivatives of the degrees of freedom up to one order less than the highest order they have in the lagrangian .",
    "the lagrangian for describing these systems will be thus dependent on these kinematical variables @xmath46 and their next order time derivative . if the evolution is described in terms of some group invariant evolution parameter @xmath47 , then , when writting the lagrangian not in terms of the independent degrees of freedom but as a function of the kinematical variables and their @xmath48derivatives , @xmath49 , it becomes a homogeneous function of first degree of the @xmath50derivatives of all kinematical variables .",
    "this feature will allow us to make a theoretical analysis without postulating any particular lagrangian .",
    "the formalism is completely general and can accomodate to any kinematical group we consider as the spacetime symmetry group of the theory .",
    "but at the same time it is very restrictive , because once this kinematical group is fixed the kind of classical variables which define the initial and final states of an elementary particle in a variational approach , are restricted to belong to homogeneous spaces of the group .",
    "this kinematical group is the fundamental object of the formalism and , therefore , we call the formalism _ kinematical _ , to stress this fact .",
    "all elementary systems described within this formalism have the feature that , when quantized , their hilbert space of pure states carries a projective unitary irreducible representation of the kinematical group .",
    "it is through feynman s path integral approach that both formalisms complement each other . for the galilei and poincar groups ,",
    "the most general homogeneous space is spanned by a set of 10 variables , the same number and with the same geometrical interpretation as the group parameters , @xmath51 , interpreted as the time , position of the charge , velocity of the charge and orientation , respectively . in the relativistic case",
    "we have three maximal , disjoint , homogeneous spaces spanned by these variables , according to the value of the velocity @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the quantization of the manifold with @xmath53 , produces dirac s equation @xcite . if @xmath55 are the kinematical variables , then the lagrangian will also depend on the acceleration and on the angular velocity .",
    "the dynamical equations for the point @xmath17 will be , in general , of fourth order .",
    "a general spinning elementary particle is just a localized and orientable mechanical system . by localized",
    "we mean that to analyse its evolution in space we have just to describe the evolution of a single point @xmath17 , where the charge is located and in terms of which the possible interactions are determined .",
    "this point @xmath17 also represents the centre - of - mass of the system for spinless particles , while for spinning ones must necessarily be a different point than @xmath24 , the centre - of - mass , very well defined classically and where we can locate the mass of the particle .",
    "it is the motion of the charge around the centre - of - mass which gives rise to a classical interpretation of the _ zitterbewegung _ and also to the dipole structure of the particle . by orientable",
    "we mean that in addition to the description of the evolution of the point charge we also need to describe the change of orientation of the system @xmath56 , by analysing the evolution of a local comoving and rotating frame attached to that point",
    ". an elementary spinning particle is thus described as we use to describe a rigid body but with some differences : we have not to talk about size or shape and the point does not represent the centre - of - mass but rather the centre - of - charge .",
    "it is allowed to satisfy a fourth order differential equation and , for a dirac particle , it moves at the speed of light .",
    "this model of elementary spinning particle was already quantized through feynman s path integral method @xcite and shown to satisfy dirac s equation .",
    "therefore it corresponds to a classical spinning model of a spin 1/2 object when quantized . the classical expression which gives rise to dirac",
    "s equation is @xmath57 where the energy @xmath58 is expressed as the sum of two terms , @xmath59 , or translational energy and the other , which depends on the spin of the system , or rotational energy .",
    "this part can never vanish for any observer , while the first one is zero for the centre - of - mass observer .",
    "the spin comes from the dependence of the lagrangian of both , the acceleration @xmath60 , and the angular velocity @xmath61 , and if we define @xmath62 it takes the form @xmath63 the first part @xmath64 , or _ zitterbewegung _",
    "part , is related to the separation between the centre - of - charge from the centre - of - mass and takes into account this relative orbital motion .",
    "it quantizes with integer values .",
    "the second part @xmath65 is the rotational part of the body frame and quantizes with both integer and half - integer values .",
    "the total angular momentum with respect to the origin of observer s frame is @xmath66 so that the spin @xmath67 is the angular momentum of the system with respect to the centre - of - charge @xmath17 , and not with respect to the centre - of - mass @xmath24 .",
    "this is the reason why for a free particle it is not a conserved quantity , but it satisfies the dynamical equation @xmath68 this is exactly the same dynamical equation satisfied by dirac s spin operator in the quantum case . if at point @xmath17 there is defined some external force @xmath69 , the total angular momentum is no longer conserved and thus @xmath70 and because @xmath71 , dirac s spin @xmath67 also satisfies the dynamical equation ( [ eq : dynspin ] ) for an interacting particle .",
    "this has to be taken into account when comparing the analysis of this spin with other approaches , for instance , with bargmann - michel - telegdi spin observable @xcite , which clearly represents the angular momentum with respect to the centre - of - mass of the system .",
    "when expressed the spin and the centre - of - mass position in terms of the kinematical variables and their derivates , they take , respectively , the form @xmath72 dirac s spin is always orthogonal to the osculator plane of the trajectory of the charge @xmath17 , in the direction opposite to the binormal for a positive energy particle , and the acceleration is pointing from @xmath17 to the centre - of - mass , like in a helix .",
    "it is shown that the dynamical equation of point @xmath17 for the free particle and in the centre - of - mass frame is given by @xmath73 and where the spin vector @xmath67 is constant in this frame , as depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "the radius of the zitterbewegung motion is @xmath74 , and the angular velocity @xmath75 .",
    "when considered in the centre - of mass frame and all translational degrees of freedom are supressed , it is a system of three degrees of freedom ; two are the @xmath46 and @xmath76 components of the position of the charge on the zitterbewegung plane and the third is the phase of the rotation of the body frame .",
    "this phase is the same as the phase of the orbital motion and because the velocity @xmath53 is constant , we are just left with a single and independent degree of freedom , for instance , the @xmath46 coordinate .",
    "the dirac particle , in the centre - of - mass frame , is a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath77 .",
    "we can allow the system to have excited states , but the atomic principle suggests that an elementary particle can not have excited states and that the only allowed state in the centre of mass frame , corresponds to the ground state .",
    "its quantized ground energy @xmath78 is identified with the particle rest frame energy @xmath79 . in this way , because @xmath75 , the classical spin @xmath80 takes the value @xmath81 , when quantized .",
    "if the state of the particle , in the centre of mass frame , was some other excited state the value of the classical parameter @xmath80 will be different than @xmath81 , and thus contradictory with the condition that this system satisfies dirac s equation .",
    "therefore , the atomic hypothesis interpreted in the sense that the system has no excited states produces the same result for the quantized spin than feynman s quantization .        when seen from an arbitrary observer ( see figure 2 ) , the motion of the charge is a helix , so that according to ( [ eq : dynspin ] ) dirac s spin preccess around the direction of the conserved linear momentum @xmath82 . for a free particle ,",
    "the centre - of - mass spin @xmath83 is a conserved quantity .",
    "the centre - of - mass velocity is @xmath84 , and the linear momentum is written as usual as @xmath85 , so that the transversal motion of the charge is at the velocity @xmath86 .",
    "a moving electron takes a time @xmath87 times longer than for an electron at rest to complete a turn , as a result of the time dilation measurement .        in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have shown that the spacetime symmetry group for a dirac particle , can be enlarged to include also spacetime dilations and local rotations of the body frame .",
    "this group is @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the weyl group , i.e. , the poincar group @xmath90 enlarged with spacetime dilations and @xmath91 is the group of local rotations of the body frame , which commutes with @xmath89 . because the weyl group has no central extensions @xcite , the lagrangian for a free dirac particle is also invariant under this enlarged group .    if we consider this new group as the kinematical group of the theory , then the kinematical variables of a dirac particle are reduced to time @xmath27 , position of a point @xmath17 , where the charge of the particle is located , its velocity @xmath35 with the constraint @xmath53 , the orientation @xmath56 which can be interpreted as the orientation of a local frame with origin at point @xmath17 and characterized by three parameters of a suitable parameterization of the rotation group and , finally , a dimensionless scale @xmath92 of the internal motion of the charge around the centre - of - mass .",
    "if the particle has spin @xmath93 and mass @xmath94 , then a length scale factor @xmath74 and a time scale factor @xmath95 can be defined , such that all kinematical variables for the variational description can be taken dimensionless .",
    "it is this argument which justifies the enlargement of the spacetime symmetry group , to include spacetime dilations which preserve the speed of light .",
    "the casimir operators of the enlarged group are the absolute value of the spin @xmath80 , which is the casimir operator of the weyl group @xmath89 , and the absolute value @xmath96 of the spin projection operator on the body frame of the rotational part of the spin @xmath97 which corresponds to the casimir operator of the @xmath91 part . here",
    "@xmath98 , @xmath99 represent the three unit vectors of the local frame attached to the point @xmath17 .",
    "a dirac particle , with the enlarged group @xmath88 as its kinematical group , has as intrinsic properties the spin @xmath80 and the spin projection @xmath96 which take both the eigenvalue @xmath39 when quantized @xcite . by this reason , the four components of dirac s",
    "spinor can be classified according to the @xmath100 eigenvalues of the @xmath101 and @xmath102 components of these spin operators .",
    "another important aspect of the atomic principle appears when we analyse the interaction between two dirac particles @xcite .",
    "the general structure of the free lagrangian is @xmath103 because the lagrangian is a homogeneous function of first degree in terms of the derivativatives of the kinematical variables . here , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "when we consider a compound system of two dirac particles , the general lagrangian will have the form @xmath109 , in terms of the free lagrangians @xmath110 and @xmath111 for each particle and an interaction lagrangian @xmath112 .",
    "the free lagrangian for each particle , will have the general form ( [ lag ] ) in terms of the corresponding kinematical variables of each particle .",
    "the interaction lagrangian will be , in general , a homogeneous function of first degree in terms of the derivatives of all kinematical variables of both particles .",
    "but if we assume the atomic principle , the internal structure of each particle can not be modified .",
    "this means that the spin @xmath80 and the spin projection on the body frame @xmath96 for each particle have to be obtained only from the corresponding free lagrangian .",
    "this forbids the dependence of the interaction lagrangian on the acceleration and angular velocity of the particles .",
    "a final invariance under spacetime dilations to obtain a lagrangian invariant under the new kinematical group @xmath88 , gives rise to the interaction lagrangian @xmath113 where @xmath44 is a coupling constant and the subindexes refer to the corresponding particles .",
    "this lagrangian is clearly invariant under the interchange @xmath114 of both particles .",
    "when making a synchronous desciption for any arbitrary observer , it becomes @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the instantaneous separation between the corresponding charges .",
    "when the spin of both particles is supressed , by taking in the low energy limit , the average values of the velocities of both charges will vanish , and the lagrangian becomes the instantaneous coulomb lagrangian between two point charges , thus suggesting that @xmath117 .",
    "it is with the use of this interaction lagrangian that the formation of bound states will be analysed in the next section .    in quantum electrodynamics",
    "the interaction lagrangian between dirac particles is obtained through the local gauge invariance prescription for the dirac field .",
    "this requirement predicts the existence of a massless spin 1 field so that the interaction between dirac particles is mediated through the gauge photon field in the form @xmath118 , where the particle current @xmath119 is coupled to the electromagnetic field @xmath120 . in classical physics",
    "we have no means to describe , in a system of a finite number of degrees of freedom , the possibility of changing the number of particles and how intermediate particles could be created .",
    "we express the interaction only in terms of the classical variables associated to each particle .",
    "the atomic principle has been used here to restrict , among the possible interaction lagrangians , those which do not modify the spin structure of any of the classical spinning particles .    to see if the classical lagrangian ( [ eq : intl ] ) describes something equivalent to the quantum mechanical interaction lagrangian of the dirac field with the intermediate gauge field we have to proof that our classical lagrangian can be rewritten , for instance , in the form of a coupling of each particle current with the retarded classical electromagnetic potential of the other , i.e. , @xmath121 or something alike .",
    "however , this lagrangian describes an action at a distance interaction between particles in the form of a coupling of the particles four - velocities @xmath122 and in terms of their spacetime separation @xmath123 , but not in terms of the retarded spacetime positions so that , if the above decomposition could be achieved , the lagrangian could be interpreted as the predictivization of the retarded electromagnetic interaction between the two particles .",
    "this task is , probably , cumbersome and out of the scope of the present section which tries to enhance the role of the atomic principle in restricting the allowed interactions .",
    "it poses an interesting research subject for future work .",
    "but , nevertheless , the present lagrangian contains as a limit , when the spins of the particles are supressed , the instantaneous coulomb interaction between the two point charges , which is a nice and expected non - relativistic and spinless limit .",
    "if we succeed in showing this feature it would mean some relationship between the quantum local gauge invariance statement and the atomic principle because they lead , in the quantum and classical framework , respectively , to a similar interaction description .",
    "it is an interesting theoretical ansatz .",
    "the formalism produces several predictions :    * chirality .",
    "matter is lefthanded and antimatter righthanded . *",
    "particles and antiparticles have the same relative orientation between the spin and magnetic moment .",
    "* a repulsive force betweeen charges does not forbid the formation of bound states , provided the spins are parallel .        the conserved kinematical momentum , i.e. , the constant of the motion associated to the invariance of the lagrangian under lorentz boosts , takes the form for a dirac free particle @xmath124 in the centre - of - mass frame @xmath125 and @xmath126 , and dirac s spin @xmath67 is a constant vector , so that the motion of the charge is given by @xmath127 and these two motions are depicted , respectively , in figure 3(a ) and 3(b ) , where we have chosen for the particle the charge @xmath128 and for the antiparticle @xmath129 .",
    "there is an arbitrariness in the selection of the charge of the particle , but the motion of the positive energy solution is clockwise , once the spin direction is fixed , while for the antiparticle we have a counterclockwise motion , although both motions produce the same spin .",
    "then , the particle makes a negative trajectory in the zitterbewegung plane , thus representing a left - handed system .",
    "antimatter moves according to a right - handed system .",
    "this produces that particle and antiparticle have the same magnetic dipole with the same relative orientation with respect to the spin .",
    "they also have an instantaneous electric dipole which rotates very fast around the spin direction , so that its time average is basically zero for low energy proccesses .",
    "the electron , as an average , can thus be considered as a point charge at rest and some magnetic dipole , located both at the centre - of - mass .",
    "but in very close electron - electron interaction or in high energy processes , both electric and magnetic dipoles have to be taken into account for describing the interaction , or , alternatively , the knowledge of the actual location of the corresponding charges .    as a matter of fact , the positronium ( electron - positron bound sytem ) has a ground state of spin 0 and magnetic moment 0 .",
    "this means that the spins of both electron and positron are antiparallel to each other and the same thing happens to the corresponding magnetic moments .",
    "therefore , for the electron and positron there would exist the same relative orientation between the spin and magnetic moment .",
    "the neutral pion @xmath130 is a linear combination of the quark - antiquark bound systems @xmath131 , @xmath132 and sometimes the pair @xmath133 is also included .",
    "it is a system of 0 spin and 0 magnetic moment . because each of the above quarks have different masses and charges , and thus different magnetic moments ,",
    "the possibility is that each quark - antiquark pair is a system of 0 spin and 0 magnetic moment , and , therefore each quark and the corresponding antiquark must have the same relative orientation between the spin and magnetic moment .",
    "this feature is opposite to what is usually assumed because for the electron it is taken that spin and magnetic moment are opposite to each other , while for the positron they are taken parallel .",
    "however , in my opinion , there is no clear experimental evidence in the literature of this fact and , therefore , experimentalists should check at least , for electrons and muons , whether they have the spin and magnetic moments parallel or antiparallel .",
    "one possibility is to analize the motion of these particles in storage rings .",
    "if , as predicted , they have the same relative orientation , then when injecting in the same direction , @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( or muons either ) , polarized in the up direction , their spins must preccess in the opposite direction , because the magnetic field has to be reversed when we change from particles to antiparticles .",
    "the direction of preccession will show whether they are parallel or antiparallel .    if we analyse the interaction of two dirac particles we can use the mentioned interaction lagrangian ( [ eq : li ] ) which is invariant under the enlarged @xmath88 group .",
    "when the two particles are far apart , the behaviour of the interaction becomes the instantaneous coulomb interaction between the charges . in figure 4",
    "we represent the sccatering of two electrons with the spins parallel and where the trajectories of the corresponding centres - of - mass are also depicted . in this example",
    "the two particles approach each other to a separation greater than compton s wavelength .",
    "but if we locate very closely the two electrons , below compton s wavelength , provided the phases of the charges in the internal motion are opposite to each other , and the velocities below @xmath136 , we can obtain metastable bound motions like the one depicted in figure 5 . the mass of this spin 1 bound system is greater than @xmath137 , because the potential and kinetic energies are both positive .",
    "the solution of the corresponding quantum analysis , in particular the possible quantization of the binding energies , is not yet done .",
    "the analysis of this bound motion has been done in @xcite .        to justify how two particles of the same charge can attract each other",
    ", we have to solve a system of fourth order differential equations for each particle or , alternatively , a system of second order differential equations once the centers - of - mass of the particles are defined . for each centre - of - mass trajectory",
    "we need to know the external force acting on the corresponding particle , but this force is defined at the corresponding centre - of - charge , and as we see in figure 6        a repulsive force between the charges implies an attractive force between the centres - of - mass provided the phases of the charges are opposite to each other .",
    "in a schematic form we list briefly some general features and conclusions about the kinematical formalism , obtained by assuming the atomic hypothesis as a fundamental principle .    *",
    "an elementary particle is a system without excited states .",
    "if it is not destroyed , its internal structure can never be modified .",
    "all its possible states are kinematical modifications of any one of them . *",
    "the most general trajectory of the charge of a free elementary spinning particle is a helix at the speed of light . *",
    "the kinematical group supplies the symmetries and the variables for the variational description of an elementary particle , wich necessarily span a homogeneous space of the group . *",
    "these classical variables define the support manifold of the hilbert space when quantizing the system . *",
    "the kinematical formalism is complete in the sense that the quantization of the models produces all known one - particle wave - equations . *",
    "the spinning particles are localized and orientable systems . *",
    "the center - of - charge and center - of - mass are necessarily different points . *",
    "elementary dirac particles have a definite chirality .",
    "matter is left - handed and antimatter right - handed . *",
    "the spin has a twofold structure : one part is related the orbital motion of the center - of - charge and the other is related to the rotation of the particle .",
    "* this twofold structure produces a kinematical interpretation of the gyromagnetic ratio . * the magnetic moment is produced by the motion of the center - of - charge around the center - of - mass ( zitterbewegung ) . *",
    "a particle and its corresponding antiparticle have the same relative orientation between the spin and magnetic moment . *",
    "the spacetime symmetry group of a dirac particle is larger than the poincar group .",
    "it becomes , at least , @xmath88 .",
    "* it is the spin the only intrinsic property of a dirac particle if considered under this kinematical group .",
    "* two equal charged particles can form , from the classical point of view , bound systems provided their spins are parallel and if their separation is below compton s wavelength .",
