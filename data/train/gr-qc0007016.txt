    "one of the most important solutions of einstein s equation is that of the spacetime around and inside an isolated black hole .",
    "the spacetime at a large distance is flat and minkowskian where usual quantum mechanics is applicable , while the spacetime closer to the singularity is so curved that no satisfactory quantum field theory could be developed as yet .",
    "an intermediate situation arises when a weak perturbation ( due to , say , gravitational , electromagnetic or dirac waves ) originating from infinity impinges on a black hole , interacting with it .",
    "the resulting wave is partially transmitted into the black hole through the horizon and partially scatters off to infinity . in the linearized ( ` test field ' ) approximation this problem has been attacked in the past by several authors [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "the master equations of teukolsky [ 2 ] which govern these linear perturbations for integral spin ( e.g. , gravitational and electromagnetic ) fields were solved numerically by press & teukolsky [ 5 ] and teukolsky & press [ 6 ] . while the equations governing the massive dirac particles were separated by chandrasekhar [ 3 ] .",
    "so far , only the angular eigenfunction and eigenvalue ( which happens to be the separation constant ) have been obtained [ 7 ] .",
    "particularly interesting is the fact that whereas gravitational and electromagnetic radiations were found to be amplified in some range of incoming frequencies , chandrasekhar [ 4 ] predicted that no such amplifications should take place for dirac waves because of the very nature of the potential experienced by the incoming fields .",
    "however , these later conclusions were drawn using asymptotic solutions and no attempt has so far been made to determine the nature of the radial wave functions , both incoming and outgoing , for the dirac wave perturbations .",
    "he also speculated that one needs to look into the problem for negative eigenvalues ( @xmath0 ) where one _ might _ come across super - radiance for dirac waves .    in the present paper",
    ", we revisit this important problem to study the nature of the radial wave functions as a function of the kerr parameter , rest mass and frequency of incoming particle .",
    "we also verify that super - radiance is indeed absent for the dirac field .",
    "unlike the works of press & teukolsky [ 5 ] and teukolsky & press [ 6 ] where numerical ( shooting ) methods were used to solve the master equations governing gravitational and electromagnetic waves , we use an approximate analytical method for the massive dirac wave .",
    "the details of the method would be presented below .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we present the equation governing the dirac waves ( waves for half - integral massive spin particles ) as they were separated into radial and angular co - ordinates .",
    "we then briefly present the nature of the angular eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . in  3 ,",

    "clearly these reflection and transmission coefficients at different junctions will be different .",
    "this is discussed in detail below . to be concrete , we choose one set of parameters from region i. here , the total energy of the incoming particle is greater than the potential barrier height for all values of @xmath108 .",

    "2c , the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients are shown .",
    "it is seen that as matter comes close to the black hole , the barrier height goes down . as a result , the penetration probability increases , causing the rise of the transmission coefficient .",
    "local values of the reflection and transmission co - efficients could also be calculated using the well known quantum mechanical approach .",

    "it is to be noted , that , strictly speaking , the terms ` reflection ' and ` transmission ' coefficients are traditionally defined with respect to the asymptotic values . the spatial dependence that we show are just the dependence of the instantaneous values",

    "the wkb approximation ( more precisely iwkb approximation ) method is valid from infinity to @xmath262 since , otherwise , @xmath263 is not satisfied . in those other regions one has to apply a different method ( which was also explained in last sub - section ) to find solutions .",
    "the local values of the reflection and transmission coefficients and the wave function of the particle are calculated as in the previous cases . since the matter which tunnels through the infinitely high barrier face infinitely strong attractive field",
    ", the possibility of extraction of energy would be zero . in fig .",
    "6c , the variations of local transmission and reflection coefficients are shown .",
    "the net transmission of the wave through the horizon is non - negative all along and therefore super - radiation is absent , although @xmath16 is less than @xmath222 .",
    "we believe that the non - existence of super - radiation is due to ( @xmath264 variation of the potential near the singular point . because of the existence of attractive field , the extraction of energy is difficult , so the net transmission of the wave through the horizon from @xmath265 is always positive .",
    "this argument is valid for any set of parameters where @xmath266 .",
    "in this paper , we studied scattering of massive , spin - half particles from a kerr black hole , particularly the nature of the radial wave functions and the reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "our main motivation was to give a general analytical expression of the solution which can be useful for further study .",
    "we showed few illustrative cases as examples .",
    "we verified that these analytical solutions were indeed correct by explicitly solving the same set of equations using quantum mechanical step - potential approach as described in section iii .",
    "we classified the entire parameter space in terms of the physical and unphysical regions and the physical region was further classified into two regions , depending on whether the particle ` hits ' the potential barrier or not .",
    "again , the region where particle hits on the barrier , is divided into two parts , one is super - radiant region and other is non - super - radiant region .",
    "we chose one illustrative example in each of the regions . we emphasize that the most ` interesting ' region to study would be close to @xmath267 .",
    "however we pointed out ( fig .",
    "1 ) that for @xmath268 , the wkb solutions can not be trusted , and other methods ( such as those using airy functions ) must be employed .    we used the well known wkb approximation method as well as the step - potential method of quantum mechanics to obtain the spatial dependence of the coefficients of the wave function . this in turn , allowed us to determine the reflection and transmission coefficients and the nature of wave functions",
    "the usual wkb method with constant coefficients and ( almost ) constant wave number @xmath99 is successfully applied even when the coefficients and wave number are not constant everywhere .",
    "solution from this ` instantaneous ' wkb ( or iwkb ) method agrees fully with that obtained from a purely quantum mechanical method where the potential is replaced by a collection of steps .",
    "our method of obtaining solutions should be valid for any black hole geometry which are asymptotically flat so that radial waves could be used at a large distance . this way we ensure that the analytical solution is close to the exact solution . in region",
    "ii , in some regions , the wkb method can not be applied and hence airy function approach or our step - potential approach could be used .    in the literature , reflection and",
    "transmission coefficients are defined at a single point .",
    "these definitions are meaningful only if the potential varies in a small region while studies are made from a large distance from it . in the present case ,",
    "the potential changes over a large distance and we are studying in these regions as well . although we used the words ` reflection ' and ` transmission ' coefficients , in this paper very loosely , our definitions are very rigorous and well defined .",
    "these quantities are simply the instantaneous values and in our belief more physical .",
    "the problem at hand is very similar to the problem of reflection and transmission of acoustic waves from a strucked string of non - constant density where reflection and transmission occurs at each point .    among other things , we verify chandrasekhar s conjecture [ 4 ] based on the asymptotic solution , that for spin-@xmath269 particle the phenomenon of super - radiance",
    "is absent .",
    "we believe that this is due to the very way the potential develops the singularity at @xmath248 . here",
    "@xmath270 , which results in an attractive potential in some region very close to the black hole .",
    "in contrast , @xmath271 when electromagnetic and gravitational waves are scattered off the black hole [ 4 ] does not create an attractive part in the potential and possibly exhibit the phenomenon of super - radiance .",
    "it is noted that all the cases where potential diverge at @xmath272 ( i.e. , so called super - radiation cases ) arise for @xmath81 with the negative values of azimuthal quantum number ( here , @xmath273 ) and the positive kerr parameter , @xmath14 . for positive values of @xmath19 and positive values of @xmath14",
    ", potential does not diverge at any point for all values of @xmath16 .",
    "if we change the spin orientation of the black hole ( negative values of @xmath14 ) and take positive @xmath19 again divergence of the potential will arise .",
    "thus , it seems that the cases with opposite sign of @xmath14 and @xmath19 are physically more interesting .",
    "it is seen that for different physical parameters the solutions are different .",
    "the waves scattered off are distinctly different in different parameter regions . in a way , therefore , black holes can act as a mass spectrograph ! another interesting application of our method would be to study interactions of hawking radiations in regions just outside the horizon .",
