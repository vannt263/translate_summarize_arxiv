    "the evolution of pbhs in jbd cosmology has however remained unexplored in the literature .",
    "since jbd models entail modification of the standard cosmological evolution , it is expected that the evolution of pbhs in jbd models and their associated consequences on various cosmological processes could be substantially modified compared to the case of standard cosmology .",
    "the purpose of this work is to perform a preliminary study of the evolution of pbhs in jbd cosmology .",
    "we consider a generalized scalar tensor theory @xcite where the coupling parameter @xmath2 is a function of the scalar field @xmath3 , and is thus also time - dependent .",
    "we use a set of power - law solutions for the scale factor , the jbd field and the coupling @xmath0 obtained in the radiation era @xcite , and investigate the net energy flux for the pbhs resulting from the processes of hawking evaporation and the acretion of radiation .",
    "we show that accretion of radiation can be effective in the radiation dominated era since the growth of pbhs is always subdominant to the growth of the cosmological horizon in this jbd model . in the matter dominated era , the dynamics of the pbhs is solely governed by the evaporation process whose rate is determined by another set of power - law solutions of this jbd model in the matter dominated era @xcite .",
    "the lifetime for pbhs are obtained in terms of their initial masses .",
    "our results outline a viable scenario for the growth and survival of pbhs as constituents of dark matter in jbd cosmology .",
    "we begin with a generalized jbd action given by s = d^4x [ r - ( _ ) ^2 ] + s _ [ action ] where the strength of the running gravitational coupling is given by the inverse of @xmath3 , i.e. , at any time @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 corresponds to the action of the relativistic fluid of particles ( @xmath7 ) in the flat ( @xmath8 ) frw early universe with scale factor @xmath9 . the friedman equation and the equation of motion for the jbd field @xmath3 obtained from the above action",
    "are given respectively by + - = [ fe ] and + 3 = - [ eqmotion ] with the energy conservation equation given by + 3(+ p ) = 0 [ enconv ] for a radiation dominated evolution , one has @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . assuming power law solutions for the scale factor @xmath12 , the jbd field @xmath13 , and also the coupling parameter @xmath14 one can obtain @xcite the following time - dependences of these quantities : a(t ) = a_i()^ [ rdsoln1 ] ( t ) = _ i()^- [ rdsoln2 ] 2(t)+ 3 = ( 2_i + 3)()^ [ rdsoln3 ] where the subscript @xmath15 indicates the initial values of the variables . in order to minimize the departure of the evolution of the scale factor from the case of the radiation dominated evolution of standard cosmology ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) we choose @xmath17 . without loss of generality , we set @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the planck mass ( corresponding to the present value of @xmath20 ) .",
    "note that the solution for the jbd field @xmath3 indicates the strengthening of gravity with the increase of cosmic time .",
    "such a behaviour for @xmath3 arises not just from the specific model ( [ action ] ) used here , but is a rather generic feature of several generalized jbd or scalar tensor models with a potential for the scalar field which rolls down the slope leading to the increase of @xmath20 with time @xcite .",
    "primordial black holes could form due to various mechanisms @xcite some of which have been studied in detail in the literature @xcite .",
    "the gravitational collapse of perturbations within the cosmological horizon could lead to sub - horizon sized black hole formation after jeans crossing .",
    "such a mechanism may not be very effective however , in jbd cosmology where the jeans length itself could be significantly increased due to the weakening of gravity in certain models by a large value of the jbd field in the early universe .",
    "nevertheless , a strong ( first order ) inflationary phase transition in extended inflation models driven by the jbd field @xcite naturally leads to unnucleated and trapped false vacuum regions and topological defects such as domain walls and wormholes that could easily collapse into black holes , and could also create super - horizon density perturbations .",
    "the formation of super - horizon scale pbhs in the expanding frw background has been studied recently @xcite . in the present analysis",
    "we will not take recourse to any particular formation mechanism for pbhs , but rather study their cosmological evolution in jbd theory , assuming that there exist pbhs in such scenarios .",
    "we now consider the evolution of pbhs in the cosmological background governed by the above solutions ( [ rdsoln1]),([rdsoln2 ] ) and ( [ rdsoln3 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the pbh density is low enough to ensure radiation domination . for a pbh immersed in the radiation field",
    ", the accretion of radiation leads to the increase of its mass with the rate given by _",
    "acc = 4f r_bh^2_r [ accr1 ] where @xmath21 is the black hole radius , and @xmath22 is the accretion efficiency . using the solution for @xmath3 given by eq.([rdsoln2 ] ) with the assumption of @xmath17 , and using @xmath23 $ ]",
    ", one obtains _",
    "acc = [ accr2 ] where @xmath24 .",
    "eq.([accr2 ] ) is integrated to yield = [ accr3 ] with @xmath25 being the initial mass of the pbh at time @xmath26 . since the logarithmic growth rate for a pbh given by eq.([accr3 ] ) is subdominant to the linear growth of the horizon mass @xmath27 ( since @xmath28 ) , once a pbh is formed , it is indeed possible for it to grow in size by accreting the radiation energy within its cosmological horizon .    for a complete picture of pbh evolution",
    ", one needs also to consider the hawking evaporation process , whose rate is given by _",
    "evap = - 4 g r_bh^2 t^4 [ evap1 ] where @xmath29 is the hawking temperature , @xmath30 the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath31 is the effective number of degrees of freedom of the particles emitted by the black hole .",
    "the solution for @xmath3 given by eq.([rdsoln2 ] ) leads to _ evap = - [ evap2 ] where @xmath32 . the complete evolution for the pbh is thus described by the combination of eqs.([accr2 ] ) and ( [ evap2 ] ) : = - + [ bheq ] it is apparent from eq.([bheq ] ) that for pbhs with initial mass @xmath33 , the rate of evaporation exceeds that of accretion .",
    "for such a case , accretion soon becomes negligible and black holes lose energy at a rate given effectively by eq.([evap2 ] ) .",
    "note that though the rate of evaporation decreases with time , it is still higher than the corresponding rate in standard cosmology .",
    "this is because the hawking temperature @xmath29 is larger for jbd pbhs for large @xmath3 .",
    "hence , a pbh with initial mass @xmath34 evaporates out much quicker , with a lifetime @xmath35 given by = [ lifetime1 ] however , pbhs with initial mass @xmath36 experience monotonic growth with accretion dominating over evaporation throughout the period of validity of eq.([bheq ] ) , i.e. , throughout the radiation dominated era .",
    "eq.([bheq ] ) can be integrated exactly and leads to the following mass - time relationship for the pbhs : ( ) & = & + & + & [ bhsol1 ] with @xmath37 .",
    "accretion of radiation can proceed effectively till the universe stays radiation dominated , i.e. , up to the era of matter radiation equality @xmath38 .",
    "this result is qualitatively different from the widely accepted picture in the standard cosmological evolution where accretion of radiation in the radiation dominated era seems to be ineffective @xcite .",
    "the domination of accretion over evaporation is observed also in other modified gravity theories , such as in the braneworld scenario @xcite .",
    "the maximum mass achieved by a pbh of initial mass @xmath25 is given by [ maxmass ]    in the matter dominated era , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "a set of solutions for the jbd cosmological equations ( [ fe ] ) , ( [ eqmotion ] ) and ( [ enconv ] ) is given by @xcite a(t ) = a(t_eq)()^ [ mdsoln1 ] ( t ) = ( t_eq)()^- [ mdsoln2 ] ( t ) = -(t_eq)()^ [ mdsoln3 ] matching these solutions with those obtained in the radiation dominated era given by eqs.([rdsoln1]),([rdsoln2 ] ) and ( [ rdsoln3 ] ) , one has @xmath41 and @xmath42 . substituting the solution for the jbd field @xmath3 in eq.([evap1 ] )",
    "leads to the following evaporation law for pbhs in the matter dominated era : = - [ mdevap1 ] with @xmath43 .",
    "the mass of the pbhs evolve as m(t ) = m_max^1/3 [ bhsolmd ] in the matter dominated era .",
    "the lifetime for the pbhs @xmath35 is given by t_evap = t_eq^-3/5 [ lifetime20 ] which upon ( using eq.([maxmass ] ) ) reduces to t_evap = t_eq^-3/5 [ lifetime2 ] since the availability of background radiation diminishes substantially in the matter dominated era , one can safely neglect any accretion term corresponding to the accretion of radiation by the pbhs .",
    "however , other forms of accretion such as of the energy of a quintessence field could , in principle , be effective @xcite , that we do not consider in the present analysis .",
    "the rate of evaporation is again faster , as in the radiation dominated era , than in the case of standard cosmology ( where @xmath44 ) .",
    "however , the rate decreases with time as is evident from the r.h.s of eq.([mdevap1 ] ) whose counterpart in the standard theory is independent of time .",
    "the overall lifetime of a jbd pbh has an interesting comparison to a pbh lifetime in standard cosmology .",
    "a jbd pbh with initial mass @xmath34 , evaporates out quicker than a pbh in standard cosmology , being unable to accrete in the radiation dominated era .",
    "however , when the initial mass exceeds @xmath45 , accretion proceeds effectively and dominates over evaporation in the radiation dominated era increasing the pbh mass at the time of matter - radiation equality . in the matter dominated era , though the evaporation rate of jbd pbh is faster , it starts to evaporate out much later than in standard cosmology ( without accretion ) .",
    "thus , the lifetime for a pbh with @xmath36 is enhanced in the jbd scenario compared to the case of standard cosmology .",
    "note that in the present analysis we have not considered any possible back reaction of the pbhs on the local background value of the jbd field resulting from the local change of energy density @xmath46 due to the pbhs .",
    "the form of the jbd field equation ( [ eqmotion ] ) is such that the @xmath46-dependence drops out in the radiation dominated era .",
    "further , in the late matter - dominated era the value of @xmath0 is large enough ( in order to satisfy present observational bounds ) such that the @xmath46-dependent term again becomes negligible in eq.([eqmotion ] ) .",
    "so any back reaction could be effective only in the early matter dominated epoch during which a local rise in energy density could result in a slower rate of decrease for the @xmath3 field near the pbhs than what is obtained in eq.([mdsoln2 ] ) . the resultant change in the pbh evaporation law ( [ mdevap1 ] )",
    "could introduce a minor correction to the pbh lifetime ( [ lifetime2 ] ) that we have neglected here .",
    "it would be interesting to observe particular examples of evolving pbhs in jbd cosmology .",
    "note that the accretion and evaporation rates depend on the initial value @xmath3 of the jbd field through the quantities @xmath47 and @xmath48 defined earlier . here",
    "we fix the value of @xmath49 or @xmath50 by setting the present value of @xmath51 ( corresponding to the present strength of gravity ) and evolving @xmath3 given by eqs.([mdsoln2 ] ) and ( [ rdsoln2 ] ) corresponding to the matter and radiation dominated eras , respectively , backwards in time .",
    "we thus obtain the value of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes the electroweak era since which the jbd evolution equations ( [ eqmotion ] ) are assumed to be valid . from eq.([lifetime1 ] ) it follows that for a pbh with @xmath34 to survive the radiation dominated era , @xmath54 . a pbh which forms at time @xmath53 with an initial mass of the order of the cosmological horizon mass at @xmath53",
    "satisfies the condition @xmath36 , and accretes radiation .",
    "though the actual growth of mass turns out to be negligible for such a pbh , accretion does play an important role enabling it to survive for much longer ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "another interesting consequence of eq.([lifetime2 ] ) is that for a pbh to evaporate during the present era , i.e. , @xmath56 one needs to have @xmath57 .",
    "since accretion can not cause significant growth , one requires @xmath58 .",
    "however , a pbh with such a small initial mass can not even survive the radiation dominated era . only those pbhs which have @xmath59 enter the matter dominated era and these also survive up to the present era , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "thus there are no end products of black hole evaporation to contend with in jbd cosmology during the matter dominated era and beyond up to present times .",
    "all pbhs with initial mass @xmath61 evaporate out in the radiation dominated era itself . on the other hand , pbhs with larger",
    "mass can survive as intermediate mass astrophysical black holes contributing to the dark matter density .",
    "to summarize , in this letter we have studied the evolution of pbhs in jbd cosmology and obtained a cut - off value for the initial mass which decides whether the pbhs could survive up to today .",
    "an interesting consequence of our analysis is that no pbhs evaporate during the matter dominated era , and hence there is no distortion of the cosmic microwave background radiation spectrum due to evaporating pbhs .",
    "though our results are in the context of a particular jbd model , the sort of evolution obtained for the jbd field @xmath3 is generic to other jbd models as well , in particular those following from higher dimensional theories @xcite . in order to satisfy solar system constraints @xcite such as the one recently obtained through the frequency shift of radio photons to and from the cassini spacecraft as they passed near the sun @xcite , one requires @xmath62 , which using eqs .",
    "( [ mdsoln3 ] ) and ( [ rdsoln3 ] ) , leads to @xmath63 , thus strongly validating our approximation of @xmath17 used to derive the black hole evolution equation in the radiation dominated era . with the possibility of future observations of actually finding or ruling out jbd models by determining @xmath0 @xcite , it would indeed be exciting to re - work the standard observational constraints @xcite on the density of pbhs at several cosmological eras in the jbd scenario . in particular",
    ", the faster evaporation of smaller pbhs in the radiation dominated era could impose tighter constraints on the initial mass spectrum from nucleosynthesis bounds @xcite .",
    "investigation of these issues calls for a more comprehensive analysis by considering a population of black holes in the early universe evolving according to the jbd dynamics ."
