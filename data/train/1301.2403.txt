    "the stick - slip is often believed to be associated either with a lubricant melting - freezing mechanism , where the film disorders and melts at slip and solidifies during the stick phase ( see @xcite and references therein ) , or else with a layer - on - layer shear ( a shear band ) within the film bulk or at the film - wall interface  @xcite .        moreover , as lubricant layers get successively squeezed out under increasing pressure , each @xmath0 ( `` relayering '' ) transition generally corresponds to an upward friction jump  @xcite . virtually everywhere in sliding friction , including the smoothest boundary lubricated systems",
    ", friction grows with load .",
    "the question which we raise here is whether , and under which circumstances , that friction jump could be _ downward _ rather than upward at relayering .",
    "the relative surface structure properties at the interface between sliders and confined film may play the key role . under pressure the crystal - like lubricant ordering perpendicular to the interface",
    "will typically be accompanied by ordering parallel to the interface  @xcite .",
    "however , little is known about possible two - dimensional ( 2d ) parallel crystalline order , and even less about its changes upon high pressure relayering .",
    "there is some evidence , for example in molecular squeezout simulations  @xcite indicating crystalline parallel ordering of the narrowly confined lubricant , and its dependence on the load .",
    "that detail is important for the case of crystalline sliders , for in general the frictional forces will depend on the relative geometry and commensurability at the slider - lubricant interfaces , in a way which is not immediately predictable , in particular not automatically monotonic with pressure . to explore the variety of possibilities",
    ", we decided to abandon the open geometry where lubricant squeezout takes place , surely much faster with sliding than without  @xcite , and we simulated instead lubricated sliding friction under sealed conditions , with constant particle number and no squeezout .",
    "sealed conditions might be locally realized in some real cases , but we use them here essentially as a theoretical device .",
    "our results show that in agreement with pressure - induced @xmath1 relayering of the solidified confined lubricant film , the parallel lubricant periodicity also changes ; and as a result the lubricated sliding friction may indeed switch from stick - slip , accompanied by bulk shear with or without melting - freezing , to smooth sliding regimes typical of incommensurate interfaces exhibiting superlubric dry friction . in that case",

    "for each configuration , we evaluated the static friction threshold by driving the top wall external spring at a very small velocity ( i.e. , 100 times smaller than that previously adopted ) and measuring the height of the peak preceding the first slip .",
    "figure  [ figura8 ] shows a clear onset of static friction near @xmath73 , taking place without any change in the incommensurate slider - lubricant registry .",
    "this represents an example of the well - known `` aubry transition ''  @xcite in one - dimensional systems , where the increasing interaction between a harmonic sliding chain and an incommensurate periodic potential gives rise to dynamic pinning with the onset of static friction .",
    "the sliding trajectories ( fig .",
    "[ figura8 ] ) correspondingly switch from smooth sliding to stick - slip of strength increasing with load .",

    "@xcite , the critical pressure for the @xmath50 relayering is about @xmath74 kbar .",
    "that seems too high compared with ordinary squeezing loads in surface force apparatus , although local trapping of sealed lubricant `` puddles '' might still take place at inhomogeneous interfaces  @xcite .",
    "mesoscopic systems appear more promising .",
    "for example , colloids can be confined in layers , crystallized due to their soft screened colomb repulsion , and also driven to slide against laser generated periodic potentials  @xcite .",
    "they might therefore represent a good trial case for a study relayering of high pressure frictional drops .",
    "in summary we have explored , by simulating lubricated sliding under sealed conditions , the possibility that frictional jumps associated with @xmath1 relayering transitions might be downward rather than upward as commonly observed .",
    "we find that downward jumps may occur due to two factors : ( i ) high friction with internal shear , easier at low pressure and low density , could disappear after relayering , when density is higher ; ( ii ) the change of interface commensurability entails possible superlubricity at higher pressure . in experiments",
    "so far , the friction drop just described is likely removed by lubricant squeezout , and routes should be considered to overcome that . despite a clear difficulty in realizing sealed sliding configurations in ordinary materials and sliding geometries",
    ", these two elements stand as results of general importance , given the relevance of any elements that could control , and especially decrease , friction . under the more common open boundary conditions of boundary lubrication , where relayering also takes place ,",
    "one still could , depending on conditions and materials , realize one or both points above . in realistic inhomogeneous conditions ,",
    "moreover , lubricant `` puddles '' might become sealed under pressure  @xcite , and their sudden yielding could be important for the local sliding dynamics . finally , future developments of artificial sliding colloidal systems  @xcite might permit soon the realization of sealed sliding , and the verification of our results , including , in addition to the downward jumps , pressure induced aubry transitions .",
