    "gershgorin s circle theorem @xcite is a fundamental and widely used result on localizing the eigenvalues of square matrices .",
    "it states that all eigenvalues are in disks ( called gershgorin disks ) around the diagonal elements .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to improve gershgorin s theorem under special conditions , namely , when the matrix is non - negative and has a multiple eigenvalue .",
    "we show that such an eigenvalue lies in disks of smaller radius around a diagonal element . for the proof",
    "we establish various geometric inequalities concerning rearrangements of vector sums .",
    "this is an interesting connection between convex geometry and matrix theory .",
    "the geometric point of view in eigenvalue problems is certainly not new but this particular connection seems to be new .",
    "here we show that if the matrix entries are non - negative and an eigenvalue has geometric multiplicity at least two , then this eigenvalue lies in a smaller disk .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the disk with center @xmath1 and radius @xmath2 on the complex plane :    @xmath3    for an @xmath4 complex matrix , @xmath5,$ ] the gershgorin disks are @xmath6 where @xmath7 the most commonly cited form of gershgorin s theorem says that every eigenvalue of @xmath8 lies in some @xmath6 .",

    "@xcite surveys various applications and extensions of this important theorem .",
    "an interesting and recent theorem of marsli and hall @xcite states that if an eigenvalue of a matrix @xmath8 has geometric multiplicity @xmath9 then it lies in at least @xmath10 of the gershgorin disks of @xmath11 they have extended this result in subsequent papers @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the @xmath12 case for non - negative matrices .    understanding the spectra of a matrix is a central question both in applied and pure mathematics . here",
    "are some facts and results .",
    "there are two particular eigenvalues for which the multiplicity is of great importance ; the largest eigenvalue which determines the spectral radius of the matrix and the multiplicity of the eigenvalue `` 0 '' since it determines the rank of the matrix .",
    "there are also applications using the smallest eigenvalue . for example",
    "roy shows in @xcite that the euclidean representation number of a graph is closely related to the multiplicity of the smallest eigenvalue .",
    "the multiplicity of the largest and the second largest eigenvalues play a key role in some numerical methods .",
    "del corso @xcite considers the problem of approximating an eigenvector belonging to the largest eigenvalue by the so called power method .",
    "it is proved that the rate of convergence depends on the ratio of the two largest eigenvalues and on their multiplicities .",
    "the rate increases with the multiplicity of the largest eigenvalue and decreases with the multiplicity of the second eigenvalue . in graph theory the colin de verdire number is the multiplicity of the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix , maximized by weighting the edges and nodes . for more details and the exact definition",
    "we refer to the papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "gershgorin s circle theorem is intertwined with the perron - frobenius theory .",
    "it is one of the tools used to bound the spectral radius of a matrix .",
    "it follows from the perron - frobenius theorem that the largest magnitude eigenvalue of any non - negative matrix is a positive real number , see in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "let us define the _ half gershgorin _",
    "disks , @xmath13 which are subsets of the original . instead of @xmath14",
    "we take the partial sum of the @xmath15 largest terms .",
    "this sum is denoted by @xmath16 .",

    "indeed , let @xmath77 and @xmath88 be two linearly independent eigenvectors from the eigenspace of @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath89 , then @xmath90 is a suitable eigenvector . if not , then @xmath91 has the required property .    as any multiplier of @xmath92 is still an eigenvector",

    "then the other components , @xmath95 , are complex numbers with @xmath96 .",
    "the * proof * of theorem  [ th : halfg ] is based on equation ( [ eq : basic ] ) plus the condition that @xmath97 . as @xmath98 is a vector space of dimension 2 over @xmath99",
    ", we can consider the components @xmath95 of @xmath92 as vectors in @xmath100 .",
    "then theorem  [ th : first ] with @xmath101 applies to the @xmath102 , we just have to imagine that on the right hand side of ( [ eq : basic ] ) @xmath33 is added with coefficient zero .",
    "so define @xmath103 and @xmath104 if @xmath105 .",
    "let @xmath106 be the median of the sequence @xmath107 .",
    "theorem  [ th : first ] gives then that @xmath17 lies in the disk @xmath22 where @xmath108    the proof of theorem  [ th : halfg ] uses corollary  [ cor : first ] : @xmath17 lies in the disk @xmath22 where @xmath2 is the sum of the largest @xmath109 entries in the @xmath23th row of @xmath8 ( disregarding @xmath110 .",

    "@xmath52    we can also apply corollary [ cor : second ] to the components of @xmath92 , considered again as vectors in @xmath100 .",
    "this gives that @xmath111 lies in the disk @xmath22 where @xmath2 is the sum of the @xmath112 largest entries in row @xmath23 of @xmath8 ( disregarding @xmath113 again ) .",
    "in any special case a better estimate may come from the more general theorem  [ th : second ] .",
    "one could hope that an eigenvalue with ( geometric ) multiplicity 3 or higher should lie strictly inside the half gershgorin disk .",
    "the simple example below shows that this is not the case .",
    "let @xmath8 be an @xmath4 matrix with @xmath114 , consisting of three @xmath115 blocks along the main diagonal , with each block being a doubly stochastic matrix .",
    "then @xmath116 is an eigenvalue with multiplicity 3 , which lies on the boundary of each half gershgorin disk @xmath117 .",
    "indeed @xmath16 is the sum of the largest @xmath109 entries of the @xmath23th row ( disregarding @xmath113 ) which equals @xmath118 .",
    "this example shows , however , that @xmath17 lies in the `` third gershgorin disk '' .",
    "this is the disk centred at @xmath113 and of radius @xmath2 which is the sum of the largest @xmath119 entries in the @xmath23th row ( disregarding again @xmath113 ) .",
    "we return to this question at the end of the paper .",
    "in what follows we show examples illustrating the limits of possible extensions of the results above .",
    "note that one can not expect in general that a multiple eigenvalue is strictly inside the half gershgorin disk .",
    "the simplest illustration to this is the matrix @xmath8 below where @xmath120 is an eigenvalue with ( geometric ) multiplicity two .",
    "@xmath121\\ ] ]    next we are going to give further examples .",
    "the first two show that theorem  [ th : halfg ] does not extend to real matrices that have both positive and negative entries .",
    "the second is a positive semidefinite hermitian matrix ( with complex entries ) where the triple eigenvalue `` 0 '' lies on the boundary of the half gershgorin disk .",
    "perhaps some form of theorem  [ th : halfg ] can be extended to such matrices .",
    "the matrices in theorem  [ th : halfg ] have non - negative entries",
    ". this condition can not be deleted as the following symmetric circulant matrix with @xmath122 entries shows : @xmath123\\ ] ] like every @xmath124 symmetric circulant matrix , @xmath61 has two multiple eigenvalues .",
    "they are @xmath125 and @xmath126 and both lie outside the half gershgorin disk .",
    "the following @xmath127 matrix is again circulant and has @xmath122 entries .",
    "its multiple eigenvalue @xmath128 is even further from the half gershgorin disk which has radius 3 around the origin .",
    "@xmath129\\ ] ]      the next construction gives a @xmath130 positive semidefinite hermitian matrix @xmath131 with the triple eigenvalue `` 0 '' lying on the boundary of the half gershgorin disk .",
    "( this is very different from the example in remark 1 where the half disk and the third disk were the same . )",
    "the other eigenvalue is 6 and it lies on the `` quarter disk '' .",
    "this example comes from the hesse configuration of 9 points and 12 lines in @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath131 looks interesting on its own right .",
    "it shows further that strengthening theorem [ th : halfg ] to more general matrices ( with high multiplicity eigenvalues ) might be difficult .",
    "one possible realization of the hesse configuration is given by the following 9 points on the complex projective plane @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a third root of unity .",
    "in this arrangement each point lies on four lines and each line contains three points . our first matrix , @xmath135 records the linear dependencies of the points .",
    "it has 9 columns , one for each point , and 12 rows , one for each line . if @xmath136 and @xmath137 are collinear , then there are nonzero complex multipliers @xmath138 such that @xmath139 for example the sixth ( highlighted ) row in the matrix @xmath8 below represents the equation @xmath140    thus the matrix @xmath8 encodes the linear dependencies of collinear triples in the point - line arrangement of the hesse configuration .",
    "@xmath141\\ ] ]    the points of the hesse configuration satisfy the homogeneous system of equations @xmath142 where @xmath143 . an affine image of a solution is also a solution , implying that the rank of @xmath8 is at most 6 .",
    "it is easy to see that the rank is exactly 6 : the rank remains the same if one multiplies a matrix with its hermitian transpose ( complex conjugate transpose ) .",
    "so consider the @xmath144 matrix @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath146\\ ] ]    matrix @xmath131 is a positive semidefinite hermitian matrix that has two eigenvalues : 0 with multiplicity 3 ( so the rank of @xmath8 is indeed 6 ) and 6 with multiplicity 6 .",
    "all non - diagonal entries have norm one and the diagonal entries are 4 . thus @xmath147 is on the boundary of the half gershgorin disk @xmath148 and @xmath149 on the boundary of @xmath150 , the `` quarter disk '' .",
    "there are several questions that remain open .    * what can be said about the location of an eigenvalue with larger multiplicity ?",
    "our method , using the zonotope @xmath58 in the proof of theorem  [ th : second ] has its limitations .",

    "unfortunately one can not expect @xmath152 to go below @xmath153 , see exercise 14.9 in @xcite ) * how about other matrices ? what is the radius of the shrunken gershgorin disk which contains a multiple eigenvalue of a general complex matrix ?",
    "are there better bounds for special matrices , like real or positive semidefinite hermitian matrices ?",
