    "zeolite beta ( bea ) has been used as one of the active catalysts for carrying out several organic reactions such as epoxidation of olefins , @xcite aromatic and aliphatic alkylation,@xcite acid catalyzed reactions,@xcite etc .",
    "some of the important reactions which can be catalyzed by bea include , the baeyer  villiger oxidation ( bvo ) reaction and the meerwein  ponndorf  verley reduction of aldehydes and oppenauer s oxidation of alchols ( mpvo ) reaction.@xcite the reasons for using bea as an efficient catalyst are its relatively large pore size , its flexible framework and high acidity.@xcite it has been well established that the acidity of bea can be finely tuned by the incorporation of various atoms such as b , al , ti , zr , fe etc .",
    "@xcite@xmath0@xcite these sites substituted in the bea framework act as active bronsted or lewis acid sites depending upon their valence states.@xcite among these atoms , ti  substitution in bea framework has proven to be an active catalyst for the epoxidation of olefins in the presence of h@xmath1o@xmath1.@xcite@xmath2@xcite the other ti  zeolites , which have been succesfully used for the oxidation of small organic molecules , are the titanium silicates ( ts1 , ts2).@xcite several studies have been reported to understand the differences of the activity and selectivity between these two zeolites.@xcite@xmath2@xcite corma et al have shown that these differences are due to the hydrophilic / hydrophobic nature of the ti sites.@xcite@xmath2 @xcite they showed that the ti  sites in ts are more hydrophobic than the al  ti  bea .",
    "hence , ts was prefered over al  ti ",
    "bea when the solvent used in the reaction is prepared in aqueous medium .",
    "one of the challenges in this field is to increase the efficiency of a zeolite by substitution with other elements .",
    "such an attempt has been made recently by incorporating sn in bea .",
    "mal and ramaswamy succesfully synthesized the al  free sn ",
    "bea.@xcite in an interesting experimental work , corma _ et al _ showed that the incorporation of sn in the bea framework results into a more efficient catalyst for the bvo reaction in the presence of h@xmath1o@xmath1.@xcite in their study , a new mechanism was proposed for the oxidation of ketones .",
    "they showed that the sn site in bea activates the carbonyl group of the cyclohexanone followed by the attack of h@xmath1o@xmath1 , unlike the ti sites which initially activate the h@xmath1o@xmath1 .",
    "this result was attributed to the higher lewis acidity of the sn site with respect to the ti site .",
    "hence , incorporation of sn in bea leads to a high selectivity towards the formation of lactones in the bvo reaction.@xcite@xmath2 @xcite on this background , highly selective mpvo reactions were carried out more efficiently with sn ",
    "bea than ti ",
    "bea.@xcite in these studies , it was shown that the sn site is situated within the framework and no extraframework sn was detected .",
    "although much of the experimental studies have focused on the efficiency of the sn ",
    "bea , the higher lewis acidity of the sn site compared to the ti site in bea is still not known .",
    "recently , sever and root used the m(oh)@xmath3 ( m = sn , ti ) cluster models to investigate the reaction pathways for the bvo reaction.@xcite    the activity and selectivity of the zeolite mainly depend on the nature of the active sites , such as local coordination , interaction with the incoming molecules , percentage of substitution of t atoms in the framework , etc .",
    "one of the important issues concerning the activity and selectivity of the zeolite is its hydrophobic / hydrophilic nature.@xcite@xmath2 @xcite it is known that if the zeolite is hydrophilic in nature , the water present in the solvent poisons the active sites .",
    "this hinders the kinetics of the reaction and decreases the activity of the zeolite .",
    "et al _ have bypassed this problem by modifying the catalyst design , which allows the use of sn  bea in the presence of aqueous media.@xcite very recently , boronat _ et al _ have done theoretical calculations using a sn(osih@xmath4)@xmath4oh cluster model to understand the effect of h@xmath1o during the bvo reaction .",
    "their results show that one water molecule is permanently attached to the sn active site .",
    "interestingly , fois _ et al _ have studied the interaction of water molecules with the ti sites in ti  offretite using car ",
    "parrinello molecular dynamics.@xcite they found that at higher loading of water molecules , the ti atom expands its coordination number .    in the last decade , several experimental and theoretical studies have been employed to characterize the role of ti sites at a microscopic level in various ti - zeolite systems.@xcite@xmath2@xcite@xmath2@xcite it has been revealed that due to high crystallinity , low ti content and large quadrupolar moment of ti , accurate information on the ti sites in bea is not possible through experimental techniques.@xcite hence , it is necessary to use theoretical methods to explore the local behavior for eg .",
    "structure , electronic and bonding properties of these sites .",
    "sastre and corma have used _ ab initio _ calculations to discuss the role of the ti sites in ti  bea and ts1.@xcite the energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of ti  bea and ts1 with one ti substituted in turn at every t site , were shown to be different .",
    "furthermore , the ti  sites in ti  bea were found to be more acidic than in ts1 and this acidity varies among all the ti  sites in both zeolites.@xcite this proves that not only different ti  containing zeolites have different acidity , but also different t ",
    "sites within a particular zeolite would have varying acidity . very recently , bare et al have used exafs technique to investigate the sn ",
    "site in sn ",
    "bea.@xcite they showed that sn was not randomly distributed in bea , and takes specific crystallographic sites , i.e. t5/t6 sites in their nomenclature , which corresponds to t1 and t2 in our nomenclature , following newsam _",
    "et al_.@xcite surprisingly , they found that this substitution takes place through pairing of these sites , within the six membered ring i.e. two t1 or two t2 .",
    "however , no explanation was given for this distribution .",
    "at the same time , in a theoretical work using a periodic approach based on density functional theory ( dft ) we characterized the sn  sites in bea.@xcite we showed that the t2site would be the most probable site for the sn substitution based on thermodynamics consideration of the largest cohesive energy in a dehydrated bea zeolite .",
    "moreover , we found that the substitution of 2 sn atoms per unit cell was thermodynamically unfavorable .",
    "this was consistent with the earlier experimental results .",
    "parallel to this , boronat _ et al _ carried out a cluster calculation of the sn ",
    "bea interaction with cyclohexanone and h@xmath1o@xmath1.@xcite they showed that the bvo reaction in sn ",
    "bea is due to the activation of cyclohexanone at the sn site .    as it can be seen from the above description , the incorporation of sn in bea proves it to be a better catalytic site than ti .",
    "hence , a detailed information on the differences in the properties of sn and ti sites in bea , such as the quantification of the lewis acidity , number of t atoms to be substituted in the unit cell and hydrophobicity , are of fundamental importance and are still to be resolved .",
    "the aim of the present theoretical study is to bring out the differences in these substituted bea zeolites by analyzing their structural , electronic and hydrophobic properties .",
    "moreover , it is also important to understand why the framework sn site activates the carbonyl group of cyclohexanone and not h@xmath1o@xmath1 in the bvo reaction , while ti behaves the other way .",
    "we investigate this issue on the basis of hard ",
    "soft acid  base ( hsab ) principle .",
    "several theoretical studies based on a classical as well as quantum potential have been proposed to study the properties of zeolites.@xcite@xmath2@xcite@xmath5@xcite it has been a practise to adopt cluster models cut from the zeolite crystals to study these properties .",
    "one of the obvious reasons to use cluster model is that it is computationally cheap .",
    "et al _ have done an extensive study of zeolites using cluster models.@xcite@xmath2@xcite however , the active site represented in the cluster model is in a different electronic environment than in which it would be in a crystal.@xcite@xmath2@xcite@xmath2@xcite a periodic approach provides a more realistic description to study the properties of a crystal.@xcite@xmath2@xcite although zeolite catalysts are neither crystals nor periodic solids , it is more convenient to use periodic boundary conditions , when there are very few substituted sites per unit cell .",
    "1 ]    earlier experimental studies have indeed proved that sn and ti sites in bea are very few , that they are situated within the framework and during the bvo or mpvo reaction these sites do not dissociate from the framework.@xcite@xmath6@xmath2@xcite in the present work we have employed the periodic dft to investigate the properties of sn  bea and ti  bea .",
    "advantage of using periodic boundary conditions is that the long range electrostatic interactions are included within ewald summations .",
    "the instantaneous stationary electronic ground state is calculated by solving the kohn - sham equation based on dft .",
    "the valence electrons have been represented by the plane waves in conjunction with the vanderbilt s ultra ",
    "soft pseudopotential for the.@xcite it is worth mentioning that during the interaction between two systems the complete plane wave avoids the basis set superposition error .",
    "the exchange correlation functional is expressed by the the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) with the perdew  wang 91 functional.@xcite the calculations were restricted to the gamma point in the brillouin zone sampling .",
    "all the calculations have been performed by the vasp code.@xcite    bea is a high silica zeolite and consists of two different ordered polytypic series _ viz . _",
    "polymorph a and polymorph b.@xcite it has two mutually perpendicular straight channels with a cross section of 0.76 * 0.64 nm which run along a and b directions .",
    "intersecting to these , at right angles , a helical channel of 0.55 x 0.55 nm also exists along the c - axis .",
    "this gives rise to a three dimensional pore system of 12membered ring aperture .",
    "the unit cell of an ideal fully siliceous bea consists of 192 atoms with 64 si and 128 o atoms distributed within the tetragonal lattice of dimension 12.6 x 12.6 x 26.2  .",
    "there are 9 distinct crystallographically defined t sites as shown in fig .",
    "1 . we adopt the experimental structure as defined by newsam _",
    "et al _ and accordingly define the 9 t sites in the unit cell of bea.@xcite    the structural optimization of the si , sn and ti  bea have been carried out in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "conjugate gradient method was used to optimize the unit cell of bea .",
    "the optimization was considered to achieve when the forces on the atoms were less than 0.1 ev /  . in the second step , these optimized geometries were re ",
    "optimized with quasi ",
    "newton method unless the forces on the atoms were less than 0.06 ev /  .",
    "one should note that during the optimization the cell shape of the unit cell has been fully relaxed , while keeping its volume constant . in the case of sn and ti  bea each of the 9 distinct t sites were substituted by sn and ti atoms ( i.e. si/(sn or ti ) = 63/1 , respectively , and were optimized .",
    "once the active site in sn and ti  bea was confirmed , one water molecule was introduced near to these active sites and the same optimization procedure was followed as discussed above . the structural data for the sn ",
    "bea has been taken from a recent publication by us.@xcite in addition to this , we have also carried out dft calculations of cyclohexanone and h@xmath1o@xmath1 molecules using a supercell .",
    "these systems were optimized by the conjugate gradient methods only , until the forces on the atoms were less than 0.005 ev /  .",
    "we have already discussed the structure and energetics of sn  bea in a recent publication.@xcite in the present work we briefly recall this discussion which is necessary for comparing it with the structure and energetics of ti  bea and also to study its hydrophobic characteristic .",
    "table 1 and table 2 present the optimized structural details of all the 9 t sites of sn  bea and ti  bea , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that only the average bond distances and bond angles are presented . it can be seen from table 1 that the sn  o bond distance range between 1.908 to 1.917  , the sn ",
    "o  si bond angle range from 136 to 144.2 deg and the sn ",
    "si distance is around 3.241@xmath70.100  .",
    "very recently , bare _ et al _ , with the help of exafs technique showed that the sn ",
    "o bond distances and the sn ",
    "si distances in sn  bea were around 1.906  and 3.5  , respectively.@xcite this clearly shows that the theoretical results presented by us are in good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "however , the theoretical results of bare _ et al _ were not consistent with their experimental data",
    ". this may be due to keeping the shape of the unit cell fixed during the optimization and using the local density approximation exchange  correlation potential in their study.@xcite on the other hand , we have relaxed the lattice vectors of the unit cell during the optimization and also used the gga exchange  correlation potential , as explained in the earlier section . the change in the local coordination of the t site in sn ",
    "bea compared to the si ",
    "bea has been illustrated in the earlier study .",
    "as already mentioned above , sites t5 and t6 of ref .",
    "25 correspond to sites t1 and t2 in our work , in which we use the nomenclature of newsam et al.@xcite    .optimized structural parameters of sn  bea .",
    "average sn  o bond lengths , sn  o  si bond angles and sn ",
    "si distances of all the 9 t sites of sn  bea . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in earlier experimental studies it has been proposed that the sn site in bea polarizes the carbonyl oxygen atom of cyclohexanone and forms a lewis adduct.@xcite@xmath2@xcite from above , we have shown that sn - bea behaves as a sa , compared with ti - bea .",
    "table 6 presents the homo and lumo energies of cyclohexanone and h@xmath1o@xmath1 .",
    "we observe that the homo energy of cyclohexanone is @xmath860 kj / mol lower in energy than the homo of h@xmath1o@xmath1 .",
    "hence , cyclohexanone and h@xmath1o@xmath1 are hb and sb , respectively . from the hsab prnciple",
    "we infer that the sn ",
    "bea interacts with the cyclohexanone molecule to form a sa  hb complex or a lewis adduct .",
    "the present theoretical investigation reveals the differences between the sn  bea and ti  bea based on their structural , lewis acidic and hydrophobic properties .",
    "our analysis shows that the sn and ti atoms may occupy t2 and/or t1 crystallographic positions in bea .",
    "although the first coordination shell of sn is larger than ti , the second coordination shell in both model zeolites is similar .",
    "this explains the relaxation of the local environment of the substituted site . the structural data on sn  bea and ti  bea presented in this work are in good agreement with the earlier experimental studies .",
    "the cohesive energy results demonstrate that the incorporation of ti is more favorable than sn in bea .",
    "nevertheless , we show that sn ",
    "bea is more lewis acidic than ti , and hence proves to be a more efficient catalyst for the oxidation reactions than ti  bea .",
    "one of the important aspects concerning the activity and selectivty of the zeolite which we have addressed in the present work , is the water resistant property of the sn  bea and ti  bea . a stable interaction of h@xmath1o with the active sites of sn  bea and ti  bea is more favorable with sn  bea .",
    "hence , the hydrophobic property of the sn  bea and ti  bea zeolites is predicted , as well as their comparison .",
    "this clearly justifies the water resistant lewis acidic sites in sn  bea .",
    "we also extend our analysis to explain that the interaction of the water molecule with the ti and the sn sites in bea is a mere physisorption rather than chemisorption .",
    "furthermore , we use the hsab principle to interpret the formation of lewis adduct between the sn site and the cyclohexanone .",
    "the present work gives thus an insight into the microscopic properties of the active sites in sn  bea and ti  bea and the differences between them , which would have been otherwise difficult to understand through experimental methods .",

    "<S> the results also justify that the percentage of sn substituted in bea is less than ti . </S>",
