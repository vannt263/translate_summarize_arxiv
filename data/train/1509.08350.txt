    "delayed feedback was found to be a highly efficient tool for controlling the coherence of noisy oscillators  @xcite .",
    "even weak feedback with sufficiently long delay time can diminish or enhance the phase diffusion constant , quantitative measure of coherence , by one order of magnitude and even more .",
    "the theory of the delay feedback control of the phase diffusion was developed in  @xcite .",
    "however , for long delay times and vanishing noise , the multistability of the mean frequency can occur . in the presence of multistability , noise results in intermittent switchings between states with different mean frequencies and , thus , the phase diffusion is contributed not only by fluctuations around the mean linear growth of the phase but also by the alternation of ` local ' mean growth rates . for weak noise  which is a physically relevant situation ",
    "it turns - out to be possible to find natural variable in terms of which the switching between two stable phase growth rates becomes a perfect telegraph process . in  @xcite , frequency multistability and noise - induced switchings were studied for extremely long delay times , although without consideration of coherence and phase diffusion .    in this work , on the basis of the ` telegraphness ' property",
    ", we construct the analytical theory of the effect of delayed feedback on the phase diffusion in the presence of multistability . in agreement with the results of numerical simulation",
    "we analytically derive that the phase diffusion constant has giant peaks close to the points where the residence times in two states are equal .",
    "the dynamics of a limit - cycle oscillator subject to weak action can be described within the framework of the phase reduction , where the system state in determined solely by the oscillation phase  @xcite .",
    "the phase reduction can be used as well for the case of weak noise , including a @xmath0-correlated one  @xcite . for nearly harmonic oscillators",
    "subject to white gaussian noise and linear delayed feedback the phase equation reads  @xcite @xmath1+\\varepsilon\\xi(t)\\ , , \\label{eq-01}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the natural frequency of the oscillator , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the strength and delay time of the feedback , respectively , @xmath5 is the noise strength , @xmath6 is the normalised @xmath0-correlated gaussian noise : @xmath7 recently , a strong impact of weak anharmonicity for recursive delay feedback has been reported for the effects under our consideration  @xcite ; however , for a ` simple ' delay the harmonic approximation and model reduction   remain well justified for many physical , chemical and biological systems ( _ e.g. _ , see  @xcite ) .",

    ", delayed feedback has been found to change the mean oscillation frequency @xmath12 and the diffusion constant @xmath11 as follows  @xcite ; @xmath13",
    "let us first discuss the system dynamics for vanishing noise . in the solution of equation   is plotted for the noise - free case with the solid line .",
    "one can notice that for large @xmath4 the frequency @xmath12 is not always unique , which has already been noticed in  @xcite .",
    "the linear stability analysis for this system reveals that the linear growth solution @xmath14 is unstable when @xmath15 . in  @xcite",
    ", the stability analysis can be found for the monotonous perturbations , the analysis for the oscillatory perturbations ( to be published elsewhere ) does not change this condition .",
    "if one moves along the curve in from the origin , this condition will be fulfilled on the segments of the line going from the minimal values of @xmath12 towards the maximal ones between points with vertical inclination .",
    "these segments , say @xmath16 , are plotted with gray and separate the branches of stable solutions which are plotted with blue , @xmath17 , and red , @xmath18 , in the domains of multistability .",
    "equation system   is derived within the framework of the linear - in - noise approximation , which considers only small fluctuations around a state with constant phase growth rate @xmath12 ; it does not handle hopping between several states with @xmath19 .",
    "equation   has to be considered as a ` local ' phase diffusion at the state with corresponding @xmath12 .",
    "the system dynamics is dominantly controlled by the delay term , which makes the events of transition between two stable states of the noise - free system non - local in time ; for instance , @xmath20 can be kicked - out by noise from @xmath17 , reach @xmath18 and then again return to @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the noise - driven dynamics of the system in the presence of multistability is a non - trivial problem requiring subtle consideration . for longer delay time @xmath4",
    "there are domains with more than two locally stable regimes . as a first step , in this work we restrict our consideration to the case of multistability between two stable regimes ; for @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( )",
    "this is the case as long as @xmath23 .",
    "let us rewrite equation   in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the phase growth per delay time .",
    "this integral form of our dynamic system suggests that @xmath26 can be a suitable ` natural ' variable to trace the switchings between two states .",
    "indeed , in one can see that in terms of @xmath27 the system state is a ` telegraph ' signal ; transitions between two states occur without immediate reversals ",
    "each reverse transition occurs as an event independent of the previous transition  the residence time distributions for two states are exponential .",
    "this ` telegraphness ' can be used to develop analytical theory of the dynamics of a system with multistability .",
    "the diffusion constant of an asymmetric telegraph process altering between two states with growth rates @xmath17 and @xmath18 and mean residence times @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , can be calculated ; @xmath30 the net phase diffusion is contributed by ` telegraph ' diffusion and local diffusions at states @xmath31 ; @xmath32 where @xmath33 ( equation  ) .",
    "singular behaviour is observed for the local phase diffusion at the edges of the multistability domains ( ) . in the local phase diffusions @xmath34 are plotted with the solid line .",
    "the line is black for the domains with no multistability and coloured otherwise ; the same colours mark corresponding regimes in .",
    "one can notice that at the edges of the multistability domains for the regime experiencing the tangential bifurcation at this edge the local phase diffusion   tends to infinity .",
    "this divergence of local diffusion rises the question how the net diffusion behaves on the edges of the multistability domains . to answer this question",
    ", one can perform a normal form analysis of the system near the tangential bifurcation in the presence of weak noise and derive scaling properties for quantifiers of interest .",
    "let us consider a point of the tangential bifurcation where regimes @xmath16 and @xmath18 appear ( annihilate ) , @xmath35 , and describe the noise - induced behaviour of the system for @xmath36 .",
    "the normal form of the system dynamics near the bifurcation point reads @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a positive number of order of magnitude of @xmath41 . for this normal form the mean first passage time from the potential",
    "well can be calculated for weak noise ; @xmath42^{-\\frac{1}{2 } }   \\exp\\left(\\frac{4}{3\\varepsilon^2}[k_2(\\tau-\\tau_{2\\ast})]^\\frac{3}{2}\\right ) .",

    "subtle analysis of equations   yields the scaling law for the local diffusion @xmath46 ; it will be convenient to introduce constant @xmath47 as follows @xmath48 .",

    "thus , both the telegraph diffusion and the contribution of the diverging local diffusion into the net diffusion vanish at the edge of the multistability domains , and the behaviour of the net diffusion is regular , as it can be also seen from the results of numerical simulation ( see  ) .      within a multistability domain",
    "the mean residence time @xmath28 decreases as @xmath4 increases and tends to zero at the right edge of the multistability domain , while @xmath29 increases starting from zero at the left edge of the domain . at certain value",
    "@xmath53 these times become equal , @xmath54 .",
    "let us consider the vicinity of this point .",
    "for small deviations @xmath55 , one can write @xmath56   \\equiv t_\\ast\\exp[\\mp(q_{1,2}/\\varepsilon^2)\\delta\\tau]$ ] .",
    "notice , since the mean residence times depend on @xmath4 exponentially strong with small number @xmath57 in the denominator of the argument of the exponential , we linearise not @xmath58 but @xmath59 next to @xmath53 .",
    "coefficients @xmath60 are positive number of order of magnitude of @xmath41 . hence , @xmath61 the exponential in the nominator is a small correction to the cube of hyperbolic cosine in the denominator .",
    "one has to expect a strong peak near @xmath62 with height somewhat above @xmath63 .",
    "notice , for the weak noise , the latter expression is exponentially large , as @xmath64 is exponentially large .",
    "moreover , for vanishing noise the width of the peak @xmath65 , while its height is exponentially large in @xmath66 , _ i.e. _ , the integral of this peak over @xmath4 diverges exponentially fast .    in one",
    "can see these peaks in the results of numerical simulation .",
    "noteworthy , these peaks have a well pronounced triangular shape in the linear  log scale , meaning equation   to represent the behaviour of the phase diffusion remarkably well for the major part of each multistability domain , not only at its centre . in one",
    "can see how the noise strength influences peaks in multistability domains .",
    "the numerical simulation data in all the figures are calculated with time series of length @xmath67 .",
    "in this paper we have developed the theory of the effect of delayed feedback on coherence of noisy phase oscillators in the presence of frequency multistability induced by this time delay .",
    "the coherence has been quantified by the phase diffusion constant @xmath11 .",
    "the process of alternation between two states has been demonstrated to be well representable as an asymmetric markovian ` telegraph ' process .",
    "employment of this ` telegraphness ' property allows constructing the framework for analytical study on the problem .",
    "the behaviour of the phase diffusion constant has been revealed to be smooth on the edges of the multistability domains .",
    "giant peaks in the dependence of the phase diffusion constant on delay time have been discovered near points where the mean residence times in two states are equal ( see equation   and figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) . remarkably , their ` integral strength ' increases for vanishing noise , as their width @xmath65 while height is exponentially large in @xmath66 .",
