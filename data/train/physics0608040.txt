    "the teaching of special relativity is often confronted with mathematical or conceptual difficulties . a clear mathematical formulation using tensors is generally considered to be too difficult for undergraduate level .",
    "the use of simpler mathematics together with the verbal description of the counter - intuitive physics underlying relativity also poses a great challenge for teachers and students .",
    "verbal explanations trying to use pictures of classical physics in special relativity are at best confusing to the students .",
    "several so called paradoxa arise from attempts to explain relativistic phenomena using a terminology coming from classical physics .",
    "sometimes , one single quantity in a theory splits into several distinct quantities in the generalised theory .",
    "one example is the velocity in classical mechanics . in the widest sense , velocity or speed means the covered distance divided by the time needed to cover it",
    "this is uncritical in classical physics , where time and distance are well defined operational concepts that are independent of the frame of reference , in which they are measured . in special relativity ,",
    "these concepts depend on the frame of reference in which they are defined , if the frames are not at rest with respect to each other .",
    "this makes it necessary to distinguish between the different possibilities regarding the frame of reference in which the spatial and the temporal intervals are measured .",
    "this is best illustrated with a common situation of measuring the velocity of a rolling car .",
    "firstly , the velocity of the car can be measured by driving past kilometer posts and reading the time at the moment of passing the post on synchronized watches mounted on the posts .",
    "secondly , the driver can also measure the velocity by reading the corresponding times on a clock which is travelling with the car .",
    "thirdly , a person with clock standing beside the street can measure the times on his clock at the moments , when the front and the rear ends of the car are passing him .",
    "the travelled distance is then taken from a measurement of the length of the car in the frame of reference of the car . a fourth possibility measures",
    "the velocity of the car up to an arbitrary constant by measuring its acceleration using an accelerometer travelling with the car , e.g. by measuring a force and using newtons second law , and integrates the measured acceleration over the time measured with a clock , also travelling with the car .    in classical mechanics , all four measurements are equivalent and",
    "give the same value for the velocity .",
    "in special relativity , the first possiblility gives the coordinate velocity , which is often referred to as the genuine velocity .",
    "the second and third possibilities are equivalent , but are hybrid definitions of the speed .",
    "the temporal and spatial intervals are measured in different frames of reference .",
    "this speed is sometimes called celerity , or proper velocity @xcite . in addition",
    ", proper velocity is the spatial part of the vector of four - velocity @xcite .",
    "the fourth definition of a speed , sometimes called rapidity , is somewhat distinct from the other concepts of speed in so far as it can only be determined as a change of speed .",
    "the need to measure an acceleration in the moving frame by means of measuring a force qualifies rapidity to bridge kinematics and dynamics .",
    "this seems to be not critical in classical mechanics , if the concept of force is accepted as an operational quantity .",
    "however , it can also be used to determine the relativistic version of newtons second law if viewed from the accelerated frame of reference .    in this paper , a way to introduce the kinematics and dynamics of special relativity is proposed by defining and consistently using the different concepts of speeds .",
    "this method requires the knowledge of the lorentz transformation and the concept of spacetime .",
    "the kinematics of the uniform movement but also the kinematics and dynamics of accelerated motion can be rigorously introduced in a simple and intuitive way .",
    "the results are applied to an intergalactic spaceflight with constant acceleration , and the problems arising from relativistic effects encounterd during such a spaceflight are discussed both qualitatively and quantitatively .    in the following ,",
    "we use the dimensionless speeds , @xmath0 for coordinate velocity , @xmath1 for the proper velocity and @xmath2 for the rapidity , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the corresponding speeds measured e.g in a metric system of units for time and distance , and @xmath6 is the velocity of light in vacuum .",
    "correspondingly , the acceleration is scaled with the speed of light , @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath8 has the dimension of a rate .",
    "mass @xmath9 is always considered to be the invariant rest mass .",
    "furthermore , we restrict our considerations to the 2-dimensional case of spacetime with one temporal coordinate @xmath10 and one spatial coordinate @xmath11 .",
    "this is the simplest , non - trivial case , in which the essence of many phenomena of special relativity can be learned .",
    "the hypotheses that underly the special theory of relativity exclusively concern space and time @xcite .",
    "the principle of relativity states that all inertial frames of reference are equivalent and no absolute frame can be singled out . from these principles",
    "an invariant velocity follows , which is in fact the speed of light .",
    "it serves as an absolute scale and couples space and time .",
    "this is best seen in the lorentz transformations that map the coordinates @xmath12 in one inertial frame of reference onto the coordinates @xmath13 in another inertial frame , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is often called relativistic factor .",
    "composition of the transformations of three collinearly moving frames yields the known theorem of the addition of velocities , @xmath16 , from which for @xmath17 and @xmath18 results @xmath19 .",
    "the general form of a transformation corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lorentz1 ] ) is @xmath20 the general parameter @xmath21 for the movement is defined by the choice of the functions , and can be expressed with the coordinate velocity , @xmath22 however , in most cases , no simple interpretation of @xmath23 is possible .",
    "an example is given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where the relation of @xmath26 with the coordinate velocity is @xmath27 .",
    "composition of transformations yields that @xmath26 is multiplicative , @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath29 is the doppler shift .",
    "another example uses the hyperbolic functions @xcite , @xmath30 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lorentz1 ] ) and ( [ eq : lorentz3 ] ) follows @xmath31 .",
    "composition of transformations yields the additivity of the parameter , @xmath32 , and thus the relation @xmath33 to the multiplicative parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the additivity of @xmath34 was already mentioned by @xcite .",
    "motion is generally described with a velocity , i.e. the differential limit @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a change in position within the time step @xmath37 , and @xmath6 is the speed of light . in galilean spacetime , @xmath37 and @xmath36",
    "are the same in all frames of reference . in relativistic spacetime",
    "this is not the case and a careful distinction of different operational definitions of speed has to be made .",
    "it is important to distinguish whether the two quantities @xmath36 and @xmath37 are measured in the same inertial frame or not .",
    "as mentioned above , the latter case is e.g. applied by car drivers for the calibration of the tachometer . for the proper velocity",
    "the time step @xmath38 is measured on the clock travelling with the car and the change in position ( kilometer posts ) @xmath36 is measured in the rest frame of the street , @xmath39 the reciprocal measurement yields the same result : an observer outside the car measures the time @xmath37 on her clock between the passages of the front and rear ends of the car , however , using the proper length @xmath40 of the car as specified by the manufacturer , @xmath41 since @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the proper velocity is related to the coordinate velocity by @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the proper velocity @xmath46 is an unbound quantity .",
    "another possibility to quantify motion is using quantities measured in the accelerated vehicle alone .",
    "the rapidity of a spacecraft is defined as the integral of the correspondingly recorded acceleration @xmath8 with respect to proper time @xmath47 , @xmath48 where the rapidity @xmath49 is defined up to an integration constant @xmath50 .",
    "this measurement is not critical in classical physics . in relativistic physics ,",
    "the observability of this acceleration is not obvious and needs further analysis .      in classical physics ,",
    "acceleration is defined by @xmath51 in relativistic physics , several possibilities exist whether for @xmath52 the coordinate velocity @xmath53 , the proper velocity @xmath54 or the rapidity @xmath55 , and whether the coordinate time @xmath37 or the proper time @xmath38 is chosen .    to introduce different definitions of acceleration , a spacecraft is considered , that changes its velocity in a given time interval .",
    "two inertial frames of reference , i@xmath56 and i@xmath57 , are defined , co - moving with the spacecraft at the beginning and at the end of the time interval , respectively .",
    "the coordinate velocities of i@xmath56 and i@xmath57 with respect to a chosen inertial frame of reference are @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and the corresponding velocity increment is @xmath60 .",
    "the relative velocity @xmath61 between i@xmath56 and i@xmath57 is given by the einsteinian velocity combination law , @xmath62 in the differential limit for vanishing length of the time interval , @xmath63 the acceleration @xmath8 defined by the velocity increment @xmath61 and the proper time interval @xmath38 are proper quantities determined in the frame of the spacecraft alone @xcite , @xmath64 and by integration , @xmath65 the rapidity @xmath49 is defined up to an integration constant @xmath50 . similar to proper velocity , rapidity is an unbound quantity . comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : speed5 ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cond ] ) and ( [ eq : lorentz3 ] ) , with an appropriate choice of the frame of reference , such that @xmath66 we find @xmath67    with eq .",
    "( [ eq : rap1 ] ) , the proper acceleration @xmath8 is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the coordinate acceleration .",
    "this is an interesting and useful result .",
    "the acceleration @xmath8 is not only the derivative of rapidity @xmath34 with respect to the proper time @xmath70 , but is equal to the derivative of the proper velocity @xmath71 with respect to coordinate time @xmath72 in an inertial reference frame .",
    "this corresponds to the definition of proper acceleration , which corresponds to the spatial part of the relativistic acceleration vector .",
    "equation ( [ eq : acc1 ] ) suggests to define the uniform accleration as uniform proper acceleration , @xmath73 , rather than a constant coordinate acceleration , @xmath74 .",
    "if the velocity of the spacecraft is @xmath75 at time @xmath76 , the rapidity after uniform acceleration @xmath8 at proper time @xmath70 is @xmath77 , and with eq .",
    "( [ eq : speed2 ] ) , the distance travelled in an inertial frame of reference is @xmath78.\\ ] ]    conversely , the proper time needed to travel the distance @xmath79 in the reference system is    @xmath80    integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : acc1 ] ) yields the needed coordinate time to reach the proper velocity @xmath71 , @xmath81    equations ( [ eq : acc2a ] ) and ( [ eq : acc4 ] ) constitute a parameter equation for the world line of an uniformly accelerated spacecraft .",
    "elimination of the parameter @xmath82 yields the coordinate equation , @xmath83 which is the equation of a hyperbola in a minkowski diagram .",
    "the asymptotes of the hyperbola have inclinations @xmath84 and are parallel to the light cone .",
    "figure [ f1 ] illustrates an interesting consequence : a spacecraft starting at @xmath85 moving with constant proper acceleration @xmath82 in the direction of the positive @xmath11-axis outruns a photon starting simultaneously at @xmath86 in the same direction ( misner et al . , 1973 ) .",
    "the spacetime of einsteinian relativity makes a revision of newtonian mechanics necessary .",
    "newtons second law involves more than one frame of reference and this turns out to have consequences on the dynamics .",
    "newtons second law @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the force acting during the time increment @xmath89 on the mass @xmath9 that moves with the velocity @xmath3 is rewritten as @xmath90 in relativistic spacetime it has to be specified that the time increment @xmath89 is measured in the frame of reference in which the mass is moving with velocity @xmath3 .",
    "( [ eq : feynman ] ) is the correct equation and has the property that all physical quantities are defined in the same frame of reference .    in this paper",
    "a derivation of relativistic dynamics is suggested in which newtons second law is written in quantities described in the rest frame of the accelerated mass .",
    "these quantities are the invariant mass , the proper time and the rapidity . for simplicity ,",
    "the derivation is restricted to linear motion and collinear acceleration .",
    "rapidity needs a concept of inertia for the measurement of proper acceleration , such that an accelerometer measures acceleration independent of the actual speed with respect to any inertial frame of reference .",
    "if this were not the case , then one specific inertial frame could be singled out to serve as an absolute frame of reference , and the principle of relativity would be violated .",
    "a measurement of a weight in a laboratory or in a spacecraft flying in space is a static measurement with respect to the spacecraft , and newtons second law applies exactly .",
    "an astronaut feeling a constant weight thus correctly interpretes the motion as uniformly accelerated . with a gyroscope ,",
    "it is possible to distinguish between a linearly accelerated or purely circular motion , or any combination of both .    in the simplest case of linear acceleration",
    ", the astronaut interpretes the proper acceleration as a change of the rapidity per proper time interval .",
    "furthermore , the constant weight of the astronaut is correctly interpreted as the constant force needed to accelerate the invariant rest mass with the constant proper acceleration , independent of the rapidity with respect to any desired frame of reference . in the case of non - uniform linear acceleration",
    ", the momentary weight @xmath88 can be interpreted as the constant force needed to accelerate the mass @xmath9 of the astronaut with the momentary proper acceleration @xmath8 , again independent of the momentary rapidity , @xmath91 which is the relativistic  second law  , eq .",
    "( [ eq : feynman ] ) , written in terms of velocity and time as measured in an inertial frame of reference moving with velocity @xmath92 relative to the astronaut with mass @xmath9 .",
    "this makes it particularly transparent that the factor @xmath93 in the relativistic relation between force and the acceleration stems from the transformation of space and time , and has no physical relation to the mass .    using the proper quantities ,",
    "the notation of classical kinematics can be recovered for relativistic kinematics , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : speed2a ] ) and ( [ eq : acc1 ] ) , such that the proper velocity is the derivative of proper length with respect to coordinate time and proper acceleration is the derivative of proper velocity with respect to coordinate time .",
    "this pattern can be extended to dynamics be defining force @xmath88 as the derivative of linear momentum @xmath94 with respect to coordinate time . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : force1 ] ) we get @xmath95 and consequently , the linear momentum is @xmath96 .",
    "the kinetic energy of a relativistic particle is best derived by computing the work applied to the particle to accelerate it to a velocity @xmath97 @xcite , @xmath98 where the particle travels a distance @xmath99 in the system where @xmath100 is measured . applying the relativistic second law ( eq .",
    "[ eq : force1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath101 where the dashed variables @xmath102 and @xmath103 denote the integrations variables , and the kinetic energy @xmath104 is a function of the final @xmath105 .",
    "to reach interstellar distances within a reasonable time , high velocities , and thus , continuous acceleration during travel time are required .",
    "a flight to a star must include two stages : acceleration to high velocities and breaking down the velocity to the velocity of the star . at a constant proper acceleration of 9.8 m / s@xmath106 ,",
    "corresponding to about 1 lightyear / year@xmath106 , a flight to @xmath8-centauri in 4.3 lightyears distance will last about 3.63 proper years . in the middle of the trip ,",
    "the rapidity of the spacecraft would be @xmath107 , the proper velocity @xmath108 and the coordinate velocity relative to earth @xmath109 .",
    "a flight to @xmath8-centauri and back to earth would last at least 7.26 proper years , whereas on earth 14.5 years would pass between take off and return of the spacecraft .",
    "the corresponding times to travel to the andromada galaxy and back is 58 proper years , and the corresponding speeds in the middle between earth and the andromada galaxy are @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 . on earth , about 8 million years elapsed during the corresponding trip to the andromeda galaxy in a distance of 2 million lightyears from earth , and back . at this constant proper acceleration",
    ", the covered distances become large at a large rate . in 20 proper years",
    ", the astronaut covers a distance of 250 million lightyears , 36 billion lightyears after 25 proper years .",
    "it is in principle possible to travel to the most distant galaxies within a human life time , as is outlined quite realistically in the science fiction novel  tau zero  by @xcite , if such a spacecraft would be available .",
    "however , the realization of this cosmic travel plan requires the solution of some serious problems , of which most are based on relativistic effects .",
    "the first problem concerns the necessary specification for the spacecraft that is able to accelerate over a long time in outer space .",
    "there are two different possibilities : the first is a rocket that carries all necessary fuel and energy from the beginning , and the second is the ramjet that collects interstellar matter that can be used for fuel and energy supply .",
    "many problems are caused by the existing radiation in space and the interstellar or intergalactic matter .",
    "although the spacecraft travels through almost empty space , problems are caused by the extreme doppler shift of the electromagnetic radiation at the high relativistic speeds , and even more , by the existing matter mostly in the form of hydrogen and helium atoms and dust particles .      the density of interstellar matter is estimated to be about one hydrogen atom per cubic centimeter within galaxies . between the galaxies , it is about 6 orders of magnitude smaller with about 1 hydrogen atom per cubic meter . within dense nebulae , particles made of ice and carbon of 10@xmath113",
    "kg may occur @xcite , however , they contribute only to about half a percent of the total mass .",
    "we assume that the spacecraft does not deflect the interstellar matter by using e.g. a magnetic field . in this case",
    ", the particles and atoms are stopped and collected by the ship . to calculate the particle flux @xmath114",
    ", the proper velocity @xmath71 is the adequate quantity .",
    "the number of collected particles depends on the volume @xmath115 of space covered by the spacecraft as measured in the reference frame of earth , however , seen from the spacecraft , the flux must be measured in units of proper time @xmath116 .",
    "the volume @xmath117covered in a proper time interval @xmath118 by a spacecraft with a cross sectional area @xmath119 at a proper velocity @xmath46 is @xmath120 and the corresponding particle flux @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the density of particles . with the assumption that the majority of particles are hydrogen atoms with a rest mass of @xmath123 kg , and with a particle density in intergalactic space of @xmath124 m@xmath125 ,",
    "the particle flux on the spacecraft at a velocity of @xmath126 becomes @xmath127 s@xmath128m@xmath129 , and the corresponding mass flux is @xmath130 kgs@xmath128m@xmath129 .    the momentum @xmath131 of a particle with mass @xmath132 is @xmath133 and thus , the pressure @xmath134 on the front of the ship exerted by this particle flux increases with the square of the proper velocity , @xmath135 corresponding to 150 pa for the above situation . the kinetic energy that each particle deposits in the ship is @xmath136 for a proton this corresponds to about 1 tev at @xmath126 .",
    "this energy can be reached in todays most powerful accelerators , such as tevatron at fermilab .",
    "the corresponding energy flux at the front of the ship is then @xmath137 wm@xmath129 , corresponding to a black body radiation with a temperature of nearly 30000 k.    equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) also indicates a problem of the bussard - ramjet .",
    "the kinetic energy of the collected particles eventually exceeds their rest energy , @xmath138 therefore , even if all of the rest energy of collected particles could be applied to accelerate the jet to propulse the spacecraft , its speed could never exceed @xmath139 .",
    "realistically , a nuclear fusion reactor gains about 1 per mille of the rest energy . this limits the speed of such a ramjet to about 3% of the speed of light .",
    "a bussard - ramjet could only operate at higher velocities if all the collected particles are funneled through the engines without stopping them .",
    "they would then have to be accelerated by using an energy source that has to be carried with the ship from the beginning of the journey .",
    "the spacecraft flies through a field of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the sources of this radiation are the stars and the cosmic microwave background , and its spectrum ranges from radio waves to gamma rays and beyond .",
    "the energy of the cosmic microwave background dominates the background radiation in deep space far away from stars . at relativistic speeds the radiation field",
    "is strongly changed due to doppler shift and aberration .",
    "the astronaut registers a radiation field of high intensity and shifted to high frequencies around the apex , i.e. in the direction of the journey , and very little radiation from the rest of the celestial sphere .",
    "the doppler shift in the direction of the apex is @xmath140 , where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the frequencies of the radiation in the rest frame of the radiation source and seen from the spacecraft , respectively . at @xmath143 , as in the middle of the trip to the andromada galaxy , the cosmic background radiation of a wavelength of 1 mm is shifted to soft x - rays with a wavelength of 5 ngstrm .",
    "the pressure of this radiation on the front of the spacecraft is @xmath144 pa , which is negligibly small compared with the pressure exerted by the intergalactic matter .",
    "however , when heading towards a star , the doppler shifted stellar radiation would become extremely hard and living organisms must be shielded from this radiation .",
    "the consequent distiction and application of the three types of speeds in teaching special relativity allows us to explain the relativistic kinematics and dynamics in an intuitive way .",
    "the description of motion , acceleration and linear momentum can be recovered in the classical way by replacing the coordinate velocity with the proper velocity .",
    "this fact is not novel since in the vectorial notation , the spatial parts of velocity and acceleration vectors correspond to proper velocity and proper acceleration .",
    "however , this is often obscured by taking the relativistic factor @xmath105 out of the vector components , thus writing the vectors as the relativistic factor times a vector with the components of the coordinate velocity .",
    "we used the facts that e.g. an astronaut in a spacecraft could not perceive a uniform motion of his spacecraft without looking out of a window , and he would perceive a constant proper acceleration by feeling his own constant weight independent , however , of his velocity relative to any external frame of reference . these situations can be mapped to everyday experiences in traveling with trains or airplanes , and thus , can be based on the classical concepts of motion and inertia .",
    "the application of the relativistic kinematics and dynamics to steady accelerated spaceflight may make the topic more appealing to students than misleading paradoxa and difficult concepts such as length contraction and time dilatation .",
    "the restriction to the two - dimensional spacetime , one temporal and one spatial coordinate , limits the application of this method to collinear motion , acceleration and forces . on the other hand ,",
    "the results offer the basis for the vectorial notation in two dimensions , which then can readily be extended to the 1 + 3 dimensional general case .",
    "the topic may then be extendend to what the astronaut really observes if he looks out of the window of his spacecraft , not length contraction , but aberration and doppler shift of electromagnetic waves , and it only makes sense to compare the different times that passed in the spacecraft and on earth when he returns to earth .",
    "the authors thank joachim stadel , who reviewed an earlier version of the paper and helped to improve it substantially ."
