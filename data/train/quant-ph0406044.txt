    "the practical implementation of quantum algorithms has so far been dominated by liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite techniques @xcite .",
    "the many algorithms successfully implemented on liquid state nmr systems include , most notably , deutsch s algorithm @xcite , grover s quantum search @xcite , and shor s factoring algorithm @xcite .",
    "this unrivalled success can be attributed to the high degree of coherent control over small spin systems and also to the long decoherence times in comparison with the timescales of the computation . however , one of the problems haunting the prospects of liquid state nmr as a practically scalable and `` truly quantum '' implementation , was that the states encountered in _ almost all _ of the previous implementations were highly mixed @xcite .",
    "the highly mixed states used in nmr raised two major concerns .",
    "first , there was the issue of initializing the spins into a well - defined state @xcite .",
    "it was shown that one could circumvent this problem @xcite by preparing pseudopure states @xcite , which behave _ effectively _ ( up to a certain scaling factor ) as pure states .",
    "this approach worked well for small spin systems , but can not be extended to larger systems , because of the exponential loss in signal with increase in the number of spins @xcite .",
    "secondly , the highly mixed states encountered in conventional liquid state nmr are separable @xcite . as entanglement could not exist in these systems , some authors suggested that nmr quantum computing could perhaps be explained using classical models @xcite . with separable states ,",
    "even the quantum nature of nmr quantum computing was under question !    motivated by these problems , we have previously demonstrated @xcite the preparation of an almost pure two - spin state , which lies above the entanglement threshold @xcite , for the two hydride nuclei in the organometallic compound , where dppe indicates 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane .",
    "this was achieved using laser induced addition of pure _",
    "para_-hydrogen  to  as discussed below .",
    "we now describe an implementation of the deutsch algorithm on this spin system , demonstrating that coherent manipulations of spins in our pure spin system can also be carried out .",
    "our experiments solve the two - fold problem of initialization and separability .",
    "we bypass the need for preparing pseudopure states , as our computation starts off directly with an almost pure werner state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the initial purity of the system lies above the entanglement threshold .",
    "we do not claim that our implementation _ actually _ involves entangled states  only that entanglement can be distilled from these states .",
    "the use of entanglement proper in the deutsch s algorithm has been discussed in more detail elsewhere @xcite . in short",
    ", the current work constitutes the first demonstration of a quantum algorithm in liquid state nmr using an almost pure initial state .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ phh ]",
    "we describe the use of _ para_-hydrogen  to generate spin systems in almost pure initial states , while in section [ deutsch ] we give a brief summary of deutsch s problem and the quantum algorithm devised to solve it .",
    "liquid state nmr can be used to implement the algorithm as with our two spin pure state ; this is discussed in section [ implementation ] and the experimental procedures and results are described in section [ experiment ] .",
    "finally , we present a concluding summary in section [ conclusions ] and also outline some possible directions for future work .",
    "the high spin - state purity in our experiment is a result of an effect called _",
    "para_-hydrogen  induced polarization ( phip ) @xcite .",
    "the existence of the _ para _ spin isomer of dihydrogen molecules , , is a consequence of the pauli principle and the symmetrization postulate @xcite .",
    "these require the overall wavefunction of the  molecule to be antisymmetric with respect to interchange of the fermionic nuclei .",
    "the translational and vibrational wavefunctions of  are always symmetric , as is the ground state electronic wavefunction , and so overall antisymmetry is achieved by choosing the rotational and nuclear spin wavefunctions such that their product is antisymmetric .",
    "it follows that  molecules in even rotational states ( @xmath0 ) possess an antisymmetric nuclear spin wave function and correspond to nuclear spin singlets , termed _ para _ ; similarly ,  molecules in odd rotational states ( @xmath1 ) possess a symmetric nuclear spin wave function and correspond to nuclear spin triplets , termed _",
    "ortho_.    interconversion of the two spin - state isomers of hydrogen is normally forbidden by angular momentum selection rules , but in the presence of a paramagnetic catalyst the symmetry of the system is broken , allowing these rules to be overcome .",
    "thus if hydrogen is cooled in the presence of an appropriate catalyst , it will become enriched in the ( low energy ) _ para _  form . upon moving away from the catalyst interconversion",
    "is again suppressed , and so the _ ortho_/_para _  ratio in effect _ remembers _ the temperature of the last conversion surface encountered .",
    "a temperature of is sufficiently low to cool @xmath2 of  molecules into the @xmath3 state @xcite and hence produce essentially pure _ para_-hydrogen .",
    "the sole antisymmetric state of two nuclei is the singlet state , and so pure _",
    "para_-hydrogen  will _ also _ have a pure nuclear spin singlet state .",
    "this ability to prepare a pure initial state is obviously attractive for nmr quantum computing experiments , but the _",
    "para_-hydrogen  molecule can not be used directly for nmr quantum computing , as it is nmr silent due to its high symmetry .",
    "this can be overcome by means of a chemical reaction , producing a new molecule , in which the two hydrogen atoms can be made distinct ( i and s ) and _ can _ be separately addressed . in conventional _",
    "para_-hydrogen  experiments the chemical reaction is slow in comparison with the frequency difference between the i and s spins of the reaction product .",
    "this causes the off - diagonal terms in the density matrix to dephase , producing a separable state .",
    "this dephasing can be overcome ( neglecting relaxation ) @xcite by applying an isotropic mixing sequence @xcite , but a much simpler approach is to ensure that the reaction is rapid in comparison with the dephasing and relaxation timescales .",
    "we achieve this through addition of _",
    "para_-hydrogen  to a highly reactive species , generated by laser flash photolysis of a stable precursor .    the state that we actually prepare in our _",
    "para_-hydrogen  experiments is observed to be a werner singlet state @xcite of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the singlet vector , which can be written in the computational basis as @xmath6 and the polarization @xmath7 determines the purity , with @xmath8 corresponding to the pure state ; for our system @xcite @xmath9 , and so the state is almost pure .",
    "the singlet state is one of the four bell states @xcite , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , all of which can be interconverted using local unitary transformations @xcite .",
    "the bell states can also be converted to basis vectors in the computational basis ( the usual starting point for quantum computations ) using a network of the form given in figure [ graphicsbell ] , which is a disentangling network .    ]",
    "the output qubit @xmath12 is determined by the label ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) of the input state @xmath15 and @xmath16 is determined by the sign ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) ; eigenstates can be converted back to the bell states , using the reverse of the circuit in fig .",
    "[ graphicsbell ] , and the mapping can be compactly expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the classical not of @xmath16 . with circuits built around the disentangling circuit ,",
    "we can achieve conventional two qubit initial states , starting off from @xmath21 .",
    "deutsch s problem @xcite was the first problem to be solved by a quantum algorithm .",
    "although its usefulness as a real - life problem is limited , it is nevertheless a convenient testing ground for quantum computation .",
    "a refined version of deutsch s problem @xcite is described in the following way .",
    "suppose we are given a binary string @xmath22 of length @xmath23 and a binary function @xmath24 acting on @xmath25 mapping it onto a single bit , @xmath26 or @xmath27 , _ i.e. _ ,  @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , we are _ promised _ that @xmath24 is either constant or balanced .",
    "( a constant @xmath24 outputs the _ same _ value , either @xmath27 or @xmath26 , for all @xmath29 possible input strings @xmath30 , whereas a balanced @xmath24 outputs @xmath26 for exactly half of the strings and @xmath27 for the other half . )",
    "the problem is then to find whether @xmath24 is constant or balanced using the minimum number of queries . in the classical setting , answering this question , in the worst case , would require @xmath31 queries .",
    "however , with a quantum algorithm it is possible to solve this problem in a single query , giving an exponential improvement over the worst - case classical version .",
    "the simplest form of deutsch s problem concerns the case of @xmath32 , with functions mapping a single bit onto a single bit , @xmath33 .",
    "there are four such functions , their operation being described by the truth table given in table [ truth - table - f ] . out of these four functions ,",
    "two are constant ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) and two are balanced ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "classically the problem is solved by evaluating _ first _",
    "@xmath38 and _ then _ @xmath39 and comparing the results .",
    "equivalently , @xmath24 is constant if @xmath40 and balanced if @xmath41 , where @xmath42 indicates addition modulo 2 .",
    "deutsch s algorithm enables us to find this global property of @xmath24 in a _",
    "single _ query .",

    "these gates are represented by the propagators @xmath48 , whose action on the input qubits can be expressed as @xmath49 leaving the first qubit unchanged .",
    "if @xmath50 is initialized as @xmath51 , the second qubit holds the value of @xmath52 after the computation , @xmath53 there are four propagators , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , corresponding to the four different functions .",
    "a suitable choice of propagators is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the unit matrix of order @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a pauli spin matrix @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to check that with appropriate initial states these propagators indeed reproduce the transformation given in equation [ classical - deutsch - x0 ] . in the usual language of quantum networks",
    "@xmath54 is a do - nothing gate ; @xmath55 is a @xmath27-controlled - not gate ; @xmath56 is a @xmath26-controlled - not gate and @xmath57 is a not gate on the second qubit .",
    "( reference @xcite contains a concise description of quantum logic gates in nmr ) .",
    "we can build a quantum circuit from these propagators , which is depicted in block form in figure [ graphicsclassical ] . with this network ,",
    "the second qubit evaluates @xmath52 , although the evaluation is classical and we still need _ two _ separate evaluations to determine the nature of @xmath24 , once with @xmath62 and once with @xmath63 .",
    "this circuit is , however , useful for illustrative purposes .",
    "for example , using this circuit one could verify the truth table in table [ truth - table - f ] . to solve deutsch s problem in a single step ,",
    "however , we exploit superposition states , preparing them from the eigenstates using hadamard gates @xcite .",
    "the corresponding network is given in figure [ graphicsdeutsch ] , and the algorithm proceeds as follows : the computation starts off in the state @xmath64 , the hadamard gates prepare the superposition state , followed by the unitary transformation @xmath48 , and the final hadamard gates then convert the superpositions back to eigenstates , with the first qubit ending in @xmath65the solution to the problem !    .",
    "[ graphicsclassical ] ]     represents a hadamard gate .",
    "[ graphicsdeutsch ] ]",
    "we have implemented the deutsch algorithm on an almost pure ( @xmath9 ) two qubit state using an nmr quantum computer .",
    "we also evaluated @xmath52 classically using the procedure already outlined . in an nmr quantum computer ,",
    "the qubits are spin-@xmath66 atomic nuclei ( in this case nuclei ) placed in a strong magnetic field , and the gates are implemented through a sequence of radio - frequency ( rf ) pulses , interspersed with properly timed delays , during which the spin system evolves under its own hamiltonian .",
    "details may be found in reviews of quantum computing with liquid state nmr , such as @xcite .",
    "here we use product operator notation @xcite for the states and propagators .",
    "pulse sequences are written from left to right and we label the two spins as @xmath67 and @xmath68 , in keeping with nmr parlance . the notation @xmath69 is used to represent a rotation by @xmath70 about the @xmath71 axis .    to implement the classical and quantum versions of the problem ( figures [ graphicsclassical ] and [ graphicsdeutsch ] ) , the individual gates have to be built from rf pulses and frame rotations .",
    "for example , the hadamard gate on a single qubit is a @xmath72 rotation about a tilted axis @xcite and can be achieved using the sequence @xmath73 .",
    "pulse sequences can also be simplified based on the properties of product operators : for example , if the hadamard acts on an eigenstate , the initial @xmath74-pulse can be dropped out as these states commute with @xmath74-pulses .",
    "we are therefore simply left with @xmath75 pseudo - hadamard operations which can be used as a simpler replacement for proper hadamard gates . likewise ,",
    "if a computation ends in a diagonal state , we can shift the @xmath76 pulses to the end ( right ) of the sequence , changing , of course , the phase of the @xmath77 pulses , and _ collapse _ the @xmath74-pulse with the final state .",
    "we are then left with a simple @xmath78 pulse in place of a strict hadamard . in the same spirit",
    ", the @xmath74-rotations can be moved within a sequence , either to the left or to the right , and can be viewed as rotations of the reference frame , often referred to as the abstract reference frame @xcite .",
    "we have used the abstract frames approach together with composite @xmath74-rotations @xcite to simplify our sequences .",
    "the unitary transformations corresponding to the four possible @xmath48 s are given in equations [ u00][u11 ] .",
    "@xmath54 is an identity gate , and translates to `` do nothing '' , while @xmath57 is a selective not gate on the second qubit , @xmath79 .",
    "the remaining two transformations , @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be expressed in product operator notation as , for example , @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "these transformations involve frame rotations , evolution under scalar coupling terms ( @xmath82 ) and soft pulses @xcite , selectively exciting the @xmath68 spin .",
    "selective pulses were implemented using the jump and return pulses described previously @xcite , so that our final simplified sequences comprise only hard pulses and delays .",

    "the laser flash acts as an initialisation switch , generating the pure state @xmath21 on demand , which is subsequently used for the implementation .",

    "for example , for the determination of @xmath38 the initial state @xmath102 can be prepared from the singlet state @xmath5 using the sequence * a * ( see table [ bell - to - zeeman ] ) . at this stage , we clean our state by applying a strong field gradient @xcite ; this will not affect the component of the state in the desired eigenstate , but the majority of unwanted terms will be dephased @xcite .",

    "spin @xmath68 always remains in negative absorption while the sign of the signal from spin @xmath67 encodes the final result.[graphics6 ] ]    although the overall results are clear , our spectra show several imperfections .",
    "each multiplet should in principle show a perfect absorption lineshape ( either positive or negative ) , and all the multiplets in all the spectra should ideally have the same intensity .",
    "in fact dispersive components are clearly visible , and there are considerable variations in multiplet intensities , both within spectra and between spectra .",
    "these imperfections are most pronounced in the spectra involving @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which were obtained with the longest and most complicated pulse sequences .",
    "the distortions can arise from many factors such as finite coupling evolution during delays , rf inhomogeneities , miscalibrated pulses and decoherence .    to simulate the effect of decoherence under both @xmath97 and @xmath98 relaxation processes , we employed a model based on the operator sum representation @xcite for phase and generalized amplitude damping .",
    "the model is crude and assumes independent uncorrelated relaxation processes , but is nonetheless useful in obtaining a rough first estimate of the effects of decoherence .",
    "we observe that the damping processes should result not only in an overall decrease in the signal intensity , but for the case of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 propagators can also lead to intensity imbalances within a spectrum : for experiments involving these two propagators one of the spins spends more time in the transverse plane than the other , and is therefore more prone to phase damping . in the worst cases ,",
    "this can cause an overall intensity imbalance of about @xmath111 , similar to the observed ratios .",
    "however for a small two qubit system such as ours , the effects of decoherence are not big enough to obscure the measurement results . comparing the intensities of the final spectra with the intensity of spectra obtained from the initial singlet state",

    "we have demonstrated an implementation of the deutsch algorithm to distinguish between constant and balanced functions using an nmr quantum computer with an almost pure initial state .",
    "we have also used the same system for classical evaluations of the function values . unlike previous implementations built around pseudopure states , our implementation uses almost pure states which can be made on demand by laser flash photolysis .",
