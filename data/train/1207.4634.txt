    "consequently the @xmath6 peakon solutions of the dp equation were constructed and the dynamics of these special solutions were also studied by lundmark and szmigielski @xcite .",
    "the prolongation algebra and the hamiltonian operator of this equation was reported in @xcite .",
    "vakhnenko and parkes have studied various travelling wave solutions of the dp equation including hump - like , loop - like and coshoidal periodic - wave solutions @xcite .",
    "qiao has come - up with three new types of soliton solutions to this model , namely m - shape peakons , dehisced solitons , double dehisced 1-peak solitons @xcite .",

    "the motivation comes from the contemporary interest in studying loop soliton solutions in integrable nonlinear evolutionary equations @xcite . to our knowledge",

    "the explicit form of two loop soliton or higher order loop soliton solutions are not yet reported .",
    "moreover the collision dynamics between the loop soliton solutions are also yet to be studied for this equation .    to explore loop soliton solutions in eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) we follow the procedure given by matsuno @xcite .",
    "the author has derived @xmath6-soliton solutions for the dp equation from the modified version of the kaup equation since the @xmath0-function of the latter is already known . by carefully examining the @xmath0- function we observe that one has the freedom in changing the sign of the coefficients of the exponential functions so that even after the sign changes the resultant @xmath0-function satisfies the bilinear identities . by taking this advantage , we reshape the @xmath0-function appropriately and derive loop soliton solutions in a systematic manner . in the case of a one soliton solution , since there is only one exponential function present in the @xmath0-function we simply change the sign of the coefficient in front of this exponential function and obtain a one loop soliton solution . in the case of two soliton solutions since there are two exponential functions present in the @xmath0-function one has two choices in fixing the coefficients of these exponential functions .",

    "we consider both solutions and study their interaction properties . to begin with ,",
    "we allow two loop solitary waves ( among the two , one is longer and the other is shorter ) to travel in a particular direction . as expected the taller loop wave travels faster than the smaller one and crosses the shorter loop wave in a finite time . when it approaches the smaller loop they start to interact .",
    "as a consequence the amplitude of the taller loop becomes shorter while the amplitude of the shorter loop becomes larger .",
    "this continues until the amplitudes of both the taller and shorter loop solitons become equal .    in the second parametric regime ,",
    "when the loop solitary waves cross each other the smaller and larger loop solitary waves overlap each other besides changing their amplitudes . in the third parametric regime",
    "we show that while the larger loop soliton overtakes the smaller one , the smaller loop solitary wave revolves circularly ( in the clockwise direction ) inside the larger loop solitary wave .",
    "in the second case ( mixed loop soliton - smooth soliton ) we allow the loop solitary wave to interact with the smooth solitary wave . here",

    "in this section , we briefly recall the method of constructing @xmath6- soliton solutions of ( [ a1 ] ) . the dp equation can be written in a compact form , @xmath7 , first by defining a new variable @xmath8 with @xmath9 and then introducing a reciprocal transformation , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , in the resultant equation . rewriting the relation ( [ b1 ] )",
    "one can express the old variable ( @xmath12 ) in terms of new variable ( @xmath8 ) as @xmath13 where we have dropped the tilde above ` @xmath14 ' for simplicity . from ( [ b2 ] ) we can find @xmath15 . substituting this derivative in the expression @xmath16 and differentiating the resultant equation with respect to @xmath17 we obtain a third order ordinary differential equation in @xmath8 . by successive differentiations this third order equation",

    "the soliton solutions of this member can be identified from the soliton solutions of the modified version of the kaup equation . from the known @xmath0-function of the kaup equation",

    "one can get an implicit form of @xmath28 . finally , substituting the expression @xmath8 in the mapping function , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an integration constant , and integrating it one can get a relationship between @xmath31 and @xmath17 .",
    "we note that the function @xmath32 should not vanish for any @xmath17 ant @xmath14 .",
    "otherwise a simple zero of @xmath8 would yield a logarithmic singularity of @xmath33 .",
    "expressions ( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ b8 ] ) constitute the solution for the dp equation in parametric form .",

    "to explore @xmath6-loop soliton solutions of the dp equation we modify the bilinear solution ( [ b4 ] ) as @xmath34 with all other parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 as given in eqs .",

    "we present the nature of the obtained solutions in fig . 1 .",
