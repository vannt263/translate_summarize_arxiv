    "symbiotic stars occupy an extreme and relatively poorly understood region of the binary classification scheme .",
    "the name was coined by @xcite to describe stars which appeared to have a combination spectrum : that of high excitation lines usually associated with a hot , ionised nebula superimposed on a cool continuum with prominent absorption features consistent with a late  type star . at present",
    "they are understood to be interacting binaries ( with orbital periods of a few to tens of years ) consisting of a cool giant losing material mostly via the stellar wind and a hot , luminous compact object which ionises a portion of the cool component wind @xcite .",
    "such a state of affairs represents the so  called _ quiescent phase _ , which can be interrupted by periods of activity .",
    "the _ active phases _ start with an eruption of the hot star , an event indicated photometrically by an increase of the star s brightness by 2 - 6mag , and/or spectroscopically by high velocity broad emission features from the central star .",
    "both radio and hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging can directly resolve the remnants of such dramatic events ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the symbiotic star chcygni displays particularly complex behaviour .",
    "optical spectroscopic studies by @xcite showed that the orbits of the stars within the system are likely to be coplanar and eclipsing , with eclipses separated by around 5700 days .",
    "later studies ( @xcite and references therein ) confirmed this period .    further spectral studies of the system @xcite suggested that chcyg is probably a triple - star system consisting of an inner 756-day period binary which is orbited by an unseen g - k dwarf on a 5300  day orbit .",
    "@xcite uncovered 756 day interval eclipses which show that all three stars in the system are likely to be in coplanar orbits .",
    "each of the three outbursts seen since 1978 was accompanied by high velocity broad emission features consistent with mass outflows . during 1984 - 85",
    "the material was ejected at @xmath2600 - 2500kms@xmath3 @xcite , whilst the 199295 active phase was characterized by sporadic and in part bipolar outflow at @xmath21000 - 1600kms@xmath3 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and finally , during the recent , 19982000 , outburst mass outflows at about 1000kms@xmath3 were observed ( @xcite , hereafter paper ii ) . the outflows may be correlated with a significant increase of the radio emission and the radio light curves during these periods fit well with the optical ones @xcite .",
    "the 1984 mass ejection has been linked to the emergence of bipolar emission @xcite which has been attributed to high velocity ( @xmath21000kms@xmath3 ) jets .",
    "thermal emission features have been discovered in these jets from radio observations ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) , explained by shocked regions that arise when the high  speed ejecta interact with existing wind material .",
    "this paper aims to extend our understanding of the jets in this interesting system by developing theories and models to explain the change in their morphology in the years following their emergence .    in this paper",
    "we present analysis of radio data from the vla and merlin , along with hst observations .",
    "ch cygni has been observed on several occasions since 1985 , in several different radio wavelengths and optical domains , further details of which are given in paper i. all observations have been presented previously with the exception of the 2000 november 10 ?",
    "vla data which is shown here for the first time .",
    "radio data reduction was carried out using the aips software package @xcite .",
    "the flux density of the phase reference source was determined , and the data calibrated to correct phase and amplitude instabilities .",
    "these corrections were applied to the observations of ch cygni and a map produced by deconvolving the instrumental response ( the so - called `` dirty beam '' ) from the map using the well - established clean algorithm @xcite .",
    "observations made on 1999 august 12 with the hubble space telescope s wide field and planetary camera 2 through the f502n filter , corresponding to the [ o iii ] line at @xmath44956 and 5007 ) @xcite , are used here as these , with a diffraction limted resolution of around 0.05  arcseconds , offer direct comparison with the spatial resolution of the radio data ( see table [ tab : restoringbeam ] .",
    "each observation was made up of two sub  exposures , allowing cosmic ray subtraction to be carried out ( see paper ii and references therein ) .",
    "a preliminary examination of radio maps of ch cygni ( taken with the vla and merlin ) , as well as the hst optical images ( using the f502n [ oiii ] filter ) show that the position angle of the extended regions changes drastically over the 15 years between the earliest ( 1985 ) and most recent ( 2000 ) observations .",
    "a more quantitative analysis requires a measurement of the position angle of the central regions of the radio nebula .",
    "a problem inherent in this method is that the geometry of the restoring beam ( in the case of the radio observations ) may dominate over any natural geometry of the region .",
    "this arises as a result of the @xmath5 coverage of the instrument , which depends upon the altitude of the source above the horizon .    to avoid these problems ,",
    "the radio maps were recreated using the methods of @xcite but a circular restoring beam was imposed upon them , as laid out in table [ tab : restoringbeam ] .    .restoring beams used at different radio observing frequencies . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : nwoffset ]",
    "a component moving ballistically , as described in section [ sec : ballistic ] , would exhibit a constant position angle ( @xmath6 ) and a radial distance from the core ( @xmath7 ) that increased linearly with time .",
    "if there is simple deceleration , @xmath6 would remain constant while @xmath7 changed according to an environment  dependent model .",
    "compared with the @xmath8  km  s@xmath3 velocity seen in the main portion of the jets , the north western emission is almost stationary on the sky .",
    "it is possible that the material has indeed almost stopped moving , perhaps due to interactions with the surrounding environment .",
    "the jet may have become entirely disrupted through shock  interactions and so would no longer obey the simple ballistic model .    for a jet that has a time ",
    "variable ejection direction , such as a precessing bipolar jet , shocks will form between the jet material and the surrounding medium not only in the main direction of jet propagation but also as a result of the transverse interactions between the two regions @xcite .",
    "the transverse velocity of the jet becomes an important factor at large distances from the point of ejection .",
    "a colimated outflow will only survive until the transverse shock has crossed the diameter of the jet . to simplify things ,",
    "the approximation of @xcite is used so that    @xmath9    most of these values can be estimated from work already carried out .",
    "the jet radius , @xmath10 , can be estimated by measuring the size of the anomalous region in the 1986 vla u band map .",
    "the region was found to be approximately circular with a mean diameter of 0.18  arcsec . assuming a distance of 268  pc this corresponds to a linear size of @xmath11  m. the initial jet ejection velocity was found in paper i to be @xmath12  m  s@xmath3 which is in agreement with that found by fitting to the the purely ballistic ejection model .",
    "the rate of precession can be found from the fitted period of 6519 days to be @xmath13rad  s@xmath3 .",
    "the opening angle , @xmath14 was estimated previously to be @xmath15 .",
    "the main unknown is the relative density parameter , @xmath16 .",
    "following @xcite , @xmath16 is assumed to be constant , so that the ambient medium is entirely homogeneous .",
    "this may not be the case , as a constant spherical outflow from a star is expected to produce an ambient density that varies as @xmath17 , and the presence of a jet would be expected to cause disruptions in the local region .",
    "however , without more knowledge of this region , a homogeneous medium is assumed for simplicity . @xcite",
    "derived a ratio of @xmath18 from line ratios in the herbig ",
    "haro object hh 111 v. if this applies to ch cygni , then @xmath16 is approximately equal to 0.2 .",
    "applying these parameters to equation [ eq : disrupttime ] gives a value for the time taken for the disruptive shock to cross the jet as @xmath19  s. the distance the material has covered in this time ( along the @xmath20 axis in figure [ fig : simplejet ] ) will be , for the parameters discussed above , @xmath21 au .",
    "the actual distance of the observed anomalies in the radio jet in 19861988 is indeed around 300  au .",
    "to determine whether this disruption is occurring , direct imaging of the shocked region is necessary .",
    "this has been done in the case of the herbig ",
    "haro objects hh46/47 @xcite and hh34 @xcite .",
    "h@xmath22 maps were subtracted from [ s ii ] maps ( at wavelengths 6717 and 6731 ) to produce images in which the leading bow shock and trailing jet shock could be seen separately .",
    "the ratio of the intensity of emission in the h@xmath22 and [ s ii ] was then used to derive the relative densities in the jet material and surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , whilst h@xmath22 emission maps of ch cygni exist ( paper ii ) , no maps in [ s ii ] are available .",
    "if the geometry of the jets is a result of them being gravitationally attracted to the outer giant , they would be expected to exhibit a morphology in which the position angle of the material is a function of distance from the ejection source , and in which there is reflective symmetry about the central core @xcite .",
    "such a model was applied successfully to 3c449 by @xcite .",
    "such a pattern does not fit the observed extensions in the ch cygni system , implying that the precession is due to effects within the collimating mechanism , rather than post  ejection gravitational influences .",
    "ch cygni is observed to undergo irregular outbursts with associated variable mass outflow rates .",
    "such a state of affairs renders invalid the assumption that what is being observed is a simple , continuous jet with constant ejection velocity .",
    "a jet that results from truly irregular outflows is difficult to model analytically using the methods described within this work .",
    "recent work , as described in paper ii , has discovered what may be two types of mass outflow from the system .",
    "one is optically thin , at a velocity measured spectroscopically to be 1200  km  s@xmath3 and the other is optically thick and highly irregular .",
    "there is evidence that the increase in mass  transfer from the cool component to the compact component that occurs near to times of periastron leads to higher luminosity of the compact component and , as a consequence , greater radiatively driven mass outflow .    assuming a distance of 268  pc @xcite",
    ", the movement between 1986 and 1988 shown in table [ tab : nwoffset ] represents an on  the  sky velocity of only @xmath23  km  s@xmath3 . extrapolating this motion backwards gives the time of ejection of this material , assuming ballistic motion , as around december 1978 .",
    "this time is near the beginning of the large outburst that lasted between 1977 and 1984 .",
    "minor outflows have been observed spectrally during the outburst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) at velocities of a few hundred km  s@xmath3 .",
    "these may coincide with the ejection of this anomalous packet of material .",
    "recent hst observations ( from october 1999 ) made by @xcite show the existence of loops of material in the [ oii ] nebula at a distance of @xmath24 and @xmath25 arcsec .",
    "echelle spectroscopy of these loops places their kinematical axis at around 100  km  s@xmath3 . allowing for projection effects ( i.e. assuming they are tilted at 37@xmath26 to the plane of the sky ) their kinematical ages are approximately 15.2 years for the inner loop and 51 years for the outer one , giving the times of ejection of the loops as august 1984 and february 1949 respectively .",
    "the 1984 event fits in well with the emergence of the radio jets first observed by @xcite and the model proposed in this section , but no records of a 1949 outburst could be found @xcite .",
    "precession of bipolar jets is a common phenomenon in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the precession is usually attributed to motion of the collimating mechanism of the jets .",
    "a simple collimating structure is a circumstellar torus or disk , such as that postulated by @xcite .",
    "flickering in the optical brightness of ch cygni has been observed on several occasions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and has been explained by the orbital motion of a bright point on a disk surrounding the compact component .",
    "there are several mechanisms by which such a disk could be induced to precess , and four of these scenarios are examined here .",
    "only one of these is able to cause precession at the rate that is observed , given suitable estimates for the appropriate parameters .",
    "the gravitational influence of the nearby cool component , or perhaps the possible third star in the system , could force precession in this disk , and hence the jets . following",
    "the work of @xcite , the angular speed of a torus or disk , with radius @xmath27 , undergoing forced precession as a result of the influence of a companion is    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the mass of the hot component , @xmath30 is the mass of the cool component , @xmath31 is their separation and @xmath22 is the angle between the equatorial plane of the torus and the orbital plane of the stars .",
    "estimates for the parameters , from the work of @xcite , are @xmath32m@xmath33 , @xmath34m@xmath33 and @xmath35  au .",
    "this relation assumes that the disk is centred on the hot component , and the companion star causing the forced precession is the cool giant on the 756 day orbit .",
    "it would also be sensible to assume that @xmath36 @xcite and @xmath37 . to obtain a precession period of 8373  days",
    "requires a disk radius of around 0.7  au .",
    "this is a very large accretion disk , and it would be hard to imagine how such a disk could form purely via wind accretion mechanisms , making this scenario unlikely .    if instead it is assumed that ch cygni is a binary system on a 5294  day orbit , with @xmath38au the disk radius is found to be around 21  au , around twice the size of the proposed semimajor axis of the outer giant s orbit .      an attempt to explain the observed 164  day period precession of the bipolar jets in ss433",
    "was made by @xcite , by assuming that the compact component was surrounded by an accretion disk that precessed at a rate governed by the apsidal motion of the parent star .    using equations 12 , 13 and 16 of that paper , taking reasonable stellar and orbital parameters of ch cygni from @xcite and assuming that the coefficient of apsidal motion is 0.005 @xcite suggests that the precession period of a slaved disk would be around 12000 years .",
    "this result is a strong function of the radius of the cool component , so an increase in this star s size by a factor of 4 would reduce this precession period to about 15 years .    to evaluate the possibility of such a model , precise eclipse timings need to be made in the future .",
    "an accretion disk that is irradiated by a central source can become warped as a result of a torque that arises due to radiation that is re  emitted from the disk @xcite .",
    "such a warped disk might be expected to precess .",
    "in contrast to the gravitationally induced precession mentioned above , this is `` self precession '' , in that no companion star is required . following the work of @xcite , the period of this precession is of the same order as the time it takes for the warping to develop in the disk . using sensible parameters for the mass of a possible accretion disk ( around @xmath39  m@xmath33 ) , this timescale is of the order of @xmath22000 years , making this an unsuitable model for precession .",
    "the inner region of an accretion disk surrounding a magnetic star , such as a white dwarf @xcite , is subject to a twisting torque and a warping torque .",
    "these arise as a result of the interaction between the surface current of the disk and the horizontal magnetic field that is a feature of the dipole field of the star @xcite .",
    "the warping torque arises through the twisting of the field that threads the disk vertically .",
    "the precessing torque is a result of the azimuthal screening current that occurs if the disk is diamagnetic . in this case",
    ", the vertical field lines can not penetrate the disk .",
    "an azimuthal current is induced in the disk .",
    "the radial component of the central star s magnetic field interacts with this current to set up a vertical force acting on the disk .",
    "this force is uneven across the disk , so a net torque results . this torque acts to cause the disk ( and hence the collimation mechanism of the jets ) to precess about the magnetic axis of the star .",
    "@xcite gives the angular precession rate of such a disk in equation 2.35 of that paper .",
    "presently , most of the required quantities are unknown , so only an order of magnitude estimate is possible .",
    "the magnetic moment of the white dwarf was estimated to be @xmath40  t  m@xmath41 using the method of @xcite , and the surface density of the disk was assumed to be of the order 10  kg  m@xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the angle between the disk axis and stellar rotation axis was taken to be equal to the opening angle of the precession cone , 35@xmath26 , found previously .",
    "the magnetic axis of the system was assumed to lie along the disk axis .",
    "the magnetically induced precession period is then directly related to the radial distance , @xmath27 , of the warped torus from the white dwarf .",
    "since this varies as @xmath43 , small changes in @xmath27 greatly affect the period .",
    "a warped torus at around 2  r@xmath33 from the star will precess with a period of around 6000 days .    a magnetic collimation and ejection mechanism for the jets gives a possible explanation for their one ",
    "sidedness @xcite .",
    "jets powered by a central magnetic rotator @xcite can become inherently asymmetric , if the solution to the magnetohydrodynamic equations for each hemisphere of the star are asymmetric .",
    "such conditions arise when there is no change in the relative sign of the poloidal and toroidal fields across the equator of the star",
    ". the different magnetic states above and below the equator can then easily lead to a condition in which only one supports the collimation and ejection of material via a jet @xcite .",
    "it is certain that the bipolar jets of ch cygni exhibit precession , with a period controlled by the motion of the mechanism resposible for the collimation of the outflow .",
    "in addition , the variability of the mass  loss rate from the cool component causes the material to be ejected at a rate that is highly variable ( between @xmath44 and @xmath45 km  s@xmath3 ) , leading to complications in predicting the outflow geometry .",
    "the activity of the bipolar ejection seems to be tied to the state of the hot  component , with fast jets seen at or soon after times of optical outburst .",
    "this activity then decreases during times of quiescence .",
    "although the precession period found here is similar to the orbital period of the outer giant in the system , the current time resolution of the observations does not rule out shorter periods .",
    "a precession that resulted from the motion of the inner , symbiotic , pair and had a similar period to its 756  day orbit would need observations to be taken at least every year for it to be detected .",
    "the simple ballistic model fits the geometry of the nebula extremely well .",
    "knots seen in the larger  scale radio maps ( the vla in c , x and u band ) that do not fit the simple ballistic model can be explained as regions of jet disruption caused by sideways motion of the ejected material brought about as a result of the precession .",
    "the predicted distance at which this disruption would occur is in close agreement with the observations , although it relies upon several assumptions about the nature of the ambient material .",
    "confirmation of this model would require simultaneous optical images in both h@xmath22 and [ s ii ] .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the anomalous material was ejected at a much slower velocity and at an earlier time than the majority of the gas in the bipolar nebula .",
    "this would indicate the presence of a minor ejection event prior to the main ejection of the jets first seen by @xcite . the variable ejection velocity model discussed here and the echelle spectroscopy of @xcite",
    "suggest the emission of material with a velocity of no more than a few 100s of km@xmath3 just before the main ejection of the high  speed material .",
    "the cause of the precession is unknown but , given realistic estimates for the masses and separation of the stellar components , warping of the collimating accretion disk by a magnetic white dwarf is the only mechanism that can give precession periods similar to those found by model fitting .",
    "the other possible causes give periods that are several orders of magnitude too large .",
    "the magnetic explanation also allows for the one  sided nature of the emission seen in all vla radio maps following the initial outburst in 1984 .",
