    "the two - dimensional billiard is an appropriate tool for examining the generic features of dynamical systems because of the wide range of dynamical behaviors going from the most regular ( integrable ) to the most irregular ( chaotic ) depending on the geometry of its boundary .",
    "although no mathematical proof exists , it is widely believed that fingerprints of the regular or irregular nature of the classical motion can be found in statistical properties of the quantum spectrum both in energy levels and wavefunctions .",
    "the integrable systems such as the circular , elliptic and rectangular billiards obey the poisson statistics @xcite , while the predictions of the gaussian orthogonal ensembles describe the chaotic systems such as sinai s billiard and bunimovich s stadium @xcite .",
    "besides these extreme classes , there is an intermediate category called _ pseudointegrable _ @xcite or _ almost integrable _",
    "@xcite system .",
    "the typical examples are staircase billiards @xcite , rational polygons @xcite and the billiards with pointlike scatterers inside an integrable one @xcite .",
    "the nature of classical motion in pseudointegrable systems can be considered as integrable in the sense that unstable trajectories are of measure zero .",
    "however , several numerical studies have revealed that under a certain condition , the quantization induces the chaotic energy spectra , which can be regarded as a counterexample for the correspondence between the energy spectra and the underlying classical motion .",
    "this phenomenon is named _ wave chaos _ because its origin is the wave - like nature of quantum motion .",
    "for the billiards with pointlike scatterers , this phenomenon has been understood in terms of the quantum breaking of the classical scale invariance @xcite .",
    "however , the notion of the pointlike scatterer is a mathematical abstraction whose relevance to the physical system is far from straightforward .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to show that the nature of wave chaos remains intact for the case of finite - size scatterer .",
    "this is the prime motivation of the work we report in this paper .",
    "we restrict ourselves to considering the billiards with a small but finite - size scatterer inside an integrable one .",
    "it is shown that , even if the scatterer has a substantial size , the signature of wave chaos are observable under a certain condition .",
    "the condition is consistent with a previous numerical observation in sinai s billiard , which indicates that there exists no signature of wave chaos when the scatterer is repulsive .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by examining the spectral properties of pseudointegrable billiards with a pointlike scatterer in secs.ii and iii . in the former section",
    ", we give an accurate description of a pointlike scatterer , based on the self - adjoint extension theory in functional analysis .",
    "a special emphasis is laid on the distinction between symmetry and self - adjointness .",
    "we give an intuitive explanation of the necessity of the self - adjointness for quantum mechanical hamiltonians .",
    "applying a general prescription for extending a symmetric operator to a self - adjoint one , we derive the green s function for the billiards with a single pointlike scatterer .",
    "a renormalized coupling constant of the scatterer is defined in a natural manner , although its physical meaning is somewhat unclear at this stage .",
    "based on the formulation in sec.ii , we discuss the quantum spectra of the billiards with a pointlike scatterer in sec.iii . the general condition for the appearance of wave chaos is clarified . in sec.iv , we consider a dirac s delta function potential with a truncated basis .",
    "although it is not well - defined with a full basis in two - dimensional billiards , we can deduce certain physical contents from the truncated system , which serve as the basis for the ensuing discussions .",
    "the findings in secs.iii and iv are applied to the cases of a small but finite - size scatterer in sec.v .",
    "it is shown that the wave chaos is manifest at low energy with attractive potentials . as an illustration",
    ", we give a numerical example for a rectangular billiard with a small rectangular scatterer inside .",
    "we also show a proper procedure for the zero - size limit of the finite - size scatterer , which is consistent with the self - adjointness of the hamiltonian .",
    "this clarifies the physical meaning of a renormalized coupling constant defined in sec.ii . we give the conclusions in sec.vi",
    "in spite of the apparent simplicity , careful treatments are required for the definition of quantum billiards with a pointlike scatterer inside .",
    "several methods are known for this purpose @xcite . here",
    ", we adopt the one based on the self - adjoint extension theory in functional analysis @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarize the formalism stressing the necessary points for the discussions in following sections .",
    "we also mention the physical reasons why quantum mechanics requires the self - adjointness for hamiltonians .",
    "let us consider an integrable billiard of area @xmath0 with the dirichlet boundary condition such that wavefunctions vanish on the boundary .",
    "the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions are determined by the stationary schrdinger equation ; @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the coordinate vector in two - dimensional space , and @xmath3 is the mass of a particle moving in the billiard .",
    "we adopt natural units throughout this paper ; @xmath4 .",
    "this leaves a single independent unit among mass , energy and length .",
    "the domain of @xmath5 is @xmath6 in terms of the sobolev spaces .",
    "( we denote the domain of the billiard by the same symbol as the area unless there is danger of confusion . ) in the following , we assume that the unperturbed billiard has no degeneracy .",
    "the green s function of this system is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an energy variable .",
    "suppose that a pointlike scatterer is placed at @xmath9 inside the billiard .",
    "following the self - adjoint extension theory in functional analysis , the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the perturbed system are calculated as follows .",
    "the first step for this purpose is to remove the relevant scattering point @xmath10 by restricting @xmath5 to @xmath11 with the domain @xmath12 by using integration by parts , it is easy to see that @xmath13 is _ symmetric ( hermitian)_. however , the domain of @xmath14 , the adjoint operator of @xmath13 , is not identical to @xmath15 and indeed larger than @xmath15 ; @xmath16 where the orthogonal complement to the range of @xmath17 corresponds to the deficiency subspace of @xmath13 given by @xcite @xmath18 with an arbitrary complex number @xmath19 ( @xmath20 .",
    "it follows from @xmath21 that @xmath13 is not _ self - adjoint_. a symmetric operator is self - adjoint if and only if @xmath22 .",
    "the two following facts serve to understand the reason for imposing self - adjointness on quantum mechanical hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "one of them is based on the assertion @xmath23 this means that @xmath14 has a complex eigenvalue @xmath24 with eigenspace @xmath25 , namely , the closure of @xmath26 . if and only if @xmath13 is self - adjoint , @xmath27 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath28 is the entire hilbert space @xmath29 , the set of all square - integrable functions over @xmath0 .",
    "this is one of the reasons why quantum mechanics , which does not allow complex eigenvalues for observables , requires self - adjoint hamiltonians .",
    "the second fact is closely related to the unitarity of time - evolution operators .",
    "the time - evolution operator @xmath30 is constructed from @xmath13 as follows ; @xmath31 it is easy to see that , for any symmetric @xmath13 , an operator @xmath32 with pure imaginary @xmath33 is defined from @xmath28 to @xmath15 with @xmath34 for any @xmath35 . if @xmath28 is not all of @xmath36 , then in general , @xmath37 can be defined on smaller and smaller spaces as @xmath38 increases .",
    "this leads us to a natural condition @xmath39 , implying that time - evolution operators which preserve probability can be constructed only from self - adjoint operators .",
    "the above considerations indicate that we have to extend @xmath15 , or equivalently , restrict @xmath40 , in order to construct a self - adjoint operator from @xmath11 .",
    "this is indeed possible since @xmath41 . because both the deficiency subspaces are one - dimensional , a one - parameter family of self - adjoint extensions of @xmath13 exist .",
    "according to a general prescription for extending a symmetric operator to self - adjoint ones @xcite , all the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath13 are given by @xmath42 @xmath43 with the domain @xmath44 eq.([6 ] ) with eq.([5 ] ) indicates that the operation of @xmath45 on @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 the operator @xmath45 is regarded as the hamiltonian of the perturbed system with a pointlike scatterer . notice that , although we have @xmath42 on @xmath15 , @xmath48 is substantially larger than @xmath15 ; @xmath49 .",
    "we recognize from the second and third terms of @xmath50 in eq.([8 ] ) that the appropriate boundary condition around the scatterer is specified after the extension .",
    "it will be shown later that the value of @xmath51 is related to the strength of the pointlike scatterer .",
    "with the aid of the resolvent equation , we can write down an equation for the green s function of the system with the hamiltonian @xmath45 as @xmath52 where the transition matrix ( t - matrix ) @xmath53 is calculated through @xmath54 after substituting eq.([2 ] ) into eq.([11 ] ) , and with a somewhat lengthy but straightforward calculation , we have @xmath55 where @xmath56 @xmath57 it follows from eq.([12 ] ) that the perturbed eigenvalues are determined by @xmath58 the solutions of this equation , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , correspond to the poles of the t - matrix .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunction is the residue of the green s function of eq.([10 ] ) at the pole ; @xmath61 where the normalization factor is determined by @xmath62 although the t - matrix seemingly has two independent parameters , @xmath19 and @xmath51 , this is not the case .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath63 is regarded as a scale of mass in case of @xmath19 being pure imaginary .",
    "indeed , taking @xmath63 as a unit of energy , we can fix @xmath64 , which makes all the relevant physical quantities to be dimensionless .",
    "such treatment is justified by the assertion that a symmetric operator @xmath13 is self - adjoint if the condition @xmath65 is valid for _ some fixed _",
    "@xmath19 @xmath66 .",
    "this means that if and only if @xmath67 , a symmetric operator @xmath13 is self - adjoint .",
    "thus , without any loss of generality , we can make the replacement of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 in eqs.([13 ] ) , ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "we then have @xmath72 where @xmath73 @xmath74",
    "we can regard @xmath75 as a coupling constant of a pointlike scatterer .",
    "it ranges over all real numbers as @xmath76 .    in a previous publication @xcite",
    ", we have referred to the coupling constant @xmath75 as the bare coupling constant , denoted by @xmath77 . however",
    ", this is somewhat confusing , because @xmath75 should be considered to arise in a renormalization process for treating short - range singularities in a proper manner , which we often encounter in field theory",
    ". it might be more appropriate to call @xmath75 the _ renormalized coupling constant_.    because the average level density of two - dimensional billiards is independent of energy @xmath8 , each term in the parenthesis of eq.([20 ] ) diverges when summed separately .",
    "the divergence disappears when summed together .",
    "this means that the second term of eq.([20 ] ) plays an essential role to make the t - matrix well - defined .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the energy dependence appears only in the first term of eq.([20 ] ) .",
    "this ensures the orthogonality of the perturbed eigenfunctions @xmath78 , @xmath60 .",
    "namely , for @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 the orthonormal relations of the unperturbed eigenfunctions @xmath81 , @xmath60 , are used in the first equality , and the second equality results from of eq.([18 ] ) .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite have discussed a rectangular billiard with a single pointlike scatterer and deduced an eigenvalue equation , eq.(23 ) in ref.@xcite , which is seemingly analogous to eq.([18 ] ) with eqs.([19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) in this paper .",
    "however , their approach allows the coupling strength @xmath82 to be varied depending on the energy , and violates the orthogonality , eq.([21 ] ) .",
    "equipped with the formulation in the previous section , we examine the spectral properties of pseudointegrable billiards with a pointlike scatterer .",
    "a special emphasis is placed on the condition for the appearance of wave chaos .",
    "an important fact is that each perturbed eigenvalue is isolated between two unperturbed ones .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath83 of eq.([20 ] ) is a monotonously decreasing function of @xmath8 on the interval between any two successive unperturbed eigenvalues , @xmath84 , covering the entire value between @xmath85 .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath83 has a single inflection point on @xmath84 .",
    "we have shown in ref.@xcite that the disturbance by the pointlike scatterer is restricted to the eigenstates with an eigenvalue around which @xmath83 has an inflection point ( see figs.2 and 3 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this is understood also from the eigenfunction , eq.([16 ] ) with eq.([2 ] ) ; if a perturbed eigenvalue is close to an unperturbed one , the corresponding perturbed eigenfunction is not substantially different from the corresponding unperturbed one .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", the condition for the inflection points has been deduced in a somewhat complicated manner , by making a truncation of the unperturbed basis according to the energy under consideration . here",
    ", we refine the argument without introducing any truncation of the basis .",
    "each inflection point of @xmath83 , say @xmath86 , @xmath87 , is expected to appear , in average , around the midpoint on @xmath88 ; @xmath89 . the contributions from @xmath90 and @xmath91 on the summation of the first term in eq.([20 ] )",
    "are canceled with high degree of accuracy .",
    "this allows us to estimate @xmath83 at the inflection point @xmath86 as follows ; @xmath92 where we define @xmath93 in terms of the average level density of the unperturbed system , @xmath94 .",
    "the symbol @xmath95 means an average among various @xmath38 . because @xmath96 according to the weyl s theorem and @xmath97 for a generic choice of @xmath98 , we obtain @xmath99 it follows from eqs.([18 ] ) and ( [ 22 ] ) that the effects of the pointlike scatterer on the quantum spectrum are observed in the eigenstates with an eigenvalue @xmath8 such that @xmath100 the condition of eq.([24 ] ) corresponds to eq.(60 ) in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is also noteworthy that a @xmath101-wave phase shift of the two - dimensional scattering problem with a single pointlike scatterer shows a similar logarithmic dependence on energy @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the origin of such energy dependence is closely related to the energy scale @xmath63 introduced by the self - adjoint extension of a symmetric operator ; any function which depends on @xmath63 has an energy dependence so as to guarantee the argument to be dimensionless .",
    "although the nature of a particle motion in billiards is independent of the energy in classical physics , the singularity of the interaction induces an energy dependence of the observables after quantization .",
    "this can be considered as a typical example of quantum mechanical breaking of scale invariance , or _",
    "scale anomaly _ @xcite .",
    "let us proceed to make an estimate of the width of a strip along the logarithmic curve of eq.([24 ] ) on which the disturbance of the scatterer is observable . using the derivative of @xmath83 at an inflection point @xmath86",
    ", we can estimate the width , say @xmath102 , as follows ; @xmath103 we have implicitly assumed in eq.([25 ] ) that the unperturbed eigenvalues are distributed within a mean interval @xmath104 in the whole energy region including negative energies .",
    "this assumption is quite satisfactory in this case , because the denominator of @xmath105 is of the order of @xmath106 , indicating that the summation in eq.([25 ] ) converges rapidly . with the aid of a relation @xmath107",
    "we arrive at @xmath108 the estimate of eq.([28 ] ) is justified from another perspective later in this paper .",
    "the above considerations lead us to the condition for the appearance of wave chaos .",
    "the effect of a pointlike scatterer with strength @xmath75 appears mainly in the eigenstates with an eigenvalue @xmath8 satisfying @xmath109 the condition of eq.([29 ] ) contains all the essential physics of wave chaos . from this",
    ", we can draw the following conclusions .",
    "\\(1 ) for any positive @xmath75 , wave chaos appears at the energy which satisfies eq.([29 ] ) , while it is hardly seen in other energies .",
    "if @xmath75 is larger than @xmath110 , wave chaos appears only around the ground state region . as the energy increases",
    ", it tends to disappear . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath75 is substantially smaller than @xmath110 , wave chaos appears in the higher energy region specified by eq.([30 ] ) . in the limit of @xmath111 ,",
    "the system restores the integrability by pushing up the chaotic region to the infinite energy .",
    "( in this limit , the eigenvalue of the single eigenstate with an eigenvalue smaller than @xmath112 diverges to @xmath113 . )",
    "\\(2 ) wave chaos does not appear at any energy if @xmath75 is negative .",
    "in particular , the system converges to the unperturbed one as @xmath114 .",
    "\\(3 ) for any @xmath75 , the system behaves as integrable in the high energy limit , which agrees with our intuition that a pointlike scatterer has no effects on a particle motion in the classical limit . in other words ,",
    "the quantum billiards with a pointlike scatterer have the nature of _ asymptotic freedom _ , which has been first discovered in the non - abelian gauge field theories .",
    "we have revealed various features of the two - dimensional billiards with a single pointlike scatterer from a general perspective in the previous section .",
    "> from a practical point of view , however , we still need to identify the physical meaning of the coupling strength @xmath75 , which does not have a direct relation to physical observables . as a first step for this purpose , we show in this section that @xmath75",
    "can be related to the physical strength of a pointlike scatterer through a truncation of the unperturbed basis .",
    "let us consider a _",
    "formal _ hamiltonian with a dirac s delta function potential @xmath115 with a truncated unperturbed basis @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "we can regard @xmath118 as the physical coupling constant of the pointlike scatterer .",
    "notice that the hamiltonian as eq.([31 ] ) can not be defined in the billiard problems with higher dimension than one because one can not take the limit of @xmath119 . for a moment , however , we will go further along with fixed @xmath120 and return to this point later in this section .",
    "the characteristic equation of @xmath121 is given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a @xmath120-dimensional unit matrix .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath124 and @xmath125 are given by @xmath126 and @xmath127 with @xmath128 , respectively .",
    "using the linearity of a determinant and noticing that any two column vectors of @xmath125 are linearly dependent , we obtain @xmath129 where @xmath130 signifies that the term of @xmath131 is removed from the product . by inserting eq.([35 ] ) into eq.([32 ] ) , the characteristic equation can be rewritten as @xmath132 where @xmath133 for any @xmath118 , eq.([36 ] ) has @xmath120 non - degenerate solutions @xmath59 , @xmath117 , giving a complete set of eigenvalues of the hamiltonian eq.([31 ] ) with the truncated basis .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunction is given by @xmath134 with the normalization factor determined by @xmath135 the eigenfunction , eq.([38 ] ) has a form analogous to eq.([16 ] ) . for large @xmath120",
    ", the appropriate boundary condition around the scatterer is taken into account in a matrix diagonalization with a dirac s delta function potential .    in an analysis similar to the previous section",
    ", we recognize that the inflection points of @xmath136 are located around @xmath137 at energy @xmath138 , implying the appearance of wave chaos under the condition of @xmath139 .",
    "we also expect that it disappears if @xmath140 . in case of @xmath141 ,",
    "the average ratio between the diagonal matrix element of the delta function potential and the mean level spacing is estimated as @xmath142 this explains the reason why the logarithmic curve of eq.([24 ] ) has a strip with width @xmath102 ; in case of @xmath140 , the physical strength @xmath118 is too weak to cause the mixing among a large number of unperturbed eigenstates . in this sense , we can regard @xmath143 as a measure of distance to the wave - chaotic curve .",
    "we stress that @xmath144 corresponds to the condition for the appearance of wave chaos in the energy region around @xmath138 . both at the lower and higher energies , the value of @xmath136 at the inflection points is substantially different from zero , since the contributions on @xmath136 from the terms with @xmath145 and those with @xmath146 do not cancel .",
    "this fact gives rise to an interesting physical result in the following section .",
    "eq.([37 ] ) allows us to relate the physical strength @xmath118 to the formal strength @xmath75 introduced in sec.ii . in a similar manner as in eq.([22 ] ) , we get for @xmath147 , @xmath148 > from eqs.([18 ] ) , ( [ 36 ] ) and ( [ 41 ] ) , we obtain the relation between both the coupling constants ; @xmath149 we note that the summation in eq.([37 ] ) diverges as @xmath120 increases for any @xmath150 .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath151 defined in eq.([23 ] ) is independent of energy @xmath8 .",
    "this underscores the fact that the dirac s delta function potential with a full unperturbed basis can not be defined in two - dimensional billiard problems , contrary to in one dimension . in the latter case , since @xmath152 , the rhs of eq.([37 ] ) converges . in this case",
    ", one can relate @xmath118 with @xmath75 through @xmath153 to make the matrix diagonalization with strength @xmath118 identical to the formulation with @xmath75 discussed in sec.ii .",
    "thus it is possible to construct quantum mechanics of one - dimensional billiards with a pointlike scatterer directly in terms of a dirac s delta function without relying on a somewhat complicated mathematical framework based on functional analysis .",
    "we finally emphasize that although the hamiltonian with a dirac s delta function potential , eq.([31 ] ) , loses its meaning in the limit of @xmath119 in two - dimensional billiards , eq.([42 ] ) is still valid for any @xmath118 , @xmath75 if @xmath147 with an arbitrarily fixed @xmath120 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the quantum spectra of the billiards with a small but finite - size scatterer .",
    "we are after the wave - chaotic spectra in the systems with a realistic finite - size scatterer inside . for this purpose , we attempt to describe the finite - size scatterer in terms of a dirac s delta function potential with a suitably truncated basis .",
    "this also enables us to recognize the physical meaning of the formal coupling constant @xmath75 . relying on the arguments in secs.iii and iv",
    ", we clarify the condition for the appearance of wave - chaotic spectra for billiards with a small scatterer .",
    "suppose that a finite - size scatterer of area @xmath154 is placed at @xmath9 inside an integrable billiard of area @xmath0 .",
    "we describe the interaction in terms of a potential with a constant strength on the domain of the scatterer ; @xmath155 where we denote the domains of the scatterer and the outer billiard by the same symbols as the areas .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath156 are given by @xmath157 if the area of the scatterer is far smaller than that of the outer billiard , the scatterer is expected to behave as pointlike at low energy because waves with long - wavelength can not see the shape of the scatterer .",
    "more precisely , the matrix element @xmath158 with @xmath159 is suitably approximated by @xmath160 .",
    "furthermore , the off - diagonal matrix elements with @xmath161 are small , because of the mismatch in the wave numbers .",
    "these indicate that the energy spectrum of the billiards with a finite - size scatterer of area @xmath154 can be reproduced by the hamiltonian eq.([31 ] ) in terms of a dirac s delta function potential with strength @xmath162 along with a restricted basis up to @xmath163 it is crucial that the zero - range approximation is justified as long as @xmath164 , even if @xmath165 is sufficiently large .",
    "the mixing among unperturbed eigenstates is limited to a small number of states even if @xmath118 ( or @xmath166 ) is sufficiently large .",
    "note also that the matrix * v * has a band - like structure , the width of which is independent of @xmath166 , but is essentially determined by @xmath154 .",
    "we can now describe the low - energy spectra of the billiards with a finite - size scatterer inside within the framework in sec.ii .",
    "it is realized from eq.([42 ] ) that , as long as @xmath164 , the eigenvalues in case of finite - size scatterer can be calculated by eq.([18 ] ) with @xmath167 the meaning of the renormalized coupling constant @xmath75 becomes clear ; a quantum billiard with a pointlike scatterer with strength @xmath75 can be obtained by taking the limit @xmath168 along with the limit @xmath169 or equivalently , with the limit @xmath170 any two sets of @xmath171 , say @xmath172 and @xmath173 , which satisfy eq.([50 ] ) with fixed @xmath75 , describe the same low - energy dynamics as long as @xmath164 , where @xmath174 .",
    "the logarithmic term in the denominator of eq.([50 ] ) expresses the reason why we can not define a pointlike scatterer in terms of a dirac s delta function in two dimension ; the limit of @xmath168 along with keeping @xmath175 constant induces a potential which is too strong to define a quantum mechanical hamiltonian for a pointlike scatterer .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the small - size limit , the strength of the scatterer is always negative in the sense that @xmath176 as @xmath168 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that a single eigenstate with an eigenvalue smaller than @xmath112 exists for any @xmath75 .",
    "we emphasize that this is not due to a specific formulation discussed here , but is required from the self - adjointness of the hamiltonian .",
    "it should be noted , however , that as long as the obstacle has a substantial size , we can deduce all the low - energy physics from the present formulation by identifying @xmath177 with @xmath75 through eq.([48 ] ) , even in the case of positive @xmath166 .    inserting eq.([48 ] ) to eq.([29 ] ) , we obtain the condition for the appearance of the wave - chaotic energy spectrum ; @xmath178 keeping eq.([23 ] ) in mind , we can rewrite eq.([51 ] ) as @xmath179 because the logarithmic function in eq.([51 ] ) is negative for @xmath180 , we obtain an interesting spectral property for lowest eigenstates ; the wave chaos is most visible when the potential is attractive . as the energy increases up to @xmath181 , the wave - chaotic region is expected to shift to @xmath182 according to eq.([51 ] ) .",
    "however , the zero - range approximation tends to lose its validity at high energy , particularly in attractive cases as shown later in the numerical calculations .",
    "the previous numerical observations of sinai s billiard give a supplementary evidence for the above finding .",
    "in ref.@xcite , berry has exhibited the energy - level diagram of sinai s billiard as a function of the radius of a circular obstacle in the billiard .",
    "it reveals that the integrability is restored in the low energy region as the radius decreases .",
    "this can be easily understood in the present scope .",
    "when the potential is repulsive , the wave chaos never appears even at low energy even if the repulsion is sufficiently strong . in spite of the infinite height of the potential in sinai s billiard , the limit of the radius being zero can be taken without any difficulty because only the ` desymmetrized states ' are considered in ref.@xcite .    in order to confirm the validity of eq.([51 ] ) , we examine the quantum spectra of a rectangular billiard with a small rectangular scatterer inside , which is analogous to the system discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the unperturbed eigenvalues and the corresponding normalized eigenfunctions of the empty billiard are given by @xmath183 and @xmath184 with @xmath185 , respectively .",
    "the side lengths of the ( outer ) rectangle are denoted by @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "suppose that a rectangular scatterer is placed inside the outer rectangle such that the sides of the inner and outer rectangles are parallel to each other .",
    "we denote the side lengths and the position of the center of the scatterer by @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "the matrix elements of the potential of eq.([44 ] ) are given by @xmath191 where @xmath192 in the actual numerical calculations , we set @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 , which leads to @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "we also assume @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 . in this choice , the area of the scatterer , @xmath154 , is @xmath201 of the outer rectangle .",
    "fig.1(a ) shows several lowest eigenvalues of this system for various values of the inverse physical strength .",
    "the circles indicate the exact eigenvalues obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix along with eq.([55 ] ) .",
    "the strength of the scatterer , @xmath166 , is determined by eq.([46 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath202 ranges from @xmath203 to @xmath204 at intervals of @xmath205 .",
    "the solid curves are the eigenvalues obtained by the approximation in terms of a dirac s delta function potential . in the latter case ,",
    "we truncate the unperturbed basis at @xmath206 , irrespective to the value of @xmath118 .",
    "this corresponds to making a truncation at the momenta @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "> from fig.1(a ) , we observe that the approximation of a zero - range potential with a suitably truncated basis is quite satisfactory , even if @xmath118 is quite large .",
    "since we have @xmath209 with @xmath197 , @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) indeed corresponds to a strong repulsion in the sense that the matrix elements of @xmath125 are far larger than @xmath212 .",
    "exceptions are the cases of a strong attractive potential . in this case",
    ", there is a considerable discrepancy between the exact and approximated eigenvalues .",
    "fig.1(b ) shows the eigenvalues for large @xmath213 .",
    "when the scatterer is attractive , there exist , in general , several eigenstates with negative eigenvalues ; for example , three eigenstates with eigenvalues @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 for @xmath217 , and four eigenstates with eigenvalues @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 for @xmath222 .",
    "( these values , particularly for shallow eigenstates are not fully convergent despite a huge matrix diagonalization with 12000 unperturbed states . )",
    "the eigenvalue of negative eigenstates is sensitive to the value of @xmath118 .",
    "this causes a rapid change of the lowest positive eigenvalues as @xmath118 varies .    as shown in fig.1(a ) , the inflection points of the solid curves in the low energy region appear in a weakly attractive region .",
    "the prediction of eq.([51 ] ) shown by a strip between two broken lines in fig.1(a ) reproduces the position of the inflection points . in fig.2",
    ", we show the contour plot of the exact eigenfunction for several eigenstates .",
    "it can be seen that the mixture of the unperturbed eigenfunctions indeed occurs around the inflections points , while the wavefunction does not differ substantially from one of the unperturbed eigenfunctions in the region far from the inflection points .",
    "we stress that , even if @xmath213 is sufficiently large , the effects of high momentum components are visible mainly in the vicinity of the scatterer .",
    "the global behavior of eigenfunctions gradually changes along the solid curves as @xmath202 varies .",
    "it is expected that , as the scatterer shrinks ( @xmath212 becomes large ) , the wave - chaotic region spreads over to higher energy . moreover , the effective strength of the scatterer becomes weaker with smaller value for @xmath213 for a fixed energy in @xmath223 , as indicated in eq.([51 ] ) .",
    "finally , we examine the validity of the zero - range approximation at higher energy .",
    "figs.3 - 5 show the eigenvalues in three cases ; @xmath224 in fig.3 , @xmath225 in fig.4 and @xmath226 in fig.5 , respectively .",
    "it is observed that the accuracy of the zero - range approximation depends on the sign of the potential . for attractive cases ,",
    "the zero - range approximation fails at somewhat low energy , as pointed out before .",
    "there is a considerable discrepancy even for @xmath227 at @xmath224 . on the other hand , for repulsive cases ,",
    "the approximated eigenvalues are in fairly good agreement with the exact eigenvalues up to @xmath225 .",
    "as the energy increases further , the zero - range approximation starts to fail except for in case of a very weak potential .",
    "it is easily recognized that the spectral properties at high energy is subject to the geometry of the scatterer , since a quantum particle moving in the billiard tends to see the shape of the scatterer as the energy increases .",
    "we have examined the quantum spectra in two - dimensional billiards with a small - size scatterer inside .",
    "first , we have clarified the spectral properties of pseudointegrable billiards with a pointlike scatterer from a general point of view .",
    "the strength of a pointlike scatterer is specified by a renormalized coupling constant @xmath75 , formally defined within the formulation based on functional analysis .",
    "although the coupling constant does not have a direct relation to physical observables , it can be related to the physical coupling constant @xmath118 defined as a strength of a dirac s delta function potential together with a truncated basis . in two - dimensional billiard problems ,",
    "the zero - range interaction can not be rigorously described in terms of a dirac s delta function .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath118 can be related to @xmath75 as long as the unperturbed basis is truncated at a finite number . from a physical perspective ,",
    "the truncation of the basis is a consequence of finiteness of the size of the scatterer , as the uncertainty principle implies . applying the findings in pseudointegrable billiards to the cases of a small but finite - size scatterer",
    ", we have shown that the signature of wave chaos in lowest eigenstates are observed most prominently when the scatterer is weakly attractive .",
    "the numerical experiments of a rectangular billiard with a small rectangular scatterer inside corroborate these arguments .",
