    "up to now the investigations at high energies were concentrated on inclusive processes , i.e. processes ( measurements ) when only one object of many produced simultaneously is recorded .",
    "naively , these processes seem to be difficult but can be well described within the standard parton model .",
    "the exclusive processes seems naively easier , but in reality require detailed knowledge of the qcd dynamics , which is not required in the inclusive case .",
    "the exclusive production was studied in detail mostly close to the kinematical thresholds .",
    "the tevatron opened a possibility to study the central ( semi)exclusive production of mesons ( elementary objects ) at high energies .",

    "these processes were discussed by a. cisek during this conference @xcite .    when going to lower energies the mechanism of the meson production becoming more complicated and the number of mechanisms increases .",

    "the amplitude of the exclusive double diffractive color singlet production @xmath2 can be written as @xcite : @xmath3 the amplitude is averaged over the color indices and over the two transverse polarizations of the incoming gluons @xcite .    in calculating the vertex @xmath4 we have included off - shellness of gluons @xcite .",
    "the unintegrated gluon distributions were taken from the literature .",
    "we have shown in ref.@xcite that for relatively light @xmath5 , unlike for the higgs boson @xcite , the dominant contributions come from the nonperturbative regions of rather small gluon transverse momenta .    in ref.@xcite we have made a detailed presentation of differential distributions . here",
    "i show only distribution in rapidity of @xmath6 ( see fig.[fig : dsig_dy ] ) .",
    "although all ugdfs give a similar quality description of the low-@xmath7 hera data for the @xmath8 structure function , they give quite different rapidity distributions of @xmath6 .",
    "the ugdfs which take into account saturation effects ( gbw , kl ) give much lower cross section than the bfkl ugdf ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "therefore the process considered here would help , at least in principle , to constrain rather poorly known ugdfs .",
    "there is interesting theoretical aspect of the double diffractive production of the @xmath9 meson .",
    "the coupling @xmath10 vanishes for on - shell gluons ( so - called landau - yang theorem ) .",
    "according to the original landau - yang theorem @xcite the symmetries under space rotation and inversion forbid the decay of the spin-1 particle into two ( on - shell ) spin-1 particles ( two photons , two gluons ) . the same is true for the fusion of two on - shell gluons .",
    "the symmetry arguments can not be strictly applied for off - shell gluons .    in ref.@xcite",
    "we have shown explicitly that the landau - yang theorem is violated by virtual effects in diffractive production of @xmath11 leading to important consequences . in our approach",

    "the cross section for the axial - vector @xmath11 production is much smaller ( about two orders of magnitude ) than the cross section for the scalar @xmath6 production .",
    "this smallness can be understood in the context of landau - yang theorem , which `` causes '' vanishing of the cross section for on - shell gluons .",
    "the @xmath1 mesons are usually measured through the observation of the @xmath13 decay channel .",
    "the axial - vector @xmath11 meson has a large branching fraction for radiative decay @xmath14 ( br = 0.36 @xcite ) .",

    "we choose post representation of the phenomenological exchange interaction , i.e. interaction for energy in the corresponding final state subsystem . above @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the center - of - mass energy in the ( i , k ) subsystem .",
    "more details of the calculation will be presented elsewhere @xcite . the @xmath37 amplitude ( [ regge_amplitude ] )",
    "is used to calculate the corresponding cross section including limitations of the four - body phase - space .      here",
    "i show only one example of the two - dimensional distribution in rapidity of positively charged pion and rapidity of negatively charged pion at the lhc energy of @xmath39 14 tev .",
    "the distribution differs considerably from the uniform population of the phase space .",
    "one can see a two - dimensional shape of the ridge form elongated along the line @xmath40 .",
    "the minimum of the cross section on the top of the ridge occurs when @xmath41 and two maxima close to the phase space ends .",
    "the minimum occurs in the part of the phase space where the pomeron - pomeron contribution dominates , i.e. when both @xmath36 are comparable and large . the maxima are related to the dominance of the pomeron - reggeon and reggeon - pomeron mechanisms , i.e. where one of @xmath36 is small and the second one is large .",
    "the reggeon - reggeon contribution is completely negligible which is due to the fact that both @xmath36 can not be small simultaneously .",
    "the alice collaboration at the lhc should be able to measure such distributions .",
    "exclusive production of elementary particles ( lepton pairs , higgs , etc . ) or mesons ( vector mesons , pair of pseudoscalar mesons , etc . ) in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions is an interesting and quickly growing field @xcite of theoretical investigation . on experimental side",

    "so far only single-@xmath43 exclusive cross section @xmath44 was measured @xcite .",
    "let us consider the process @xmath42 depicted in fig.[fig : diagram ] .",
    "the cross section takes the familiar form of a convolution of equivalent photon fluxes and @xmath45cross sections .",
    "often flux factors of equivalent , almost on - shell , photons are calculated as for point - like particles with rescaled charge @xmath46 , and the total cross section is calulated using a simple parton ",
    "model type formula : @xmath47 the formulae ( [ epa_formula ] ) clearly does not take into account absorption effects when initial nuclei undergo nuclear breakup . this can be done in the impact parameter space where the geometry of the collision is explicit .",
    "then rather two - dimensional flux factors @xcite must be used .    the simple epa formula can be generalized to @xmath48 here the extra @xmath49 function excludes those cases when nuclear collisions , leading to nuclear disintegration , take place ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the two - dimensional fluxes in ( [ bspace_epa_formula ] ) are calculated in terms of the charge form factor of nucleus @xcite as : @xmath51 where the auxiliary function @xmath52 reads : @xmath53 the second ingredient of our approach is the @xmath54 cross section .",
