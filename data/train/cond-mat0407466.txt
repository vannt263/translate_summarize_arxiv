    "the properties of ridges have been studied thoroughly . scaling laws governing the energy and size of the ridge",
    "have been obtained analytically and tested numerically [ 6 - 9 ] .",
    "point - like singularities are also studied extensively [ 1 - 4 , 11 , 12 , 16 , 17 ] , however , current understanding of their properties is not as complete as that of ridges .    in this paper , we consider a single conical vertex studied by cerda _",
    "et al _ [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "one experimental realization is to push the center of a circular elastic sheet of radius @xmath5 axially into a cylindrical container of radius @xmath4 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ shape ] .",
    "this is the simplest volume - restricting deformation of the sheet and causes the center of the sheet to move into the container by a distance @xmath0 .",
    "it is useful to express the deflection of the sheet by @xmath6 . due to the constraint of unstretchability , the sheet deforms into a non - axisymmetric conical surface which is only in partial contact with the edge of the container . in the limit",
    "that thickness @xmath3 of the sheet goes to zero , since bending modulus ( @xmath7 ) vanishes faster than the stretching modulus ( @xmath8 ) , there would be pure bending over the sheet and gaussian curvature would be zero everywhere .",
    "mathematically , such a conical surface is called perfectly developable cone @xcite ( @xmath0-cone ) . in this limit , some models about the shape of the @xmath0-cone have been proposed [ 2 - 4 , 17 ] .",
    "these models only give outer region solutions of @xmath0-cone shape , in the sense that they do not consider the stretching energy that is inevitable on a real sheet with finite thickness . for a real sheet , it must stretch near the tip , because otherwise , the curvature at the tip would be divergent , since curvature goes as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the distance to the tip , thus causing divergent energy .",
    "therefore , it is the finite thickness that causes the sheet to stretch greatly in a small region near the tip .",
    "this small region is called the core region .",
    "it is where energetically expensive stretching is localized and its size is governed by the competition of the bending and stretching energies of the whole cone . as a result of the stress focusing in the core region ,",

    "we want to know whether there is scaling behavior of core size and to determine any scaling exponents .",
    "intuitively , we expect that this size @xmath1 should have a dependence on thickness @xmath3 , since @xmath1 goes to zero as @xmath3 goes to zero",

    "this says that besides @xmath3 , the supporting container radius @xmath4 also determines @xmath1 .",
    "this is surprising because stretching energies are supposed to be localized in the core region , so the core should not be able to know about the length of outside container radius . in this work",

    "we begin by stating the connection between the deformation of the sheet and its elastic energy . in a thin @xmath0-cone",
    "the dominant energy is due to the bending distortion in outer region far from the crescent .",
    "we discuss the form of this energy and the stresses associated with it .",
    "next we outline the energetic effects of the crescent region .",
    "finally , we focus on how each of these energies is influenced by a change in the crescent radius @xmath1 .",
    "we sketch how scaling properties of the energy produce scaling behavior in the sheet .",
    "we first specify two coordinate systems .",
    "we define @xmath17 as the horizontal plane of the supporting cylindrical container s edge , with origin on the axis of cylinder and @xmath18 axis pointing upward ( see fig .  [ shape ] ) .",

    "asymptotic @xmath0-cone_.    in equilibrium , the sheet assumes a conformation that minimizes the elastic energy .",
    "thus , the actual core radius is that which minimizes this energy .",
    "two forms of energy must be considered , bending energy @xmath25 and stretching energy @xmath26 .",
    "the bending energy density is proportional to the square of the total curvature @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath27 defined as the trace of the curvature tensor , is sometimes called the mean curvature @xcite .",
    "the constant of proportionality is called the bending modulus @xmath28 .",
    "thus b = d a  c(r)^2  , where @xmath29 denotes the integral over the surface . in general there is a second form of bending energy , proportional to the average gaussian curvature .",
    "we show later in this section that this gaussian curvature energy is unimportant for the present system .",
    "the stretching energy density is proportional to the square of the strain tensor @xmath30 .",
    "for an isotropic material , there are two forms of stretching energy with constants of proportionality @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite s = d a  , where @xmath33 is young s modulus , and @xmath34 is a convenient combination of @xmath33 and dimensionless poisson s ratio @xmath35 .",
    "they are related to bending modulus through @xmath36 .",
    "the actual strain and curvature fields are those which minimize the @xmath37 .",
    "the variational minimization amounts to a statement that the normal forces on each element must balance .",
    "this statement is known as the  force von  equation \" _ _ m _ = _ c_+ p  , [ forcevon ] where @xmath38 are torques per unit length , @xmath39 are in - plane stresses , and @xmath40 is external force per unit area of the sheet .    when we push a circular sheet of radius @xmath5 into a container to form a @xmath0-cone , strain and curvature distortions are created and elastic energy is stored .",
    "this energy arises from several effects .",
    "it is convenient to discuss it by creating the final surface in two stages . in the first stage , we assume a value for @xmath1 and cut a circular hole of that radius in the center of the sheet .",
    "we then force this perforated sheet into the container by exerting tension on the inner edge of the hole . in the unstretchable limit , @xmath41 ,",
    "this shape becomes a truncated @xmath0-cone , which serves as the outer region of a regular @xmath0-cone . in this region ,",
    "the curvature at every point vanishes in the radial direction .",
    "the total curvature @xmath42 has the form @xmath43 .",
    "its bending energy @xmath44 is thus given by b_0 = _ r_c^r_p r dr / r^2 d^2 ( ) ( r / r_c )  .",
    "in the limit @xmath45 , this @xmath44 dominates the energy , as we justify below .",
    "then the function @xmath46 takes the form that minimizes @xmath44 subject to the constraints on the @xmath0-cone . in this geometry",
    ", the force von  equation simplifies greatly , and the form of @xmath47 as well as the associated stresses can be found explicitly @xcite@xcite .",

    "the nonzero components of torque tensor @xmath49 follow from the constitutive law implicit in the energy equations @xcite : @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    ", there is no pressure from external force acting on the sheet , i.e. @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , according to eq .",
    "( [ strain ] ) , stress @xmath48 goes as @xmath56 .",
    "these stresses arise from the requirement that the normal force due to changing torques is balanced by the normal force due to in - plane tension of the sheet .",
    "we call them type i stresses and denote them by symbol @xmath57 .",
    "on the other hand , we consider the force balance of a region that encloses area between inner radius @xmath1 and outer radius @xmath10 , where @xmath10 can take values between @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "the tension exerted on the inner edge of this region is equivalent to the central pushing force of a regular @xmath0-cone .",
    "this force must be balanced by the force due to radial in - plane stress @xmath58 on the outer perimeter of the region .",
    "let @xmath59 be the angle between a radial line or generator of the @xmath0-cone and the horizontal .",
    "since @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 . the balance of vertical forces yields _ rr r d = f  , [ above ] which holds for every value of @xmath10 from @xmath1 to @xmath4 .",
    "it is easy to see that type i stresses alone ca nt satisfy this equation , since type i stresses go as @xmath62 , they would give a @xmath9 prefactor on the left side of equation , while the right - side of equation is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the integral from type i stresses must vanish and there must exist some additional stresses in the outer region that scale as @xmath9 to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ above ] ) .",
    "we call these stresses as type ii stresses and denote them by @xmath63 .",
    "they persist up to the supporting container edge , where normal force from the container counteracts the external pushing force .",
    "we can write @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a function only of @xmath53 and satisfies @xmath66 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath65 is of order unity .    to estimate the magnitude of type ii stresses , we notice that @xmath67 .",
    "thus @xmath68 .",
    "the type ii stresses are comparable with type i stresses only near the container edge since the ratio @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "it is noted that they are both due to nonzero thicknesses . since in - plane",
    "stress tensors are related to strain tensors through @xcite @xmath71(\\gamma_{\\alpha \\beta } + \\nu \\epsilon_{\\alpha \\rho } \\epsilon_{\\beta \\tau } \\gamma_{\\rho \\tau})$ ] , we have strains @xmath72 .",
    "the stretching energy of truncated @xmath0-cone is then s_0 h^-2 ( ( ^(1 ) + ^(2))/(yh))^2 r dr d h^2/r_c^2  .",
    "[ outs ]    we now examine the profile of external force along the container edge . here the external normal force pressure @xmath40 of eq .",
    "( [ forcevon ] ) is nonvanishing .",
    "this normal force causes a small transverse deflection of the sheet and hence induces both curvature and strain near the edge .",
    "noticing that the curvature induced is in radial direction and has opposite sign with @xmath54 , we expect mean curvature to be reduced near the edge . due to the translational symmetry along the region of the surface in contact with the cylindrical container ,",
    "the normal force pressure is found to be independent of azimuthal angle @xmath53 .",
    "however , besides this @xmath53-independent term , cerda and mahadevan @xcite show that a @xmath73-function term of @xmath53 emerges in the normal force pressure expression in order to make the torque balance , and this singularity happens at the take - off angular positions , where the sheet begins to bend away from the container . since stresses and curvatures should avoid singular behavior for the sake of energy , according to eq .",
    "( [ strain ] ) , there must exist a @xmath73-function term in @xmath74 to cancel that from normal force pressure @xmath40 . integrating over @xmath53 , we conclude that @xmath75 should have a jump at the take - off positions .",
    "this result is consistent with the geometrical requirement .",

    ", we obtain the value of this ratio 0.69 .",
    "we will numerically verify this ratio later .",
    "having discussed stresses and forces , we now consider in detail the bending energy @xmath44 . bending energy comes from both total curvature and gaussian curvature .",
    "since the truncated @xmath0-cone has no gaussian curvature , we only need to take account of the total curvature contribution .",
    "the reduced curvature @xmath47 is related to the reduced height @xmath79 defined in the beginning of this section : @xmath80 . for small to moderate deformations of the sheet ( @xmath81 ) ,",
    "@xmath82 . throughout the paper",
    "we shall focus on this moderate range of @xmath83 .",
    "the bending energy @xmath44 has the form b_0 = c^2 da g_1 ^2  , [ outerbending ] where @xmath84 is a geometrical factor . comparing this with @xmath85 from eq .",
    "( [ outs ] ) , we see that bending dominates the outer region .",
    "although gaussian curvature is zero everywhere in a truncated @xmath0-cone , it is certainly not the case for a regular @xmath0-cone .",
    "the gaussian curvature contribution to the bending energy is @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is gaussian curvature coefficient , @xmath88 is gaussian curvature and @xmath89 is the area . according to the gauss - bonnet theorem , the integral of gaussian curvature over a region @xmath49 of a surface is related @xcite to the integral of the geodesic curvature @xmath90 over the boundary of that region through @xmath91 .",
    "choosing @xmath49 to be the whole sheet without perforation , we get @xmath92 . if the sheet were a perfectly developable conical surface , the geodesic curvature at the perimeter would be the same as that of a regular cone of same size : @xmath93 , where @xmath5 is the perimeter - to - tip distance .",
    "however , due to stretching of the real sheet and the pushing of container edge , the shape is not perfectly developable so there are variations in the perimeter - to - tip distances along the boundary , which make @xmath90 deviate from @xmath94 .",
    "since stretching is small compared with bending and the sheet is nearly developable over most of the surface , this deviation is small compared with @xmath94 , and it should depend on thickness @xmath3 . we suppose that @xmath90 is a regular function of @xmath3 , and may be expressed @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is a dimensionless function of @xmath53 and @xmath83 . substituting this into the equation for bending energy",

    "one obvious addition is the bending energy @xmath102 due to gaussian curvature discussed above .",

    "thus it is important to revisit this scaling argument and show how the contradiction with our result arises .",
    "the authors attribute the scaling to an energy balance between bending and stretching in the core region . to estimate the stretching energy , they consider a director traversing the sheet from one edge , through the core and on to the opposite edge , such as the dashed line in fig . [",

    "this argument seems questionable , since it ignores energies much larger than the ones it includes .",
    "its assumption of uniform strain leads to an stretching energy of uniform density outside as well as within the core .",
    "the argument includes that part of this energy lying within the core while ignoring the much larger part outside the core .",
    "if one tries to repair the estimate by supposing the excess length resides only in the core , then the strain becomes independent of @xmath4 and the @xmath1 must be independent of @xmath4 .",
    "in addition the argument ignores the large stretching energy in the core arising from the necessary gaussian curvature within the core itself , as discussed above .",
    "likewise , it takes no account of the strong difference between the two principal curvatures in the crescent .",
    "our analysis of the energy given above allows us to infer the scaling of @xmath1 based on measurements of the central pushing force , @xmath11 .",
