    "the iras revised bright galaxy sample by sanders et al .",
    "( 2003 ) includes all galaxies with total 60 @xmath6 flux density greater than 5.24 jy .",
    "the sample is the result of a highly complete flux - limited survey conducted by iras covering the entire sky at galactic latitudes @xmath7 and was compiled after the final calibration of the iras level 1 archive .",
    "it offers far more accurate and consistent measurements of the flux of objects with extended emission .",
    "in addition , the infrared fluxes of over 100 sources from the sample were recalculated by the iras high resolution ( hires ) processing , which allowed the deconvolution of close galaxy pairs ( surace , sanders , mazzarela 2004 ) .",
    "the latter provides a more - than - ever reliable database of the iras galaxies which can be proved crucial for statistical studies like this one .    while the relation between ultra luminous iras galaxies ( ulirgs ) and strong interactions has been thoroughly studied ( e.g. sanders , surace & ishida 1999 , wang et al .",
    "2006 ) , this is not the case for the environment of moderately and low luminous infrared galaxies . a 2-dimensional analysis of krongold et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed a trend for a bright iras galaxy ( birg ) sample on having neighbors in excess of normal galaxies and sy1 galaxies , but in relative agreement with sy2 galaxies .",
    "however , the birg population consists of various types of active galaxies , including starbursts ( the majority ) , seyferts , liners and normal galaxies and thus it would be of great interest to clarify the connection between infrared emission , interactions and different types of active galaxies .    during the last decade , many studies have investigated the relation among interacting galaxies , starbursting and nuclear activity ( eg .",
    "hernandez - toledo et al .",
    "2001 ; ho 2005 ) . despite the plethora of available information , searches for correlations between the above physical processes are inconclusive , the only exception being the coupling between interactions and starbursting",
    "however , there is evidence that agn galaxies host a post - starburst stellar population ( eg .",
    "boisson et al .",
    "2000 , gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "2001 ) while kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that the fraction of post - starburst stars increases with agn emission .",
    "proving a relation of this type between starburst and agn galaxies would simultaneously solve also the problem of the agn triggering mechanism .",
    "interactions would be the main cause of such activities , being starbursting and/or the feeding of a central black hole . however , this is not a trivial task .",
    "the main difficulty arises from the fact that the star formation rate ( sfr ) estimation in agn host galaxies is still problematic .",
    "all sfr estimation methods present complications and even those based on the fir continuum are doubtful , since the contribution of the active nuclei is unknown ( eg . ho 2005 ) .    despite the difficulties , some studies , based on different diagnostics seem to conclude that there is indeed an evolutionary sequence from starburst to type 2 and then to type 1 agn galaxies ( e.g. oliva et al .",
    "1999 , krongold et al .",
    "in addition , kim , ho and i m ( 2006 ) , using the [ oii ] emission line as a sfr indicator , reach the conclusion that type 2 are the precursors of type 1 quasars supporting the previous claims .",
    "these studies are based on the observed differences between different types of agns and resemblance of type 2 objects to starbursts .",
    "this raises doubts about the simplest version of the unification scheme of agns .",
    "it is true that the recent discovery of 10@xmath6 silicate emission in two luminous quasars implies the presence of dust , but it is not clear yet what is the spatial distribution of this material ( siebenmorgen et al .",
    "in addition , silicate emission is not yet detected in other type 1 objects and thus more observations are needed to establish the existence of the dusty torus .",
    "we can summarize all the previous in two statements : ( 1 ) the starburst - agn connection is still not well established and ( 2 ) the agn unification model , although successful in interpreting many observational facts , remains fragile . from our point of view , our birg sample offers a homogeneous and complete database , which is ideal for a statistical study on these issues",
    ".    we will discuss our galaxy samples in section  2 .",
    "our data analysis and results will be presented in  3 , while in section  4 we will discuss our results and present our conclusions . due to the fact that all our samples are local , cosmological corrections of galaxy distances are negligible . throughout our paper",
    "we use @xmath8 mpc .",
    "the bright iras sample consists of 87 objects with redshifts between 0.008 and 0.018 and was compiled from the birg survey by soifer et al .",
    "( 1989 ) for the northern hemisphere and by sanders et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the southern .",
    "it includes only high galactic latitude objects ( @xmath9 ) in order to avoid extinction and confusion with galactic stars .",
    "all objects lay in the luminosity range of @xmath10 .",
    "this sample is volume limited and a @xmath11 test gives a value of @xmath12 . since the birg survey is highly complete , this sample is expected to be as well .",
    "more details about the sample selection are given in krongold et al .",
    "in addition we have refined the bright iras sample by correcting the infrared fluxes using  the iras revised bright galaxy sample \" by sanders et al .",
    "furthermore for interacting galaxies we used the corrected fluxes given by surace , sanders and mazzarella ( 2004 ) .",
    "we also use the control sample , compiled by krongold et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in such a way as to reproduce the main characteristics , other than the infrared emission , of the bright iras sample .",
    "specifically , the control sample was compiled from the original cfa catalog to reproduce closely the redshift , morphological type and diameter size distributions of the corresponding iras sample .",
    "in other words , the selection of the iras sample and its corresponding control sample is exactly the same , the only difference being the infrared luminosity .",
    "this is very important in order to validate that any possible environmental effect is related to the mechanisms that produce the observed high infrared luminosity and not to possible differences in the host galaxies or sample biases .    in table 1",
    "we present the names , celestial coordinates , zwicky magnitudes , redshifts nearest neighbor projected linear distance and spectral types of our final list of bright iras galaxies .      in order to investigate the local and large scale environment around our birg and control sample galaxies we use the cfa2 and ssrs galaxy catalogues which cover a large solid angle of the sky .",
    "although these galaxy catalogues date from the 80 s and 90 s they still provide an important database for studies of the properties of galaxies and their large - scale distribution in the nearby universe . we briefly present the main characteristics of these catalogues .    the cfa2 redshift catalog contains approximately 18000 galaxy redshifts in the northern sky down to a magnitude limit of @xmath1315.5 ( huchra 1990 ) .",
    "the magnitude system used is the merging of the original zwicky magnitudes and the more accurate rc1 @xmath14 magnitudes .",
    "these exhibit a scatter of @xmath15 mags ( eg .",
    "bothun & cornell 1990 ) .",
    "following huchra ( 1990 ) , we do not attempt to translate these magnitudes to a standard photometric system since this requires accurate knowledge of the morphological type and size of each individual galaxy .    the ssrs catalog ( da costa et al .",
    "1998 ) contains redshifts , @xmath16 magnitudes and morphological classifications for @xmath175400 galaxies in two regions covering a total of 1.70 steradians in the southern celestial hemisphere and it is more than 99% complete down to @xmath18 = 15.5 .",
    "the galaxies have positions accurate to about 1 arcsec and magnitudes with an rms scatter of about 0.3 mag .",
    "the radial velocity precision is of @xmath17 40 km / s .",
    "note that in the regions covered by the ssrs and cfa2 catalogues , only a subsample of the original birgs and their control samples can be found ( 76 bright iras galaxies and 61 control galaxies ) . in order to test whether these subsamples are statistically equivalent with their parent samples ( ie .",
    ", their diameter , morphological type and redshift distributions ) we used the kolmogorov - smirnov two - sample test .",
    "we verified that the null hypothesis , the subsamples being equivalent with their parent samples , can not be rejected at any significant statistical level .      in order to cover a larger magnitude difference between the birgs and their nearest neighbor than that imposed by the cfa2/ssrs magnitude limit ( @xmath19 ) we have obtained our own spectroscopic observations of fainter neighbors around a subsample of our birgs , consisting of 24 galaxies ( selected randomly from their parent sample ) . around each birg we have obtained spectra of all neighboring galaxies within a projected radius of 100 @xmath2 kpc and a magnitude limit of @xmath20 .",
    "our aim with this new fainter neighbor search is not to establish or not the existence of close neighbors around the birgs .",
    "this will be done by using the brighter ssrs and cfa2 catalogues , at the magnitude limit of which we have well defined control samples .",
    "what we seek with these observations is to facilitate a comparison with a similar analysis of seyfert galaxies by koulouridis et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , in which sy2 s were found to have significantly higher fraction of neighbors with respect to sy1 s . in other words",
    "we wish to establish whether the fractional differences in - between the sy1 , sy2 and birg samples of galaxies , already determined ( or not ) as significant with respect to their control samples , continue to fainter magnitudes .",
    "optical spectroscopy was carried out using the faint object spectrograph and camera ( lfosc ) ( zickgraf et al . 1997 ) mounted on the 2.1 m guillermo haro telescope in cananea , operated by the national institute of astrophysics , optics and electronics ( inaoe ) of mexico .",
    "a setup covering the spectral range @xmath21  with a dispersion of 8.2 / pix was adopted .",
    "the effective instrumental spectral resolution was about 18 .",
    "the data reduction was done using the iraf packages and included bias and flat field corrections , cosmic ray cleaning , wavelength linearization , and flux transformation .    in table 2",
    "we present the birg name , coordinates , redshift and magnitude for this subsample of birgs . below the row of each birg",
    "we list the corresponding data for all its neighbors , within a projected separation of 100 @xmath2 kpc . since zwicky magnitudes were not available for the fainter neighbors and in order to provide a homogeneous magnitude system for all the galaxies we decided to list in table 2 the @xmath22 magnitudes ( blue ) poss i plate magnitudes of the minnesota automated plate scanner ( maps ) system . ] for all galaxies , being the central birg or their neighbors ( see http://aps.umn.edu/docs/photometry ) .",
    "the neighbor measured redshift is presented in the fifth column ( while in some very few cases we list the redshift from the ned ) .",
    "the uncertainties listed are estimated from the redshift differences which result from using different emission lines .",
    "we search for the nearest neighbor around each birg and control galaxy in our samples with the aim of estimating the fraction of birg and normal galaxies that have a close neighbor .",
    "to define the neighborhood search we use two parameters , the projected linear distance ( @xmath23 ) and the radial velocity separation ( @xmath24 ) between the central birg and the neighboring galaxies found in the cfa2 and ssrs catalogues or in our own spectroscopic observations .",
    "we search for neighbors with @xmath25 600 km / s , which is roughly the mean galaxy pairwise velocity of the cfa2 and ssrs galaxies or about twice the mean pairwise galaxy velocity when clusters of galaxies are excluded ( marzke et al .",
    "note however that our results remain robust even for @xmath25 1000 km / s .",
    "we then define the fraction of birg and normal galaxies that have their nearest neighbor within the selected @xmath24 separation , as a function of increasing @xmath23 .      in figure 1 ( upper panels ) we plot the fraction of birg and control galaxies as a function of the projected distance ( @xmath23 ) of the first companion and for two velocity separations ( @xmath27 km / s and @xmath28 km / s ) . for comparison",
    "we also plot the results of a similar analysis by koulouridis et al .",
    "( 2006 ) concerning seyfert galaxies and their control samples .",
    "it is evident that a significantly higher fraction of birg galaxies have a near neighbor within @xmath29 h@xmath30 kpc with respect to their control sample . in koulouridis",
    "et al . ( 2006 ) we found that there is a significantly higher fraction of sy2 galaxies ( @xmath17 27% ) having a near neighbor within @xmath31 h@xmath30 kpc with respect to both their control sample and the sy1 galaxies ( @xmath17 14% ) . adding here the birg sample , which includes mostly starburst and sy2 galaxies ( see table 1 ) , we can clearly see that an even higher fraction of birgs ( @xmath17 42% ) tend to have a close companion within @xmath31 h@xmath30 kpc .",
    "the latter needs a further explanation since it is not consistent with most starburst - agn connection scenarios , which suggest a simultaneous creation of starburst and sy2 nuclei triggered by interactions .    in order to investigate whether fainter neighbors , than those found in the relatively shallow cfa2 and",
    "ssrs catalogues , exist around our birgs , we have performed a spectroscopic survey of all neighbors with @xmath32 ( @xmath333 magnitudes fainter than the cfa2 and ssrs limits ) .",
    "this limit translates into an absolute magnitude limit of m@xmath3415.2 for the most distant objects in our sample ( z@xmath35 ) .",
    "this magnitude is fainter even than that of the small magellanic cloud .",
    "here we present results of our spectroscopic observations of all the neighbors with @xmath36 kpc and @xmath37 for the subsample of 24 birg galaxies ( see table 2 ) .",
    "we find that in total 13 out of the 24 birgs have at least one close neighbor within the above limits , with 9 of these having neighbors already detected in the ssrs and cfa2 catalogues , ie .",
    ", only 4 birgs have fainter than @xmath38 neighbors .",
    "this implies that the birgs having a close neighbor ( within @xmath36 kpc and for @xmath39 km / s ) increases only by @xmath1745% when going fainter .",
    "koulouridis et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that the percentage of both sy1 and sy2 galaxies that have a close neighbor ( within the above limits ) increases correspondingly by about 100% when we descent from @xmath40 to @xmath37 ( but remember that the host galaxies have magnitudes slightly closer to the cfa2 and ssrs limit ) . in detail , while the percentage of sy1 and sy2 galaxies having a close neighbor increases from 14% to 27% and from 27% to 55% respectively , for birgs it increases from 42% to 54% , reaching the equivalent sy2 levels .",
    "we summarize that birgs , with respect to their control sample , show an excess of close neighbors which therefore should be responsible for their excess fir emission .",
    "these results confirm a previous 2-dimensional analysis of krongold et al .",
    "( 2002 ) of the same birg sample .",
    "since the fractions of both birgs and sy2s that have a close neighbor is roughly the same , an interesting question is whether there are any magnitude differences between hosts and neighbors for the birgs and the sy2s . in figure 2",
    "we present the distribution of such magnitude differences ( @xmath41 ) between hosts and nearest neighbor for the birgs and the sy2s . although there appears to be a slight preference for brighter neighbors of the birgs with respect to the sy2s , the two distributions are statistically equivalent , as quantified by a k - s test which gives a probability of them being drawn from the same parent population of @xmath42 .      here",
    "we investigate whether there are differences in the large scale environment of birgs with respect to their control galaxies and to the sy1 and sy2 samples of koulouridis et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . to this end",
    "we determine the galaxy overdensity , based on the cfa2 and ssrs catalogues , in a region around each birg or control sample galaxy .",
    "we count all neighboring galaxies around each galaxy within a projected radius of 1 @xmath2 mpc , while to take into account the galaxy peculiar velocities , we use a radial velocity separation of @xmath43 km / s",
    ".    we estimate the expected cfa2 and ssrs field galaxy density , @xmath44 , at the distance of each galaxy by integrating the corresponding cfa2 or ssrs luminosity function ( marzke , huchra & geller 1994 ; da costa et al .",
    "1994 ) using as a lower integration limit the minimum galaxy luminosity that corresponds to the galaxy catalogue magnitude limit ( ie . ,",
    "@xmath45 ) at that distance .",
    "we then compute the local overdensity around each agn , within the previously mentioned cylinder , which is given by : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 with @xmath48 the number of neighbors and @xmath49 the corresponding volume of the cylinder .    in figure 3",
    "we plot the overdensity frequency distribution for the birgs ( left panel ) and the corresponding distribution of their control galaxy sample . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the distributions for the seyfert galaxies of koulouridis et al .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that there is no statistically significant difference between any active galaxy sample ( birg or seyfert ) and their respective control sample distribution .    however , there is a statistically significant difference , at a 0.03 and 0.09 level , between the overdensity distributions of birgs - sy1s and sy1s - sy2s , respectively .",
    "similar , differences are also found between their respective control samples . on the other hand the corresponding distributions of birgs and sy2s ( and of their control samples )",
    "are statistically equivalent at a 0.9 level .",
    "this implies that the large scale environment of birgs and sy2s is similar but significantly different to that of sy1s , a difference which since it is also seen in their corresponding control samples should be attributed to differences of the host galaxies .",
    "indeed , sy1 hosts are earlier type galaxies ( e.g. , hunt & malkan 1999 , koulouridis et al .",
    "2006 ) which are known to be more clustered than late types ( e.g. , willmer et al . 1998 ) .      in these section",
    "we investigate whether there is relation between the strength of the interaction of birgs with their closest neighbor and their fir characteristics .",
    "the strength of any interaction could be parametrized as a function of the distance between the birg and its first neighbor . at this first order analysis",
    "we do not take into account the magnitude difference between birgs and their close neighbor , which as we have shown previously ( see figure 2 ) , does not appear to be significantly differ from that of sy2 galaxies .",
    "we divided the interactions in our sample into three categories based on the proximity of the first neighbor .",
    "we consider strong interactions when @xmath50 , weak interactions when @xmath51 and no interaction when @xmath52 .    in figure 4 we present the color - color diagram of @xmath53 versus @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the spectral index defined as @xmath56 with @xmath57 the flux in janskys at wavelength @xmath58 .",
    "we can clearly see the differences between the fir characteristics among different types of galaxies and different interaction strengths .",
    "the different interaction strengths are coded by different types of symbols while the different activity is color coded as indicated in the caption of the figure .",
    "we cross - identified classifications of each birg combining various studies like : the pico dos dias survey ( coziol et al . 1998 ) , optical spectroscopy of luminous infrared galaxies ( veilleux et al .",
    "1997 ; ho , filippenko , sargent 1995 ) , cola  radio and spectroscopic diagnostics of nuclear activity in galaxies ( corbett et al .",
    "2002 ) , warm iras sources ( de grijp et al . 1987 ) and , when available , sdss spectroscopic data .",
    "it is evident that the fir characteristics of starburst galaxies in our birg sample differ significantly depending on the strength of the interaction .",
    "the majority of highly interacting starburst have @xmath53 spectral indices greater than -2 , while all , except one , non - interacting starbursts have less .",
    "we also find that normal galaxies and liners are at the lower end of this sequence .",
    "the only highly - interacting starburst galaxy below @xmath59 is ngc7541 which happens to have more than two times the typical molecular gas mass of birgs ( mirabel & sanders 1988 ) .",
    "the difference between highly interacting and non - interacting starburst galaxies , as quantified by a k - s test , is significant at a @xmath60 level when comparing their @xmath53 index distribution .",
    "however , sy2 galaxies , interacting or no , seem to lay in the same area ( @xmath61 ) with non - interacting starburst galaxies , delineated in figure 4 by blue dashed lines .",
    "the fir color analysis of our sample strengthens our previous results .",
    "it clearly shows that the starburst activity is higher when interactions are stronger and ceases when the interacting neighboring galaxy moves away . while the starburst activity weakens ( if we link position on the plot with time ) sy2 nuclei appear , giving further evidence on the causal bridging between these objects .",
    "we have compared the 3-dimensional environment of a sample of local birgs with that of a well defined control sample , selected in such a way as to reproduce the redshift , morphological type and diameter size distributions of the birg sample .",
    "we searched for close neighbors around each birg and control sample galaxy using the distribution of cfa2 and ssrs galaxy catalogues as well as our own spectroscopic observations reaching a fainter magnitude limit ( but for a restricted birg subsample ) .",
    "we also compared our results with those of a similar analysis of seyfert galaxies ( dultzin - hacyan et al .",
    "1999 ; koulouridis et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we find that the fraction of birg galaxies having a close neighbor , within a projected separation of 75 @xmath2 kpc and radial velocity difference of @xmath39 km / s , is significantly higher than the corresponding fraction of its control sample and that of sy1 galaxies while it is comparable to that of sy2 galaxies .",
    "this result is in accordance with some previous two - dimensional studies ( eg .",
    "krongold et al .",
    "we reach similar results regarding the large scale environment of birgs ( within a projected radial separation of 1 @xmath2 mpc and a radial velocity difference @xmath43 km / s ) .",
    "once more their behavior resembles that of sy2 s but not of sy1 s .",
    "we also find a statistically significant difference between highly - interacting and non - interacting birgs , based on their fir color properties .",
    "sy2s appear to display a similar behavior to that of non - interacting starburst galaxies , introducing new evidence for the starburst / agn connection scenarios .",
    "our results can be accommodated in a simple evolutionary scenario , starting with an interaction , and ending in a sy1 phase .",
    "first , close interactions would drive molecular clouds towards the central area , creating a circumnuclear starburst .",
    "then , material could fall even further into the innermost regions of the galaxy , feeding the black hole , and giving birth to an agn which at first can not be observed due to obscuration . at this stage",
    "only a starburst would be observed . as starburst activity relaxes and obscuration decreases , a sy2 nucleus",
    "would be revealed ( still obscured by the molecular clouds from all viewing angles ) . as a final stage",
    ", a sy1 phase could appear . in this case , the molecular clouds , initially in a spheroidal distribution , could flatten and form a `` torus '' ( as in the unification scheme for seyferts ) . as more material is accreted , it is possible that the agn strengthens driving away most of the obscuring clouds , and leaving a `` naked '' sy1 nuclei .",
    "if indeed interactions play a role in triggering activity , as suggested by the above picture , then the lack of close companions among sy1 galaxies implies that the time needed for type 1 activity to appear should be larger than the timescale for an unbound companion to escape from the close environment , or comparable to the timescale needed for an evolved merger ( @xmath62 years , see krongold et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the evolutionary scenario does not contradict the unification scheme .",
    "it implies that sy1s and sy2s are the same objects ( as the unification model proposes ) but not necessarily at the same evolutionary phase .",
    "however , there could be a phase where only orientation could define if an object appears as a sy1 or as a sy2 , which is the stage where molecular clouds form a torus but have not been swept away yet .",
    "evidently , more detailed observations of large samples of galaxies are needed to resolve this important issue .",
    "however , such a picture is consistent with the evolutionary scenario suggested by tran ( 2003 ) .",
    "he studied a sample of sy2 in polarized light , and found that only 50% of them showed the presence of a hidden broad line region ( hblr ) .",
    "he suggested that non - hblr sy2 galaxies could evolve into hblr sy2 galaxies . in this case , the appearance of the blr could be related to the accretion rate ( e.g. nicastro 2000 ) , and thus with the evolutionary stage of the object .",
    "the trend is also consistent with the finding that 50% of sy2 galaxies also show the presence of a strong starburst ( gu et al .",
    "2001 ; cid - fernandez et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "on the brightest end , there is also growing evidence showing ( a ) that ulirgs can be the precursors of quasars and ( b ) ulirgs are found in very strong interacting systems or in mergers ( e.g. sanders , surace and ishida 1999 ; wang et al .",
    "therefore , the evolutionary sequence proposed above could be general to all nuclear activity and independent on luminosity ( we note that krongold et al .",
    "2003 suggested a similar scheme for liners that can be considered as the very low luminosity extension of the evolutionary model suggested here ) .",
    "further evidence comes from the fact that type 2 quasars also tend to be in interaction more often than type 1 quasars ( serber et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in order to better understand the role of interactions in driving starburst and nuclear activity ( and the validity of the evolutionary trend ) , we are in the process of studying agn and starburst manifestations in the nearest neighbors of the active galaxies in our samples , since the same physical processes should act on both members of the pair ( host and nearest neighbor ) .",

    "<S> we present a 3-dimensional study of the local ( @xmath0 kpc ) and the large scale ( @xmath1 1 @xmath2 mpc ) environment of bright iras galaxies ( birgs ) . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we use 87 birgs located at high galactic latitudes ( with 0.008@xmath30.018 ) as well as a control sample of non - active galaxies having the same morphological , redshift and diameter size distributions as the corresponding birg sample . using the center for astrophysics ( cfa2 ) and southern sky redshift survey ( ssrs ) galaxy catalogues ( @xmath4 ) as well as our own spectroscopic observations ( @xmath5 ) for a subsample of the original birg sample , we find that the fraction of birgs with a close neighbor is significantly higher than that of their control sample . comparing with a related analysis of sy1 and sy2 galaxies of koulouridis et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2006 ) we find that birgs have a similar environment as sy2s , although the fraction of birgs with a bright close neighbor is even higher than that of sy2 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> an additional analysis of the relation between fir colors and the type of activity of each birg shows a significant difference between the colors of strongly - interacting and non - interacting starbursts and a resemblance between the colors of non - interacting starbursts and sy2s . </S>",
    "<S> our results support the view where close interactions can drive molecular clouds towards the galactic center , triggering starburst activity and obscuring the nuclear activity . </S>",
    "<S> when the close neighbor moves away , starburst activity is reduced with the simultaneous appearance of an obscured ( type 2 ) agn . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the complete disentanglement of the pair gives birth to an unobscured ( type 1 ) agn . </S>"
