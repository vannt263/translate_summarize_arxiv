    "while there are many possible jumping sequences , we will be interested in sequences which minimize the cost of going to @xmath5 with respect to a weighting function . given a weight function which assigns for @xmath21 a weight @xmath8 , then for any jumping pattern @xmath22 the weight associated with that pattern is the sum @xmath23    given a weight function we construct the weight minimizing jumping sequence with respect to the weight by the following procedure : let @xmath1 and @xmath24 . for @xmath3 let @xmath25 from the construction",
    "it is clear that the resulting sequence @xmath0 has the property that @xmath26 gives the minimum possible weight of all jumping patterns between @xmath7 and @xmath5 .",
    "it is possible that there are several @xmath27 s which achieve the minimum , by taking the lowest we avoid ambiguity and so more accurately the sequence @xmath0 finds the lexicographically first jumping sequence which minimizes the weight of all jumping patterns starting at @xmath7 and decreasing to @xmath5 . [",
    "an example of the ambiguity is for the weight function @xmath28 where every decreasing sequence between @xmath7 and @xmath5 has the same weight . ]",
    "different weight functions lead to different sequences . as an example",
    "let us consider the weight function @xmath29 ( the associated minimizing jump sequence of this function has applications to constructing optimal key trees for networks ; see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath30    let us remove repetitions and form a new set @xmath31 which is the set of all numbers which appear in @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath32 is a non - decreasing sequence ( as we will show in section  [ sec : basic ] ) we can easily form this by looking for the next occurrence of a previously unused number . doing this",
    "we get the following set : @xmath33 more generally , we can think of @xmath31 as all the possible numbers which are @xmath34 for some @xmath12 ( or in other words appear at depth @xmath5 in some jump pattern ) .",

    "if we apply this to our jumping sequence @xmath32 we get the following first few sets : @xmath38    there are a few obvious things to note , first is that @xmath39 , this easily follows from the definition . the other thing",
    "to notice is that the sequence appears to be collapsing to a specific set which we denote @xmath40 the set @xmath41 is the set of numbers which appear arbitrarily deep in jump patterns .",
    "pictorially , we can see the sieving process of these sets in figure  [ fig : sieve ] where we have marked the numbers which appear in @xmath42 between @xmath5 and @xmath43 and highlighted the members of @xmath41 red .     and @xmath44 .",

    "we will briefly look at finding optimal real jump sequences .",

    "to sieve the sequence it is important to know that it is increasing ; so that we only need look for the next new term .",
    "we will show for weight functions of a very general nature ( including all weight functions that we will consider in this paper ) that this is the case .",

    "the jump sequence @xmath32 is closely related to the cost sequence @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the minimal cost of all possible jump patterns between @xmath7 and @xmath5 .",

    "we need to introduce some constants which will play a role in the analysis .",

    "( as a result of theorem  [ thm : pell ] it will follow that @xmath77 as @xmath78 . )",
