    "in the last century , there has been a growing interest for computing fractal dimensions of various sets .",
    "the notion of fractal dimension goes back to h.  minkowski ( minkowski dimension ) , h. hausdorff ( hausdorff dimension ) and g. bouligand ( bouligand dimension ) . in dynamical systems ,",
    "fractal dimensions of invariant sets were used to measure the complexity of systems . for a short overview of applications of fractal dimensions in dynamics",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we deal here with box dimensions and minkowski contents of sets . among other applications",
    ", it has been noted that the box dimension and the minkowski content of spiral trajectories or of trajectories of poincar ' e maps around limit periodic sets show their cyclicity in perturbations , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also , box dimension and minkowski content of a set are closely related to the domain of analyticity of the associated distance zeta function , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a notion closely related to minkowski content is minkowski measurability .",
    "we cite some articles dealing with minkowski measurability , for example @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in their study of the weyl - berry conjecture , lapidus and",
    "pomerance in @xcite characterized compact sets on the real line which are minkowski measurable .",
    "they provided a method for constructing minkowski measurable sets on the real line of any box dimension @xmath0 .",
    "they further showed that the cantor set is not minkowski measurable on the real line .",
    "bilipschitz transformations preserve the box dimension of a set , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , not a lot about preserving minkowski measurability is known .",
    "bilipschitz mappings in general do not preserve minkowski measurability of sets , see @xcite .",
    "sufficiently general conditions imposed on mappings which ensure that minkowski measurability is preserved have not yet been proposed .    in this article",
    ", we pose the following questions : our results are stated in theorem  [ main ] and theorem  [ nmc ] in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "let us introduce the main notions .",
    "let @xmath1 be a bounded set .",
    "for @xmath2 , by @xmath3 we denote its @xmath4-neighborhood in @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the euclidean metric in @xmath5 .    for the following definitions , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the lebesgue measure of @xmath3 in @xmath5 .",

    "@xmath13 , using @xmath14 instead of @xmath15 .",
    "if the upper and the lower minkowski contents agree , then the @xmath9-_dimensional minkowski content of u _ , denoted by @xmath16 , is defined to be this common value .",
    "furthermore , _ the lower and upper box dimension _ of the set @xmath10 are defined respectively as @xmath17 they can be described as the moments of jump of the minkowski contents @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , as @xmath9 grows in @xmath22 $ ] . in the literature ,",
    "the upper box dimension is sometimes called the _",
    "limit capacity _ , see @xcite .",
    "if @xmath23 , we define _ the box dimension of the set @xmath10 _ as the common value : @xmath24    let us suppose now that the set @xmath25 has box dimension @xmath26 .",
    "if the upper and the lower @xmath27-dimensional minkowski contents of @xmath10 are both in @xmath28 , we say that the set @xmath29 is _ minkowski nondegenerate _ in @xmath5 . if moreover both minkowski contents agree , that is , if @xmath30 , we say that the set @xmath29 is _ minkowski measurable _ in @xmath5 . for simplicity , in this case , the @xmath27-dimensional minkowski content is called the minkowski content and denoted simply by @xmath31 .",
    "we state the result about the invariance of box dimension with respect to the ambient space in which we consider the set .",
    "that is , the box dimension of a set is an intrinsic property of the set .",
    "we were not able to find this result explicitely stated in the literature .",
    "[ invdim ] let @xmath32 be a bounded set .",

    "by @xcite , section 3.2 , the upper and the lower box dimensions are preserved under bilipschitz mappings .    by proposition [ invdim ] , we can denote the lower and the upper box dimensions of the set @xmath10 by @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , without mentioning the ambient space where we consider the set .",
    "our goal is to obtain a similar result for the minkowski content of a set @xmath29 .",
    "we can not proceed as in the above proof , since the minkowski content is not invariant under the bilipschitz mappings .",

    ", the minkowski contents are defined in the same way as in section  [ sec1 ] , that is , without any normalizing constant .",
    "let us recall an alternative definition of minkowski contents from e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
