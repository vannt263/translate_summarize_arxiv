    "in 1994 , shor s ground - breaking paper presented an efficient quantum algorithm for integer factoring @xcite .",
    "many other very important results have followed , but the true potential of quantum computers is still unknown .",
    "one step towards understanding it is to consider what are the differences between quantum and classical computers in a setting where we are given the input via a black - box oracle . because we can not know the inner workings of the oracle , it is easier to prove lower bounds in this model and",
    "therefore in many cases it is easier to show a separation between the best quantum and classical algorithms .",
    "ever since deutsch presented a simple oracle problem that can be solved on a quantum computer using fewer oracle queries than on any classical computer @xcite , scientists have tried to come up with more and more problems for which quantum computers outperform their classical counterparts ; some very artificial , some quite natural .",
    "bernstein and vazirani gave the first example of an oracle problem which can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum computer , but requires superpolynomial time on a classical computer @xcite .",
    "shortly after that simon gave an example in which this separation is exponential @xcite .",
    "yet it is unclear what are the best methods for the construction of efficient quantum algorithms .",
    "while quantum fourier sampling is probably the most popular such method so far , many algorithms are also based on the concept of quantum walk . in particular , continuous - time quantum walks on graphs , introduced by farhi and gutmann @xcite , give rise to fast algorithms for nand tree evaluation @xcite and unstructured search @xcite .",
    "continuous - time quantum walks are also known to be able to perform universal quantum computation @xcite , and they can solve some oracle problems exponentially faster than any classical algorithm @xcite .    in this paper we introduce a new type of continuous - time quantum walk on graphs , the basis states of which are not vertices of the graph , but paths in it of a fixed length @xmath0 .",
    "we define this new walk on an unweighted undirected graph @xmath1 as a regular continuous - time quantum walk ( the one introduced by farhi and gutmann ) on a more complex weighted undirected graph @xmath2 which is constructed from the original graph @xmath1 .",
    "since , to the author of this paper , the discrete - time classical counterpart of this walk in some sense resembles the behavior of a ` snake ' of length @xmath0 which is placed on a graph along its edges and which makes random decisions in which direction to go next , we call this new walk the _ continuous - time quantum snake walk_.    the main motivation for the continuous - time quantum snake walk is an extended version of the glued trees problem for which no efficient quantum algorithm yet is known .",

    "a glued trees graph via a black - box oracle and the label of the root of one tree , the glued trees problem is to determine the label of the root of the other tree .",
    "while there is an efficient quantum algorithm based on the continuous - time quantum walk which solves this problem , no efficient quantum algorithm which finds a path connecting these two roots is known .",
    "we hope that the continuous - time quantum snake walk might lead to a quantum algorithm efficiently finding such a path .    in section [ sec : line ]",
    "we analyze in detail the continuous - time quantum snake walk on the line .",
    "even though most states stay localized throughout the quantum evolution , there are specific states which , under one reasonable assumption , move on the line as wave packets with momentum inversely proportional to the length of the snake .",
    "this motion is similar to the regular continuous - time quantum walk on the line . in section [ sec",
    ": gtg ] we discuss an algorithm based on the continuous - time quantum snake walk that solves the extended version of the glued trees problem mentioned above , that is , finds a path connecting the roots of the glued trees graph .",

    "independently from this work , a recent paper by mcgettrick defines a discrete - time walk on the line similar to the continuous - time quantum snake walk on the line considered here @xcite .",
    "in this section we define the main concept of this paper , the continuous - time quantum snake walk .",
    "the main reason for considering this new type of quantum walk is its potential algorithmic applications . because of that we also define an extended version of the glued trees problem for which no efficient classical algorithm exists and no efficient quantum algorithm is known , but which might be solved efficiently using an algorithm based on the continuous - time quantum snake walk .",
    "we will define the continuous - time quantum snake walk on one graph as the continuous - time quantum walk on another specific graph .",

    "childs et al .",
    "introduced the glued trees graph @xcite .",
    "the _ glued trees graph _ consists of two complete binary trees of height @xmath52 , which are connected by a random cycle that alternates between the leaves of the two trees .",
    "an example of the graph is shown in figure [ fig : gluedtrees ] ( for @xmath53 ) .",

    "show that , if we start a continuous - time quantum walk at the root @xmath54 , the walk quickly ( in @xmath56 time ) traverses the graph and ends up in a superposition state which has a large overlap on the root @xmath55 .",
    "we can implement continuous - time quantum walks on sparse graphs in the quantum circuit model efficiently ( see @xcite ) , therefore there is an efficient quantum query algorithm solving the glued trees problem .",
    "it is also shown in @xcite that no classical query algorithm can solve this problem efficiently .",
    "given a glued trees graph via a black - box oracle and the label of one of its two roots @xmath54 , the _ extended glued trees problem _ is to find a path in the graph connecting @xmath54 to the opposite root @xmath55 .",

    "* section 5.4 ) .",
    "however , the hope is that the quantum snake walk might lead to an efficient algorithm .",
    "as an example of a continuous - time quantum snake walk , let us consider the quantum snake walk on the line , that is , the graph @xmath17 , where @xmath57 is the set of vertices and @xmath58 is the set of edges .",
    "this example is relatively simple compared to quantum snake walks on other graphs . nonetheless , understanding this walk",
    "later helps us to analyze snake walks on more complex graphs .",
    "it is convenient to think of the line also as the @xmath59-axis . for every snake @xmath60 on @xmath1 of length @xmath0 let @xmath61 be the start vertex of the snake and for @xmath23 $ ] let @xmath62 be such that @xmath63",
    "this gives a one - to - one relation between the set of snakes @xmath20 and the set @xmath64 .",
    "from now on let us consider any snake @xmath27 to be given as a pair @xmath65 , and let @xmath66 denote @xmath67 .",
    "every snake on the line can move forward to two other snakes and move backward to two other snakes . if a snake @xmath68 moves forward , then the start vertex of the new snake is determined by @xmath69 .",
    "its end vertex can either move in the positive or the negative direction of the @xmath59-axis . if a snake moves backward , the direction in which its start vertex moves is opposite to the direction of the first edge of the new snake .",
    "in other words , for every @xmath70 we have @xmath71 this allows us to obtain the hamiltonian @xmath72 governing the quantum snake walk on the line .",
    "after some derivations we get @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.1 ) for details ) . for every @xmath76 we have @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the dirac delta function ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , for any value @xmath79 , if @xmath80 is an eigenvector of @xmath81 with the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath82 , then @xmath83 is an eigenvector of @xmath84 corresponding to the same eigenvalue @xmath82 .",
    "let us focus on finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath81 for an arbitrary @xmath79 .",
    "this task becomes much easier if we express @xmath81 in a different basis .",

    "in this paper we introduced the continuous - time quantum snake walk and discussed one of its potential algorithmic applications , the extended glued trees problem . assuming the algorithm sketched in section [ ssec : algidea ] which uses wave packets as initial states indeed efficiently finds a path connecting both roots of the glued trees graph , it almost certainly will not find a shortest path .",
    "it would be interesting to see if there exists an efficient algorithm finding a shortest path , or an efficient quantum algorithm for any other pathfinding problem , which is based on the quantum snake walk .",
    "on the other hand , if the algorithm we propose is not efficient , despite that the wave packets ( most likely ) are being transmitted through the glued part with high probability and in polynomial time , it would suggest that possibly there are some fundamental limitations which restrict us from solving the extended glued trees problem efficiently .",
    "finding and understanding such limitations would be an interesting and useful thing to do .",

    "now , let us numerically calculate the coefficients @xmath503 and see what we obtain if we `` measure '' @xmath364 in the standard basis ( note that @xmath364 has an infinite euclidean norm ) . to be precise , we will be interested in the `` probabilities '' @xmath511 defined as follows",
