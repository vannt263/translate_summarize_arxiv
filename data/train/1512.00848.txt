    "@xcite presented a quantum simulation of a one - dimensional disordered ising model using a linear array of @xmath0 trapped - ion qubits , and they reported the experimental observation of many - body localization ( mbl )  @xcite .",
    "this disorder - induced phenomenon refers to the absence of thermalization in highly excited states of a strongly correlated , isolated quantum system , where the nonergodic time evolution fails to erase the local properties of the initial state . due to its marked departure from the usual hypotheses of quantum statistical mechanics , the strange properties of mbl  @xcite are an intense focus of current research , as surveyed by the recent reviews  @xcite .",
    "the study of mbl has up to now largely been driven forward by numerical calculations in finite - size systems of a few tens of spins or particles  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , they still fall short of directly addressing a fundamental issue of mbl physics , namely , whether a high - temperature thermalization - localization transition actually exists at _ finite _ disorder strength in an infinite system .",
    "this makes the recent experimental advances  @xcite particularly tantalizing , as they may soon be scaled up to simulate large quantum systems well beyond the capabilities of digital simulations on classical computers .    in this paper",
    "we provide a theoretical characterization of the coupled qubit dynamics in the trapped - ion experiment  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the heisenberg model commonly studied in the mbl literature  @xcite , the spins in the ion - trap quantum simulator are more appropriately modeled by a long - range ising hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "this prompts us to examine the trapped - ion system carefully and verify the experimental observation with numerical calculations .",
    "here we refrain from the attempt to tackle the ( putative ) localization transition in the thermodynamic limit . instead , we focus on the qualitative differences in coherent dynamics between strong and weak disorder at small system sizes relevant to current experiments .",

    "figure  [ fig : hamming - rp - dynamics](a ) shows that at weak disorder , @xmath20 quickly rises to @xmath29 , indicating a total loss of memory about the initial nel state , and as disorder increases , the asymptotic value of @xmath20 decreases steadily , signaling a gradual onset of localization . comparing our numerical results and the experimental data in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , we note that many features in the experimentally measured curves for @xmath20 are reproduced semi - quantitatively in our numerical results .",

    "nevertheless , even at the strongest disorder @xmath30 tested in ref .",
    "@xcite , the return probability is still far from unity .",

    "the chain of trapped ions is not a perfectly isolated system , and the decoherence due to the inevitable coupling to the environment limits the maximum duration of the dynamical measurement to a relatively short time period @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our digital simulation can be continued indefinitely , allowing us to check whether the state preservation is genuine or an artifact from limited measurement duration . as shown in fig .",

    "limited by the cost of numerical diagonalization , we are not able to directly probe the many - body localization phase transition , which is a sharp transition only in the thermodynamic limit @xmath38 .",
    "instead , we seek to investigate the finite - size crossover between the thermal phase and the localized phase for small systems .",
    "we quantify localization , or more precisely the lack of ergodicity , using the three measures of collective state preservation studied earlier .",
    "more specifically , we use the nel initial state and compute the magnetization at site @xmath33 , the hamming distance , and the return probability , and we use as localization indicators their asymptotic , steady - state values after a long time evolution for @xmath39 . in addition , we compute for each eigenstate the entanglement entropy associated with partitioning at the middle bond of the ion chain , and we use the entanglement entropy density averaged over all eigenstates as the fourth measure of localization .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : transition](a)-(c ) , we find that the three measures of collective state preservation all have a sigmoid - shaped dependence on disorder strength @xmath17 .",
    "we can ( arbitrarily ) define for each measure an effective critical disorder @xmath36 at finite size , by thresholding at the halfway point of the sigmoid ( indicated by the dotted line ) .",
    "for each of the three measures , we consistently find @xmath36 in the vicinity of @xmath40 , although it exhibits an upward drift as system size @xmath1 increases .",
    "this drift is most visible for the return probability , which may be partially attributed to overlap dilution from the exponential growth of the hilbert space .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition](d ) , we find that for the trapped ions with long - range coupling exponent @xmath13 , the middle - cut entanglement entropy on average exhibits an approximate volume law for @xmath41 , and at weaker disorder , the entanglement grows even faster as a function of system size @xmath1  .",
    "this behavior differs from the usual transition from volume law to area law as disorder increases in systems with short - range interactions .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative change in finite - size entanglement entropy scaling also occurs in the vicinity of @xmath42 , in accordance with the change in other localization measures quantifying state preservation .",
    "dependence of the effective critical disorder @xmath36 on the long - range ising exponent @xmath4 , estimated by thresholding ( a),(b ) the steady - state magnetization at site @xmath33 , and ( c),(d ) the steady - state normalized hamming distance .",

    "so far we have focused on the @xmath13 point in the long - range regime of the disordered ising model in order to stay close to the experimental results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following",
    "we move beyond the experimental setup and explore the effect of tuning @xmath4 on the localization transition .",
    "again , we characterize ergodicity breaking and localization using state preservation indicators and entanglement entropy .    figure  [ fig : critical - alpha ] shows the dependence of the effective critical disorder @xmath36 on the exponent @xmath4 and the system size @xmath1 , determined by thresholding the state preservation indicators ( as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition ] ) .",
    "here we have skipped the return probability , given its particularly strong size dependence noted previously . at large @xmath4 , the system has a clear localization transition , with the effective critical disorder @xmath36 exhibiting only a weak size dependence .",
    "as @xmath4 decreases , the localizing behavior is quickly and strongly suppressed . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the system resists localization until very strong disorder , and the critical @xmath36 exhibits a clear size dependence , with no sign of convergence as @xmath1 increases . limited by the small system sizes , our results are not sufficient to confidently conclude whether the system still localizes in this parameter regime , but we do see a strong tendency towards delocalization , in contrast to the claim in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this absence of localization for @xmath43 appears to obey anderson s criterion  @xcite for single - particle localization with long - range hopping @xmath44 in one dimension , and it is also consistent with more refined analyses based on resonant pairs  @xcite , although much larger size numerics are needed to settle the regime with @xmath4 slightly larger than one .",
    "it should also be noted that the effective strength of the long - range interaction relative to the on - site disorder is enhanced as system size increases , which may partially contribute to the growth of critical disorder as system size increases ( appendix [ sec : kac ] ) .",
    "disorder dependence of entanglement entropy ( ee ) density for different values of the long - range ising exponent @xmath4 .",

    ", the ising coupling is dominated by the nearest - neighbor part .",
    "accordingly , for @xmath45 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy - alpha](d ) , the eigenstates have on average an area - law entanglement entropy at strong disorder , and an approximate volume - law entanglement at weak disorder .",
    "this is the expected behavior for mbl systems with short - range interactions .",
    "as the ising coupling range expands with decreasing @xmath4 , the scaling of entanglement entropy grows steadily . for the intermediate value @xmath46 , the entanglement in the strong disorder phase exhibits a volume - law decay to zero as disorder increases . at",
    "very small @xmath4 , the long - range ising model completely loses its one - dimensional character and the entanglement entropy exhibits volume - law scaling for all disorder .",
    "such dichotomy between small and large @xmath4 is also visible in the dynamical growth of entanglement entropy ( appendix [ sec : entanglement - growth ] ) .",
    "to conclude , we numerically examine the coherent dynamics of coupled qubits in the trapped - ion experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the disordered ising system with long - range couplings",
    ", we study in detail the experimental parameter setup and characterize the localizing behavior through collective state preservation and quantum entanglement .",
    "we observe semiquantitative agreement between the experimental data and our numerical results .",
    "we note that the strongest disorder probed in the experiment appears to be in the middle of the finite - size localization crossover .",
    "in addition , we have also explored the effect of tuning the long - range exponent @xmath4 . for large @xmath4 ,",
    "the system exhibits a clear transition from a thermal phase at low disorder to a localized phase at strong disorder . for @xmath43 ,",

    "we address this point more carefully .",
    "we consider a _",
    "different _ model hamiltonian for the trapped ions , using an alternative normalization scheme , @xmath49 here , the normalization @xmath50 is given by the kac prescription  @xcite , @xmath51 this extra factor significantly enhances the effective strength of disorder relative to the ising coupling as the system size increases .",

    "we now examine the impact of the alternative normalization scheme on the scaling analysis .",

    "[ fig : critical - alpha - kac ] the resulting dependence of the effective critical disorder @xmath36 on the long - range exponent @xmath4 and the system size @xmath1 .",
    "we find that @xmath36 grows only moderately as @xmath1 increases , and it also does not exhibit a strong @xmath4 dependence .",
    "the model hamiltonian @xmath47 thus appears to have a localization transition at finite disorder strength even for very small value of @xmath4 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the unbounded growth of the critical @xmath36 with increasing system size at small @xmath4 in the absence of the kac rescaling , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : critical - alpha ] of the main text .",
    "we emphasize that this qualitative change in ergodic or localizing behaviors stems from the different normalization schemes used in @xmath10 and @xmath47 .",
    "conventional wisdom recommends the kac prescription as it renormalizes the long - range coupling to have an extensive total energy .",

    "a hallmark of the _ many - body _ ( as opposed to single - particle ) localized phase of a local hamiltonian is the logarithmic spreading of entanglement entropy  @xcite . in the following ,",

    "we use the nel initial state @xmath35 , and we compute entanglement entropy using the middle - cut partition detailed in the main text .",
    "we start our analysis with the relatively simple , short - range coupled case at @xmath45 , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : entanglement - growth](a ) and ( b ) . for weak disorder ,",
    "we observe a linear growth of entanglement that quickly saturates to a value proportional to the system size @xmath1 , consistent with a thermal phase .",
    "in contrast , for strong disorder such ballistic spreading of entanglement is superseded by a slow , logarithmic growth in the time window @xmath53 , which is characteristic of many - body localization in short - range coupled systems .",
    "this further corroborates our claim that the disordered ising hamiltonian in the short - range interaction regime display a many - body localization transition .",
    "the situation for the experimental system with long - range coupling ( @xmath13 ) is less transparent . comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : entanglement - growth](c ) and ( d ) , we do not observe a qualitative distinction between strong and weak disorder .",
    "this apparent resistance against many - body localization for small @xmath4 is consistent with our results obtained in the main text from analyzing the state preservation indicators and the eigenstate entanglement entropy .",
    "quantitatively , we find that strong disorder still impedes the spreading of entanglement , but limited by the small system sizes , we are not able to identify the scaling behavior ( linear , logarithmic , or power law  @xcite ) of the entanglement growth as a function of time . it should be noted that such subtlety is a direct consequence of the long - range coupling between the trapped ions , and the experimental measurements of entanglement entropy will reflect exactly the same difficulties .",
