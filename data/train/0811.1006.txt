    "fluctuations of conserved charges , like baryon number , electric charge and strangeness , are generally considered to be sensitive indicators for the structure of ( subsets of ) a thermal medium produced in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "in fact , if at non - vanishing baryon number a critical point exists in the qcd phase diagram , this will be signaled by divergent fluctuations of e.g. the baryon number density @xcite .    under conditions met in current experiments at rhic as well as in the upcoming heavy ion experiments at the lhc",
    "the net baryon number is small and qcd at vanishing chemical potential provides a good approximation . in this region",
    "the transition from the low temperature hadronic to the high temperature plasma regime is continuous and fluctuations are not expected to lead to any singular behavior .",
    "nonetheless , they provide direct insight into the structure of the thermal medium , the relevant degrees of freedom and their correlations .",
    "furthermore , enhanced fluctuations provide hints for nearby singularities in the qcd phase diagram related to the chiral limit at vanishing net baryon number as well as for a possible critical point at physical values of the quark masses at non - vanishing net baryon number density @xcite .    away from criticality , _",
    "i.e. _ under conditions met at rhic and lhc , indications for the existence of such critical points can only show up in higher order derivatives of the qcd partition function with respect to temperature or chemical potentials . through the analysis of fluctuations of conserved charges as well as their higher moments and correlations we thus gain insight into the relevant degrees of freedom of the system under consideration and at the same time",
    "gather information on possible nearby singularities in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "from lattice calculations at vanishing chemical potential it is well known that baryon number and strangeness susceptibilities are sensitive indicators for the transition from the low temperature hadronic regime to the high temperature quark gluon plasma .",
    "also in the case of a continuous crossover transition , as is the case for qcd with physical quark masses , the susceptibilities rise rapidly in the transition region @xcite .",
    "this shows that on the scale of the temperature the ( quasi)-particles carrying the quantum numbers under consideration ( @xmath0 ) are heavy at low and light at high temperature .    in calculations with two light , dynamical quark degrees of freedom ( 2-flavor qcd ) it also has been shown that baryon number and electric charge fluctuations increase and that their fourth moments start to show pronounced peaks in the transition region from low to high temperature @xcite .",
    "in fact , higher order cumulants of e.g. baryon number fluctuations , become increasingly sensitive to the singular behavior in the vicinity of the chiral phase transition at zero mass and vanishing chemical potential . starting from the @xmath1th order cumulant baryon number fluctuations",
    "will diverge in the chiral limit and are expected to reflect critical behavior in accordance with the @xmath2 symmetric universality of the chiral transition .",
    "it also has been noted that the analysis of correlations between different quantum numbers or flavor channels will provide insight into the quasi - particle structure and the relevant degrees of freedom in qcd at high temperature @xcite . in lattice calculations",
    "this has been analyzed in quenched @xcite and 2-flavor qcd @xcite .",
    "recent lattice calculations for the qcd equation of state performed with dynamical light and strange quark degrees of freedom @xcite now also allow to perform a systematic analysis of these correlations among different quantum number channels including effects arising from the treatment of strange quarks as dynamical degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "we present here results from lattice calculations of baryon number , electric charge and strangeness fluctuations in qcd with dynamical light and strange quark degrees of freedom .",
    "the results are based on calculations with an improved staggered fermion action ( p4-action ) that strongly reduces lattice cut - off effects in bulk thermodynamics at high temperature .",
    "the values of the quark masses used in this calculation are almost physical ; the strange quark mass , @xmath3 , is fixed to its physical value while the light up and down quark masses are taken to be degenerate and equal to @xmath4 .",
    "this is about twice as large as the average up and down quark masses realized in nature .",
    "we obtained results from calculations performed with two different values of the lattice cut - off , corresponding to lattices with temporal extent @xmath5 and @xmath1 .",
    "this allows us to judge the magnitude of systematic effects arising from discretization errors in our improved action calculations .",
    "the spatial volume has been chosen to be @xmath6 , which insures that finite volume effects are small .",
    "at vanishing baryon number ( @xmath7 ) , electric charge ( @xmath8 ) and strangeness ( @xmath9 ) fluctuations of these quantities can be obtained by starting from the qcd partition function with non - zero light and strange quark chemical potentials , @xmath10 .",
    "the quark chemical potentials can be expressed in terms of chemical potentials for baryon number ( @xmath11 ) , strangeness ( @xmath12 ) and electric charge ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14    moments of charge fluctuations , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 and their correlations are then obtained from derivatives of the logarithm of the qcd partition function , _",
    "i.e. _ the pressure , @xmath17 evaluated at @xmath18 , @xmath19 with @xmath20 . while the first derivatives , _ i.e. _ baryon number , electric charge and strangeness densities , vanish for @xmath21 , their moments and correlation functions with @xmath22 even are non - zero .",
    "the basic quantities we will analyze here are the quadratic and quartic charge fluctuations . ] , @xmath23 and the correlations among two conserved charges , @xmath24    these quantities have been evaluated in the temperature interval @xmath25 on lattices of size @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . on the @xmath26 lattice we also calculated @xmath1th order expansion coefficients , @xmath28",
    "the gauge field configurations , that have been used to evaluate the above observables , had been generated previously in calculations of the qcd equation of state @xcite and the transition temperature @xcite .",
    "in these calculations the strange quark mass has been tuned close to its physical value and the light quark masses have been chosen to be one tenth of the strange quark mass .",
    "this corresponds to a line of constant physics on which the kaon mass is close to its physical value and the lightest pseudo - scalar mass . as a consequence only one of the pseudo - scalar mesons has a light mass that is proportional to @xmath29 and vanishes in the chiral limit at fixed @xmath30 .",
    "full chiral symmetry with the correct goldstone pion multiplet is recovered only for @xmath31 . for a study of the remaining flavor symmetry violations with the p4-action in the quenched case see  @xcite . for dynamical calculations discussed here",
    "we have calculated one of the non - goldstone pion masses at cut - off values corresponding to the transition region of our @xmath5 and @xmath1 calculations .",
    "this gives @xmath32  mev and @xmath33  mev , respectively .",
    "] is about 220  mev , _",
    "i.e. _ the light quark masses used in these calculations are about a factor 2 larger than their physical values .",
    "further details on the improved gauge and staggered fermion actions used in these calculations are given in @xcite .",
    "the number of gauge field configurations analyzed varies from about 300 at high to 1500 at low temperatures .",
    "subsequent configurations are separated by 10 to 60 trajectories .",
    "the various operators contributing to @xmath34 have been calculated using unbiased random estimators @xcite . while at high temperature already 50 random sources per configuration were sufficient to get reliable estimates for these observables , we used up to 480 random sources below the transition temperature .",
    "autocorrelations of the operators contributing to the quadratic and quartic fluctuations turned out to be about 100 trajectories close to @xmath35 and to drop quickly away from it .",
    "errors on these fluctuations have been determined by means of the jack - knife procedure .",
    "some details on our data sample are given in table  [ tab : stat ] .",
    ".the data samples analyzed on lattices of temporal extent @xmath36 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the columns give from left to right the temperature values , the number of configurations used in this calculation , the number of trajectories by which these configurations are separated and the number of random vectors used for the evaluation of traces .",
    "[ cols=\"^,>,^,>,^,>,^ , > \" , ]     the analysis of cumulant ratios presented in the previous section suggests that for temperatures above @xmath37 fluctuations of baryon number , strangeness and electric charge agree well with the corresponding fluctuations in a non - interacting gas of light and strange quarks . in order to further test whether the relevant quasi - particle degrees of freedom indeed can be assigned to quarks , the analysis of correlations between different charges is quite instructive @xcite .",
    "results for correlations between @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : cor ] and [ fig : corqs ] . for completeness",
    "we also include the hrg - prediction .",
    "we note that the model is not expected and , in fact , does not capture the fluctuations and correlations in the transition region correctly .",
    "however , as shown in figs . 6 and 7 as well as in fig .",
    "4 it reproduces qualitatively the features of fluctuations and correlations .",
    "in particular , the drop and rise seen in our numerical results for @xmath41 and @xmath42 correlations , respectively , is seen also in the hrg model calculations . to put these observations on a more quantitative basis",
    "will require further calculations at lower temperatures .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cor ] the correlation functions in the numerator project only on the charged baryon sector of the spectrum .",
    "the ratio @xmath43 therefore approaches @xmath44 in the low temperature limit as the numerator receives contributions from protons and anti - protons only , while the denominator also receives contributions from the neutrons .",
    "the ratio @xmath45 , however , will approach zero in the low temperature limit as the lightest baryons carry no strangeness !    in fig .",
    "[ fig : corqs ] we show the correlation among @xmath8 and @xmath9 normalized to the quadratic fluctuations of electric charge .",
    "a similar ratio , where strangeness fluctuations have been used to normalize the @xmath8-@xmath9 correlations , has been discussed in @xcite and has also been calculated in 2-flavor qcd with a quenched strange quark sector @xcite .",
    "we prefer the above normalization , as it emphasizes the non trivial correlations between @xmath8 and @xmath9 that persist in the high temperature phase of qcd . unlike @xmath46 the charge fluctuations @xmath47 approach the ideal gas value rapidly above @xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fluc ] ) . the deviations from ideal gas behavior seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : corqs ] thus are mainly due to the deviations of @xmath48 from ideal gas behavior .",
    "this is shown in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : corqs ] .",
    "apparently , the temperature dependence of @xmath48 is very similar to that of @xmath46 .",
    "we have analyzed the fluctuations of baryon number , electric charge and strangeness in finite temperature qcd at vanishing chemical potential .",
    "a comparison of calculations performed with @xmath49 improved staggered fermions for two different values of the lattice cut - off shows that these effects are generally small ; cut - off effects as well as the dependence of observables on the light quark masses become , however , more severe for higher order cumulants .",
    "we find fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges are well described by an ideal , massless quark gas already for temperatures of about ( @xmath50 ) times the transition temperature .",
    "deviations from ideal gas behavior seem to be mainly induced by the strange quark sector for which the quadratic quark number fluctuations approach the ideal gas limit more slowly .",
    "this can not only be explained by the quark mass dependence of an ideal gas but seems to reflect a significant quark mass dependence of the interaction at high temperature .    at low temperature",
    "we find that fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges are reasonably well described by a hadron resonance gas up to temperatures close to the transition temperature .",
    "higher order cumulants , however , signal that the resonance gas prescription has to break down at temperature values close but below @xmath35 .    the current analysis has been performed with light quarks that are one tenth of the strange quark mass .",
    "we have shown , that higher order cumulant ratios like , for instance @xmath51 , become quite sensitive to the pseudo - scalar goldstone mass . in numerical calculations with staggered fermions",
    "this also means that results become sensitive to a correct representation of the entire goldstone multiplet .",
    "calculations with smaller quark masses closer to the continuum limit will thus be needed in the future to correctly resolve these higher order cumulants , which will give deeper insight into the range of applicability of the resonance gas model at low temperature and the non - perturbative features of the qgp above but close to @xmath35 .",

    "department of energy , the bundesministerium fr bildung und forschung under grant 06bi401 , the gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung under grant bilaer and the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft under grant grk 881 .",
    "numerical simulations have been performed on the qcdoc computer of the riken - bnl research center , the doe funded qcdoc at bnl , the apenext at bielefeld university and the bluegene / l at the new york center for computational sciences ( nyccs ) .",
    "cut - off effects arising from the introduction of a finite lattice spacing and , in particular , their dependence on the discretization scheme have been extensively discussed in the ideal gas limit .",
    "however , standard as well as @xmath49 improved staggered fermion formulations have usually been analyzed in the massless limit , which is appropriate for the light quark sector of qcd . for the strange quark sector non - zero",
    "mass effects may play a role , in particular close to the qcd transition temperature which is only about twice as large as the strange quark mass .",
    "we present here an analysis of the quark mass dependence of cut - off effects in the ideal gas limit .",
    "the quark number susceptibilities are obtained as the second derivative of the pressure , @xmath52 , with respect to the chemical potential normalized to the temperature , @xmath53 .",
    "an analysis of the cut - off and quark mass dependence of @xmath54 thus can follow closely the corresponding analysis performed for the pressure . ] in the massless limit @xcite . on a lattice of size @xmath55",
    "this is given by @xmath56 with , @xmath57 where @xmath58\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are obtained by cyclic permutation of the @xmath62s . for the standard ( naive ) discretization scheme , one has @xmath63 , @xmath64 ; the discretization scheme used in the p4-action corresponds to @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and for the naik action it is @xmath68 and @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we evaluate here quark number susceptibilities as a function of quark mass on lattices with finite temporal extent @xmath71 and infinite spatial volume for the standard ( naive ) staggered fermion discretization and the improved ( p4 ) discretization scheme . for vanishing quark mass results on the cut - off dependence of quark number susceptibilities in the ideal gas limit",
    "have also been presented in ref .",
    "there also some results for @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be found .    starting with the expressions for @xmath52 at non - zero chemical potential ( @xmath74 ) and taking two derivatives with respect to @xmath53 one finds in the standard scheme for @xmath75 , @xmath76 the corresponding expressions for the p4 and naik actions are somewhat more complicated but can be derived straightforwardly .",
    "as expected , the cut - off dependence of @xmath79 at non - zero values of the quark mass closely follow the pattern known from the analysis of the pressure at finite @xmath71 and @xmath82 .",
    "while the standard discretization scheme shows large deviations from the continuum result even for @xmath83 , the results for the p4 action come close to the continuum result already for @xmath84 .",
    "this also is true for the ratio @xmath85 .",
    "although in this ratio a large part of the cut - off dependence cancels , the quark mass dependent corrections remain .",
    "we note , that for finite @xmath71 the quark mass dependence of @xmath85 in the naive discretization scheme is weaker than in the continuum limit .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the differences seen in the lower part of fig .",
