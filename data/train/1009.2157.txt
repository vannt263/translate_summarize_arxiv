    "the problem of time @xcite occurs because ` time ' takes a different meaning in each of ordinary quantum theory ( qt ) and general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "this incompatibility creates serious problems with trying to replace these two branches of physics with a single framework in regimes in which neither qt nor gr can be neglected , as occurs in black holes or in the very early universe . resolving this incompatibility is of clear importance if theoretical physics is to form a coherent whole .",
    "study of the problem of time is also important toward acquiring more solid foundations for the gradually - developing discipline of quantum cosmology ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "i next consider a number of facets of the problem of time ( and various technical issues that become entwined with these ) .",
    "one notable facet of the problem of time shows up in attempting canonical quantization of gr ( or many other gravitational theories that are likewise background - independent ) .    *",
    "frozen formalism facet * the canonical approach at the classical level gives a constraint that is quadratic in the momenta but contains no linear dependence on the momenta .",
    "for gr , this is the hamiltonian constraint , be some fixed spatial topology , taken to be a compact without boundary one for simplicity .",
    "then @xmath1 is a spatial metric on @xmath2 , with determinant @xmath3 , conjugate momentum @xmath4 , covariant derivative @xmath5 and ricci scalar ric(x ; @xmath3 ] .",
    "the many possible @xmath1 on @xmath2 form the redundant configuration space riem(@xmath2 ) .",
    "@xmath7 is the gr configuration space metric ( n.b . that this is indefinite ) , with determinant @xmath8 , inverse @xmath9 ( the undensitized form of the dewitt supermetric ) and ricci scalar ric(@xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is proportional to the energy density of the universe model s matter , and @xmath12 is proportional to the momentum flux of the universe model s matter .",
    "@xmath13 is the cosmological constant and @xmath14 is the wavefunction of the universe .",

    "i use fundamental units . ] : = g_abcd^ab^cd/ - \\{(x;h ] - 2 } + h^ = 0 . then promoting an equation with a momentum dependence of this kind to the quantum level does not give a time - dependent wave equation such as ( for some notion of time @xmath16 and some quantum hamiltonian @xmath17 ) i / t = as one might expect , but rather a stationary , i.e. frozen , i.e. timeless equation = 0 .",
    "[ calh ] in the case of gr , this is the _ wheeler  dewitt equation _ ( wde ) ; in more detail , : = -  \\ { ^abcd } - ( h;g]- ( x;h]+ 2 + ^= 0 [ wde ] .",
    "this suggests , in apparent contradiction with everyday experience , that noting at all _ happens _ in the universe !",
    "thus one is faced with having to explain the origin of the notions of time in the laws of physics that appear to apply in the universe ; this paper reviews a number of strategies for such explanations .",
    "[ moreover timeless equations such as the wde apply _ to the universe as a whole _",
    ", whereas the more ordinary laws of physics apply to small subsystems _ within _ the universe , which does suggest that this is an apparent , rather than actual , paradox . ]",
    "that , whilst considering special relativity changes _ the form _ of the time - dependent wave equations involved , _ the passage from newtonian theory to special relativity merely swaps newton s notion of absolute time for another absolute notion  that associated with the timelike killing vector of minkowski spacetime_. in this sense , it is the passage to _ general _ relativity that is the one which brings about a problem of time ( see @xcite for more ) .",
    "this is closely tied to how gr has two aspects : it is not only a theory of gravitation , but also , following einstein , a way of freeing physics from absolute structures .",
    "this second aspect , moreover , is quite clearly not specific just to the field equations of gr ; a wider range of theories with different field equations also possess such a ` background - independent ' or ` diffeomorphism invariant ' aspect .",
    "one follow - on from the frozen formalism facet as manifested by a frozen equation like the wde of gr is the hilbert space / inner product problem , i.e. how one is to turn the space of solutions of that frozen equation into a hilbert space .",
    "\\1 ) the reader will have noticed unexplained inverted commas in formula ( [ wde ] ) .",
    "these indicate that the wheeler - dewitt equation has , in addition to the problem of time , various technical problems , including operator ordering issues , regularization problems , and whether functional differential equations are meaningful .",
    "\\2 ) the preceding ssec s page s ` plain quantum geometrodynamics ' scheme corresponds to considering the canonical    commutation relation @xmath18 =   i\\delta_i^a\\delta_j^b\\delta^3(x , x^{\\prime})$ ] .",
    "however , there is also an alternative ` affine quantum geometrodynamics ' scheme @xcite in which , so as to keep on imposing the classical spacelike metric condition det(@xmath3 ) @xmath19 0 at the quantum level , one considers , rather , the affine commutation relation @xmath20 = i h_{ij}\\delta_m\\mbox{}_j(x)\\delta^3(x , x^{\\prime } ) \\mbox { } .\\ ] ] [ strictly , the right hand sides in this paragraph are symmetrized over @xmath21 , @xmath22 . ]",
    "others may prefer to pass from geometrodynamical variables to ashtekar variables , or to consider the supesymmetric version of gr ( supergravity ) or some form of string theory .",
    "the problem of time persists throughout all these theories ( at a deep enough level ) , but how various strategies to deal with it fare differs from theory to theory .",
    "this is the subject of much of the conclusion .",
    "\\3 ) the canonical approach to gr also gives the _ momentum constraint _",
    ", _ i : = - 2d_j^j_i + h_i^ = 0 . unlike the quadratic constraint ,",
    "the momentum constraint is purely linear in the momenta .",
    "furthermore , the momentum constraint embodies invariance under spatial 3-diffeomorphisms diff(@xmath2 ) . taking this into account , one passes from riem(@xmath2 ) to the less redundant / more reduced configuration space superspace(@xmath2 ) = riem(@xmath2)/diff(@xmath2 ) of spatial 3-geometries .",
    "promoted to the quantum level , the momentum constraint takes the form _ i : = - 2h_ikd_j + _ i^= 0 .",
    "[ calhi ]    \\4 ) the canonical approach considers a sequence of spatial 3-surfaces that constitute a foliation of spacetime . moreover ,",
    "invariance under 4- ( rather than 3-)diffeomorphisms diff(@xmath23 ) of the spacetime @xmath24 is altogether harder to find / account for in canonical approaches to gr .",
    "in particular , the ` missing ' diffeomorphisms are not directly accountable for via the presence of the hamiltonian constraint . this is reflected e.g. in the dirac algebra of the hamiltonian and momentum constraints being distinct from , and much less mathematically tractable than , the algebra of spacetime 4-diffeomorphisms . in particular , this algebra involves not structure constants but more general structure functions that depend on the 3-metric variable .",
    "at least this algebra has the useful property of closing at the classical level without further constraints becoming necessary to do so . also , in classical gr , one can foliate spacetime in many ways , each corresponding to a different choice of timefunction .",
    "thus time in classical gr is ` many - fingered ' , with each finger  pointing orthogonally to each possible foliation . and ,",
    "furthermore , classical gr has the remarkable property of being foliation independent , so that going between two given spatial geometries by means of different foliations in between produces the same region of spacetime and so the same answers to whatever physical questions can be posed therein .    finally , note",
    "that the momentum constraint often becomes entwined in technical problems becoming problem of time strategies ; many such entwinings furthermore specifically involve diffeomorphisms ( see sec 1.5 ) .",
    "over the past decade , it has become more common to argue or imply that the problem of time _ is _ the frozen formalism problem .",
    "however , a more long - standing point of view @xcite that the problem of time contains a number of further facets ; i argue in favour of this in this paper .",
    "it should first be stated that the problems encountered in trying to quantize gravity largely interfere with each other rather than standing as independent obstacles .",
    "kucha talked of this in @xcite as a ` many gates ' problem , in which one attempting to enter the gates in sequence finds that they are no longer inside some of the gates they had previously entered .",
    "( the object being described is presumably some kind of enchanted castle , or , at least , a topologically nontrivial one ) .",
    "additionally , the various of these problems that are deemed to be facets of the problem of time do bear conceptual and technical relations that makes it likely to be advantageous to treat them as parts of a coherent package rather than disassembling them into a mere list of problems to be addressed piecemeal . for",
    ", these facets arise from a joint cause , i.e. the mismatch of the notions of time in gr and qt .    as such",
    ", i suggest the following further parable the problem of time .",
    "one notices that the physical equations get frozen .",
    "one reaction is to set about trying to unfreeze them .",
    "however , another perspective is that an ice dragon @xcite may be on the loose , a beast not that not only possesses the ` freezing breath ' of the frozen formalism but which is the joint cause of other observed devastations , through coming simultaneously equipped with 1 ) ` many - fingered claws ' on four ` limbs ' that are the somewhat interlinked i ) functional evolution problem , ii ) foliation dependence problem , iii ) multiple choice problem , and iv ) sandwich problem , 2 ) the ` thunderbolt tail ' of the global problem of time , 3 ) the ` scaled armour ' of the spacetime reconstruction problem , and 4 ) the ` wings ' of the problem of observables . nor do the attributes of the ice dragon take an entirely fixed form .",
    "e.g. in path - integral rather than canonical approaches , one has to reckon with a measure problem instead of some of the difficulties of interpreting a frozen wave equation .",
    "now , setting about unfreezing the physics is likely more straightforward than defeating an ice dragon .",
    "some might even claim to be defeating the ice dragon by just unfreezing the physics , by taking its rather feared ` problem of time ' name and rebranding this name to mean just its ` frozen formalism facet . '",
    "however , this amounts to leaving oneself open to the ` claws ' , ` tail ' , ` scales ' and ` wings ' by choosing not to take any advantage of the presence of a joint cause ",
    "the mismatch of the notion of time in gr and qt  as a warning that these , too , would also be expected to be present as obstacles needing overcoming before one s quantum gravity program has genuine long - term viability .",
    "( though it may take long for this to be demonstrated , through requiring detailed analysis of difficult and diverse quantum - gravitational calculations ) .",
    "i next outline the nature of these other facets of the problem of time .",
    "the * sandwich problem * is already present at the classical level and gets involved in some of the approaches that start with manipulations at the classical level prior to quantizing .",
    "it consists in the following .",
    "the generating function for the canonical transformation corresponding to the evolution of the gravitational field needs to be a function of the initial and final slices metrics in the classical configuration representation .",
    "however , this is not a unique procedure in the absense of a resolution of the thin sandwich conjecture @xcite .    for all that one would like a quantization of gr to retain the nice classical properties of refoliation invariance and closure of the constraint algebra , there is no longer an established way of guaranteeing these properties at the quantum level .",
    "thus there is a * foliation dependence problem*. there is also a * functional evolution problem * : the quantum - level problem that the commutator of constraints is capable . in the present case of the quantum counterpart of the dirac algebra of gr constraints",
    ", this is a time issue due to the meaning of these constraints . in particular ,",
    "non - closure here is a way in which the foliation dependence problem can manifest itself , through the non - closure becoming entwined with details of the foliation .",
    "[ non - closure is also entwined with the operator ordering problem , since changing the ordering gives additional right - hand - side pieces not present in the classical poisson brackets algebra . ]",
    "the * multiple choice problem * is the purely quantum - mechanical problem that different choices of time variable may give inequivalent quantum theories .",
    "it is a subcase of how making different choices of sets of variables to quantize may give inequivalent quantum theories , which follows from the groenewold ",
    "van hove theorem @xcite .",
    "foliation dependence is one of the ways in which the multiple choice problem can manifest itself .",
    "moreover , the multiple choice problem is known to occur even in some finite toy models .",
    "it has been suggested that one way out of the multiple choice problem is to specify the lapse @xmath25 and shift @xmath26 a priori ( e.g. in @xcite ) .",
    "however , such amounts to foliation fixing , which is not what done in practise , nor desirable in principle , since one would like to be able to ascribe physical meaning to whichever foliation ( and consider e.g. whether two distinct foliations between two given hypersurfaces match in their physical predictions at the quantum level ) .",
    "also , foliation issues are not the only possible source of the multiple choice problem .",
    "the * global problem of time * is already present at the classical level .",
    "it consists of the separation into true and embedding ( space frame and timefunction ) variables having a capacity for being globally impossible , for reasons in close parallel to the gribov ambiguity in yang  mills theory .",
    "the global problem of time moreover subdivides into a part by which such a split can not be defined on a given hypersurface , and a part by which such a split can be defined but can not be indefinitely continued as one progresses along a foliation .    the * spacetime ( replacement or reconstruction ) problem . * internal space or time coordinates to be used in the conventional classical spacetime context need to be scalar field functions on the 4-manifold @xmath24 . in particular , these do not have any foliation dependence . however , the canonical approach to gr uses functionals of the canonical variables , and which there is no a priori reason for such to be scalar fields of this type .",
    "thus one is faced with either finding functionals with this property , or coming up with a new means of reducing to the standard spacetime meaning at the classical level .",
    "there are further issues involving properties of spacetime being problematical at the quantum level .",
    "qt implies fluctuations are unavoidable , but now that this amounts to fluctuations of geometry , these are moreover too numerous to fit within a single spacetime ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus ( something like ) the superspace picture ( considering the set of possible 3-geometries ) might be expected to take over from the spacetime picture at the quantum level .",
    "it is then not clear what becomes of causality ( or of locality , if one believes that the quantum replacement for spacetime is ` foamy ' ) .",
    "the * problem of observables*. this involves construction of a sufficient set of observables for the physics of one s model , which are then involved in the model s notion of evolution .    one further issue that is usually considered to be not part of the problem of time mismatch but rather a further time problem is the * arrow of time*.",
    "this is a further issue since it concerns not ",
    "what happens to the notion of time upon jointly considering qt and gr \" but rather  why is there a ( theory - independent and in practise observed ) consistent distinction between past and future ? \" quantum gravity or quantum cosmology are then sometimes evoked in attempts to better explain this than one has managed to do with more everyday physical theories .      over the years",
    ", many conceptual strategies have been put forward to resolve the problem of time . however , none of those proposed to up to 1993 worked upon detailed examination @xcite , while not all work since has been investigated in such detail .",
    "some of the differences in problem of time strategies result from what are ( see e.g. @xcite ) two well - established and conflicting philosophical positions concerning time    \\a ) that time is fundamental , or    \\b ) that time should be eliminated from one s conceptualization of the world .    these two perspectives can be related in various ways to schemes for the world , and the scientific enterprise therein , in which question - types involving ` becoming ' fundamentally make sense , or only those involving ` being ' .    in kucha @xcite and isham @xcite , classification of the problem of time strategies , another element is whether the identification of what is the time is to be done before or after quantization ( if time is to be identified at all ) .",
    "thus strategies for the problem of time can be divided up as follows .",
    "* tempus ante quantum * schemes ( sec 2 ) follow a ) by , prior to quantization , having a fundamental time in their general case .",
    "such strategies include hidden time in pure geometrodynamics , a matter time arising from the adjunction of matter to geometrodynamics , and unimodular gravity ( in which a dynamical cosmological constant provides a time - standard ) .    * tempus post quantum * schemes ( sec 3 ) follow b ) insofar as there is no time in general at the classical level , but follow a ) insofar as one restricts attention to cases for which a suitable notion of time does then emerge at the quantum level . such strategies include superspace time and an associated klein  gordon - type inner product , third quantization and the emergent semiclassical time approach .    * tempus nihil est * schemes , follow b ) insofar as they deny a role for time and then see how far one can do physics without .",
    "such strategies included , by the early 90 s , the nave schrdinger interpretation , the conditional probabilities interpretation ( both among sec 4 s ` type 1 tempus nihil est approaches ' ) , histories theory ( sec 5 ) , and a rather distinct type 2 ` rovelli ' approach involving evolving constants of the motion ( sec 7 ) .",
    "i note moreover that histories theory supplants the notion of time by the notion of history .",
    "this has somewhat of a different status , insofar as i ) one passes from configuration space and the associated phase space being regarded as primary and being subjected to quantization to it being histories that are regarded as primary and subjected to quantization .",
    "ii ) histories theory is a spacetime - first approach , whilst all the other approaches that isham and kucha term ` tempus nihil est ' are space - first approaches . due to this distinction",
    ", i myself consider histories theory to lie outside of my own use of ` tempus nihil est ' , as a fourth division dubbed * non tempus sed historia*.    ( spacetime primality versus spatial primality is also an issue in tempus ante quantum and tempus post quantum strategies ; spacetime primality is linked to the wish to maintain , or recover , spacetime general covariance / spacetime diffeomorphism invariant formulations .",
    "some approaches also assume strong preference for the primality of one of spacetime or space .",
    "bias towards spacetime approaches may well come from the spacetime perspective is a very fruitful approach to classical gr and in quantum particle physics in a minkowskian background .",
    "however , it is far from clear if such successes will extend to the realm of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "this ` spacetime versus space ' point will be expanded on in various secs below . )",
    "the main developments since the early 90 s , which are covered mostly in the second half of this paper , are as follows .",
    "\\1 ) histories theory has diversified ( sec 5 ) .",
    "\\2 ) each side of tempus nihil est s split into type 1 and type 2 ` rovelli ' has further expanded and diversified . for type 1 , various forms of timeless records theory have appeared ( sec 4 ) , including barbour s , page s and mine , and also records theory within histories theory ( work of halliwell @xcite building on work of gell - mann and hartle @xcite , see secs 5 and 6 ) .",
    "\\3 ) for type 2 , most of the advances in it ( by rovelli , thiemann and dittrich , see sec 7 and 8) are tied to further developments in loop quantum gravity ( though many of the other types of problem of time strategy are also considered in this arena , see sec 8.3 . )    \\4 ) additionally , one can consider further combinations of some of the types of strategy ; see e.g. secs 6 and 8 .",
    "[ there have also been some advances @xcite in the matter time approach to tempus ante quantum . ]",
    "thus , all in all , one could view the present situation as the 22 strategies in figure 1 .",
    "bear in mind throughout that there are issues throughout these approaches as regards the extent to which each candidate time involved ( actual or emergent ) resembles the time of qt and that of gr .",
    "the issue of good and bad timefunctions / clock variables / clocks is quite an important theme in the present paper .",
    "e.g. @xcite have a number of criteria for , and examples of , good and bad timefunctions .    also , certainly each of the 10 strategies covered by isham and kucha ( fig 1 ) has problems if examined in detail @xcite .",
    "taking these as precedent , i consider it likely that subsequent strategies will also have great difficulty in being genuinely satisfactory ; this however remains undemonstrated in some cases .",
    "a resolution for the problem of time being acceptable would entail it to work in the general case for a fully viable theory of gravitation rather than just working for special cases or toy models .",
    "i in no way claim that this paper is exhaustive as regards what problems various strategies have ( e.g. @xcite cover plenty more such issues ) .    nor is the present article s coverage exhaustive ",
    "i expect to provide more thorough reviews ( and further original investigations of some of the strategies ) over the next 10 years .",
    "in particular , my accounts in the conclusion of the problem of time in the ashtekar variables , supergravity and string / m - theory settings are not exhaustive .",
    "consult the appendix if unfamiliar with any toy models mentioned in the main text .",
    "* ante postulate*. there is a fundamental time to be found at the classical level for the full ( i.e. untruncated ) classical gravitational theory ( possibly coupled to suitable matter fields ) .",
    "barbour s relational approach to physics gives rise to a jacobi  barbour  bertotti ( jbb ) time @xmath27 such that @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the kinetic term of the theory ( assumed to be purely quadratic ) and @xmath30 is a meaningless label time , cancelling with the other @xmath30 s present in @xmath29 . in the context of relational particle mechanics ( rpm s ,",

    "@xmath27 now amounts to , in various contexts , recovery of proper time and cosmic time .",
    "unfortunately , while this approach yields a time function , it does not in any way unfreeze the gr hamiltonian constraint or its energy constraint rpm analogue .",
    "however , this makes contact with another strategy ( the semiclassical aproach , sec 3.3 ) in which this same timestandard emerges in an an unfreezing context .",
    "take the indefinite direction in superspace to be picking out a timefunction , in parallel to how the indefinite direction in minkowski space does for e.g. klein  gordon theory .",
    "this amounts to one of the momenta on which @xmath36 depends quadratically to be taken to be conjugate to a timefunction , leading to a klein  gordon type wave equation depending on the double derivative with respect to this timefuction .",
    "this approach is usually billed as tempus post quantum , through choosing to make this identification of a time after the quantization , but the approach is essentially unchanged if this identification is made priorly at the classical level .",
    "regardless of when this identification is made , however , this approach fails , for reasons i defer to the discussion in its more habitual tempus post quantum setting ( sec 3.1 ) .",
    "while the above straightforward schemes fail , it may still be that a classical time exists but happens to be harder to find .",
    "we now consider starting one s scheme off by finding a way of solving @xmath36 to obtain a part - linear form , p_t^ + h^(x ; t^(x ) , q_^(x ) , p^_(x ) ] = 0 , [ plin ] where @xmath37 is the momentum conjugate to a candidate classical time variable , @xmath38 which is to play a role parallel to that of external classical time . by passing as soon as possible to having an object that plays such a role ,",

    "e.g. he has found that even small models are capable of forming records that are now imperfect .",
    "( they can not store substantial information about interactions , but can store at least some nontrivial information about interactions , e.g. a detector model that has one degree of freedom , see appendix a.8 ) .",
    "he makes use of wigner functions ( see e.g. @xcite ) and of semiclassical approach ideas ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these works mostly involve fairly standard models , with known wavefunctions allowing for computation of further useful objects @xcite such as the feynman ",
    "vernon influence functional .",
    "these systems have to date largely not had whole universe model connotations .",
    "these can be included without sacrificing computability by using rpm s ( though this remains work in progress of mine ) , which work can span all of histories theory , records theory and the semiclassical approach , making rpm s a good prospective arena in which to attempt to unite these .",
    "these began with @xcite ( though one might view @xcite as forerunners in some ways , see also @xcite ) .",
    "they involve various types of observables and related concepts , as defined below .",
    "an _ observable _ or _ constant of the motion _ or _",
    "perennial _ in classical canonical gr is any functional @xmath92 $ ] of the canonical variables whose poisson brackets with all the constraint functions vanish ( perhaps weakly @xcite ) . thus , for geometrodynamics",

    "[ oh0 ] ( this is a concept that goes back to dirac and bergmann ) .",
    "justification of the name ` constants of the motion ' follows from the hamiltonian for gr being @xmath93 : = \\int_{\\sigma } \\d^3x\\,(n{\\cal h } + n^{i}{\\cal h}_i)$ ] so that ( [ ohi0],[oh0 ] ) imply that [ h(t),(t ) ] = 0 .",
    "thus , observables are automatically constants of the motion with respect to evolution along the foliation associated with any choice of @xmath25 and @xmath94 .",
    "the quantum counterpart of these then involves some operator form for the canonical variables and commutators in place of poisson brackets .",
    "the operator - and - commutator counterparts of the above are then another manifestation of the frozen formalism problem of classical canonical gr ( some sort of ` heisenberg ' counterpart of the ` schrdinger ' wde being frozen ) .",
    "however , some quantum gravity practicioners consider that ( [ ohi0 ] ) alone may suffice , and thus drop requirement of ( [ oh0 ] ) ; this defines a _ kucha observable _ ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a _ true observable _ ( rovelli 1991 ) alias ( in 2002 ) _ complete observable _ also termed ( at least in @xcite ) _ evolving constant of the motion _ is an operation on a system that produces a number that can be predicted ( or whose probability distribution is predicted ) if the ( in the case of qt , heisenberg ) state of the system is known .",
    "this is as opposed to a _ partial observable _ ( rovelli 1991 ) , which is an operation on the system that produces a number , the number possibly being totally unpredictable even if the state is perfectly known .",
    "note that all of the above definitions were , more or less , in place by 1991 , though then early 90 s and 2000 s approaches do in part differ as to which of these definitions they use and how these definitions enter into creating strategies toward resolving the problem of time .",
    "rovelli argued that the ` evolving constants of motion ' form a particularly important class by which some notion of dynamical evolution can be introduced .",
    "the case of a simple model with just one constraint serves well to explain how such a scheme would work .",
    "here one has a toy model hamiltonian constraint @xmath95 defined on a finite - dimensional phase space @xmath96 .",
    "one then introduces some internal time @xmath97 such that @xmath98 , the hypersurface _ t = \\{(q , p)|t(q , p ) = t } intersects each dynamical trajectory ( on the constraint surface ) generated by @xmath85 exactly once .",
    "thus @xmath99 , and so the internal time @xmath100 itself is not a physical observable in the above sense .",
    "one then associates with each function @xmath101 a family of observables ( ` constants of motion ' ) @xmath102 , @xmath103 , defined by \\{f_t , h } = 0 , f_t|_s_t = f|_s_t [ 12 ] .",
    "thus , the observable @xmath104 on the subspace @xmath105 of @xmath96 .",
    "dynamical evolution with respect to @xmath100 then amounts to how the family of observables @xmath106 depends on @xmath16 . in this way , this scheme is @xcite a classical analogue of the heisenberg picture of qt .",
    "such a model could e.g. comprise a classical mechanics ( or minisuperspace ) model for which the role of time variable    has been taken over by an internal time @xmath100 .",
    "rovelli then suggested that these evolving constants of motion should form the basis for a heisenberg - style quantization    of the system .",
    "moreover , rovelli further argued that ( see also e.g. @xcite ) for quantum gravity such a heisenberg picture scheme remains meaningful whilst the schrdinger picture no longer is .",
    "two ways of applying these ideas toward building quantum gravity programs are as follows @xcite .",
    "implementation 1 ) use the group - theoretical scheme in @xcite , and hope that this produces a lie algebra of the @xmath102 , allowing one to then find a self - adjoint operator representation ( ` the quantum observables ' ) from obtaining unitary representations of the associated lie group .",
    "thus one would construct a physical hilbert space , giving one a probabilistic interpretation without having made any specific identification of time .",
    "implementation 2 ) start with a tempus post quantum scheme that uses an operator representation of the canonical commutation relations on some hilbert space @xmath107 .",
    "then physical state space @xmath108 consists of all vectors in @xmath107 that satisfy the operator constraints ( [ calh ] , [ calhi ] ) .",
    "then a physical observable is defined to be any operator @xmath109 $ ] that satisfies the commutator of operators analogue of ( [ ohi0 ] , [ oh0 ] ) [ or perhaps a weaker version in which these vanish only on the physical subspace . ]    some problems with the early 90 s forms are as follows .",
    "problem 7.1 - 1 . a common problem raised against type 2 ` rovelli ' timeless schemes ( which applies to both of the above implementations @xcite and to the subsequent ssec s , concerns not knowing how in general a sufficient set of concrete such physical observables are actually to be constructed .",

    "this is a large part of why kucha has advocated his definition of a weaker kind of observable . even at the classical level ,",

    "torre and anderson @xcite showed that observables for gr are necessarily highly nonlocal .",
    "problem 7.1 - 2 .",
    "furthermore , implementation 1 is a type of program for which sets of observables that generate a true lie algebra are rare .",
    "it is more likely for the algebra produced to be one not with structure constants but with nontrivial structure functions of the canonical variables .",
    "ordering ambiguities then make it difficult to find self - adjoint representations of such algebras @xcite .",
    "this is in particular due to difficulties with promoting to operator form the first condition in ( [ 12 ] ) [ in practise , this is likely to be an implicit function of @xmath110 , which entails the kind of problems in ssec [ ssec : isi ] ] .",
    "problem 7.1 - 3 .",
    "implementation 2 then additionally encounters an inner product problem @xcite .",
    "problem 7.1 - 4 . as the time function @xmath100",
    "invoked is an internal time , it is prone to global obstructions as per sec 2 .",
    "one may hope again that @xmath100 being a matter time rather than geometrodynamical could circumvent this in a satisfactory manner .",
    "problem 7.1 - 5 .",
    "hartle @xcite has further objected on grounds of the unlikeliness that a single hilbert space can be used for all possible choices of internal time function @xmath100 .",

    "hartle furthermore argues that this approach has a functional evolution problem , and that inconsistent time orderings arise within it .",
    "more recently , further suggestions have been made as regards extracting problem of time strategies from timeless notions of observables .",

    "e.g. similar ideas are present in the conditional probabilities interpretation / records theory programmes ; see sec 8.1 for further comparison of these strategies . ]",
    "thiemann @xcite gives the following argument ( see also rovelli @xcite for earlier work in this direction ) .",
    "let @xmath73 , @xmath74 be two non - observables that are , however , partial observables .",
    "then these are not then invariant under the gauge flow of the hamiltonian constraints .",
    "let their flows with respect to one of the hamiltonians be @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "then fix some parameter @xmath113 and invert the condition @xmath114 for t. next , insert the solution @xmath115 into the function @xmath116 and obtain @xmath117 .",
    "then @xmath117 is invariant under @xmath118 and is interpreted as the value of @xmath73 when @xmath74 has the value @xmath113 .",
    "thus , while neither @xmath73 or @xmath74 are invariant , we can construct a simple invariant @xmath117 which is frozen but still has a dynamical interpretation .",
    "this , thiemann argues , is  precisely how we perceive time in physics \" @xcite ( @xmath74 playing role of a time , @xmath100 ) , all that s actually observable being relative motions .",
    "thiemann then claims that @xmath113 moreover can be shown to have a canonical generator , i.e. a physical hamiltonian , which is completely independent from the hamiltonian constraint , itself being gauge invariant and not having to vanish on the constraint surface .",
    "parts of this scheme do have some conceptual similarities to the conditional probabilities interpretation ; note however that it is not tied to the specific conditional probabilities formula for extracting information about the correlations .",
    "the above is a line of work that pons and salisbury @xcite have supported .",
    "it is also used by a number of authors working toward loop quantum gravity .",
    "that gr has an infinity of hamiltonian constraints rather than just the one  time is a function of @xmath119 rather than a single number  causes a number of complications , can also be circumvented by thiemann s master constraint program @xcite in the ashtekar variables setting ( see ssec 8.3 for more about this ) .",
    "dittrich s alternative line of work @xcite has extended the early 90 s formulation and tied it to kucha s ` bubble time ' internal time scheme ( whence a number of global issues become apparent : problem 2.5 - 3 ) .",
    "this work is at the classical level .",
    "it does not contain many theory - dependent specifics , though it does include cylindrical waves midisuperspace as an example for which the scheme does work out ( as one might expect from the tie to internal time schemes ) .    some problems with the 2000 s forms are as follows .",
    "i begin by noting that the partial and complete observables concepts in terms of which the newer work is phrased have themselves already been part of rovelli s program in 1991 .",
    "thus , the presence of these concepts by themselves does not constitute a valid argument as to the inapplicability of the existing critiques to the newer work .",
    "the issue is , rather , on how these concepts are used in the building of new problem of time strategies that attention should be concentrated . by the 2000 s work being the early 90 s work plus additional ideas",
    ", a number of the critiques of the early 90 s work would be expected to carry over to the 2000 s work .",
    "[ how these strategies might get round the preceding criticisms whilst hopefully not generating any new criticisms , has not yet ( as far as i know ) been covered in detail in the literature . whilst i gather and form some such points below , i do not as yet have a definitive detailed critique , but merely pose that as a project that would be of current interest . ]",
    "some particular issues are as follows .",
    "problem 7.1 - 1  the problem of observables that finding full sets of explicit observables is a tough and as yet unanswered question  continues to be acknowledged in the more modern work of thiemann @xcite and dittrich @xcite . though i do point out that suggestions representing at least some progress @xcite have been made , albeit i do not have the space here to present and analyze this work in detail .",
    "i also point out that the increase in emphasis on partial observables deals with this problem since partial observables themselves are not problematic to find .",
    "problem 7.2 - 1 : how does the above partial observables approach square with the well - established theoretical issue ( c.f . page 4 ) that some clocks / timefunctions are better than others ?",
    "thiemann @xcite admits that it may not be easy to find suitable clock variables .",
    "rovelli furthermore argues in e.g. @xcite for relative motion of variables to be a democratic issue in the sense that any @xmath73 can serve as a timestandard for any @xmath74 , rather than there being some privileged subset of reliable timestandards .",
    "moreover , he uses newtonian mechanics as an example of such a scheme .",
    "however , this particular example does not take into account @xcite that newtonian mechanics makes use not of democratic timestandards but rather of a meritocratic timestandard : the newtonian time is used since it exhibits the advantageous property that the equations of motion are particularly simple with respect to it .",
    "nevertheless , the democracy argument is probably in fact intended for generic gr .",
    "a further issue is that if one does argue to use any @xmath73 as a timestandard for any @xmath74 , then one may stand to lose the distinction between observables and purported timestandards at the level of quantum operators that permits such purported timestandards to indeed turn out to be good timestandards at the quantum level .",
    "possible problem 7.2 - 2 .",
    "might the inversion in the second part of this ssec be problematic in general to explicitly perform ?",
    "problem 7.2 - 3 .",
    "thiemann @xcite and dittrich @xcite acknowledge that finding observables ( not taken to include partial observables ) is further complicated by global issues ( which amount to a global problem of time ) ; this remains particularly clear due to the connections with internal time approaches persisting from the early 90 s schemes into 2000 s schemes .",
    "moreover , rovelli @xcite argues that the location with respect to the matter in models with matter makes the partial observables approach more straightforward .",
    "problem 7.2 - 4 .",
    "however ( in many ways similarly to problem 2.6 - 2 ) , it is not clear whether reference fluids / clouds of clocks meaningfully exist .    on the other hand , using a such",
    "could ( in parallel with sec 2.6 ) remove the global problem .",
    "` time ' means incompatible things in each of general relativity ( gr ) and quantum theory ( qt ) , which is problematic in trying to put these two theories together to form a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "that time goes missing in attempting to write down a canonical formulation for quantum gravity evokes the various strategies of          \\iv ) ditching the notion of time for the notion of history instead , and re - starting the canonical quantization process using these instead of configurations .",
    "moreover , the above ` frozen formalism problem ' is but one of a number of facets of the problem of time , which i have argued form a coherent whole ( ` ice dragon ' ) due to stemming jointly from the crisis that gr and qt have relied upon mutually incompatible notions of ` time ' .",
    "the above problems , and strategies were subjected to detailed critical review in the early 90 s by kucha and isham @xcite .",
    "the present article covers a number of subsequent advances in the strategies .",

    "i have made a number of proposals involving timeless records , with records also being found and studied within histories theory by gell - mann and hartle , and halliwell .",
    "as some useful contrast , there are some parallels between ` rovelli'-type approaches and page  wootters original conditional probabilities interpretation @xcite . both involve notions of observables , and of subsequent pairings of such , with the one then serving as a clock for the other",
    ". however , rovelli s scheme is less specific in not postulating a rigid formula like the conditional probabilities interpretation one for the extraction of the information about the correlation between the two observables .",
    "also , rovelli insists that only the heisenberg picture remains meaningful for quantum gravity , by which type 1 approaches such as the conditional probabilities interpretation / records theory could not be just the same physics as type 2 ` rovelli ' but in a different picture .",
    "( though it is not clear , at least to me , whether this insistence is absolutely necessary ; attempting to lift it might reveal further approaches to the problem of time , or further connections between existing approaches , such as between type 2 ` rovelli ' and type 1 timeless approaches .",

    "( does the heisenberg picture alone remaining meaningful entail some features of this ?",

    "do any of these perform substantially differently from in ordinary geometrodynamics ?",
    "i first note that some problem of time strategies are _ universal _ in the sense that they take formats that exist no matter what the underlying theory is ( thus this point applies in the next two subsections as well ) .",
    "one case of this is that whatever theory has semiclassical , , conditional probabilities interpretation , records , histories , and ` rovelli ' timeless types of strategies .",
    "another case of this is that approaches based on mastering the diffeomorphisms are widely blocked from progress .",
    "( though some toy models have simpler entities than the diffeomorphisms , and it may not be clear with what the notion of diffeomorphisms is replaced in discrete theories , though these would then be required to at least approximately reproduce the notion of diffeomorphism in suitable ` spacetime ' limits . )    in affine geometrodynamics @xcite , the unreduced hilbert space changes , as does the specific form of the wde , though it remains a frozen equation . as regards tempus ante quantum approaches ,",
    "solving for the time at the classical level is before there is any plain  affine distinction .",
    "there may however still be some scope for different commutation relations subsequently arising .",
    "as regards tempus post quantum affine approaches , these include an analogue of superspace time ( as the signature of the wave equation is unaltered by passing to the affine approach ) .",
    "as regards the subsequent inner product issue , the potential not respecting the conformal killing vector is an issue that occurs at the classical level , so that the non - useability of a klein  gordon inner product carries through to the affine case .",
    "i am not aware of third quantization having been tried in this case , but a number of reasons for it not appearing to be very promising as a problem of time resolution do look to carry over to the affine case .",
    "the should not care about such a change , since this approach does not make use of the wde . as the does work in a wheeler  dewitt framework",
    "@xcite , this will change in detail .",
    "the start of records theory involves notions of distance and of information at the classical level , which are unaffected by this change , though subsequent changes would then be expected at the quantum level .",
    "a histories theory approach to affine geometrodynamics was considered by kessari @xcite .",
    "observables approaches are , in any case , geared toward the loop quantum gravity setting ( though it would still be interesting to see how these approaches do in the geometrodynamical setting ) .",
    "@xcite indicates that affine version of evolving constants of the motion exists .",

    "the above form is the early complex ashtekar variables as opposed to the more modernly used real ashtekar variables with their immirzi parameter ambiguity .",
    "as the ashtekar variables hamiltonian constraint is still of quadratic and not linear form , it too has a frozen formalism problem .",
    "elsewise , this form of the constraint is simpler than the geometrodynamical form of the hamiltonian constraint .",

    "kucha @xcite only provides a critique of the early complex version . a quantum spin dynamics version @xcite and the master constraint program @xcite ( also known as the ` phoenix project ' )",
    "have been developed since .",

    "thus , reliance on rovelli s book to constitute a resolution of the problem of time , as is becoming commoner in the literature , is not by itself a currently - justifiable argument .",
    "one should furthermore bear in mind that further work along the lines of the main suggestions in @xcite has also been done by e.g. thiemann and dittirch , though it remains unclear , at least to me , whether their work makes significant further progress in resolving the ( full meaning of the ) problem of time .",
    "in particular , thiemann @xcite vouches for partial and complete observables ( of type 2 ` rovelli ' approaches being ( much of ) how the problem of time is to be treated in loop quantum gravity .",

    "] at the quantum level , however , thiemann @xcite cautions that what he is doing is to present an idea , and one that is strongly tied to the master constraint program for the loop quantum gravity approach to quantum gr ( which would therefore appear not to be aiming for a universal resolution by which type 2 ` rovelli ' timeless approaches become fully satisfactory answers to the problem of time ) . the master constraint program s considerably superior mathematical machinery does present a much more viable quantization approach as compared to the technical problems ( 7.1 - 2 , 7.1 - 3 ) incurred by earlier type 2 ` rovelli ' timeless approaches .",

    "( @xcite discusses third quantization of a supergravity theory with some parallels to the passage from first - quantized string theory to string field theory . )",
    "the semiclassical approach for supergravity has been considered in @xcite .",
    "i am not aware of any timeless approach or histories theory work for supergravity , but this would be expected to be doable on grounds of universality ( what is not clear without actually doing these is whether supergravity allows for one to get _ any further _ than gr with such approaches providing resolutions of the problem of time ) .",
    "the presence of background structure means that one can take there to be no problem of time at the level of perturbative string theory .",
    "1 ) the string effective action gives a gr - like theory and thus possesses a wheeler - dewitt type equation , at least at scales somewhat larger than the planck length @xcite .",
    "2 ) a number of technical as well as conceptual issues then drive one to seek nonperturbative background - independent formulations , and then problem of time issues resurface .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for a recent classical canonical formulation of m - theory .",
    "the membrane form of m - theory certainly has diffeomorphism issues .",
    "the bosonic string has also been studied as a toy model of geometrodynamics @xcite [ this also covers the histories brackets approach ] , being simpler in the sense that its _ 2-@xmath91 worldsheet _ diffeomorphisms are simpler than gr s 4-@xmath91 spacetime ones .",
    "it would then be interesting to extend that work to the superstring , the membrane and the supermembrane .",
    "another interesting question with problem of time implications is what happens to the notion of diffeomorphism when one passes from the membrane form of m - theory to the matrix form .",
    "@xcite looks to be along the lines of a quantum - level records theory , due to its being based on finding distances between states in the _ quantum _ space of states .",
    "the main obtacle here is that the space of states in question is very formidable mathematically ( it arises as generalization of how @xmath126 arises in the study of ordinary mechanics quantum states ) , so it is unclear how far one can get with this approach . as such , it may be worth considering how satisfactory this approach is as a problem of time approach in the given toy model of the space of quantum states in ordinary qt , and then in some progression of models of intermediate difficulty .",
    "( it is also as yet unclear whether the geometrodynamics and ashtekar variables cases of such a scheme are more or less mathematically involved than these authors m - theory case . )",
    "the argument about how the existence of killing vectors poses a global obstruction to hidden times looks extendible to the m - theory context . also , reference fluid times would now be inappropriate due to clashing with m - theory s fundamentality ; the possibility of a unimodular time might however remain open .",
    "one would not expect there to be much if any profit to applying a semiclassical scheme directly to m - theory ; it ought to suffice to work with the much more conventional effective string action , or for supergravity with 10 spatial dimensions ( itself regarded as a semiclassical limit of m - theory ) .",
    "thus ( extensions of ) the work mentioned in the preceding ssec should be of interest as an emergent approach to the problem of time in m - theory ( and there could be some scope for problem of time results for supergravity carrying over to m - theory . )",
    "the idea of third - quantizing and/or summing over membrane - histories could well retain their usual merits .",
    "some spacetime reconstruction issues in string theory are covered in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the new specific forms taken by various approaches to m - theory could well lend themselves to suggesting further strategies for resolving the problem of time .",
    "i will briefly comment on two possible such features .",
    "firstly , the possibility of theories of this kind having two time dimensions has been considered .",
    "this would certainly change the nature of most problem of time strategies , and indeed of the nature of most properties of time , posing challenges for the philosophy of time more generally . for the moment",
    "i caution that , at the classical level , having two time dimensions has very unfortunate effects as regards well - posedness of the field equations , and even as regards the nature of causality .",
    "secondly , i consider whether the ads  cft conjecture may furbish a resolution of the problem of time . on the one hand , this might be precluded by the cft boundary amounting to a sufficient vestige of background structure ( so that this would still be akin to resolving the problem of time in an asymptotically flat universe by anchoring the notion of time to that notion of time which is asymptotically privileged ) . on the other hand ,",
    "both the mathematics of the correspondence and its physical interpretation may be sufficiently different from the situation in asymptotically flat geometrodynamics .",
    "then the presence of a privileged time , and unitary evolution , in the cft would point to corresponding notions in the bulk spacetime theory , and it would then be very interesting to work out what these are in terms of the language of the bulk spacetime theory itself .",
    "this would presumably give some sort of internal time , of a form not found by prior investigations not making use of the ads ",
    "cft correspondence , perhaps because of taking a highly nonlocal form in the spacetime language , or perhaps because of novelty in the form of the spacetime theory involved .",
    "however , one might conversely suspect that for sufficiently general bulk spacetime theory , then the mismatch between such spacetime theories generically having a problem of time and cft s having a privileged notion of time amounts to these theories being of sufficiently different nature that no correspondence could bridge between the two .",
    "thus , while ads  cft might resolve the problem of time , the problem of time might also render ads ",
    "cft absurd , or at least limit the range of situations for which such a correspondence does exist . the most pertinent question",
    "then would be whether any models of sufficient generality to encompass all observational gravitational physics can fit within models that do exhibit an ads ",
    "cft correspondence .",

    "full quantum gr is technically difficult , so more progress may be made for toy models @xcite .",
    "toy models vary in which ways they closely resemble gr .",
    "such toys have some , but not other of the following crucial features of gr : infinite - dimensional and curved configuration spaces , indefinite kinetic terms , the presence of a linear momentum constraint , issues specific to the diffeomorphisms and their canonical split and algebra , the presence of a complicated and specific potential term , and the high nonlinearity of gr s equations of motion .",
    "toy models for the problem of time should not be linearly ranked due to the many ways in which each can possess a partial set of these gr - like features .",
    "one should beware extrapolation from toy models , due many proposals tractable for a toy model then turning out to be specifically tied to non - generalizable features of that toy model .",
    "also , the lack of certain gr - like features in some models can render some aspects of the problem of time trivial , impossible , undemonstrable or absurd therein .",
    "general rules of thumb concerning pros and cons of toy models for the problem of time are as follows .",
    "1 ) finite models do not exhibit the functional evolution problem 2 ) finite models do not exhibit the worst of the technical qft problems , e.g. nonrenormalizability .",
    "thus , here some of the conceptual issues can be discussed in a technical framework that is mathematically well - defined .",
    "the main limitation of these models is the absence of well - behaved perturbative schemes based around them .",
    "3 ) models in which the dynamical entities do not include some sort of physical space will not have diffeomorphism issues or spacetime reconstruction issues .",
    "4 ) semiclassical , timeless and histories approaches exist in highly model - independent form , so all manner of toy models will possess such schemes .",
    "5 ) on the other hand , internal time candidates of some types will be tied to the the structure of the particular model in question .",
    "6 ) matter time only really makes sense in gravitational contexts in which the appropriate kind of matter can be coupled in ( though parts of the calculation do have counterparts in e.g. electromagnetic theory ) .",
    "7 ) superspace time / klein  gordon    approach / third quantization only make sense for models with indefinite kinetic terms .",
    "8) nonrelativistic particle/ parametrized relativistic field , and models that have natural choices of embedding variables have no multiple choice problem .    for toy models consisting of coupled oscillators , stationary states ,",
    "parametrized nonrelativistic particles or fields , and relativistic particles , see @xcite and references therein , since there has not been much progress since then from using these . on the other hand",
    ", there have been significant developments concerning toy models that consist of 2 + 1 gravity , relational particle models ( rpm s ) , bosonic strings , detectors , and information gathering and utilizing systems ( igus ) ( see below for explanations of what all of these are ) .",
    "i discuss these below including minisuperspace and midisuperspace toy models too as these provide important comparisons , are certainly still actively used , and have ashtekar variables @xcite , supergravity @xcite and stringy scenario counterparts ( see e.g. @xmath127 ) , though midisuperspace modelling of all of these is still in its infancy .",
    "ashtekar variables and string / m - theory have their own additional toy models ( it is not clear how much these toy models have to say about the problem of time ) .",
    "this is a well - known toy model of superspace @xcite ; it involves consideration of just the homogeneous spatial 3-geometries .",
    "thus it is finite , and does not possess a notion of inhomogeneity / structure / localization or a nontrivial momentum constraint .",
    "the restriction of the gr supermetric to minisuperspace is a @xmath128 symmetric array rather than the full case s @xmath129 one at each space point .",
    "minisuperspace does inherit specific potentials and kinetic term indefiniteness from gr .",
    "minisuperspace is used e.g. to illustrate the klein  gordon and square - root schrdinger approaches inequivalence@xcite , simple scale , york and matter internal time models @xcite , and histories theory approaches @xcite .",
    "it is also around as far as most work on loop quantum cosmology gets as regards nontriviality .",
    "strong gravity @xcite can be viewed as the ` @xmath130 ' or ` @xmath131 ' limit of gr .",
    "this is the carrollian limit in which the lorentzian lightcone becomes squeezed into a line as points become entirely isolated due to the zero speed of physical signals ( which is the opposite of the galilean limit , in which the lorentzian lightcone becomes squashed into a plane of simultaneity due to the infinite speed of physical signals . ) thus strong gravity consists of entirely isolated worldlines , and is most commonly interpreted as ultralocal physics ( no spatial derivatives ) .",
    "thus @xmath36 loses the ricci scalar term here .",
    "@xmath13 needs to be retained to ensure that the theory is nontrivial ; strictly , one is taking the ` @xmath130 ' limit while ` keeping @xmath132 constant ' to arrive at theories of strong gravity .",
    "ultralocal models require a nonstandard form of renormalization @xcite , which may be useful for gravitational physics and is closely tied to the affine approach to geometrodynamics .",
    "as regards problem of time applications , if one contemplates a klein  gordon inner product for strong gravity , unlike for gr the potential is of a fixed sign , and thus directly analogous with the standard klein ",
    "gordon equation ( or the tachyonic one , depending on the sign of the @xmath13 ` mass ' ) .",
    "thus the klein  gordon type inner product ought to be normalizable .",
    "the issue of the positive  negative modes split of states is then resolved because there _ is _ a timelike superspace conformal killing vector .",
    "attempts to expand perturbatively about this by including a small ricci scalar term have remained been mired in difficulties .",
    "it can also be used as an internal time model .",
    "more realistic midisuperspace models ( simple infinite models ) such as einstein ",
    "rosen cylindrical waves @xcite , spherically symmetrical models @xcite ( including some models with shells @xcite have been studied . while these models are infinite - d , inhomogeneous gr models , they possess ( usually fairly large ) isometry groups and so are still rather simpler than the general gr case .",
    "midisuperspace is very useful for the problem of time , albeit at the cost of being the hardest sort of toy model to do calculations with .",
    "einstein  rosen models and spherical models possess extrinsic internal times , and have been used for matter time @xcite and observables @xcite approaches .",
    "this lies just to the infinite side of the finite  infinite frontier .",
    "this has been done for linear perturbations ( first by @xcite though the calculations have been somewhat efficientized since ; the corresponding second - order calculation remains daunting ) .",
    "the principal problem of time strategy application of this model to date is the semiclassical approach ( see e.g. the critique of @xcite ) .",
    "it should also be noted that this model suffices at least for some purposes for actual study of the origin of galaxies or of microwave background perturbations .",
    "see @xcite for a large review of quantum gravity in @xmath133 dimensions . this is simpler than in 3 + 1 dimensions due to e.g. being flat and having no local degrees of freedom ( there are still global degrees of freedom ) . it does however continue to have a number of nontrivial features of 3 + 1 gravity , in particular it retains nontrivial diffeomorphisms .",
    "2 + 1 models are useful e.g. to illustrate nonuniqueness of the resultant quantum thory , internal time , breakdown of the saddle approximation underlying the semiclassical approach @xcite , and in testing a number of loop quantum gravity ideas e.g. @xcite .",
    "these are treated in a suitable canonical form in @xcite .",
    "they are models with a 1-d space of extent .",
    "thus , they serve as toy models of some aspects of the diffeomorphisms , and also of the history brackets approach with a space map as well as a time map .",
    "rpm s are mechanical theories in which only relative times , relative angles and ( ratios of ) relative separations have physical meaning .",
    "rpm s have a quadratic energy constraint that manifests the frozen formalism problem .",
    "rpm s also have linear constraints corresponding to rotations [ and sometimes scalings ] .",
    "thus rpm s involve a ` relational space ' = @xmath134 analogue of superspace(@xmath2 ) = riem(@xmath2)/diff(@xmath2 ) [ and a ` shape space ' = @xmath135 analogue of cs(@xmath2 ) = riem(@xmath2)/diff(@xmath2 ) @xmath136 conf(@xmath2 ) ] .",
    "is the spatial dimension of the model and @xmath25 is the total number of particles ; it is @xmath25  1 that appears in these configuration spaces due to trivial removal of the translations .",
    "rot(@xmath91 ) is the group of @xmath91-dimensional rotations , and dil is the group of dilatations . ]",
    "rpm s also have a notion of structure / inhomogeneity by which they are a useful toy model of some midisuperspace features even if @xmath91 = 1 . for @xmath137 or 2 ( for which nontrivial analogy with geometrodynamics still holds ) , rpm s have simple configuration space mathematics : shape space = @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively , with the corresponding relational spaces being the cones over these ( which , in the former case , are simply @xmath140 ) .",
    "this renders these rpm s particularly solvable , making them useful for investigating numerous problem of time strategies , and comparisons between , and compositions of , these strategies .",
    "the above spaces become quotiented by @xmath141 if one identifies mirror - image shapes ; this case more closely parallels affine geometrodynamics , and , for triangle configurations , amounts to imposing a signed area in parallel to the det(@xmath3 ) @xmath19 0 condition .",
    "rpm s with scale included have an euler time that is a dilational time , i.e. a counterpart of gr s york time , and are analogous to halliwell  hawking s scheme @xcite for inhomogeneous perturbations about homogeneous semiclassical quantum gr .",
    "moreover , this now has a rather simpler shape dynamics coupled to the dominant scale dynamics , which is useful in qualitative investigations of the appropriateness of the semiclassical approach . unlike gr , rpm s are finite , positive - definite , and are highly free in what form their potential takes ( but this can be largely used up to align the models to share dynamics of scale with quantum cosmology ) .",
    "rpm s are also a useful arena for investigating records theory , due to their possessing readily useable notions of locality in space ( clumping ) and configuration space ( from being positive - definite )",
    ". thus , finally rpm s will be useful for investigation of the combination of semiclassical , records and histories theory ideas ( histories theory being guaranteed to be formulable for rpm s due to its universality ) .",
    "halliwell @xcite coupled such as an up  down detector to a mechanics model , and also separately included a harmonic oscillator detector within one s mechanics model .",
    "this can hold information about one fourier mode in the signal , thus exemplifying that even very simple systems can make imperfect records .",
    "these @xcite are possibly a competitor with midisuperspace for maximum realism , from which they very greatly differ .",
    "does quantum gr admit any solutions that contain such ?",
    "these are a class of toy model that one would like to have for timeless and histories theory approaches , but it is far from clear how to make such models from a practical perspective .",
