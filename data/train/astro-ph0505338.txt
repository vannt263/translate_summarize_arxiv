    "from the classical perspective , spectral states of black hole binaries are classified into two classes ( e.g. , tanaka  1997 and references therein ) .",
    "one is the low / hard state in which x - ray spectra are represented by a single power - law with an exponential cut - off around several tens of kev to 100  kev .",
    "this low state is realized when the mass accretion rate is relatively low .",
    "the other is the high / soft state , which is known as a high accretion - rate state . in the high / soft state ,",
    "x - ray spectra consist of a dominant soft component and a power - law tail .",
    "the dominant soft component is believed to be from the radiatively efficient , optically thick , geometrically thin disk ( the `` standard disk '' , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) reaching the innermost stable orbit around a central black hole .",
    "in fact , when the soft component is fitted with a `` multi - color disk '' model ( mcd model or diskbb in xspec ; mitsuda et al .  1984 ) that approximates the standard accretion disk by ignoring its inner boundary condition , the obtained inner radius is kept remarkably constant against any large intensity variation ( e.g. , makishima et al .  1986 ; tanaka  1989 ; takizawa  1991 ; ebisawa et al .",
    "1993 , 1994 ) .",
    "moreover , in many black hole binaries , including cyg  x-1 ( dotani et al .",
    "1997 ) , once the true inner radius , @xmath9 , is estimated by the mcd fit , it is found to be consistent with @xmath10 , with black hole mass @xmath11 ) , which is the last stable orbit for a non - spinning black hole , here , from an apparent inner radius , @xmath12 , one of two fit parameters of the mcd , the true inner radius , @xmath9 , can be calculated as @xmath13 with an inner boundary correction factor , @xmath14 ( kubota et al .  1998 ) , and a correction factor of spectral hardening , @xmath152.0 ( shimura & takahara 1995 ) . after this standard view was established ,",
    "recent spectral studies of black hole binaries have revealed that there seems to be three sub - statuses in the high / soft states : the standard regime , anomalous regime ( or `` weak very high state '' ; see below ) , and apparently standard regime , in the order of increasing the mass accretion rate ( kubota , makishima & ebisawa 2001 ; kubota & makishima  2004 ) .",
    "the standard regime corresponds to the classical high / soft state where the inner radius is kept constant under canonical modeling of the mcd plus power - law .",
    "the anomalous regime is characterized by thermal inverse compton scattering by high - temperature electrons around the optically thick disk that extends down to @xmath16 , and by the existence of type - b qpos ( e.g. , van der klis  2004 ; remillard et al .",
    "this anomalous regime is basically the same as a very high state ( vhs ; miyamoto et al .",
    "1991 ) , which was redefined as a steep power - law state by mcclintock & remillard ( 2003 ) , and thus the anomalous regime was renamed as a weak vhs by kubota & done ( 2004 ) .",
    "though the soft disk component no longer dominates the hard spectral component , the standard disk picture is still justified for the underlying optically thick disk in this anomalous regime ( kubota et al .",
    "2001 ; kubota & makishima  2004 ) . together with these three stable sub - states in the high state",
    ", there seems to be an intermediate case , called an intermediate state in the literature , or a strong vhs by kubota & done ( 2004 ) , at an occasion of the low - to - high transition .",
    "the spectral shape of the apparently standard regime , the most luminous regime , resembles that of the classical high / soft state , and consists of the dominant soft component and a very weak power - law tail .",
    "however , the apparent disk inner radius , @xmath12 , obtained under the mcd fit is _ not _ constant , but varies as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the highest color temperature of the disk , while it is kept constant in the standard regime . plainly , the data in the apparently standard regime are _ not _ consistent with a constant inner radius , constant emissivity and constant colour temperature correction , which are justified in the standard regime .",
    "we here define this inconstancy of @xmath12 in the apparently standard regime as a deviation from the simple standard picture .",
    "this deviation is now commonly seen in black hole binaries in the most luminous case , including gro j@xmath6 ( kubota , makishima , & ebisawa  2001 ) and 4u  @xmath19 ( abe et al .",
    "2005 ) . beyond our galaxy and large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ,",
    "the apparently standard regime has also been suggested in off - nuclear ultra - luminous ( @xmath20 ) compact x - ray sources in nearby galaxies ( hereafter ulxs ; makishima et al .",
    "2000 ; fabbiano  1989 ) . that is to say ,",
    "the ulxs often show the mcd - type spectra , and the values of @xmath12 are not kept constant , but proportional to @xmath21 ( mizuno , kubota & makishima 2001 ) , like black hole binaries in the apparently standard regime .",
    "this deviation can be interpreted as a break of the standard disk ( kubota & makishima 2004 ) , or can also be caused by a different color temperature correction ( gierli@xmath22ski & done 2004 ) . as is done for xte  j@xmath23 by kubota & makishima ( 2004 ) ,",
    "the break of the standard disk is considered in detail by investigating the local temperature gradient of the disk with a so - called @xmath0-free disk model ( a local model for xspec ; kubota & makishima 2004 ) , with which the spectrum consists of the sum of blackbody emission with a local temperature of @xmath24 ( @xmath2 is a distance from a central object ) . in the newtonian metric",
    ", the local effective temperature of the standard disk is given as @xmath25 with the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath26 , and the mass accretion rate , @xmath27 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : tr ] exemplifies the temperature profile of the standard disk .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-value is expected to be @xmath28 by ignoring the boundary condition at @xmath29 .",
    "this is the case of the mcd model ( mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) . with another cooling process",
    ", the @xmath0-value is predicted to become smaller than @xmath28 ( e.g. , watarai et al .",
    "figure  [ fig : mo ] exemplifies the 0.710  kev spectra of the @xmath0-free disk model with @xmath0=0.5 , 0.75(=3/4 ) and 1.0 .",
    "this figure shows that the @xmath0-free disk with a smaller value of @xmath0 reveals an x - ray spectrum in which the soft energy band is more enhanced than the standard disk of @xmath8 .",
    "however , as already pointed out by kubota & makishima  ( 2004 ) , even in the standard accretion disk , the observed value of @xmath0 is expected to be slightly different from @xmath28 due to ( 1 ) the disk inner boundary condition ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tr ] ) , ( 2 ) general relativistic effects , and ( 3 ) the disk vertical structure including electron scattering .",
    "therefore , to discuss the break of the standard disk , knowledge of the temperature profile of the standard disk must be required .",
    "it is thus important to obtain an observationally acceptable range of @xmath0 in well - known black hole binaries in the standard high / soft state ( standard regime ) , where the radiatively efficient standard disk is justified . with this perspective",
    ", this paper presents a detailed study of the spectral shape of the standard - state galactic / magellanic black hole binaries observed with the gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ; ohashi et al .",
    "1996 ; makishima et al .",
    "1996 ) onboard _ asca_. the _ asca _ gis has a fine spectral capability in the range of 0.710  kev , and is free from pile - up , even for the bright ( x - ray flux of @xmath30  crab ) galactic objects .",
    "therefore , the gis is the best detector to examine the structure of the optically thick accretion disk around bright galactic / magellanic black hole binaries in detail . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the spectral shape by using the @xmath0-free disk model , following previous reports .    before the present work ,",
    "information of our sample is summarized in   2 . in   3 and   4 ,",
    "the observed data are analyzed , and the results are summarized . in   5 , the observational result is briefly discussed in comparison with the standard disk picture and the latest models for the radiatively efficient , geometrically thin disks .",
    "many black hole binaries were observed with _ asca _ in their high / soft state ( e.g. , cyg x-1 , grs @xmath31 , lmc x-1 , lmc x-3 , gro j@xmath6 , grs @xmath32 , xte j@xmath5 , xte  j@xmath23 , and 4u  @xmath19 ) . in this paper , the _ asca _ gis spectra of lmc x-1 , lmc x-3 , xte j@xmath5 and gro j@xmath6 are reanalyzed based on the @xmath0-free disk model .",
    "they all show characteristics of the standard high / soft state , and show an inner temperature of @xmath33 kev , ensuring that their wien shoulders of local diluted blackbody radiation at the inner edge of the disk appear at @xmath34 kev .",
    "in addition , the absorption columns of @xmath35 are not too high ( @xmath36 ) to study the disk spectra in detail .",
    "_ data of xte  j@xmath23 are not included , because they characterize the vhs ( kubota & done 2004 ) rather than the classical high / soft state . in table",
    "[ tab : obs ] , the observation logs of these four sources are shown with the estimated central object mass , inclination angles , @xmath37 , and distances , @xmath38 .",
    "the large mass of the central objects in lmc  x-3 , lmc  x-1 , and gro  j@xmath6 fiducially measured from binary motion , makes these three objects confirmed black holes ( e.g. , mcclintock and remillard 2003 ) , and x - ray data of xte  j@xmath5 characterize its nature as an accreting black hole in the classical high / soft state .    for each source",
    ", the gis events were extracted from a circular region of @xmath39 radius centered on the image peak , after selecting good time intervals in a standard procedure .",
    "average energy spectra were constructed from the two gis detectors .",
    "for the two galactic sources , xte  j@xmath5 and gro  j@xmath6 , the high bit - rate data were analyzed after correcting the dead time in reference to the count - rate monitor data ( makishima et al .",
    "the medium bit - rate data were not used , because even the monitor scaler was overflown and a dead - time correction was not possible . a systematic error of 1% is included to each energy bin of the spectra , in order to account for calibration uncertainties .",
    "because the two lmc sources are much dimmer , both the high bit - rate data and the medium bit - rate data are utilized , and the systematic error is not included .",
    "a background was completely negligible compared to the fluxes of the galactic sources , and thus was not subtracted .",
    "for lmc sources , the background is not negligible , and is constructed from a source - free region of the gis field of view .",
    "there were simultaneous _",
    "observations corresponding to the _ asca _ observations of xte  j@xmath5 and gro  j@xmath6 , on 1998 may 29 and 1997 february 26 respectively .",
    "the _ rxte _",
    "pca data are very useful to estimate the power - law contribution , which is critical to examine the spectral shape of the dominant soft component with the @xmath0-free disk model .",
    "we used heasoft  5.2 in which systematic difference in calibration of gis and pca pointed e.g. , by done , madejski , zycki  ( 2000 ) was corrected .",
    "thus , for these two sources , the _ rxte _ pca data were simultaneously analyzed with the _ asca _ gis data . for the pca data reduction , a top layer was used from all five units , using standard exclusion criteria ( target elevation less than @xmath40 above the limb of the earth ; pointing direction more than 1.2 arcmin from the target ; data acquired within 30 minutes after spacecraft passage through south atlantic anomaly ) .",
    "the background was estimated for each observation using the software package pcabackest ( version 2.1e ) , supplied by the rxte guest observer s facility at nasa / gsfc .",
    "a response matrix was made for each observation by utilizing the software package pcarsp version 8.0 . in order to take into account the calibration uncertainties , a systematic error of 1%",
    "was added to each bin of the pca spectra .",
    "the 320 kev data were used in the present work , because there is sometimes a residual structure in the 2035 kev range associated with the xe - k edge at 30 kev .",

    "observations of this source were performed 24 times ; vasiliev , trudolyubov & revnivtsev  ( 2000 ) reported that the inner disk radius is kept constant under the canonical mcd plus power - law model .",

    "the 320 kev _ rxte _ pca spectrum and the 0.710 kev _ asca _ gis spectrum were jointly analyzed .",
    "the overall spectrum was first examined with the mcd plus power - law model . except for a normalization factor ,",
    "all of the model parameters were constrained to be the same between the gis and the pca data . both these components were assumed to undergo absorption with a common column density , @xmath35 .",

    "the successful fitting of the canonical model means that the temperature gradient does not conflict with @xmath8 , which is the case of the mcd .",

    "if the schwarzschild potential is applied instead of the newtonian potential , the difference of the temperature profile around the inner boundary becomes more significant .",
    "a general relativistic accretion disk model ( grad model in the xspec ; ebisawa , mitsuda & hanawa  1993 ; hanawa  1989 ) calculates the local effective temperature of the standard accretion disk in the schwarzschild potential as @xmath86^{1/4}~~~. \\label{eq : tr_s}\\ ] ] in fig .",

    "in addition to the difference of @xmath87 , the gravitational redshift and the doppler boosting are the main relativistic effect ; the latter appears most clearly in the dependence of the observed spectra on the inclination angle , @xmath37 . in order to test both the inner boundary condition and the general relativistic effects in the schwarzschild metric",
    ", the @xmath0-values are calculated based on the grad spectra under the 0.710  kev gis response matrices . in detail , many grad spectra are simulated for several conditions of @xmath37 and @xmath27 , and are fitted with the @xmath0-free disk model and the mcd model . to compare the observational results shown in fig .",

    ", the values of @xmath0 are distributed between 0.580.7 .",
    "these results show that the relativistic effects under the schwarzschild metric and the boundary condition make @xmath0 _ smaller _ than @xmath28 up to @xmath92 . by comparing fig .",

    "the consistency of the @xmath0-values between the observations and the grad calculations means that the disk vertical structure , which is not included in the grad model , should not change the spectral shape very much .",
    "therefore , the assumption concerning the sum of the local diluted blackbody radiations with a radially constant hardening factor , @xmath96 , is justified for black hole binaries in the standard high / soft state .",
    "otherwise , the vertical structure can shift the @xmath0-value to slightly _ larger _ , as marginally suggested in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha : i - t ] .    is this observational result consistent with the current models for a geometrically thin disk that includes the disk vertical structure ? even within the standard disk picture , electron scattering in the disk direction",
    "is expected to be important .",
    "since electron scattering under optically thick conditions usually becomes more important for higher temperature ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , emission from the higher temperature inner part of the disk may be suppressed more than the lower temperature outer part .",
    "thus , with electron scattering , the @xmath0-value roughly becomes smaller than the standard value of @xmath28 .",
    "the real disk is much more complicated , and thus such a brief estimation may not be realistic .",
    "in fact , the disk spectra that take account for electron scattering have been computed by many authors , including shimura & takahara 1995 , ross & fabbian ( 1996 ) , and merloni , fabbian & ross ( 2000 ) , on many conditions .",
    "recently , significant theoretical advances have been made in understanding the nature and the vertical structure of the optically - thick and geometrically - thin disk .",
    "turner  ( 2004 ) shows that magnetic stress should play an important role in the disk , and is considered to make the radiatively efficient disk stable .",
    "bound - free metal opacity is also thought to be important ( davis et al .",
    "together with these theoretical studies , the observationally determined temperature profile for the disk can be a good probe to see the distortion of the spectral shape due to the disk vertical structure .",
