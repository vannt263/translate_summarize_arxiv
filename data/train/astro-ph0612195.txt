    "a braginskii description is valid for describing processes where the mean free path is a substantial fraction of the size of the system , but does not permit an analysis of processes that occur on lengthscales shorter than the mean free path , e.g. landau damping .",
    "these properties can have profound effects on the resulting plasma dynamics .",
    "a striking example is the magnetothermal instability ( mti ) @xcite .",
    "the magnetothermal instability occurs as a result of heat flow parallel to the magnetic field in a statified atmosphere .",
    "the criterion for convective stability is modified from the well - known schwarzschild criterion @xmath8 , where the entropy , @xmath9 , to the balbus criterion @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the pressure and temperature respectively .",

    "in this situation the mti is able to use the temperature gradient as a source of free energy for the instability .",
    "the growth rate and saturation of this instability in two dimensions has been explored in @xcite , hereafter ps . in ps we demonstrated that computationally measured growth rates match theoretical estimates from a wkb theory for a variety of boundary and initial conditions .",
    "in addition , we showed that mti - unstable plasmas can produce vigorous convective motions and a significant advective heat flux .",
    "the saturated state for an adiabatic atmosphere in 2d was shown to result in an isothermal atmosphere .",
    "we are motivated to study the nonlinear regime of the magnetothermal instability in three dimensions for several reasons .",
    "first , the saturation mechanism in three dimensions may be different from two dimensions .",
    "second , there is a potential for a magnetic dynamo in three dimensions .",
    "finally , the nature of convection is known to be intrinsically different in three dimensions .    in this paper",
    "we present the saturation and heat transport properties of the mti in three dimensions .",
    "we find the instability is capable of generating a magnetic dynamo that greatly amplifies the initial field until it is roughly in equipartition with the fluid turbulent kinetic energy . to estimate the efficiency of heat transport",
    ", we can compare to a fiducial heat flux that would be expected if the conduction were purely isotropic , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the thermal conductivity , @xmath2 is the fixed temperature drop across the simulation domain , and @xmath3 is the temperature gradient scale length .",

    "the understanding of the three dimensional behavior of the mti is likely to be very applicable to several astrophysical systems , such as the intracluster medium of clusters of galaxies , the atmospheres of neutron stars , and radiatively inefficient accretion flows .",

    "any atmosphere where temperature decreases with height is convectively unstable to the mti .      for testing linear growth rates",

    ", we construct an atmosphere similar to  5.2 of ps where an mti - unstable layer is surrounded on top and bottom by convectively stable layers .",
    "this construction prevents the formation of unresolved thermal boundary layers at the edge of the computational domain .",

    "likewise , we can define an alfvn crossing time as @xmath78 for a typical initial magnetic field of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , many orders of magnitude longer than the sound - crossing time .",
    "thus , we see that alfvn waves are ordered out of the problem , as one would expect for a high-@xmath81 plasma .",
    "the third timescale is that of the atmospheric oscillation time .",
    "this time - scale is simply the inverse of the brunt - visl frequency , @xmath82 where @xmath43 is defined in equation ( [ eqn : brunt - vaisala ] ) . for the gradients in region 2 , @xmath83 , which gives @xmath84",
    ". finally , the last timescale of interest is the heat diffusion time across the simulation domain .",
    "it is obtained by non - dimensionalizing the thermal conduction equation , resulting in a time - scale @xmath85 where @xmath2 is the temperature difference across the unstable region , and @xmath86 is the average temperature . for the anisotropic conductivity of @xmath87 and the standard atmosphere , the heat conduction timescale , @xmath88 .",
    "the asymptotic ordering of these terms is instructive : @xmath89 first , the sound crossing time is rapid compared to the buoyancy time .",
    "second , we find that thermal conduction is able to smooth the temperature differences on a timescale comparable to the buoyant time .",
    "finally , as previously noted , the magnetic field is not dynamically important .",
    "we use the 3d version of the athena mhd code @xcite to simulate the mti far into the nonlinear regime .",
    "athena is a higher order , fully unsplit godunov method that combines corner tranport upwind ( ctu ) methods with constrained transport ( ct ) to evolve the equations of mhd while manifestly maintaining the divergence - free constraint of the magnetic field .",
    "we utilize the 6 step ctu+ct algorithm .",
    "isotropic and anisotropic heat fluxes are calculated as face - centered , area - averaged quantities as described in detail in the appendix of ps . by finite - differencing the anisotropic diffusion terms we are able to keep the ratio of parallel conductivity to numerical perpendicular conductivity to better than @xmath90 for an arbitrary field orientation",
    "this level of truncation error is more than sufficient to simulate the mti .",
    "sharma and hammett ( 2006 , personal communication ) have found that for certain discontinous test problems this differencing can lead to negative temperatures ; however , for our applications the temperature gradients are continuous and we observe _ post hoc _ that no such problems arise .",
    "the heat transport algorithm is operator split from the mhd and sub - cycled when the heat conduction timestep is shorter than the mhd courant condition .",
    "both the mhd and heat conduction algorithms are parallelized using mpi .",

    "we have performed some simulations at twice this resolution in each direction .",
    "our box size is small compared to the atmospheric scale height , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the adiabatic sound speed .",
    "since the mti is a local instability , the evolution of modes with wavelengths much smaller than the scale height are independent of the exact form of @xmath97 .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions for the mhd variables and the temperature in the @xmath98 and @xmath99 directions . in the vertical direction ,",
    "we use a modified reflecting boundary condition in which all mhd variables are reflected except the internal energy . due to the non - zero gravitational source term at the boundary",
    ", we extrapolate the pressure across the boundary to ensure the pressure gradient balances gravity , and the boundary cell face does not undergo spurious acceleration .",
    "for the temperature in the @xmath100-direction we implement a dirichlet boundary condition ; that is , the temperature is held fixed at the boundary and heat is permitted to flow as necessary .",
    "we refer to this boundary condition as `` conducting boundaries . ''    to seed multiple modes of the mti , we add small gaussian white noise perturbations in all three velocity components in the unstable region .",
    "the standard perturbation amplitude is @xmath101 , which is highly subsonic .",
    "the standard initial magnetic field strength is @xmath102 .",
    "the alfvn velocity is then roughly @xmath103 ( varying slightly with density ) , which is similar in magnitude to the perturbation velocity , although this fact does not affect the instability , as was shown in ",
    "[ subsec : method : dimensionless ] .",
    "we have tested our 3d numerical algorithms by confirming the linear growth rates of the mti . as expected , we find that the measured growth rates are very close to the ones predicted from the wkb theory , and no deviation is found in the saturation of single - mode perturbations from the two - dimensional results .",
    "we therefore quickly turn our attention to the non - linear regime in 3d .",

    "we realized that the saturation mechanism had two very different forms with a continuum of intermediate cases .",

    "the differences are exposed by examing the evolution of the angle of the magnetic field with the horizontal , shown in figure [ fig : f3-btheta ] ,    and the evolution of the horizontally - averaged , vertical temperature profile , shown in figure [ fig : f3-tavg ] .",
    "it is obvious that the temperature profile evolves quickly to its final value , which deviates only slightly from the initial profile , i.e. approximately @xmath175 of the initial temperature gradient is the asymptotic value .",
    "in contrast , the average angle of the magnetic field evolves quite dramatically to a primarily vertical field with @xmath176 . in this case , which we call case b ,",
    "the mti saturates not by temperature gradient relaxation , but instead by a reorientation of the magnetic field to a primarily vertical field .",
    "we turn our attention to its transport properties .",
    "figure [ fig : f3-heat ] plots the time evolution of    the vertical components of these three heat fluxes and the total heat flux at the midplane , and at 80% of the height of the domain in run f3 . at the midplane ,",
    "the coulombic heat flux is the dominant component of the heat flux with a smaller positive contribution from the advective heat flux .",
    "it is interesting to estimate the efficiency of the mti in transporting heat .",
    "we can calculate the components of the heat flux _ a posteriori _ from our data . using equation [ eqn : f1-anisoq ] to estimate",
    "the heat flux is not appropriate here since @xmath177 for large angles .",
    "the ideal heat flux for comparison purposes is essentially purely isotropic transport across the unstable layer , which is @xmath178 thus , the essentially constant coulombic flux of @xmath179 is almost exactly half of the fiducial heat flux .",
    "this fact leads us to conclude that the mti can be very efficient at heat transport .",
    "one fact that bears further elucidation is the small time - average of the advective component of the heat flux . with the exception of gravity ,",
    "our domain is essentially symmetric from top to bottom .",
    "in addition , the box size is small compared to the scale height , so our simualtions are intrinsically local in nature . in a real plasma of interest , the spitzer conductivity , which varies as @xmath180 ,",
    "would have a substantial variation in thermal conductivity in the vertical direction .",
    "such a conductivity variation , combined with a potential variation in optically - thin cooling and a global temperature profile , could produce a larger net advective flux .",
    "such a realistic configuration will be pursued in future work .",
    "we now discuss one further aspect of run f3 related to the magnetoconvection .",
    "figure [ fig : f3-b2 ] shows a visualization of the magnetic field energy density in the simulation at time , @xmath181 . at this intermediate time , the maximum magnetic energy density exceeds @xmath182 , five orders of magnitude larger than the initial value , for regions colored red in the plot .",
    "in addition , one can see buoyant plumes penetrating into the stable region as a result of convective overshoot .",
    "much magnetic field has now been stored in the stable layers which initially had zero magnetic field ( colored blue in the plot ) .",
    "the phenomena of penetrative convection and overshooting has been thoroughly studied in the magnetoconvection literature of stellar atmospheres @xcite . in comparison to this run ,",
    "case a saturation has far less penetrative convection due to the weaker magnetoconvection ( compare to figure [ fig : f1-b2 ] ) .    finally , we compare run f3 to the other case b runs ( n2 , n3 , and n6 ) .",
    "n2 has the same parameters as f3 , but has a net magnetic flux .",
    "n6 has a fivefold increase in both components of the thermal conductivity and a net flux .",
    "we can compare the fiducial time of @xmath169 , which is not yet fully saturated for either simulation . as we would expect based on our prior discussion , runs n2 and n6",
    "have amplified the magnetic field modestly more in the same amount of time ; however , the temperature gradient saturation is similarly minimal in both cases .",
    "run n3 is a check for convergence having doubled the resolution in each direction . as would be expected for a higher resolution simulation ,",
    "run n3 is approaching saturation more quickly than the lower resolution fiducial case .",
    "the asymptotic behavior though results in very similar magnetic field amplification , levels of turbulence , temperature profile saturation , and most importantly heat flux .",
    "thus , we have a check that our fiducial resolution is sufficient .",
    "having outlined the two different saturated states of the mti , we now contrast the two .",
    "table [ tab : satprop ] lists the saturated values of case a ( run f1 ) and case b ( run f3 ) .",
    "case a , temperature gradient relaxation , is quite similar in nature to the 2d simulation with adiabatic boundary conditions in ps .",
    "a small amount of heat flux is supplied to the unstable layer , leading to the isothermal temperature profile .",
    "in addition , the field remains primarily horizontal with heat flux dominated instantaneously and in the time average by thermal conduction .",
    "the convection is highly subsonic and little magnetic flux pumping is observed .",
    "the net heat flux is roughly one - half of the fiducial value in the saturated state .",
    "case b , on the other hand , has a large heat flux supplied to the unstable layer , which causes the mti to saturate by re - orienting the field lines in a largely vertical direction . the level of convection , while still subsonic , is far more vigorous than case a. the advective heat flux is consistently positive ; however , the total heat flux is still dominated by the coulombic component .",
    "the convective plumes are able to traverse the unstable layer in approximately 700 sound crossing times , thus leading to a significant amount of convective overshoot and magnetic energy storage in the stable layers .",
    "the net heat flux is roughly one  half of the fiducial value .    in both cases , the magnetic energy density increases through dynamo action until it is roughly in equipartition with the kinetic energy density of the subsonic convection .",
    "it should be noted that the plasma energy density is still dominated by the thermal component . in both cases ,",
    "the effective thermal conductivity , as measured by the ratio of the actual heat flux to the fiducial heat flux , is quite high .",
    "intermediate to the two cases previously discussed lies run f2 where the thermal conductivity in the middle and outer layers is constant , @xmath183 .",
    "figure [ fig : f2-time ] shows the time evolution of the volume  averaged components of the magnetic energy density and kinetic energy density over the entire domain , including the stable regions .",
    "appreciable amplification of the magnetic energy density is seen , especially in the @xmath100-component .",
    "the kinetic energy , after an initial transient , settles down to stable constant turbulence with an rms mach number of @xmath126 averaged over region 2 .",
    "the ( essentially ) saturated alfvn velocity is @xmath127 , thus bringing the magnetic energy density into quasi - equipartition with the kinetic energy density .",
    "the angle of the magnetic field with respect to the horizontal saturates at an angle of approximately @xmath184 .",
    "the heat fluxes for this run are shown in figure [ fig : f2-heat ] . the saturated coulombic heat flux in both layers is found to be approximately @xmath185 , slightly less than one - third of the maximum possible value  still consistent with a relatively efficient transport of heat .",
    "the advective heat fluxes , while initially zero , are asymptotically oscillating around zero .",
    "since we define the fiducial heat flux with respect to the minimum thermal conductivity in the problem ( imagine a series of thermal resistors ) , the intermediate case appears to be less efficient than the other two cases . in run f1 ,",
    "the minimum conductivity is in the isotropic stable layer , thus causing @xmath186 to be an order of magnitude smaller for it .",
    "if we were to instead calculate the fiducial heat flux with only the thermal conductivity of the anisotropic layer , the intermediate case would indeed have a thermal efficiency intermediate to runs f1 and f3 .",
    "having outlined three different cases of saturation , we now show that there is a coherent and logical ordering of saturation parameters among them . as we progress from case a to case b ,",
    "the free parameter we increase is the ratio of isotropic conduction in the outer layers to the anisotropic conduction in the unstable region , @xmath187 .",
    "this variation is tantamount to increasing the applied heat flux to the mti - unstable layer .",
    "the resultant saturation properties are evident by simply scanning table [ tab : satprop ] .",
    "firstly , the vigor of the resultant magnetoconvective dynamo , as characterized by amplification of the magnetic field ( @xmath188 and @xmath189 ) , the rms mach number , and the alfvn velocity , increases significantly as we progress from case a to case b. secondly , the resultant atmospheric state changes smoothly in this progression as evidenced by the increase in the average magnetic field angle .",
    "the degree of relaxation of the temperature gradient , as shown in figure [ fig : tcomp ] , decreases substantially from case a to case b. yet , the net heat flux , which is a convolution of these two properties , monotonically increases from case a to case b. all three cases exhibit quite efficient transport of heat flux compared to the fiducial value .",
    "the most promising potential application of the mti is to the intracluster medium of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the plasma has a typical density of @xmath190@xmath191 and a temperature of roughly @xmath192 kev , leading to copious x  ray emission measured by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. the total cluster luminosities are found to be typically @xmath193 erg / s to @xmath194 erg / s in the x  ray .",
    "most of these clusters appear to be in hydrodynamic equilibrium , as the time since the last major merger is approximately 5 gyr @xcite , although a few exceptional examples have relatively disturbed shapes due to recent major mergers , such as perseus @xcite , abell 3667 @xcite , and abell 2142 @xcite .",
    "estimates for magnetic field strength in clusters range from 1  10 @xmath195 g at the center and 0.1  0.7 @xmath195 g at a radius of 1 mpc @xcite , values which are typically not dynamically important .    to understand the potential for the mti , begin by considering the spitzer conductivity for a cluster plasma , @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the electron density and @xmath198 is the coulomb logarithm @xcite . since @xmath199",
    ", the perpendicular electron conductivity may be safely ignored , for a 1 @xmath195 g field , @xmath200 .",
    "the gravitational potential of the cluster is well - approximated by an nfw profile for the dark matter @xcite .",
    "now we can consider the instability criterion for the mti , equation [ eqn : mti_instability_criterion1 ] , for a typical cluster with mass @xmath201 @xmath202 , an nfw scale radius of 500 kpc , and a typical density of @xmath203 .",
    "the first term of the instability criterion is a measure of magnetic tension at a given scale and field strength . for our model cluster ,",
    "the plasma beta is @xmath204 , thus , the magnetic field is dynamically weak .",
    "the second term is set by the product of the cluster gravitational cluster potential ( @xmath205 ) and the logarithmic derivative of the temperature .",
    "we calculate a reasonable temperature profile by using a fit to cluster structure formation calculations given by @xcite .",
    "finally , we assume that outside of the cluster core , conduction is entirely dominated by parallel conduction , thus @xmath206 .",
    "balancing these two terms gives the smallest wavelength , @xmath207 , at which the icm is marginally unstable to the mti .",
    "this lengthscale can be parameterized as @xmath208 thus all scales larger than 4.6 kpc are unstable to the mti . an alternative way of looking at this problem is to estimate what field strength would be required for the largest scale , i.e. the cluster virial radius , to be stable to the mti . for our model cluster",
    "this requires @xmath209 , which corresponds to magnetic field strengths in excess of 110 @xmath195 g .",
    "typical measurements of cluster field strengths by the various mechanism of synchrotron emission , faraday rotation , or inverse compton emission never approach this large value @xcite .",
    "in addition , we can comment on the temperature profiles of clusters .",
    "the previously mentioned structure formation calculations assume a @xmath210cdm cosmology and predict a moderately steep , monotonically decreasing temperature profile of the intracluster plasma @xcite .",
    "recent observations with _ xmm - newton _ have inferred a temperature profile that is flatter than the predictions from structure formation @xcite .",
    "it may be that the observed temperature profiles are indicative of the saturated state of the mti .",
    "the mti also provides for a dynamo mechanism to amplify a small seed magnetic field through magnetoconvection .",
    "a number of authors have considered the effect of thermal conduction on the temperature profile of clusters of galaxies using an effective conductivity across tangled field lines in a turbulent medium @xcite .",
    "more recent efforts have revised this calculation to include a spectrum of correlation lengths , resulting in an effective conductivity that is much closer to the value of the full spitzer conductivity @xcite . in this case the turbulence which tangles field lines is externally driven . however ,",
    "the icm is unstable to the mti , and therefore the turbulence , the tangling of the field lines , and the resulting heat flux are determined by the same underlying driving mechanism .",
    "computing the temperature profile and saturated heat flux self - consistently in a typical icm is an important goal of future efforts .",
    "@xcite has constructed an analytical model that includes the effects of anisotropic cosmic ray pressure in addition to the thermal conduction in the mti model .",
    "it is worth noting that non - thermal particles may also contribute to the structure and dynamics of the icm .",
    "in addition , @xcite have proposed that a cosmic ray version of the mti could be at play in the core of the cluster , where a radial gradient of cosmic ray pressure ( from an agn for example ) can play the role the temperature gradient does in the mti .",
    "this heat transport in the core is a potential mechanism to obviate the need for cooling flows .",
    "two other potential applications of the magnetothermal instability have also been identified .",
    "first , neutron star atmospheres have large temperature and pressure gradients due to a surface gravity of @xmath211 , giving a scale height of around 10 cm .",
    "the temperature gradient must be large to drive the mti in the presence of large magnetic fields .",
    "for example , millisecond radio pulsars typically have magnetic fields in the @xmath212 ",
    "@xmath213 g range @xcite . in a region near the equator and inside of the photosphere",
    ", there is the potential for the mti to be unstable . here",
    "the primary limiting factor is the term @xmath214 from the instability criterion .",
    "the atmosphere is a semi - degenerate , semi - relativistic plasma .",
    "deep in the atmosphere , the larmor radius becomes comparable to the mean free path . near the surface of the atmosphere ,",
    "radiative transport primarily due to brehmsstrahlung becomes important .",
    "both of these properties suppress the mti due to isotropic transport . between these two regions ,",
    "though , the neutron star atmosphere may be mti - unstable . due to the complex nature of the physics",
    ", this supposition will require detailed modeling of the neutron star atmosphere to assess with certainty .",
    "a second potential application is to radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) .",
    "observations of the electron mean free path in sgr a@xmath215 in our galactic center show that @xmath216 ",
    "@xmath217 schwarschild radii .",
    "thus , the plasma is strongly collisionless .",
    "recent analytical work by @xcite shows that including electron thermal conduction can suppress the accretion rate by 1  3 orders of magnitude from the bondi rate  a first step in explaining the very low luminosity of sgr a@xmath215 .",
    "this analysis is static , however , and can not fully account for the resultant buoyant motion driven by the thermal conduction . @xcite",
    "have developed landau fluid closures that describe kinetic mhd appropriate to this regime .",
    "fully collisionless shearing box simulations performed by @xcite actually lead to a modestly increased @xmath218-parameter compared to typical mri turbulence in an mhd simulation .",
    "this increase in @xmath218 is due to anisotropic pressure effects in the fully collisionless treatment .",
    "such an increase is consistent with the magnetoviscous instability in the shearing box @xcite ; however , it can not account for observations of much lower accretion rates for sgr .",
    "a@xmath215 . as a result ,",
    "global simulations of collisionless accretion are called for that include the temperature stratification of the flow .",
    "many astrophysical plasmas fall into a low density , weakly magnetized regime , in which transport of heat and momentum due to thermal conduction and viscosity takes place primarily along magnetic field lines .",
    "one would expect an atmosphere with @xmath219 to be completely stable to convection .",
    "yet , the magnetothermal instability destabilizes this atmosphere if @xmath220 .",
    "we have performed fully three - dimensional time - dependent mhd simulations of the nonlinear regime of this instability .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of the mti in 3d with different parameters shows several common features .",
    "exponential growth in the linear growth rate produces a spike in all the components of the kinetic and magnetic energy densities , and a rapid rearrangement of the temperature profile to the final saturated temperature gradient . after this initial transient",
    ", the atmosphere enters a magnetoconvective phase in which the fluid motions reach a steady level of subsonic turbulence .",
    "simultaneously , the magnetic field is amplified in a dynamo until the magnetic energy density is in approximate equipartition with the kinetic energy density .    as was outlined in  [ sec : saturation ] , we have identified two different saturated states for the mti in 3d .",
    "these mechanisms differ proximately in the strength of the isotropic thermal conduction in the stable layers relative to the strength of the anisotropic thermal conduction in the mti - unstable region .",
    "this adjustable parameter allows an exploration of the parameter space for a range of driven heat flux boundary conditions . in case",
    "a : temperature gradient relaxation , the isotropic heat flux is small and the unstable layer saturates in a way reminiscent of adiabatic simulations from 2d . in the saturated state ,",
    "the temperature profile is almost isothermal and the magnetic field is still primarily horizontal in orientation . in case b ,",
    "the isotropic heat flux is large and the unstable layer saturates in a significantly different way .",
    "the temperature gradient relaxes only slightly ; however , the magnetic field rearranges itself into a primarily vertical configuration to carry the applied heat load .",
    "this variation of the isotropic heat flux changes the vigor of the magnetoconvection , resulting in higher rms mach numbers and higher magnetic field amplification as we approach case b. in all cases , though , we find the instability reaches a natural quasi - equipartition between subsonic turbulent motions and magnetic energy density .",
    "a key conclusion from this work is that the magnetic field can no longer be thought of a passive contaminant .",
    "we began with an atmosphere that was convectively stable to the schwarschild criterion with a weak magnetic field .",
    "we can quantify `` weak '' in terms of the plasma beta , @xmath221 , the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure .",
    "for our initial choice of magnetic field in the simulations , @xmath222 .",
    "thus , conventional wisdom leads to considering the magnetic field as dynamically irrelevant  a passive contaminant simply frozen into the background fluid and transported by purely hydrodynamic motions . yet",
    ", the illustrative example of case b shows that this reasoning is patently incorrect in many astrophysical plasmas .",
    "the transport of heat along the magnetic field triggers the magnetothermal instability which is capable of reordering and amplifying the magnetic field , generating magnetoconvection , and transporting heat .",
    "the dynamically weak magnetic field now completely dominates the resulting dynamics .",
    "the most immediate application for future study is to the intracluster medium of clusters of galaxies .",
    "a fully three - dimensional mhd simualtion including realistic spitzer thermal conductivity and radiative cooling is required .",
    "in addition , the effects of conduction on radiatively inefficient accretion flows and convection dominated accretion flows must be investigated in the context of mri turbulence in global mhd simulations .",
