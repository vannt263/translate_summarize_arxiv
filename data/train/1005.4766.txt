    "[ fig2](b ) indicates that vrh is the dominant mechanism of conduction in zn@xmath33co@xmath34o below 100  k. we find similar behavior for both undoped zno and zn@xmath35co@xmath36o crystals .",
    "the results of fitting the data for all three samples with the vrh model ( eqs .",

    "note that both of these conditions are satisfied in the zn@xmath0co@xmath15o crystals .",
    "for the zno crystals the conditions are only satisifed above approximately 25  k , and at lower temperatures other conduction mechanisms may compete with vrh .",
    "the values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath37 determined by fitting to the vrh model are reasonable compared with results which exist for both doped and undoped zno .",
    "@xcite thus , the analysis of the temperature dependent electronic transport data for both the zno and zn@xmath0co@xmath15o crystals provides convincing evidence for the vrh conduction process up to approximately 100  k , above which a thermally activated conduction mechanism becomes more appropriate .",
    "measurements were also carried out to study the magnetoresistive behavior of the single crystals up to a magnetic field @xmath43 of 4.5  t and at temperatures down to 2.5  k. figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and  [ fig3](d ) show that for the zn@xmath0co@xmath15o crystals the magnetoresistance ( mr ) is weak and negative ( see inset fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) down to a certain temperature .",
    "below that temperature the mr becomes positive ( i.e. changes its sign ) and becomes larger in magnitude .",
    "the crossover in mr from negative to positive occurs at @xmath1020  k in the doped crystals .",
    "it may be noted that the mr increases with the decrease in temperature in all cases , and also with increase in the concentration of cobalt .",
    "the largest value attained , near saturation of the positive mr , is 20  % ( fig .  [ fig3](d ) ) at 2.5  k for zn@xmath33co@xmath34o single crystals , which is at the upper end of mr values reported by other groups for zno - based dms  @xcite .",
    "a positive mr also arises in pristine zno crystals below 5  k ( not shown ) , but it is weaker than in the cobalt doped crystals , no more than 1% at 2.5  k , which is likely due to residual impurities .",
    "there are several mechanisms which are typically cited to account for the mr in dms at low temperatures :    * a negative mr at low fields owing to the magnetic field breaking the time - reversal symmetry of scattering paths involved in weak localization ; * a negative mr at large fields from a reduced scattering of the carriers as the magnetic field aligns the moments of the magnetic dopants ; * a positive mr at intermediate fields from a field - induced spin - splitting of the conduction band due to the s - d exchange interaction .",
    "the absence of evidence for the first type , i.e. a sharp negative mr at @xmath440.1  t , as seen in a number of works  @xcite , is consistent with the temperature dependent resistance measurements of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which indicate a hopping type conduction at low temperatures rather than weak localization of the carriers .",
    "the second type of mr is seen in thin films of zno - based dms that exhibit ferromagnetism in magnetic measurements , and the absence of this component at the magnetic fields applied is consistent with the paramagnetic character of the single crystals as measured by squid magnetometry ( discussed below ) .",
    "a phenomenological model for the third mechanism of mr has been developed by khosla and fischer  @xcite , where the positive mr is proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "this model has been used elsewhere to explain the mr behavior of doped zno thin films  @xcite .",
    "the predicted @xmath45 dependence appears to account for the data of figs .",
    "[ fig3](b ) and  [ fig3](e ) .",
    "however , the khosla - fischer model considers the mr to arise from a field - induced splitting of bands of extended states . in the zn@xmath0co@xmath15o crystals of the present report , conduction is via localized states rather than through bands of extended states .",
    "hence , none of the mechanisms of mr commonly applied to dms are applicable in our case , and we must consider an alternate mechanism to explain the low temperature positive mr , based on the vrh conduction process .    at low temperatures , where hopping distances are large enough , a positive",
    "mr arises due to the shrinking of the wavefunctions of the states available for an electron hop .",
    "@xcite in low magnetic fields , the positive mr can then be described with    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the carrier localization length and @xmath26 is the vrh exponent of eq .",
    "[ mottvrh ] .",
    "this may account for the @xmath45 dependence at low fields as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](b ) and  [ fig3](e ) . at higher fields ,",
    "there is a change to an approximate @xmath48 behavior , as seen before in thin films of cobalt doped zno in the low temperature hard gap regime of electronic transport  @xcite .",
    "note that at the lowest temperatures and highest fields , especially for the higher co concentration crystals , the mr is more weakly field dependent than in the low field region .",
    "the data of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] show that , at 2.5  k in fields of @xmath491.5  t , the mr of the zn@xmath50co@xmath51o crystals can be approximately described by @xmath52@xmath53 , which is very close to the expected high - field mr in the vrh model of @xmath52@xmath54  @xcite .",
    "we thus find that the mr properties of the zn@xmath0co@xmath15o crystals are completely explained as the effect of the magnetic field on the vrh conduction process .",
    "the results of magnetic measurements on each crystal type are shown in fig .",
    "the magnetization vs field ( @xmath55-@xmath56 ) measurements were carried out at room temperature as well as at 2.5  k. the @xmath55-@xmath56 curves of fig .  [",
    "fig5](a ) for cobalt doped samples at 2.5  k , normalized to their respective values at 4.5  t for each sample , exhibit neither remanence nor coercivity .",
    "the maximum values of magnetization of the zn@xmath35co@xmath36o and zn@xmath33co@xmath34o crystals in 4.5  t applied field are 2.01 and 2.34  emu / g respectively , corresponding to absolute magnetic moment values of 5@xmath57 - 1@xmath57 emu .",
    "in addition , the curves do not saturate , even at the highest applied field .",
    "a representative sample of the temperature dependent magnetization ( @xmath55-@xmath58 ) measurements for the crystals , measured under both zero - field cooled ( @xmath59 ) and field - cooled ( @xmath60 ) conditions , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) . a ferromagnetic material , besides exhibiting distinct hysteresis in an @xmath55-@xmath56 loop , also demonstrates thermomagnetic irreversibility ( tmi ) , i.e. , @xmath61@xmath59 in @xmath55-@xmath58 curves .",
    "the @xmath62 and @xmath63 curves of fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) are identical , showing no sign of tmi , further confirming the lack of ferromagnetic ordering in the sample ; instead the observed behavior is consistent with paramagnetism .",
    "it is thus evident that the zn@xmath0co@xmath15o single crystals are paramagnetic , and doping of co does not result in any ferromagnetism .",
    "to confirm that the magnetic behavior observed is due to the cobalt doping , the @xmath55-@xmath56 curves of the pristine zno sample recorded at both 2.5  k and room temperature ( 300  k ) are drawn in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) .",
    "it may be noted that the data recorded at room temperature exhibit a linear variation of magnetization @xmath55 with applied field , with a negative slope . this is a signature of a diamagnetic material .",
    "however , at 2.5  k pristine zno crystals reveal a feeble paramagnetism with a magnetization 100@xmath64 weaker than that of the zn@xmath0co@xmath15o .",
    "this weak low - temperature paramagnetism is possibly due to the presence of residual impurities as detected in the mr measurements .    in paramagnets ,",
    "a value of the effective magnetic moment per ion , @xmath65 , can be estimated from the slope ( @xmath66 ) of a @xmath67 vs @xmath58 plot ( curie law fit ) , where @xmath68 is the number of moles of co. the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) shows that the curie law applies over the full range of temperatures measured .",
    "the value of @xmath65 was found to be 3.29  @xmath69 for zn@xmath35co@xmath36o , which compares favorably to values determined for other paramagnetic zno : co samples  @xcite and is close to the theoretical free co@xmath4 ion spin - only value of 3.87  @xmath69 .",
    "however , at the higher co concentration of @xmath2 , @xmath65 has a lower value of 2.16  @xmath69 . as the co concentration increases ,",
    "the average co - co distance is reduced , which strengthens the direct antiferromagnetic exchange between co neighbors or superexchange via co - o - co bonds , and consequently the average moment per co is reduced from the case of isolated non - interacting co@xmath4 ions .",
    "theoretically , the value of the total moment of paramagnetic co@xmath4 ions is @xmath70(=@xmath71+@xmath72)=3 + 3/2=9/2 .",
    "however , for transition metals in semiconductors such as zno it is often found that the orbital angular momentum of the unpaired 3@xmath73 electrons is quenched , i.e. @xmath71=0 , and hence the total moment comes only from the spin momentum @xmath72=3/2 .",
    "a brillouin function for the field dependence of the moment of isolated , non - interacting paramagnetic co@xmath4 ions with a spin - only moment of 3/2 is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig5](a ) alongside the magnetic moment data measured at 2.5  k. the calculated field dependence for @xmath72=3/2 paramagnetic ions is extremely close to the experimental data from the cobalt doped samples , confirming that the field dependent magnetization is from a majority of co ions in a divalent , paramagnetic state .",
    "the antiferromagnetically correlated fraction of co ions in the crystals is insensitive to the magnetic field .",
    "finally , we summarize the state of the incorporated co ions in the single crystals of zno , and their effect on the magnetic and magnetotransport properties .",
    "the resistivity and mr measurements point to the presence of localized electronic states , whereas the magnetic properties result from isolated co@xmath4 ions in the crystals . at higher co concentrations ,",
    "a proportion of the co ions experience some antiferromagnetic exchange , likely with near neighboring co ions , which reduces the measured effective moment per incorporated ion . at low temperatures ,",
    "charge carriers hop between the localized electronic states , and in the presence of a magnetic field the probability of hopping is reduced as the wavefunctions of the localized states shrink .",
    "however , at higher magnetic fields , the paramagnetic co ions progressively align with the field , and a spin dependent vrh conduction process may be expected to lower the resistivity at sufficiently high fields  @xcite .",
    "no such negative mr is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , even at the lowest temperature and maximum field , where the @xmath55-@xmath56 data of fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) show that magnetic alignment of the co ions is significant .",
    "furthermore , the mr is evidently decoupled from the magnetization of the crystals , as demonstrated by the different shapes of the mr in the two crystals as compared to the identical shape of their @xmath55-@xmath56 curves .",
    "this independence of the magnetotransport from the magnetization in the zn@xmath0co@xmath15o crystals implies that the localized states involved in the conduction process may not be spin polarized through alignment of the co ion magnetic moments .    although the formation of localized electronic states owing to the incorporation of co in zno is not controversial , our results support the idea that the electronic transport properties in this dms may be only weakly related to the magnetic properties .",
    "some results on magnetic tunnel junctions fabricated from ferromagnetic cobalt doped zno have non - saturating positive magnetoresistance at low temperatures  @xcite , rather than negative magnetoresistance as would be expected from tunneling of spin - polarized charge carriers between layers with their magnetic moments aligned in high fields .",
    "additionally , those authors acknowledged that the behavior of the tunneling magnetoresistance does not correlate with the magnetization of these devices .",
    "these results point to the possibility that the existence of ferromagnetism in cobalt doped zno is not a sufficient condition for generation of spin - polarized charge carriers .",
    "pristine and cobalt doped zno single crystals were grown by a molten salt solvent technique at low temperatures ( 480  @xmath74c ) . the zn@xmath0co@xmath15o crystals are paramagnetic ; there is no sign of ferromagnetism at up to @xmath2 .",
    "the paramagnetic properties of the crystals arise from isolated co@xmath4 ions . at temperatures above 100  k , conduction in the crystals",
    "is by thermal activation , with a change to mott variable range hopping at lower temperatures .",
    "doped and undoped zno crystals show almost negligible negative mr at room temperature , with a crossover to positive mr below 20  k. the positive mr reaches values as large as 20% in the zn@xmath0co@xmath15o crystals at 2.5  k , and is consistent with a field - induced shrinking of the localized state wavefunctions , which reduces the probability of a hop .",
    "the magnetotransport is decoupled from the magnetization , and no spin dependent transport is observed at the highest level of magnetic alignment of the co@xmath4 ions .",
    "our results indicate that the co incorporated in low temperature grown single crystals simultaneously introduces paramagnetic moments and localized electronic states into the zno electronic structure , however the bulk magnetic and magnetotransport properties are independent of each other",
