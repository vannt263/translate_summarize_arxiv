    "since the success of production of the strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite , relativistic viscous hydrodynamic model has been one of promising phenomenological models .",
    "now at rhic as well as at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) high - energy heavy - ion collisions are carried out .",
    "the strong collective dynamics observed in experimental data at rhic and the lhc provides us with a clue of understanding the qcd matter .",
    "a relativistic hydrodynamic model is suitable for description of space - time evolution of strongly interacting qcd matter produced after collisions .",
    "besides , it has a close relation to an equation of state and transport coefficients of the qgp .",
    "the qcd phase transition mechanism and the qgp bulk property is elucidated from comparison between hydrodynamic calculation and experimental data .",
    "a relativistic viscous hydrodynamic model plays an important role in the quantitative understanding of the qgp bulk property .",
    "however , introducing viscosity effect into the framework of relativistic hydrodynamics is not an easy task , because of the acausality problem .",
    "there is not the unique way to extract the second - order relativistic viscous hydrodynamic equation . in high - energy heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "currently the israel - stewart theory @xcite and conformal hydrodynamics @xcite are often used . solving them numerically , study of experimental data of high - energy heavy - ion collisions is performed @xcite .",
    "now the relativistic viscous hydrodynamic model can explain not only the elliptic flow but also higher harmonics @xcite . in particular ,",
    "analyses of the higher harmonics bring us progress of understanding of the qgp , because it is more sensitive to the qgp bulk property .",
    "furthermore , a lot of experimental data are reported ; correlation between flow harmonics @xcite , event plane correlation @xcite , non - linearity of higher flow harmonics @xcite and three particle correlation @xcite . at the same time",
    ", we can investigate the qgp property further using information of ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional space - time evolutions @xcite .",
    "the rich experimental data realizes investigation of both of shear and bulk viscosities and even temperature dependence of them .",
    "we need to perform numerical calculations for relativistic viscous hydrodynamics with high accuracy , to achieve the quantitative analyses of the transport coefficients of the qgp from comparison with high statistics and high precision experimental data .",
    "for example , the following features in numerical calculations are demanded : a fluctuating initial condition is correctly captured and numerical viscosity which is needed for stability of calculation is much smaller than physical viscosity .",
    "furthermore , time evolution of the viscous stress tensor is sensitive to numerical scheme , because it consists of time and space derivatives of hydrodynamic variables .    here",
    "we present a new relativistic viscous hydrodynamics code optimized in the milne coordinates .",
    "the code is developed based on our algorithm of the ideal fluid in which a riemann solver with the two shock approximation @xcite is employed @xcite .",
    "it is stable even with small numerical viscosity @xcite",
    ". we shall show comparison between numerical calculations and analytic solutions of viscous bjorken s flow and the israel - stewart theory in gubser flow regime .    using the code ,",
    "we shall discuss possible development of kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "hydrodynamic instability and turbulent flow are discussed in ref . @xcite and",
    "the possibility of kh instability is argued in ref.@xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic instability is affected by viscosity effect , which suggests that the numerical code with less numerical viscosity is indispensable for study on it .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : hydro ] by showing the relativistic viscous hydrodynamic equations briefly . in section [ sec : algorithm ] we explain the numerical algorithm ; strang splitting method and numerical implementation .",

    "for example , one can assign the @xmath7 as net charge flow ( eckart frame @xcite ) or as energy flow ( landau frame @xcite ) .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in viscous fluid depends on the choice of @xmath7 .",
    "here we choose the landau frame for relativistic viscous hydrodynamic equations , because we focus on the high - energy heavy - ion collisions as rhic and the lhc where the net baryon number is very small @xcite .    in the landau frame",

    "the problem can be resolved by introducing the second - order terms of the viscous tensor and the derivative of fluid variables into the hydrodynamic equations @xcite .",

    "the extension of the israel - stewart theory is also proposed @xcite .",
    "in addition to the framework of the israel - stewart theory , other approaches such as ads / cft correspondence @xcite and renormalization group method are applied to construct causal relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .    in the second - order viscous hydrodynamics , additional equations for evolution of the viscous tensors",
    "are needed . here",
    ", we introduce the convective time derivative @xmath16 and the spatial gradient operator @xmath17 which are defined by @xmath18 respectively .",
    "for example , in the second - order israel - stewart formalism the constitutive equations of the viscous tensors are given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are relaxation times , @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent second - order terms .",

    "in this section , we present our numerical algorithm for solving the relativistic viscous hydrodynamic equations in the milne coordinates .      in our algorithm , we split the conservation equations eqs . and into two parts , an ideal part and a viscous part using the strang splitting method @xcite . specifically , the net charge current and the energy - momentum tensor are divided as follows ; @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "if the relaxation times @xmath66 , and @xmath21 are much shorter than the fluid timescale @xmath67 , the time - step size @xmath68 should be smaller than the relaxation timescale , which makes the computational cost increase . to avoid this problem",

    "the larger the difference of velocity in the shear flow is , the faster the growth of instability is .",
    "that is why the development of vortex at @xmath188 is faster than that at @xmath189 .",
    "the fluctuation with a longer wave length grows slower in the kh instability than that with a shorter wave length does .",

    "a fluctuation with long wave length disappears due to the bjorken s flow and a fluctuation with short wave length is smeared by the viscosity .",
    "however , because at forward rapidity a fluctuation with long wave length grows faster , there may be a chance that the kh instability occurs . or if the longitudinal flow is smaller than bjorken s flow , a fluctuation with long wave length survives and can form a vortex . the existence of the kh instability depends on the viscosity and the flow distribution",

    "after the brief explanation of the relativistic viscous hydrodynamic equations , we showed the numerical algorithm of the code which has the ideal part and the viscous part .",
    "for the ideal part we employed the riemann solver with the two shock approximation which achieves stable calculation even with the small numerical viscosity @xcite and for the viscous part we utilized the pes method @xcite . because we found that the order of accurate in space in the convection part of the viscous part is important , we applied the ppm instead of the mc limiter to the convection part .",
    "next we examined the validity of our code using two test calculations ; the viscous bjorken flow for the one dimensional test and the israel - stewart theory in the gubser flow regime for the three dimensional test . in both of tests , our numerical calculations showed good agreements with analytical solutions . besides , we pointed out that in the gubser flow the shear tensors are sensitive to numerical scheme .",

    "we focused on the mid rapidity and started the numerical calculations with the simple initial conditions inspired by the color - flux tube structure of hot spots in fluctuating initial conditions . in the case of the ideal",
    "fluid we found the vortex formation after @xmath195 fm , however we did not observe the vortex formation in the viscous fluid even with very small viscosity . to obtain a more conclusive result for the vortex formation in high - energy heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "we need to use the more realistic initial conditions .",
    "for example , existence of the shear flow is found in the initial condition based on the color glass condensate @xcite .",
    "in addition , effect of deviation from the bjorken s flow in a realistic initial condition is also important",
    ". furthermore we shall apply our new code to analyses of experimental data at rhic and the lhc ; correlation between flow harmonics @xcite , event plane correlation @xcite , non - linearity of higher flow harmonics @xcite and three particle correlation @xcite .",
    "comprehensive investigation of experimental data with the accurate numerical method of the relativistic viscous hydrodynamics gives us deep insight of the qcd matter .",
    "we would like to thank berndt mueller and rainer fries for valuable discussions .",
    "c.n . is grateful for the hospitality of the members of cyclotron institute and department of physics and astronomy in texas a&m .",
    "the work of c.n . is supported by the jsps grant - in - aid for scientific research ( s ) no .",
    "26220707 and us department of energy grant de - fg02 - 05er41367 .",
    "we discuss the numerical scheme dependence on the shear tensors in solving the convection term in eq .. we compare the three numerical schemes ; a dimensional splitting method with the mc limiter , a dimensional splitting method with the ppm and the ctu method @xcite with the mc limiter for three - dimensional unsplit method .    figure [ fig : gubser - comp ] shows the semi - analytic solutions and numerical results of the shear tensors @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath196 and @xmath142 at @xmath197 fm . in @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath196 , results of all numerical schemes are reasonably consistent with the semi - analytic solutions . in addition , differences among them are small .",
    "however , in @xmath142 we can clearly see the scheme difference . in the solution obtained with the mc limiter , the large deviation from the semi - analytic solution at the peak around @xmath198 fm appears , where s the ppm and the ctu methods keep the good agreement with the semi - analytic solution .",
    "the ctu method can achieve the high numerical accuracy with the second - order accurate in space , but it needs the more computer memory than the dimensional splitting method with the ppm does .",
    "therefore we employ the dimensional splitting method with the ppm for solving the convection term .                    99 t.d .",
