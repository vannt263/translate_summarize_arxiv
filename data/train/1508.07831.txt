    "we consider a body moving at a constant velocity in in a homogeneous fluid at rest , under the action of a constant force @xmath0 , the gas is initially at thermal equilibrium and it interacts through elastic collisions with the body .",
    "the aim is to show the effect of the body s shape to the friction acting on it , giving an exact estimate of it .    in @xcite a model of free gas of light particles",
    "elastically interacting with a simple shaped body ( a stick in two dimensions or a disk in three dimensions ) is studied and it is proven that the system possesses a stationary velocity @xmath2 which is also the limiting velocity and that the asymptotic time behavior in approaching this @xmath2 is power - law .",
    "more precisely , assuming the initial velocity @xmath3 such that @xmath4 is positive and small , it was proven that : @xmath5 , 2 , 3 is the dimension of the physical space and @xmath6 is a constant , depending on the medium and on the shape of the obstacle .",
    "this result , surprising for not being exponential , is due to re - collisions that can occur between gas particles and the body while it is accelerating .    similar model ( @xcite ) have been studied where a stochastic kind of interaction between the gas and the body is assumed : when a particle of the medium hits the body it is absorbed and immediately stochastically re - emitted with a maxwellian distribution centered around the body velocity , in this case the behaviour was found to be @xmath7    in @xcite and @xcite these models have been numerically studied , in particular they computed the dynamic with stochastic interaction carried out in @xcite for a disk subjected to an harmonic force confirming the analytical results ( for analytical studies see @xcite and references quoted therein ) , here they removed the hypothesis of initial velocity close to @xmath2 , showing that this does nt affect the dynamic .",
    "the question of whether the trend of the solution was connected with the simple shape chosen for the object in the above mentioned articles was firstly faced in @xcite , in the domain of elastic collisions , where it was studied the evolution of a general convex body , and it was confirmed the same power decay expressed in ( [ intro trend d+2 ] ) ; this was mainly due to an important feature that the convex body shares with the first case of a simple disk , namely in both cases colliding gas particles bounce away from the body .    in @xcite the hypothesis of convexity",
    "was then removed and it was studied the case of a body with lateral barriers of finite length parallel to the axis of motion ( a box - like object in two dimensions ) , it was shown that this simple kind of concavity significantly altered the asymptotic of the system ; it was the first case in which there was a change in the power of decay : @xmath8 and no change from two to three dimensions .",
    "the case of more general shape of the body was left out for further difficulties , we believe indeed that there are actually non trivial issues to be faced for these more general cases .    to show this and in the in the spirit of getting a more realistic perspective in the study of friction problems , in this paper we studied the friction term itself acting on a body fixed at constant velocities but with a more general kind of concavity , for example the friction exerted by the air on a vehicle moving at constant velocity , ( as a practical image one can think to the air on the windshield of a car moving at constant speed ) we show atypical features , namely the presence of a time dependent friction for constant velocities .    in all previous cases in fact the object ( the disk , the convex body or the box ) fixed at any constant velocity experienced a constant friction .",
    "the reason being that a gas particle that hits a disk or a convex body moving at a fixed velocity can not undergo a second collision with it , thus canceling the effect of recollisions and possible time dependencies in the friction , as far as the box shaped object in @xcite , although recolisions can occur even when it is fixed at constant velocity , they will necessarily occur with the lateral barriers of the body which are parallel to the axis of motion , therefore the momentum transferred along the motion direction is zero , thus canceling again recollisions contributions .",
    "this is not true anymore if we consider the case of the present paper were a slightly more general kind of concavity is considered , namely a body with tilted lateral barriers ( see section [ section our problem ] ) , these trap particles which , bouncing inside , correlate through times different areas of the inner side of the body .",
    "the time dependence in the friction term is vanishing and we give an exact estimate of it .",
    "+ we then employ this result to prove that in the actual dynamic of the body ( that is a body which is not fixed in velocity ) there ca nt be a stationary velocity .",
    "the gas is assumed to be made of free particles ( see @xcite on knudsen gas ) elastically interacting with the body and it is studied in the mean field approximation .",
    "we consider for sake of simplicity the two dimensional case . in particular",
    "we consider a symmetric angle - shaped body moving towards the @xmath1 direction in a vlasov gas , the body is constrained to stay with its base orthogonal to the x axis , with the center moving along the same axis and with the hollow base facing forwards , the thickness of the body is assumed negligible for sake of simplicity .",
    "the system is immersed in a perfect gas in equilibrium at temperature @xmath9 and with constant density @xmath10 , assumed in the mean field approximation .",
    "( that is the limit in which the mass of the particles goes to zero , while the number of particles per unit volume diverges , so that the mass density stays finite . )",
    "we will study the force exerted by the gas on to the body moving at a fixed velocity .",

    "let then @xmath23 be the mass density in the phase space of the gas particles .",
    "it evolves according to the free vlasov equation : @xmath24    together with eq .",
    "( [ vlasov ] ) we consider the boundary conditions .",

    "the above equation for the gas are clearly coupled with those of the body immersed in it , which are :    [ d / dt v = e- f(t ) ] @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the constant external force acting along the x - axis and @xmath42 is the action of the gas on the disk , being @xmath43 the velocity in the reference system of the body , and where @xmath44 for @xmath45 , in particular @xmath21 .",

    "the term @xmath63 takes into account all the collisions happening during @xmath64 , thus : @xmath65where @xmath66 labels all particles around the body that are hitting @xmath47 within @xmath64 , and @xmath67 denotes terms @xmath68    let @xmath69 be a volume of the phase space of measure @xmath70 , centered at the point @xmath71 and @xmath72 the number of particles contained in it at time @xmath60 , so that : @xmath73where @xmath74 ranges over positions and velocities that will give rise to collision in @xmath75 .",

    "given the evolution of the body @xmath111 , @xmath58 , there is a unique backward time evolution leading to the initial position and velocity , ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "such backward evolution is free motion up to possible collision - times in which the particle hits the body . on these times",
    "we keep track of the particle displacement through condition ( [ boundary conditions ] ) .",
    "we proceed in this way until we reach the desired @xmath112 , @xmath113 . at the end using the initial state of the gas distribution , eq.([distribuzione di maxwell ] ) , we obtain    @xmath114    where @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
