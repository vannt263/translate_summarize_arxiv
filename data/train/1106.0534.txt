    "the fundamental upper bound for these norms was established by hrmander @xcite and sogge @xcite , who prove that    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the piecewise linear function of @xmath8 given by    @xmath9    moreover , these bounds were shown by sogge @xcite to be sharp when @xmath1 is the round @xmath2-sphere @xmath10 .",

    "if one assumes that @xmath3 is an eigenfunction of all the translations @xmath13 then @xmath3 is a complex exponential , and so we have @xmath14 for all @xmath15 and @xmath16 depending only on @xmath12 .",
    "a more interesting example of this phenomenon is given by sarnak in his letter to morawetz @xcite .",

    "this upper bound is also sharp in the case when @xmath17 is of compact type , and sarnak states that it should be considered as the ` convex bound ' for the sup norm of a higher rank eigenfunction .",
    "+ the goal of this paper is to derive the correct convex bound for all @xmath0 norms of an eigenfunction in higher rank , by combining basic techniques from semiclassics with a detailed analysis of spherical functions . our main result in this direction is stated below , which in the compact case differs from the expected sharp bound only by a factor of @xmath26 at the kink point .",
    "let @xmath17 be a compact locally symmetric space of dimension @xmath2 and rank @xmath18 which is a quotient of the globally symmetric space @xmath27 , and assume that @xmath27 is irreducible .",

    "our bounds will be sharp up to the @xmath50 in the case of both compact and noncompact type . the fact that this bound is sharp for individual eigenfunctions in the compact case is due to the high multiplicity of the spectrum , so that by choosing the radius of our spectral projector to be sufficiently small we know that it will always pick out exactly one eigenvalue of high multiplicity .    in both cases",
