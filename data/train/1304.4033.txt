    "three more outbursts were detected by the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on board the _ ginga _ satellite in the 19871992 time frame ( kitamoto et al .",
    "1993 ) . despite this high number of events ,",
    "the sky coverage was not complete and some outbursts might have been lost .",
    "interestingly , the recurrence period of the outbursts was short in the seventies , around 125 d ( priedhorsky & terrell 1984 ) , but it became longer in the eighties , around 300 d ( kitamoto et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the rossi x  ray timing explorer ( @xmath4 , 19962012 , levine et al . 1996 ) and more recently the monitor all - sky x  ray image ( @xmath5 , 2009now , matsuoka et al .",

    "2011 , the @xmath4/asm detected twenty outbursts from aql x-1 ( two in common with @xmath5 ) .",
    "these data provide a unique database for investigations on outburst recurrence times and energetics .",
    "the limiting sensitivity of @xmath4/asm is such that in the case of aql x-1 we can follow the outburst decay down to a 210 kev luminosity of @xmath6 ( at a distance of 5 kpc ; jonker & nelemans 2004 ) . in the case of",
    "@xmath5 we can reach a somewhat better ( within a factor of two ) limiting sensitivity .",
    "in addition to the possibility of detecting faint outbursts , this luminosity is sufficiently faint to allow us to investigate the outburst s decay law .",
    "king & ritter ( 1998 ) showed that x  ray heating during the decay from an outburst causes the light curves of lmxts to show either exponential or linear decays , depending on whether or not the x  ray luminosity is sufficiently high to keep the outer disc edge hot .",
    "the rationale behind this is that if the disc s outer portion is hot the entire disc is hot and matter can be efficiently transferred to the compact object , delivering a fast drain of the accretion disc .    in this paper",
    "we exploit the @xmath4/asm ( and @xmath5 ) database on aql x-1 . in section 2",
    "we discuss the data and characterise the outbursts . in section 3",
    "we focus on correlations among outburst properties and we fit the decay profiles of the outbursts to derive the outer disc radius ( section 4 ) . in section 5",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "the @xmath4/asm consisted of three position - sensitive scanning shadow cameras ( levine et al .",
    "@xmath4 started operating in jan .",
    "the satellite was slowly spinning , observing sources for 90 s ( dwell ) during the 96 min duration of each orbit .",
    "raw data points provided the fitted source rates in the 1.512 kev energy band from one dwell .",
    "one - day averages are more commonly used , resulting from the average of the fitted source rates from the dwells during that time interval ( typically 5 - 10 ) .",
    "each measurement ( count rate ) has an error associated , coming from the quadrature average of the estimated errors on the individual dwells .",

    "using this value for @xmath10 all the derived radii are also smaller than the @xmath15 radius , consistent with expectations ( see fig .",

    "the same constraint can be applied to the luminosity radius @xmath16 . in this case",
    "we derive @xmath17 @xmath14 s erg@xmath2 . again , imposing this value , all the radii are also consistent to be smaller than the @xmath15 radius ( see fig .",
    "[ enetqui ] ) .",
    "-0.1truecm    assuming these values for @xmath10 and @xmath11 one can compare the two determinations of the radii with the two methods finding a relatively good agreement , with only a few outliers .",
    "overall there is a factor of @xmath18 variation in the estimated outer disc radii among different outbursts .",
    "this can be due to ( small ) variations in the outer disc radius , outer disc viscosity , or irradiation parameter .",
    "the outbursts from aql x-1 observed by @xmath4/asm span a long time interval ( jan 1996  sep 2011 ) .",
    "twenty outbursts were recorded .",
    "outbursts occur mainly in the fred flavour and often with secondary maxima ( see table 1 ) .",
    "peak luminosities can be divided into two separated groups : 11 outbursts fall within @xmath19 erg s@xmath2 and 9 within @xmath20 erg s@xmath2 with no outbursts in between ( factor of @xmath21 luminosity gap ) .",
    "ideally one would expect a correlation between the outburst peak luminosity and the recurrence time but this is not the case ( see fig .",
    "[ outbpeak ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ outbpeak ] we also included outbursts from _",
    "vela 5b _ and _ ariel 5 _ ( kitamoto et al . 1993 ) . due to",
    "the higher limiting fluxes of these instruments , all the old outbursts fall in the bright group . a weak correlation ( @xmath22 probability , according to the spearman rank test ) is present among these two variables , including the @xmath4 outbursts and the _ vela 5b _ and _ ariel 5 _ ones ( see fig .",
    "[ outbpeak ] ) .",
    "one can also expect a correlation among the peak outburst luminosity and the total energy of the outburst .",
    "this is not the case as shown in fig .",
    "[ lpeakene ] . according to a spearman rank correlation test",
    ", there is @xmath23 of a chance correlation .",
    "this is due to the presence of @xmath18 long - lasting low peak luminosity outbursts with a large emitted energy as well as @xmath24 short - duration high peak luminosity low energetic burst .",
    "this indicates that the peak outburst luminosity is not a good tracer of the outburst energetics .    -0.1truecm",
    "-0.1truecm    we model the outburst decays with a combination of exponential and linear functions following powell et al .",
    "a note of caution should be added since not all the low mass transient outbursts can be described by this model .",
    "a clear example is provided by the 2004 outburst from igr j00291 + 5934 showing a bright outburst with a clear linear decay ( hartman , galloway & chakrabarty 2011 ) .",
    "our modeling leads to two different estimates of the outer disc radius depending on the outer disc viscosity and on the outer disc irradiation properties . imposing that the outer disc radius lies between the circularisation radius and the distance between the neutron star and the inner lagrangian point",
    ", we can constrain these two parameters . in particular , we derive @xmath13 @xmath14 s@xmath2 and @xmath17 @xmath14 s erg@xmath2 .",
    "the viscosity estimate is somewhat larger than the value obtained by powell et al .",
    "these authors found @xmath25 @xmath14 s@xmath2 ( factor of @xmath26 smaller ) , considering short orbital period accreting millisecond pulsars .",
    "the value we derived is also somewhat larger than the one obtained by shahbaz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for aql x-1 ( factor 35 ) , based , however , on a simpler modeling .",
    "this might be related to the very long orbital period of aql x-1 , pushing the outer disc edge a factor of 10100 out with respect to the systems considered by powell et al .",
    "the only long orbital period system considered by powell et al .",
    "( 2007 ) is the bursting pulsar gro j174428 ( @xmath27 d ) , which is indeed characterised by a factor of @xmath28 longer exponential decay time , confirming the increasing trend of the viscosity for larger accretion disk outer edges .",
    "the irradiation parameter is instead lower than current estimates : @xmath29 @xmath14 s erg@xmath2 based on king & ritter ( 1998 ) or @xmath30 @xmath14 s erg@xmath2 on powell et al .",
    "our value is consistent with the latter estimate ( just a factor of @xmath31 lower ) , whereas longer orbital period systems , such as gro j174428 , are characterised by @xmath32 @xmath14 s@xmath2 , indicating that irradiation effects play minor role .    adopting our values for @xmath10 and @xmath11 we found a good agreement among the two different outer radii estimates based on the outburst decay light curve fitting . from fig .",
    "[ enetqui ] it is apparent that , for common values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the outer radius can span a factor of @xmath18 variation among different outbursts .    given our 20 yr baseline we can compute the mean mass accretion rate of aql x-1 , integrating the observed luminosity .",
    "the mean mass accretion rate is @xmath33 g s@xmath2 ( assuming a standard 1.4 @xmath34 and 10 km neutron star ) .",
    "given the 18.97 hr orbital period , this value places aql x-1 well within the unstable region of the disc instability model ( lasota 2001 ) .    finally , we estimated a mean recurrence time for the system of @xmath35 d ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this is considerably longer than the early recurrence time ( @xmath37 d ) estimated by priedorsky & terrell ( 1984 ) and more in line with the estimate of @xmath38 d by kitamoto et al .",
    "( 1993 ; see also imon 2002 ) .",
    "we also note that dim outbursts ( those with a peak luminosity lower than @xmath39 erg s@xmath2 ) are more regular with a recurrence of @xmath40 d ( @xmath41 dispersion ) . with a frequency of 1.36 outbursts per year in the @xmath4 era ,",
