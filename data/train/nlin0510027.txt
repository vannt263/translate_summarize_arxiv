    "synchronization of coupled chaotic systems is a field of growing interest in view of its potential applications in diverse area of research activities such as secure communication , cryptography , controlling , long term prediction of chaotic systems , etc.@xcite . since the identification of chaotic synchronization different kinds of them",
    "have been proposed in interacting chaotic systems both theoretically and experimentally : complete synchronization @xcite , generalized synchronization @xcite , phase synchronization @xcite , lag synchronization @xcite and anticipatory synchronization@xcite .",
    "one of the most important applications of chaos synchronization is secure communication .",
    "it has been shown that in secure communication based on simple low dimensional chaotic systems with only one positive lyapunov exponent , the hidden message can be unmasked by dynamical reconstruction of the chaotic signal using nonlinear dynamical forecasting methods or by using some simple return maps @xcite .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is to consider chaos synchronization in higher dimensional systems having multiple positive lyapunov exponents , based on the consideration that increased randomness and unpredictability of the hyperhcaotic signals will make it more difficult to extract the masked message .",
    "recently , chaotic time - delay systems have been suggested as good candidates for secure communication @xcite as the time - delay systems exhibit the intriguing characteristics of increase in the embedding dimension and the number of positive lyapunov exponents with the time - delay inspite of its small number of physical variables .",
    "therefore the study of chaos synchronization in time - delay systems is of considerable practical significance .",
    "recently , we have shown that even a single scalar delay equation with piecewise linear function can exhibit hyperchaotic behavior even for small values of time - delay @xcite and hence it is of interest to consider chaos synchronization in such scalar piecewise linear delay differential equations with appropriate coupling between them . for the present study",
    ", we will consider chaos synchronization between two such time - delay systems with unidirectional coupling and having two different time - delays : one in the individual systems , namely , feedback delay @xmath0 and the other in the coupling term @xmath1 .",
    "we have arrived at the stability condition for synchronization following krasovskii - lyapunov theory , which shows that the stability condition is independent of the delay times , and demonstrate that there exist transitions between three different kinds of synchronization , namely , anticipatory , complete and lag synchronizations by simply tuning the second time - delay parameter in the coupling , for a fixed set of other system parameters satisfying appropriate stability condition .",
    "the results have been corroborated by the nature of similarity functions . to enhance the security , delay time modulation is introduced at the feedback delay and the stability of the synchronization manifold with delay time modulation is calculated .",
    "we have also identified a new type of oscillating synchronization as a consequence of delay time modulation .",
    "we consider the following first order delay differential equation introduced by lu and he  @xcite and discussed in detail in references  @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are parameters , @xmath5 is the constant time - delay and @xmath6 is an odd piecewise linear function defined by the relation @xmath7 this system exhibits hyperchaotic behavior for the parameter values @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the hyperchaotic nature was confirmed by the existence of multiple positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "the first ten maximal lyapunov exponents as a function of @xmath5 for the chosen parameter values is shown in fig .  [ fig.one ] . in our present study , we have included three linear parts for the function @xmath10 in eq .  [ eqoneb ] .",
    "one may also carry out the studies with two linear parts alone .",
    "however , the dynamics in the three linear part case is richer and so we confine our study to this case alone here .",
    "the first ten maximal lyapunov exponents @xmath11 of the scalar time - delay equation ( [ eqonea ] ) for the parameter values @xmath12 @xmath13 . ]",
    "now let us consider the following unidirectionally coupled drive @xmath14 and response @xmath15 systems with two different time - delays @xmath0 and @xmath1 as feedback and coupling time - delays , respectively , @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constants , @xmath20 , and @xmath10 is of the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ eqoneb ] ) .",
    "now we can deduce the stability condition for synchronization of the two time - delay systems eqs .",
    "( [ eq.onea ] ) and ( [ eq.oneb ] ) in the presence of the delay coupling @xmath21 .",
    "the time evolution of the difference system with the state variable @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , can be written for small values of @xmath24 by using the evolution eqs .",
    "( 3 ) as @xmath25 in order to study the stability of the synchronization manifold , we choose the parametric condition , @xmath26 so that the evolution equation for the difference system @xmath24 becomes @xmath27 the synchronization manifold is locally attracting if the origin of this equation is stable . following krasovskii - lyapunov functional approach @xcite",
    ", we define a positive definite lyapunov functional of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an arbitrary positive parameter , @xmath30 .",
    "note that @xmath31 approaches zero as @xmath32 .    to estimate a sufficient condition for the stability of the solution @xmath33",
    ", we require the derivative of the functional @xmath31 along the trajectory of eq .",
    "( [ eq.difsys ] ) , @xmath34 to be negative .",
    "after simple algebra , one can find the sufficient condition for asymptotic stability as @xmath35 along with the condition ( [ eq.paracon ] ) on the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath19 .    now from the form of the piecewise linear function @xmath10 given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we have , @xmath37 consequently the stability condition ( [ eq.asystab ] ) becomes @xmath38 along with the parametric restriction @xmath39 .",
    "thus one can take @xmath40 as a less stringent condition for ( [ eq.asystab ] ) to be valid , while @xmath41 as the most general condition specified by ( [ eq.asystab ] ) for asymptotic stability of the synchronized state @xmath33 .",
    "the condition ( [ eq.four ] ) indeed corresponds to the stability condition for exact anticipatory , identical as well as lag synchronizations for suitable values of the coupling delay @xmath1 .",
    "it may also be noted that the stability condition ( [ eq.four ] ) is independent of the both the delay parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "to start with , we demonstrate that there exists a region of anticipatory synchronization when @xmath42 at the synchronization manifold . for this purpose ,",
    "we have fixed the value of feedback delay @xmath0 at @xmath43 while the other parameters are fixed as @xmath44 and the coupling delay @xmath1 is considered as a control parameter . for all values of @xmath42 , we find from the evolution equation ( [ eq.difsys ] ) , the difference variable @xmath45 with @xmath46 approaches zero asymptotically , so that @xmath47 , thereby demonstrating the existence of anticipatory synchronization with anticipating time as @xmath5 . the existence of anticipatory synchronization is characterized by the nature of similarity functions for different values of @xmath48 , the parameter whose value determines the stability of the synchronization manifold as may be seen from eqn .",
    "( [ eq.four ] ) .",
    "now we use the notion of similarity function to characterize anticipatory synchronization which was originally introduced by rosenblum _",
    "@xcite to characterize lag synchronization .",
    "similarity function is defined as a time - averaged difference between the variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( with mean values being subtracted ) taken with the positive time shift @xmath5 for lag synchronization and negative time shift @xmath51 for anticipatory synchronization , @xmath52 ^ 2\\rangle } { [ \\langle x_{1}^2(t)\\rangle\\langle x_{2}^2(t)\\rangle]^{1/2 } } , s_l^2(\\tau)=\\frac{\\langle[x_2(t+\\tau)-x_1(t)]^2\\rangle } { [ \\langle x_{1}^2(t)\\rangle\\langle x_{2}^2(t)\\rangle]^{1/2 } } , \\label{anti : sim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 means time average over the variable @xmath54 . if the minimum value of @xmath55 reaches zero , that is @xmath56 , then there exists a time shift @xmath51 between the two signals @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that @xmath57 , demonstrating the existence of anticipatory synchronization between the drive @xmath49 and the response @xmath50 signals .",

    "a further significance is that the anticipating time @xmath73 is an adjustable quantity as long as @xmath74 , which can be tuned suitably to satisfy experimental situations .",

    "we find from the evolution equation ( [ eq.difsys ] ) , the difference variable @xmath45 with @xmath82 approaches zero asymptotically , so that @xmath83 , thereby demonstrating the existence of lag synchronization with lag time equal to @xmath71 .",

    "the minimum of similarity function @xmath79 occurs for values of @xmath87 , where the minimum does not occur at zero and hence there is a lack of exact lag time between the drive and response signals indicating asynchronization .",

    "[ lsim ] is only a specific example exhibiting exact lag synchronization .",
    "any other choice of parameters satisfying the condition ( [ eq.paracon ] ) subject to @xmath75 is good enough to obtain the above phenomenon .",
    "we have also confirmed that as in the case of anticipatory synchronization , when the parameter @xmath48 varies , the onset of exact lag synchronization is preceded by a region of approximate lag synchronization , which is characterized by a transition from on - off intermittency of the desynchronized state to a periodic structure in the laminar phase distribution .",
    "to improve the security of the above type of synchronized systems , we have extended our studies by choosing time - delay as a function of time .",
    "recently , the concept of delay time modulation was introduced by kye _",
    "et al _ @xcite and they have shown that reconstruction of phase space of the time - delay systems is hardly possible as a consequence of delay time modulation .",
    "now , we will introduce the delay time modulation in the systems ( [ eq.onea ] ) and ( [ eq.oneb ] ) at the feedback delays @xmath91 in the form @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the zero frequency component , @xmath94 is the amplitude and @xmath95 is the frequency of the modulation . here",
    "the coupling delay @xmath1 is kept constant .",
    "the stability condition for synchronization of the systems ( [ eq.onea ] ) and ( [ eq.oneb ] ) with delay time modulation can be obtained as ( by following the same procedure as for the case of constant feedback delay given in section 3 ) , @xmath96 along with the condition ( [ eq.paracon ] ) on the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath19 . once again as in the previous case , from the form of piecewise function @xmath10 , one can take @xmath97 as a less stringent condition for ( [ eq.asystab1 ] ) to be valid , while @xmath98 as the most general condition specified by ( [ eq.asystab1 ] ) for asymptotic stability of the synchronized state .    oscillating synchronization from lag to anticipatory synchronization via complete synchronization for @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "drive @xmath14 is represented by @xmath101 and response @xmath15 by @xmath102 . ]",
    "we have fixed the value of @xmath99 and @xmath100 with the same value of @xmath3 and @xmath4 as previously studied . for the value of @xmath103",
    "the general stability condition ( [ eq.asystab1 ] ) is satisfied . for the chosen values of @xmath93 and @xmath94",
    ", one can find that @xmath0 oscillates between ( @xmath104 ) 10 and 190 .",
    "hence for any value of coupling delay @xmath1 less than 10 , @xmath1 is always less than @xmath91 , one can find from the evolution equation ( [ eq.difsys ] ) the difference variable @xmath105 with @xmath106 approaches zero asymptotically , so that @xmath107 , implying the existence of anticipatory synchronization with the time dependent anticipating time @xmath106 . similarly for any value of coupling delay @xmath1 greater than 190 , that is for @xmath1 always greater than @xmath91 , we have @xmath108 , demonstrating the existence of lag synchronization . on the other hand , when the coupling delay @xmath1 is chosen in between 10 and 190 ,",
    "one is able to find that the feedback delay @xmath91 is less than @xmath1 for some time ( inwhich case @xmath109 , so that there exists lag synchronization @xmath108 ) and as @xmath91 increases eventually , it approaches @xmath15 at a certain time , where @xmath110 , so that @xmath78 , that is there exists complete synchronization for a specific value of time . as @xmath91 exceeds the value of @xmath1 , now @xmath111 becomes negative , @xmath112 with @xmath113 , there exists anticipatory synchronization .",
    "therefore as time evolves there is oscillation between lag , complete and anticipatory synchronization with time dependent anticipating and lag times .",
    "[ osc ] shows the evolution of the drive @xmath14 and the response @xmath15 at the transition between lag to anticipatory synchronization via complete synchronization , whereas fig .",
    "[ osc2 ] shows the evolution of the drive @xmath14 and the response @xmath15 at the next transition between anticipatory to lag via complete synchronization .",

    "oscillating synchronization from anticipatory to lag synchronization via complete synchronization for @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "drive @xmath14 is represented by @xmath101 and response @xmath15 by @xmath102 . ]",
    "in summary , we have obtained the stability condition for synchronization in a system of two coupled piecewise linear differential equation following krasovskii - lyapunov functional approach for both the case of constant and time dependent delay .",
    "we have demonstrated that there exists regimes of anticipatory , complete and lag synchronizations with coupling delay @xmath1 as control parameter for constant delay case with anticipating and lag time as @xmath71 .",
    "the exact synchronization regimes are preceded by a regime of approximate synchronization from the desynchronized state as a function of parameter @xmath48 , which determines the stability condition .",
    "the existence of anticipatory and lag synchronizations are characterized by the similarity functions . in the case of time",
    "dependent delay , we have demonstrated that there exists regimes of anticipatory and lag synchronization with time dependent anticipating and lag times for suitable values of coupling delay @xmath1 .",
    "we have also shown the existence of new type of oscillating synchronization that oscillates between lag , complete and anticipatory synchronizations as a consequence of delay time modulation , when the value of coupling delay @xmath1 is chosen in between @xmath114 and @xmath115 with varying anticipating and lag times .",
    "we believe that this new type of oscillating synchronization with time dependent anticipating and lag times will enhance the security of secure communication and now we are implementing this experimentally through electronic circuits .    this work has been supported by a department of science and technology , government of india sponsored research project .",
