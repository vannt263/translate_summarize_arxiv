    "we consider flows in a flat two - dimensional ( 2d ) surface that bounds a three - dimensional ( 3d ) volume with turbulent fluid motion .",
    "the boundary conditions are that of a free - slip surface so that the normal velocity component vanishes but the parallel components are not further constrained . to some extent , this is the situation of surface currents on a river or the sea , if waves and ripples are absent or can be neglected .",
    "particles floating on the surface reflect the properties of the flow and provide an easy visualization .",
    "these flows have an obvious connection to oceanographical applications@xcite , but they apparently have not been studied in further detail . even in the recent theoretical and experimental investigations of the statistical properties of the particle distribution by ott and co - workers",
    "@xcite the modelling was based on random dissipative maps and not on the underlying flow .",
    "similarly , saichev and co - workers @xcite based their investigation of passive particle advection and cluster formation on gaussian random velocity fields , white in time .",
    "thus , one of our aims here is to analyze the properties of surface flows arising from navier  stokes dynamics and to connect them to the statistics of particles floating on the surface , along the lines of our previous work on passive scalars advected in two - dimensional turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "the flow in the surface is two - dimensional , but it has properties that are different from that of the usual two - dimensional incompressible navier - stokes turbulence .",
    "obviously , the velocity field is not constrained by mass conservation in the surface : there can be up- and down - welling motions in the ( incompressible ) bulk which on the surface will appear as sources and sinks for the velocity field .",
    "velocity and vorticity can be exchanged with the bulk flow underneath , so that in the inviscid limit without forcing neither kinetic energy nor enstrophy are conserved .",
    "such effects of compressibility arise also in experiments in two - dimensional turbulence in soap films and were discussed recently @xcite .    the experiments of goldburg _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite are close to a laboratory realization of the kinds of flows that are investigated here .",
    "a vertically oscillating grid in a tank of water is used to produce turbulence .",
    "if the water surface is sufficiently far away from the grid it remains essentially flat and the surface flow can be visualized with mushrooom spores .",
    "the measured statistical properties of the flow are close to the ones that we will derive here .",
    "this opens the way to further experimental studies of the statistical properties of the velocity field and of the particle dynamics in this interesting flow .",
    "finally , we should like to point out that the flows are also of interest from a theoretical point of view , since they can be thought of as flows with a symmetry plane : let the surface be @xmath1 and consider the reflection symmetry that under @xmath2 goes to @xmath3 the @xmath2-component of the velocity field changes sign .",
    "this is a symmetry of the navier - stokes equation , that is to say , if initial conditions and driving preserve this symmetry so does the time evolved flow .",
    "it is our aim here to derive the equations of motion for such a flow ( section iia ) , to discuss the correlation function if the 3d flow is turbulent ( section iib ) , to present numerical results on the statistics of the velocity , vorticity , and divergence fields and on the boundary layer thickness ( section iii ) and to derive a relation between the fractal dimension and the velocity correlation function for the advection of scalars within geometric scaling theory ( section iv ) .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section v.",
    "in order to arrive at the properties of such a flow , two approaches are possible : one relies on an explicit representation of the flow field with proper boundary conditions and the other seeks to derive the equations of motion from the 3-d navier - stokes equation .",
    "they provide complementary information on the system .",
    "we begin with the equations of motion and the effects of symmetry .",
    "let @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , be the @xmath7- , @xmath8- , and @xmath2-components of the velocity field ( fig .  1 ) and",
    "let @xmath9 be the pressure field .",

    "1 . flow geometry . the surface flow lives in the shaded surface above a turbulent bulk flow . @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the coordinates in the surface and @xmath2 is the one normal to it . in the numerical simulation",
    "the flow is driven by a shear flow in the @xmath7-direction with variations in @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests to expand the velocity components in power series in @xmath2 , with only odd powers for @xmath6 , and only even ones for @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath9 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 substitution into the navier - stokes equation and ordering with respect to powers of @xmath2 gives for the two main components of interest , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the equations @xmath16 the hat superscripts on position vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 , on the velocity field @xmath19 , on the gradient @xmath20 and on the laplace operator @xmath21 indicate that they are restricted to the components @xmath7 and @xmath8 that lie in the surface .",
    "the driving of the turbulence is modelled by a volume force with components @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; as usual we expect that the statistical properties of the flow depend only weakly ( through intermittency ) on the kind of driving as long as it is confined to large scales .",

    "these terms are externally given and can hence be included in the volume driving forces .",
    "note , however , that now the driving is no longer confined to large scales , as assumed in the usual scaling analysis . with all unspecified terms absorbed into effective volume forces @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the equations of motion for @xmath38 and @xmath39 become finally @xmath40 the equations are completed by ( [ pressure ] ) with @xmath41 for the pressure .",
    "these equations have unusual properties .",
    "for instance , dotting with @xmath42 and integrating over a 2d volume , the energy is not conserved in the eulerian limit where viscosity and driving are absent . with the local energy density , @xmath43 and using eq .",
    "( [ conti ] ) for @xmath44 the global energy balance reads @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the average over the surface @xmath47 . thus energy",
    "is permanently put in and taken out according to the gradients of the @xmath2-component of @xmath19 and the pressure fluctuations . over large time intervals",
    "one can expect that a flow equilibrium with constant average energy is established and that the time average of the right hand side of ( [ e - ave ] ) vanishes .",
    "it seems that the lack of energy conservation on short times gives rise to larger fluctuations and larger intermittency corrections ( see below and @xcite ) .",
    "a similar discussion applies to the vorticity , and will be given in section iiib below .",
    "the alternative approach mentioned above starts from an explicit representation of the 3d velocity field that takes the boundary conditions into account .",
    "consider the fourier expansion of the velocity field , @xmath48 where the summation extends over all 2d wave vectors @xmath49 in the surface and all integers @xmath50 .",
    "the sine and cosine terms take into account the stress - free boundary conditions at the top and bottom surface , @xmath51 incompressibility requires @xmath52 one advantage of this representation is that it quickly leads to a prediction for the two - point correlation functions . in the 3d case",
    "kolmogorov scaling without intermittency gives for the inertial regime a decay of amplitudes @xmath53 @xcite . in the surface ,",
    "the 2d amplitudes are obtained by summation on @xmath50 .",
    "this brings in a factor of @xmath54 that compensates the one missing from the volume element , which is @xmath55 in 2d rather than @xmath56 as in 3d .",
    "as a net result scaling of the correlation function does not change .",
    "however , the absence of the third component of the velocity field reduces the amplitude to two third of its three - dimensional value . for the second order structure function , defined as @xmath57 we expect in the inertial regime @xmath58 where again the hat distinguishes the 2d surface from the 3d bulk structure function .",

    "the increase in intermittency seems to be connected with an increase in fluctuations due to lack of incompressibility and lack of energy conservation .",
    "it is in line with results for passive scalar transport in models with compressible gaussian random flows that are @xmath96-correlated in time @xcite and with direct numerical simulations @xcite of isotropic supersonic turbulence .",
    "interestingly , in the latter case the authors also noted a strong difference to incompressible turbulence near the crossover to the viscous subrange . in their case vortex filaments of high intensity and narrow regions of strong negative divergence ,",

    "in our situation it is the fluctuations due to normal shear and normal velocity components below the surface that have a strong effect near the crossover to the viscous subrange .    in the viscous subrange",
    "the amplitudes of the structure functions agree , but in the inertial subrange the surface structure function is smaller by a factor of @xmath0 . in the previous section we explained the reduction in amplitude in the inertial range by the reduction in the number of active degrees of freedom or fourier modes . in the viscous subrange",
    "this argument does not apply , since we absorbed many additional contributions to the equations of motion into the volume driving force .",
    "the amplitude is larger since these extra contributions also have to be dissipated , but it should not exceed that of a 3d structure function since they originally come from a 3d flow .",
    "so in the viscous subrange the reduction in dimensionality is not noticable and the structure functions coincide .",
    "another quantity of interest in 2d flows is the vorticity @xmath97 and the structure function , @xmath98 in 2d incompressible turbulence squared vorticity is an additional inviscid invariant and gives rise to an inverse cascade of energy . in 3d",
    "a vortex stretching term @xmath99 is present that prevents a conservation of enstrophy . in 2d and for the normal component of the vorticity",
    "this reduces to a normal gradient of the velocity field which by incompressibility is connected to the divergence of the flow field in the surface .",
    "thus , for the 2d free surface flow the vorticity transport equation reads @xmath100 thus , the non - vanishing divergence of the surface flow provides a kind of additional vorticity forcing in 2d .",
    "consequently , squared vorticity can not be an inviscid invariant , and no inverse cascade develops .",

    "is shown in fig .",

    "5 shows that the probability density function of the vorticity deviates from a gaussian distribution and has the exponentially stretched tails that are typical for intermittent quantities .",

    "using gauss theorem and green s formula it can be shown @xcite that the third term is subdominant compared to the fourth , @xmath170 and hence can be omitted in the following .",
    "finally , we come to the new term , @xmath171 , which contains the divergence of the velocity field . application of the cauchy - schwartz inequality gives @xmath172 where the root mean square of the divergence is measured in units of the kolmogorov time @xmath109 .",

    "this is always the case . on the other hand ,",

    "the underlying turbulent velocity field is the surface flow for @xmath67 as shown in fig .  2 and @xmath197 .",
    "the surface flows studied here are intermediate between two- and three - dimensional flows .",
    "they are confined to a surface , but their statistical properties are strongly influenced , even dominated by the 3d volume turbulence .",
    "the flow field in the surface can exchange energy and vorticity with the bulk , so that neither energy nor enstrophy are conserved quantities in the eulerian , undriven limit .",
    "moreover , in addition to large scale forces that maintain the 3d flow the surface flow is driven by small scale perturbations that come from transversal pressure variations and local gradients in normal velocity . as a result",
    "the scaling properties of the flow are essentially that of 3d turbulence , with an energy cascade in the inertial regime .",
    "the scaling exponents of the velocity structure function are slightly larger than those of bulk 3d turbulent flows , indicating larger intermittency effects .",
    "we also observed a 2/3 difference in the amplitude of the structure functions between surface and bulk in the inertial regime .",
    "several of the observed characteristics of the surface flow are in agreement with the measurements of the pittsburgh group @xcite .",
    "we have also discussed the scaling properties of a scalar advected by the surface flow and have identified different scaling regimes .",
    "it seems that very often the dynamics induced by the divergence of the flow field is the fastest process , and that the advective properties of the flow are subdominant .",
    "this might explain why random mappings could succesfully be applied to the modelling of the particle distributions @xcite , but a more detailed comparison between theory and experiment is clearly needed .",
    "an important characteristic quantity of the surface flows is the compressibility factor @xmath139 .",
    "the numerical simulations and the pittsburgh experiment using a vertically oscillating grid indicate both @xmath110 . with a stable stratification of the fluid below the surface that reduces vertical fluctuations it might be possible to achieve smaller values of @xmath139 .",
    "this should open up the possibility to study the effects of compressibility over a larger range of @xmath139 , both in connection with the intermittency contributions to the scaling exponents and with the scalar dynamics in surface flows .",
