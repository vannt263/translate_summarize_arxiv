    "there is currently a renewed interest in the study of long - range interacting systems , particularly outside the realm of astrophysics",
    ". these systems may exhibit inequivalence of statistical ensembles ( _ e.g. _ canonical _ vs _ microcanonical ) which affects their equilibrium properties ( possibility of negative specific heat in the microcanonical ensemble ) and even more dramatically , their dynamical properties . in the context of self - gravitating systems ,",
    "the newtonian dynamics is too complicated to permit an exhaustive analytical treatment .",
    "hence , in the past few years , we have developed a model of self - gravitating particles in the presence of a strong friction and a random force @xcite , for which inertial effects are negligible .",
    "the main interest of this model is to be analytically tractable in many situations , while presenting dynamical phases reminiscent of their newtonian counterparts .",
    "in addition , this model is intimately related to the keller - segel model of bacterial chemotaxis @xcite .",
    "we thus consider particles obeying the equations of motion @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a delta correlated random gaussian force , and @xmath8 is the gravitational potential . in a proper mean - field limit , which becomes exact for an infinite number of particles",
    ", the density obeys a fokker - planck ( or smoluchowski ) equation coupled to the poisson equation ( the gravitational constant is set equal to @xmath9 ) : @xmath10 the pressure is related to the diffusion coefficient by @xmath2 , and the isothermal case corresponds to @xmath11 , while we will consider here the more general polytropic case @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the system of total mass @xmath13 can be placed in a spherical bounded domain of radius @xmath14 or in an unbounded space .    in the context of chemotaxis @xcite , @xmath1 is the density of bacteria , and @xmath15 is the density of a chemical that they secrete .",
    "the bacteria are attracted by the regions of high density of this chemical which generates an effective long - range interaction between them .",
    "this interaction exactly takes the form of gravity when neglecting the diffusion and the degradation of the chemical .",
    "although we shall see that the actual phase diagram depends crucially on the value of the index @xmath4 , the general physics is controlled by the parameter @xmath5 which we assimilate to the temperature .",
    "when @xmath5 is small , the kinetic pressure is not strong enough to compensate gravity and the system may collapse . for large @xmath5 ,",
    "the system is at equilibrium in a bounded domain or evaporates in an unbounded domain . in the next section",
    ", we present the main results that we have obtained in @xcite concerning these different dynamical phases .",
    "defining the critical index @xmath17 , the system can be shown to always have a polytropic equilibrium state for @xmath18 , whether the system is confined or not .",
    "hence we shall concentrate on dynamical properties of the case @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( including the isothermal case @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) ) , and on the interesting particular case @xmath23 ( including the isothermal case @xmath21 ( @xmath24 ) ) .",
    "we have shown @xcite that in a bounded domain , and for @xmath25 , the system displays a finite time singularity at which the central density diverges as @xmath26 .",
    "the density profile takes a scale - invariant form @xmath27 $ ] , where the core radius @xmath28 is related to the central density by @xmath29 .",
    "the density scaling function decays as @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , and can be analytically obtained in the case @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) @xcite . in this important case , @xmath32",
    "was also computed exactly close to @xmath33 @xcite .    for @xmath34 , during what we dubbed the post - collapse regime @xcite",
    ", a delta peak condensate grows at the center as @xmath35 , and ultimately saturates exponentially to the total mass @xmath13 , with a rate which was computed analytically for low @xmath5 , by using semi - classical quantum methods @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the residual density obeys a reverse scaling of the form @xmath36 $ ] , where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 decays with the same exponent @xmath31 as @xmath39 .    in an unbounded domain@xcite , the gas collapses below a _ non universal _ critical temperature @xmath33 depending on the initial state , or evaporates for @xmath40 . in this evaporation regime",
    ", gravity becomes asymptotically negligible and free diffusion is observed , with sub - corrections due to gravity which have been obtained analytically @xcite .      the case of negative @xmath4 @xcite , including the logotropic case @xmath41 , is similar to the case treated above for @xmath42 , with a collapse scaling exponent @xmath31 .",
    "however , for @xmath43 , the collapse is controlled by the @xmath44 fixed point @xcite with @xmath45 .      in this critical case @xcite",
    ", @xmath33 is independent of the radius @xmath14 of the confining box ( @xmath46 , in @xmath24 ) . for @xmath25",
    ", there is still a finite time singularity but a delta peak condensate of mass @xmath47 forms at the center , at @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , the residual density takes a pseudo scale - invariant form with an effective scaling exponent @xmath49 very slowly saturating to @xmath50 , as @xmath51 goes to @xmath52 . in an unbounded domain",
    ", the gas collapses below the _ universal _ critical temperature @xmath33 , or evaporates for @xmath40 . in this evaporation regime , the scaling density profile is strongly affected by gravity and the gas expansion is such that @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "in table  [ table1 ] , we summarize the static and dynamic phase diagram of a self - gravitating gas of particles with a bare diffusion coefficient @xmath12 , where @xmath5 is the temperature and @xmath3 the spatial dimension .",
    "this table illustrates the crucial role played by the critical index @xmath17 .",
