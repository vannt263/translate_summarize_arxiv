    "over the last twenty years , growing evidence has accumulated that nearby early - type galaxies ( e / s0s ) are not always devoid of molecular gas , and can even harbour a substantial amount of it ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , often settled in a regularly rotating disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "interestingly , not all early - type galaxies with a substantial amount of molecular gas show obvious signs of ( current ) star formation ( sf ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the converse is generally true ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the @xmath8  per cent fraction of sf objects within the nearby early - type galaxy population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) appears to be superficially consistent with their @xmath9  per cent co detection rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this fact raises many as yet unanswered questions : how is the ( current ) sf ignited in early - type galaxies ?",
    "is sf coupled to the molecular discs , i.e.  do all molecular gas discs form stars ?",
    "does sf only take place in the densest regions , perhaps ill - traced by the @xmath0co lines used in most surveys ?",
    "how , if at all , does the morphology of the molecular discs and the physical characteristics of the molecular gas correlate with the ages of the stars ? in order to answer some of these questions , it is essential to study the spatially- and kinematically - resolved properties of the stellar populations , as well as those of the molecular gas in early - type galaxies ( e / s0 )",
    ". co emission can also easily trace signs of gravitational interactions or other dynamical perturbations that can help to understand how star formation is induced .",
    "observations of a sample of 48 nearby e / s0 galaxies have been carried out with a custom - designed panoramic optical integral - field spectrograph @xcite within the framework of the sauron project . a description of the sample and illustrative results can be found in @xcite .",
    "results include the detection of kinematic misalignments , twists and decoupled cores as well as central discs in roughly half of the sources @xcite .",
    "information on the ionized gas ( distribution , kinematics and ionisation ; @xcite ) and the age , metallicity and alpha - element enhancement of the stellar populations @xcite are also available .",
    "the specific angular momentum of the galaxies appears to be a dominant factor in their evolution @xcite , and all co detections are found in fast - rotating systems @xcite .    in order to study star formation in the sauron sources and understand",
    "the various phenomena observed in the stellar and ionised gas data , observations looking for central molecular gas in the nearby sauron e / s0 galaxies were obtained by @xcite .",
    "@xmath0co emission was detected in @xmath10 of @xmath11 galaxies observed with the institut de radio astronomie millimetrique ( iram ) 30 m telescope , suggesting typical gas masses in a range between a few 10@xmath12 to 10@xmath13 m@xmath14 .",
    "@xcite further found that the amount of molecular gas in the galaxies correlates with their far - infrared ( fir ) luminosities , an often - used indicator of star formation .",
    "the gas - rich sources show the most pronounced star formation , as for normal star - forming spiral galaxies .",
    "however , the lack of correlations between the molecular gas and most stellar properties suggests that the molecular gas is largely unrelated to the old , pre - existing stellar population , and might have been externally accreted , as a result for instance of a merger or interaction event @xcite .",

    "the infrared luminosity ( l@xmath17 ) is determined from the @xmath10 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20@xmath21 m fluxes using l@xmath22  =  4@xmath23d@xmath24@xmath25  f@xmath17[l@xmath14 ] , with f@xmath17[w  m@xmath27  =  1.8@xmath2810@xmath29  ( 13.48  f@xmath30  +  5.16  f@xmath31",

    "the infrared luminosities were derived from _ iras _ fluxes that were taken from the ned .",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we detected @xmath3co(j=10 ) and @xmath3co(j=21 ) emission in four out of four sources and hcn(j=10 ) emission in three out of four sources , while hco@xmath6 emission is undetected in all four sources .",
    "the spectra of the individual lines for each galaxy are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "we also overlay the @xmath0co emission from @xcite on our @xmath3co detections for a direct comparison .",
    "the line parameters obtained from gaussian fits to the data are listed in table  [ tab : tab2 ] and compared to the @xmath0co data from @xcite .",
    "all the line profiles appear to agree well with each other for each individual galaxy . only the @xmath3co(j=21 ) line in ngc4459 and ngc4526 shows some asymmetry , with a stronger blueshifted peak , but this can probably be attributed to the smaller beam at @xmath41  mm and thus a different beam filling at 3 and 1.4  mm . while the @xmath3co line emission in all galaxies except ngc  4526 strongly resembles that of @xmath0co , the @xmath3co(j=21 ) line in ngc  4526 differs from that of @xmath0co(j=21 ) .",
    "this is most likely due to a slightly different pointing during the two observations , which will be considered for the line ratios in the following discussion .",
    "it also indicates that the emission in ngc  4526 ( and probably ngc  4459 ) is slightly larger than the beam size at 1  mm .",
    "the fitted heliocentric velocities also agree with each other for all galaxies except ngc  4526 , where the measured velocities differ from each other by @xmath4290  km  s@xmath38 .",
    "however , this difference can be explained by the gaussian fit to the asymmetric line profile of the @xmath0co emission done in @xcite , which favours the stronger redshifted peak and thus shifts the line centre towards higher velocities ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "if one calculates the central velocities from the full widths at zero maximum ( fwzm ) , one finds a more consistent value of @xmath43  km  s@xmath38 .",
    "we calculated line ratios between the total of @xmath44 molecular lines observed for each galaxy ( see table  [ tab : tab3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) . to avoid systematic errors due to beam dilution effects , we only determined line ratios at similar frequencies , i.e.observed with similar beam sizes",
    ". please note that we consider the line ratio between the @xmath3co(j=21 ) and @xmath0co(j=21 ) line emission as uncertain given their different line profiles ( see discussion in the previous paragraph ) .",
    "the line ratios are compared to those in galaxies of different hubble types in table  [ tab : tab3 ] and figure  [ fig : fig2 ] . the list of galaxies of different hubble types should be regarded as representative of each type and does not attempt to be complete .",
    "we explicitly state the region of each galaxy where the line ratios have been taken .",
    "this is especially important for the very nearby galaxies such as m33 , m31 and the dwarf galaxies , for which the observations already resolve giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and can not be regarded as averaging over the central regions of each galaxy .",
    "in addition , previous studies indicate that molecular line ratios can vary significantly within a galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , especially for galaxies with an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "ngc  1068 and ngc  6951 are prominent examples of completely different chemistry and excitation conditions of the molecular gas close to the agn and in the ( star formation - dominated ) large - scale spiral arms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the @xmath3co/@xmath0co line ratios appear to be quite similar among galaxies of different hubble types , with values in general around @xmath45-@xmath46 , certain trends can nevertheless be identified .",
    "while the starburst galaxies and ( u)lirgs seem to populate the lower end of the line ratio distribution ( with values @xmath470.1 ) , three of the four sauron galaxies lie at the higher end of it , with values larger than @xmath46 in at least one of the two transitions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that the low @xmath3co/@xmath0co ratios in starburst galaxies are not a consequence of excitation conditions and/or optical depth effects , but are rather due to an actual change in the @xmath3co/@xmath0co abundance ratio itself , either by overabundant @xmath0co or underabundant @xmath3co .",
    "as numerous new massive stars are formed during a starburst , the interstellar medium will be preferentially enriched by nucleosynthesis of @xmath0c , whereas @xmath3c remains unaffected . also",
    ", at least in the case of a merger - induced starburst , the infall of large - scale gas to the centre will result in a dilution of the central @xmath3co gas , as the infalling gas is poor in @xmath3co .",
    "as for the high @xmath3co/@xmath0co line ratios in three of the four sauron galaxies , optical depth may well play a significant role , with e.g. , optically thick @xmath0co emission .",
    "the hcn/@xmath3co and hcn/@xmath0co ratios are similar to those of the ( star formation - dominated ) central regions of nearby seyfert and spiral galaxies as well as those of gmcs in dwarf galaxies ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) , but they are quite different from ( i.e. , smaller than those of ) nearby starburst galaxies and the ( agn - dominated ) circumnuclear discs ( cnds ) of some seyfert galaxies ( cnds being smaller than the central regions considered in the seyferts ) .",
    "the sauron early - type galaxies stand out most when considering the hcn / hco@xmath6 ratio , varying most significantly again not as a function of hubble type but rather of activity type ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ; see also * ? ? ?",
    ", the sauron galaxies strongly resemble the ( agn - dominated ) circumnuclear regions of some seyfert ( e.g.  ngc  1068 , ngc  6951 and m51 ) and some ( ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies ( ( u)lirgs ) .",
    "however , they differ from most starburst and the dwarf galaxies ( at least the magellanic clouds ) as well as centaurus  a ( cen  a ) . nevertheless , because of the high hcn/@xmath3co and hcn/@xmath0co ratios of these seyfert galaxies , the high hcn / hco@xmath6 ratios in the sauron early - type galaxies probably have a different origin than that in the seyferts . while the high hcn / hco@xmath6 ratios in the seyfert galaxies are believed to be a consequence of enhanced hcn emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , those in the sauron galaxies appear to be due to lowered hco@xmath6 emission instead .    hco@xmath6 is known to be enhanced over hcn in galaxies with strong starburst activity , with a likely dependence on the age of the star formation burst , i.e.  the older the star formation burst the lower the hcn / hco@xmath6 ratio ( see the examples of the evolved starburst galaxy m82 and the young starburst ngc  6946 ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this effect is thought to be a consequence of the increased rate of supernova explosions and/or the increased importance of photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) in more evolved starburst galaxies .",
    "the high hcn / hco@xmath48 ratios observed here in the four sauron targets may thus indicate that supernova explosions ( or , equally , pdrs ) only play a minor role in the gas chemistry of these early - types .",
    "it is interesting to note that the molecular line ratios of most of the sauron early - type galaxies are not very similar to those of the elliptical galaxy cen  a. cen  a rather seems to favour line ratios close to those of the dwarf galaxies in our list .",
    "this is not entirely surprising however as the molecular gas in cen  a , mostly located in the minor - axis dust lane , has almost certainly been captured during a merger event with a gas - rich dwarf or small disc galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when comparing the hcn luminosity to the ir luminosity ( a measure of star formation ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) , one finds that the four sauron sources nicely follow the ir ",
    "hcn correlation of star - forming galaxies , firmly extending the relation to lower luminosities . plotting both of these luminosities ( ir and hcn ) normalized by the @xmath0co luminosity ( thus measuring star formation efficiency against dense gas fraction ) , our early - type galaxies again lie comfortably on the relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , having both relatively average dense gas fractions and star formation efficiencies ( sfes ) .",
    "this suggests that most of the star formation in these four sauron early - type galaxies is taking place in dense gas regions , as in other nearby ( spiral ) galaxies .",
    "the dense gas fraction is however lower than what is found in truly starbursting galaxies .",
    "we detected significant @xmath3co in four out of four and hcn emission in three out of four sauron early - type galaxies , while no hco@xmath6 emission was found in any of the four sources .",
    "we find some pronounced differences in the line ratios of the sauron galaxies when compared to other nearby galaxies of different hubble and activity types .",
    "in particular , @xmath3co/@xmath0co appears slightly enhanced in three sauron galaxies compared to other galaxy types .",
    "this may indicate different molecular gas excitation conditions and/or chemistry in these sources .",
    "the closest resemblance to our four nearby sauron galaxies is found in nearby star - forming galaxies , including seyferts and dwarfs .",
    "this and the pronounced differences with starburst galaxies suggest that the four sauron galaxies exhibit star - formation rates and efficiencies more similar to quiescent , normal star - forming galaxies than to starburst galaxies , and that they do not reach the high dense molecular gas fraction found in starbursts . also , according to the high ( @xmath71 ) hcn / hco@xmath6 ratios , pdrs and/or supernovae explosions do not seem to play an important role in the chemistry of the molecular gas in our four targets .",
    "the three sauron galaxies observed in hcn nicely follow the same physical laws concerning star formation and dense molecular gas as other galaxies , at least when infrared radiation is used as the star formation tracer .",
    "although the four sauron galaxies studied in this paper form a nice subset of the sauron sample with respect to their general characteristics , they are not equally representative with respect to their molecular gas properties . they have been chosen for their strong @xmath0co emission and could thus in principal be extreme cases within the sample .",
    "follow - up observations of the @xmath3co , hcn and hco@xmath6 emission in a much larger sample of nearby early - type galaxies are currently underway based on the success of this pilot study .",
    "these will eventually allow us to confirm ( or discard ) the trends found in this pilot project and put them on a sounder statistical basis .",
    "we thank the iram staff at the iram 30  m telescope at pico veleta for their help during the observations .",
    "we would like to thank various members of the sauron team for useful discussions throughout this project and the referee for a thorough review of the paper .",
