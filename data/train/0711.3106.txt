    "financial market modelling lies in the field of interests of both theoreticians and practitioners . among those who develop these models are also econophysicisits . a view on a financial market as a complex system of investors similar to complex physical systems appeared to be very fruitful , since it allowed to reproduce many characteristic features of such a market @xcite .",
    "a special group constitute approaches based on the ising model @xcite or its generalization to a three - state model @xcite .",
    "they identify agents with spin variables which can take specific values depending on agents decisions . in much the same way as ising spins ,",
    "agents interact with each other , which leads to a herding behavior and , as a consequence , bubbles or crashes .",
    "an important target for such models is a reproduction of real market stylized facts such as fat - tailed returns distribution , clustered volatility , or long range correlations of absolute returns @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we proposed a simple model of financial markets , based on the granovetter threshold model of collective behavior , which is in a good agreement with the above facts .",
    "an inspiration for our work was the bornholdt model @xcite , corresponding to the ising spin model with an additional _ minority term _ , where agents act under the influence of their neighbors ( ising part ) and a global magnetization .",
    "the local field for i - th spin in the bornholdt model is defined as : @xmath0 with a global constant @xmath1 .",
    "the model interprets the price of an asset in terms of the magnetization , which enables the authors to reproduce some stylized facts of financial markets .",
    "here we developed a generalization of the ising spin model that also uses the absolute value of the magnetization as a factor controlling the dynamics .",
    "let us consider a model of n interacting market agents where each agent takes one of three actions : `` buy , '' `` sell , ''",
    "or `` stay inactive . ''",
    "such an agent can be represented by a three - state spin variable @xmath2 taking values @xmath3 when the agent is buying , @xmath4 when the agent is selling , and @xmath5 in the remaining case .",
    "the agents interact with each other according to an interaction matrix @xmath6 . in our model",
    "we assumed the interaction matrix corresponding to a 2-dimensional squared lattice in which each agent interacts only with its four nearest neighbors with an equal strength @xmath7 .",
    "the interaction strength can be _",
    "ferromagnetic _ ( @xmath8 ) when investors try to act like their neighbors or _ antiferromagnetic _",
    "( @xmath9 ) when they try to play against their neighbors .",
    "we chose the ferromagnetic case to introduce the herding behavior .    at each time step",
    "@xmath10 the agent @xmath11 takes its value according to the following formula , @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is a threshold signum function , @xmath14 the function @xmath15 has random values from the gaussian distribution with @xmath5 mean and variance equal to @xmath16 .",
    "the term @xmath17 simulates an individual erratic opinion of the i - th investor and the parameter @xmath18 defines strength of individual opinions .",
    "we define the magnetization of the network , @xmath19 which together with a constant @xmath20 forms a threshold parameter @xmath21 of the sign function .",
    "let us notice that for @xmath22 our model is identical with the 2-valued ising spin model .",
    "we simplified the procedure of price calculation presented in @xcite by omitting the influence of _ chartists _ and _ fundamentalists _ in the population of investors and redefining the price of an asset as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is , in agreement with the efficient market hypothesis @xcite , a geometric brownian walk corresponding to fundamental price changes .",
    "let us put @xmath25 constant for more simplicity .",
    "we got therefore a logarithmic rate of return : @xmath26    according to ( 2 ) , each agent is under the influence of three factors .",
    "the first is an imitation of their neighbors , associated with the matrix @xmath6 which is responsible for the herding behavior .",
    "the second factor is an individual opinion of the agent provided by the term @xmath17 .",
    "so far , it is the standard ising model .",
    "yet , there is one more factor , @xmath27 , which plays the role of a threshold parameter .",
    "only those agents that are able to exceed the threshold are allowed to trade .",
    "the value of the threshold depends on the absolute magnetization . according to ( 5 ) , the magnetization measures a deviation from the fundamental value .",
    "so , when it is large , the agents are afraid of trading , unless they have a strong support from the neighbors or from their private opinions .",
    "using a square @xmath28 lattice of agents with periodic boundary conditions we computed the history of the magnetization , and thus the evolution of the stock price .",
    "the agents were allowed to interact only with their nearest neighbors .",
    "the simulation was started with a random configuration of spins . at each time",
    "step a randomly chosen spin was updated according to the evolution equation ( 2 ) and this was repeated @xmath29 times .",
    "the first @xmath30 time steps were ignored as a period of system thermalization .",
    "we observed that for proper parameters price returns show volatility clustering ( fig . 1 ) and fat tails ( fig .",
    "2 ) .     in time",
    "@xmath10 for parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 and different @xmath20 . ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for real prices , fat tails of returns distribution ( @xmath33 ) are getting slimmer with rising time lag @xmath34 .",
    "finally , the distribution became normal for sufficiently large @xmath34 . in figure 3",
    "we presented the distribution @xmath35 for different @xmath34 .",
    "the tails are slimming down with rising @xmath34 .",
    "the distribution has gaussian tails although its shape is slightly different .",
    "volatility clustering can be quantitatively shown using the autocorrelation function of a time series @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the variance of @xmath36 , and @xmath39 means the average over @xmath10 .",
    "we computed the autocorrelation function of returns @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "4 ) and the absolute value of returns @xmath41 ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "the autocorrelation of returns decays very fast , which is consistent with observations of real markets .",
    "it has also the same shape as the distribution presented in [ 10 ] .",
    "the autocorrelation function of the absolute returns is a slowly decaying exponential similar to the results of [ 13 ] and [ 10 ] .",
    ", obtained for parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath42 . ]    , obtained for parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath42 in log - log scale , and in semi - log scale ( inset ) . ]",
    "we proposed a simple model of financial markets based on the granovetter model .",
    "we introduced a threshold controlled by a magnetization of the system .",
    "this makes an agent take an action only if its confidence is strong enough to overwhelm the threshold .",
    "we defined a logarithmic rate of return as a change of the magnetization .",
    "the model with such a defined price reproduces main stylized facts of financial markets meaning a fat - tailed distribution of returns , volatility clustering , very fast decaying autocorrelation of returns and much slower decay of autocorrelation of absolute returns .",
    "it has been observed for real markets that the distribution of returns @xmath35 becomes gaussian for large @xmath34 .",
    "the distribution of returns generated by our model approaches the gaussian distribution for rising @xmath34 , however its shape differs from the normal distribution .",
    "the autocorrelation function of the absolute returns is a slowly decaying exponential function , while the empirical study of the markets reveals a power - law behavior .",
    "both these issues can be considered as weaker points of our model .",
