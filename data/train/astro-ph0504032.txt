    "the interclump emission is probably a composite of many ages , however , going back to the beginning of pop ii star formation , regardless of the nature of the galaxies in which these stars formed . to find the best interclump star formation histories , we used the galaxy redshifts found from the clump colors and assumed an interclump age corresponding to a beginning of interclump star formation at @xmath5 .",

    "this larger age for the interclump region is not unreasonable considering the redder colors there .",
    "the clumps are characterized by a decaying star formation rate with an e - folding time that has an average @xmath103 gy . thus the clumps are three times older than their e - folding times and should not be considered starbursts .",
    "the fitted e - folding times for star formation in the interclump regions average @xmath13 gy , which is only slightly less than the average interclump age and consistent with a continued build - up of these regions .",
    "extinctions e(b - v ) larger than the rowan - robinson ( 2003 ) values by factors of 2 and 4 for both clump and interclump emission give about the same redshifts for the galaxies .",

    "the average redshift decreases from @xmath104 with our fiducial extinction to 2.2 for both @xmath105 and @xmath106 extinctions .",
    "the higher extinctions decrease the average clump ages from 0.34 gy to 0.23 gy and 0.09 gy , respectively , with @xmath107 and @xmath108 for the two cases , because the source has to be intrinsically bluer when there is additional reddening .",
    "they also make the interclump regions intrinsically bluer by increasing the star formation decay times , @xmath76 , from an average of 1.01 gy to averages of 2.09 gy and 3.30 gy , respectively .",
    "the redshifts allow the determination of the luminosity distance @xmath68 in equation [ eq : bc ] ( carroll , press , & turner 1992 ) . the resulting model apparent magnitudes scaled to the observed apparent magnitudes give the clump masses .",
    "this derivation of mass uses the evolution models in galaxev again , as they give the residual stellar mass per initial solar mass of a population of stars as a function of time . to get the clump mass , we integrated this residual stellar mass over time using the same time - dependent star formation rate as for the integrated spectrum , and then multiplied the resultant model mass by the factor used to scale the model luminosity to the observed clump luminosity .",
    "the interclump mass column densities were obtained from the observed interclump surface brightnesses . to be careful about surface brightness dimming , we first wrote the absolute magnitude of a solar mass of stars from equation [ eq : bc ] using @xmath109 pc .",
    "we then used the cosmological distance modulus ( carroll , press , & turner 1992 ; paper iii ) to give the apparent magnitude for this solar mass and scaled this result to the observed apparent magnitude in a square arcsec .",

    "we got the same result using the @xmath92-dependent luminosity distance @xmath68 in equation [ eq : bc ] .",
    "the total interclump mass was determined by averaging the interclump masses per square arcsec for each galaxy and multiplying this average by the galaxy area in square arcsecs .",
    "this assumes the interclump medium is uniform .",
    "the interclump mass column density is typically larger than the clump mass column density . evidently , the clump light is dominated by the brightest blue stars , while the total mass in the region is dominated by the underlying old stars .",
    "the sum of the clump mass and the interclump mass is taken to be the luminous galaxy mass .",
    "table [ tab : results ] gives the average clump mass , @xmath111 , diameter @xmath112 , and clump mass fraction , @xmath113 in each clump - cluster galaxy , and it gives the luminous galaxy mass , @xmath114 , the galaxy diameter , @xmath115 ( equal to the major axis length out to the 2-@xmath31 contour ) , and the effective rotation speed , @xmath116^{1/2}$ ] ( the factor 5 in the denominator assumes a uniform spherical mass distribution ) .",
    "for the physical sizes , @xmath117 , the angular sizes were used along with the cosmological angle - size relation for the galaxy redshift .    the results in table [ tab : results ] may be summarized as follows .",
    "the objects we have selected are large composite systems with an average luminous mass of @xmath6 m@xmath2 and an average diameter of 19.1 kpc out to the 2@xmath31 contour .",
    "the size and mass are not unprecedented for disk galaxies at redshifts of 2 to 3 ( labb et al . 2003 ; shapley et al 2004 ) . the average rotation speed would be 150 km s@xmath10 if there were regular circular motion , but there are no spectroscopic observations yet . there is a range of a factor of 50 in mass and a factor of 8 in rotation speed , so the peculiar morphology of this galaxy type does not correspond to a particular mass .",
    "the clumps represent an average total mass fraction of 19% , again with a factor of 10 variation . this is smaller than their luminosity fraction mentioned above ( 40% ) because the older interclump medium has a higher mass - to - light ratio than the clumps .",
    "the average interclump mass column density is @xmath118 times larger than the mass column density in solar neighborhood .",
    "the primary reason for the high value is the red color of the interclump stars .",
    "colors this red are matched to stellar populations with high mass - to - light ratios .",
    "increasing the assumed dust abundance by factors of 2 and 4 for both the clumps and the interclump regions hardly changed the redshifts and also changed the clump masses only a little , from an average of @xmath119 m@xmath2 to averages of @xmath120 m@xmath2 and @xmath121 m@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "these small changes reflect the close balance between decreasing @xmath60 ratios for intrinsically bluer stars and increasing @xmath122 corrections for more reddened stars .",
    "the interclump masses and total galaxy masses changed with extinction only a little too : the average total galaxy masses changed from @xmath6 m@xmath2 to @xmath123 m@xmath2 @xmath124 m@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "lower metallicity would also make the intrinsic colors bluer , and this would make the interclump ages older to match the observed colors , producing an even higher @xmath60 .",
    "changes in the stellar initial mass function could lower the inferred interclump mass , but only if the relative abundance of stars younger than @xmath13 gy , corresponding to a - type stars or earlier , is higher in proportion to low mass stars than found locally ; i.e. , the imf has to be relatively flat at intermediate to high mass .    in another series of models",
    ", we assumed the rowan - robinson ( 2003 ) extinction for the models of the clump emission , getting the same clump redshifts and ages as before , but then we assumed higher extinctions in the interclump regions by factors of 2 and 4 before deriving their star formation histories and masses .",
    "these higher interclump extinctions gave intrinsically bluer colors and a greater extinction correction to the magnitudes .",
    "the resultant interclump masses averaged for all 10 galaxies increased from @xmath125 m@xmath2 to @xmath6 m@xmath2 @xmath126 m@xmath2 respectively , as the corresponding lower mass - to - luminosity ratios were more than offset by a higher mass needed to overcome the greater extinction .",
    "other clump properties are in table [ tab : other ] . the clump equivalent atomic density , @xmath127 , is taken to be the ratio of the clump stellar mass to the volume given by the clump diameter , @xmath128 , assuming a mean molecular weight @xmath129 g .",
    "this equivalent density is useful for comparisons with molecular cloud and other gas densities ( see below ) .",
    "the dynamical time is @xmath130 for mass density @xmath131 .",
    "the average and current star formation rates ( sfr ) are given by @xmath132 for clump age @xmath95 and decay time @xmath76 in table [ tab : fits ] .",
    "the internal clump velocity dispersion assumes virial equilibrium with a uniform density : @xmath133^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the last column is the ratio of the clump internal dynamical time to the galaxy dynamical time .",
    "all of these properties are discussed below .",
    "clump - cluster galaxies are a new type of object seen primarily in deep fields such as those surveyed by hst .",
    "they are characterized by : ( 1 ) a disk - like shape ( paper ii ) ; ( 2 ) a significant contribution to the total luminosity ( @xmath36%  table [ tab : prop ] ) from a small number of relatively blue clumps ; ( 3 ) a flat light profile along the major axis ( papers i , ii ) ; ( 4 ) no central red clump or bulge ( papers i , ii ) ; and ( 5 ) a faint , relatively red interclump emission ( this paper ) .",
    "some clump - clusters also have bar - like features ( paper iii ) .",
    "edge - on clump - clusters may be chain galaxies ( paper ii ) .",
    "the lack of clear rotation in chain galaxies ( bunker et al .",
    "2000 ; erb et al .",
    "2004 ) is a mystery if these are normal galaxy disks .    in the few cases studied here",
    ", the clumps are typically @xmath0 gy old in their rest frame and not currently forming stars as fast as they once did .",
    "emission from the interclump medium is dominated by stars that are much older , perhaps up to 2 gy older in some cases .",
    "older and fainter populations inside the clumps could be present but undetected .",
    "with @xmath134% of the luminous mass in a dozen or so giant clumps , these galaxies are unlike modern galaxies where the largest star forming regions are typically @xmath135 of a galaxy s mass .",
    "this difference implies several things .",
    "first , the extreme clumpiness suggests that the rotation curve will not be simple ( immeli et al .",
    "2004a , b ) . the clumps should attract each other and scatter , with their coldest and most dissipative parts migrating to the center to make a bulge and their hottest , least dissipative parts filling the interclump region or thick disk ( noguchi 1999 ; somerville , primack & faber 2001 ; immeli et al .",
    "2004a , b ; hartwick 2004 ; brook et al .",
    "the lack of clear rotation in the few chain galaxies that have been observed may be the result of this severe clump interaction .",
    "second , the clump ages are longer than their dynamical times , so the clumps are self - bound like giant clusters .",
    "the clump density is comparable to the mean galaxy density , however , so tidal forces on the clumps are significant ( this follows from the comparable clump and galaxy dynamical times in table [ tab : other ] ) .",
    "this means that galactic shear and tidal stretching are moderately important for the lowest density clumps .",
    "for example , udf 6462 + 6886 and udf 82 + 99 + 103 have clumps with tails and arcs suggesting the influence of tidal forces .    the fact that the equivalent clump atomic densities are much less than typical molecular cloud densities implies that the clump stars probably formed in numerous dense cores inside kpc - size , gravitationally - bound , low - density cloud complexes .",
    "this hierarchical morphology for star formation is analogous to the case of star complexes found in local spiral galaxies ( efremov 1995 ) , except that for the clump clusters , the clumps are more strongly bound ; local star complexes readily disperse or shear into flocculent spiral arms .",
    "the internal velocity dispersions in the clumps are inferred to be moderately large , 24 km s@xmath10 on average , based on the virial theorem .",
    "this velocity is @xmath136% of the average galactic orbital speed  a high fraction for gas in local spirals but comparable to the fraction in dwarf galaxies . if the clouds that made the young stellar clumps formed by gravitational instabilities ( noguchi 1999 ; immeli et al .",
    "b ) and if they still have the ambient jeans mass , then the velocity dispersion in the pre - cloud gas had to be comparable to the virial velocity in the clumps ( this is based on the usual isothermal assumption ) .",
    "such a high dispersion implies that clump - cluster galaxies are far more turbulent than local galaxies .",
    "one source of turbulence could be major encounters with other galaxies .",
    "tidal forces increase the velocity dispersion considerably in local galaxies undergoing such encounters ( kaufman et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the galaxies in our sample have no major companions now , but the giant clumps in them could have been triggered @xmath0 gy ago at previous encounters , considering the average clump age .",
    "another possible source of turbulence is accretion from the intergalactic medium .",
    "the disk impact speed can be @xmath137 times the circular speed if the gas falls in along cosmological filaments ( keres et al .",
    "this would be @xmath138 km s@xmath10 for our galaxies .",
    "disk turbulence should be slower than this because of energy dissipation , but still enough to explain the high @xmath139 .",
    "supernovae could also be an important source of turbulence as they are in local galaxies , but in clump - cluster galaxies they are likely to be highly concentrated in the clumps , and then they may just cause blow - out rather than widespread turbulence .    in the accretion model , clump - cluster galaxies would have added intergalactic gas at a rate comparable to the average star formation rate , @xmath140 m@xmath2 yr@xmath10 . the disks would presumably have become unstable when the mass column density exceeded a critical value . considering the clump ages , the resulting star formation has a timescale of @xmath0 gy , which is several galactic orbit times .",
    "a different possibility is that the clumps were formerly separate galaxies that accreted during hierarchical buildup ( e.g. , abadi et al . 2003 ; brook et al .",
    "some of our clump clusters are so irregular in morphology ( e.g. , udf 6462 + 6886 ) that they appear more like random conglomerations than circular disks .",
    "also , the lack of clear rotation in the few cases observed suggest highly disturbed dynamics .",
    "this model raises three questions : ( 1 ) can small galaxies like our clumps survive their capture by large galaxies , considering the interclump population that was present before ? ( 2 ) are there examples of bare clumps in the udf that resemble the clumps in our sample ? ( 3 ) would the distribution of axial ratios for coalesced systems be the same as that observed for clump clusters and chain galaxies ?",
    "we attempt to answer these questions here .",
    "the short - term survival of a small galaxy captured by a large galaxy depends mostly on the ratio of densities .",
    "this ratio is important because it is also the ratio of the self - binding force per unit length inside the small galaxy to the tidal disruptive force per unit length exerted by the large galaxy .",
    "if the small galaxy is much denser than the large galaxy , then the small galaxy will survive until it migrates , perhaps because of dynamical friction , to a sufficiently dense region of the large galaxy , at which time it disperses .",
    "the migration time depends on the orbit , and the outer parts of the clump can be shredded continuously as it migrates . in the clump - cluster galaxies studied here , the typical column density of a clump is comparable to the average column density of the interclump population , both being several hundred m@xmath2 pc@xmath32",
    ". the clump density should be considerably higher than the interclump density , however , because the interclump medium is likely to be much thicker than any single clump as a result of stirring from clump motions , dissolution of previous clumps , and stellar migration .",
    "the ratios of axes for these galaxies also suggest fairly thick disks ( paper ii , and see below ) .",
    "in addition , the clumps probably have dense cores like other bound clusters . the clumps are therefore likely to survive their first few impacts with the disk , but probably not much longer .",
    "the observation that the clumps are much older than both their internal dynamical times and the galaxy orbit times ( by a factor of 10 ) implies that most of them live outside the densest regions of the disk .",
    "the exceptions are the clumps with morphologies suggesting tidal disruption , such as the head - tail shapes of the clumps in udf 82 + 99 + 103 , udf 6462 + 6886 , and udf 3034 + 3129 .      what is the evidence for clumps like these outside of clump - cluster galaxies , where they presumably existed before the accretion ?",
    "the udf contains many isolated objects that resemble our clumps in both luminosity and color .",
    "the right - hand side of figure [ fig : udfsmall ] shows color - magnitude and color - color plots of all the udf objects smaller than 6 pixels in fwhm , as given in the tabulation on the udf web site .",
    "this size limit was chosen because it roughly corresponds to the size of a clump in a clump - cluster galaxy .",
    "the left side of the figure shows the magnitudes and colors for the measured clumps in the clump - cluster galaxies of this paper .",
    "the distributions are essentially the same in the regions of overlap",
    ". the udf clumps can be much bluer than our clumps , suggesting either that star formation begins to slow down once a clump is ingested into a larger galaxy , or the clump - cluster sample in our survey has too few clumps to include the rare active ones seen in the general udf field .",
    "there are also much fainter clumps in the udf field than those measured in our survey , but the clump - cluster galaxies have much fainter clumps too which we did not study .",
    "we note that these small objects in the udf field are not the well - studied lyman break galaxies , which tend to be more massive , blue , and luminous than our clumps even at the same @xmath141 ( e.g. , papovich , dickinson , & ferguson 2001 ) .",
    "the small field objects are more the size of the @xmath142 galaxies studied by bunker et al .",
    "most likely , most are low - mass and low - luminosity galaxies in about the same range of redshifts as the clump - cluster galaxies studied here .",
    "the distribution of axial ratios for a random assembly of field clumps might be expected to be significantly different than the distribution for a thick disk .",
    "this distribution was determined for a combined sample of chain and clump - cluster galaxies in paper ii and shown to be similar to the distribution for nearby spiral galaxies ( see also oneil et al . 2000 ; reshetnikov , dettmar , & combes 2003 ) . in general , a thin disk should have a flat distribution for the ratio of minor to major axes , @xmath143 , with a slight rise and then a drop at low ratios where the projected width @xmath144 becomes comparable to the intrinsic disk thickness . a galaxy whose appearance is dominated by a few clumps",
    "will not be very different , in fact .",
    "the first three clumps make a plane regardless of their positions , so the question is how much do the few additional clumps in a clump - cluster or chain galaxy",
    "distort this projected plane ?",
    "figure [ fig : clumps ] shows distribution functions of axial ratios for model galaxies with various numbers of clumps randomly positioned in 3 dimensions .",
    "each line is a histogram from @xmath145 models .",
    "the first three clumps in each model are taken to define a plane and the others are given random positions around the plane in polar coordinates .",
    "the radial distance of each clump is distributed as a gaussian . to simulate variations from different degrees of flattening in a disk , the distance perpendicular to the plane",
    "is multiplied by factors of @xmath146 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , and 1 for the five different lines .",
    "once a clump distribution is chosen , the polar axis of the model is tilted by a random angle whose cosine has a uniform distribution function , simulating random inclinations of the model in the sky .",
    "the axial ratio used for the histogram is then taken to be the minimum ratio of projected width to length , considering all angles in the sky plane .",
    "the resulting histograms peak for axial ratios near unity when @xmath147 and there are a lot of clumps , because then the model galaxy is a uniformly filled sphere .",
    "when the number of clumps is small , the distribution decreases at high axial ratios because the clumps are irregularly positioned even in the spherical case ( @xmath147 ) and some directions happen to have have short sizes .",
    "the distributions decrease at small axial ratio because there are usually some clumps at non - zero perpendicular distance , making @xmath143 non - zero .",
    "the axial ratio where this decrease begins is smaller for more flattened systems because the minimum value of @xmath143 is @xmath148 .    the observed distribution of axial ratios for all of the chains and clump - cluster galaxies in our survey of the udf field ( elmegreen et al . 2005 ) is also shown in figure [ fig : clumps ] .",
    "the solid line is for chains and the dashed line is for clump - clusters , added on top of the solid line .",
    "the observed distribution resembles the models only when there is some intrinsic flattening of the galaxies .",
    "however , the degree of flattening does not have to be large .",
    "the best models are for a number of clumps appropriate to our galaxies , @xmath149 , and for a flattening @xmath150 , which is the second curve from the left ( red in the electronic version ) .",
    "the corresponding intrinsic axial ratio of the model galaxies is the same , @xmath0 , which implies the disks are very thick .",
    "the same conclusion was reached in paper ii .",
    "these considerations suggest that the clumps in some of our clump - cluster galaxies could have been accreted as whole objects from the field .",
    "they would probably survive for the required time , there are isolated field galaxies like them , and the clump - clusters are relatively thick disks .",
    "some energy dissipation perpendicular to the disk had to occur to flatten the clump distribution to the observed axial ratio of 0.1 to 0.3 , but dynamical friction from the observed interclump disk could have done this during the capture process .",
    "this capture scenario is consistent with the model by brook et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who suggest that thick disks in spiral galaxies form quickly , in less than 1 gy , as a result of mergers with a small number of @xmath151 @xmath152 clumps .",
    "hartwick ( 2004 ) also notes the quick formation time of thick disks , and suggests that the pre - galactic clumps which make them could remain today , in part , as disk globular clusters .",
    "a peculiarity of our sample is the high interclump surface density .",
    "if this result is correct , then it implies that the galaxies can not simply age to form present - day spiral disks .",
    "today s disks either have high mass column densities along with massive bulges , or low mass column densities without prominent bulges",
    ". they do not have high mass column densities and no bulges , like our clump - clusters .",
    "one possibility is that a large fraction of the mass in clump - cluster disks will migrate inward to form a bulge .",
    "this migration would be accompanied by outward angular momentum transfer , and might result from spiral waves or repeated interactions , with bar formation a possible intermediate step .",
    "another possibility is that clump - cluster galaxies merge to form elliptical galaxies .",
    "the likelihood of this is high considering their relatively large sizes and high redshifts where interactions are still frequent .",

    "<S> the distribution of axial ratios for the combined population of chain and clump - cluster galaxies in the udf is compared with models and shown to be consistent with a thick disk geometry . </S>",
    "<S> if these galaxies evolve into today s disk galaxies , then we are observing a stage where accretion and star formation are extremely clumpy and the resulting high velocity dispersions form thick - disks . </S>",
    "<S> several clump - clusters have disk densities that are much larger than in local disks , however , suggesting an alternate model where they do not survive until today , but get converted into ellipticals by collisions . </S>"
