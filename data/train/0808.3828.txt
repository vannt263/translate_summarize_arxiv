    "the appearance of radar / laser gauging techniques and spacecraft ranging has enabled us to measure the distance from the earth to other inner planets and the moon directly and precisely .",
    "recent years , these techniques have been drastically improved , for instance , the planetary radar measurement achieves the observational accuracy of the interplanetary distance within a few 100 [ m ] , the spacecraft ranging a few [ m ] and the lunar laser ranging a few [ cm ] . in these observations ,",
    "the round - trip time of light / signal is measured by the atomic clocks on the earth .",
    "nowadays , the advent of laser cooled atomic clocks has led to the improvement of realization of si second and it is expected that this advance will go on . therefore the arrival time measurement is the most accurate observation among the all kinds of astronomical and astrophysical ones .    due to the improvement of these techniques",
    ", it is important to develop the rigorous light propagation model which contains the various general relativistic and relating effects , and this subject is actively investigated by many authors , e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "these theoretical developments also play a crucial role in testing the gravitational theories @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "an arrival time measurements have also devoted to the improvement of lunar and planetary ephemerides , such as de @xcite , epm @xcite , vsop @xcite , and inpop @xcite , and the determination of astronomical constants . especially among these constants , the astronomical unit ( of length )",
    "au is one of the fundamental and important one which gives the relation of length units ; [ au ] of astronomical system of units and [ m ] of si ones .",
    "au is currently determined from the arrival time measurement data of planetary radar and spacecraft ranging within the accuracy of 0.1 [ m ] or 12 digits level as @xmath1 = 1.495978706960 \\times 10^{11 } \\pm 0.1   ~[{\\rm m}]$ ] @xcite .",
    "therefore from the point of view of the fundamental astronomy , the development of a accurate light propagation model is of great importance .    until now",
    ", the light propagation formulae have been derived in terms of the post - newtonian approximation , @xmath2 in which the background metric @xmath3 is the static minkowski one .",
    "however , it is interesting to examine the influence of cosmological expansion on the light / signal propagation since the accuracy of astronomical observation is rapidly growing . of course",
    ", it is presently hard to observe such a influence in the solar system experiments .",
    "nevertheless , the progress of these or relating measurement techniques may enable to detect its trace in the future date .    in this paper , we will study the light propagation passing near the massive star as the sun which is embedded in the cosmological expanding background .",
    "we will adopt the robertson - mcvittie spacetime introduced in section [ rm - metric ] , and concentrate on the gravitational time delay and derive the extra delay due to the effect of cosmological expansion with respect to the standard formula by shapiro in section [ time - delay ] .",
    "further in order to relate with the actual observation and its reduction process , we will take account of the time transformations in section [ tt ] ; from coordinate time to proper one in subsection [ ctp ] , and conversely , from proper time to coordinate one in subsection [ ptc ] . as the application of results",
    ", we will consider the problem of increase of astronomical unit recently reported by @xcite in section [ au ] .",
    "the standard form of robertson - mcvittie metric is given by @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gravitational constant , @xmath6 is the mass of central body , @xmath7 is the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath8 is a scale factor .",
    "( [ mcvittie ] ) is regarded as the spacetime around the point mass singularity embedded in the flrw background metric , and coincides thoroughly with the schwarzschild solution in the isotropic coordinate when @xmath9 , and the flrw model for curvature parameter @xmath10 when @xmath11 .",
    "however , recent dynamical model of planetary motion ( eih equation of motion ) , the various light propagation models cited in the previous section and other observational models in the solar system are formulated not in the comoving coordinate system as ( [ mcvittie ] ) but in the barycentric celestial reference system ( bcrs ) or corresponding to bcrs based on the post - newtonian framework @xcite . and",
    "the various astronomical constants are also derived in bcrs or corresponding to bcrs ; for example the secular increase of au , @xmath12 that we discuss in section [ au ] is evaluated based on barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) @xcite . therefore in order to discuss these effects and cosmological one in the same framework as far as possible , it seems to be more adequate to take the reference system as close as possible to bcrs .",
    "hence we adopt the following radial transformation and convert ( [ mcvittie ] ) into the nearly proper coordinate system @xcite , @xmath13 we notice that the matching of bcrs and cosmological reference system is important problem in the fundamental astronomy and this issue is discussed by @xcite . using ( [ radial - transform ] ) , ( [ mcvittie ] ) is rewritten as , @xmath14 here @xmath15 is a hubble parameter and the overdot denotes the time derivative . if @xmath16 does not change , namely , the hubble constant at present , @xmath17 [ 1/s ] , @xmath18 , then we can introduce the time transformation to remove @xmath19 term in ( [ mcvittie-2 ] ) @xcite , @xmath20 in a practical sense , the hubble parameter @xmath16 varies with time .",
    "nonetheless , when focusing on the solar system experiments , the actual round - trip time of light / signal and the time interval in which the observational data is stored are much shorter , at most @xmath21 [ yr ] , than the age of universe , @xmath22 [ yr ] .",
    "thus , let us assume @xmath16 changes adiabatically as , @xmath23 it is suited to put , @xmath24  [ 1/(s @xmath25 yr ) ] , hence , it follows , @xmath26 } \\sim 10^{-22 } ~~[1/{\\rm s } ] .",

    "we note that the assumption @xmath33 leads robertson - mcvittie solution to schwarzschild - de sitter model , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "as a consequence , although our metric ( [ base - metric ] ) is equivalent to schwarzschild - de sitter model , we will begin with this metric as the first attempt of our investigation .",

    "in this section , let us apply above results to the increase of astronomical unit recently reported by krasinsky and brumberg ( 2004 ) @xcite .",
    "they found that from the analysis of high precision planetary radar and martian spacecraft ranging data ( the arrival time measurement ) , the astronomical unit of length au increases with respect to meters as @xmath0 [ m / century ] .",
    "this reported values is about 100 times larger than the present determination error of au , see @xcite and section [ intro ] in this paper .",
    "the similar variation of au is also corroborated by @xcite .    before entering the au issue",
    ", we briefly summarize how the au is derived from the analysis of observational data .",

    "practically this step looks around the various effects , e.g. the relativity , the solar corona , and the troposphere , see 5.32 of @xcite",
    ". therefore the light propagation model plays a key role in deriving the au .",
    "we also note that @xmath73 depends on a constellation of astronomical constants and parameters via the equation of motion and some other relations .",
    "then au is optimized and derived with other parameters simultaneously by the least square method , as satisfying @xmath78 .",
    "however , when krasinsky and brumberg rewrote @xmath75 as , @xmath79 and fit to observational data , they discovered @xmath12 is non - zero and positive value @xmath80 [ m / century ] , where @xmath81 is the time interval counted off from some initial epoch .",
    "notice that estimated @xmath12 does not mean the expansion of planetary orbit and/or the increasing of orbital period of planet . according to krasinsky @xcite",
    ", the observations do not show any traces of such kinds .",
    "further the determination error of inner planetary orbits in the latest planetary ephemerides is also smaller than the observed @xmath80 [ m / century ] , see e.g. table 4 of @xcite .",
    "therefore the observed @xmath12 may relate with not the dynamical aspect of planetary motion but the light / signal propagation .",
    "therefore , let us examine if the extra time delay derived in previous sections can explain the observed @xmath12 .",
    "we first apply ( [ dtau ] ) and evaluate the earth - mars ranging concretely .",
    "we suppose the earth ( @xmath82 ) and the mars ( @xmath83 ) move along the circular orbit of radius , @xmath84 [ m ] ( 1 [ au ] ) and @xmath85 [ m ] ( 1.52 [ au ] ) , respectively .     measured in the proper time of observer on the earth .",

    "the figure is plotted as the function of relative angle between the mars @xmath87 and the earth @xmath88 , @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "the order of @xmath86 is at most about @xmath91 [ s ] which is considered as the typical magnitude of @xmath86 for the planetary radar and the spacecraft ranging . here",
    "let us evaluated the order of magnitude of each part in ( [ dtau ] ) ; the leading terms @xmath92 , the coupling terms @xmath93 , and @xmath94 where we took @xmath95 of earth as @xmath96 .",
    "however , it is much smaller than the current measurement limit , that is , the internal error of atomic clocks , @xmath97 [ s ] .",
    "next , we calculate ( [ tauh2 ] ) presuming again the earth moving along the circular orbit , @xmath98 $ ] . the difference between the coordinate time and",
    "the proper one caused by the cosmological expansion is , in the interval of 100 [ yr ] , @xmath99}.    \\label{tauh3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is also much smaller than the relative error of atomic clocks , @xmath97 [ s ] .",
    "@xmath69 causes the apparent orbital variations of longitude @xmath100 of planet , but it is @xmath101 [ rad ] where @xmath102 [ rad / s ] is the mean motion of earth .",
    "then @xmath69 does not has much effect on the observed @xmath12 . rounding up the results , the effect of cosmological expansion on the light propagation dose not give the explanation of observed increase of au in the current solar system experiments .",
    "here we mention the attempts of krasinsky and brumberg ( 2004 ) .",
    "they also investigated the secular increase of au in terms of cosmological expansion deriving the approximate metric of einstein equation , ( 5 ) of @xcite which is the modified version of the standard form of robertson - mcvittie metric ( [ mcvittie ] ) . ) with respect to @xmath103 , replacing the time coordinate @xmath104 and @xmath105 , see appendix a of @xcite .",
    "] in such a comoving form , they examined both the planetary motion and light propagation , then found there exist the large orbital variations in the radial and longitudinal directions due to the cosmological expansion ( ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) of @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "however , these dynamical perturbations are completely canceled out by the time transformation between the coordinate time and proper one relating with light / signal propagation ( ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) of @xcite , respectively ) . hence they concluded that the cosmological effect can not account for the observed @xmath12 .    before closing this section",
    ", we shortly note the dynamical effect due to the cosmological terms in the planetary motion .",
    "this problem has been studied by many authors @xcite . and",
    "they showed that the cosmological influence on the planetary dynamics , e.g. the additional perihelion advance , is negligible small .",
    "we also confirmed that the cosmological terms are too small to give an account of the increasing of au . in appendix [ append - a ]",
    ", we briefly summarize the results of the cosmological effect on the planetary motion based on ( [ base - metric ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the light propagation passing near the gravitating body as the sun embedded in the cosmological spacetime by means of the robertson - mcvittie solution .",
    "we concentrated on the time delay and derived the correction terms with respect to the shapiro s formula .",
    "we also took account of the time transformations ; coordinate time to proper one , and conversely , proper time to coordinate one .",
    "these treatments are of importance when dealing with the observed round - trip time and its reduction process .    as the application of results , we considered the problem of increase of astronomical unit reported by krasinsky and brumberg ( 2004 ) , since the au is currently derived from the analysis of the round - trip time of light / signal .",
    "however , the effect of the cosmological expansion is too small to produce the observed @xmath80 [ m / century ] and then it dose not give the explanation of increase of au .    here",
    "it is worth to mention the interpretation of @xmath12 .",
    "although we and krasinsky and brumberg ( 2004 ) investigated the secular increasing of astronomical unit in terms of the cosmological effect , another possibility is suggested , that is , increasing of au is arisen due to the lack of the calibrations of internal delays of the radio signals within the spacecrafts and this may be the most plausible reason of observed @xmath12 .",
    "nonetheless , till now , the origin of @xmath12 is far from clear therefore this issue should be explored by means of the every possibility we can imagine . and the re - analysis of @xmath12 using new data sets is also expected .",
    "as we mentioned in the end of section [ au ] , so far , the dynamical terms due to cosmological expansion in the planetary dynamics has been studied actively , while the influence on light / signal propagation has hardly been examined . however , the accuracy of astronomical / astrophysical observations , especially the optical , radio and arrival time ones , rapidly increases in the solar system and they may make it necessary to incorporate the cosmological effect in the future date . for this purpose ,",
    "our investigation in present paper is the first attempt to this direction . to consider this problem , the matching of bcrs and cosmological reference system discussed by @xcite is also important issue to be investigated .",
    "( [ base - metric ] ) expresses the completely static gravitational field , and is equivalent to schwarzschild - de sitter model .",
    "nevertheless , as long as we focus on the solar system experiments , our results may be regarded as the dominant effects due to the cosmological expansion , see in ( [ hubble_0 ] ) .",
    "however in order to study the cosmological influence on the light / signal propagation in more detail and general cases , we must treat @xmath16 and/or @xmath8 as a function of time and adopt the time dependent spacetime model .",
    "this subject will be investigated at some future time .",
