    "the present effort deals with the macroscopic description of a toy model with a great conceptual significance : the called hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model @xcite . despite the hmf model is enough amenable for allowing an accurate numerical and analytical characterization , it exhibits many features observed in more realistic long - range interacting systems such as : violent relaxation , persistence of metastable states , slow collisional relaxation , phase transition , anomalous diffusion , etc @xcite .",
    "this reason explains why the present system is considered as a paradigmatic toy model in the understanding of the thermodynamical and dynamical properties of the real long - range interacting systems @xcite .",

    "as expected , we begin to address the equilibrium thermodynamical properties of this model system by using the microcanonical description .",

    "the using of an appropriate _ n_-dependence in the coupling constant @xmath2 is usually identified with the _ kac prescription _ @xcite .",
    "the standard usage of this procedure is to consider certain dependence @xmath224 that ensures the _ extensive growing _ of the total energy @xmath225 , since the energy per particle @xmath226 @xmath227 is keep fixed in the thermodynamic limit @xmath228 .",
    "this condition demands that @xmath229 .",
    "although most of works devoted to the hmf model make use of this condition @xcite , it is very easy to verify that its application does not avoid the divergence of the entropy per particle in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath230 .    a closer look to this question",
    "clarifies that this procedure should be applied with care .",
    "firstly , the coupling constants determine the characteristic temporal scales acting on the dynamical evolution of a given system , and therefore , any scaling _",
    "n_-dependence of these coupling constant affects the system dynamical behavior during the imposition of the thermodynamic limit @xmath228 .",
    "this obvious remark is very important to take into consideration since the results of many numerical simulations evidence the _ noncommutativity _ of the thermodynamic limit @xmath228 with the infinite time limit @xmath231 necessary for the equilibration of temporal averages @xcite : @xmath232 ( where @xmath233   dt / t$ ] ) as a consequence of the divergence of the relaxation time @xmath234 in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath235 . in the authors opinion ,",
    "the origin of this anomaly could be related to an inappropriate use of the kac prescription .",
    "this argument follows from questioning the main motivation of introducing the kac prescription : to deal with an extensive energy .",
    "the extensivity of the energy is a thermodynamic feature of the extensive systems intimately related to the statistical independence or separability of a large system in independent subsystems appearing as a consequence of the incidence of short - range forces .",
    "obviously , such a microscopic picture is outside the context within the hmf model , where the long - range character of the microscopic interactions implies its _ intrinsic nonextensive nature_.    the hmf model could be consider as a limit case with @xmath236 of a parametric family of ferromagnetic models on a square lattice @xcite whose potential energy is given by : @xmath237   , \\ ] ] where @xmath238 is the lattice distance between the i - th and j - th rotator . the integral estimation of potential energy per particle in the paramagnetic phase ( where the averages @xmath239 ) by using a lattice with spacing @xmath240 and linear dimension @xmath241 @xmath242:@xmath243{cc}% \\left (   \\alpha-2\\right )   ^{-1}\\left (   a^{2-\\alpha}-r^{2-\\alpha}\\right )    & \\alpha\\not = 2\\\\ \\ln\\left (   r / a\\right )    & \\alpha=2 \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] allows to understand that such as models are extensive in the thermodynamic limit when @xmath244 and nonextensive elsewhere . as a consequence of the existence of long - range correlations",
    ", the nonextensive system can not be  trivially divided in independent subsystems , and therefore , there is no physical reason to justify the imposition of the extensive character of the total energy in this case .",
    "the using a suitable scaling dependence for the coupling constants in order to regularize the thermodynamic parameters and potentials of a given system in the thermodynamic limit might be applicable in some way that also ensures a well - defined dynamical behavior characterized by the commutativity of the limits @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "generally speaking , all that it is necessary to demand is the non divergence of the relaxation timescale @xmath234 when @xmath228 . with some recent exceptions @xcite",
    ", most of numerical studies of the microscopic dynamics of the hmf model revealed a characteristic relaxation timescale for the hmf model given by @xmath247 , being @xmath248 the characteristic microscopic time of the rotators evolution  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to realize that the imposition of the scaling @xmath249 ensures both the well - defined behavior of the additive constant of the entropy per particle @xmath221 and the relaxation timescale @xmath250 when @xmath228 .",
    "this ansatz leads to a power - low growing of the characteristic energy @xmath251 , which does not involves in principle any physical inconsistency since the hmf model is nonextensive .",
    "we shall return to this discussion in the forthcoming papers .",
    "we perform the power expansion up to the second order approximation of @xmath252 for the complex number @xmath253 : @xmath254 being @xmath33 and @xmath255 .",

    "the integration of the expression ( [ expk ] ) leads to the result shown in eq.([func ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the first - order approximation of the correlation functions involves a little refinement of the steepest descend method .",
    "the aim is the determination of the @xmath145-contributions of the average of a physical quantity @xmath273 as follows : @xmath274   d^{n}\\mathbf{x , } \\label{a11}%\\ ] ] where the partition function @xmath8 is given by:@xmath275",

    "for example , the term @xmath281 represents the tensorial product : @xmath282    eq.([power1 ] ) allows to express the exponential function as follows : @xmath283   = \\exp\\left [   ns\\left ( \\mathbf{x}_{0}\\right )   \\right ]   \\exp\\left [   -\\frac{1}{2}\\omega\\cdot\\left ( \\delta\\mathbf{x}\\right )   ^{2}\\right ]   f\\left (   \\delta\\mathbf{x};\\mathbf{x}% _ { 0}\\right )   , \\ ] ] where @xmath284 and the function @xmath285   $ ] is given by:@xmath286 this latter result can be conveniently rewritten as a power series expansion:@xmath287 where@xmath288 being @xmath289 an integer function defined by:@xmath290{cc}% 1 & n=0\\\\ 0 & n\\not = 0 \\end{array } \\right .   .\\",
