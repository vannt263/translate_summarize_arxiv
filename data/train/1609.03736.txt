    "the kibble - urek ( kz ) mechanism refers to the dynamics of spontaneous symmetry breaking which takes place near a non - adiabatic second order phase transition .",
    "when the system approaches a critical point , the correlation length can no longer adiabatically follow its diverging equilibrium value . consequently",
    ", at the critical point the transition occurs without correlation length having reached the size of the whole system . as a result ,",
    "finite - sized phase domains are formed , which display independent choices of the symmetry breaking order parameter .",
    "the kz physics have been intensively studied experimentally in a wide range of systems including experiments in atomic bose - einstein condensates @xcite which indeed provide the ability of adapting and tuning the system parameters with an exceptional level of control .",
    "the kz theory predicts a universal scaling law for an average domain size in terms of critical exponents characteristic for a universality class of the system .",
    "a simple theoretical framework is based on the adiabatic - impulse - adiabatic approximation and does not take into account specific processes which can lead to the change of the scaling exponent .",
    "this is the case for the system studied in this paper .",
    "we consider the quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a phase - separated state by increasing an external magnetic field . in our previous work @xcite",
    "we demonstrated the modification of the kz mechanism due to conservation of a magnetization in the system .",
    "initially , the quantum phase transition develops in usual way . the number of spin domain seeds that appear is well described by the kz theory .",
    "the modification takes place during the growth of spin domain seeds into stable spin domains .",
    "only some of the domain seeds develop into stable domains because of the conservation of magnetization , which determines the volume fraction of the new phase and limits the density of spin domains .",
    "this so called post - selection process results in the second scaling law with a different exponent for the number of domains in the final stable configuration .    in this paper",
    "we extend our further analysis by considering the effect of an external harmonic trapping potential on an outcome of the quantum phase transition in this system .",
    "we find that the inhomogeneity , arising as a result of the external trapping potential , brings in new physics . due to the spatial dependence of the critical magnetic field , different parts of the system undergo phase transition at different times .",
    "the transition starts in the trap center , and formation of spin domains is governed by causality .",
    "previously , it was shown that in trapped systems the exponents in the kz theory are modified by the finite velocity of the phase transittion front  @xcite .",
    "when the front of the transition moves faster than the characteristic velocity of perturbation , domains nucleate ; otherwise the choice of the order parameter in the broken symmetry phase is done homogeneously across the system .",
    "the causality introduces a characteristic length scale of the region in which domains can nucleate , and sets values of the scaling exponents .",
    "we show that the outcome of the quantum phase transition in our system can not be explained by the causality alone .",
    "in addition to the causality effect , a process of transport of local magnetization from the trap center to its remote parts occurs , leading to a new characteristic length scale , namely the size of the low - magnetization region in the trap center in which domains can nucleate .",
    "the new length scale depends on the quench rate , introducing further modifications of the two scaling exponents .",
    "we explain the corresponding scaling laws by considering a slow diffusive - drift relaxation process , obtaining excellent agreement in a wide range of quench times .",

    "the spin - independent and spin - dependent interaction coefficients are given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the s - wave scattering length for colliding atoms with total spin @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the frequency of a transverse potential .",
    "both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are positive , ensuring the antiferromagnetic ground state @xcite . in the following analytic calculations we often assume the incompressible regime where @xmath18 , which is satisfied by e.g. a @xmath19na spin-1 condensate .",
    "the total atom number @xmath20 and the magnetization @xmath21 are conserved quantities .",
    "the linear part of the zeeman shifts @xmath22 induces homogeneous rotation of the spin vector around the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "since the hamiltonian is invariant with respect to such spin rotations , we consider only the effects of the quadratic zeeman shift  @xcite . for sufficiently weak magnetic field we can approximate it by a positive energy shift of the @xmath23 sublevels @xmath24 , where @xmath0 is the magnetic field strength and @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the gyromagnetic ratios of the electron and nucleus",

    "we show examples of the time evolution of the averaged local magnetization .",
    "now , we make the central assumption that the transport of local magnetization is a slow diffusive - drift relaxation process .",
