    "when a thin normal layer separates two superconductors , the superconducting coherence can spread across the normal region .",
    "the ( dc and ac ) josephson effects are typical manifestations of such phenomena.@xcite the rise of mesoscopic physics leads to reconsideration of these effects in systems where the normal region consists of narrow channels with quantized transverse modes ( quantum point contacts ) . typically the superconductors are connected via quantum point contacts which can be constrictions in semiconductor heterostructures@xcite or atomic contacts in break junctions.@xcite one of the insights gained from these studies is the important role of the andreev bound - states in the josephson effects.@xcite    when a particle ( hole ) incident from a normal metal into a superconductor ( or vice versa ) , besides normal reflections , the particle ( hole ) can be retro - reflected along its incident path and converted into a hole ( particle ) .",
    "this is called the andreev reflection . in superconductor  normal - metal  superconductor junctions , particles ( and likewise for holes ) can be reflected by the two ns interfaces repeatedly and form bound states in the normal region , which are the andreev bound - states . for each transmission channel",

    "the dynamics of andreev bound - states play a key role in the ac effects .",
    "since for unequal gap junctions the andreev bound - states can be missing for some ranges of phase difference,@xcite it is therefore of interest to investigate its consequence in the ac effect .",

    "we will then study in detail the low bias regime where inelastic scattering rate is vanishingly small ( compared with the bias voltage and the gap amplitudes).@xcite under this situation , similar to the dc effects in unequal - gap junctions,@xcite the current receives contributions from both the andreev bound - states and the continuum states ( see fig .  [ schm ] ) .",
    "we shall show that in this limit the current - voltage characteristics can be understood from the current - phase relation provided the different behaviors of the bound states and the continuum states are taken into account .",
    "for unequal gap configurations , where the andreev bound - states are missing for some ranges of phase difference , the continuum states give rise to non - zero sine components .",

    "the supercurrent is carried entirely by the andreev bound - states .",
    "for unequal gap junctions , however , apart from the bound states , the continuum states ( @xmath69 ) can also contribute to the current.@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ iphi](a)(b ) , the continuum contributions behave the same under zero and finite bias . in particular , the continuum contribution is always odd with respective to @xmath70 . for the bound - state contributions , however , the situation is quite different , as we shall now explain .",
    "the two branches of the andreev bound - states carry supercurrent in opposite directions and only one of them can be occupied ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ iphi](a ) ) . in equilibrium , since the chemical potential lies in the middle of the energy gap ( @xmath71 ) , it is always the lower branch that is occupied .",
    "therefore in this case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ iphi](a ) , the bound - state contribution always switches branch when the superconducting phase @xmath68 goes across @xmath72.@xcite in the presence of finite bias , however , since the phase evolves according to the josephson relation ( @xmath73 ) , the bound - state current always follows a single branch of the bound - state spectra , so that the corresponding current contribution remains the same sign during one period.@xcite figure [ iphi](b ) shows the low - bias effective current - phase relation for ballistic junctions with gap ratio @xmath60 .",
    "since there is no branch switching , the bound - state current stays positive and is even with respect to @xmath70 . on the other hand , due to the finite gap for the continuum states , their contributions",

    "[ iphi](b ) for ballistic junctions at different gap ratios .",
    "one can observe that they match well with each other .",

    "this result thus confirms that the picture obtained in ref .   can be extended to unequal gap junctions .",
    "also , it illustrates the importance of continuum - state contributions to the ac current components in unequal gap junctions .    finally , we study the temperature dependence of the dc component for ballistic junctions in the low bias limit . in the equal gap case ,",
    "it was shown by averin and bardas@xcite that in the low bias limit , the current receives major contributions from the neighborhood ( @xmath75 ) of the gap edges .",
    "this is because particles and holes with incident energies in these ranges can undergo divergent numbers of andreev reflections ( of order @xmath76 ) which generate dominant contributions to the current .",
    "therefore , it follows that the temperature dependence of the current is determined by the occupation factor near the gap edge .",

    "[ density_plot ] the current density @xmath85 for the dc component at small bias for @xmath1 .",
    "it is clearly seen that the current density has a sharp peak near the smaller gap @xmath5 .",

    "( [ i_density ] ) , one concludes easily that the temperature dependence of the dc component is determined from the quasiparticle occupation near the _ smaller gap_. this",
    "is confirmed by the plot shown in fig .",
    "[ temp_dep ] , where it is seen that the result fits well with the expression @xmath86 .",
    "indeed the reason for the sharp peak near the smaller gap is very similar to its equal gap counterpart .",
    "namely , at low bias , excitations near the smaller gap are being injected into the point contact and `` become '' the andreev bound state : they undergo a divergent number of andreev reflections for @xmath87 . for particles and holes with incident energies between the smaller and larger gaps , they are only partially andreev reflected and hence contribute insignificantly to the current as @xmath88 .",
    "the presence of finite reflection can reduce the current density near the smaller gap significantly ; this is illustrated in inset ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ density_plot ] . also , when the bias increases , the peak at the smaller gap broadens ( see inset ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ density_plot ] ) and the current receives contributions from a wider range of energies . eventually , when the bias is large the picture described above becomes no longer valid .    in closing this section ,",
    "we would like to point out an interesting feature which appears in the plots for the current densities . as can be seen clearly from insets ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ density_plot ] , there are regular steps ( or shoulders ) in the current density profiles which are separated by @xmath39 .",
    "indeed these steps are consequences of the change in the number of andreev reflections when varying the energy of the incident particles .",

    ", we also find that the temperature dependence of the dc component is determined by the occupation factor at the smaller gap .",
    "these results confirm that the picture obtained by averin and bardas@xcite can be generalized to the case of asymmetric junctions .    finally , to test our results for the non - vanishing sine component for unequal gap junctions , it is necessary to measure the current component @xmath57 experimentally .",
    "as suggested by hurd _",
    "et al._,@xcite this may be achieved by using a proper phase - biasing network . moreover , in the presence of a microwave radiation , it may also have consequences on the subharmonic shapiro steps.@xcite an interesting issue which is not addressed in this article is the change in the non - equilibrium noise ( shot noise ) when the andreev bound - states are missing in asymmetric junctions .",
