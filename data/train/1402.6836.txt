    "statistical inference on random variables comprises estimation and testing procedures that allow one to characterize the underlying distribution , regardless the variables nature and/or dimension .",

[ gofdens : tab : results : short ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the delicate issue of the bandwidth choice for the testing procedure has been approached as follows . in the simulation results presented in section [ gofdens : sec : sim ] , a fixed pair of bandwidths has been chosen based on a likelihood cross validation criterion . ideally , one would like to run the test in a grid of several bandwidths to check how the test is affected by the bandwidth choice .",
    "this has been done for six circular - linear and circular - circular models , as shown in figure [ gofdens : fig : band : ext ] .",
    "specifically , figure [ gofdens : fig : band : ext ] shows percentages of rejections under the null ( @xmath215 , green ) and under the alternative ( @xmath216 , orange ) , computed from @xmath217 monte carlo samples for each pair of bandwidths ( the same collection of samples for each pair ) on a logarithmic spaced @xmath218 grid .",
    "the sample size considered is @xmath219 and the number of bootstrap replicates is @xmath220 . + as it can be seen , the test is correctly calibrated regardless the bandwidths value .",
    "in fact , for all the models explored , the rejection rates for each pair of bandwidths in the grid are inside the @xmath221 confidence interval of the proportion @xmath214 ( this happens for @xmath222 of the bandwidths in the grid ) . however , the power is notably affected by the choice of the bandwidths , with rather different behaviours depending on the model and on the alternative .",
    "reasonable choices of the bandwidths based on an estimation criterion such as the one obtained by the median of the lcv bandwidths ( [ gofdens : band : lcv ] ) lead in general to a competitive power .",
    "tables [ gofdens : tab : results : cl : ext ] and [ gofdens : tab : results : cc : ext ] collect the results of the simulation study for each combination of model ( cl or cc ) , deviation ( @xmath223 ) , sample size ( @xmath224 ) and significance level ( @xmath225 ) . when the null hypothesis holds , the level of the test is correctly attained for all significance levels , sample sizes and models . under the alternative ,",
    "the tests perform satisfactorily , having both of them a quick detection of the alternative when only a @xmath226 and a @xmath227 of the data come from a density not belonging to the null parametric family .",

    "the graphs shows that there are no evidences against the model of @xcite for modelling the wildfires data and that the model used to describe the proteins dataset is not adequate .",
    "this model employs the copula structure of @xcite with marginals and link function given by circular densities based on nnts , specifying @xcite that the best fit in terms of bic arises from considering three components for the nnts s in the marginals and two for the link function .",
    "the fitting of the nnts densities was performed using the ` nntsmanifoldnewtonestimation ` function of the package ` circnntsr ` @xcite , which computes the mle of the nnts parameters using a newton algorithm on the hypersphere . the two - step ml procedure described in section [ gofdens : su : simus ]",
    "was employed to fit first the marginals and then the copula .",
    "the resulting contour levels of the parametric estimate are quite similar to the ones shown in figure 5 of @xcite .",
