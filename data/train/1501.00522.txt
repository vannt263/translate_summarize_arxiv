    "in new versions of the review of particle physics ( pdg ) after the year 2012  @xcite , there are four @xmath4 states , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath3 and @xmath9 .",
    "the two - star state @xmath10 in previous versions has been split into a three - star @xmath3 and a two - star @xmath9 based on the evidence from bnga analysis  @xcite .",
    "usually the @xmath7 and the @xmath8 are assigned to states with orbital angular momentum @xmath11 in quark model , and mixing effect is very important to explain the decay pattern of these states  @xcite .",
    "the situation for the internal structures of two @xmath4 states with higher mass , the @xmath3 and the @xmath9 , is much less unclear . in quark model ,",
    "the @xmath3 and the @xmath9 are in the mass region of @xmath12 band states of which the masses and decay patterns were predicted  @xcite",
    ". however , the explicit correspondence between predicted and observed states is unclear . in large @xmath13 qcd ,",
    "the third and fourth @xmath4 states have masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "klempt and others claimed that the @xmath3 is the missing third @xmath16 state in mass region @xmath17 mev with orbit angular momentum @xmath11 and radial excitation number @xmath18  @xcite , which is also supported by the ads / qcd  @xcite .",
    "their conclusion is only based on a comparison between predicted and observed masses . as enlightened by isgur , `` in a complex system like the baryon resonances ,",
    "predicting the spectrum of states is not a very stringent test of a model ''  @xcite .",
    "decay pattern provides more information about hadron internal structure .",
    "many analyses suggested that a @xmath4 state with mass about 2.1 gev is essential to explain experimental results  @xcite . before the year 2012",
    ", it is related to the only @xmath4 state listed in the pdg with mass higher than 1.8 gev , the @xmath10 , and explained as the third state @xmath19_3 $ ] predicted in the constituent quark model . for example , the @xmath10 is found to play the most important role in the photoproduction of @xmath1 off proton target  @xcite .",
    "recently , the clas collaboration at jefferson national accelerator facility released their exclusive photoproduction cross section for the @xmath20(1520 ) for energies from near threshold up to a center of mass energy @xmath21 of 2.85 gev with large range of the @xmath6 production angle  @xcite .",
    "the reanalyses about the new data in refs .",
    "@xcite confirmed the previous conclusion that a nucleon resonance near 2.1 gev , @xmath9 , is essential to reproduce the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "in the following it will be shown why the @xmath9 should be assigned to the third state @xmath19_3 $ ] in the constituent quark model in line with the theoretical framework in ref .",
    "there are five @xmath4 states in @xmath12 band , of which the radiative and @xmath22 decay amplitudes were predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite as listed in table .",
    "[ tab : resonances ] .    .the",
    "@xmath4 nucleon resonances and their decay amplitudes predicted in the relativistic quark model  @xcite .",
    "the mass @xmath23 , helicity amplitudes @xmath24 and partial wave decay amplitudes @xmath25 are in the unit of mev , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     only one bound state solution with @xmath28 and @xmath0 is found from the interaction of @xmath29 and @xmath6 .",
    "the decay width becomes larger with increase of the binding energy .",
    "it is understandable because the large binding energy means that the distance between two constituents is smaller so that the quark exchange is prone to happen in the bound state .",
    "compared with the pdg and bnga values about mass and total width , the best cut off @xmath30 gev is reasonable and consentient to the value in the literature  @xcite",
    ". the branch ratios of @xmath3 are stable compared with binding energy . the @xmath31 channel is the most important decay channel , about @xmath32 , which is consistent with the pdg suggested values @xmath33 and @xmath34 from the bnga analysis .",
    "the main decay channel of the @xmath19_3 $ ] predicted in the constituent quark model is @xmath35 which is much larger than other decay channels .",
    "it conflict with both the values suggested by the pdg and these obtained by the bnga analysis .",
    "hence , the decay pattern of @xmath3 disfavors the assignment as @xmath19_3 $ ] .",
    "in this work , the internal structures of the @xmath36 and the @xmath9 are investigated .",
    "the experimental data for the photoproduction of @xmath1 off proton released by the clas and leps collaborations suggest the explanation of the @xmath9 as the third state with @xmath0 in the constituent quark model .",
    "the @xmath3 is explained as a bound state from the interaction of @xmath29 and kaon , which is supported by the numerical results of both binding energy and decay pattern of the bound state of @xmath37 system with isospin @xmath28 and spin - parity @xmath0 .",
