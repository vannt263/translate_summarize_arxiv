    "the gutzwiller wave function is the simplest many - particle wave function capable of capturing both itinerant and localized characters of strongly correlated electrons @xcite . for a long time , it has been considered as a variational wave function for standard models such as the hubbard model and the _ t - j _",
    "model @xcite .",
    "it is now known that the gutzwiller wave function without double occupancy for each site constitutes the exact ground state for the supersymmetric _ t - j _ model in one dimension , for which both the exchange and transfer terms in the hamiltonian decay as inverse square of the distance @xcite .",
    "given this context , it is highly meaningful to derive exact properties for the gutzwiller wave function without double occupation per site .",
    "various quantities have been studied exactly such as the spin and charge correlation functions , and the momentum distribution which is the fourier transform of the density matrix .",
    "although the correlation functions have been obtained in a simple closed form @xcite , most results for the momentum distribution still involve a final integration , or summation over infinite series @xcite .",
    "for a case with finite magnetization , kollar and vollhardt @xcite extended the method of ref.@xcite , and obtained the infinite series expansion of the momentum distribution .",
    "the expansion is valid for general dimensions and general degree of restricting the double occupation . in one dimension",
    "they could sum up the series into a form involving a single integral over elliptic functions .",
    "the resultant mathematical form is very complicated , and it is difficult to obtain any insight from the final formula in ref.@xcite .    on the other hand , a completely different approach has been taken by arikawa et al @xcite . namely , the exact green function is integrated over the energy to give the momentum distribution .",
    "the result has been obtained only for the singlet ground state , and still involves integrals .",
    "however , the structure of the integral makes it clear how the elementary excitations of spin and charge determine the momentum distribution .    in a previous paper @xcite , hereafter referred to as i , we adopted another approach , and derived the exact density matrix of the gutzwiller wave function in a closed form .",
    "our results in i , however , have been restricted to the majority - spin component . in this paper , we derive the minority spin component , completing the analytic derivation for all magnetizations and all densities . in the singlet ground state without magnetization , the limit from the minority spin agrees with that from the majority spin .    our strategy in i and this paper is to approach in the real space instead of the momentum space . in the real space ,",
    "all singularities in the momentum distribution appear in the asymptotic behavior of the density matrix .",
    "hence we can avoid dividing the momentum space into different regions separated by characteristic momenta .",
    "this paper gives the explicit form of the density matrix with use of bessel functions .",
    "the form obtained allows interpretation in terms of elementary excitations of spin and charge .",
    "it is remarkable that different spin and charge velocities combine in such a way as to reproduce the asymptotic behavior expected from combination of the fermi momenta of up and down spins .",
    "we work with the particular representation of the gutzwiller wave function with exclusion of double occupancy at each site .",
    "we choose as the reference state the fully polarized state @xmath5 where each site is occupied by an up spin @xcite .",
    "then a down spin at site @xmath6 is created by operating with @xmath7 on @xmath5 , and a hole by @xmath8 .",
    "note that @xmath9 does not obey the ordinary anticommutation rule of fermions .",
    "we can represent any state in terms of the wave function @xmath10 as @xcite @xmath11 where the set of coordinates @xmath12 specifies the positions of @xmath13 magnons , and @xmath14 specifies those of @xmath15 holes .",
    "we call this scheme the magnon - hole representation .",
    "the hard - core constraint is satisfied by the property @xmath16 . by definition @xmath17",
    "is symmetric against interchange of down - spin coordinates , and antisymmetric against hole coordinates .",
    "this is related to the commutation rule @xmath18 and the anticommutation rule @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",

    "this form is valid for non - negative magnetization , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath27 we have omitted a normalization factor here .",
    "here we have assumed the simplest case of @xmath28 and @xmath13 even , and @xmath15 odd @xcite , for which the ground state is nondegenerate . in the thermodynamic limit , the result does not depend on the choice of even or odd numbers of particles .",
    "the momentum associated with @xmath29 is @xmath30 because we have taken @xmath31 odd .",
    "however the reference state @xmath5 itself has momentum @xmath30 since the occupied set of momentum includes one of the brillouin zone boundary @xmath30 , which does not cancel with the rest of occupied momentum .",
    "thus the gutzwiller state @xmath32 has zero momentum because of the cancellation of @xmath30 in @xmath5 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the complex coordinate @xmath33 for both magnons and holes using the identity : @xmath34   =   ( z_i - z_j)/\\sqrt{z_i z_j}.\\ ] ] then the gutzwiller wave function is given as a polynomial of these complex coordinates , apart from the factor for the galilean boost .",

    "the gutzwiller wave function given by eq.([gutzwiller - m ] ) turns out to give the exact ground state of the _ t - j _ model with a special condition for the transfer and the exchange interaction @xcite .",

    "hence the length @xmath28 of the system gives also the number of lattice sites .",
    "we work with the electron density matrix @xmath47 for spin up @xmath48 and spin down @xmath49 electrons , which is the fourier transform of the momentum distribution function @xmath50 .",

    "we have written @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",

    "the other part @xmath56 requires more elaborate calculation , which is presented in this paper .    for the down spin part of the density matrix",

    "we will refer to @xmath60 as the propagator . ignoring the kronecker s @xmath61 in the last expression , the expectation value forces one of the holes in the ket wavefunction to be at @xmath0 and one of the magnons at the zeroth site , while in the bra wavefunction this is reversed .",
    "all other holes and magnons have to be matched in the bra and ket wavefunctions .    using eq.([lowest ] ) with eqs.([hole ] ) and ( [ psi_m ] ) , we use the normalization @xmath62 ( since @xmath63 and @xmath64 are products of real factors , complex conjugation is not necessary . ) therefore , evaluating the expectation value in eq.([expect ] ) in the ground state with @xmath58 holes and @xmath57 magnons , we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 , and the factor @xmath67 represents a system with @xmath68 holes and @xmath13 magnons . eq.([exp_coord ] ) can be written in terms of the wavefunction for @xmath15 holes and @xmath13 magnons , with the first two holes at the zeroth and @xmath0 sites , as @xmath69 which further simplifies to @xmath70 in this last expression , the expectation value is evaluated in the ground state with @xmath13 magnons and @xmath15 holes , with hole coordinates at @xmath71 and magnon coordinates at @xmath72 the factors of @xmath28 associated with the kronecker s @xmath61 makes them @xmath73 in the thermodynamic limit .    in eq.([expectation ] ) , there is a factor for each magnon coordinate which can be expanded as @xmath74/z_i - z_i\\exp[-i\\phi ] , \\label{poly_factor}\\ ] ] after defining @xmath75 $ ] , or @xmath76 .",
    "the product of each of these factors can , inside the expectation value of eq.([expectation ] ) , be expressed as a sum of diagrams , similar to i. this is pursued further in the next section .",
    "we first review how the normalization @xmath77 is evaluated .",
    "this discussion is almost identical to that in ref.@xcite , but is reproduced here because it is essential to understanding the diagrammatic expansion .",
    "we make extensive use of a determinant representation of @xmath78 following ref.@xcite .",
    "we introduce a notation @xmath79 where the suffix @xmath80 means the vandermonde determinant . in the matrix for the determinant",

    "one can verify that there is no additional factor of @xmath94 from the determinants ; taking the diagonal term from both determinants , which has a coefficient of @xmath95 one obtains the lowest power possible for @xmath96 followed by the next lowest power for @xmath97 and so on . on the other hand , in the polynomials in eq.([hole ] ) and ( [ psi_m ] ) , since each @xmath98 has @xmath99 this term is obtained by taking @xmath100 from each such factor .",

    "therefore in the diagrams contributing to the expectation value in eq.([expect ] ) , the total momentum for each magnon is 0 or @xmath132 while the total momentum for each hole is still zero . here",

    "this generalizes to the subsequent , more complicated , classes of diagrams : diagrams occur in complementary pairs , where the two diagrams in a pair differ in that the partners of the jokers are exchanged .",

    "this is reasonable , since @xmath60 involves destroying a hole and a magnon in the ground state , and the same site can not have both a hole and a magnon .      in these diagrams , one joker partners with a white circle above the magnon hole boundary .",
    "the white circle that it would have paired with now has to be partnered .",

    "the factor of @xmath162 is because beyond the @xmath159th level above the magnon hole boundary , the magnon lines are horizontal or dimerize as in type i diagrams .",
    "the contribution from these magnons is as if the magnon hole boundary was moved up by @xmath159 levels .",
    "the factor of @xmath163 is because each magnon line contributes a factor equal to its total momentum .",
    "the lowest @xmath159 magnon lines , which are no longer horizontal , have each been reduced in total momentum by unity .",
    "the factor of @xmath164 is because the joker at @xmath134 has a total momentum of @xmath165 resulting in a factor of @xmath166 the factor of @xmath167 comes because @xmath159 magnon lines each have total momentum @xmath168 from the vandermonde and alternant determinants , so they must each have taken a factor of @xmath169 from eq.([poly_factor ] ) , and there is an additional @xmath170 permutation factor from the determinants because the line from the joker goes over @xmath159 magnon lines it was previously under .",
    "the next case is the group of diagrams complementary to the ones just considered , shown in the second panel in fig .",
