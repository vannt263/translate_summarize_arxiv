    "semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering has been successfully studied in the framework of perturbative qcd @xcite , at least in the case in which the transverse momentum of the produced hadron is of order of the hard scale @xmath1 .    in the last few years",
    "a new attention has been devoted to this process in the limit in which the transverse momentum , or equivalently the momentum transfer @xmath2 between the incoming and outgoing hadron , is very small with respect to @xmath1 . in this limit",
    "the process is dominated by the target fragmentation mechanism and , for this reason , a new approach in terms of the so called _ fracture functions _ has been proposed @xcite , and developed @xcite .    in this",
    "talk i present a calculation @xcite of the semi - inclusive cross section in the target fragmentation region ( @xmath3 ) in @xmath0 model field theory .",
    "this model has revealed itself a nice laboratory to study strong interactions at short distances , since it is asymptotically free and it has a much milder structure of infrared singularities with respect to qcd @xcite .",
    "in fact there are no soft but only collinear singularities and so factorization becomes simpler to deal with @xcite .",
    "i will start recalling some results one gets for inclusive dis .",
    "let us consider the process @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "we define as usual @xmath6 the structure function can be defined as @xmath7 it is easy to calculate the parton - current cross section @xmath8 in dimensional regularization ( @xmath9 ) . at lowest order we get ( see fig . [ dis0 ] )    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the large @xmath1 limit of the semi - inclusive cross section can be studied by looking at the singularities in the limit @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the strength of such singularities can be predicted by using infrared power counting @xcite .",
    "starting from a given diagram , its _ reduced _ form in the large @xmath13 limit is constructed by simply contracting to a point all the lines whose momenta are not on shell . in @xmath0 the general leading diagrams in the large @xmath1 limit for the process under study involve a jet subdiagram @xmath14 , composed by on shell lines collinear to the incoming particle , from which the detected particle emerges in the forward direction and a hard subgraph @xmath15 in which momenta of order @xmath13 circulate , which is connected to the jet by the minimum number of collinear lines .",
    "additional lines connecting @xmath14 to @xmath15 as well as soft lines connecting them are suppressed by power counting .",
    "so one can say that in @xmath0 the leading diagrams are of the form depicted in fig .",
    "[ leading ] and this means that in this model eq .",
    "( [ fact ] ) holds at all orders @xcite .",
    "in this talk i have presented an explicit calculation of the one particle deep inelastic cross section in the target fragmentation region within @xmath0 model field theory .",
    "the renormalized hard cross section gets a large @xmath16 correction as expected in a two scale regime and the coefficient driving this logarithmic correction is precisely the scalar dglap kernel .",
    "furthermore the result obtained fits within an extended factorization hypothesis @xcite .",
    "in fact the partonic semi - inclusive cross section factorizes into a convolution of a new object , a generalized cut vertex @xmath17 @xcite , with four rather than two external legs , and a coefficient function @xmath18 which is the same as the one of inclusive dis .",
    "infrared power counting applied to this process allows to say that this last result holds in @xmath0 at all orders .",
