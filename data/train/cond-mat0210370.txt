    "activated processes that can be described with some type of brownian dynamics are abundant in the world around us .",
    "well - known examples are the nucleation of droplets in an undercooled gas or of crystals in an undercooled liquid , chemical reactions and the escape of a protein from a misfolded state .",
    "a prototype system to study such phenomena numerically is the well - known ising model . above the so - called critical temperature , in absence of an external magnetic field , up- and down - pointing spins are roughly equally abundant .",
    "below the critical temperature , the system prefers to be in either of two states : one state with a positive magnetization in which most spins are pointing up , and one state with a negative magnetization .",
    "as long as the system size remains finite , reversals of the magnetization - transitions between positive and negative magnetization - are possible and will occur at a certain average frequency .",
    "these processes are activated , since configurations with magnetization close to zero have a higher free energy than typical configurations with a magnetization close to either of the equilibrium values .    in this manuscript",
    ", we study the time scales associated with magnetization reversal .",
    "a theoretical framework is outlined which is generally applicable to activated processes in systems with brownian type dynamics , and compared to high - accuracy computer simulations . from a practical point of view",
    "magnetization reversals are also of great interest because of applications in memory devices and the like .",
    "one wants to have rapid switching of magnetization under reversals of an external field , but no spontaneus reversals of the magnetization , even if the external field has been turned off . in the literature much attention has been paid to reversal time distributions in the presence of a driving field @xcite , but spontaneous reversals in the absence of a field have hardly been studied .",
    "here we consider the latter case for the prototypical case of an ising model with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we identify the leading scenario for reversals of the magnetization and show that the process may be described to a good approximation by a one - dimensional diffusion process over a potential barrier .",
    "our manuscript is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we describe the model that we study in detail . next in section  [ sec : theory ] , we outline the theoretical framework which is generally applicable to activated processes in systems with brownian type dynamics . we then apply this framework to our prototypical model magnetization reversal in the ising model . in section  [ sec : sim ] we compare the theoretical predictions with high - accuracy computational results .",
    "we consider the ising model on a @xmath0 rectangular lattice with periodic ( helical ) boundary conditions , with the hamiltonian @xmath1 in which @xmath2 is the spin at site @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the coupling constant .",
    "the summation runs over all pairs of nearest - neighbor sites ; those of site @xmath3 are @xmath5 modulo @xmath6 and @xmath7 modulo @xmath6 , with @xmath8 .",
    "the magnetization is defined as @xmath9 ; it can take values @xmath10 ; all through this manuscript , we restrict ourselves to systems in which both @xmath11 and @xmath12 are even . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath13 takes only even values , and summations over a range of possible magnetizations only run over even numbers , with an increment of 2 .",
    "a well - known property of the model is that at sufficiently low temperatures , the distribution of the magnetization @xmath9 becomes bimodal : the spins in a configuration tend to align around the two preferred values @xmath14 . for infinite systems",
    "this occurs at all temperatures below the critical temperature @xmath15 , for finite systems this range starts at slightly different temperatures .",
    "the system evolves in time according to single - spin - flip dynamics with metropolis acceptance probabilities  @xcite . if @xmath16 is the configuration after @xmath3 proposed spin flips , a trial configuration @xmath17 is generated by flipping a single spin at a random site .",
    "this trial configuration is then either accepted ( @xmath18 ) or rejected ( @xmath19 ) ; the acceptance probability is given by @xmath20,\\ ] ] in which @xmath21 with boltzmann constant @xmath22 and temperature @xmath23 .",
    "the time scale is set such that in one unit of time , on average each spin is proposed to be flipped once .",
    "so in our system , in one unit of time we perform @xmath24 monte carlo steps .",
    "our current interest in the ising model with single - spin - flip dynamics stems from the fact that in finite systems , the configurations will occasionally switch between states in which the magnetization is either negative or positive , through an activated process .",
    "the dominant pathway at low temperatures consists of the formation of a single pair of closed interfaces in the shorter periodic direction ( for @xmath25 ) , which perform a relative diffusive motion around the longer periodic direction and annihilate after meeting each other through the periodic boundary .",
    "a series of snapshots , illustrating this process , is presented in figure  [ fig : path1 ] .",
    "to study the behavior of times between magnetization reversals at temperatures below the critical one we may consider an ensemble of a large number of systems prepared in states with a magnetization close to the equilibrium value @xmath26 and study the rate at which these systems reach the value @xmath27 , after which they are removed from the ensemble .",
    "alternatively , the behavior of times between zero - crossings of the magnetization can be studied , as discussed below .",
    "the spin - flip dynamics described above may be represented by a master equation for the probability distribution @xmath28 of finding a system in the state @xmath29 at time @xmath30 . due to the huge number of possible states this master equation can not be solved analytically or even numerically for system sizes of practical interest .",
    "therefore , as an approximation we assume that we may replace the exact master equation by an approximate master equation for the probability @xmath31 of finding a system with magnetization @xmath13 at time @xmath30 .",
    "the form of this equation is @xmath32 with @xmath33 the transition rate from @xmath13 to @xmath34 .",
    "it ignores the fact that the actual transition rates will depend on the geometry of the state under consideration , with the idea that in typical cases spin states of very similar geometry will dominate the set of states with given @xmath13 .",
    "besides on @xmath13 and @xmath35 the transition rates will depend on the geometry of the system , that is on @xmath11 and @xmath12 . to estimate the scaling behavior of these dependencies we make two further simplifying assumptions :    * first of all , requiring @xmath36",
    ", we assume that states with @xmath37 consist of a single strip of opposite magnetization separated by two phase boundaries of length @xmath11 from the majority spin phase .",
    "the relevant changes of @xmath13 then will be caused by displacements of these boundaries due to flips of spins along them .",
    "the total number of spins available for this will be proportional to @xmath11 , hence the transition rates should also be proportional to @xmath11 and independent of @xmath12 . + this approximation will not be valid for values of @xmath13 that are too close to @xmath14 , as for these the opposite magnetization will typically be found in a closed cluster rather than in a strip .",
    "it will turn out though that the contributions from these @xmath13-values to the reversal frequency are very small for systems of reasonable length . therefore using the approximation @xmath38",
    "also here does not harm .",
    "further we neglect the possibility of having more than one strip of opposite magnetization .",
    "when the temperature gets close to the critical one , when @xmath11 becomes small or when @xmath12 becomes very large , this may not be a good approximation .",
    "we will come back to this in section [ sec : disc ] . in our further theoretical treatment",
    "we will assume that we are in a situation where the single - strip approximation is justified .",
    "* further we neglect changes due to fluctuations of the magnetization caused by the growth and shrinkage of small clusters of the minority spin type . on average these do not contribute to magnetization reversals , so this approximation should be allowed . in case one",
    "considers the first passage frequency through zero magnetization there is a small effect , to which we will come back in section [ sec : disc ] too .    in order that the equilibrium distribution be a stationary solution of the master equation",

    "the first choice corresponds to a real reversal of the magnetization , the second one to a first return to the value @xmath45 .",
    "after this the system will have equal probabilities to actually reverse its magnetization or to return to the equilibrium magnetization value it came from , hence this return frequency should be twice the reversal frequency . the absorbing boundary condition is implemented by setting @xmath46 equal to zero .",

    "the replacement of the sum over @xmath58 by a constant is exact .",
    "in order to apply the above theoretical framework to magnetization reversal times in the ising model , the two ingredients required are : ( i ) the equilibrium probability @xmath41 to find the system in a state with magnetization @xmath13 ; and ( ii ) the transition rates @xmath33 from magnetization @xmath13 to @xmath34 .",
    "we obtain these two ingredients via two different computational approaches .      for various values of @xmath12 and @xmath11 and various temperatures",
    "we make histograms of the distribution of the magnetization @xmath62 and the energy .",
    "since the probability that a state with energy @xmath63 occurs at an inverse temperature @xmath35 is proportional to the boltzmann weight @xmath64 , a histogram made at a certain temperature provides information about the probability distribution at nearby temperatures as well .",

    ", histograms for the magnetization over a wide range of temperatures can be obtained .",
    "as defined above , the free energy @xmath65 is related to the probability that a certain magnetization @xmath13 occurs by @xmath66 .",

    "we note that the probability @xmath69 of finding the system in a state with @xmath45 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( 4.23 ) of chapter v of @xcite as follows .",
    "first note that this equation gives the following approximation for the partition function of a periodic anti - ferromagnetic system with one phase boundary @xcite , which is equivalent to a ferromagnetic system with an anti - periodic boundary : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 the partition function for a homogeneous system ( cf .",

    "if we leave the positions of the two interfaces completely free the magnetization is distributed almost uniformly over all possible even values between @xmath26 and @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , fixing @xmath13 to 0 leads to a reduction of the partition function by a factor of @xmath76 .",
    "thus we arrive at the following result for @xmath69 : @xmath77 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{eq : zeroprob}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for square systems this result has to be modified , because there are two ways to make a strip with opposite magnetization : the interfaces can lie in the horizontal as well as in the vertical direction .",
    "this gives an additional factor 2 in the equation for @xmath69 .",
    "the second ingredient for the theoretical framework in section  [ sec : theory ] consists of the transition rates @xmath33 from magnetization @xmath13 to @xmath34 . as discussed there",
    ", we are actually mostly interested in the contribution to the transition rates that arises from the diffusion parallel to the longer periodic direction of interfaces that span the shorter one .",
    "to estimate this diffusion coefficient numerically , we study systems with anti - periodic boundary conditions : the spins in two neighboring sites @xmath78 and @xmath79 , or in @xmath80 and @xmath81 are aligned if @xmath82 , whereas the spins in two neighboring sites @xmath83 and @xmath84 , or in @xmath85 and @xmath86 , are aligned if @xmath87 .",

    "as soon as @xmath13 is no longer in the interval @xmath94 $ ] , we shift the anti - periodic boundary away from the interface over half the system size ( which will bring the magnetization back in this range ) and then continue .    in practice",
    ", we achieve this by switching from monitoring @xmath13 to monitoring @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "the sign of the steps in @xmath97 depends on the location of the interface : in the lower half this sign will be unchanged , whereas in the upper half it will be reversed .",

    "consequently , we expect @xmath102    for temperatures close to @xmath103 and small @xmath11 , the system might occasionally contain more than a single interface . in that case , equation ( [ eq : d ] ) would overestimate the diffusion coefficient of an interface . since the additional free energy cost of interfaces increases linearly with @xmath11 , this unwanted contribution to @xmath100 decreases exponentially with @xmath11 . taking this into account",

    "( [ detbal ] ) and the free energy as a function of magnetization , specifies all the transition rates . using ( [ seven ] )",
    "we can now predict the magnetization reversal times .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : estim - rev ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     one sees by comparing the results of tables i and ii that in most cases the two agree within 20% for temperatures not too close to the critical temperature .",
    "a commonly used first approximation to the description of the time scales of activated processes is arrhenius law , which states that the typical time scale @xmath109 increases exponentially with the height of the ( free ) energy barrier @xmath110 , with a prefactor @xmath111 that depends in a mild way on temperature and system size , @xmath112 if we straightforwardly use the free energy @xmath65 as defined before we can obtain the heights of the free - energy barriers directly from the histograms of the magnetization distribution . to check the accuracy of this ,",
    "we have plotted in figure [ fig : pref ] the ratio of @xmath109 and @xmath113 as a function of inverse temperature @xmath114 , for various system sizes .",
    "clearly , if the prefactor @xmath111 is assumed to be constant , this simple approximation fails to even predict the magnetization reversal times within an order of magnitude .",
    "a little thought reveals that , in the present case , this way of determining the free energy barrier is not entirely satisfactory .",
    "the reason is that for magnetization values around @xmath27 the free energy increases with system size because the range of values through which @xmath13 typically fluctuates , increases as the square root of system size . as a consequence",
    "the probability of finding any specific @xmath13-value decreases .",
    "around @xmath45 on the other hand , no similar effect occurs , due to the wide plateau of the free energy as function of @xmath13 . as a result of this the decrease of probability of finding a given magnetization value for given relative position of the two interfaces is precisely compensated by the probabilities of finding this same magnetization value at different relative positions .",
    "therefore it makes more sense in this case to define the arrhenius factor in an alternative way as @xmath115 . with this definition , where again @xmath116 , it may be interpreted indeed as the equilibrium probability of finding two interfaces dividing the system into equal areas .",
    "but please notice that if , instead of a plateau , the free energy has a maximum of a width small compared to the range of magnetization fluctuations , the first definition of the arrhenius factor is to be preferred .    with the second definition the expression for the decay time in terms of the arrhenius factor becomes @xmath117",
    "in which again one hopes that the prefactor @xmath118 depends on temperature and system dimensions only in a mild way .",
    "on the basis of ( [ seven ] ) and ( [ jumprates ] ) we may conclude that for large systems @xmath118 should simply be proportional to @xmath12 and independent of @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig7 ] shows @xmath118 as a function of inverse temperature for several system sizes . for @xmath119 and 64 both the approximate independence of @xmath11 and the proportionality to @xmath12 are quite well - confirmed , especially if one takes into account that the plateau widths for these system sizes are notably less than @xmath12 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "for @xmath120 the plateau becomes so narrow that the above predictions do not apply .      to obtain an estimate for the magnetization reversal times , we first estimated the most slowly decaying mode in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mode ] ) .",
    "besides comparing the magnetization reversal times , we can also obtain the most slowly decaying eigenmode @xmath49 directly from our monte carlo simulations by measuring the probability difference between the occurrence of a certain magnetization @xmath13 and the occurrence of the opposite magnetization @xmath121 , averaged over a time scale comparable to the magnetization reversal time @xmath109 . since @xmath122 decays much slower than the other antisymmetric ( in @xmath13 ) modes , it will give the dominant contribution to this probability difference .",
    "figure  [ fig : antisym ] compares the most slowly decaying eigenmode as obtained with eq .",
    "( [ eq : mode ] ) with the direct monte carlo measurements , for the @xmath123 system at @xmath124 .",
    "our simulations confirm the global picture we sketched for the process of magnetization reversals in the ising model with stochastic dynamics : a large cluster of opposite magnetization , originating through a fluctuation develops into a pair of interfaces .",
    "these interfaces diffuse around the system and annihilate , leaving the system in the oppositely magnetized phase .",
    "quantitatively this process may be described to a good approximation as a diffusion process in a one - dimensional space with a coordinate describing the total magnetization in the system .",
    "* first of all it may seem remarkable that in almost all cases our theoretical prediction gives a shorter reversal time than the simulations .",
    "since the theory neglects processes that enhance the reversal frequency , such as the formation of more than two simultaneous interfaces and spurious passages of @xmath45 ( see below ) , one might expect an overestimate of the reversal time rather than an underestimate .",
    "the explanation of the latter comes primarily from that part of the process in which a growing cluster of opposite magnetisation transforms into a band around the cylinder . as the cluster",
    "will at first be typically circular in shape ( if the temperature is not too low ) it has to deform into more elliptical shape , with a longer interface than the band , before the latter can be formed . in figure 2 the signs of this are very clear in the form of little shoulders on the sides of the plateaus in the free energies .",
    "the transition rates @xmath33 for the formation of these elliptical shapes will not be proportional to @xmath11 but much smaller , since this growth mainly occurs along the short sides of the cluster .",
    "the contributions from these terms in the denominator of ( [ seven ] ) are therefore larger than estimated .",
    "numerically they are important as long as the plateau in the free energy is not too wide .",
    "this then will give rise to a notable decrease of the reversal frequencies from our estimated values .",
    "correcting for this in the theoretical expression would require better estimates of @xmath33 in the free energy shoulders , which seem fairly complicated to obtain .",
    "also the growth rates in the magnetization regions beyond the shoulders , where the growing clusters are even smaller , are overestimated by ( [ jumprates ] ) , but these are weighted less as the free energies there are smaller . *",
    "the above considerations clearly reveal the possibility that the coordinate parametrizing the `` reaction path '' ( here the magnetization ) changes non - monotonically along this reaction path ; one could imagine that the growing cluster , before turning into a strip , typically decreases in size for a while . in reality",
    "this does not seem to happen , but if this were the case , parts of the reaction path with different cluster shape but equal magnetization would be lumped together , and the diffusion process along the cluster size coordinate would no longer correspond to the actual path taken by the cluster .",
    "obviously in such a case the reaction coordinate has to be redefined in such a way that the new coordinate is monotonic along the reaction path indeed .",
    "but in complicated situations it may not always be clear what is a proper choice for such a coordinate . * as a consequence of magnetization fluctuations in the bulk , passages of @xmath45 will be registered typically already a short while before the area between the interfaces reaches the value @xmath125 corresponding to an equal division of the system between areas of positive and negative magnetization .",
    "the reason is that the typical time scale for fluctuations of the bulk magnetization is much shorter than that for interface diffusion , so for each location of the interfaces the whole range of accessible magnetization values typically will be scanned . now in most cases this just will give rise to a negligible shift of the time at which the situation of equal areas ( this is the physically relevant criterion ) is reached , but occasionally it may happen that @xmath45 occurs , but the system returns to the pure state it came from without ever reaching equal areas . to check the importance of these events",
    "we may compare the average first passage time from @xmath26 to @xmath76 to that from @xmath14 to @xmath45 .",
    "if the effect of magnetization fluctuations is negligible the ratio of these should be 2 , otherwise it ought to be larger .",
    "note that for the systems considered here the effect of magnetization fluctuations on the first passage time from @xmath26 to @xmath76 is much smaller than that on the first passage time from @xmath26 to @xmath45 , because the probability of returning to @xmath26 without reaching the pure state of positive magnetization , once @xmath27 has been reached , is extremely small .",
    "we have measured this ratio for several system sizes and temperatures , excluding those cases where the occurrence of multiple interfaces is likely , and found that the mean value is @xmath126 , with a standard deviation of @xmath127 . *",
    "it is of interest to investigate how the reversal times depend on the system size parameters . from ( [ seven ] ) we may conclude that for long systems ( but not so long that multiple interface pairs will occur frequently ) the reversal time will become independent of the system length @xmath12 .",
    "for this one should notice first of all that for @xmath13-values on the plateau @xmath128 is proportional to @xmath129 , because the number of ways a pair of interfaces may be placed such that the average magnetization equals @xmath13 , is proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "on the other hand the summation over @xmath13 , which is dominated by @xmath13-values on the plateau , gives rise to a factor close to @xmath12 .",
    "hence to first approximation the reversal frequency @xmath130 is independent of @xmath12 .",
    "remarkably this independence of @xmath12 in fact is observed even better by the numerical results than by the theoretical estimates .",
    "+ in section [ sec:3c ] it was noted already that the product @xmath118 of the reversal frequency and the arrhenius factor @xmath131 depends on @xmath12 and @xmath104 , but is approximately independent of the system width @xmath11 .",
    "notice that square systems may be included in this comparison without problem , as the extra factor of 2 due to the two possible orientations of the interfaces , is properly accounted for in the arrhenius factor .",
    "* we already indicated repeatedly that our theory may be applied only if the probability of having more than two interfaces around the cylinder may be neglected compared to the probability of having just two such interfaces .",
    "for this to be case one has to require @xmath132 . for large enough systems",
    "this condition may be rewritten as @xmath133 , with @xmath134 the surface tension of the interface . for large systems violation of this condition",
