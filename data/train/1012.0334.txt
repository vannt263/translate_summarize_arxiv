    "are composed of gerade ( even ) and ungerade ( odd ) delocalized functions , i.e. , they simultaneously exist in the right and left sub - clouds . oversimplifying the many - body picture of the decay of soliton trains and the development of fragmentation in the system",
    ", we can imagine that at every point in time the system is described by a two - orbital mean - field state made of a single permanent ( fock state ) @xmath40 [ s3 ] with time - dependent occupation numbers and orbitals .",
    "the orbitals comprising this permanent are the above described delocalized even and odd functions . in time , the initially - prepared condensed state @xmath41 ( built from the delocalized even orbital only , see left panels of fig .",
    "2 ) becomes fully fragmented at about @xmath42 ( see left upper panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "then it is described by the mean - field state @xmath43 ( built from both the delocalized even and odd orbitals ) .",
    "such a fragmetned state has been recently predicted to exist in one dimensional attractive becs and called fragmenton [ s4 ] .",
    "what we would like now to compare within this simplified model is the inter - hump forces in the condensed state @xmath41 and fully fragmented state @xmath43 . for completeness , the inter - hump forces in the condensed state @xmath44 ( built from the delocalized odd orbital only , see right panels of fig .",

    "one immediately arrives at the inter - hump force @xmath52 .",

    "the force between the density humps of the @xmath9-phase anti - symmetric soliton train is positive , i.e. , repulsive . for the pure fragmenton @xmath43 this force vanishes asymptotically , because of the @xmath62 prefactor in eq .",
    "this fact allows us to predict that the inter - hump interaction in the fragmented states is always weaker than in the respective two - hump coherent soliton trains .",
    "interestingly , the residual interaction for the pure fragmenton at a large but not yet asymptotic separation is , nevertheless , repulsive . by going from one limit to another ,",
    "i.e. , by transferring the bosons , say , from the @xmath8-phase symmetric to the @xmath9-phase anti - symmetric natural orbital , we see that the character of the interaction gradually changes from attractive to repulsive .",
    "in the present section we would like to investigate the scaling of the lifetime of two - hump solition trains with the number of bosons @xmath38 in the system .",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath8-phase symmetric soliton train . to make the comparison",

    "s2 collects the results for the lifetime as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "we remind that the lifetime is defined as the time @xmath66 where the fragmentation ratio of @xmath67 is reached . translating from dimensionless to dimension - full quantities ,",

    "all in all , we demonstrate that the death of soliton trains is an ultrafast process that takes place on a time scale which is an order of magnitude shorter than relevant time - scales for current experimental setups .",
    "the density profile of bright soliton trains consists of localized structures . as we have seen in the main text this well - known gp ( mean - field ) characteristic",
    "persists on the many - body level as well , despite the fact that the system becomes fragmented .",
    "consequently , the spatial density of low - dimensional attractive systems is not a straightforward indicator for the development of fragmentation in the system , and hence is not likely to be utilized experimentally to identify it . in this section",

    "<S> to get a deeper insight into the physics behind the intriguing many - body results , we examine further the quantum nature of the attractive bosons . </S>",
    "<S> first , we perform the natural orbital analysis of the propagating wave - packets at every point of the propagation time by constructing and diagonalizing the reduced one - body density matrix . </S>",

    "<S> the gp theory implies that the system remains condensed all the time , i.e. , that only one natural orbital remains occupied during the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the many - body dynamics , in contrast , shows that both for the initially - prepared @xmath8-phase soliton train as well as for the @xmath9-phase soliton train the bosons quickly populate the second natural orbital , forming thereby macroscopically ( two - fold ) fragmented many - boson states . </S>",
    "<S> the fate of bright soliton trains is thus death by fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> we note that fragmentation of becs is a general known and well - studied phenomena in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for the @xmath8-phase symmetric initial state </S>",
    "<S> the fragmentation ratio of @xmath24 , where the condensed fraction has decreased by @xmath25 times , is reached already at @xmath26 ( see left upper panel of fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards , the many - body wave - packet dynamics reveals oscillations around the two - fold fragmented state .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9-phase soliton loses its coherence monotonously and lives a bit longer  </S>",
    "<S> it becomes fragmented at @xmath27 ( see right upper panel of fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the changes in the physics are dramatic despite the large separation between the density humps ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1e ) . the lifetime of the @xmath8-phase asymmetric soliton ( not shown ) discussed above and in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 is also @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also found out that increasing the number of atoms in the system and keeping the gp parameter @xmath28 fixed , the lifetime of the soliton trains decreases , i.e. , the lifetime of the initially - prepared coherent objects becomes even shorter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusions are that initially coherent two - hump wave - packets become two - fold fragmented with time , and that the resulting coherence lifetime of the two - hump solitons is finite and ultrashort .    </S>",
    "<S> we have performed similar many - body propagations of initially coherent three - hump and four - hump soliton trains and found that the dynamics leads to the formation of three - fold and four - fold fragmented many - body states , respectively . summarizing , the death of multi - hump soliton trains is a generic rapid inevitable feature of the many - body dynamics of attractive bosons in one dimension , and gives birth to a potentially interesting object like the fragmenton @xcite , also see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result has been obtained for initially coherent states made of different numbers of atoms , different number of the constituting humps , placed at different inter - hump separations , with different inter - hump phases , and of different humps widths .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown so far the death of soliton trains as an emerging many - body phenomenon in one dimensional attractive becs . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to discuss how can it be resolved experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> looking at fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 we recall that on the many - body level the multi - boson attractive wave - packets remain localized objects in real space . </S>",
    "<S> this observation , together with the fragmentation of the reduced one - body density matrix , suggest to look for signatures in the correlation functions , both in coordinate and momentum space , which is done in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the first - order correlation function in coordinate space @xmath29 quantifies the degree of spatial coherence of the interacting system @xcite , and analogously @xmath30 in momentum space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the upper two panels show the first - order correlation functions in coordinate ( left ) and momentum ( right ) space of the initially - prepared coherent @xmath8-phase symmetric soliton train at @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that , within gp theory , the wave - packet remains coherent at all times ; thus the upper two panels represent the first - order correlation functions of the two - hump attractive wave - packet at all times , assuming gp to be valid . in sharp contrast , the first - order correlation functions in coordinate and momentum space , when computed on the many - body level , show prominent structures , see middle and lower four panels in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 , which leave no place for confusion of the rise of fragmentation @xcite and the death of soliton trains . </S>",
    "<S> another quantity of interest is the momentum distribution of the soliton train itself , shown in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is left to determine whether the death of soliton trains is on a time scale relevant for current experimental setups . for this </S>",
    "<S> we consider explicitly @xmath1 @xmath31li atoms ( @xmath32 kg , @xmath33-wave scattering length is @xmath34 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we emulate a quasi-1d cigar - shaped trap in which the transverse confinement is @xmath35 hz , which is amenable to current experimental setups . following @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the transverse confinement renormalizes the interaction strength . combining all the above , </S>",
    "<S> the length scale is given by @xmath36 m , and the time scale by @xmath37 sec . </S>",
    "<S> now , expressing the lifetime of the soliton trains ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) in real time , we get lifetimes of a couple of hundreds of milliseconds ( see @xcite for analysis of the lifetime as a fucntion of @xmath38 ) , much below current experimental run times of a couple of seconds @xcite . </S>",
