    "one of the major questions in galactic astrophysics is what drives the evolution of large disk galaxies such as the milky way ( mw ) . in particular , finding the source of the dependence of the kinematics of stars on age or elemental abundances has been surprisingly difficult .",
    "@xcite presciently suggested that giant molecular clouds can increase the random velocities of stars , while @xcite proposed that spiral structure is responsible for this effect .",
    "other proposals include that kinematic heating occurs through encounters with massive black holes @xcite or satellite galaxies @xcite , or that the velocity dispersion at birth of ( at least some part of ) the disk was high ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these various mechanisms have so far primarily been tested using observations of the age - dependence of the velocity dispersion of stars in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the ratio of the vertical to the radial velocity dispersion @xmath13 .",
    "while the observed density of molecular clouds is too small to produce the observed heating rate and spiral structure is inefficient at generating large vertical velocities @xcite , the combination of the two makes predictions that are largely consistent with observations of young and intermediate - age stars .",
    "this is because transient spiral structure is efficient at developing large radial velocity dispersions at the observed rate @xcite and scattering of molecular clouds is highly efficient at keeping @xmath13 constant at @xmath14 to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "however , strong positive evidence for this picture is currently lacking .    besides spiral structure , the milky way is known to host a central bar @xcite with a mass of about @xmath16 @xcite and a semimajor axis of about @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the impact of the bar on the kinematics of the stellar disk is typically expected to be small , except near the bar s ends or close to the outer lindblad resonance , unless the pattern speed changes significantly . the latter is unlikely , as the pattern speed would typically decrease due to dynamical friction @xcite and the milky way s bar is almost as fast as it can be given the bar s length ( bar corotation should be beyond the bar s semimajor axis ; @xcite ) , possibly indicating that it has not significantly slowed down .",
    "however , the bar may have grown and slowed down simultaneously , thus remaining fast in the above sense @xcite . that the milky way s disk is maximal @xcite also predicts that the bar maintains a large pattern speed for many dynamical times @xcite . however , depending on the relative location of the bar and spiral resonances , the bar could have a large impact on the heating and migration rate of stars near the sun @xcite , in particular leading to stronger radial migration than would be produced by spiral structure alone @xcite .",
    "constraining the properties of the bar and the spiral structure is therefore essential for improving our understanding of the evolution of the stellar disk .",
    "_ hipparcos _ @xcite and more recently the rave survey @xcite have added additional constraints to this picture through observations of the velocity field near the sun . @xcite",
    "reconstructed the full local three - dimensional velocity distribution function ( df ) in the solar neighborhood from astrometric _ hipparcos _ data , revealing a distribution that is far from smooth and is characterized by half a dozen large overdensities or moving groups .",
    "subsequent investigations demonstrated that these systems are likely due to dynamical effects rather than incomplete mixing of newly - formed stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite established that the same type of transient spiral structure that is consistent with the observed heating rate can generate clumps in the local velocity df .",
    "@xcite further demonstrated that the action of the central bar on the local stellar disk can create a moving group similar to the hercules moving group if the sun is near the bar s outer lindblad resonance .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite have performed measurements of the mean velocity field of kinematically - warm stars using rave data ; they detect a gradient of @xmath18 in the galactocentric radial velocity and a complicated pattern of fluctuations not easily explained through a single perturber ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "another detection of a non - axisymmetric velocity was reported by @xcite ( hereafter b12 ) , who found that the solar neighborhood is traveling @xmath19 ahead of the circular velocity in their axisymmetric model .",
    "a particular aspect of non - axisymmetric streaming motions is that they may affect determinations of the milky way s circular velocity @xmath5 and of the sun s motion relative to @xmath5 .",
    "the sum of these  the sun s galactocentric rotational velocity  is crucial for converting observed kinematics from the heliocentric frame to the galactocentric frame , which is the natural frame for interpreting large - scale kinematics . the precisely measured proper motion of sgr a@xmath20 @xcite provides a crucial constraint on the sun s galactocentric velocity ( assuming that sgr a@xmath20 is at rest with respect to the dynamical center of the disk and halo ) , but the present uncertainty in the value of the distance to the galactic center means that the uncertainty in the heliocentric - to - galactocentric coordinate transformation is a serious limiting factor in many analyses of the milky way .",
    "various determinations of the sun s motion with respect to @xmath5 based on solar - neighborhood observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and larger - scale observations ( e.g. , b12 ) differ at the many - sigma level based on their formal uncertainties . this may be due to the unaccounted influence of non - axisymmetry on the kinematics of solar - neighborhood stars .",
    "in this paper we address these issues by exploring the large - scale kinematics of red - clump ( rc ) stars in the mw disk from the apogee survey ( @xcite ; s.  r.  majewski et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) .",
    "the first part of the paper focuses on investigating the large solar motion  defined here as the relative velocity between the sun and the circular velocity at the solar circle in an axisymmetric approximation of the milky way and denoted by @xmath4 . if the milky way is axisymmetric then these two definitions agree and @xmath21 , but more generally they can be different.]found by b12 but by instead using the rc sample , which is superior to the sample used by b12 because it has much more accurate distances .",
    "we find strong evidence in the rc kinematics that the solar motion in the direction of rotation is @xmath22 and therefore that the solar neighborhood is indeed moving @xmath23 faster than the circular velocity . in the second part of the paper , we investigate this result by studying the mean velocity field s deviations from axisymmetric rotation on scales ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . we calculate the power spectrum of fluctuations and find that it exhibits a clear peak at scales corresponding to the response to the central bar .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in @xmath24  [ sec : data ] we briefly discuss the various sources of data we employ to study the velocity field on different scales , and @xmath24  [ sec : psdmethod ] contains our conventions for calculating the two- and one - dimensional power spectrum of velocity fluctuations .",
    "we investigate the dependence of the apogee - rc kinematics on the assumed solar motion and determine a new value for the solar motion by minimizing the large - scale power in the rc kinematics in @xmath24  [ sec : solarmotion ] .",
    "the observed velocity fluctuations on different scales and their power spectrum are presented in @xmath24  [ sec : obspsd ] .",
    "we investigate the expected power spectrum for various types of non - axisymmetric perturbations in @xmath24  [ sec : modelpsd ] and identify the central bar as the most plausible agent responsible for the observed fluctuations .",
    "we discuss our results in the context of previous findings in @xmath24  [ sec : discussion ] and present our conclusions in @xmath24  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we fix the sun s distance to the galactic center to @xmath25 throughout our analysis . in this study",
    "we calculate galactocentric coordinates @xmath26 in a left - handed frame with the sun at @xmath27 , @xmath28 positive toward @xmath29 , @xmath30 increasing toward galactic rotation , and @xmath31 positive toward the north galactic pole . in all of the figures , the disk rotates counter - clockwise ,",
    "that is , it is as seen from the south galactic pole .",
    "we primarily use data from the apogee survey , but also from rave and the geneva - copenhagen survey ( gcs ; @xcite ) to investigate velocity fluctuations on smaller scales than is possible with apogee .",
    "we describe all three data sets briefly in this section .",
    "we use data on the kinematics of rc stars from the dr12 apogee - rc catalog , which is constructed using the method described in detail in @xcite , but applied to the dr12 data .",
    "briefly , rc stars are selected from the superset of all apogee data in sdss - iii dr12 ( c.  ahn et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) using a combination of cuts in the surface - gravity ( @xmath32 ) / effective - temperature ( @xmath33 ) plane and the @xmath34 / metallicity ( @xmath35 $ ] ) plane .",
    "these cuts are chosen to select a pure sample of rc stars for which precise luminosity distances can be determined .",

    "the typical uncertainty on the median velocity is @xmath45 , with smaller values near the sun and larger values at the far edges of the sample .",
    "the observed heliocentric line - of - sight velocity field reflects the combination of the rotation of the galactic disk and the motion of the sun with respect to this rotation ( see , e.g. , b12 ) and spans a range of @xmath46 in the observed volume . with a typical uncertainty of @xmath45",
    ", we therefore measure this combination at extremely high signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "+    we also employ data from the rave survey , selecting a sample of rc stars in rave by applying almost the same cuts  and @xmath33  ( equation  [ 9 ] in @xcite ) to rave that was necessary for apogee because of a relative @xmath32  bias for rc and red - giant stars ( see @xmath24  2.3 of @xcite ) .",

    "we do not perform any other cuts .",
    "this approach creates a sample of 30,783 rc stars in rave , which have spectra with a typical signal - to - noise ratio of 50 per resolution element , line - of - sight velocities with uncertainties of typically @xmath49 , and which are typically within @xmath50 from the sun . for these stars we use the distances from @xcite .",
    "data on the velocity field on small scales is obtained from the gcs catalog @xcite .",
    "we select stars from the gcs catalog that are not flagged as binaries and that have a measured metallicity larger than @xmath51 ; 8,123 stars in gcs satisfy these constraints . while for rave and apogee we use the line - of - sight velocity to investigate the kinematics , for gcs we use the @xmath52 component of the velocity vector , that is , the @xmath53 component of the velocity field in the rectangular galactic coordinate frame .",
    "we employ the @xmath52 component rather than the @xmath54 component of the velocity field , because it has a smaller dispersion , thus making it easier to determine the median velocity .",
    "in @xmath24  [ sec : psd ] we calculate the power spectrum of the mean velocity field in the milky way after subtracting a smooth axisymmetric model .",
    "the power spectrum is a simple , model - independent transformation of the data that , as we argue below , highlights the underlying physical mechanism responsible for non - axisymmetric motions in a powerful manner .",

    "this definition is a factor of two larger than that of the nyquist frequency , but it allows the approximate scale of a fluctuation to be determined as @xmath72 .",
    "we construct the azimuthally - averaged , one - dimensional power spectrum @xmath73 by averaging @xmath65 in bins of @xmath74 and multiplying by @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of points in the @xmath78 grid that fall within the @xmath79 bin .",
    "the two - dimensional velocity field of heliocentric line - of - sight velocities in figure  [ fig : rcvlos ] can be modeled as arising from the combination of three elements : ( a ) the overall differential rotation of the galactic disk ( i.e. , the circular - velocity curve ) , ( b ) the offset between the mean velocity of the population of rc stars and circular rotation ( i.e. , the asymmetric drift ) , and ( c ) the sun s motion with respect to the galactocentric restframe .",
    "we do not attempt to fully model all of these ingredients here ; instead , we adopt the best - fit model from b12 , which consists of a model for the mw potential ( a simple power - law rotation curve ) and for the stellar df , assumed to be axisymmetric and well - mixed .",
    "this model was fit to the kinematics of a sample of stars at fourteen @xmath80 fields in the first year of apogee data , by approximating the two - dimensional df of these stars as a bivariate gaussian with a mean rotational - velocity offset from circular rotation given by a simple asymmetric - drift model and constant radial anisotropy .",
    "the model in b12 was fit to all types of stars in apogee  not only rc stars , but also first - ascent red giants and dwarfs .",
    "only 782 of the 8,155 stars that we select here from the apogee - rc sample were part of the sample of 3,365 stars used in the b12 analysis .",
    "therefore , the samples are largely independent .",
    "the b12 sample extends to larger distances , because it includes luminous red giants up to @xmath81 . for this reason the b12 sample was more suited for determining the parameters of the circular velocity curve and in particular for the circular velocity at the sun itself .",
    "we thus keep most of the parameters of the b12 model fixed for the rc sample used in this paper and focus our attention on the solar motion in the rotational direction .",
    "we set the radial - velocity dispersion of the gaussian df model to @xmath82 , the radial scale length of the population to @xmath17 , and we fix the velocity - dispersion profile to be flat .",
    "the sun s radial motion @xmath83 is fixed to @xmath84 and the sun s vertical velocity @xmath85 is set to @xmath86 @xcite .    with these parameter selections",
    "we can compute the expected mean velocity at the location of each rc star in our sample .",
    "we calculate the peculiar velocities @xmath87 with respect to the mean model prediction at a point with galactocentric cylindrical coordinates @xmath88 @xmath89\\,\\sin l + v_{z,\\odot}\\,\\sin b / \\cos b\\\\ & \\ - \\left[v_c(r)-v_a(r)\\right]\\,\\sin(l+\\phi)\\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the asymmetric drift . by taking the median of these values",
    "we can determine the peculiar velocity field in the mw disk , which should be zero if the disk is axisymmetric .",
    "the peculiar velocity field calculated assuming a flat rotation curve with @xmath91 and a solar motion @xmath92 is displayed in the top left panel of figure  [ fig : rcdvlos ] .",
    "the deviations from zero are large ( @xmath93 ) , but on average the deviation is close to zero .",

    "the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : rcdvlos ] illustrate that this conclusion is largely independent of the assumed value for @xmath5 : for @xmath96 , similar patterns exist in the peculiar velocity field .",
    "this is the case because the mean line - of - sight velocity field @xmath97 assuming axisymmetry is given by @xmath98\\,\\sin(\\phi+l ) -      [ v_c(r_0)+{\\ensuremath{v_{\\odot - c}}}]\\,\\sin l\\,,\\ ] ] where for simplicity we have assumed that the sun s radial motion is zero . for a close - to - flat rotation curve ( @xmath99 ) and a narrow range in @xmath100 , this expression reduces to @xmath101\\,\\sin\\phi\\cos l - [ v_a(r)+{\\ensuremath{v_{\\odot - c}}}]\\,\\sin l\\,,\\ ] ] the dependence on @xmath5 is @xmath102 and because of the narrow @xmath100 range is therefore quite weak ( typical @xmath103 , so typical @xmath104 ) while the dependence on @xmath105 is @xmath106 and thus strong ( we vary both @xmath5 and @xmath105 over @xmath107 ) . as we discuss in @xmath24  [ sec : discussion - vsolar ] below , the difference in the inferred @xmath105 value here and that based on more local observations can be explained by the difference in the survey volumes used in the measurements .",
    "+   +   +    to determine quantitatively for which @xmath105 the large - scale trend in the peculiar velocity field is minimized we compute the one - dimensional power spectrum using the method described in the previous section . this power spectrum is discussed in more detail in the next section . for this application , we note that most of the power is contained in the interval @xmath10 .",
    "we can ask for what value of @xmath105 this power is minimized , that is , which value of @xmath105 minimizes large - scale power in the peculiar velocity field .",
    "this is similar to asking what axisymmetric model for disk kinematics best reproduces the observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : vsolar ] presents the average power on scales @xmath10 as a function of the assumed @xmath105 , for different values of @xmath5 for a flat rotation curve and for a rising and falling rotation curve with @xmath108 .",
    "we also show the effect of using a different model for the stellar df that results in a different asymmetric drift : the thick gray line assumes that the scale length of the exponential decline of the velocity dispersion is @xmath109 ( rather than the flat fiducial profile ) .",
    "this model leads to an asymmetric drift that is different by @xmath110 at @xmath111 and has the opposite radial dependence ( see the bottom panel of figure 4 of b12 ; this model was strongly disfavored by the data in that paper ) .",
    "for all of the different assumptions about the rotation curve and stellar df the power is minimized for @xmath112 . for a flat rotation curve with @xmath91",
    "the minimum occurs at @xmath113 .    to understand potential biases and the random uncertainty associated with this estimate , we have performed monte carlo simulations of the velocities of the rc sample using an axisymmetric dehnen stellar df @xcite with @xmath114 , a scale length @xmath115 , and a flat dispersion profile in a flat - rotation curve potential with @xmath91",
    "the simulated velocity in these simulations is generated at the catalog position of each rc star ; because we are using sub - kpc pixels and the distance uncertainties are much smaller than this , selection and distance - error effects are negligible for this exercise .",
    "for each of 100 simulated samples we determine @xmath105 in the same manner as for the data , assuming a true @xmath105 of @xmath116 .",
    "these simulations reveal that the estimate for @xmath105 is biased low by @xmath117 and has a random uncertainty of @xmath49 .",
    "the bias is most likely due to the gaussian approximation for the velocity distribution , which in reality is skewed toward lower rotational velocities .",
    "we have also performed similar monte carlo simulations where the velocity field is adjusted according to the non - axisymmetric response to the central bar ( with the parameters that we favor in @xmath24  [ sec : psd ] below ) . even in this non - axisymmetric case , @xmath105 as determined by the present procedure is affected by less than @xmath49 . therefore , our best estimate is @xmath118 . a @xmath7",
    "higher or lower @xmath5 shifts @xmath105 by about @xmath119 and a similar move happens for a gently rising or falling rotation curve , so a rather conservative systematic uncertainty on @xmath105 due to incomplete knowledge of @xmath120 is @xmath119 . we discuss the influence on @xmath105 of non - axisymmetric motions on scales larger than those observed here in @xmath24  [ sec : discussion - vsolar ] .",
    "having subtracted an axisymmetric model for the heliocentric line - of - sight velocities in the mid - plane of the mw disk , we can now study the peculiar velocities . on the large scales traced by apogee ,",
    "these are presented in the left panel of figure  [ fig:2dvel ] .",
    "the peculiar velocities have a standard deviation of about @xmath121 , much larger than the uncertainty on the mean peculiar velocity in each pixel , which is typically @xmath45 .",
    "to investigate the properties of the peculiar velocity field on scales @xmath122 that we can not resolve well currently with apogee , we use the data from rave and the gcs in the solar neighborhood described in @xmath24  [ sec : data ] .",
    "these observations are displayed in the middle and right panel of figure  [ fig:2dvel ] , respectively .",
    "for the rave rc stars we use the same axisymmetric model as for apogee , except that we adopt @xmath123 , as this value better fits the rave kinematics @xcite .",
    "we discuss this discrepancy between the global @xmath105 that we employ for apogee and the local value that we adopt for rave in much more detail in @xmath24  [ sec : discussion - vsolar ] . for gcs we simply plot the median @xmath52 velocity from the gcs catalog , because there are no galactic gradients in the @xmath124 covered by the gcs sample .",
    "this figure illustrates that the peculiar motions are mainly confined to large scales , because the range of velocities covered by the color scale is a factor of two and four smaller for the middle and right panels , respectively , compared to the left panel . on the sub - kpc scales probed by rave and gcs , peculiar velocities are uniformly small .    to better quantify this behavior , we calculate the two - dimensional power spectrum of the fluctuations shown in figure  [ fig:2dvel ] .",
    "the one - dimensional , azimuthally - averaged power spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : velpsd ] . in detail , this one - dimensional power spectrum is obtained by following the procedure in @xmath24  [ sec : psdmethod ] for the apogee , rave , and gcs velocity fields in figure  [ fig:2dvel ] separately ; we do not display the smallest @xmath79 and the three largest @xmath79 for each data set to minimize pixelization effects . for each data set we perform 1,000 monte carlo simulations of the noise by generating gaussian random fields scaled to the measurement uncertainty on @xmath87 in observed pixels and we calculate their power spectrum in the same manner .",
    "we subtract the median of these 1,000 noise power spectra from the data and indicate the 95% noise range determined from these simulations .",
    "all power above this 95% noise range is therefore detected at @xmath125 .",
    "the combination of the three data sets allow a measurement of the one - dimensional power spectrum on all scales in the range @xmath126 , excluding only the largest spatial scales in the disk . as an estimate of the expected power on even larger scales",
    ", we include the typical power in elliptical and lopsided modes for mw - like galaxies from @xcite .",
    "if we change the value of @xmath105 used for the apogee - rc sample or if we modify the parameters of the asymmetric - drift model , the only change is that the height of the peak becomes larger ( reflecting the fact that the axisymmetric fit becomes worse ; see figure  [ fig : vsolar ] ) , but the shape of the power spectrum remains the same . as noted by @xcite , the rave rc distances that we employ may be underestimated by @xmath127 .",
    "we have repeated the power - spectrum analysis using @xmath128 larger rave distances and find no qualitative impact on the observed power spectrum .",
    "the observed power spectrum is characterized by a single large peak on scales @xmath129 .",
    "the power on scales smaller than @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) is consistent with being noise in the measurement of @xmath87 .",
    "this result is entirely expected for the kinematically - warm populations of stars in our three samples .",
    "any inhomogeneity on small scales would tend to be washed out by epicyclic motions .",
    "interestingly , the power declines for the two smallest @xmath79 measured by apogee .",
    "this behavior indicates that most of the power in the peculiar velocities in the mw ( at least in the region surveyed by the apogee - rc sample ) is on the @xmath50 scales where the power spectrum peaks . extrapolating this behavior",
    ", we therefore expect that future investigations of peculiar velocities on larger scales will find relatively little power in , e.g. , elliptical or lopsided modes .",
    "using the lack of azimuthal variations in the metallicity distribution in the apogee - rc sample as a constraint , @xcite already limited elliptical modes to streaming motions @xmath132 , although these constraints and equivalent constraints on lopsided modes will become significantly better with future data from apogee-2 , the second phase of the apogee project , which will operate from 2014 to 2020 and which will ( sparsely ) cover the entire disk @xcite .",
    "an investigation of the two - dimensional power spectrum demonstrates that most of the power is in fact in a single peak around @xmath133 , or largely in the @xmath54 direction .",
    "the line - of - sight projection effects and incomplete spatial sampling make it difficult to interpret the two - dimensional power spectrum .",
    "we only model the one - dimensional power spectrum below , because of these difficulties and also because the two - dimensional measurement is noisier .",
    "the peak in the power spectrum occurs at @xmath134 , meaning that the largest variations in the peculiar velocity field are on @xmath50 scales , using our frequency definitions in @xmath24  [ sec : psdmethod ] . among likely culprits",
    ", such a peak can be accurately reproduced by the response to a central bar .",
    "an illustrative model for the response of the disk to the bar that fits the observed peak is overlaid in figure  [ fig : velpsd ] .",
    "this bar has an angle of @xmath135 with respect to the sun ",
    "galactic - center line , a pattern speed of @xmath136 ( where @xmath137 is the local rotational frequency ) , and a radial - force - amplitude at @xmath111 of 1.5% relative to the axisymmetric force .",
    "we discuss this and alternative models further in the next subsection .      to interpret the measurement of the power spectrum of velocity fluctuations ,",
    "we perform simulations of the effect on the velocity field of various non - axisymmetric perturbations to the galactic potential , using the backward - integration technique of @xcite . for an assumed non - axisymmetric perturbation",
    ", this method finds the value of the stellar df at a given phase ",
    "space point today by reverse integration of the orbit until a time @xmath138 before the non - axisymmetric was active ; the df today is then equal to the axisymmetric df at @xmath138 evaluated at the position of the orbit at @xmath138 . specifically , we make use of the ` evolveddiskdf ` implementation of this method in ` galpy ` @xcite .",
    "the spatial dependence of the mean velocity response for the perturbations considered below is similar to that of a kinematically - cold population , as expected from linear perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "however , analytically calculating the amplitude of the kinematically - warm response is in general difficult .",
    "all of the simulations below assume a background potential with a flat rotation curve and an initial df given by a dehnen df @xcite with @xmath114 , a scale length @xmath115 , and a flat dispersion profile ( these properties do not change considerably due to the non - axisymmetric perturbation ) .",
    "we compute the mean peculiar velocity field over @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( the range of the data , see figure  [ fig : rcdvlos ] ) by computing moments of the non - axisymmetric df and then determine its power spectrum in the same way as for the data .",
    "the slope of the rotation curve has only a sub - dominant effect on the power spectrum for all of the perturbations considered below and we therefore only discuss the flat - rotation curve .    the result of these simulations are displayed in the top two panels of figure  [ fig : velpsd_model ] .",
    "the top panel has the results for a central bar , modeled as a simple quadrupole with the same parameters as those of @xcite , except that the bar is 50% stronger , with a radial - force - amplitude at @xmath111 of 1.5% relative to the axisymmetric force ( see the end of the previous section for the full set of bar parameters ) .",
    "the gray curve demonstrates the effect of a bar that is grown over two bar periods and subsequently evolved for two more bar periods ( the default model of @xcite ) .",
    "the red curve displays the effect of an adiabatically - grown bar ; this bar was grown over 68 bar periods and evolved for 7 more periods .",
    "the resulting velocity power spectrum is similar for these two cases , but the more slowly - grown bar gives rise to smaller velocity fluctuations with a somewhat flatter spectrum on large scales .",
    "we also investigate variations in the bar s angle and pattern speed ; these do not strongly affect the shape of the power spectrum , except for the slower bar .",
    "the second panel in figure  [ fig : velpsd_model ] demonstrates the effect of a logarithmic spiral potential with various parameters .",
    "the fiducial spiral model is that of an @xmath141 spiral with a pitch angle of @xmath142 , a pattern speed of @xmath143 that puts the sun close to the @xmath144 inner lindblad resonance , and an angle @xmath145 ( between the sun ",
    "galactic - center line and the line connecting the galactic center to the peak of the spiral pattern at @xmath111 ) of @xmath146 .",
    "the other curves display the effect of variations in these parameters : ( a ) a larger pitch angle , ( b ) a different angle @xmath145 , ( c ) a larger pattern speed that puts the sun near the @xmath147 inner lindblad resonance , ( d ) an @xmath148 spiral with the latter pattern speed , and ( e ) case ( d ) with a different angle @xmath145 .",
    "while the power spectrum of the velocity response to these different spiral perturbations varies , it typically places most of the power on the largest scales in a way that is inconsistent with the observed data , such that spiral structure alone can not explain the observed power spectrum .",
    "the third panel of figure  [ fig : velpsd_model ] shows the power spectrum of velocity fluctuations induced by an elliptical perturbation , that is , a perturbation to the potential @xmath149 $ ] ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a perturbation could result from , e.g. , a triaxial halo . rather than fully simulating the response in the manner described above , we make use of the results of @xcite , who characterized the radial- and rotational- velocity response of a kinematically - warm stellar disk to an elliptical perturbation in detail using the backward - integration technique .",
    "@xcite found that the response is well characterized by the response of a cold disk , which can be computed analytically , multiplied by reduction factors @xmath150 and @xmath151 for the radial and rotational velocity , respectively .",
    "the different colors in the third panel of figure  [ fig : velpsd_model ] demonstrate the response for different radial dependencies of @xmath152 and the line - styles show the effect of varying the angle @xmath153 .",
    "as expected , regardless of the detailed form of the ellipticity , the power spectrum always peaks on the largest scales , with little power on the scales where the observed power spectrum peaks .",
    "finally , we investigate velocity fluctuations in a high - resolution cosmological simulation .",
    "in particular , we examine erisle ( as described in @xcite ) , a member of the eris simulation suite designed to follow the formation of milky - way - sized galaxies .",
    "several key structural and kinematic properties of this simulated galaxy , which closely resemble those of the milky way at @xmath154 , have been studied extensively in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . to mimic the apogee observations",
    ", we calculate the mean velocity @xmath155 as a function of radius using all stars at @xmath156 @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and height @xmath159 from a sun - like position in the simulation ( i.e. , at @xmath109 from the center ) .",
    "we compute the residuals between the median velocity field of stars with ages between 1 and @xmath160 ( to mimic the rc population ) and the velocity field @xmath155 .",
    "this procedure is repeated for 8 different sun - like positions .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : velpsd_model ] displays the median power spectrum of these 8 positions as well as the @xmath161 range .",
    "the velocity fluctuations in the cosmological simulations are of a similar magnitude as those observed in the data , but they are typically found on the largest scales in the apogee - like volume .",
    "direct inspection of the cosmological simulation reveals that the velocity perturbations are most likely generated by spiral structure , which is apparent in the projected surface density , because the simulated galaxy has not experienced a recent major merger nor is the transient , large - scale bar prominent over the last @xmath160 ( the strength of the bar in erisle gradually decreases during this time , likely due to a combination of dynamical friction and gas inflow ; @xcite ) .",
    "the power spectrum of velocity fluctuations is consistent with this interpretation , as it is more like that of the simple spiral simulations than that of the bar , but it is inconsistent with the apogee observations .",
    "after subtracting our best smooth , axisymmetric model for the kinematics of apogee - rc stars , large peculiar velocities on scales @xmath162 exist .",
    "variations in the peculiar velocities on the smaller scales observed in the rave and gcs samples are absent , at least in the solar neighborhood .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with the amplitude of @xmath11 of the observed wiggles in the terminal velocities of hi / co in the mw ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or in the peculiar velocity field in external galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which occur on similar scales , but have usually been interpreted as being due to spiral structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that there are large - scale streaming motions at the amplitude that we observe is therefore not surprising , but it is the first time that these motions are measured at high signal - to - noise ratio in the intermediate  age stellar component .",
    "as is clear from figure  [ fig : velpsd ] and @xmath24  [ sec : modelpsd ] , the observed power spectrum of velocity fluctuations can be accurately modeled as being the response to the central bar and this is the likeliest non - axisymmetric mode that can explain the observations .",
    "a radial - force - amplitude at @xmath111 of 1.5% relative to the axisymmetric force corresponds to a bar mass of @xmath163 , well within the range of other estimates of the bar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . figure  [ fig : barvlos ] directly compares the observed peculiar - velocity field to that in the favored bar model : the left panel displays the observed peculiar - velocity field , the right panel shows the model over the whole galactic disk , and the middle panel expands the region currently observed by apogee .",
    "it is clear that the model reproduces some of the qualitative features of the observed peculiar velocities , although the data exhibit larger fluctuations than those due to the bar , especially at @xmath164 .",
    "the bar model makes strong predictions for the peculiar velocity field that can be determined from future apogee-2 data in the southern hemisphere ( @xmath165 ) or in the outer milky way : at @xmath166 the bar should have almost no perceptible effect on the stellar velocity distribution .",
    "apogee-2 will also be able to constrain the bar further by observations of the whole velocity distribution rather than just its mean @xcite .",
    "that the bar is successful at explaining the observed distribution of power in the peculiar velocity field does not necessarily mean that the effect of other non - axisymmetric modes is negligible .",
    "we almost certainly require additional non - axisymmetry to explain the @xmath167 positive line - of - sight velocities at @xmath164 in the data ( see figure  [ fig : barvlos ] ) .",
    "while it is clear from figure  [ fig : velpsd_model ] that the observed power spectrum places tight constraints on elliptical perturbations , spiral structure at levels that can have significant heating and migration effects are still possible .",
    "future investigations in regions of the disk where the effect of the bar is small ( e.g. , the disk at @xmath168 ) or on much larger scales ( @xmath169 ) can be used to determine the parameters and likely effect of spiral structure .",
    "truly global investigations of the velocity field , however , will be necessary for this .",
    "having characterized the spectrum of velocity fluctuations , we can return to the question of why the solar motion @xmath105 measured by apogee is so much larger than that measured locally and which we denote by @xmath170 .",
    "analyses of the local kinematics of stars in _ hipparcos _",
    "@xcite , gcs @xcite , or rave @xcite all find that @xmath171 to @xmath172 , with the latter value being considered to be more accurate because of unmodeled correlations between the color used to define populations of stars and the populations radial gradients in the former .",
    "a direct examination of the gcs catalog shows that the local value @xmath170 can not be much larger than @xmath172 , because otherwise all of the stars in the solar neighborhood are at their pericenters , a result that would be at odds with everything that is known about galactic disks and the mw disk in particular .",
    "however , the way the local @xmath170 is measured implies that @xmath170 is the solar motion with respect to a hypothetical zero dispersion population at the position of the sun .",
    "if the whole solar neighborhood is participating in a global streaming motion , then there will be an offset between the local @xmath170 and the global @xmath105 , the latter defined as the difference between the sun s rotational velocity and the axisymmetric @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this issue is discussed in detail in b12 .",
    "our new measurement of the peculiar velocity field proves that it is indeed likely that the solar neighborhood is affected by a streaming motion of @xmath173 .",
    "the power spectrum of velocity fluctuations demonstrates that such fluctuations are common on scales of @xmath162 , while there is little power on smaller scales .",
    "this result directly explains why all local surveys , which are limited to distances projected onto the plane @xmath174 measure the same @xmath170 : they are all affected by  and are insensitive to  the same streaming motion .",
    "the global value of @xmath175 that we determined in this paper uses the largest scales in the sample and is therefore less affected by large - scale streaming motions . this value was first obtained by b12 using the first year of apogee data .",
    "because that analysis used more luminous and hence more distant red giants than the rc stars used here , it determined @xmath105 on even larger scales . the fact that the power spectrum turns over around @xmath134 implies that there is little power on the largest scales .",
    "therefore , the global value of @xmath105 measured here and in b12 will not suffer from the large streaming - related systematics that the local @xmath170 experience .",
    "conservatively , we can assign the amplitude of the velocity power measured at the largest scale in our sample@xmath176 at @xmath177as a systematic uncertainty on the global value of @xmath105 .",
    "determinations of the sun s velocity on larger scales than those considered here , for example , by modeling the kinematics of tidal streams , are also global measurements and are by and large consistent with our measurement . for example ,",
    "the large solar velocity with respect to the galactic center obtained from the sgr stream @xcite is consistent with our @xmath4  combined with @xmath178",
    ".    the streaming motion of @xmath172 of the whole solar neighborhood must be caused by a non - axisymmetric perturbation .",
    "the bar model favored above to explain the rc peculiar velocity field includes a rotational streaming motion at the sun of @xmath167 ( using equation  [ 14 ] of @xcite ) , which falls short of explaining the observed streaming motion by @xmath179 .",
    "this discrepancy would only be @xmath180 if the bar angle were @xmath181 .",
    "nevertheless , an additional streaming motion induced by a different non - axisymmetric agent , such as spiral structure , is probably necessary to explain the large streaming motion of the solar neighborhood .    with @xmath92 and the measured proper motion of sgr a@xmath20 of @xmath182 @xcite , @xmath183 therefore , for @xmath184",
    ", this measurement of @xmath5 agrees perfectly with the measurement of b12 . that determination uses a largely different stellar sample and does not include the sgr a@xmath20 proper motion , so this agreement is a genuine consistency check on both analyses .",
    "to increase @xmath5 to @xmath185 requires that @xmath186 , which is highly unlikely given the current best constraints @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : vc ] ) is not entirely correct , as figure  [ fig : vsolar ] demonstrates that the @xmath105 that we measure depends on @xmath5 in such a way that @xmath105 is about @xmath119 lower if @xmath187 .",
    "this dependence , however , only affects the above statement by a percent .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the two - dimensional line - of - sight velocity field in the mw mid - plane out to @xmath2 using apogee - rc stars .",
    "we have focused on two important questions : ( a ) the sun s motion with respect to the circular velocity and ( b ) the residuals from an axisymmetric kinematic model .",
    "we characterized the latter using their power spectrum , finding that the power on scales in the range @xmath188 is fully contained within @xmath189 , with the power on smaller scales consistent with measurement noise .",
    "the most likely perturber that creates power on these scales is the central bar .",
    "we measured the sun s motion with respect to the circular velocity using a new method based on minimizing the large - scale residuals in the peculiar velocity field .",
    "this approach unambiguously determines @xmath105 to be relatively large . in detail , we measure @xmath190)\\pm 5\\,(\\mathrm{syst.\\ [ large\\!-\\!scale]}){\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{km\\ s}^{-1}}}$ ] . here",
    ", we have included systematic uncertainties due to ( a ) a @xmath7 uncertainty in @xmath5 and ( b ) the estimated power on unobserved larger scales .",
    "this measurement agrees with the determination by b12 , which employed an almost independent subsample of apogee data from the one used here and which used a different technique for inferring @xmath105 .    in the future ,",
    "much better measurements of the peculiar velocity field in the mw mid - plane will be possible with data from the _ gaia _ satellite @xcite and from apogee-2 .",
    "_ gaia _ will allow both dimensions of the planar peculiar velocity field to be determined , rather than just the line - of - sight component as done here .",
    "apogee-2 will perform measurements at all galactic longitudes and at much larger distances from the sun in the dust - obscured regions of the disk , crucial for understanding the largest - scale modes affecting the disk s kinematics and for a complete interpretation of the optical _ gaia _ data . performing similar measurements with ongoing surveys of resolved kinematics in galaxies ( e.g. , califa , @xcite ; sami , @xcite ; manga , @xcite ) will be difficult because of the relatively low spectral resolution and typical signal - to - noise ratios of these surveys",
    ". however , muse @xcite could be used to create maps with high enough velocity resolution to determine the power spectrum on the largest scales in nearby galaxies , which would provide an interesting look into the drivers of galaxy evolution in different types of galaxies and environments .",
    "connecting these measurements to that in the milky way will be crucial for determining the exact characteristics and origin of the power in the velocity field on large scales and their implications for the dynamical evolution of stellar populations in galactic disks .",
