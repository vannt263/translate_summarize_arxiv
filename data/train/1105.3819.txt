    "the appearance of nonorthogonal and chiral modes in the spiral cavity has been traced back to the asymmetric scattering between cw and ccw propagating waves at the notch  @xcite .",

    "but the nonorthogonality and the chirality might be small for the case of weak surface roughness that can be achieved nowadays in state - of - the - art experiments",
    ". moreover , averaged over many mode pairs the chirality should be close to zero due to the random character of the boundary profile .",
