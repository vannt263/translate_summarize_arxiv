    "over the last decade there has been continuing interest in quantum phase transitions .",
    "a particular attention has been focused on two - dimensional systems which possess some unusual properties at low temperatures .",
    "it is remarkable , that a phase transition at zero temperature is possible in the framework of the usual bcs theory of superconductivity .",
    "the transition temperature can be suppressed either by magnetic impurities or by magnetic field .",
    "it is interesting to find the fluctuation conductivity as a function of the closeness to the transition in these cases .",
    "the impurity - driven quantum phase transition has been considered by ramazashvili and coleman .",
    "@xcite their consideration was based on the renormalization group analysis of the aslamazov - larkin correction to conductivity .",
    "fluctuations in an external magnetic field have been considered in different systems and various limiting cases .",
    "@xcite however , up till now , there is no consistent microscopic theory of superconducting fluctuations near @xmath3 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop such a theory for two - dimensional superconductors in the dirty and clean limits .",
    "we begin with a brief review of studies of fluctuations in superconductors .",
    "the subject was initiated in the work of aslamazov and larkin .",
    "@xcite the conductivity of fluctuating cooper pairs was calculated in zero magnetic field .",
    "maki @xcite and thomson @xcite included effects of electron scattering off the fluctuations .",
    "it was found that there is another badly divergent contribution known as anomalous maki - thomson correction .",
    "physically , this correction is connected with the coherent scattering of the electrons by the impurities and analogous to the weak localization correction .",
    "the divergence can be removed by introducing a pair - breaking rate .",
    "note , that experimental results at @xmath4 can be described by the aslamazov - larkin term only .",
    "this sugestes that the pair - breaking rate is relatively large in real superconductors .",
    "later , thomson and maki returned to the issue and evaluated fluctuation correction to the normal conductivity in finite fields .",
    "thomson @xcite evaluated paraconductivity for small fields @xmath5 and large fields parallel to a two - dimensional superconducting sample .",
    "ami and maki @xcite considered a dirty three - dimensional superconductor put in an arbitrarily strong magnetic field having calculated the diagrams numerically .",
    "however , some technical simplifications that had been made in the paper ( namely , the dynamic fluctuations had been neglected ) make the results inapplicable at very low temperature .",
    "moreover , three - dimensional case is very different from the two - dimensional one , as shown in the present paper .",
    "let us mention some relatively recent results in this field . in 1993 aronov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite developed a theory of transport phenomena in the fluctuation region in the dirty , clean and superclean ( @xmath6 ) limits .",
    "their consideration was based on the ginzburg - landau equations and , thus , is applicable for relatively small fields @xmath7 only .",
    "@xcite have calculated the fluctuating conductivity of a three - dimensional granular superconductor in the region close to @xmath3 .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] we consider a two - dimensional dirty sample @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the scattering time ) .",
    "we calculate the total fluctuation correction to conductivity which is described by the standard set of diagrams ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we derive an analytical expression for the fluctuation conductivity in the region close to the transition line at low temperature",
    "_ i.e. _ at @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "it is shown that in the case @xmath12 the total correction is positive and has the usual form @xmath13 , while at extremely low temperature @xmath14 ( at zero temperature , in particular ) the total correction becomes negative and logarithmically divergent @xmath15 .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we address the issue of fluctuations in clean superconductors .",
    "this problem is more complex , since the elements upon which the diagrams are built ( current vertices , cooperons _ etc .",
    "_ ) are non - local in the clean limit .",
    "we argue , that the corresponding operators can be found on the basis of the helfand - werthamer theory .",
    "@xcite we apply this theory to our problem and calculate all the necessary values in the following limiting cases : @xmath16 or @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the cyclotron frequency ) .",
    "this allows us to treat the magnetic field effects semiclassically .",
    "the curving of the classical trajectories is taken into account by comparison with the drude conductivity .",
    "the longitudinal and hall conductivities are found .",
    "it is shown , that the fluctuation correction to conductivity in the clean limit is similar to the one in the dirty limit , except for an additional cyclotron resonance - like pole of the second order which appears in the clean case . at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we qualitatively discuss the effects of orbital quantization on the fluctuation conductivity , _",
    "i.e. _ shubnikov - de haas oscillations which become essential at low temperatures @xmath19 .    in sections [ sec:2 ] and [ tc ] , we calculate thermodynamic properties of a superconductor .",
    "we find that magnetization is logarithmically divergent in the first approximation and exceeds landau diamagnetism .",
    "it is found , that in the clean case de haas - van alphen oscillations can become observable at high - enough temperature . under certain circumstances",
    "the oscillating part of the fluctuating magnetization represents the dominant effect .    in sec .",
    "[ 2l ] we calculate the free energy and magnetization in the two - loop approximation for a dirty superconductor . we find that the divergence becomes more severe in the higher orders in the perturbation theory .",
    "we discuss the area of applicability of the results obtained .",
    "we find that the fluctuation region is determined by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , for low temperatures @xmath14 but it becomes wider @xmath22 for relatively large temperatures @xmath12 .",
    "the fluctuation correction to the conductivity beyond the ginzburg region can be found in the perturbation theory .",
    "there are terms of three different types describing the fluctuation conductivity in the first ( one - loop ) approximation .",
    "the first one is the aslamazov - larkin ( al ) term ( see fig .",
    "1.1 ) which is connected with the direct conductivity of the fluctuating cooper pairs .",
    "the al contribution to conductivity is positive . since some fluctuating pairs appear above the transition , the number of normal electrons decreases . according to the drude formula this leads to some decrease in the conductivity of the normal electrons .",
    "this contribution is known as the density of states ( dos ) term ( see figs .",
    "1.5 and 1.8 ) .",
    "it is clear , that this correction must be negative .",
    "the third term is the maki - thomson ( mt ) contribution ( see fig .",
    "1.2 ) which is connected with the coherent scattering of the normal electrons .",
    "the sign of the mt term is not prescribed .    in the presence of impurities all these contributions",
    "must be averaged out over the impurities positions .",
    "this can be done in the framework of the diagram technique developed long ago .",
    "@xcite there is a standard set of diagrams to be considered in our problem ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    these diagrams are built of the following elements : a solid line represents the one - electron green function which in zero field has the form ( in the momentum representation ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fermion matsubara frequency and @xmath25 is the one - particle excitation spectrum . here , we consider the quadratic spectrum .    in the presence of magnetic field @xmath26 the green functions change and contain the effects of orbital quantization .",
    "however , in the presence of strong disorder @xmath17 or at relatively high temperatures @xmath27 , the discrete landau levels are smeared out and the effects of magnetic field can be treated semiclassically .",
    "this means that the green function in the coordinate representation can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the green function in zero field and the path of integration in eq.([gsem ] ) is a straight line .",
    "let us note here , that the system of units @xmath30 is used throughout the paper .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath31 is considered in the landau gauge @xmath32 .",
    "another element is the fluctuation propagator or interaction in the cooper channel ( wavy line ) .",
    "it is a diagonal operator in the landau representation .",
    "the corresponding matrix element has the form : @xcite @xmath33^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 corresponds to the @xmath34-th landau level , @xmath35 is the density of states per spin at the fermi surface , @xmath36 is the bosonic matsubara frequency , corresponding to the total energy in the cooper channel , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "note , that eq.([k ] ) is obtained from the expression for the fluctuation propagator in zero - field by the interchange of @xmath39 by @xmath40 , with @xmath41 being the total momentum in the cooper channel .",
    "the shaded vertices in the diagrams are cooperons , which describe the coherent scattering of two particles off the impurities .",
    "the expression for this quantity has the following form : @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are fermion matsubara frequencies , corresponding to the electron energies .    to calculate the total fluctuation correction to the dc conductivity we have to evaluate all the diagrams 110 as functions of the external matsubara frequency @xmath45 ,",
    "perform analytical continuation to the real frequency axis , take the limit @xmath46 and sum up all the contributions .",
    "the static term , corresponding to @xmath47 , is cancelled out in the final result .    in the vicinity of @xmath48 ( transition temperature in zero - field )",
    "only the al and anomalous mt terms are important .",
    "the typical arguments are as follows .",
    "the point of superconducting transition is determined by the pole of the fluctuation propagator ( wavy line ) .",
    "the al diagram contains two such lines .",
    "thus , close to the transition the corresponding contribution is the most singular one .",
    "another singularity is due to the diffusion - like pole @xmath49 which appears in the mt term @xcite ( recall , that the mt process is connected with the coherent scattering of electrons ) . at small @xmath41 and",
    "@xmath46 this yields a singular contribution .",
    "another simplification which can be made at @xmath4 is the possibility to neglect dynamic fluctuations in the mt and dos terms .",
    "this means that instead of evaluating sum over the internal boson frequency @xmath50 we can just take the first term @xmath51 , which gives the most singular contribution . in the al term",
    "the @xmath50-dependence is considered in the fluctuation propagators only and neglected in the current vertices .",
    "the situation changes if a magnetic field is applied .",
    "@xcite in this case , instead of integrating over @xmath41 , we have to trace the corresponding operators over the landau levels .",
    "the al diagram contains only one singular fluctuation propagator @xmath52 corresponding to the lowest landau level , since the current vertex is not a diagonal operator in the landau representation .",
    "moreover , the small terms @xmath39 , which exist in zero - field , have to be replaced by @xmath53 . obviously , the anomalous mt term does not possess any additional singularity in this case .",
    "thus , we conclude , that different diagrams should give contributions of the same order if a large magnetic field is applied .",
    "let us now perform a representative calculation on the example of the al term ( see fig 1.1 ) .",
    "the corresponding expression for the longitudinal component of the electromagnetic response tensor has the following form : @xmath54 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\left [ t \\sum\\limits_{\\varepsilon } c_n(\\varepsilon , \\omega-\\varepsilon ) c_{n+1}(\\varepsilon - \\omega , \\omega - \\varepsilon ) \\right]^2 , \\label{qal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where factor 4 is due to the spin , constant @xmath55 appears as a result of the integration over @xmath56 in the local current vertex ( see ( [ gamaloc ] ) ) , @xmath57 is the number of states per unit area of a full landau level and @xmath58 are matrix elements of the kinetic momentum .",
    "@xmath59 is the matsubara frequency corresponding to the frequency of the external electric field , @xmath50 and @xmath60 are the internal bosonic and fermionic matsubara frequencies respectively .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the main singularity comes from the fluctuation propagator corresponding to the lowest landau level .",
    "close to the transition it can be written as @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "let us note , that @xmath63 and the bosonic frequency @xmath50 is of the order of temperature .",
    "thus , we conclude that at very low temperatures @xmath14 we can replace the sum over @xmath50 in eq.([qal ] ) by an integral . at relatively high temperatures",
    "@xmath12 we can keep the first term in the sum only . if @xmath64 we have to evaluate the sum .",
    "this also means that we have to consider the effects of dynamic fluctuations as well .",
    "let us discuss some simplifications that can be made in our case ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "first of all , we can consider only the first term @xmath66 in the sum over landau levels in eq.([qal ] ) .",
    "only this term give a singular contribution coming from @xmath52 .",
    "next , we see that the sum over the internal frequency in ( [ qal ] ) is determined by @xmath67 .",
    "this allows us to make expansions with respect to @xmath68 everywhere except @xmath52 with @xmath50 being a matsubara frequency , . with the same accuracy",
    ", we can replace the sum over the fermion energy @xmath60 in eq.([qal ] ) by an integral .",
    "evaluating the integral over @xmath60 , we obtain from eqs.([coop ] , [ qal ] ) @xmath69 . \\label{c01}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , we have to perform analytical continuation in the expression for the current response operator ( [ qal ] ) . in doing this ,",
    "we can present the sum over the matsubara frequency as an integral over the real frequency with the function @xmath70 which is chosen to generate poles at the points @xmath71 .",
    "@xcite making use of eqs.([coop ]  [ c01 ] ) we obtain the following expression for the conductivity ( within the logarithmic accuracy ) @xmath72 , \\label{sigal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are just numbers .",
    "one can see that the first integral in eq.([sigal ] ) is logarithmically divergent .",
    "this divergence appears as a result of our expansions in @xmath75 .",
    "thus , it has to be cut off at @xmath76 .",

    "below we give the results in terms of constants @xmath82 and @xmath83 :    @xmath84    where indexes correspond to a diagram number in fig . 1 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 describe the total correction to the conductivity , which can be written as : @xmath87.\\ ] ]",
    "let us consider some limiting cases .",
    "if the temperature is relatively large @xmath12 , we obtain the following formula for the fluctuation conductivity : @xmath88 if @xmath89 , we can introduce @xmath90 and rewrite eq.([lt ] ) in the usual way @xmath91    if @xmath92 , in the low - temperature limit @xmath14 we have @xmath93 one can see , that even at zero temperature a logarithmic singularity remains and the corresponding correction is negative .",
    "let us note , that the fluctuating conductivity depends on the magnetic field and temperature via their ratio @xmath94 .",
    "the behavior of the conductivity in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath95 , @xmath96 depends on the way how one approaches this point .",
    "if the transition is driven by the magnetic field and the temperature is zero , than the fluctuating correction is negative and logarithmically divergent . if the magnetic field is fixed and @xmath97 , than the correction is positive and diverges as @xmath98 . in the other cases ,",
    "there is a crossover between these two regimes .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    the magnetic field dependence of the fluctuating conductivity is presented on fig .",
    "one can see , that if the magnetic field is relatively large , than the total correction is negative . for any finite temperature",

    "the temperature dependence of the fluctuating conductivity is shown on fig .",
    "3 . it is interesting , that the conductivity is a non - monotonous function of temperature if the magnetic field exceeds @xmath3 .      in this section ,",
    "we investigate the fluctuation correction to the conductivity in the limit @xmath99 . in this case , usual expressions for the particle - particle bubble , fluctuation propagator and current vertices are inapplicable . to calculate the diagrams we have to find these quantities in the presence of the magnetic field while taking into account their non - local structure .",
    "there are several effects associated with the magnetic field applied .",
    "first of all , the superconducting transition itself is governed by the magnetic field at low temperature .",
    "another effect is shubnikov - de haas oscillations in the conductivity due to the quantization of the energy levels .",
    "however , if @xmath17 or @xmath27 the oscillating terms are exponentially small and can be neglected .",
    "note , that @xmath100 in our formal derivation , we assume that either @xmath17 or @xmath101 .",
    "this allows us to consider low temperatures without dealing with de haas oscillations in the green functions .",
    "the effect of the orbital quantization on the fluctuation conductivity will be briefly discussed at the end of this section .",
    "moreover , there is a purely classical effect due to the lorentz force acting on the electrons forming fluctuating pairs .",
    "namely , the magnetic field results in curving of the classical trajectories .",
    "this curving leads to the cyclotron resonance and hall effect in the fluctuation conductivity .",
    "first , we consider fluctuations neglecting the curving , which is eligible if @xmath17 . using the result obtained",
    ", we will be able to derive the formula valid in the superclean case @xmath6 as well .",
    "we now proceed to calculate different blocks in the diagrams .",
    "our calculation is based on the well - known helfand - werthamer theory developed long ago . in the seminal paper ,",
    "@xcite helfand and werthamer evaluated the matrix element @xmath102 for the cooperon in a magnetic field , which determines the upper critical field @xmath103 .",
    "they proved the following mathematical statement which we will refer to as the helfand - werthamer ( hw ) theorem throughout the paper .",
    "let us consider an operator @xmath104 .",
    "suppose , that its kernel in the coordinate representation has the following form : @xmath105 than , the operator can be written as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the kinetic momentum , which can be expressed in terms of the creation and annihilation operators in the landau representation , and @xmath108 is the dimensionality of the system ( @xmath109 in our case ) .",
    "one can see that all the operators involved in our calculations satisfy the hw theorem .",
    "namely , the particle - particle bubble @xmath110 , current vertex @xmath111 and the four green function blocks @xmath112 in the coordinate representation can be written as a product of a function of the coordinate difference and the gauge factor . in the temperature range under consideration",
    ", we can treat the magnetic field effects semiclassically which means that the first factor @xmath113 in eq.([ker ] ) can be considered in zero field .    to calculate the matrix elements of our interest we will do the following .",
    "first , we calculate an operator in zero - field in the momentum representation @xmath114 .",
    "we apply the fourier transformation to this function and put the value obtained @xmath115 in eq.([hwt ] ) .",
    "than , we evaluate the matrix elements for this operator and perform the integration over @xmath116 . finally , we perform the frequency summation left ( over the fermion energy @xmath60 ) .",
    "let us start with the calculation of the non - local fluctuation propagator which has the form : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the interaction constant and @xmath119 with the particle - particle bubble @xmath120 defined by eq.([bubble ] ) .",

    "let us note , that the similar situation takes place when calculating drude conductivity of the normal metal .",

    "the reasonings described above suggest that this term , which describes the curving of the fluctuating pairs , is of the order of @xmath182 and can be neglected .",

    "@xcite this additional hall term was controlled by the phenomenological parameter @xmath187 .",

    "it is valid for the dirty and clean limits and any magnetic fields applied , unless @xmath201 .",

    "this oscillating part can be found by comparison with the drude conductivity and can be written as @xmath202 , where @xmath203 with @xmath204 being the oscillating part of the normal conductivity ( see _ e.g. _ ando _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) however , there are other `` sources '' of quantum oscillations .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath205 oscillates as well @xcite and affects the fluctuation conductivity .",
    "let us also realize , that the oscillations of magnetization ( de haas - van alphen oscillations ) can influence shubnikov - de haas oscillations . under certain conditions , this effect may be dominant .",
    "moreover , magnetization fluctuates as well and in the vicinity of the transition the fluctuations can exceed landau diamagnetism ( see section 3 and ref . ) .",
    "we see , that the oscillating part of the fluctuating conductivity has a complicated structure and can differ significantly from the usual shubnikov - de haas oscillations .",
    "considering thermodynamic properties of a film , we can calculate the free energy directly . in the one - loop approximation",
    ", the free energy can be written as @xcite @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the cooperon .    using eqs.([k ] ) , ( [ coop ] ) and ( [ f1 ] ) , one can easily obtain the magnetization @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the thickness of the film or the interlayer distance , @xmath210 is the number of states of a landau level and function @xmath172 is defined in eq.([ia ] ) .",
    "thus , at low temperature @xmath14 the susceptibility takes the form : @xmath211 one can see , that the fluctuation susceptibility ( [ m0t0 ] ) is large compared to the magnetic susceptibility of the normal metal @xmath212 even far from the transition : @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the ginzburg parameter .",
    "the calculation of magnetization in the clean limit can be done in the same fashion as in the dirty limit . however , there are some features specific for the clean case .",
    "as we have already mentioned , de haas oscillations become essential at low temperature in pure samples .",
    "these quantum oscillations appear in all quantities including green functions , transition temperature @xmath90 , fluctuating conductivity _ etc . _",
    "the oscillating terms are proportional to the factors @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "hence , the oscillations are strongly suppressed , unless @xmath6 and @xmath217 .",
    "let us note , that de haas - van alphen oscillations in the magnetization can reveal themselves much earlier than the quantum oscillations in the other quantities .",
    "this is because magnetization is a derivative of the free energy with respect to the magnetic field . even though the oscillating terms in the green functions are small , they contain fast - oscillating functions @xmath218 which may lead to observable effects in the oscillating magnetization .",
    "it is easy to calculate the fluctuating magnetization with respect to these effects .",
    "we can use eq.([f1 ] ) @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the particle - particle bubble which contains an oscillating part .",
    "the matrix element for the monotonous part of the particle - particle bubble corresponding to the lowest landau level was found in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] ( see eq.([pi0 ] ) ) .",
    "the oscillating part has been considered in a number of papers and has the form : @xcite @xmath221 where @xmath222 and @xmath223 is the magnetic moment of an electron . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we keep the first oscillating term only .    in the vicinity of the transition we can present the magnetization in the following way @xmath224 where for @xmath225 see eq.([l0c ] ) .    from eqs.([l0c ] ) , ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ s1 ] ) , we obtain the following expression for the fluctuating magnetization @xmath226 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\phantom{= } & \\times \\biggl [ \\biggr",

    "thus , we conclude that de haas - van alphen oscillations in magnetization may exist even in the absence of the shubnikov - de haas oscillations and oscillations of the transition temperature .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that the fluctuation effects exceed landau diamagnetism in the clean limit as well ( formula ( [ chil ] ) is valid with @xmath228 ) .",
    "thus , under certain circumstances ( @xmath229 ) the oscillating part of the fluctuating magnetization may be more important than the monotonous part of magnetization and the oscillating part in the landau term .",
    "in the previous sections we found the fluctuation correction to the the transport and thermodynamic properties of a superconductor in a magnetic field in the first ( one - loop ) approximation . the purpose of the given section is to find the order of the subleading corrections .",
    "this will determine the area of applicability of the results obtained .",
    "we shall calculate the magnetization in the two - loop approximation for a dirty superconductor .",
    "this correction can be easily calculated in view of the simplifications described above .",
    "in the two - loop approximation we have to deal with diagrams presented on fig .",
    "4 . the corresponding contribution can be written in the coordinate representation in the following way @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the operator corresponding to the square blocks in the diagrams presented on fig .",
    "this operator is familiar from the usual bcs theory .",
    "it has been calculated by maki @xcite and caroli _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and has the form : @xmath232 ^ 2   + \\left [ \\partial_{(2 ) } - \\partial_{(4 ) } \\right]^2 \\bigl .",

    "again , in the vicinity of the transition line we keep the @xmath66 term only in eq.([lpp ] ) . from eqs.([f2][lpp ] ) , we obtain the free energy per unit volume @xmath239 thus , the magnetization takes the form : @xmath240 at low temperatures @xmath14 we have @xmath241 we see , that the second order correction is negative .    from eqs.([m0 ] ) and ( [ m1 ] ) we obtain the ratio @xmath242,\\ ] ] where @xmath243 is the ginzburg parameter .",
    "the one - loop approximation is valid unless this ratio becomes of the order of unity . at low temperatures @xmath14 , eq.([ratio ] )",
    "yields the following condition @xmath244",
    "if @xmath12 , we have @xmath245 this indicates that at large enough temperatures the fluctuation region becomes wider .",
    "these results stand for the kinetic coefficients as well . in the clean case",
    "the formulae ( [ gi1 ] ) and ( [ gi2 ] ) are valid with @xmath246 . however , explicit calculations are more complicated due to the non - local structure of the @xmath247-operator .",
    "let us note , that at an exponentially low temperature some other effects may reveal themselves . in the dirty case , mesoscopic fluctuations may be important .",
    "@xcite really , the upper critical field depends on disorder .",
    "the distribution of impurities is random .",
    "there are some regions where the concentration of the impurities is such that the upper critical field is smaller than the bulk value .",
    "these regions may form superconducting islands weakly coupled one with another . at",
    "extremely low temperature the proximity effect and the josephson coupling can make these mesoscopic fluctuations observable .",
    "the effects due to the mesoscopic fluctuations will be considered elsewhere .",
    "the central result of the paper is the existence of the logarithmic correction to the conductivity which persists down to zero temperature .",
    "this correction is shown to be negative in the dirty case .",
    "the minus sign comes from the dos diagrams as well as from the anomalous mt term .",
    "the al contribution is positive but numerically smaller .",
    "let us note , that similar results ( negative fluctuation correction to conductivity ) exist for the granular and layered superconductors .",
    "@xcite in these cases the al and mt contributions are parametrically small compared to the dos term .",
    "the fluctuating magnetization exceeds conventional landau diamagnetism for a very large range of fields .",
    "it is shown to be logarithmically divergent as well at @xmath248 .",
    "let us note , that singular behavior of transport and thermodynamic quantities at low temperature is due to the low dimensionality of the system .",
    "in the three dimensional case the leading correction to conductivity is not singular @xmath249 .",
    "the results obtained in the present paper can be checked experimentally by measuring fluctuation conductivity in two - dimensional and quasi - two - dimensional systems .",
    "the results obtained in the dirty limit can be checked by measuring magnetoresistance in dirty superconducting films at low temperature . in this case",
    ", there could be some experimental difficulties connected with the @xmath250-effects that can screen the bulk properties of a film .",
    "the edge effects can be excluded , for example , by putting a sufficient amount of magnetic impurities on the edge of the film .",
    "the clean case may be relevant to high - tc superconductors @xcite and , probably , to the recently discovered two - dimensional organic superconductors .",
    "@xcite let us note , that our results assume s - pairing and isotropic fermi - surface which is not true for high-@xmath251 superconductors .",
    "however , it can be shown , that the logarithmic singularity @xmath252 remains for any pairing type ( with a coefficient different from our case ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that in the overdoped high-@xmath251 superconductors the ginzburg parameter @xmath243 is small and , thus , the fluctuations are negligible . in the underdoped superconductors the fluctuations are extremely large and they lead to a large pseudogap which makes the conventional fermi - liquid theory inapplicable .",
    "hence , optimally doped superconductors should be used to check the results obtained .",

    "this work was supported by nsf grant dmr-9812340 .",
    "in this appendix we derive the formula for the current vertex depending on two frequencies @xmath50 and @xmath59 in the non - local clean limit .",
