    "the hot big bang model and the cosmological perturbation theory , where the physical metric is perturbed around the spatially homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric @xcite , have led to a remarkable success in interpreting the plethora of observational data of the last two decades @xcite .",
    "observations of the temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have been playing an essential role in building the standard cosmological model and measuring its parameters @xcite . in order to maximize the usage of the observational data",
    ", one would like to compute the theoretical prediction on the cmb anisotropy for a given model as accurately as possible , with tolerable time consumption .",
    "computation tools developed over the years such as cmbfast @xcite , camb @xcite , cmbeasy @xcite and class @xcite are capable of computing a cmb angular power spectrum to percent - level accuracy within a few seconds on a modern desktop personal computer .",
    "the crucial technique used in all the fast cmb codes to date is the line - of - sight integration approach @xcite and an assumption that the primordial power spectrum of metric perturbations is smooth .",
    "( here for readability we focus on the comoving curvature perturbations and temperature anisotropies , although the same arguments can be as well applied to the tensor perturbations and cmb polarization . )",
    "a cmb code first computes the radiation transfer function @xmath1 by solving the linear - order boltzmann equations and using the line - of - sight integration method , then convolves @xmath2 with the primordial power spectrum @xmath3 to obtain the cmb angular power spectrum @xmath4 .",
    "the smoothness assumption allow us to compute only a few tens of multipoles spanning from @xmath5 to @xmath6 a few thousands and interpolate the remaining @xmath4 s . furthermore , since @xmath3 is assumed to a smooth function , sparse sampling of the radiation transfer function has been implemented for the integration of each @xmath4 .",
    "a smooth primordial power spectrum is a prediction of the simplest single - field slow - roll inflation models @xcite .",
    "however , local signatures in the primordial power spectrum that makes it deviate from smoothness can arise in various alternative models , for instance , when the inflaton potential has sharp features @xcite , when there is a transition between different stages in the inflaton evolution @xcite , when more than one field is present @xcite , from particle production during inflation @xcite , modulated preheating  @xcite , or , more recently , in models motivated by monodromy in the extra dimensions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these features represent an important window on new physics because they are often related to uv scale phenomena inaccessible to experiments in the laboratory .",
    "for these models , the cmb angular power spectrum is not necessarily smooth , and therefore needs to be computed at each multipole without interpolation .",
    "this increases the computing time by a factor of a few tens .",
    "moreover , for the numerical - integration of each @xmath4 , the sampling frequency in the wavenumber @xmath7 often needs to be increased , again , by a factor of a few tens .",
    "the required sampling frequency in @xmath7 is model - dependent .",
    "it is determined by the larger between the minimum width of the features in the primordial power spectrum and the minimum width of the oscillations in the radiation transfer function .    to keep track of the features in the primordial power spectrum",
    ", one can modify standard cmb codes by naively doing an @xmath0-by-@xmath0 brute - force calculation with increased integration sampling frequency in @xmath7 .",
    "however , in the case where the features in the primordial power spectrum are really sharp ( @xmath8 ) , this naive modification increases the computing time by a factor of @xmath9 ( a few tens in @xmath0 sampling times a few tens in @xmath7 sampling ) .",
    "moreover , the memory that is required to store all the transfer functions and tables of spherical bessel functions can be too large for most desktop personal computers .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to introduce a more optimized algorithm to treat these problems .",
    "in fact , apart from increasing the sampling frequency , that can not be avoided , all the other problems can be significantly alleviated by using the recurrence relation of spherical bessel functions .",
    "an optimized algorithm , which we detail in section  [ sec : cmb ] , is @xmath10 times slower than the standard algorithm for the smooth-@xmath3 case .",
    "this new algorithm has been implemented in the cosmolib package , a self - contained package that we developed to compute cosmological perturbations , cmb angular power spectra , and the forecast constraints on cosmological parameters from future cosmological surveys using fisher matrix analysis and monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) calculation . in particular , the cosmological surveys that we consider are cmb , large scale structure ( lss ) and supernovae ( sn ) .",
    "in addition to the enhanced cmb integrator , cosmolib has a few other features that are complementary to the other publicly available boltzmann / cmb / mcmc codes .",
    "for instance , the mcmc engine in cosmolib has a modified rejection rule that allows the proposal density ( the probability of random - walking to a new point in the parameter space ) to periodically depend some parameters .",
    "this is useful when one considers a likelihood that depends on some periodic parameter .",
    "this happens , for instance , in the context of inflation from axion monodromy @xcite , where the oscillations in the predicted power spectrum depend on a free phase .",
    "moreover , cosmolib treats the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath11 and the primordial scalar and tensor power spectra @xmath12 and @xmath13 , as free functions , which can be either chosen from a list of build - in models or defined by the user .",
    "this makes cosmolib a convenient tool to study non - standard parametrizations of dark energy eos and primordial power spectra .",
    "finally , cosmolib is written in newtonian gauge ( also called poisson gauge ) @xcite , while many other codes are mainly developed in synchronous gauge ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this is a plus - and - minus point .",
    "we found that our newtonian - gauge boltzmann code is slightly slower than the codes written in synchronous gauge .",
    "however , many theoretical works in the literature have derived equations in newtonian gauge . for instance , second - order boltzmann equations have been derived in this gauge @xcite .",
    "implementing these equations in a code already in newtonian gauge would be much easier . to conclude the discussion",
    ", we list the differences between cosmolib and other publicly available cmb codes in table  [ tbl : codes ] .",
    ".comparison between cmb codes [ tbl : codes ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as an application , cosmolib is used to study the `` hints '' of cosine osicllations in the primordial power spectrum that was recently found in refs .",
