    "the dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxies is one of the most interesting and complex of problems .",
    "naturally , galaxy formation is closely connected with the process of large  scale structure formation in the universe .",
    "the main role in the scenario of large  scale structure formation seems to be played by the dark matter .",
    "it is believed that the universe was seeded at some early epoch with low density fluctuations of dark non  baryonic matter , and the evolving distribution of these dark halos provides the arena for galaxy formation .",
    "galaxy formation itself involves collapse of baryons within potential wells of dark halos ( @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of forming galaxies depend on the amount of baryonic matter that can be accumulated in such halos and the efficiency of star formation .",
    "the observational support for this galaxy formation scenario comes from the recent cobe detection of fluctuations in the microwave background (   @xcite ) .",
    "the investigation of galaxy formation is a highly complex subject requiring many different approaches . the formation of self  gravitating inhomogeneities of protogalactic size , the ratio of baryonic and non  baryonic matter ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the origin of the protogalaxy s initial angular momentum ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the protogalaxy s collapse and its subsequent evolution are all usually considered as separate problems .",
    "recent advances in computer technology and numerical methods have allowed detailed modeling of baryon matter dynamics in the universe dominated by collisionless dark matter and , therefore , the detailed gravitational and hydrodynamical description of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the most sophisticated models include radiative processes , star formation and supernova feedback (   @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the results of numerical simulations are essentially affected by the star formation algorithm incorporated into modeling techniques .",
    "the star formation and related processes are still not well understood on either small or large spatial scales , such that the star formation algorithm by which the gas material is converted into stars can only be based on simple theoretical assumptions or on empirical observations of nearby galaxies .",
    "the other most important effect of star formation on the global evolution of a galaxy is caused by a large amount of energy released in supernova explosions and stellar winds .    among numerous methods developed for the modeling of complex three dimensional hydrodynamic phenomena , smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph )",
    "is one of the most popular ( @xcite ) .",
    "its lagrangian nature allows easy combination with fast n  body algorithms , making it suitable for simultaneous description of the complex dynamics of a gas  stellar system ( @xcite ) . as an example of such a combination , the tree - sph code ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    "was successfully applied to the detailed modeling of disk galaxy mergers ( @xcite ) and of galaxy formation and evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second good example is a grape - sph code ( @xcite ; @xcite ) which was successfully used to model the evolution of disk galaxy structure and kinematics .    in recent years",
    ", there have been excellent papers concerning the complex sph modeling of galaxy formation and evolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our code , proposes new `` energetic '' criteria for sf , and suggest a more realistic account of returned chemically enriched gas fraction via snii , snia and pn events .",
    "the simplicity and numerical efficiency of the sph method were the main reasons why we chose this technique for the modeling of the evolution of complex , multi  fragmented triaxial protogalactic systems .",
    "we used our own modification of the hybrid n  body / sph method ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which we call the chemo  dynamical sph ( cd - sph ) code .",
    "the `` dark matter '' and `` stars '' are included in the standard sph algorithm as the n  body collisionless system of particles , which can interact with the gas component only through gravitation ( @xcite ) . the star formation process and supernova explosions are also included in the scheme as proposed by raiteri   ( 1996 ) , but with our own modifications .",
    "continuous hydrodynamic fields in sph are described by the interpolation functions constructed from the known values of these functions at randomly positioned particles ( @xcite ) . following monaghan & lattanzio ( 1985 ) we use for the kernel function @xmath0 the spline expression in the form of :    w_ij = \\ {    lllll 1 - u_ij^2 + u_ij^3 , & , +   + ( 2 - u_ij)^3 , & , +   + 0 , & . +    .

    "the time step @xmath24 for each particle depends on the particle s acceleration @xmath25 and velocity @xmath26 , as well as on viscous forces . to define @xmath24 we use the relation from hiotelis & voglis ( 1991 ) , and adopt courant s number @xmath27 .",
    "we carried out ( @xcite ) a large series of test calculations to check that the code is correct , the conservation laws are obeyed and the hydrodynamic fields are represented adequately , all with good results .",
    "it is well known that star formation ( sf ) regions are associated with giant molecular complexes , especially with regions that are approaching dynamical instability .",
    "the early phase of star formation does not seem to crucially affect the dynamics of a galaxy . from the beginning of the collapse ,",
    "such a system decouples from its surroundings and evolves on a completely different timescale . when the chemically enriched gas content of the galaxy decreases , the heating by winds and supernova explosions ( @xcite ) begins to play an important role in the dynamics of the galaxy .",
    "the overall picture of star formation seems to be understood , but the detailed physics of star formation and accompanying processes , on either small or large scales , remains sketchy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "all the above stated as well as computer constrains cause the using of simplified numerical algorithms of description of conversion of the gaseous material into stars , which are based on simple theoretical assumptions and/or on results of observations of nearby galaxies .    to describe of the process of converting of gaseous material into stars we modify the standard sph star formation algorithm ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , taking into account the presence of random motions in the gaseous environment and the time lag between the initial development of suitable conditions for star formation and star formation itself ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first reasonable requirement incorporated into this algorithm allows selecting `` gas '' particles that are potentially eligible to form stars .",
    "it states that in the separate `` gas '' particle the sf can start if the absolute value of the `` gas '' particle s gravitational energy exceeds the sum of its thermal energy and the energy of random motions :    e_i^gr > e_i^th + e_i^ch .",

    "each model point represents the separate `` star '' particle .",
    "the mass of each `` star '' particle is different ( from @xmath146 up to @xmath147 ) , because the star formation efficiency - @xmath37 is different in each star forming region .",
    "the model point is systematically higher than the observations ( especially near the @xmath148 gyr ) , but if we also analyze the mass of each `` star '' particle we see that the more massive particles systematically show lower metallicity than the observations . if one divides the metallicity to equal zone and calculate the sum of the mass in each metallicity zone in fig .",
