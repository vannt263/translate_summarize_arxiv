    "our knowledge of the distant universe has grown immensely over the past few years , thanks largely to methods that have been developed to isolate populations of high - redshift galaxies from other faint objects .",
    "many of these methods depend on measuring ly-@xmath5 emission or the continuum discontinuity caused by the ly-@xmath5 forest and the lyman break .",
    "these techniques can be effective with large ground - based telescopes up to @xmath9 ; at higher redshifts the observations are seriously compromised by the strong oh airglow emission from the upper atmosphere .    as fig .",
    "[ skycal ] shows , although the oh airglow bands become a major problem longward of 7240  , there are still small portions of the spectrum that are relatively uncontaminated , principally the bandpasses 200300   wide centered around 8150   and 9150  . in these regions ,",
    "the average sky brightness is hardly worse than it is in the @xmath10 band .",
    "we have chosen to concentrate on the 9150   band , since it is the longest - wavelength clear region accessible to ccd detectors .    a combination of advances in detector development , advances in large interference filter design and manufacture , and the availability of 810  m class telescopes now makes it possible to exploit this window for a range of issues in extragalactic astronomy that have previously been out of reach .",
    "some of these form a natural bridge to topics that will be central to the expected program for the new generation space telescope .",
    "the essential feature of our program is the detection of faint objects having fairly strong emission lines with large equivalent widths .",
    "most of our detections will be one of the following : h@xmath5 at @xmath11 ; [ oiii ] @xmath12,5007 at @xmath13 ; [ oii ] @xmath14 at @xmath15 ; or ( possibly ) ly-@xmath5 at @xmath6 . perhaps surprisingly",
    ", we can usually decide among these possibilities from spectra covering only a @xmath0    region .    because we are investing a lot of telescope and analysis time in each of the fields we investigate , we have attempted to combine the emission - line search with other programs that require deep imaging and/or spectroscopy . in particular ,",
    "we have targeted either ( 1 ) 3c radio source fields that would place the [ oii ] @xmath14 doublet within the 9150   window , or ( 2 ) quasar fields with @xmath16 in which we have old galaxy candidates requiring deep spectroscopy for confirmation .",
    "there are obviously many interesting programs that can come out of the very deep flux - limited samples we will eventually have for large numbers of h@xmath5 and [ oiii ] emission - line sources , as well as smaller numbers of [ oii ] sources , but we do not have space to discuss them here . instead , we will concentrate on the possibilities for detection of ly-@xmath5 emitting galaxies at @xmath6 .",
    "early searches for so - called `` primeval galaxies '' were more - or - less predicated on a picture of bulge and e galaxy formation in which essentially all of the star formation takes place within a collapse time scale @xcite",
    ". predicted luminosities and ly-@xmath5 fluxes were accordingly very high , and the lack of detections of such objects in the early surveys ( , 1990 ; see also ; ) was disillusioning , although it did spur efforts to rethink galaxy formation mechanisms .",
    "views on galaxy formation have shifted radically over the past decade , partly as a result of the recognition of the controlling role played by dark matter and of the growing power and sophistication of n - body simulations of the early universe , combined with semi - analytic treatments of dissipation and star formation ( _ e.g. , _  ; ; ) . according to the current view",
    ", most galaxy formation takes place via the accumulation of baryonic matter within dark matter haloes , and the gradual merger of these baryonic `` seeds '' as the dark matter haloes merge .",
    "the timing of star formation ( and thus the formation of `` galaxies '' in the usual sense ) depends on the relative time scales for mergers ( with resultant shock heating of the gas ) and for cooling processes ( which will be inefficient for primordial material ) .    in the optical / ir regime ,",
    "observational approaches towards discovering high - redshift galaxies have tended to emphasize photometric redshift determinations based largely on absorption by the ly-@xmath5 forest and the lyman limit ( , 1996 ; ; ; ) .",
    "discuss the possibility of using narrow - band imaging in the ir .",
    "however , as have emphasized , there is still a place for ly-@xmath5 emission searches , since there should be very little dust present in the very first galaxy generation .",
    "in fact , such searches should be biassed in favor of objects approaching truly `` primeval '' galaxies . determining the nature of such objects is a crucially important component for our understanding of the early phases of galaxy formation in the universe .    within the past year or so , a number of objects with @xmath8 have been claimed , most based at least partly on ly-@xmath5 emission (;",
    ", 1999 ; ; ; ) . some of these , at least , are quite solid and convincing .",
    "our purpose is to investigate the possibility of the developing of significant samples of objects at @xmath6 .",
    "ly-@xmath5 selection of objects at this redshift will give us a unique window on the nature of early galaxy formation in the universe .",
    "one can use the observed ly-@xmath5 fluxes , somewhat cautiously , to make estimates of star - formation rates , and therefore the contribution of such objects to the uv ionizing continuum .",
    "the two concerns are the effect of the ly-@xmath5 forest in removing flux from the emission profile , and the effect of even very small amounts of dust on this resonance line .",
    "however , @xcite find that the equivalent widths in their filter - selected samples ( redshifts 3.4 and 4.5 ) were close to the maximum expected for ionization by stars , leaving little room for dust extinction . in any case",
    ", one can at least determine a lower limit to the star - formation rate .",
    "our filter photometric selection uses three filters : a narrow - band filter with a center wavelength of 9148   and a fwhm of 274   ( henceforth @xmath17 ) , an rg-850 filter combined with the ccd response cutoff ( henceforth @xmath18 ) , and an @xmath10-band filter .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 filters have almost the same effective central wavelengths , but the bandpass of the latter is abouth 5 times larger , so emission - line objects can be recognized from photometry using these two filters alone . the @xmath10 image is useful to look for objects that are also @xmath10-band dropouts .",
    "we carry out automated photometry of the @xmath17 image to produce a catalog of objects detected above a given threshold .",
    "we then do the photometry at corresponding positions of the @xmath18 and @xmath10 images .",
    "objects that are not detected in the @xmath18 filter are generally considered spurious ( although this criterion means rejecting some sources with weak , large - equivalent - width lines ) . from this photometry",
    ", we can construct samples of emission - line candidates , with or without @xmath10-band dropout criteria .    for spectrographic confirmation ,",
    "we first obtain multislit spectra of candidates through the @xmath17 filter , and with moderately high dispersion .",
    "this procedure allows us to obtain simultaneous spectroscopy of @xmath19 objects at once , but only with very restricted wavelength coverage .",
    "nevertheless , we can often obtain a firm redshift from these spectra alone : h@xmath5 often is accompanied by [ nii ] @xmath20 ; in about 2/3 of the cases where we see [ oiii ] @xmath21 , [ oiii ] @xmath22 is also within the bandpass ; we can resolve [ oii ] @xmath14 ; and we should also be able to resolve the expected profile asymmetry in ly-@xmath5 caused by absorption of the blueward wing by the ly-@xmath5 forest . for cases that remain uncertain , we obtain conventional wide - band multislit spectroscopy in order to pick up other spectral features .    in order to go to fainter limits than is possible with filter photometry ,",
    "we have also attempted a blind spectroscopic search .",
    "we still limit our bandpass with the @xmath17 filter , allowing us to use 6 parallel long slits simultaneously .",
    "the targets of interest are mostly @xmath23 in size , so we can adjust the slit widths to trade between sky coverage and sensitivity without seriously compromising spectral resolution .",
    "we have used both 15 and 5  slits in our observations to date . for wide - bandwidth followup spectroscopy of candidates ,",
    "we use conventional multislit masks , with the slitlets oriented nearly perpendicular to the long slits ( since , especially for the wider parallel slits , the position of an object within the width of the slit is uncertain ) .",
    "we have carried out some pilot programs with keck ii / lris in the fields of 3c298 and 3c437 using imaging selection and in the fields of 3c280.1 and 4c15.55 using spectroscopic selection .",
    "the total integrations in our three filters for the 3c298 and 3c437 fields were , respectively , 6000 s and 22800 s in @xmath17 , 6000 s and 10800 s in @xmath18 , and 2700 and 12000 in @xmath10 . while the total integrations were in all cases longer for the 3c437 field ,",
    "observing conditions were more variable , so the longer integrations did not give the detectivity gain that one might have expected .",
    "our 3@xmath24 @xmath25 magnitude formal limits in a 2-diameter aperture were 25.4 , 26.2 , and 27.2 for the 3c298 field for the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath10 filters , respectively , and 25.7 , 26.2 , and 28.0 for the 3c437 field for the same filters .",
    "these correspond to detection limits for emission lines in the @xmath17 filter of @xmath26 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 for the 3c298 field and @xmath27 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 for the 3c437 field .",
    "because our images are typically 07 fwhm or better , we can actually use smaller apertures and improve on these formal limits by about a factor of 2 . for our spectroscopic selection images from 15 slits , with a typical integration of @xmath28 s , the emission - line limit ( again , 3@xmath24 ) was @xmath29 for an aperture with a diameter of 2  in the spatial direction and 12   in the dispersion direction , and in a region free of airglow lines . for nearly stellar objects , the limit was about twice this when we used 5slits .",
    "as a reference , the emission - line flux of the galaxy ssa22-hcm1 , at @xmath30 @xcite , would correspond to @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 if it were seen at @xmath33 , assuming @xmath34 ( 0.5 ) .",
    "we have only just begun exploring these datasets , and we have not yet found any firm ly-@xmath5 detections , although we have a number of possible candidates .",
    "our observations cover @xmath35 square arcmin in imaging mode and @xmath36 square arcmin in spectroscopic mode .",
    "unfortunately , at this stage we can not place useful limits on star - formation rates in ly-@xmath5 emitters at @xmath6 because of the incompleteness of our spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "figure [ s1174 ] shows an example of a spectrum of a faint object found in our 3c298 field .      because luminous ly-@xmath5 emitters at very high redshift are quite rare , an argument in favor of identifying a given line as ly-@xmath5 solely by a process of elimination must always be viewed with some suspicion .",
    "figure [ b08 ] shows the spectrum of a faint object from our spectroscopy of the 3c212 field @xcite . the strong emission line at 8567   has an observed equivalent width of 640  , and no other emission lines are apparent over the observed wavelength range from 6855 to 9477  .",
    "one can eliminate most of the obvious possibilities , and at one point we thought that the line might be ly-@xmath5 .",
    "but careful measurement of the extremely weak continuum showed no discontinuity across the line , and we finally determined that the line must be h@xmath5 , in spite of the absence of [ nii ] @xmath20 , by finding very weak hei @xmath37 emission .",
    "similar objects , though rare , are known locally ; an example is shown in fig .  4o of .",
    "the low metallicities and high ionizations of such objects combine to almost totally suppress low - ionization metal lines .",
    "note that if our spectral range had extended to slightly bluer wavelengths , we would have detected very strong [ oiii ] emission , which would have resolved the issue immediately .",
    "we do have a fair number of cases showing only a single , moderately strong emission line in our 300   bandpass .",
    "for most of these , we can eliminate the possibility that they are either [ oii ] @xmath383727 or [ oiii ] @xmath12,5007 .",
    "the observed equivalent widths are typically @xmath39  , and , if the emission is connected with star formation , almost the only plausible possibilities are h@xmath5 in a low - metallicity dwarf galaxy , h@xmath40 in almost any active starburst galaxy , or ly-@xmath5 ; the higher balmer lines and most other lines are unlikely to have such large equivalent widths",
    ". a fairly strong test would be to obtain good spectroscopy covering the region near 7000  , where [ oii ] @xmath383727 would fall if the line in the 9150   window is h@xmath40 , and where [ oiii ] @xmath21 would fall if the line is h@xmath5 .",
    "in trying to carry out complete campaigns on our fields in a single observing season , we have targeted only the most obvious emission - line candidates .",
    "we plan now to do a more thorough look at each of our fields .",
    "our imaging data so far goes to a depth that is likely right on the edge of detecting the brightest ly-@xmath5 sources at @xmath6 .",
    "we hope to be able to double our present effective imaging integration time in these two fields . over the slightly longer term",
    ", we plan to bring this program to the subaru telescope prime focus camera , where the field of @xmath41 and the use of deep - depletion ccds ( which will double our quantum efficiency at 9150  ) will give us a factor of 40 improvement in throughput .",

    "the keck staff have been extremely helpful ; in particular , bill mason , barb schaefer , and greg wirth each found creative solutions to various problems .",
