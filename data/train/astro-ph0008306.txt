    "there is now strong evidence that the universe is flat and that matter only amounts to about 1/3 of the critical energy , the remaining 2/3 exhibiting a large and negative pressure .",
    "there are several candidates for this dark energy component , which can be characterised by their `` equation of state '' , namely the ratio @xmath0 .",
    "for example the genuine cosmological constant has @xmath1 , while topological defects give @xmath2 for strings or @xmath3 for domain walls .",
    "but dark energy could also be due to a possibly evolving scalar field , in which case the equation of state may vary with time ( and redshift ) .    because they are performed at varying redshifts , luminosity distance measurements of type ia supernovae can",
    ", in principle , provide estimates of this possible varying equation of state . the luminosity distance , however , exhibits strong degeneracies , that may forbid any precise determination of this equation of state , especially if one allows it to vary with redshift .",
    "we first review the expressions involved in the calculation of the luminosity distance , and examine the main degeneracy that shows up when analysing a simulated ( yet realistic ) high statistics sne ia experiment .",
    "we then show how independent knowledge of @xmath4 will limit the effects of the degeneracy and compute the expected statistical and systematic uncertainties that can be achieved with such an experiment .",
    "we assume a flat universe made of 2 components  : non - relativistic matter , which contributes @xmath4 to the critical density , and a single extra component @xmath5 described by its equation of state as a function of redshift : @xmath6    the luminosity distance reads : @xmath7 where r(z ) is the robertson - walker comoving coordinate to an object seen ( via massless photons ) at a redshift z. friedman s equation for a two component flat universe reads : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the matter density , @xmath10 is the dark energy density , and @xmath11 is the total density today .",
    "the equation of state defines the way the component x behaves with expansion : @xmath12 using @xmath13 , this equation can be integrated : @xmath14 one may notice that @xmath15 corresponds to a constant @xmath10 . for the matter component , @xmath9 , @xmath16 which leads to @xmath17 .",
    "since observations favour a negative @xmath18 ( @xcite ) , @xmath19 very likely increases with redshift .",
    "the luminosity distance can be written : @xmath20 @xmath21 is the ( unknown ) function to be determined from measurements of @xmath22 at various redshifts .",
    "for dark energy with negative pressure ( @xmath23i ) , the higher the redshift , the higher the relative matter contribution in the above equation .    to see how the unknown @xmath18 depends on the data @xmath22 , one may invert equation  [ eq : dl_wxeq ] , first by deriving it with respect to z : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "deriving once again yields : @xmath27",
    "so , @xmath18 is related to the first and second derivatives of the distance in a highly non - linear way .",
    "furthermore , the terms in the sums composing the numerator and denominator of equation  [ eq : wxfnr ] are of comparable size and opposite sign : they typically differ by 30 % at a redshift of 1 . as a consequence , small variations of the derivatives of r will result in large variations of @xmath18 .",
    "this is shown the other way around in @xcite , through striking plots .",
    "several papers recently addressed the problem of reconstructing @xmath18 ( or equivalently the potential of a scalar field ) from luminosity distance measurements .",
    "some conclude that it is hopeless given expected uncertainties of large statistics sne ia measurements @xcite , others provide reasonably accurate estimations of @xmath21 , either based on monte - carlo experiments @xcite , or even on available sne ia data @xcite . before attempting to clarify what causes these fundamental differences",
    ", we will warn the reader about a potential misconception that may arise from equation  [ eq : wxfnr ] : both its numerator and denominator are insensitive to @xmath28 because r scales as @xmath29 .",
    "hence w depends on @xmath4 and not on @xmath30 , nor on @xmath28 .",
    "type ia supernovae , have been used to constraint cosmological parameters @xcite . using the light curve width - peak brightness empirical relation , the intrinsic dispersion of peak brightness of sne ia",
    "was found to be about 0.15 magnitude .",
    "a measurement with an total error of 0.2 magnitude is already possible ( it is the best resolution obtained in @xcite ) , and we will assume conservatively this value as a standard error .",
    "it translates into _ relative _ uncertainties of measured luminosity distances of 10 % , which makes the current redshift measurement uncertainty totally negligible . for",
    "the proposed snap space mission @xcite , the accessible redshift range is limited to 1.7 , due mainly to the overwhelming integration times required to reach the expected signal to noise .",
    "there is also a limitation on the low redshift side due to the large area that has to be covered to discover a sufficient number of low redshift supernovae . minimising systematic errors",
    "dictates that the whole sample is observed using the same apparatus .",
    "we will therefore consider as a conservative baseline that 2000 sne ia with redshifts in the range @xmath31 $ ] can be efficiently observed and see how well we can reconstruct @xmath21 .",
    "if we have a dataset of sne ia with redshifts @xmath32 , we may compute least squares estimates of the cosmological parameters by minimising : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the measured luminosity distance , @xmath35 is the set of cosmological parameters to estimate , @xmath36 is the expected value of the luminosity distance for the redshift @xmath37 and the cosmological parameters @xmath35 , p is the relative error ( assumed to be 0.1 ) on the measurement .    if one assumes that @xmath18 is constant(@xmath38 ) , @xmath35 is a 2 component vector @xmath39 . to estimate a varying @xmath18 without any prejudice ,",
    "one may parametrise @xmath18 as a polynomial : @xmath40 choosing a polynomial of z or 1+z does not make any difference from the estimation point of view since there is a one - to - one mapping of the coefficients . using this expression for @xmath18 , equation  [ eq : dl_wxeq ] can be rewritten ( for clarity we limit the polynomial to d=2 ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .    for models with varying @xmath18 , we will concentrate on estimating the 3 parameters : @xmath43 , which is enough to illustrate where the difficulties show up , for 3 different universes @xmath43 = ( 0.3,-1.0,0.0 ) , ( 0.3,-0.8,0.3 ) and ( 0.4,-1.0,1.0 ) , labelled a b and c in the figures .",
    "model a is the standard cosmological constant , model b is close to a quintessence model with an inverse power law potential modified by supergravity  @xcite , and model c is a toy model with a rapidly varying w.    the ( logarithmic ) derivatives shown in figure 1 determine the information that every supernova adds as a function of redshift .",
    "it is clear that higher redshifts provide more information , but this becomes less clear if one considers that several lower redshift objects can be measured in the time required for the measurement of one high redshift object .",
    "one important point to notice is that for a given model , all derivatives are very similar in shape which means that the parameter combination that a redshift probes does not vary strongly with redshift .    to study what influences the variance ( and covariance ) of parameter estimates , we will restrict ourselves to the quadratic approximation of the @xmath44 which consists in linearising @xmath22 as a function of parameters around the chosen model .",
    "this is clearly not to be done for an actual estimation , where an accurate mapping of the actual @xmath44 values ( or of the likelihood ) is necessary to obtain reliable confidence contours . within this linear approximation ,",
    "the hessian of the @xmath44 w.r.t the parameters reads : @xmath45 all derivatives are usually evaluated at the minimum @xmath44 ( i.e. the parameter estimate ) . as we are studying the estimation variance as a function of parameters and dataset , we will evaluate the derivatives at the parameter value , which should be the average estimate value . since @xmath35 is vector ,",
    "h is also a vector , and f is then a matrix , called the fisher ( or information or sometimes weight ) matrix . every @xmath46 term of the sum is a matrix of rank 1 that is the information on the parameters that a given supernova adds . within this linear approximation ,",
    "the covariance matrix of the estimates is just @xmath47 .",
    ".covariance matrix of the estimates for our 3 models ( where diagonal elements are the rms errors and off - diagonal elements are the correlation coefficients ) .",
    "second column gives the square root of eigenvalues , the third gives the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "one may notice that the last eigenvector totally dominates the error budget . especially for model",
    "b , the errors induced by the degeneracy forbid any independent measurement of the parameters .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : three_redshifts ]",
    "we computed in the bayesian approach the @xmath48,@xmath49 joint confidence contours , by marginalizing the estimate probability distribution over @xmath4 with a gaussian prior , without recourse to the linear approximation , we used a gaussian prior with @xmath50 , which is 2 to 3 times better than nowadays precision from large scale structures , and other methods .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 . despite our conservative inputs , model a and model b",
    "can be separated at more than 95 % cl , whatever is the true one .",
    "model b can be separated from domain walls ( @xmath51 ) with the same accuracy .",
    "it is interesting to come back again to the linear approximation to study how estimated errors scale with the ( external ) @xmath4 uncertainty , and the ( internal ) precision of the luminosity distance measurements . adding",
    "a prior is adding a @xmath52 to the @xmath44 , where @xmath53 is the prior value , and @xmath4 remains the parameter to be estimated .",
    "the fisher and covariance matrix become : @xmath54 where @xmath47 and @xmath55 is the ( unit ) vector describing the prior ( here it only concerns @xmath4 ) and @xmath56 is its standard error .",
    "the a posteriori variance of e.g. @xmath49 ( after application of the prior ) reads : @xmath57 where the last approximation holds for @xmath58 ( which is already the case with nowadays precision on @xmath4 ) .",
    "@xmath59 scales with @xmath60 for large @xmath56 , and with @xmath61 for smaller ones .",
    "when @xmath62 , @xmath59 is twice its minimum value ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this happens for @xmath64 for models a , b and c respectively .",
    "doing the same exercise for @xmath48 yields @xmath65 . with @xmath50 and",
    "our assumptions for the experimental precision , the result quality would benefit both from a smaller @xmath56 and from a better luminosity distance measurement .",
    "for an infinitely well defined @xmath4 , we face a second `` degeneracy '' demonstrated by the elongated shape of the error contours .",
    "the orientation of the major axis defines a z ( @xmath66 ) for which @xmath67 is minimal , @xmath68 0.2 to 0.3 .",
    "models with similar @xmath69 but different @xmath49 ( within @xmath70 0.3 in our assumptions ) , will be indistinguishable .",
    "this is shown by figure  1 of @xcite where luminosity distances for different @xmath71 having similar @xmath72 are shown to have the same luminosity distance behaviour .",
    "the overall scale of luminosity distances ( deduced from fluxes ) depends on @xmath73 , where l is the absolute luminosity of the candle .",
    "so distortions that bias the cosmological parameters are the ones that distort the shape of @xmath22 . at lowest order in z , we may model : @xmath74 where @xmath75 ( hopefully small ) accounts for example for the drift of photometric calibration of supernovae across the redshift range , an unknown evolution of supernovae , or light absorption in the intergalactic medium uniformly over the spectral range . the snap mission has been designed to reduce these effects as much as possible , and targets a precision of 0.02 mag over the redshift range @xmath76 which corresponds to @xmath77 .",
    "we computed the parameter biases for our 3 models , with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and found negligible shifts for @xmath4 ( as expected ) , and biases for @xmath80 of ( 0,-0.19 ) , ( -0.01 , 0.10 ) and ( -0.02,-0.12 ) for models a , b and c. these systematic biases are all below the statistical uncertainty , and do not change significantly for @xmath81 = 0.1 or 0.025 .",
    "with conservative hypotheses for the expected performances of a future high statistics sne  ia experiment such as the proposed snap mission , we find that the equation of state parameter of the dark energy can be measured provided an accurate value of @xmath4 is used as a prior .",
    "detailed study of type  ia supernovae such as with the planned nearby supernova factory project  @xcite could result in further reducing the peak - brightness intrinsic dispersion which directly affects the precision on the equation of state parameter .",
    "in addition , independent gain of precision can be achieved by ( moderately ) optimising the redshift distribution of the dataset . finally , it is interesting to note that the required precision on @xmath4 could come from the snap mission itself , using large scale weak lensing which is sensitive to @xmath4 almost independently of dark energy . in @xcite , a ground based moderately deep weak lensing survey of 5x5 degrees",
    "is estimated to measure @xmath4 to 10% ( for @xmath4 around 0.3 ) , reaching 5% for a 10x10 degrees survey .",
