    "`` if we would know the laws of nature and the state of the universe precisely for a certain time , we would be able to predict with certainty the state of the universe for any later time .",
    "but [ [  @xmath1  ] ] it can be the case that small differences in the initial values produce great differences in the later phenomena ; a small error in the former may result in a large error in the latter .",

    "a physical system of a finite number of bodies capable of universal computation will be presented which has the property that certain propositions remain not only provable intractable , but provable unknowable .",
    "pointedly stated , our knowledge of any such system remains incomplete forever .",
    "for the sake of making things worse , we shall `` compress '' and `` compactify '' this kind of physical incompleteness by considering physical observables which are truly random , i.e. , algorithmically incompressible and stochastic .",
    "the methods of construction of physical @xmath0body observables exhibiting the above features turn out to be rather humble and straightforward . in a first step",
    ", it suffices to reduce the problem to the halting problem for universal computation .",
    "this can be achieved by `` embedding '' a universal computer into a suitable physical system of a finite number of bodies .",
    "the associated ballistic computation will be presented in the next section . in a second reduction step",

    "examples of global observables are , for instance , associated with the stability of the solar system and associated with it , bounds for the orbits .",
    "this , of course , stems from the metaphor and robustness of universal computation and the capacity of the @xmath0-body problem to implement universality .",
    "it is no particularity and peculiarity of wang s power series solution .",
    "indeed , the troubles reside in the capabilities to implement peano arithmetic and universal computation by @xmath0-body problems . because of this capacity",
    ", there can not exist other formalizable methods , analytic solutions or approximations capable to decide and compute certain decision problems or observables for the @xmath0-body problem .",
    "chaitin s omega number , the halting probability for universal computers , has been invented in a totally different , unrelated algorithmic context , and with intentions in mind which are seemingly different from issues in classical mechanics .",
