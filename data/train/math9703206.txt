    "we consider classical knot and link exteriors as a context in which to introduce techniques which determine the geometric structure of non - simple @xmath1-generator @xmath0-manifolds from purely algebraic data . here",
    "the application of these techniques are to a pair of related conjectures on the heegaard realization of generators .",
    "these are the so called  two generator is tunnel one \" and  meridional generator \" conjectures .",
    "these two conjectures arise from two of the problems in r. kirby s famous 1978 list [ k ] .",
    "the first is a problem attributed to l. moser which asks for a geometric characterization of those knots and links whose fundamental group may be presented using two group elements .",
    "the  two generator is tunnel one \" conjecture purports to be the solution to this particular problem .",
    "this conjecture is usually attributed to m. scharlemann , who attributes it to a. casson , who notes it is implicit in a question asked in 1967 by f. waldhausen [ w ] .",
    "the second is a problem attributed to s. cappell and j. shaneson which asks if generators which can be represented ( under a suitable choice of basepoint ) by a simple closed curve on the boundary ( the so - called _ meridional _ generators ) correspond to the bridges of a bridge decomposition of the knot exterior .",
    "the meridional generator conjecture asserts an affirmative answer to cappell and shanneson s question although considered in the broader context of a generalized notion of bridge decomposition .",
    "little is known on either of these conjectures .",
    "the only published result on the first is due to s. bleiler [ b ] where the conjecture is established for cable knots . a single published result exists for the second as well .",
    "this is due to m. boileau and b. zimmermann [ bz ] , who use thurston s orbifold technology to show that a knot or link exterior whose group is generated by a pair of meridional elements is in fact two bridge .    the principal result of this paper , theorem 3.1 , classifies those satellites with a two generator presentation in which one of the generators is meridional .",
    "note that this includes all known two generator satellites .",
    "the two generator is tunnel one and meridional generator conjecture for these knots follows as a corollary to the classification .",
    "it also follows from this classification that a two generator satellite knot out in this class is a counter - example to the two generator is tunnel one conjecture .",
    "the key to the classification is an algebraic theorem given in 3.10 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the first and second sections respectively contain the topological and algebraic backgound necessary for the classification theorem which is stated and proved in section three .",
    "the techniques developed here apply more generally to the classification of non - simple @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "the details of this will appear in a subsequent publication .",
    "* 1.1 . * begin by recalling b. clark s construction of a knot whose fundamental group is at most @xmath2-generator [ c ] .",

    "form the exterior of a knot by removing the @xmath3-handle and one of the @xmath4-handles .",
    "the cores of the remaining @xmath4-handles form a set of _ unknotting tunnels _ for the knot @xmath5 .",
    "the minimal cardinality of a set of unknotting tunnels for @xmath5 is called the _ tunnel number _ of @xmath5 .",
    "it follows that the rank of the fundamental group of a tunnel number @xmath6 knot is at most @xmath7 .",
    "it is a consequence of dehn s lemma that the rank of the group of a tunnel number one knot is exactly two .",
    "clark s construction can be generalized to form complements of @xmath6 component links by decomposing the genus @xmath2 handlebody into a collection of @xmath6 @xmath3-handles and @xmath8 @xmath4-handles and deleting a collection of @xmath6 @xmath3-handles and @xmath6 @xmath4-handles .",
    "it is occasionally useful to consider this construction in the context of general 3-manifolds .",
    "next , recall h. doll s generalization of schubert s notion of bridge number [ d ] .",
    "a properly embedded arc @xmath9 in a handlebody is said to be _ trivial _ if there exists an arc @xmath10 in the boundary of the handlebody whose endpoints agree with those of @xmath9 such that @xmath11 bounds a disc in the handlebody .",
    "a knot in a @xmath0-manifold @xmath12 has a _",
    "@xmath13-decomposition _ or alternately , is said to be in _ @xmath14-bridge position with respect to a heegaard surface @xmath15 of genus @xmath2 _ if the knot intersects the closure of each complementary handlebody to @xmath15 in @xmath14 trivial arcs .",
    "one now defines the _",
    "genus @xmath2 bridge number _ for a link @xmath16 to be the minimal number @xmath14 for which the link has a @xmath13 decomposition with respect to a genus @xmath2 splitting of the ambient manifold @xmath12 . note that schubert s original definition of bridge number is the above definition applied to @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "also note that when @xmath19 , by stabilizing the heegaard splitting one can always change bridges to genus , that is , a link with a @xmath13 decomposition always has a @xmath20 decomposition .",
    "that the converse is false is demonstrated by the @xmath21 pretzel knot which has no @xmath22 decomposition ( i.e. is not two bridge ) , but as the closure of the 7-string braid @xmath23 has a @xmath24 decomposition",
    ". see figure 1 . also note from figure 1 that as a pretzel knot",
    ", the @xmath25 pretzel also has a @xmath26 decomposition .",
    "for convenience , we refer to a knot with a @xmath24 decomposition as _",
    "one bridge with respect to a torus_. note that such knots are naturally tunnel one , see [ g ] .",
    "* we now develop the terminology that describes how these geometric concepts appear in the algebraic data .",
    "an element of the fundamental group of a link exterior is said to be _ meridional _ if there is a choice of basepoint so that the element is represented by a simple closed curve in the boundary .",
    "note that an element can be meridional and yet not lie in the fundamental group of the boundary of the knot , as exemplified by the two bridge knot and link exteriors .",
    "the fundamental group of a two bridge link can be generated by two meridional elements , both of which can not lie in the fundamental group of the boundary .",

    "remark : that a knot with a @xmath28 decomposition need not have a @xmath28 presentation is exemplified by the torus knots .",
    "however , as of this writing , no counterexample is known to the conjecture that a knot with a @xmath28 presentation has a @xmath28 decomposition .",

    "* the tunnel one satellite knots in @xmath17 were classified in 1988 by k.morimoto and h. sakuma in [ ms ] and the tunnel one satellite knots in general @xmath0-manifolds were classified in 1995 by j. neil [ n ] . per morimoto and sakuma s classification ,",
    "a satellite knot @xmath5 is tunnel one when it satisfies the following three conditions .",
    "first , the exterior of @xmath5 must be the union of a simple link exterior @xmath29 and a torus knot exterior @xmath30 .",
    "second , the link exterior @xmath29 must be attached to @xmath30 in a manner that takes a meridian of @xmath29 to the seifert fibre of @xmath30 .",
    "finally , the link exterior @xmath29 must embed in @xmath17 as the exterior of a @xmath1-bridge link other than the un- or hopf links .",
    "as can be seen from the construction , all the knots obtained in this manner are one bridge with respect to the torus knot s torus . see figure 2 where this is illustrated for the rolfsen - bailey knot , i.e. the one obtained by attaching the exterior of the two bridge link @xmath31 to the exterior of the left hand trefoil , as described above .",
    "it is interesting to note that m. eudave - munoz was able to recover this classification by first proving that a tunnel one satellite in @xmath17 has a @xmath24-decomposition , see [ e ] .",

    "are required :    given a fixed word @xmath127 as above , associate a series of integers to @xmath127 as in [ bj ] . in particular ,",
    "let @xmath179 denote the associated sequence @xmath180 .",
    "the integer @xmath181 denotes the number of times that the sequence @xmath179 changes algebraic sign .",
    "for example , if @xmath127 is the word @xmath182 , then the sequence @xmath179 is @xmath183 and the associated integer @xmath184 is @xmath1 .",
    "note that the relation @xmath185 holds .",
    "further , for each integer @xmath186 satisfying @xmath187 , let @xmath188 denote the length of the phrase @xmath189 .",

    "the  uncancelled \" length of the word @xmath127 is given by :      in what follows , assume that the integer @xmath148 is at least two .",
    "note that as the sequence @xmath179 proceeds from @xmath191 to @xmath192 , the phrase @xmath193 may admit cancellation or amalgamation as outlined below :    * @xmath194 * if both @xmath191 and @xmath192 are positive , the phrase @xmath195 may have cancellations and amalgamation . by 3.15 ,",
    "there are at most two cancellations and a single amalgamation yielding a maximal length reduction of five .",
    "note that in all cases the elements @xmath175 and @xmath173 can not generate any elements of length less than @xmath205 other than those elements of form @xmath206 .",

    "the normal form for the element @xmath173 can be written out and depends upon which of the four normal forms above the element @xmath2 has .",
    "since @xmath161 is an abelian group , we may assume for the purposes of working with @xmath170 that @xmath2 has normal form of type ii or type iv .",

    "the word @xmath127 has the following form :      with the possible exception of @xmath78 and @xmath129 , all integers @xmath130 are nonzero and no power of @xmath170 is trivial . for each of cases ii and iv , the phrase @xmath230 is examined for cancellation and or amalgamation :    * 3.15.2.1 . *",
    "if @xmath125 is a positive integer , writing out the phrase using @xmath231 instead of @xmath224 in case ii shows that there is an amalgamation in the elements @xmath232 , and no cancellation since the elements @xmath225 and @xmath226 are not inverses . in case iv",
    ", there is no cancellation or amalgamation of any kind .",
    "if @xmath125 is a negative integer , there is no amalgamation or cancellation in case ii . in case iv",
