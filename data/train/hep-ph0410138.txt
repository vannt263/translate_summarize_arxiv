    "advances in theoretical science are mostly based on finding useful and compact descriptions of a phenomenon of interest . understanding the nonperturbative dynamics of quarks and gluons inside the pion is a question too difficult to be addressed from first principles within qcd . in order to gain some insight into the nonperturbative physics of the qcd vacuum ,",
    "the concept of nonlocal condensates was introduced @xcite .    in this framework ,",
    "a simple and compact descriptor of the complex vacuum structure is provided by the average virtuality @xmath1 of vacuum quarks , whose inverse @xmath2 defines the correlation length of the scalar quark nonlocal condensate .",
    "the nonlocality parameter has been estimated using qcd sum rules @xcite and lattice calculations @xcite ; just recently @xcite it has been extracted from the data of the cleo collaboration @xcite on the pion - photon transition .",
    "one finds values in the range @xmath3 which pertain to a correlation length varying , respectively , between @xmath4  fm and @xmath5  fm , while the cleo data favors the value @xmath6",
    "gev@xmath7 @xcite and a correlation length of about @xmath8  fm .",
    "using qcd sum rules within this framework and a gaussian ansatz with the single parameter @xmath9 for the vacuum distributions , the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) was first derived in @xcite .",
    "later , this approach was refurbished and rectified @xcite , providing constraints on the first ten moments of the pion da and an estimate for the inverse moment using an _ independent _ sum rule . with recourse to the fast decrease of the moment values with its number @xmath10 , @xcite ,",
    "the gegenbauer coefficients of the pion da were calculated within uncertainty ranges and it was found that only the first two of them @xmath11 and @xmath12 are important ; the rest are negligible @xcite .",
    "this gives us a handy tool to reconstruct the pion distribution amplitude @xcite and calculate with it pion observables , like the pion - photon transition form factor @xmath13 @xcite and the electromagnetic form factor @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "confronting this pion da ( in terms of the first two gegenbauer coefficients ) with the constraints extracted from the cleo data @xcite via a best - fit analysis @xcite , it was found @xcite that it is within the @xmath15-error ellipse while the exclusion of the chernyak - zhitnitsky ( cz ) @xcite distribution amplitude at the @xmath16 level and of the asymptotic one at the @xmath17 level was reinforced .",

    "the pion da is a universal process - independent characteristic of the pion , explaining how the longitudinal momentum @xmath22 is partitioned between its two valence partons quark ( @xmath23 ) and antiquark ( @xmath24 ) , this being a reflection of the underlying nonperturbative dynamics . to leading twist-2",

    "the aim is to relate it with the nonperturbative qcd vacuum in terms of nonlocal condensates .",
    "this is achieved by relating the pion and its first resonance by means of a sum rule , based on the correlator of two axial currents : @xmath29 here the index @xmath30 runs over scalar ( s ) , vector ( v ) , and tensor ( t ) condensates , @xmath31 is the borel parameter , and @xmath32 is the duality interval in the axial channel , whereas @xmath33 is the spectral density in nlo perturbation theory @xcite . above , the dependence on the crucial non - locality parameter @xmath9 enters the sum rule in the way exemplified by the numerically important scalar - condensate contribution @xmath34         +   \\left(\\bar x\\rightarrow x\\right ) + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad\\quad         + \\theta(1>\\delta)\\theta\\left(\\delta >",

    "$ ] by virtue of the finiteness of @xmath9 , the sum rule ( [ eq : nlcsrda ] ) can supply us with constraints on the first ten moments @xmath42 of the pion da that are decreasing with increasing polynomial order to zero , i.e. , @xmath43 $ ] ( see fig .  [",

    "this task , though obviously of paramount importance is noted for its intransigence .",
    "however , the high - precision cleo data @xcite on the @xmath90 transition have improved the situation for the pion significantly .    indeed , schmedding and yakovlev ( sy ) @xcite",
    "have analyzed this data set using a further extension to the nlo ( of pqcd ) of the lcsr for the transition form factor @xmath91 , developed in @xcite .",

    "3 ) the recent results of @xcite ( ) and further extend our discussion of constraints on the gegenbauer coefficients . +      let us summarize the main findings of our analysis taking recourse to figures 3 .",
    "( i ) the asymptotic da and the cz model are excluded at @xmath17 and @xmath16 , respectively  as pointed out before by sy in @xcite .",
    "several other proposed model das , extracted , for instance , from instanton - based approaches @xcite , or from lattice calculations @xcite are also disfavored  at least at the level of @xmath93 , with the recently proposed model by ball and zwicky @xcite lying exactly on the boundary of the @xmath93 error `` ellipse '' .",
    "the important observation here is that only the bms `` bunch '' lies entirely inside the @xmath15 error area of the cleo data .",
    "a similar picture arises also for the inverse moment @xmath95 ( right side of fig .",
    "the light solid line inside the hatched band indicates the mean value of the sr estimate , @xmath96 , and its error bars correspondingly .",
    "the strip bounded by two almost vertical dash - dotted lines corresponds to the rather old braun ",
    "filyanov @xcite constraints : @xmath97 .",
    "( ii ) the extracted parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 were found to be rather sensitive to the strong radiative corrections and to the size of the twist-4 contribution .",
    "nevertheless , even assuming a twist-4 uncertainty of the order of @xmath80 , does not change these findings qualitatively .",
    "still , both @xmath100 and @xmath101 are outside the @xmath17 region with a slight improvement for the other models from @xmath17 to @xmath93 .",
    "( iii ) the correlation length in the qcd vacuum was extracted directly from the cleo data @xcite and found to be @xmath102  fm , i.e. , @xmath103  gev@xmath88 .",

    "as one sees , in both cases , the prediction for the bms `` bunch '' ( shaded strip ) is quite robust and in good agreement with both sets of data  even at relatively low @xmath81 values which exceed the validity of the theoretical framework applied .",

    "this new procedure replaces the running coupling and its powers by their analytic versions , each with its own dispersive image @xcite and provides results in rather good agreement with the experimental data @xcite , given also the large errors of the latter .",

    "@xmath120{fig - ffsum - dijet.eps}\\ ] ]",
    "we have discussed pion das , derived from nonlocal qcd sum rules that implement the idea of a nonzero vacuum correlation length , and extracted for this latter quantity a value around @xmath121  fm directly from the cleo data .",
    "the same set of experimental data offers the possibility to determine the gegenbauer coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 within restricted error regions . using a data processing , based on light - cone sum rules",
    ", we have shown that only the bms - like pion das lie within the @xmath15 region , while all other known models are excluded at least at @xmath93 or more .",
    "we have given theoretical predictions for the electromagnetic form factor using nlo analytic perturbation theory and shown that the same bms `` bunch '' of pion das provides results very close to those obtained with the asymptotic da .",
    "this agreement proves that whether or not the pion da is double - humped or single - peaked is much less relevant compared to its endpoint behavior . in the bms case ,",
    "the root cause for the excellent agreement with the cleo data is its strong endpoint suppression .",
    "these findings  gathered in table [ tab : pidasvsdata]are further backed up by the e791 data on diffractive di - jet production , albeit this set of data alone can not favor one da over the other .",
    "however , the fact that the middle region of @xmath23 where the `` bunch '' has its largest uncertainties is within this data range , provides independent credibility for this type of pion das putting it into a wider general context . finally , with the approved upgrade of the cebaf accelerator at jlab , planned to provide precision data for the pion s electromagnetic form factor up to @xmath122  gev@xmath7",
    ", we expect that the confrontation between theory and experiment will make a decisive step forwards .",
