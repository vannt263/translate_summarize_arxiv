    "recently great interest was addressed to the study of the correlation between the mass of nuclear supermassive black - holes ( @xmath0 ) and the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath1 ) of their hosting bulges .",
    "this relation has been obtained for nearby non - active galaxies by several authors @xcite , supporting the theory that the growth of the bh is bound to the galaxy formation . according to @xcite this correlation ,",
    "not set in primordial structures but fully established only at low redshift , can be understood if there is a simple linear relation between the total gas mass in galaxies and their @xmath0 .",
    "+ @xcite included in their sample seven active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and found that also these objects followed a similar @xmath4 correlation of non - active galaxies .",
    "other authors have then confirmed the validity of this result for samples of seyfert 1 galaxies ( s1s ) and quasars @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", no consensus has been reached until now about the case of the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) .",
    "these agns have spectroscopic properties slightly different from those of the classical s1s , as for example , narrower permitted emission lines in the optical wavelength domain and steeper power - law x - rays continua , which suggest that nls1s are hosting bhs with smaller masses accreting at high rates , close to the eddington limit .",
    "this hypotesis would imply that nls1s have also less massive bulges than classical s1s , of course assuming that their @xmath0 are correlated to the physical properties of their hosting bulges . indeed , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite found that there is no clear difference in the @xmath4 relation between narrow - line , broad - line agns and non - active nearby galaxies , while opposite results were obtained by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the main problem is that @xmath1 in agns is available for few s1s and only 3 nls1s : mrk  110 ( @xmath5 ) by @xcite , ngc  4051 ( @xmath6 ) by @xcite , and mrk  766 ( @xmath7 ) by @xcite . in place of @xmath1 , the [ oiii ] emission linewidth was extensively used as a representation of the bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "here we present new direct determinations of @xmath1 in the nuclei of 8 nls1 galaxies , obtained using the caii absorption triplet ( 8498 , 8542 , 8662  ) .",
    "the targets were extracted from @xcite , except for mrk  766 . in section 2",
    "we present the spectroscopic observations and the data reduction ; in section 3 we give a detailed description of the methods we used to measure stellar and gaseous kinematics , and we present the results .",
    "finally , in section 4 we discuss the implications of our results on the validity of the fwhm([oiii])/2.35=@xmath1 and @xmath4 relations for nls1 galaxies .",
    "we have observed the nuclei of 7 nls1s with the asiago faint object spectrograph camera ( afosc ) mounted at the 1.82 m telescope of the padova astronomical observatory ( asiago , italy ) .",
    "a volume phase holographic grism was used in combination with a 1.69 arcsec - slit to cover the region @xmath8 82009200  which includes the caii triplet absorption lines , with a dispersion of @xmath9  / px and a relatively high spectral resolution ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "mrk  766 was also observed in the optical wavelength range ( 43008000  ) at medium resolution , in order to derive the @xmath0 and [ oiii ] width information not availble in @xcite and useful for the following analysis .",
    "in addition to galaxy observations , the spectra of two template stars , hr  294 ( g9 iii ) and hd  11559 ( k0 iii ) , were obtained for kinematic analysis with the same configuration .",
    "two spectral types were chosen to minimize the template mismatch effects .",
    "mrk  896 was extracted from the isaac newton group ( ing ) archive . a spectrum covering a larger range ( @xmath8 77009400  )",
    "was obtained in august 1994 at the william herschel telescope ( canary islands , spain ) with isis double beam spectrograph .",
    "the r316r grating used in combination with a 1.47 arcsec - slit yielded a dispersion of @xmath8 1.35  / px and an instrumental resolution of @xmath8 65 .",
    "a standard star ( bd+17 4708 ) was observed during the same run for spectrophotometric calibration .",
    "the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "details about the observations are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "+ all data were reduced with the same procedure . the usual reduction steps ,",
    "that is bias and flat field corrections , cosmic rays removal , wavelength calibration by means of comparison lamps and sky - background subtraction , were carried out with iraf packages .",
    "the optical spectrum of mrk  766 was also flux calibrated through the observation of two spectrophotometric standard stars , feige56 and g191-b2b .",
    "for each object we extracted the nuclear spectrum summing a number of pixels along the slit to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) . an aperture of @xmath11 arcsec ( 7 px ) was chosen for the asiago data on the basis of the seeing , which ranged between 2 and 3 arcsec during the observations .",
    "this aperture corresponds to @xmath12 kpc for galaxies in the range @xmath13 . for the ing spectrum we used an aperture of 1.7 arcsec ( 5 px ) , corresponding to @xmath14 kpc , following similar arguments .",

    "their @xmath3}$ ] and m@xmath18 values are taken from literature .",
    "for mrk 766 we used our measurements , which are however in agreement with @xcite within the error bars .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that these new @xmath1 values fill a range more in agreement with the @xcite relation : @xmath21 , considering a mass range of @xmath22 for bhs in nls1 galaxies .",
    "in fact , after having plotted our data over the @xmath4 relation , we see that nls1s are well arranged around the tremaine et al .",
    "fit , and not sistematically below the fit as previously found . the data show a significant scatter around the fit , not very different from that observed in ordinary seyfert 1 galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , 5 out of 10 nls1s have a factor of 3 - 10 lower bh masses than predicted from the m@xmath23 relation .",
    "this would suggest that nls1s have a tendency to lower m@xmath18/@xmath1 ratios relative to non - active galaxies and broad - line agns , but the limited number of points does not allow to draw a conclusion about this point .",
    "several authors tested the m@xmath23 correlation validity for agns assuming that the gaseous component could reasonably trace the nuclear gravitational potential .",
    "in particular , the [ oiii ] width was used as surrogate of the stellar velocity dispersion , essentially for a practical reason : the [ oiii ] emission line is usually bright in agns and therefore easily measurable even in case of distant objects . on the contrary stellar absorptions",
    "require longer integration time and/or large telescopes to reach the s / n ratio necessary to give a reliable estimate of the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the fwhm([oiii ] ) to @xmath1 conversion was proposed by @xcite , who observed a large sample of agns in two spectral ranges , one including h@xmath19 , [ oiii ] emission lines and mg b triplet absorption , and the other containing the caii triplet absorption .",
    "the data of 66 objects were plotted showing a moderate correlation with a significant scatter .",
    "more recently @xcite obtained similar results on a sample of seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies , demonstrating that the majority of the galaxies form a cloud of points around the 1:1 line of the gas vs. stellar velocity dispersion plot , with very weak or even no correlation .",
    "none the less , the use of the [ oiii ] width in place of direct @xmath1 measurements led @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to demonstrate that seyfert 1 galaxies agree with the m@xmath23 relation given by @xcite , even if with a large scatter of @xmath1 ( from 50 to more than 500 ) , while nls1 galaxies do not . moreover ,",
    "nls1s appear sistematically arranged below the tremaine et al .",
    "interestingly , this result was already included in @xcite , who carried out an analysis of the @xmath0[oiii ] @xmath245007 width relation for 107 low ",
    "redshift radio  quiet qsos and seyfert 1 galaxies and found that this correlation is real , but the scatter is large , about 0.2 dex .",
    "really , it is easy to verify that the narrow line agns ( fwhm(h@xmath25 ) of his sample are mostly located below the tremaine et al . fit .",
    "therefore , authors were induced to believe that nls1s do not follow the bh - bulge correlation as seyefert 1 , quasars and normal galaxies .",
    "but , very recently , @xcite obtained a good consistency in bh mass estimates of nls1 galaxies by using h@xmath19 and soft x - ray luminosity , while no agreement was found with the [ oiii ] linewidth .",
    "their result casts doubt on the reliability of [ oiii ] as indicator of stellar velocity dispersion , at least for nls1s . and",
    ", indeed it should be mentioned that the fwhm([oiii])/2.35=@xmath1 relation was obtained by @xcite for a sample of seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies , but it was never verified for nls1s .",
    "the situation clearly required new direct @xmath1 measurements .",
    "we obtained these values for 8 nls1s observing their caii triplet .",
    "the choice of this spectral range was induced by the fact that nls1s are very often characterized by large feii emission multiplets ( 44004700    and 51505350  ) in correspondence of the absorption lines commonly used to estimate @xmath1 , like mg i @xmath245175 and fe i @xmath245269 . unfortunately , as shown by @xcite , nls1s with strong feii are likely to have caii in emission rather than in absorption .    by comparing stellar and gaseous kinematics we found that the fwhm([oiii ] ) /2.35=@xmath1 relation does not seem to hold for nls1s , which are arranged mostly at values of @xmath3}$ ] larger than expected .",
    "contrary to the recent findings , the direct @xmath1 measurements span a narrower range typically lower than 100 , and such range is in agreement with the stellar velocity dispersions expected by the @xmath4 relation given by @xcite in case of @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , with our @xmath1 determinations , nls1s are arranged around this relationship , suggesting that in nls1 galaxies bh and bulge correlate , and lower mass bhs correspond to lower stellar velocity dispersions , or in other words lower mass bulges .",
    "we stress that this result is in agreement with our previous work @xcite , where we showed that nls1s are mostly confined to the lower ranges of the m@xmath18-l@xmath27 plane , and are well correlated to seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars .",
    "the fact that the stellar velocity dispersion in place of the gaseous one yields a tighter relation when correlated with bh mass , is essentially caused by the star kinematics which is more representative of the bulge gravitational potential than the gas in agns . even if the gas motion is mainly controlled by the mass of the bulge ,",
    "several observations in the past showed that the base of the line profiles emitted by the narrow line region ( nlr ) in many active galaxies is hardly reproduced simply assuming a pure virial motion in the potential of the host galaxy ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "other important factors or processes can be involved , and these additional processes can be at the origin of the larger scatter observed when the fwhm([o iii ] ) is used as surrogate of @xmath1 .",
    "the interaction bewteen the gas and the ejected radio plasma observed in many seyfert galaxies may strongly influence the gas kinematics and contribute with outflowing motions of the nlr clouds @xcite .",
    "moreover , supersonic winds generated by the active nucleus are believed to accelerate the smaller clouds of the nlr located closer to the central engine and sometimes dominate their virial velocity @xcite .",
    "this effect could be more important in nls1 galaxies , since strong nuclear winds are expected in case of high accretion rates @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was pointed out by @xcite that a slight tendency exists for barred and/or disturbed active galaxies to have broader [ oiii ] emission lines . in conclusion",
    ", we obtained results with important implications , which strongly encourage additional observations to enlarge the sample of the observed galaxies .",
    "we are very grateful to the referee for precious comments which improved the quality of the paper .",
    "this research was partially based on data from the ing archive ."
