    "nevertheless , the sm is not considered as the ultimate theory since neither the fundamental parameters , masses and couplings , nor the symmetry pattern are predicted . even though many aspects of the sm are experimentally supported to a very accuracy ,",
    "the embedding of the model into a more general framework is to be expected .",
    "some of these possibilities is that , at energies of a few tevs , the gauge symmetry may be @xmath1 ( 3 - 3 - 1 for shortness ) @xcite . recently , the supersymmetric version of these model have alreday benn constructed in @xcite .",
    "these 3 - 3 - 1 models can be embedded in a model with 3 - 4 - 1 , its mean @xmath2 gauge symmetry @xcite .    in @xmath3 , the most general expression for the electric charge generator is a linear combination of the four diagonal generators of the gauge group @xmath4 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "therefore , there is an infinite number of models can , in principle , be constructed .    a model with the @xmath13 symmetry in the lepton sector , quarks were not considered on this work ,",
    "was suggested some years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite , in wchich the magnetic moment of neutrinos arises as the result of charged scalars that belong to an @xmath14 sextet , and the mass of neutrino arises at two - loop level as the result of electroweak radiative correction .    the 3 - 4 - 1 model in ref .",
    "@xcite contain exotic electric charges only in the quark sector , while leptons have ordinary electric charges and gauge bosons have integer electric charges .",
    "the best feature of this model is that it provides us with an alternative to the problem of the number @xmath15 of fermion families .",
    "these sort of models are anomaly free only if there are equal number of quadriplet and anti - quadriplet ( considering the color degrees of freedom ) , and furthermore requiring the sum of all fermion charges to vanish .",
    "two of the three quark generations transform identically and one generation , it does not matter which one , transforms in a different representation of @xmath16 .",
    "this means that in these models as in the @xmath17 ones  @xcite , in order to cancel anomalies , the number of families @xmath18 must be divisible by the number of color degrees of freedom ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this fact , together with asymptotic freedom in qcd , the model predicts that the number of generations must be three and only three .    on the other hand , at low energies",
