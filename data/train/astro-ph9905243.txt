    "it was realized a few years ago ( anosova & orlov 1991 ) that the multiple system ads  6175 , which contains three spectroscopic binaries ( castor a , castor b and yy gem ) , could be just the most prominent members of a moving group .",
    "this moving group would include about 18 stars , having spectral types between a1  v and m6  ve , including one of the prototypes of the @xmath1 pic stars .",
    "the @xmath1 pic type stars show ir excesses , which are associated the the presence of circumstellar dusty disks .",
    "the prototypes for this class of stars are @xmath1 pic , vega and fomalhaut . as a result of their proximity and brightness",
    ", these three stars have been studied in great detail , and estimates of the mass , radial distribution and structure , dust - grain properties of their disks have been made ( e.g. , backman & paresce 1993 ) .",
    "it is generally believed that these circumstellar dusty disks are either the direct descendents of t tauri disks or the secondary products of the planet formation process .",
    "knowledge of the ages of @xmath1 pic stars is therefore one of the keys to understand the formation and evolution of their disks .",
    "however , there is only a handful of estimates of the ages of these systems , and no member of this class has yet been detected with certainty in an open cluster ( although see backman , angelova & stauffer 1998 ) .",
    "all three prototypes are a stars , and estimates from their post - zams evolution give approximate ages of 100 , 200 , and 400 myr for @xmath1 pic , fomalhaut and vega , respectively ( backman and paresce 1993 ) . recently , barrado y navascus et al .",
    "( 1997a ) estimated an age of 200@xmath2100 my .",
    "for fomalhaut , based on a number of properties ( x - ray emission , rotation , lithium abundance , isochrones ) of its physical companion gl879 .",
    "another relevant star belonging to this class , hr4796a , has been studied in a similar way by stauffer et al .",
    "these authors derived an age of 8@xmath22 myr . lately , holland et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have imaged the thermal emission from the disks of the three prototypes at submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "they concluded that any earth  like planet must have already formed .",
    "moreover , the central holes found by holland et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in the orbit of fomalhaut and by jayawardhana et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and koerner et al . (",
    "1998 ) in the case of hr4796a , support the idea of the early formation of planets .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the proper motions of several nearby stars . based on hipparcos data ,",
    "we show that , indeed , castor shares its galactic motion with other stars , including fomalhaut and vega and several late spectral type stars .",
    "this fact allows us to derive the age of the group .",
    "a few years ago , barrado y navascus et al . ( 1997a ) determined the age of one of the prototypes of the @xmath1 pic class , fomalhaut , based on the properties of a physical late spectral type companion , gl879 .",
    "they noted that anosova & orlov ( 1991 ) had suggested that both stars could be part of a moving group which would include castor a@xmath3b and yy gem .",
    "however , uncertainties at that time were too large to derive any firm conclusion .",
    "the wealth of data obtained by hipparcos allows a more precise determination of distances , positions , and proper motions .",
    "using these new values , we have recomputed the galactic velocities for the anosova & orlov ( 1991 ) sample , to try to verify whether there is a moving group or not .",
    "in addition to the 18 possible members studied by anosova & orlov ( 1991 ) , we have included several stars from two different sources .",
    "the first source provides the kinematics of several types of cool dwarfs in the solar neighborhood ( soderblom 1990 ) .",
    "the second source is a large study which searched for kinematic groups in the solar neighborhood ( agekyan & orlov 1984 ) .",
    "these latter authors computed the galactic velocities for more than 1,000 stars selected from the gliese catalog , and suggested the existence of several moving groups .",
    "from these two sources , we have selected a total of 26 stars , and we have re - analyzed their kinematic properties .",
    "table 1 lists our sample of stars .",
    "the first column contains the common name for well known stars , whereas the other three columns provide the numbers in the gliese , hd and hipparcos / tycho catalogs , respectively .",
    "a color - magnitude diagram of the whole sample is shown in figure 1 , where the absolute visual magnitude is plotted versus the ( b  v ) color index . a schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) zero age main sequence ( zams )",
    "is also included as a solid line .",
    "the group includes eight a stars with different levels of ir emission , as well as five df , two dg , three dk and seven dm .",
    "note that we have not performed a systematic search for possible members ( either using the whole gliese catalog or taking advantage of the hipparcos database ) and , therefore , our sample is not complete and may be biased .",
    "table 2 contains additional information about the sample .",
    "we list the apparent and absolute visual magnitudes , ( b  v ) and ( v  i ) cousin colors and , when available , the equivalent width of h@xmath0 ew(h@xmath0) , x - ray luminosity and lithium abundance .",
    "based on the positions , parallaxes , and proper motions provided by the hipparcos database , and the radial velocities ( simbad database and references therein ) , we have computed the kinematic properties of our sample of stars .",
    "table 3 shows the numbers in the gliese catalog , the positions , parallaxes , proper motions , radial velocities , and the galactic velocities ( u , v and w ) , with their associated errors for all these quantities . galactic velocities and errors were computed following the description provided by johnson & soderblom ( 1987 ) and follow the right - handed coordinate system ( positive toward the galactic center , galactic rotation and north galactic pole ) .",
    "since the time span for the hipparcos mission was short , the proper motions based on hipparcos data might be not accurate .",
    "for this reason , we have also computed the galactic velocities using the proper motion values from the ppm ( roeser & bastian 1988 ; bastian & roeser 1993 ; roeser & bastian 1994 ) , and the hipparcos positions and parallaxes . except in very few cases ( e.g. gl351 , gl521.2 , castor itself )",
    ", the discrepancies do not affect the conclusions .",
    "however , we note that the differences between the hipparcos and the ppm proper motions differ by more than the quoted uncertainties for all stars in the sample .",
    "narayanan & gould ( 1998 ) have shown that hipparcos proper motions are consistent with its parallaxes ( at least in the direction toward the hyades ) , an indication that there are not systematics errors due to the short baseline .",
    "the derived v component of the galactic velocities also differ by more than the nominal uncertainties in 30% of the sample .",
    "this fact indicates that some stars catalogued as members of the moving group could be spurious members .",
    "we have made a special effort to use the most accurate radial velocities .",
    "primarily , we selected the values from the web catalog ( duflot et al .",
    "1995 ) , a compilation of three different works ( wilson 1963 ; evans 1978 ; batten et al .",
    "we also provide other values quoted in the literature . only in three cases ( gl426 , gl564.1 and gl842.2 ) , there are disagreements between these values . for gl426 and gl842.2 , the kinematics and other information seem to indicate that they are not associated with the moving group . the case of gl564.1",
    "is discussed below .",
    "figures 2a and 2b allow us to identify possible members based on their kinematic properties ( v against u and w , respectively , from hipparcos data ) .",
    "soderblom & mayor ( 1993 ) pointed out that the components of a stellar kinematic group must have the same motion in the direction of the galactic rotation ( the v component ) .",
    "visual inspection indicates that the velocities are clustered around ( -10,-8,-10 ) .",
    "the dispersions of these velocities are rather small , in particular for the the 7 a spectral type stars ( note that castor is itself composed of two pairs of spectroscopic binaries , but we have counted them as one star ) .",
    "however , there are several stars which have velocities in disagreement with these average values .    in particular , the galactic velocities ( specifically , using the v component as a criterion ) seem to indicate that gl426ab , gl466 and gl696 are probable non - members of the moving group , and that gl803 and gl842.2 are possible non - members ( indicated with the labels `` n '' and `` n ? '' in the second column of table 4 ) .",
    "the table also indicates if the stars are probable or possible members ( `` y '' and `` y ? '' , respectively ) .",
    "gl564.1 ( @xmath0@xmath4 lib ) deserves special attention .",
    "it is physically associated to gl563.4 ( poveda et al .",
    "the web value of the radial velocities of both stars leads to a a similar value of the v component of the galactic velocity , but poveda et al .",
    "( 1994 ) provide a radial velocity in large disagreement with the web value .",
    "we have preferred to keep this last value .",
    "on the other hand , the u component of the velocity of gl563.4 is quite different from the average of the group .",
    "the only relevant difference between both stars is the radial velocity and this could be due to the orbital motion as well as to uncertainties in the measured values .",
    "therefore , we do not rule out the possibility that it indeed belongs to the moving group .",
    "figure 3c displays the velocities computed with the ppm data .",
    "the agreement in the kinematics of these stars also suggest a common origin . however , when computed from the ppm values , castor has a v component of the velocity quite different from the average of the moving group , with a difference much larger than the quoted uncertainties",
    ". therefore , it would be possible that these system would not be a member of the moving group ( and the association should be called vega moving group ) .",
    "in fact , if a very restricted definition would be used , this figure indicates that there could be 2 different groups ; one including vega , fomalhaut and @xmath5 phe and another with 14 lep and @xmath6 lib .",
    "alderamin could be in either of them , due to its large error bars .",
    "however , the data based on hipparcos and the evidences provided below seem to indicate that , indeed , all of them share a common origin .      further information on the membership can be obtained from color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "figure 3a displays the absolute visual magnitude against the ( b  v ) color , whereas figure 3b has ( v  i)@xmath7 in the x - axis .",
    "the initial sample of late spectral type stars are shown as circles .",
    "filled symbols indicate final members and open symbols those stars rejected as physically associated ( see section 3.4 ) .",
    "both figures include the dantona and mazzitelli ( 1994 ) isochrones for the ages 3 , 10 , 35 and 70 myr ( top to bottom , dashed lines ) .",
    "the solid line is the zams .",
    "details concerning the convertion between theoretical values ( t@xmath8 and luminosity ) and the observational plane can be found in stauffer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and barrado y navascus et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "we have selected those stars located below the 35 myr isochrone and above the zams as possible members and indicated this in the third and fourth columns of table 4 .",
    "figure 4 compares the equivalent width of h@xmath0 for our sample of stars ( filled circles ) with the hyades ( open circles ) .",
    "this graph can be used to support rejection of several candidates or to accept them as members : gl696 presents a minimum value in its h@xmath0 absorption ( it is a very inactive star ) , so it seems to be older than the hyades and a non - member of the moving group .",
    "gl896a , gl896b and gl803 are very active stars .",
    "their activity is similar to the most active hyades stars , and indication that they could be younger .",
    "however , barrado y navascus et al .",
    "1998 ) have shown that some dm praesepe stars have larger activity than equivalent hyades stars ( both clusters are coeval ) .",
    "therefore , these stars could be as old as 600 - 800 myr .",
    "the spectroscopic binary yy gem is a by dra system , whose rotational period is synchronized with its orbital one , phenomenon which produces an enhanced stellar activity , not related with the age of the system .",
    "its location on the plot can not provide any information about its membership to the moving group .",
    "similar conclusions can be reached if the coronal activities are compared .",
    "we have combined the information provided by the kinematics and the cmd to select a list of members .",
    "we have also taken into account the lithium abundance and the h@xmath0 equivalent width when that information is available .",
    "we find that there is a good agreement between these criteria ( if the kinematics are different from the average value , then the location in the cmd usually desagree with membership ) .",
    "column six in table 4 provides our final classification for the membership .",
    "the hotter stars are classified as members based only on the kinematic .",
    "however , they are relatively young , and the probability of having several stars of a spectral type , leaving the main sequence , with the same spatial velocity , and not having been born at the same time , is quite low .",
    "we have a total of 16 probable members and another star which could be part of the group ( @xmath0@xmath9 lib ) .      a significant fraction of the stars studied here fulfill the soderblom & mayor ( 1993 ) definition of a stellar kinematic group .",
    "the most restrictive requirement is that of having identical v component of the galactic velocity . in our case",
    ", there are 8 stars with v within 1 sigma of the average of the final members .",
    "this group includes castor , vega and fomalhaut .",
    "although we do not rule out the possibility of having a spurious kinematic group , we believe that the data presented here provide strong indications for a common origin of , at least , the majority of the sample .",
    "however , the membership of individual stars can not be known without doubt .",
    "in fact , whitmire et al .",
    "( 1992 ) studied the kinematics of several a stars in the solar vicinity , including several stars in common with our study , namely , gl20 , gl217.1 , gl278 , gl564.1 , gl721 , gl826 and gl881 .",
    "although they discussed the possibility of a common origin for several of these stars , they concluded that the small velocity dispersion is due to an observational selection .",
    "their model implies an interaction with an interstellar cloud , a phenomenon which could enhance the circumstellar disks . however ,",
    "not all a stars in our sample display ir excesses , a subproduct of the disks . in any case , some caveats about particular membership should be kept in mind .",
    "palou@xmath10 & piskunov ( 1985 ) have shown that there is a relation between the kinematic properties and the age of b and a stars . based on their table 3",
    ", it is possible to constrain the age of the hot members of the castor moving group .",
    "they have average values of the velocities of @xmath11u@xmath12=10.7@xmath23.5 , @xmath11v@xmath12=8.0@xmath22.4 and @xmath11w@xmath12=9.7@xmath23.0 km / s , leading to ages of 100400 , 200 - 600 and 50 - 100 myr , respectively . these ages are indicative , since the velocity dispersion components in the palou@xmath10 & piskunov ( 1985 ) study are quite large and , in the last case , the w component of the velocity of the castor group is slightly out the range of velocities examined by palou@xmath10 & piskunov ( 1985 )",
    ". a combined age would be 100 - 400 myr , in good agreement with the values derived for the late spectral type stars ( see below ) .",
    "figures 3a and 3b can provide an estimate of the age of the association .",
    "the final set of members lies below the 35 myr isochrone and above the 70 myr .",
    "both the proximity to the zams and the unknown metallicity of the group do not allow an accurate determination of the age .",
    "however , it seems that these stars are clearly above the zams .",
    "then , they would be premain sequence ( pms ) objects , still approaching at the ms .",
    "we believe that due to the errors in the conversion from the theoretical plane to observational plane , together with the errors associated with the observational data ( very small in most cases ) , the two color - magnitude diagrams put only a lower limit to the age , of 35 myr .    on the other hand , the hotter real members of the moving group should be close to the end of their lives in the main sequence ( in particular , castor a and b , and @xmath0@xmath4  lib ) .",
    "this particular evolutionary status allows for the possibility of isochrone fit .",
    "again , uncertainties in the individual actual distances negligible , see table 3 , magnitudes and colors are too large to provide accurate ages . backman & paresce ( 1993 ) , by fitting isochrones , derived ages close to 400 and 200 myr for vega and fomalhaut , respectively , with uncertainties of 30% . for our data",
    "set , we use meynet et al .",
    "( 1993 ) set of evolutionary tracks .",
    "we find that fomalhaut is too close to the ms to fit an isochrone .",
    "the location of vega , hotter than fomalhaut , in the cmd is completely compatible with the turn - off position of the open cluster ngc  6494 , and provides an age close to 300 myr . in any case",
    ", it seems that at least some stars , including the castor system , yy  gem , fomalhaut and gl  879 , are physically associated and , for this reason , they have the same age .",
    "the common origin and age of these stars would have important implications .",
    "in particular , yy gem , an eclipsing binary , is one of the two m dwarfs with accurate measurements of radii and temperatures .",
    "chabrier & baraffe ( 1995 ) , using new evolutionary models , fit isochrones to both components of the system ( either in the radii - mass or the t@xmath8-mass planes ) , and concluded that the system has to be on the late pre - main sequence contraction phase .",
    "they estimated an age of @xmath13100 myr .",
    "we note that if it is really slightly a pms system , then it should not be used as a calibrator of theoretical models ( unless one can accurately correct for its pms nature or accurately know its age ) .",
    "the lithium abundance of late spectral type stars can be used as a membership criterion , as well as a statistical method to estimate the age of an association of stars , since the lithium abundance depends on both age and mass ( e.g. , balachandran 1994 ) .",
    "figures 5a and 5b depict the abundance against the effective temperature for those stars with published values ( crosses ) . in the first case ( fig .",
    "5a ) , we have included data corresponding to hyades stars ( filled circles ) and pleiades stars ( open circles ) .",
    "these two clusters have standard ages of 600 - 800 and 70 - 80 myr , respectively ( see stauffer et al .",
    "1998 for a new determination of the age of the pleiades , which yields 125@xmath25 myr , based on the position of the lithium boundary for very low mass stars and brown dwarfs ) .",
    "the second figure contains data from the m34 cluster ( open circles ) and the uma moving group ( filled circles ) , which are 200 and 300 myr old , respectively .",
    "figure 5b also includes a 300 myr lithium depletion isochrone from chaboyer ( 1993 ) .",
    "the sources of the lithium data for all four associations can be found in barrado y navascus et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .    the comparison between the lithium abundances of cluster stars of different ages and gl879 , a physical companion of fomalhaut , was used by barrado",
    "y navascus et al .",
    "( 1997a ) to establish that these stars are younger than 300 myr , probably in the range 100 - 300 myr .",
    "figure 5a and 5b indicates that the lithium abundance of @xmath14 lib is compatible with this age ( see our caveats about the membership based on the kinematic , section 3.5 ) .",
    "gl848 seems too old to be part of the of the moving group , whereas gl896a is too young .",
    "the case of yy gem is more complex .",
    "it is well known that it is a very close sb2 eclipsing binary .",
    "its rapid rotation ( v  sini=40 kms@xmath15 ) causes significant for the important spectral line blending .",
    "moreover , since the system is composed of 2 similar stars ( m=0.62 and 0.57 m@xmath16 , bopp 1974 ) , lines arising from both components appear in the spectrum . for the particular observation used to derive the lithium abundance ( phase=0.21 , barrado y navascus 1996 ) , the lii6708.8  doublets of each component were well detached .",
    "the final abundance is log n(li)=0.02@xmath20.20 , in the customary scale where log n(h)=12 .",
    "however , close binaries in clusters ( barrado y navascus & stauffer 1996 in the case of hyades , and ryan & deliyannis 1995 in the case of m67 ) and chromospherically active binaries , such as yy gem ( barrado y navascus et al .",
    "1997b ) inhibit partially the lithium depletion , probably due to mixing related to rotation . therefore",
    ", this binary is not a good candidate to be used to estimate the age of the castor moving group , although it is very well established that there is a physical connection between these stars",
    ".      all these comparisons , which are compatible with the well determined age of gl879 and fomalhaut , allows us to conclude that , indeed , the castor moving group has an age of 200@xmath2100 myr .",
    "note that at this point , we have assumed that the stellar kinematic group is real and that these stars are members of it .",
    "however , as mentioned before , the group , as found in open clusters , could contain spurious members , and even the possibility of having a sample with the same kinematic properties and compatible cmd and a different origin can not be rejected .",
    "if these stars do have a common origin , as it seems , the same age derived for them is a very relevant fact , since the group has several a stars with different infrared excesses ( or none at all ) , indicating that , at least at this age , the evolution of the protoplanetary disks does not depend on their age .",
    "we have used data provided by hipparcos to select several stars as possible members of the castor moving group .",
    "additional information , such as the position in color - magnitude diagrams , isochrones , lithium abundances , stellar activity , was used to add new constraints to the membership and to estimate the age of the association , which is 200@xmath2100 myr .",
    "the moving group contains seven a spectral type stars with different ir excesses .",
    "this fact could indicate that , at this stage , the evolution of these excesses , when present , does not depend on age , and that , therefore , the time scale of the formation of planetary does not seem to be universal .",
