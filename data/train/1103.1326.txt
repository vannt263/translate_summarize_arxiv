    "over the past few years there has been considerable interest in the dynamics of cavity polaritons in low - dimensional inorganic microcavities .",
    "@xcite in the strong coupling regime , where the photon - exciton interaction is larger than the exciton and photon damping rates , photons within the cavity and excitons within the material become coherently coupled to form bosonic quasi - particles termed `` polaritons '' .",
    "@xcite macroscopic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) states have recently been reported in gaas and in cdtd / cdmgte microcavities@xcite and recent reports give evidence of polariton condensation in one - dimensional zno microwires .",
    "@xcite    polaritons obey a dispersion relation that splits into two branches with an avoided crossing near the intersection of the cavity dispersion and the exciton resonance frequency . in a typical inorganic quantum - well semiconductor microcavity ,",
    "the rabi splitting between wannier - mott excitons and the cavity modes is typically on the order of 10 mev .",
    "however , for organic systems ( with frenkel excitons ) exciton oscillator strengths are considerably higher than their inorganic counterparts and consequently the rabi splittings can be on the order of 100 mev . @xcite",
    "while polariton lasing has been reported in organic microcavities,@xcite thus far , polariton bec has not been in these systems .",
    "this paper is also motivated by the recent reports of bec of a two - dimensional photon gas in a dye - filled optical microcavity.@xcite in these experiments , the strong coupling requirement is not met and the quasi - particles within the cavity are indeed best described as photons rather than polaritons .    in this paper , we consider the preparation and dynamics of bec states in an organic microcavity consisting of an acene thin - film sandwiched within a microcavity of thickness @xmath0 . to date , the evidence for bec has not been reported in organic semiconductor microcavity systems .",
    "whereas in inorganic systems , the electronic states are best described as wannier excitons with weakly bound electron - hole pairs , in organic semiconductors the excitons are frenkel excitons that are largely localized on a single molecular unit .",
    "consequently , their electronic transition moments are generally larger compared to inorganic systems resulting stronger coupling to the photon field and consequently larger rabi splittings",

    "while bec in atomic systems involves weakly interacting particles , these systems are not uniform since the condensate is influenced by the form of the trapping potential .",
    "while liquid @xmath2he , for example , is also a bec condensate , perturbative treatments can not be used on this system due to strong inter - particle interactions and correlations .",
    "consequently , polaritons offer a unique glimpse into bec physics since the shape of the condensate state itself is _ unambiguous _ for a uniform system .",
    "the specific signature of a bec state in the form of a spontaneous coherence offers a unique opportunity to study localization effects in two - dimensional systems with varying degrees of spatial disorder .    in a cavity system ,",
    "the disorder can be introduced either by speckles within the optical field , by the orientational disorder of the molecular sites , or by site - energy disorder within a perfectly periodic crystal structure .",
    "the role of disorder is an interesting issue since it would allow one to probe indirectly at least the transition between the superfluid and mott insulating regime .",
    "there has been some speculation that a bose - glass phase is intermediate between the superfluid and mott insulating phases implying that disorder transforms the mott insulting phase to a bose - glass . however , other theories suggest that disorder can change the mott insulating phase directly to a superfluid .",
    "recent experimental evidence involving trapped atoms indicate the transition is disorder - induced and reversible for superfluid and coexisting superfluid - mott insulator phases .",
    "furthermore , spatial disorder plays a key role in the fractional quantum hall effect and vortex pinning in type - ii superconductors .",
    "our analysis begins with a molecular - level description of a single layer of polyacene molecules in which the local electronic excitations are described within the frenkel exciton model with dipole - dipole couplings determined by quantum chemistry .",
    "the local excitons interact with a single mode of the photon field within the dipole approximation and we determine the polariton dispersion curves by diagonalizing the full exciton+photon hamiltionian for a given configuration of the lattice molecules .",
    "this treatment allows us to take an arbitrary configuration of the molecules within the lattice and generate polariton dispersions . in sec .",
    "iii we adopt a field - theoretical approach developed by carusotto and ciuti which treats the cavity as a non - equilibrium steady - state system .",
    "@xcite this allows us to identify steady - state polaritons as parameterized by the intensity of the driving field .",
    "we then use the bogoliubov prescription to separate fluctuations from the stationary solution and use this to determine the excitation spectra for the lower polariton branch .",
    "we then consider the response of the system to inhomogeneous perturbations within the cavity and show that above a threshold intensity for the driving field , the scattering signal collapses to a single point indicating the onset of superfluidity .",
    "the cut - off temperature for the amplification is ultimately determined by the binding energy of the exciton . because this is large in organic semiconductors ( hundreds of mev ) , parametric amplification should be readily observable at significantly higher temperatures than in inorganic quantum - well microcavities , even at room temperature .",
    "polaritons are composite quasi - particles that form due to the strong coupling between excitons and the radiation field .",

    "the hamiltonian describing the coupled exciton / photon system is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the rabi frequency which depends upon the number of photons in a given mode @xmath8 , the oscillator strength of the transition , and the orientation of the excitation s transition moment relative to the polarization of the photon .",

    "this can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 are transition moments for the @xmath37 electronic transition on a given site and @xmath38 is the vector connecting the centers of molecules @xmath32 and @xmath39 .",

    "the model used here has been used in a variety of contexts , notably by agranovich and gartstein in their recent study of low - energy exciton - polaritons in one - dimensional systems .",
    "@xcite the site - model is particularly attractive since it allows us to parameterize it using both spectroscopic and quantum - chemical information about a specific molecular system .",
    "one should , in principle , add to our model the fact that the excitons are composite quasi - particles consisting of bound electron / hole pairs . for organic systems ,",
    "the exciton binding energy is in the range of @xmath43 to @xmath44ev and the electron and hole largely reside on the same molecular site , which justifies the use of the frenkel exciton model for these systems .",
    "@xcite an important feature which we do neglect , however , is the coupling between the local site exciton and the internal vibrational motions of the molecule itself . in organic systems ,",
    "such vibronic couplings play important roles in the spectroscopy and dynamics of conjugated systems.@xcite    since we are interested in polaritons in molecular crystals , we need to consider how the crystallographic arrangement and possible molecular disorder will affect the formation of polariton states within such a system . with this in mind",
    "we consider an ordered 2d array of acene molecules within a microcavity . at 290 k ,",
    "polyacene systems typically form monoclinic crystals with two molecules per unit cell in the plane containing the molecular @xmath45 axis oriented alternately @xmath46 from the crystallographic @xmath47 direction . when viewed from above the plane , we see the `` herringbone '' packing geometry characteristic of polyacene molecular crystals . the electronic transition moment for the @xmath37 transition lies along the molecular @xmath45 axes and hence lies in a plane parallel to the reflectors .",
    "consider the case of a molecular dimer ( such as two polyacenes ) interacting with a photon field where we let @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote exciton operators for one monomer and @xmath50 and @xmath51 be exciton operators for the other with the exchange interaction denoted by @xmath52 . in the `` local '' @xmath53 basis ,",
    "we can write @xmath54 taking @xmath55 , @xmath56 can be brought into block - diagonal form by creating davydov exciton states via @xmath57 which results in @xmath58 taking the transition moments parallel in the same plane where @xmath59 is the angle between the transition moment and the centers of the two molecules , i.e. @xmath60 , the exchange coupling is given by @xmath61 for @xmath62 , @xmath63 and the dimers form a j - aggregate while for angles @xmath64 , @xmath65 and the dimers form an h aggregate . at @xmath66 , the exchange coupling vanishes and no exciton splitting occurs .",
    "we now note that only the _ symmetric _ davydov state is coupled to the photon field and we can use a unitary transformation to define the upper and lower polariton branches @xmath67 where the mixing angle is given by @xmath68 where the @xmath14 and @xmath15 operators are quasi - particle operators which create polaritons in the upper ( u ) or lower ( l ) branches with dispersion @xmath69 consequently , for a molecular dimer , we have three states : the upper and lower polarition states and a dark exciton state .",
    "the relative ordering of the exciton energy levels depends upon the sign of @xmath52 , which in turn depends upon angle between the co - facial stacking planes . for j - aggregates , @xmath63 the bright state is lower in energy than the dark state where as for h - aggregates @xmath65 and the dark exciton state is lower in energy . in fig .",
    "[ aggs ] we compare the dispersion curves for a molecular dimer taken as a j - aggregate with @xmath70 and an h - aggregate ( @xmath71 ) .",

    "aggregate , the lower davydov state carries a net coupling to the photon mode and the lower polariton branch is formed solely by coupling to this state .",
    "the upper davydov state does not contribute the formation of polaritons .",
    "the situation is exactly reversed for the h - aggregates in that only the upper davydov state is coupled to the photon field .",
    "this basic idea can be expanded to describe the full 2d slab in two ways .",
    "first , we can write the transition moment for the unit cell by taking the vector sum and differences @xmath76 of the molecular transition moments within the cell . this results in transition moments @xmath77 which are orthogonal and directed along the @xmath78 and @xmath47 crystallographic axes .",
    "thus , taking the dipole - dipole coupling to be short ranged so that only neighboring cells are coupled , the exciton dispersion can be written as @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are computed using @xmath82 and @xmath83 where @xmath78 and @xmath47 are the lattice constants . for anthracene : @xmath84  and @xmath85  are the lattice constants for the planar array shown in fig .",
    "since the wavevector @xmath8 refers to the wavevector in the lattice plane , this dispersion is flat compared to the dispersion for the cavity photons and one can immediately extend eq .",
    "[ davidov - polariton ] for the 2d lattice .",
    "a more realistic approach is to include orientational and energetic disorder directly into the model and obtain polariton states by numerical diagonalisation . in the calculations presented next , each molecular site",
    "is described by a transition moment @xmath86 corresponding to an oscillator strength of @xmath87 as determined by _ ab initio _ ( cis/6 - 31 g * ) calculations on an isolated anthracene molecule using gaussian 03.@xcite rather than using the _ ab initio _ vertical excitation energy for anthracene , we set the site excitation energy as @xmath88 . in the end , this value simply establishes a reference point and all excitations and energies can be re - scaled relative to the vertical exciton energy for purposed of comparison with experiments .",
    "each dipole is located at the crystallographic site and oriented alternately @xmath46 from the crystallographic @xmath47 direction .",
    "this coupling gives rise to exciton couplings of @xmath89mev between the two acenes within the unit cell .",
    "we also assume a static dielectric constant of @xmath90 , a value typical for organic solids .",
    "finally , we model the cavity by taking a photon energy cut - off of @xmath91ev which is detuned from the exciton resonance energy . using this approach",
    ", we can easily include the effects of energetic and orientational disorder on the exciton dispersion .",
    "thus , armed with the molecular crystal geometry , the excitation energies , and the electronic transition moments , one can determine the polariton energies varying with photon wave - vector for a given microcavity , by diagonalizing the above hamiltonian for a given photon wave - vector .    in fig .",
    "[ dispersion1]a we show the single - particle eigenvalues of the coupled exciton / photon system for photon @xmath8-vectors between @xmath92 as determined by diagonalizing @xmath93 at specific values of @xmath8 .",

    "the lower thick - line highlights the `` lower polariton '' ( lp ) branch in this system .",
    "looking closely , one can identify multiple upper polariton bands that pass through the density of states .",
    "also it is important to note that not every exciton state couples to the photon field .",
    "these dark states result from the fact that their net transition dipole is either very small or nearly perpendicular to the polarization vector of the driving laser field .    within an organic molecular crystal , orientational disorder of the individual molecules",
    "inhibits the formation of delocalized excitonic states within the lattice .",
    "consequently , this may limit the ability of the system to form collective coherent excitations such as polaritons .",

    "in fig.[dispersion1]b we show the polariton curves for a slab with @xmath96 of orientational disorder .",
    "the primary effect of the orientational disorder appears to be that polaritons formed by coupling to the lowest davydov states splits into multiple polariton states as evidenced by the increased number of anti - crossings that can be spotted within the density of states .",
    "moreover , the first anti - crossing occurs at slightly lower values of @xmath8 . in fig .",
    "[ dispersion1](c , d ) we show the relative mixing between the cavity photon and the anthracene slab for both the ordered slab ( c ) and the orientationally disordered slab ( d ) . in both cases",

    "while a fully `` molecular '' treatment is possible in principle using a site - wise representation , the @xmath98 length - scales suggested by the dispersion curves in fig .  [ dispersion1 ] would require two dimensional slabs with upwards of @xmath99 anthracene sites .",
    "on the other hand , the bare exciton dispersions are essentially flat over the range of wave vectors that are important for polariton formation within the cavity . bearing this in mind ,",

    "it is difficult to obtain a good estimate for this parameter so we set @xmath129 mev which would correspond to a polariton / polariton collision frequency of @xmath130 which seems to a reasonable estimate at low exciton densities .",

    "the orange / yellow ring indicates that scattering occurs to all @xmath8-vectors on the energy shell given by @xmath188 .",
    "a polariton droplet created under these conditions would evolve on the `` on - shell '' ring as observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we next consider what happens when the driving field is close to the bottom of the lp dispersion curve and nearly resonant with the lp polariton . in fig .",
    "[ dispersion3 ] , the driving field is detuned 1mev to the blue from the @xmath189 . here , the idler and signal dispersion touch at @xmath142 creating a single point of degeneracy that becomes unstable as @xmath139 increases .    in fig .",
    "[ becplot]a and b we show the signal resulting from the polaritonic defects .",
    "below threshold , all eigenvalues of @xmath164 have negative imaginary components and we see a tight ring indicating that scattering occurs to all @xmath8-vectors on the @xmath190 constant energy shell ( rayleigh scattering ) . above threshold intensity , this ring collapses to a single peak at @xmath191 indicating the formation of a single component `` condensate '' or polariton superfluid state .",
    "this does not occur at @xmath22 , rather exactly at @xmath142 .",
    "this is consistent with what one would expect for momentum distribution for an interacting bose gas @xcite @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the condensate fraction and @xmath194 is the non - condensate occupation , which is more or less constant with a weak divergence @xmath195 as @xmath196 .",
    "@xcite this state is special since it is the only one that grows as the number of bosons in the system @xmath41 increases .",
    "note that the peak is _ shifted _ since the system is driven by the pumping field that has a wave - vector @xmath113 . since we have assumed the pumping field to be of the form @xmath197 , it equivalent to imposing a moving reference frame on the system .",
    "furthermore , our theory does not include inelastic scattering events that would scattering the signal off the energy - shell .",
    "in this paper , we discuss the conditions under which polartiton bec could be achieved in an organic microcavity with @xmath52-aggregate molecules such as anthracene .",
    "we have identified conditions under which spontaneous coherence and parametric amplification may be achieved in a polariton gas giving rise to a quantum phase transition to a superfluid phase in an organic thin - film system .",
    "this opens the door to experimental probes of polariton condensate dynamics and construction of a quantum phase diagram for organic micro - cavity systems . to date ,",
    "evidence for bec in organic microcavities has not been presented in the literature although efforts to achieve this are underway .",
    "it is important to discuss factors not included in our model which may inhibit or perhaps preclude the formation of stable condensate states in these systems . of primary concern",
    "is the ability to fabricate well - ordered molecular arrays within the microcavity .",
    "it is absolutely critical that the exciton transition moment be parallel to the reflecting walls of the cavity in order to maximize the coupling to the photon field .",
    "it is also likely that local orientational disorder will inhibit the formation of long - ranged coherences within the cavity . as seen in fig .",
    "[ dispersion1 ] orientational disorder gives rise to an increase in anti - crossings and an increase in the number of intermediate polariton bands .",
    "these may serve to deplete the lp population .",
    "likewise , strong coupling between the electronic and intramolecular vibrational modes leads to a detuning of the spontaneous emission band ( fluorescence ) from the vertical absorption absorption band .",
    "however , since the strongest electron photon coupling in these systems is local to a given molecular site , this will decrease as the davydov state contributing to the lp is delocalized over multiple molecular sites .",
    "our current approach does not include internal relaxation due to inelastic scattering events . from detailed balance considerations , inelastic scattering will shift the scattering signal towards lower wave vectors and hence the condensate peak to shift towards @xmath198 .",
    "thermalization must be rapid compared to the polariton lifetime in order to achieve a true bec state at @xmath22 .",
