    "the building blocks of the universe are reasonably well - known from a cosmological point of view  @xcite . in particular , we now know that about 73  % of the energy density is in the form of dark energy and causes the accelerated expansion of the universe while the remaining 27  % is composed of matter .",
    "baryonic matter makes up only 5  % , while about five times as much is in the form of a non - luminous weakly interacting species , dubbed `` dark matter '' ( dm ) .",
    "while this cosmological book - keeping is well developed , the particle nature of dm continues to be one of the most important open questions of particle physics  @xcite .    in this context , much attention has been devoted to crafting well - motivated and viable theories of dm .",
    "the most popular candidates for dm are weakly interacting massive particles  ( wimps ) .",
    "wimps arise naturally in theories , such as supersymmetry , which provide a solution to the hierarchy problem and include a `` natural '' dm candidate  @xcite once a discrete symmetry , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath3-parity , is introduced , so that the least massive particle charged under the new symmetry is stable or very long lived  @xcite .",
    "this kind of dm comes with the wimp miracle , _",
    "i.e. _ , the correct interaction cross - section to thermally produce the density of dm in the early universe  @xcite . in hindsight , this becomes the most appealing feature of such dm .",
    "the same is true for extra - dimensional models where kk parity ensures the stability of the dm candidates  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the closeness of the dark matter and baryonic energy densities is merely a coincidence , since they are produced by unrelated mechanisms .",
    "however , their similarity suggests that they originated from the same source .",
    "this is the case in models of asymmetric dark matter ( adm ) , a relatively old idea @xcite which has been exploited in several models for dm generation @xcite and has recently received a rising interest @xcite . in adm models ,",
    "the dm is made up of charge - neutral dirac fermions , just like baryonic matter and unlike the susy neutralino which is a majorana fermion .",
    "thus , the dm we see today is not generated thermally in the early universe , but through a particle - antiparticle asymmetry in its production mechanism tied to the production of ordinary matter , giving rise to similar number densities for ordinary matter and dm .",
    "therefore , models of adm often predict dm masses of @xmath4  gev , except in instances where the adm number density can be boltzmann suppressed or tuned to result in a larger mass  ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "the phenomenology of adm is therefore quite different from that of a thermal dm relic . in particular , the prospects of indirect detection of dm in these models are suppressed , since the dm does not annihilate if only an asymmetric component is present .",
    "nevertheless , there could still be some indirect effects , such as the effect of accreting adm in the core of stars  @xcite .    as was stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , any process that creates a baryon or lepton asymmetry could be intimately tied to the creation of adm as well . in most adm models ,",
    "this production of a dm asymmetry is seeded by the observed baryon asymmetry and transferred to the dark sector .",
    "however , there has been a recent interest in the opposite mechanism , namely , the creation of a dm asymmetry that is subsequently converted partially into the sm  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we instead assume that the asymmetries in both baryons and dm are created simultaneously by the same processes , as suggested by their similar abundances .",
    "first , a lepton asymmetry from the decay of heavy right - handed neutrinos , as in leptogenesis @xcite , is induced and then this lepton number is partially converted into both baryon and dm numbers through new sphaleron processes . in order to achieve this , we will assume that there is an additional non - abelian gauge symmetry group @xmath5 , under which both the dm sector and the sm fermions are charged .",
    "for definiteness , we will consider an additional @xmath6 symmetry , but other symmetry groups could also fulfill our purposes .",
    "this extra gauge symmetry could arise from some unified theory at higher scales , although this is not required .",
    "apart from the right - handed neutrinos and the extra gauge symmetry ( spontaneously broken by scalar sm singlets ) , we only need to introduce new fermion fields @xmath7 , that are singlets under the sm gauge group but couple to the new gauge symmetry , and will provide the dm candidates .",
    "we include a qcd - like gauge interaction for the dm fermions that prevents their mixing with neutrinos , ensuring their stability without any ad hoc discrete symmetry .",
    "the similarity with the sm qcd interaction is also suggestive , given the similar masses of baryons and dm required to fit the observed energy densities .",
    "as the dm is essentially composed of dark baryons , it scatters with itself through the qcd - like gauge interaction .",
    "this self - interaction can be quite large and leads to almost spherical dm halos in galaxies , in somewhat better agreement with data , compared to wimps  @xcite .",
    "the current best limit on the interaction strength comes from observed ellipticities of dm halos of galaxies  @xcite .",
    "however , limits from colliding galaxy clusters , though slightly weaker , are thought to be more robust .",
    "these observations tell us that the qcd - like gauge interaction can not be much stronger than that between baryons .",
    "as stated in the introduction , a general feature of adm models is that the production mechanisms for the dm are somehow related to the baryon asymmetry in order to obtain similar abundances .",
    "for example , early proposals  @xcite include charging light dm fermions under @xmath8 in order to fix its abundance together with the baryon and lepton asymmetries as a result of the thermal equilibrium in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "if dark and baryonic matter have similar number densities , present cosmology data favour rather light values of the dm fermions mass .",
    "thus , collider constraints rule out the possibility of dm being part of a ( pure ) @xmath8 multiplet .",
    "we instead propose that the dm abundance can be the result of sphaleron processes due to a new gauge symmetry that connects the dm and sm sectors .",
    "in such a setting , we extend the sm gauge group by an additional non - abelian gauge symmetry @xmath5 under which the dm is charged . in order to generate a dm number @xmath7 , related to additional fermions introduced in the theory",
    ", we also need to charge some of the sm fermions under this gauge group , generally leading to the associated sphalerons violating the global charges such that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are constants",
    ". since the extra sphalerons are responsible for the creation of the dm number , we will refer to them as `` dark sphalerons '' and to the process of the conversion of lepton or baryon number into dm number as `` aidnogenesis '' .",
    "together with the sm sphalerons , which satisfy @xmath11 and @xmath12 , this will result in a single conserved quantity @xmath13 , when both sphalerons are active .",
    "this quantity is what needs to be generated in the early universe in order to accommodate both the baryon and dm numbers and is the equivalent to @xmath14 in models of leptogenesis . in the model given below , we will assume that leptogenesis produces an initial @xmath15 number , which is then partially transformed into @xmath16 and @xmath7 by sphaleron processes , we therefore have baryogenesis and aidnogenesis via leptogenesis .    to compute the abundance of @xmath16 and @xmath7",
    ", we must first write down the equilibrium equations for the chemical potentials of different particle species when both sm and dark sphalerons are active . these equations will be dependent on the specific extension of the sm , but generally lead to a relation of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an @xmath4 constant .",
    "once the additional sphalerons become inactive , the sm sphalerons will continue to act in the standard way , leading to the equilibrium relation @xmath19 ( in the case of three fermion generations and one higgs doublet in the standard sector ) , while conserving @xmath7 and @xmath14 .",
    "thus , for the final relation between the baryon and dm numbers , we obtain @xmath20 this results in a prediction for the dm mass through @xmath21 thus , with @xmath18 being @xmath4 , we would expect the dm mass to be close to the proton mass . it should be noted that the dm mass is here the mass of the lightest of the additional fermions which is stable , since dm number is conserved at the lagrangian level .",
    "from the previous section , the question of whether or not aidnogenesis can be achieved in a specific model realization naturally follows . in this section",
    ", we will give an example of such realization in a concrete model and compute the corresponding dm density and properties .",
    "for this specific realization , we extend the sm gauge group with an additional @xmath22 , where the @xmath23 is a horizontal symmetry introduced to provide the dark sphalerons . we have chosen an @xmath23 for the simplicity of the discussion but , in principle , other non - abelian gauge symmetries encompassing all three fermion generations could be considered as well to address the flavor puzzle .",
    "the additional dark color ( dc ) group @xmath24 is a color - like gauge interaction in the dark sector .",
    "the dm candidate in this model is a charge neutral @xmath24 baryon .",
    "the fermionic field content in the model is given in tab .",
    "[ tab : modi ] with the corresponding charges .",
    "notice that the choice of which fermion generations form the @xmath23 doublets is arbitrary and only affects the constraints that can be set with present data on flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes on the scale at which the symmetry is broken , but not the generation of the baryon and dm asymmetry . in tab .",
    "[ tab : modi ] the @xmath23 doublets are composed from the fermions of the first two generations , for which the present bounds are strongest , but other possibilities will be briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : symcomp ] .",
    "notice that the only fermion singlet is the right - handed neutrino , for which a majorana mass is allowed and will be assumed in order to have a see - saw mechanism @xcite for neutrino masses and a lepton number asymmetry in their decay that can seed baryo- and aidnogenesis .",
    "this is also consistent with having an even number of @xmath23 doublets , as required by the cancellation of the witten anomaly  @xcite for the @xmath6 groups .",
    "for the same reason , the left - handed components of the dm fermions should not form @xmath8 doublets . moreover , since the dm fermions are dirac , we can define a global dm number @xmath7 , that will be conserved at the lagrangian level just as the baryon number @xmath16 .",
    "we further assume that the scalar sector is such that it can provide the required mass terms for the fermions , either directly or through higher - dimensional operators , after the breaking of both , the electroweak and the @xmath23 symmetries .",
    "for instance , a minimal realization consists of an extra @xmath23 doublet , besides the sm higgs , with yukawa couplings given in terms of effective @xmath25 operators such as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the @xmath28 higgs . after breaking of the @xmath23 symmetry ,",
    "this reproduces the sm yukawa terms . just like the @xmath25 weinberg operator for neutrino masses ,",
    "such operators can be generated in several different ways .",
    "the relevant phenomenological aspects of the model are independent of the scalar sector , so we shall not discuss it in more detail .",
    ".fermion field content for our illustrative model and the corresponding charge assignments .",
    "whenever a field has an index @xmath29 , the model contains three copies of this field .",
    "note that the assignment of putting particular generations in the @xmath23 doublets is arbitrary .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on the other hand , the strongest constraint on @xmath30 from fcnc stems from the bound on the decay @xmath31 and implies that @xmath32  gev@xmath33 , which would cause tension with the lower bounds derived in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] .",
    "however , this constraint does not apply if the horizontal symmetry is broken in stages .",
    "for example , this may be achieved by first breaking the @xmath23 to @xmath34 by a real scalar triplet acquiring a vacuum expectation value along the @xmath35 direction and giving large masses to the flavor changing gauge bosons while leaving the flavor conserving one massless .",
    "this procedure is similar to georgi and glashow s model of electroweak interactions , which did not include neutral currents  @xcite .",
    "the remaining flavor diagonal @xmath34 can be subsequently broken at a scale low enough to obtain interactions of the strength required for the dark mesons to decay into two muons . in this case",
    "the dominant decay channel of the dark mesons could be to two muons and the constraints on the left - handed panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] would apply . reconciling this scenario with the lower bound on @xmath36 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sphalerons ] ) is easy since the scale of the @xmath23 symmetry breaking is unrelated to the mass of the flavour - conserving @xmath37 , for instance with @xmath38 the sphalerons would reach thermal equilibrium at @xmath39 gev and the first stage of symmetry breaking , which would freeze out the sphalerons , should occur above @xmath40 gev .",
    "an interesting alternative would be to couple the two heaviest sm fermion generations to the @xmath23 and having the scalar triplet acquire its vev along the @xmath41 direction . in this case",
    "the residual @xmath34 would still induce fcnc in the @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 sectors but the constraints are in this case weaker and allow for sufficiently fast dark meson decays .",
    "indeed , such a @xmath34 with strength @xmath45  gev@xmath33 is allowed by present data and would contribute to cp violation in the @xmath46 system , accommodating the observed dimuon anomaly at tevatron  @xcite . in this case",
    "the dark mesons would decay into a tau and a muon and the constraints depicted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] would apply . in this scenario",
    ", it is also possible to identify the scale of the @xmath23 symmetry breaking with the mass of the flavour - changing @xmath37 contributing to @xmath46 mixing . in combination with eq .",
    "( [ eq : sphalerons ] ) this would imply that @xmath47 and @xmath48 tev , for the dark sphalerons to enter in thermal equilibrium at @xmath49 .",
    "the detection prospects for this kind of dm mainly come from three directions : direct detection through nuclear recoil , production at colliders , and through fcncs .",
    "the most interesting prospects are from direct detection by observing the nuclear recoil of a dm particle hitting a nucleon . given that the cross - section goes as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is an energy at the typical scale of the dm mass in our model , we predict a adm - nucleon cross - section @xmath52  @xmath53 , where we have used the dark meson lifetime constraint @xmath54  gev@xmath33 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that generally the sensitivity of direct detection experiments is weaker for the low dm mass regime favored by adm . in this regime ,",
    "the present bounds set on the spin - independent cross section by the xenon100 @xcite and cdms @xcite collaborations are @xmath55  @xmath53 . however , proposed upgrades to these experiments or future experiments could probe most of the allowed range .    from the collider perspective ,",
    "the best present bounds come from the non - observation of the @xmath37 associated to the @xmath34 .",
    "the results from lep - ii suggest that , if the @xmath37 at low energies couples with full strength to electrons and other charged leptons then @xmath56  gev@xmath33  @xcite , while the present limits from tevatron are subdominant . this would be in tension with the interpretation of the dama and cogent experiments that require  @xmath57gev@xmath33  @xcite .",
    "these bounds could be evaded if the @xmath23 gauge symmetry couples mainly to the heavier charged lepton generations . in any case",
    ", the bound is about two or three orders of magnitude above the dark meson lifetime constraint .",
    "there is scope to improve this at lhc , where the limits can be improved by almost 30  % in some regions of the @xmath58 plane . on the other hand ,",
    "future lhc constraints could be derived from a somewhat general approach , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , where one could explore cross - sections well - below @xmath59  @xmath53 and almost all the way to @xmath60  @xmath53 , depending on the details of the coupling of dm to quarks .    furthermore , fcnc processes are generic features of this type of model",
    ". however , the interaction strength for these depends on the specifics of symmetry breaking and can be either strong enough to be already making an impact at present experiments ( _ i.e. _ , the tevatron dimuon anomaly ) or so weak that it is unobservable for all practical purposes ( _ i.e. _ , the symmetry is broken in such a way that only a flavor diagonal interaction remains at lower energies ) . if fcncs are discovered at super - b factories  @xcite , the flavor symmetry breaking structure could be probed .",
    "in this work , we have discussed the prospects of generating asymmetric dark matter ( adm ) from an initial lepton asymmetry through the sphalerons of a new non - abelian gauge group .",
    "the initial lepton asymmetry is taken to be the result of a leptogenesis mechanism . as an example of a model where this occurs",
    ", we have discussed an anomaly free model , in which the standard model ( sm ) is extended by dark matter fermion fields and an additional horizontal @xmath6 gauge symmetry .",
    "in addition , the model contains a color like @xmath1 gauge interaction in the dark sector , preventing the mixing with the right - handed neutrinos and requiring the dark matter to be in the form of charge neutral baryon - like states .",
    "the mass of these baryon - like states is predicted by comparing the number densities of baryons and dark baryons with the ratio @xmath61 and the result is @xmath62  gev .",
    "the similarity with the sm qcd interaction is also suggestive , given the similar masses of baryons and dm required to fit the observed energy densities .",
    "the @xmath1 self - interaction can be quite large and leads to almost spherical dm halos in galaxies , in somewhat better agreement with data , compared to wimps .    in order",
    "to get rid of the thermally produced symmetric component of the dark matter before big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , it is required that the dark mesons decay into sm fields with a coupling constant of @xmath63  gev@xmath33 .",
    "thus , the predictions of this model are suggestively close to the values favoured by a consistent description of the dama and cogent experiments , which require @xmath64  gev and a dm - baryon interaction with strength  @xmath65 .    in the particular realization we discussed ,",
    "the additional chiral symmetry corresponding to the dark sphalerons is a horizontal symmetry inspired by possible solutions to the flavor puzzle and the tevatron dimuon anomaly .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this work to build a full model addressing these two problems in combination with dark matter generation .",
    "however , the possibility of a connection between dark matter and the flavor puzzle is intriguing and should be explored further .",
