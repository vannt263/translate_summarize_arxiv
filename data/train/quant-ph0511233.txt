    "quantum state engineering is a necessary preliminary step in many applications of quantum information processing ( qip ) .",
    "the realization of nonclassical states of discrete as well as continuous variables ( cv ) is often required as an off - line resource in protocols for quantum computation and communication . as an example",
    ", the preparation of schrdinger cat states of a cv system is one of the key ingredients in the performance of coherent state quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "very recently , efficient proposals for the realization of schrdinger cat states have been put forward  @xcite . on the other hand , an entangled coherent state of two field modes  @xcite serves as a quantum channel in the realization of teleportation - based coherent state - quantum computation  @xcite . in these last years",
    ", the use of hybrid quantum registers made up of systems having different nature ( _ i.e. _ spanning hilbert spaces of different dimensions ) has been recognized to be a useful way to improve the flexibility of a physical device .",
    "both the manipulability and the robustness against decoherence in computation and communication are often improved by a hybrid setup .",
    "therefore , the necessity of performing quantum state engineering involving systems of different nature is raising increasing interest in the qip community .",
    "a usual requirement in the context of quantum state engineering of coherent states is the availability of efficient sources of nonlinear interactions .",
    "unfortunately , the current state of the art is such that only small nonlinear rates can be attained .",
    "this represents a big hindrance not only for the creation of nonclassical states but also for single - photon quantum computation .",
    "ways to nearly - deterministically bypass this bottleneck have been envisaged with the simulation of nonlinear interaction by photodetection  @xcite .",
    "more recently , munro and coworkers  @xcite showed an efficient way to perform all - optical quantum computation using single photons by adopting the quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement technique using a low cross - kerr nonlinearity and strong amplitude coherent field .    even though this represents a major step forward in the field of manipulating the state of travelling - light waves , the proposal in  @xcite",
    "is not the only situation where the use of nonlinearity - based qnd can be successfully exploited . in cavity - quantum electrodynamics ( cavity - qed ) ,",
    "a very similar technique involving a bosonic system in a coherent state and a fermionic system in a two - dimensional state has already been experimentally demonstrated .",
    "in particular , bertet _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured the wigner distribution of a fock state based on the theoretical proposals  @xcite , which exploit cross - kerr - based qnd techniques and , very recently , maioli _ et al . _",
    "performed rydberg atom counting based on qnd measurement  @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that , differently from a running field , the nonlinearity rate achievable in cavity - qed is large enough not to require exceedingly long interaction times or intense light fields .    in this paper , we investigate further on the use of cross - kerr qnd interactions by suggesting theoretical protocols for the implementation of effective quantum state engineering in a cavity - qed setup . in all the schemes suggested here ,",
    "the synergy between two - level and infinite dimensional systems is the key element .",
    "we address explicitly the transfer of entanglement between subsystems of different nature , thoroughly analyzing the conditions for the maximal transfer of entanglement .",
    "this results in the proposal for entanglement transfer from discrete to cv systems and the adaptation of the recently proposed protocol for _ entanglement reciprocation _",
    "@xcite , which achieves a complete ebit of a two - qubit state starting from a cv entangled state .",
    "the inherently hybrid nature of the cross - kerr interactions treated here allows us to design a simple scheme for entanglement swapping  @xcite between discrete and cv entangled states .",
    "the possibility of using the resulting state for building up effective quantum repeaters  @xcite for long - range communication is briefly sketched .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ interazione ]",
    "we briefly describe the formal approach to the interaction between an atom and a coherent state of a cavity field - mode at the basis of the effective cross - kerr interaction .",
    "section  [ state ] is devoted to information transfer , which serves as a basic building block to be used for the other tasks analized in our work .",
    "these are mainly entanglement transfer , approached in section  [ transfer ] and entanglement reciprocation , which is the center of section  [ reciprocation ] .",
    "section  [ multiple ] shows that the trasnfer and reciprocation scheme can be generalized in such a way that an initial entanglement corresponding to @xmath0 ebits can be mutually exchanged between matter and light . finally , in section  [ swapping ] we fully exploit the hybrid nature of the qnd model used here to suggest a suitably modified version of an entanglement swapping protocol .",
    "section  [ conlcusioni ] remarks on the ingredients required in the physical implementation of our protocols and outlines our main results .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe how the cross - kerr effect is achieved in a cavity - qed system .",
    "we consider a two - level atom with excited and ground states @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , interacting with a single - mode cavity field with bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operators @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the atomic transition frequency is @xmath5 and the frequency of the cavity field mode is @xmath6 while the interaction rate between the two subsystems is indicated by @xmath7 . in the interaction picture and under the rotating - wave and electric dipole approximations ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is    @xmath8    where @xmath9 denotes the detuning between the two - level atom and the cavity field . in the ordered atomic basis @xmath10 , @xmath11 , the time - evolution operator @xmath12 is given by the following explicit expression  @xcite @xmath13    here",
    ", we have introduced the effective rabi frequency @xmath14 with the photon - number operator @xmath15 .",
    "inspired by the idea of qnd interactions  @xcite , brune _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed an experimental realization in cavity - qed using the model whose evolution is described by eq .",
    "( [ evol - op ] ) . for this purpose ,",
    "a dispersive interaction characterized by a large detuning @xmath16 has been considered rather than a resonant one .",
    "these are exactly the sort of working conditions we want to adopt in this paper . under the condition @xmath17 , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively the average photon number of the cavity field and the corresponding variance , the rabi frequency is dominated by the detuning and only the diagonal terms in eq .",
    "( [ evol - op ] ) are non - negligible , reading @xmath21 in order to better gather the explicit form of the effective time - evolution operator , we consider the approximation @xmath22 and move to a frame rotating at a frequency equal to the detuning @xmath16 . in these conditions , the evolution operator eq .",
    "( [ evol - op ] ) of the atom - field system becomes @xmath23 which clearly shows that no energy exchange between the atom and the field occurs .",
    "just the phase of the atomic state changes depending on the intensity of the cavity field mode .",
    "this is the key for the qnd interaction not to destroy the photon number during its measurement .",
    "this is in perfect analogy with the evolution operator for the cross - kerr coupling @xmath24 between two modes @xmath25 and @xmath26 with the coupling strength @xmath27 .",
    "a big technical difference between these two models is that , while @xmath28 is extremely small in current optical - fibers ( frequently used in order to achieve photon - photon coupling , in running - wave configurations ) , @xmath29 can be large large enough to guarantee an effectively large phase - shift within the decoherence time of the system at hand  @xcite .",
    "this is an important reason which makes the cavity - qed realization of qnd attractive .",
    "recently , based on this dispersive interaction between a field and an atom , wang and duan  @xcite proposed to engineer schordinger cat states and toscano _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested a heisenberg - limited measurement of displacements and rotations .    throughout the paper , we assume that the cavity is initially prepared with a coherent state @xmath30 of amplitude @xmath31 which is routinely done , experimentally , by coupling an external coherent field with the cavity . as a coherent state",
    "is a superposition of number states with the poissonian weight , @xmath32 , applying the evolution operator in eq .",
    "( [ evol - op-2 ] ) to the joint state of discrete and cv systems for the interaction time @xmath33 , we find that @xmath34 which shows the conditional phase - shift achieved by the initial coherent state .",
    "these transformations will be frequently used throughout this paper as the central ingredients of our protocols .",
    "by rescaling the atomic energy in such a way that @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being the energy of the ground state of each atom , it is straightforward to see that the hamiltonian of the system can be written so that the corresponding time - evolution operator reads @xmath37 .",
    "this form of the coupling hamiltonian , which has been discussed in many contexts of quantum optics and quantum information processing  @xcite , is here reinterpreted as the generalization of the ising interaction between two qubits .",
    "this latter has the structure @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the labels for the two qubits , @xmath41 is the interaction rate and @xmath42 is the @xmath43-pauli operator for qubit @xmath44 .",
    "evidently , neither @xmath45 nor @xmath46 describe an effective exchange of excitations between the subsystems they involve .",
    "just a conditional phase - shift is applied , as a result of these two time - propagators , on the joint state of the two subsystems . as the ising interaction is the basis of the theoretical approach to quantum information processing with cluster states  @xcite",
    ", this formal reinterpretation paves the way toward an interesting analysis of the quantum state transfer , quantum entanglement transfer and entanglement reciprocation in terms analogous to the mechanisms which rule the propagation and manipulation of information in a cluster state - based scenario .",
    "the following discussion , which is taken from the general cluster state formalism  @xcite , serves as a building block for the description of the information entanglement transfer protocols with eq .",
    "( [ evol - op-2 ] ) .    in order to transfer a ( normalized ) single - qubit quantum state , @xmath47 of qubit @xmath39",
    "to qubit @xmath40 ( logical states @xmath48 and @xmath49 , for simplicity ) , we first prepare @xmath40 in the balanced superposition @xmath50 . then , we apply @xmath45 , which is equivalent to a control - phase operation that , for @xmath51 , gives a phase - flip only when both the qubits are in @xmath52 .",
    "the joint system is thus in the quantum state @xmath53    by performing a projective measurement on @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 ) , the output state of @xmath40 becomes @xmath56 , corresponding to the measurement outcome @xmath57 respectively .",
    "depending on the outcome of the measurement , a conditional unitary operation on @xmath40 is applied , in order to retrieve perfectly the information initially encoded in the state of qubit @xmath39 . for the outcome @xmath58",
    ", @xmath59 has to be applied to qubit @xmath40 while , for the outcome @xmath60 , the application of @xmath61 is required ( where @xmath62 is the @xmath63-pauli operator ) .",
    "after these conditional correction operations , the state of @xmath40 becomes @xmath64 .",
    "notice that the initial qubit is now encoded in the eigenstates @xmath65 of @xmath66 rather than in the energy eigenstates .",
    "the conversion into this basis can be accomplished with the application of a _ byproduct operator _  @xcite corresponding to a hadamard transformation , which rotates the state into the original basis @xmath67 .    in complete analogy to the above discussion ,",
    "a complete state transfer to a coherent state of the cavity field can be accomplished , through @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ evol - op-2 ] ) , by applying a modified version of the above protocol .",
    "the initial information - encoded qubit @xmath68 is now allowed to interact with a coherent state of the cavity field @xmath69 through eq .",
    "( [ evol - op-2 ] ) for an interaction time @xmath70 , leading to the joint state    @xmath71    a projection of the qubit state onto the @xmath72-pauli matrix @xmath73 eigenstates @xmath74 leads to the state @xmath75 ( for an outcome @xmath76 ) or @xmath77 ( for an outcome @xmath78 ) , where @xmath79 . by remarking that",
    ", already for @xmath80 , @xmath81 , the resulting states represent information - encoded quasi - qubit states . differently from the case where the information - receiver was a qubit , in this instance the wrong relative phase appearing in correspondence to the @xmath76 outcome can be corrected by applying a @xmath82-rotation in the hilbert space of the qubit spanned by @xmath83 .",
    "this rotation can be formally performed by exploiting the technique developed in  @xcite . in our cavity - qed setup ,",
    "we need the injection of an external , amplitude - controlled coherent state into the cavity , which can be done as explained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "however , as our tasks are not related to quantum computation but to communication and information transfer , it is enough to assume here a conservative approach based on just the postselection of the events leading to the @xmath78 outcomes .",
    "the basic principles described in the previous section can be adapted and exploited in order to transfer quantum correlations initially in a two - qubit state to the separable state of two cavity field - modes .",
    "the task is relevant and interesting as the creation of an entangled channel of a cv state is one of the focus points in quantum state engineering with cv .",
    "recently , a considerable interest has been directed toward the achievement of particular regimes of interaction between matter and light to be used for the purposes of generating entangled coherent states  @xcite . on the other hand , here",
    "the approach is different as our task would be the _ transfer _ of correlations already present in an ancillary state onto the joint state of a bipartite mode - field .",
    "such a scenario is made possible by the ease with which entangled pairs of atoms can be created in microwave cavity - qed , as reported in  @xcite , where the entangling technique has been also extended to the generation of three - particle entanglement .",
    "we consider two atoms , labelled as @xmath39 and @xmath40 , in the maximally entangled state ( generated as an off - line resource ) latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 are real functions depending on the overlaps @xmath161 and @xmath162 ( for definiteness we assume here @xmath163 ) .",
    "we are interested in the fidelity @xmath164 which estimates how close the two - qubit state is , after the measurement to @xmath165 .",
    "analytically , we find @xmath166 with @xmath167 @xmath168    the behavior of the fidelity against the width @xmath155 , for two choices of the amplitudes @xmath169 of the coherent states , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fede ] .",
    "a considerable robustness of the scheme against imperfections in the cv - state detection events is made evident for a proper choice of the amplitude of the components of the cv part .",
    "plots showing analogous trends can be obtained regarding the entanglement in the atomic state and its purity : for @xmath170 a highly pure state carrying nearly one ebit of entanglement can be obtained for values of @xmath155 up to @xmath171 .",
    "the corresponding state is extremely close to @xmath172 , as shown by a fidelity - based analysis .",
    "the entanglement transfer and reciprocation schemes discussed in this paper can be easily extended to a multiple set of entangled atomic pairs .",
    "the trick is simply to make successive pairs of entangled atoms interact with their respective cavity fields for distinct amounts of time .",
    "we start by representing the joint entangled state of @xmath0 atoms as @xmath173 , and @xmath174 and @xmath175 are binary numbers .",
    "if we start with the cavity fields in @xmath176 and @xmath177 , and make each pair of atoms interact with the cavity fields for half the time as the previous one in succession , we can obtain the state @xmath178 .",
    "next all the atoms are measured in the @xmath179 basis .",
    "say the outcome is @xmath180 .",
    "then the cavities are projected to the state @xmath181 , then the above is a @xmath182 dimensional maximally entangled state . in other words",
    "all the entanglement of the initial @xmath0-ebits stored in the atomic states have been transferred to the fields .",
    "all the other outcomes also give the same type of entangled state apart from different relative signs between the superposed components in @xmath183 .",
    "for reciprocation of the entanglement back to the atoms , a set of @xmath0 atoms in each cavity are first prepared in the state @xmath184 .",
    "the previous pattern of interactions is now repeated , but with opposite sign of the interaction ( this can be achieved by a @xmath185 followed by the original interaction ) . only for the term @xmath186 in the expansion of ( @xmath187 , both cavity fields are going to return to their original state @xmath188 .",
    "thus by measuring the cavity fields , and obtaining the outcome @xmath188 ( again assuming @xmath189 , so that this measurement is nearly one to an orthogonal basis ) , one projects the atoms to the @xmath0 pairs of ebits entangled state @xmath190 .",
    "thus the full amount of entanglement can be reciprocated conditional on an appropriate outcome .",
    "let us suppose that a two - mode entangled coherent state of the form @xmath191 has been created ( for instance through the scheme described in section  [ transfer ] ) between modes @xmath25 and @xmath26 . on the other hand , we assume we have at our disposal a maximally entangled qubit state , of the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tqmes ] ) , of qubits @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    ". the joint state will read @xmath192 we arrange a @xmath193 interaction between qubit @xmath40 and mode @xmath26 which will change the state above into @xmath194    a homodyne detection discriminating between the different possible phases of mode @xmath26 will project eq .",
    "( [ swap2 ] ) onto either @xmath195 or @xmath196 .",
    "then , a measurement of qubit @xmath40 on the eigenbasis of @xmath197 projects these states onto superpositions which can be always reconducted ( through local atomic unitaries ) to the prototypical form @xmath198 the state in eq .",
    "( [ swap3 ] ) falls into the category of states which can be represented by the general relation @xmath199 with @xmath200 $ ] .",
    "the entanglement in this class of states has been studied in detail in ref .",
    "it is possible to show that , for @xmath201 and @xmath80 , the von neumann entropy corresponding to the state ( [ swap3 ] ) is exactly one ebit .",
    "this implies that , under these conditions , eq .",
    "( [ swap3 ] ) represents a maximally entangled state , therefore implying that the entanglement swapping procedure implemented by the scheme presented here is complete .",
    "the homodyning of the cavity field - mode @xmath26 can be performed by injecting an external coherent state of amplitude @xmath202 into the cavity .",
    "this will add to the pre - existent coherent state in such a way that either the state @xmath203 or @xmath204 is obtained .",
    "then a resonant interaction lasting for a rescaled interaction time @xmath205 with an ancillary atom prepared in its ground state @xmath206 is required .",
    "if the field - mode was in its vacuum state , the probability of finding the atom in @xmath206 will be strictly @xmath39 .",
    "on the other hand , for a large enough @xmath207 , such a probability is smaller ( being still non - zero because of the overlap between @xmath208 and a coherent state ) , allowing for the discrimination of the phase of the cavity field .    the realization of the hybrid quantum channel in eq .",
    "( [ swap3 ] ) can find application in the realization of quantum repeaters  @xcite between cavity modes .",

    "the task is the realization of an entangled channel of modes @xmath25 and @xmath209 which allows for long - haul quantum communication . the state transfer procedure described in section  [ state ]",
    "can be used in order to achieve such a result and create a two - mode coherent entangled state of @xmath25 and @xmath209 .",
    "the realization of this scheme requires the passage of a single atom through multiple cavities , which is foreseeable with present state of the art microwave cavity - qed technology  @xcite .",
    "we have addressed the problem of quantum state engineering with cross - kerr nonlinearities implemented in a cavity - qed based setup .",
    "this has allowed us to address not only the case of systems spanning hilbert spaces of the same dimension but also the interesting situation of a hybrid system of discrete and cv variables . in this context , we have addressed different problems , such as entanglement transfer and reciprocation in order to build up discrete and cv channels for quantum communication and computation .",
