    "the hereinafter oscillator , analyzed in a cylindrical reference frame , is moving along three directions : the second order motion ( main ) ordinary differential equations is linear with variable coefficients . such a dissipative oscillator undertakes : own weight , constraint reaction , coriolis force , centrifugal force , elastic forces , viscous resistance and the inertia force due to the angular acceleration .",
    "all the analytical evaluations have been performed without any approximation .",

    "therefore the bead p modeling the @xmath0-block , has a 3-d motion : its position is set out by a cylindrical coordinate frame with @xmath10 parametric functions of time .",
    "the first two co - ordinates , unknown functions of time , are the object of our inquiry ; the last one is decided by @xmath1 .",
    "such a model , with an obvious change , will also describe the effects induced by an increasing angular speed @xmath11 from a rest up to an absolute maximum .",
    "we choose a reference frame co - mobile with the system , and then include in it the forces of the relative motion .",
    "we put a reference frame @xmath12 co - mobile with the rod , so that the @xmath13motion of the block , which can move on both sides with respect to @xmath7 , is referred to such a non - inertial frame . in such a case ,",
    "the coriolis theorem here arises in its complete six terms formulation : @xmath14 the problems whose closed form solution comes out taking _ all the terms _ of coriolis theorem are presumably very few : we can not cite any one of them .",
    "the chfs are usually occurring in mathematical physics after splitting a partial differential equations in more ordinary differential equations .",
    "their use for linear or nonlinear mechanics problems is not much practiced .",
    "we can refer for instance to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . on the contrary , much greater is their appearance in quantum mechanics : in @xcite we meet chfs in treatments on the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator and in the isotropic one .",

    "an extensive more recent introduction to chfs can be found in @xcite which holds a bibliography of 89 entries . in @xcite ,",
    "several properties of extended chfs are studied showing how they are met in statistical distribution theory .      with reference to  [ f01 ] ,",
