    "he showed that these two senses of coherence are equivalent in the following sense .",
    "each version of coherence results in using the expectation of a random variable as its forecast .",
    "moreover , these expectations are based on a finitely additive probability without requiring that personal probability is countably additive . [ in appendix [ app : lf ] , we explain what we mean by expectations with respect to finitely additive probabilities .",
