    "in recent years there has been a growth of interest in carbon - based materials , in particular in those formed by c atoms with @xmath0 hybridization , as is the case of carbon nanotubes , fullerenes , and graphene , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystal with exceptional electronic properties.@xcite in the zero - temperature limit and in the absence of defects , the c - c bond on the graphene layer is well understood in terms of in - plane localized sp@xmath1 bonds and delocalized out - of - plane @xmath2-like bonds.@xcite the optimum structural arrangement is reached with a honeycomb lattice , resulting in a material with the largest in - plane elastic constants known to date .",
    "departures from this flat structure may appreciably affect the atomic scale properties of the graphene layer and can modify the properties of this material . although the main interest on graphene is due to its extraordinary electronic properties,@xcite the observation of ripples in freely hanged samples gave rise to theoretical interest also in the structural properties of this material.@xcite in fact , ripples or bending fluctuations",
    "have been proposed as one of the main scattering mechanisms limiting the electronic mobility in graphene.@xcite    there appear various reasons for a graphene sheet to depart from strict planarity , among them the presence of defects and external stresses.@xcite defects ( e.g. , vacancies or impurities ) originate deformations in the graphene sheet at the atomic scale , that can propagate giving rise to long - range correlations , and external stresses due to the boundary conditions cause bending and corrugation of the sheet.@xcite even in the absence of defects and stresses , a perfect 2d crystalline layer in three - dimensional ( 3d ) space can not be stable at finite temperatures in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite moreover , thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures produce out - of - plane motion of the carbon atoms , and even in the zero - temperature limit , quantum fluctuations associated to zero - point motion in the out - of - plane direction will cause a departure of strict planarity of the graphene sheet .    from a basic point of view , understanding structural and thermal properties of 2d systems is a challenging problem in modern statistical physics.@xcite it has been traditionally considered mainly in the context of biological membranes and soft condensed matter .",
    "the great complexity of these systems has hindered a microscopic approach based on realistic descriptions of the interatomic interactions .",
    "graphene provides us with a model system where an atomistic description is feasible , thus opening the way to a better comprehension of the physical properties of this kind of systems .",
    "thus , there has been recently a rise of interest on thermodynamic properties of graphene , both theoretically and experimentally.@xcite    finite - temperature properties of graphene have been studied by molecular dynamics and monte carlo simulations using _ ab - initio_,@xcite tight binding,@xcite and empirical interatomic potentials.@xcite in most applications of these methods , atomic nuclei were described as classical particles . to take into account the quantum character of the nuclei , path - integral ( both , molecular dynamics and monte carlo ) simulations turn out to be particularly suitable . in these methods",
    "all nuclear degrees of freedom can be quantized in an efficient way , permitting us to include quantum and thermal fluctuations in many - body systems at finite temperatures .",
    "this allows to carry out quantitative studies of anharmonic effects in condensed matter.@xcite recently , brito _",
    "et al._@xcite have carried out path - integral monte carlo simulations of a single graphene layer .",
    "these authors examined several equilibrium properties of graphene at finite temperatures using a supercell including 200 carbon atoms .",
    "this computational technique has been also applied to study structural properties of a boron nitride monolayer.@xcite moreover , nuclear quantum effects in graphene have been studied earlier by using a combination of density - functional theory and a quasi - harmonic approximation for the vibrational modes.@xcite    in this paper , the path - integral molecular dynamics ( pimd ) method is used to investigate the influence of nuclear quantum dynamics on structural and thermodynamic properties of graphene at temperatures up to 2000  k. we consider simulation cells of different sizes , since finite - size effects are expected to be very important for some equilibrium variables , in particular the projected area of the graphene layer on the plane defined by the simulation box , and the atomic delocalization ( classical and quantum ) in the out - of - plane direction.@xcite low - temperature values of these quantities are analyzed in terms of the third law of thermodynamics , which has to be fulfilled by the results of the quantum simulations as @xmath3 .",
    "we also analyze the anharmonicity of the vibrational modes by comparing results for the kinetic and potential energy derived from the pimd simulations .",
    "path - integral methods analogous to that employed in this work have been applied earlier to study nuclear quantum effects in pure and hydrogen - doped carbon - based materials , as diamond@xcite and graphite.@xcite helium adsorption@xcite and diffusion of h on graphene@xcite have been also studied earlier by using this kind of techniques .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we describe the computational method employed in the calculations .",
    "our results are presented in sec.iii , dealing with the interatomic distance , layer area , vibrational energy , and atomic delocalization .",
    "in sec.iv we discuss the thermodynamic consistency of our data at low temperature , and in sec.v we summarize the main results .",
    "we employ the pimd method to obtain equilibrium properties of graphene at various temperatures .",
    "this method is based on the path - integral formulation of statistical mechanics , which is a powerful nonperturbative approach to study many - body quantum systems at finite temperatures .",
    "it exploits the fact that the partition function of a quantum system can be written in a way formally equivalent to that of a classical one , obtained by substituting each quantum particle by a ring polymer consisting of @xmath4 ( trotter number ) classical particles , connected by harmonic springs.@xcite thus , the actual implementation of this procedure is based on an isomorphism between the real quantum system and a fictitious classical system of ring polymers , in which each quantum particle is described by a polymer ( corresponding to a cyclic quantum path ) composed of @xmath4 `` beads''.@xcite this becomes exact in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "details on this simulation technique can be found elsewhere.@xcite    here we use the molecular dynamics method to sample the configuration space of the classical isomorph of our quantum system ( @xmath6 carbon atoms ) .",
    "this is the so - called pimd method .",
    "we note that the dynamics in this computational technique is artificial , in the sense that it does not correspond to the actual quantum dynamics of the real particles under consideration .",
    "it is , however , useful for effectively sampling the many - body configuration space , giving precise results for time - independent equilibrium properties of the quantum system .",
    "an important question in the pimd method is an adequate description of the interatomic interactions , which should be as realistic as possible .",
    "since employing an _ ab - initio _ method would enormously restrict the size of our simulation cell , we derive the born - oppenheimer surface for the nuclear dynamics from an effective empirical potential , developed for carbon - based systems , namely the so - called lcbopii.@xcite this is a long - range carbon bond order potential , which has been employed earlier to carry out classical simulations of diamond,@xcite graphite,@xcite , liquid carbon,@xcite as well as graphene layers.@xcite in particular , it was used to predict the carbon phase diagram comprising graphite , diamond , and the liquid , showing its accuracy by comparison of the predicted graphite - diamond line with experimental data.@xcite in the case of graphene , this effective potential has been found to give a good description of elastic properties such as the young s modulus.@xcite also , the interatomic potential employed here yields at 300 k a bending modulus @xmath7 = 1.6 ev for graphene at 300 k.@xcite this value is close to the best fit to experimental and theoretical results obtained for @xmath7 by lambin.@xcite to our knowledge , this is the first time that the lcbopii potential is used to perform path - integral simulations of this kind of systems",
    ".    calculations were carried out in the isothermal - isobaric ensemble , where we fix the number of carbon atoms ( @xmath6 ) , the applied stress ( @xmath8 ) , and the temperature ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we used effective algorithms for performing pimd simulations in this statistical ensemble , as those described in the literature.@xcite in particular , we employed staging variables to define the bead coordinates , and the constant - temperature ensemble was generated by coupling chains of four nos - hoover thermostats with mass @xmath10 to each staging variable ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "an additional chain of four barostats was coupled to the area of the simulation box to yield the required constant pressure ( here @xmath8).@xcite    the equations of motion were integrated by employing the reversible reference system propagator algorithm ( respa ) , which allows us to define different time steps for the integration of the fast and slow degrees of freedom.@xcite the time step @xmath12 associated to the interatomic forces was taken in the range between 0.5 and 1 fs , which was found to be adequate for the interatomic interactions , atomic masses , and temperatures considered here , and provided appropriate convergence for the studied magnitudes . for the evolution of the fast dynamical variables , including the thermostats and harmonic bead interactions , we used a time step @xmath13 , as in earlier pimd simulations.@xcite the kinetic energy @xmath14 has been calculated by using the so - called virial estimator , which is known to have a statistical uncertainty smaller than the potential energy of the system.@xcite    sampling of the configuration space has been carried out at temperatures between 12  k and 2000  k. for comparison with results of pimd simulations , some classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of graphene have been also carried out .",
    "this is realized in our context by setting the trotter number @xmath4 = 1 . for the quantum simulations ,",
    "the trotter number @xmath4 was taken proportional to the inverse temperature ( @xmath15 ) , so that @xmath16 = 6000  k , which turns out to roughly keep a constant precision in the pimd results at different temperatures.@xcite    we have considered rectangular simulation cells with similar side length in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions of the @xmath19 reference plane , and periodic boundary conditions were assumed . we checked that using isotropic changes of the cell dimensions in the @xmath20 simulations yielded for the studied variables the same results as allowing flexible cells ( independent changes of @xmath17 and @xmath18 axis length along with deformations of the rectangular shape ) . moreover , to check the possible influence of the boundary conditions , we also used supercells of the primitive hexagonal cell , and found no change in our results .",
    "cells of size up to 33600 atoms were considered for simulations at @xmath21 300  k , but at lower temperatures , smaller sizes were dealt with due to the fast increase in @xmath4 .",
    "( note that for @xmath6 = 33600 carbon atoms at 100 k , we have to handle a total of @xmath22 classical - like beads . ) for a given temperature , a typical simulation run consisted of @xmath23 pimd steps for system equilibration , followed by @xmath24 steps for the calculation of ensemble average properties .",
    "we have checked that this simulation length is much larger than the the autocorrelation time @xmath25 of the variables studied here ( for our zero - stress conditions ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath25 for the in - plane area @xmath26 appreciably increases as the system size rises , and for the largest sizes discussed here we have found autocorrelation times in the order of @xmath27 simulation steps .",
    "pimd simulations can be used to study the atomic delocalization at finite temperatures .",
    "this includes a thermal ( classical ) delocalization , as well as a delocalization associated to the quantum character of the atomic nuclei , which can be quantified by the extension of the paths associated to a given atomic nucleus . for each quantum path",
    ", one can define the center - of - gravity ( centroid ) as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the position of bead @xmath30 in the associated ring polymer .",
    "then , the mean - square displacement @xmath31 of the atomic nuclei along a pimd simulation run is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 indicates an ensemble average .",
    "the kinetic energy of a particle is related to its quantum delocalization , or in our context , to the spread of the paths associated to it , which can be measured by the mean - square `` radius - of - gyration '' @xmath34 of the ring polymers : @xmath35 a smaller @xmath34 ( higher particle localization ) corresponds to a larger kinetic energy , in line with heisenberg s uncertainty principle.@xcite    the total spatial delocalization of a quantum particle at a finite temperature includes , in addition to @xmath34 , another term which takes into account motion of the centroid @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 with @xmath38 this term @xmath39 can be considered as a semiclassical thermal contribution to @xmath31 , since at high @xmath9 it converges to the mean - square displacement given by a classical model , and each quantum path collapses onto a single point ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "for our case of graphene , we call @xmath19 the coordinates on the plane defined by the simulation cell , and @xmath41 the out - of - plane perpendicular direction",
    ". then , we will have expressions similar to those given above for each direction @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath41 .",
    "for example , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "in this section we present results for interatomic distances in graphene .",
    "the temperature dependence of the equilibrium c  c distance , @xmath44 , as derived from our pimd simulations at zero applied stress is displayed in fig .  1 ( squares ) .",
    "in the low - temperature limit , we find an interatomic distance of 1.4287(1 )  , which increases for increasing temperature , as could be expected from the thermal expansion of the graphene sheet .",
    "we note that the size effect of the finite simulation cell is negligible for our purposes .",
    "in fact , for a given temperature , we found no difference between the results for @xmath44 obtained for the considered cell sizes , i.e. , differences between data for @xmath45 were similar to the error bars obtained for each cell size ( much less than the symbol size in fig .  1 ) .    for comparison with the results of the quantum simulations , we also present in fig .",
    "1 the temperature dependence of @xmath44 in the classical limit with the same lcbopii potential , as derived from md simulations ( circles ) .",
    "these results show at low @xmath9 a nearly linear increase , similar to that found for lattice parameters of crystalline solids in a classical approximation , which is known to violate the third law of thermodynamics@xcite ( i.e. , the thermal expansion coefficient should vanish for @xmath3 ) .",
    "this anomaly of the classical model is remedied in the quantum simulations , which yield a vanishing slope for the @xmath44 vs @xmath9 plot in the low - temperature limit .",
    "the results of the classical simulations converge at low @xmath9 to an interatomic distance of 1.4199  , corresponding to the minimum energy for a flat graphene sheet .",
    "this value is close to the distance @xmath44 derived from _ ab - initio _ simulations in the limit @xmath3.@xcite    the quantum simulations predict an interatomic distance larger than the classical calculation , due basically to the fact that zero - point motion of the carbon atoms in the quantum model detects the anharmonicity of the interatomic potential even for @xmath3 . in this limit",
    ", we find a zero - point expansion of the c  c distance of @xmath46  , i.e. , the bond distance increases by a 0.6% respect the classical prediction .",
    "this is close to a zero - point expansion of 0.53% derived by brito _",
    "et al._@xcite from path - integral monte carlo simulations .",
    "this increase in mean bond length is much larger than the precision currently achieved in the determination of cell parameters from diffraction techniques.@xcite the bond expansion due to nuclear quantum effects decreases as temperature rises , as should happen , since in the high-@xmath9 limit the classical and quantum predictions have to converge one to the other .",
    "we observe , however , that at a temperature of 2000  k the c  c distance obtained from the quantum simulations is still larger than the classical prediction ( the difference is much larger than the error bars ) .    in the quantum results ,",
    "the increase in interatomic distance from @xmath9 = 0  k to room temperature ( @xmath9 = 300  k ) is small , and amounts to @xmath47  , more than 15 times smaller than the zero - point expansion . note that the bond expansion associated to zero - point motion is in the order of the thermal expansion predicted by the classical model from @xmath9  =  0 to 800  k. these results ( classical and quantum ) for a single layer of graphene are qualitatively similar to those found earlier from simulations of carbon - based materials . for diamond , in particular ,",
    "it was found a zero - point expansion of the lattice parameter @xmath48  , a 0.5% of the classical prediction.@xcite    the thermal bond expansion as well as the zero - point bond dilation discussed here are a signature of the anharmonicity of the interatomic potential , similar to 3d crystalline solids ( see above ) . in the case of graphene",
    "this effect is basically due to anharmonicity in the stretching vibrations of the sp@xmath1 c - c bond .",
    "a more involved anharmonicity appears in the description of the thermal variation of the graphene area , due to the coupling between in - plane and out - of - plane modes , as shown in the following section .",
    "the simulations ( both classical md and pimd ) presented here were carried out in the isothermal - isobaric ensemble , as explained in sec .",
    "this means that in a simulation run we fix the number of atoms @xmath6 , the temperature @xmath9 , and the applied stress in the @xmath19 plane ( @xmath8 in our simulations ) , thus allowing changes in the area of the simulation cell on which periodic boundary conditions are applied . since carbon atoms are free to move in the out - of - plane direction ( coordinate @xmath41 )",
    ", it is obvious that in general any measure of the `` real '' surface of the graphene sheet will give a value larger than the area of the simulation cell in the @xmath19 plane . taking into account that the actual simulations yield",
    "directly the mean in - plane area @xmath26 for given @xmath6 , @xmath9 , and @xmath49 , and that this quantity has been discussed earlier in the literature , we present it for our classical and quantum simulations .       in fig .  2 we display the temperature dependence of the in - plane area @xmath26 associated to the graphene layer , as derived from ( a ) classical md and ( b ) pimd simulations",
    "in each plot , results for three cell sizes are given : @xmath6 = 240 ( circles ) , 960 ( squares ) , and 8400 ( diamonds ) atoms .",
    "let us look first at the results of the classical simulations in fig .",
    "for the larger sizes ( 960 and 8400 atoms ) one observes first a decrease in @xmath26 for rising @xmath9 , and at higher temperatures @xmath26 increases with @xmath9 .",
    "for the smallest size presented here , the low - temperature decrease in @xmath26 is also present , although almost unobservable in the figure .",
    "moreover , one sees that the normalized in - plane surface per atom is smaller for larger simulation cells .",
    "these results are similar to those found in earlier classical monte carlo and md simulations of graphene single layers.@xcite there are two competing effects which explain this temperature dependence of @xmath26 , as discussed below .    in fig .",
    "2(b ) we present the temperature dependence of @xmath26 , as derived from pimd simulations , for the same cell sizes as in fig .",
    "this dependence is qualitatively similar to that corresponding to the classical results , but in the quantum simulations the low - temperature decrease of the in - plane area is more pronounced .",
    "this is particularly visible for the smallest size presented here ( @xmath6 = 240 ) , for which such a decrease in @xmath26 for rising @xmath9 is almost inappreciable in the classical results , whereas it is clearly visible in the results of the quantum simulations .",
    "it is important to note that , in spite of the large differences in the in - plane area per atom for the different system sizes , in each case ( classical or quantum ) all sizes converge at low @xmath9 to a single value .",
    "this could be expected because for @xmath3 the graphene sheet becomes strictly planar in the classical case and close to planar in the quantum model ( a zero - point effect ) .     for @xmath6",

    "dashed lines are guides to the eye . , width=321 ]    for a direct comparison of the in - plane area @xmath26 obtained from classical and quantum simulations ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3 both sets of results for system size @xmath6 = 960 . in the limit @xmath3",
    ", the difference between them converges to 0.022 @xmath1 .",
    "this difference decreases for rising temperature , as nuclear quantum effects become less relevant . for this system size ,",
    "the overall behavior of @xmath26 vs @xmath9 is similar for both classical and quantum models , in the sense that @xmath50 at low temperature and this derivative becomes positive at high @xmath9 .",
    "however , the slope of the @xmath26 vs @xmath9 curve at low temperature is much larger for the quantum than for the classical model .    in view of the results shown in fig .",
    "3 , it seems that @xmath51 could not vanish for @xmath3 , in disagreement with the third law of thermodynamics@xcite ( this apparent inconsistency is however not real , as shown below in sec .",
    "moreover , one can ask if @xmath26 can be treated as a true extensive variable , given that it shows a strong size effect , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . in any case",
    ", one can use @xmath26 as a helpful variable to carry out simulations of layered systems such as graphene , and indeed it is @xmath26 which defines the area of the simulation cell in the @xmath19 plane .",
    "this in - plane area has been studied earlier in several works@xcite as a function of temperature and external stress , but one can argue that it is not necessarily a variable to which one can associate properties of a real material surface .",
    "this can be further illustrated by considering a `` real '' surface @xmath52 ( in 3d space ) for graphene , as can be defined from the actual bonds between carbon atoms .",
    "thus , we define a mean area per atom from the mean c  c distance derived from the simulations , as @xmath53 ( see fig .  7 in ref .  ) .",
    "a similar expression has been used by hahn _",
    "et al._@xcite to study nanocrystalline graphene from atomistic simulations . as the actual interatomic distance changes from bond to bond in a simulation step and for each bond it fluctuates along a simulation run",
    ", @xmath52 is a mean value for a given temperature , and fluctuations of the instantaneous area depend on the fluctuations of the interatomic distance .",
    "one could employ alternative definitions for the real area , based for example on the areas of the hexagons that make up the graphene sheet , or on a triangulation based on the atomic positions .",
    "we have checked that such definitions yield area values slightly smaller than the area @xmath52 defined above , but in the present conditions ( zero applied stress and not very large out - of - plane fluctuations ) this difference is not relevant for our current purposes .    ) and 3d graphene surface ( @xmath52 ) as a function of temperature for @xmath6 = 960 atoms and zero applied stress . in both cases circles and squares",
    "show results of classical ( labeled as `` cl '' ) and quantum simulations ( labeled as `` q '' ) , respectively .",
    "error bars are less than the symbol size .",
    "dashed lines are guides to the eye . , width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "4 we show the areas @xmath52 and @xmath26 vs temperature for a simulation cell including 960 atoms . in both cases ,",
    "we present results from classical and pimd simulations .",
    "the surface @xmath52 is larger than @xmath26 , and the difference between both increases with temperature .",
    "in fact , @xmath26 is the 2d projection of @xmath52 , and the actual surface becomes increasingly bent as temperature is raised and out - of - plane atomic displacements are larger . for the area @xmath52 we do not observe the anomalous decrease displayed by @xmath26 in both classical and quantum cases at low temperature .",
    "moreover , the area @xmath52 derived from quantum simulations shows a temperature derivative @xmath54 approaching zero as @xmath3 , in agreement with low - temperature thermodynamics .    for the classical results , we find that both surfaces @xmath52 and @xmath26 converge one to the other in the low-@xmath9 limit , as expected for a convergence of the actual graphene surface to a plane when out - of - plane atomic displacements go to zero as @xmath3 . in the quantum case",
    ", @xmath52 and @xmath26 become closer as temperature is reduced , but in the low-@xmath9 limit @xmath52 is still larger than @xmath26 , and the extrapolated difference @xmath55 amounts to @xmath56 @xmath1/atom for @xmath57 .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that even for @xmath3 the graphene layer is not strictly planar due to zero - point motion of the carbon atoms in the out - of - plane direction .",
    "we now discuss the behavior of @xmath26 as a function of @xmath9 , with @xmath50 at relatively low temperature .",
    "there appears a competition between two opposite factors .",
    "on one side , the actual area @xmath52 increases as temperature is raised , as shown in fig .  4 for both classical and quantum simulations .",
    "on the other side , bending ( rippling ) of the surface causes a decrease in its 2d projection , i.e. , in @xmath26 . at low @xmath9 ,",
    "the decrease associated to out - of - plane motion dominates the thermal expansion of the actual surface , and thus @xmath50 .",
    "this is particularly marked for the quantum results , because in this case the thermal expansion at low @xmath9 is very small . at high temperature ,",
    "the increase in @xmath52 dominates the reduction in the projected area associated to out - of - plane atomic displacements . for example , for the classical results , @xmath52 increases roughly linearly with @xmath9 , but the mean - square atom displacements ( causing the reduction of @xmath26 ) grow up slower than linearly , as a consequence of anharmonicity .",
    "this is in line with the discussion given by gao and huang@xcite for the thermal behavior of @xmath26 observed in classical md simulations of a single graphene layer , as well as with the trends for @xmath51 calculated by michel _",
    "et al._@xcite    the discussion of a real area @xmath52 and a projected area @xmath26 presented here is reminiscent of the analysis carried out earlier in the context of biological membranes , where consideration of a `` true '' area is important to describe some properties of those membranes.@xcite in fact , it has been shown that values of the membrane compressibility may be very different when they are related to @xmath52 or to @xmath26 .",
    "something similar can happen for graphene , and this topic requires further research .    to summarize the results of this section , we emphasize that changes in interatomic distances and in the graphene area ( both @xmath52 and @xmath26 ) are important anharmonic effects . on one side ,",
    "changes in the distance @xmath44 and in the real area @xmath52 are mainly due to anharmonicity of the c - c stretching vibration .",
    "the dilation of the c - c bond displayed in fig .",
    "1 equally appears in a strictly planar graphene , and shows a temperature dependence similar to that of interatomic distances in solids . in real graphene , @xmath44 will be also affected by out - of - plane vibrations , which in fact couple with in - plane vibrational modes , but this coupling changes @xmath44 less than the only anharmonicity of the in - plane modes , at least for the conditions considered here . something different occurs for the projected area @xmath26 , as manifested by the strong size effect which it displays . in this case , the coupling between in - plane and out - of - plane modes is crucial to understand the temperature dependence of @xmath26 in the absence of an external stress ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the amplitude of out - of - plane vibrations strongly depend on the size @xmath6,@xcite causing the large size effect in @xmath26 . at low temperatures , all these anharmonic effects",
    "are clearly enhanced by quantum motion , as shown for example in fig .  3 for the projected area .",
    "this is due to the fact that anharmonicity is manifested in the quantum model even in the limit @xmath3 , contrary to the classical case , where it gradually appears as temperature is raised .",
    "this is further quantified and discussed in the next section .      in the zero - temperature limit",
    "we find in the classical approach a strictly planar graphene surface with an interatomic distance of 1.4199  .",
    "this corresponds to fixed atomic nuclei on the equilibrium sites without spatial delocalization , defining a minimum energy @xmath58 , taken as a reference for our calculations . in the quantum approach ,",
    "the low - temperature limit includes out - of - plane atomic fluctuations due to zero - point motion , so that the graphene layer is not strictly planar , as commented above .",
    "moreover , anharmonicity of in - plane vibrations cause a slight zero - point bond expansion , giving an interatomic distance of 1.4287  , as shown in fig .  1",
    ".    we now turn to the results of our simulations at finite temperatures , and will discuss the resulting energy for graphene . the internal energy , @xmath59 , at temperature @xmath9 can be written as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the elastic energy corresponding to an area @xmath52 , and @xmath62 is the vibrational energy of the system .",
    "our simulations directly yield @xmath59 in both classical and quantum approaches .",
    "we can then split the internal energy @xmath63 into an elastic and a vibrational part .    to define the elastic energy corresponding to an area @xmath52",
    ", we have carried out calculations of the ( classical ) energy of a supercell including 960 atoms , expanding it isotropically and keeping it flat .",
    "this strict 2d atomic layer gives us a reference to evaluate the vibrational energy .",
    "the elastic energy @xmath61 increases with @xmath52 , and for small expansion it can be approximated as @xmath64 , with @xmath65 = 2.41 ev / @xmath1 . for the area",
    "@xmath52 derived from our classical and pimd simulations at 300  k , we found elastic energies of 0.4 and 2.8 mev / atom , respectively .",
    "this much larger value for the quantum approach is a consequence of the larger surface @xmath52 , as compared to the classical limit at @xmath9 = 300  k. those values of the elastic energy increase to 20.8 and 22.9  mev / atom at 2000  k.    .",
    "the dashed line is a guide to the eye .",
    "error bars are less than the symbol size . , width=321 ]",
