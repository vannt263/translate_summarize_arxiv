    "in experiment  @xcite indications for excesses in the production of boson pairs @xmath6 were observed at invariant mass @xmath7 .",
    "data for these processes are also present in works  @xcite . despite the fact that the wouldbe effect is not finally established yet",
    ", the publication causes numerous proposals for an interpretation mostly in terms of theories beyond the standard model  @xcite , for the further exhaustive list of references see  @xcite",
    ".    however it would be advisable to consider for the beginning a possibility for a more conventional interpretation .",
    "indeed , pair of triplets @xmath8 could form a resonance state , the so - called @xmath9-ball .",
    "of course the well known gauge interaction of these bosons with coupling @xmath10 can not bind them in the resonance state with mass being of a @xmath11 scale .",
    "however , there might exist also an additional effective interaction , _",
    "e.g. _ the anomalous triple boson interaction  @xcite , which increases with increasing energy scale . in case",
    "the interaction becomes sufficiently strong at a @xmath11 scale , it might lead to a formation of a resonance under discussion .",
    "we shall consider this possibility in more details below .",
    "but firstly we would discuss if this option could be reconciled with present data  @xcite .",
    "let us assume an existence of a resonance in a system of two @xmath9-s .",
    "there are few options in the framework of the assumption .",
    "boson w has the unity weak isotopic spin .",
    "thus a resonance can have one of possible three values of the isotopic spin : @xmath12 .",
    "there is also a correlation of values of a spin and an isotopic spin .",
    "there are the following options for low spin resonances .",
    "resonance @xmath13 with spin 1 and isotopic spin 1 .",
    "then it can not have decay channel to @xmath14 and so it does not correspond to data  @xcite .",
    "resonances @xmath15 with spin 0 , where a subscript indicate a value of an isotopic spin .",
    "the first option @xmath16 is excluded due to the presence in data  @xcite of the decay channel @xmath17 .    thus we are left with option @xmath18 of a scalar resonance with the isotopic spin two . under this premise",
    "we have the following effective interaction @xmath19 and five charge states of @xmath20 @xmath21 interaction  ( [ gxww ] ) corresponds to the following form of the effective vertices for different charge states with momenta and indices of @xmath9-s @xmath22 @xmath23 for the neutral boson we have as usually the weinberg mixture of the @xmath24-boson and the photon @xmath25 effective coupling constant @xmath26 is related to width @xmath27 of the resonance @xmath28 data  @xcite allow to estimate @xmath27 to be few hundreds gev by an order of magnitude .",
    "thus we shall present estimates of cross sections for three values of the width @xmath29    with values for effective couplings  ( [ widthn ] ) and the mass of the resonance @xmath30 we calculate cross sections of the resonances production at two energies : @xmath31 for the sake of comparison with data  @xcite and @xmath32 in view of a prediction of possible effects at the upgraded lhc .",
    "calculations are performed with application of comphep package  @xcite and a necessary information from pdg  @xcite .",
    "the results are presented in tables .    in the last six lines of the tables we show results with no difference in sign of @xmath33 charge and specification of the neutral component to be either @xmath24 or the photon , that could be confronted with data  @xcite .",
    "we see , that cross sections being around few @xmath34 for channels @xmath0 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 at @xmath31 qualitatively correspond to data collected with integral luminosity @xmath37 . for more definite conclusions one has to wait for hopefully forthcoming new data . in any case",
    "the most promising process here is a production of same positive sign @xmath9 pairs .",
    "+ cross sections of x states production for @xmath31 at the lhc and different channels for three values of the total width .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "now let us consider a possibility of a heavy resonance in case of an existence of the anomalous three - boson interaction , which in conventional notations looks like @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the electro - weak coupling .",
    "the best limitations for parameter @xmath1 read  @xcite @xmath40 where a subscript denote a neutral boson being involved in the experimental definition of @xmath1 .",
    "sources of results for @xmath1 see  @xcite . let us emphasize that @xmath41 in definition  ( [ fff ] ) denotes a form - factor , which is either postulated as in original works  @xcite or it is just uniquely defined as in works on a spontaneous generation of effective interaction  ( [ fff ] )  @xcite . in any case",
    "the form - factor guarantees the effective interaction to act in a limited region of the momentum space .",
    "that is it vanishes for momenta exceeding scale @xmath42 .",
    "we shall see that for the problem under discussion this scale has to be of order of magnitude of few @xmath11 .",
    "let us present the expression for the form - factor , which was obtained in the approach  @xcite for special kinematics @xmath43",
    "@xmath44    here @xmath45 is a meijer function  @xcite ( see also convenient set of necessary formulas in book  @xcite ) .",
    "interaction constant @xmath46 in relations  ( [ formfactor ] ) is connected with conventional definitions in the following way @xmath47 calculations were done in the framework of an approximate scheme , which accuracy was estimated to be @xmath48  @xcite . would - be existence of effective interaction  ( [ fff ] )",
    "leads to important non - perturbative effects in the electro - weak interaction .",
    "in particular , one might expect resonances to appear in the system of two @xmath8-bosons .",
    "a possibility of an appearance of such states ( w - balls ) was already discussed , _",
    "e.g. _ in works  @xcite .",
    "let us consider a bethe - salpeter equation for a scalar bound state or a resonance consisting of two @xmath9 .",
    "we have already noted , that such state can have two values of the weak isospin : @xmath49 .    ) .",
    "simple lines represent @xmath9-s , a double line corresponds to the resonance , black circles correspond to interaction  ( [ fff ] ) . ]    with interaction  ( [ fff ] ) we have the following equation for a spin zero state in correspondence to diagrams presented in fig 1 .",
    "@xmath50 where @xmath51 is an isotopic factor , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 being an external and an internal momentum in euclidean four - momentum space , @xmath56 with @xmath57 being euclidean four - momentum squared of the resonance state .",
    "form - factor f(y ) of effective interaction  ( [ fff ] ) is introduced in the constant term of the equation . here in view of large value @xmath3 of the wouldbe resonance",
    "we neglect @xmath9 mass , and isotopic factor @xmath58 is defined for different values of the total isospin @xmath59 as follows @xmath60    in equation  ( [ eq : bs2 ] ) we have introduced a dependence on momentum @xmath61 of the bound state only in the first constant term in the rhs part .",
    "this corresponds to approximation which is used in the approach  @xcite .",
    "the effective cut - off parameter @xmath62 in  ( [ eq : bs2 ] ) is the same parameter , which was used in works  @xcite in the course of studies of a spontaneous generation of interaction  ( [ fff ] ) and is defined by relations in  ( [ formfactor ] )    with the following substitution for variables with account of  ( [ formfactor ] ) @xmath63 we come to the following equation for the weak isotopic spin @xmath64 @xmath65 equation  ( [ eq : bsz ] ) being homogenous we choose solution under condition @xmath66 , that means @xmath67 by successive differentiations of equation  ( [ eq : bsz ] ) we obtain a meijer differential equation for function @xmath68 @xmath69 then we look for the solution in terms of meijer functions ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) in the following form @xmath70 the substitution of  ( [ eq : solc ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : bsz ] ) with condition  ( [ eq : norm ] ) gives unique definition of constants : @xmath71 then we substitute solution  ( [ eq : solc],[c12 ] ) and form - factor  ( [ formfactor ] ) into normalization condition  ( [ eq : norm ] ) and thus define parameter @xmath72 , which according to  ( [ eq : zy ] ) is connected with the mass of the resonance @xmath73 .",
    "let us note , that in relation  ( [ eq : norm ] ) one has to calculate the cauchy principal value of the integral .",
    "namely , for @xmath74 in  ( [ eq : norm ] ) we have @xmath75 . with @xmath72 increasing @xmath76 also increases and @xmath77 for @xmath78 then from definitions  ( [ glam ] ) and  ( [ eq : zy ] ) we have for @xmath79 @xmath80 where the sign is defined in the framework of the approach  @xcite due to the condition of coupling constant @xmath46 to be positive .",
    "this value agrees limitations  ( [ lambda1 ] ) .",
    "according to relations  ( [ formfactor],[glam ] ) , value  ( [ eq : lam ] ) corresponds to the following effective cut - off parameter @xmath81 where we take into account already mentioned @xmath82 uncertainty inherent to the model .",
    "result  ( [ lambda ] ) demonstrates a natural appearance of @xmath11 scale in the model . with account of the uncertainty in  ( [ lambda ] ) our estimate  ( [ eq : lam ] ) is to be changed for @xmath83 this result being more reliable than  ( [ eq : lam ] ) also is quite compatible with limitations  ( [ lambda1 ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that for a wouldbe state with isotopic spin zero according to  ( [ eq : ai ] ) there is an overall factor @xmath84 in equation  ( [ eq : bs2 ] ) .",
    "the analogous procedure leads to the conclusion that there is no appropriate solution of the problem .",
    "we conclude , that only isotopic spin two state may be present in the framework of the present model .",
    "thus we consider possible five resonant states with approximate mass @xmath85 , which decay into @xmath86 here we have to bear in mind relation  ( [ weinberg ] ) , which connect field @xmath87 with physical fields of the @xmath24 boson and of the photon .",
    "results of calculations for cross sections of these states production are shown in tables 1,2 .",
    "the results can be reliably checked in forthcoming experiments at lhc with @xmath88 .    assuming a spontaneous generation of the anomalous triple weak bosons interaction  ( [ fff ] ) we predict value @xmath1  ( [ eq : lam1 ] ) , which also has an opportunity to be checked at the upgraded lhc .",
