    "for many years now , low - dimensional quantum systems have been a hotbed of theoretical and experimental novelties .",
    "quasi one - dimensional spin systems have by now become fertile laboratories for the investigation of many interesting phenomena stemming from strong correlations , an important example being charge fractionalization of physical excitations .",
    "overall , spin-@xmath0 heisenberg chains count among the most important paradigms .",
    "this stems first from the existence of many exact results on their ground - state , excitations and thermodynamics in a variety of cases , but also on the growing number of experimental situations in which the effective theory boils down to a one - dimensional exchange hamiltonian .",
    "exact results on quantum spin chains ( by which we mean solvability at the lattice level ) are constrained to either easy - plane anisotropy in nonzero longitudinal field ( so spin projection along the field axis is a good quantum number , and spinon excitations are well - defined ) ( for a full exposition of this well - known subject , see _ e.g. _ [ ] ) , or zero field and general anisotropy @xcite . recently , however , there has been renewed interest in the study of spin chains in the more general case of transverse field and anisotropy [ ] , where all symmetries are broken and exact solutions are out of reach .",
    "most notably , the main motivation for the present study originates from extensive work done on the field - dependent ground - state properties and excitation dynamics of quasi - one - dimensional anisotropic antiferromagnets like @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we will consider the hamiltonian of the generally anisotropic heisenberg chain in a field given by @xmath3 \\label{hspins}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the spin-1/2 operators @xmath4 obey the commutation relations @xmath5 = i \\delta_{j j ' } \\epsilon^{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma }   s^{\\gamma}_j$ ] .",
    "this model shares many features with somewhat simpler and better understood exchange hamiltonians like the @xmath6 @xcite or @xmath7 @xcite models .",
    "as far as the @xmath6 model is concerned , many exact results are known in the presence of a field @xcite , like the existence of an ising - class disordering transition at a critical value of the field .",
    "general space- and time - dependent correlation functions can be obtained by mapping to gapped noninteracting fermions @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is well - known that the isotropic antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain , and more generally the @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) chain in a field parallel to the anisotropy ( with @xmath9 ) , is a gapless system with no long - range order and an unbroken @xmath10 symmetry . once again",
    ", many results are known on the thermodynamics @xcite while recent progress has been achieved on correlation functions both on the lattice @xcite and in the scaling limit @xcite .    for the fully anisotropic model in a field ( [ hspins ] ) , however , precious little is known . in zero field ,",
    "the model becomes exactly solvable @xcite , meaning that thermodynamic properties are computable @xcite .",
    "correlation functions in zero field are still unknown in general ( with the exception of the baxter - kelland formula @xcite for the one - point function giving the staggered magnetization ) , although some special cases have been studied @xcite .",
    "the distinguishing feature of ( [ hspins ] ) is that one can find two independent origins for a gap : first , in zero field , the very presence of structural anisotropy breaks the symmetry right from the start .",
    "one could also break the symmetry by applying a field transverse to the anisotropy ( like in the case of an @xmath7 magnet with field along the @xmath11 direction ) . in both of these cases ,",
    "long - range nel order develops .",
    "however , the noncommuting nature of the field with respect to the anisotropy and the fact that the field strength is tunable lead to the existence of quantum critical behaviour in the system : for large enough fields , fluctuations become strong enough to disorder the ground - state , leading to an ising - class critical point at a field @xmath12 ( whose value depends on the anisotropy ) .",
    "this holds true for a general anisotropic chain , studied in [ ] , in which bounds were obtained for the critical field , and rigorous results were derived on classical ground states for particular values of the field ( meaning that the ground - state becomes a two - sublattice nel - type state , with nonzero long - range antiferromagnetic order ) .",
    "exact results being inaccessible for now , one must rely on alternative methods to compute quantities of interest like the magnetization along the field , transverse order and objects like the dynamical structure factor . close to a gapless ,",
    "solvable point , one can rely on approaches like bosonization to obtain various scaling results ( _ e.g. _ weak field and/or small anisotropy limits studied in ) .",
    "however , the presence of a gap justifies the hope that a mean - field scheme might work out relatively well as a quantitative theory provided the correct starting point is identified .",
    "this was initiated in [ ] for the @xmath7 chain in a transverse field , where the phase diagram and various scaling results were obtained .",
    "correlation functions were afterwards studied in [ ] using the equivalence to the @xmath6 model in a field , and through the use of perturbative rg shemes based on sine - gordon form factors .",
    "some of these results are in fact immediately generalizable to the @xmath1 chain in a field that we purport to study .",
    "one thing that was missing , however , was an estimate of the strength of fluctuations , which is of particular importance in view of potential quantitative comparisons with experiments . for low fields , the mean - field approach failed by construction to properly describe the restoration of the @xmath10 symmetry of the @xmath7 chain .",
    "the mean - field staggered magnetization , for example , failed to vanish at zero field , in clear contradiction with the exact result .",
    "the field dependence of the gap also failed for small fields , disagreeing with both experiments and numerical results using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) .",
    "one might ask whether dmrg or other quasi - exact methods would suffice to describe all aspects of experiments , but its main drawback is that it is only very useful as a tool for investigating properties of the ground - state and lowest - lying states , and is not yet an economical tool for dynamical quantities like spin correlation functions , measurable using neutron scattering .",
    "our general idea is therefore quite simple : to carefully compute fluctuations around mean - field to two loops , providing an improved setup from which values for the thermodynamic ( and eventually dynamic ) properties of the system , and quantitative estimates of the precision of the mean - field theory can be obtained through the use of intensive numerics on the resulting equations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the basic mean - field setup is presented .",
    "fluctuations around mean - field are computed in section iii , and used to determine corrections to physical parameters , the specific heat , and the excitation gap .",
    "section iv presents a comparison of our approximations in zero field with the exact results available from the bethe ansatz , and conclusions are collected in section v.",
    "written as it is , ( [ hspins ] ) is not tractable in any simple way . to make progress , we move from a spin basis to a simpler fermion one by using the jordan - wigner transformation @xmath13 , @xmath14 , under which the hamiltonian gets transformed to a theory of interacting fermions in the presence of a superconducting - like cooper pairing term : @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions along the lattice on the spin operators , so @xmath17 .",
    "the fermion operators are thus taken to have antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "we shall restrict the exchange parameters to the domain @xmath18 , therefore concentrating on the antiferromagnetic regime .",
    "note that ( [ hspins ] ) is not quite the most general anisotropic exchange hamiltonian in a field that we could have started from : pointing the ( field , or equivalently the ) anisotropy in a completely general direction would entail terms of the form @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the absence of @xmath21 and @xmath22 exchange terms is here required to ensure a local fermionic theory .",
    "the interacting fermion hamiltonian ( [ hfermions ] ) is not exactly solvable because of the simultaneous presence of the pairing - like term @xmath23 , originating from the transversality of the magnetic field and @xmath24 anisotropy , and the external magnetic field .",
    "we therefore use the approximation scheme proposed in [ ] and elaborated in [ ] .",
    "let us recall here the basics of this setup .",
    "first , the fermionic interaction term is decomposed via the ( site independent ) mean - field parameters @xmath25 corresponding to the magnetization , kinetic and pairing terms respectively .",
    "the angular brackets with subscript @xmath26 signify thermal averages using the mean - field states .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian becomes an exactly solvable free fermion theory ( corresponding to an effective anisotropic @xmath6 model in a field ) , @xmath27 in which @xmath28 , and @xmath29 the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 are thus simply interpreted physically as effective bandwidth , effective superconductivity - like pairing , and effective chemical potential .",
    "the ground - state is therefore @xmath32-like and contains all particle numbers . performing a fourier",
    "transform to momentum space using @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and choosing @xmath36 even for convenience , we can write @xmath37 using the nambu spinor @xmath38",
    ". the theory can easily be rediagonalized as @xmath39 with bogoliubov - de gennes transformation parameters @xmath40 @xmath41^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath42 .",
    "the dispersion relation is @xmath43^{1/2 } \\label{omegak}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and makes manifest the presence of the gap in the theory .",
    "now , in terms of the new fermions , we sit always precisely at half - filling , and the ground - state is characterized by a fully filled lower band .",
    "particle - hole excitations correspond to spinon - like excitations in the original spin model : exactly as in the @xmath6 model , due to energy - momentum conservation two - particle processes dominate below the critical field , whereas above it one - particle processes give the strongest contribution to correlation functions .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the model at the mean - field level are easily obtained from the mean - field free energy per site at inverse temperature @xmath44 , @xmath45 explicitly , in the limit @xmath46 , we get @xmath47 the mean - field setup is completed by requiring that the following self - consistency equations be satisfied : @xmath48 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!{\\cal k}_0 \\!=\\ !",

    "these are easily solved numerically with a simple iterative procedure .",
    "consequence is that all mean - field parameters , and therefore all effective potentials appearing in the mean - field hamiltonian , acquire a temperature dependence .",
    "the average energy per site in the mean - field approximation is itself simply given by @xmath50 the mean - field specific heat is defined for fixed external field @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the fluctuations around mean - field can be described using standard perturbative expansions by reinstating the original fermionic interaction term in the hamiltonian ( [ hmf ] ) . in detail , the perturbation that we have to deal with reads @xmath53 c^{\\dagger}_{k_n } c_{k_n } + % \\right .",

    "we are being pedantic with the momenta , since we keep all finite @xmath36 corrections in the computations ( this turns out to help the numerics perceptibly , since we can realistically plot our functions for @xmath36 only of the order of a few hundred ) . since we are interested in equilibrium thermodynamic quantities , the perturbative computations are most easily tackled using the imaginary time ( @xmath56 ) formalism .",
    "first , we define the matsubara green s functions as appropriate averages over the mean - field theory ( represented everywhere by @xmath57 ) .",
    "we need two types of functions , one representing normal correlations and the other , pairing correlations : @xmath58 the most convenient representation , exhibiting the poles in the normal and cooper channels , is obtained after fourier transforming to frequency space ( we use the definitions @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) @xmath62 all physical quantities of interest can be computed using these functions , in particular the unperturbed mean - field parameters : @xmath63    the full green s functions in imaginary time are defined as @xmath64 where the angular brackets denote a thermal average over the full hamiltonian @xmath65 .",
    "the perturbation expansion can then be formally written down as the series ( here in the normal green s function ) @xmath66 in which all correlators are now evaluated at mean - field level .",
    "to first order in perturbation theory , fluctuations do not correct the mean - field green s functions ( by definition ) .",
    "the first corrections appear at second order , where for each type of green s function 12 different diagrams can be written down . summing these after chopping external legs provides a computation of the self - energies to two loops .",
    "after a relatively lengthy computation , the self - energies to second order ( as identified by the superscript ) can be written down as ( after summation over internal matsubara frequencies , only the sum over the two internal momenta @xmath67 remains ) @xmath68 where the `` normal '' and `` cooper '' self - energies both receive contributions from normal and cooper channels .",
    "explicitly , we write those contributions as    @xmath69 d_{\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 } ( k , i\\omega | k_1 , k_2 ) + \\tilde{\\delta } t_n^c , \\nonumber \\\\ \\!\\!\\!\\!t_s ( k , i\\omega | k_1 , k_2 ) \\!\\!&=&\\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    "the momentum weight factors are trigonometric functions given by ( we remind the reader that @xmath78 ; moreover , since we sum over the full brillouin zone , the umklapp terms are explicitly included in our expressions ) @xmath79 the finite @xmath36 correction terms included in the self - energy expressions ( [ t ] ) are finally given by @xmath80 in which ( for @xmath81 )    @xmath82 ( f^b_+ ( k_2 ) f^c_+ ( k_2 )   + f^b_- ( k_2 ) f^c_- ( k_2 ) ) n_{\\beta } ( \\omega(k_2 ) ( 1 - n_{\\beta } ( \\omega(k_2)))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and where we have used the notations @xmath83    it is evident that the self - energies manifestly obey the same symmetries as the green s functions , namely @xmath84    at this stage , a perturbative ( partial ) resummation can naturally and easily be performed using dyson s equation .",

    "for example , the relative error at @xmath98 for @xmath99 has gone from 12.5 percent for the mean - field versus dmrg result , to 1.9 percent for fluctuations versus dmrg .",

    "the comparisons with dmrg and ( for zero field ) with the bethe ansatz that we have provided are a good guide to establishing the relative numerical precision to be expected from our theory , which ranges from very good for the `` worst - case '' scenario of a gapless @xmath7 chain , to essentially indistinguishable from the exact solution ( errors of order 0.2 percent ) for spin chains with strong structural @xmath1 anisotropy . in broad terms , an increase in precision of at least an order of magnitude is achieved by incorporating the fluctuations as we have done here , which makes our approach good enough for many practical purposes . here , we have concentrated on equilibrium thermodynamic quantities like magnetization , and basic dynamical - related ones like the excitation gap .",
