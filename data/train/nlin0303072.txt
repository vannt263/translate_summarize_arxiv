    "among the variety of known mechanisms of spontaneous pattern formation in spatially extended chemical systems , the flow distributed oscillation ( fdo ) mechanism @xcite-@xcite differs from the turing @xcite and related mechanisms@xcite and from the differential flow instability@xcite@xcite in that it does not require any differential transport of the reacting species .",
    "the fdo mechanism , which was predicted@xcite@xcite physically interpreted and experimentally verified@xcite-@xcite , operates in open flow systems when the chemical kinetics is intrinsically oscillatory and the inflow boundary condition plays an essential role .",
    "it is potentially relevant to biological pattern formation involving an axial growth , since an open flow system is related by a coordinate transformation to a linearly growing medium such as a plant stem or animal embryo.@xcite-@xcite    the governing equations of the one - dimensional open reactive flow studied are the reaction - diffusion - advection  ( rda ) equation @xmath0 together with the boundary condition  @xmath1  at the inflow .  here",
    "@xmath2  is an @xmath3-dimensional vector of dynamical variables ( concentrations of species ) ,  @xmath4 is the vector - valued rate function which depends on one or more control parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the flow velocity and @xmath7 is the diffusion coefficient .  in general @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    "can be matrices , allowing for differential transport , but here we focus on the case without differential transport , so that @xmath8 and @xmath7 are real scalars .",
    "we take the length of the reactor to be @xmath9 and impose no - flux boundary conditions at the outflow :  @xmath10 .",
    "we are interested in the case where @xmath11 has a stable limit cycle and at least one unstable fixed point .",
    "insight into the physical mechanism of flow - distributed waves can be gained by considering the _ kinematic limit _",
    "@xcite of zero diffusion .  in this case equation ( [ rdaeq ]",
    ") can be written as@xmath12 where we have introduced the advective derivative @xmath13 .",
    "then the evolution of an advected fluid element is the same as that of the well - mixed system : each fluid element is an independent oscillator or batch reactor , and the inflow boundary condition serves to establish the phase of  these oscillators.@xcite  if the boundary condition is constant , for example , then all of the oscillators enter the reactor with the same initial phase and stationary waves result from the recurrence of the same phase at equally spaced downstream positions .  on the other hand , an oscillating boundary condition leads to upstream or downstream travelling waves , which have also been verified experimentally.@xcite-@xcite  while the kinematic limit is helpful for understanding the essential physics ,  there are significant deviations from its predictions when diffusion becomes significant @xmath14 these deviations affect the wavelengths@xcite  as well as the amplitudes and shapes of flow distributed waves .",
    "the path in phase space of a volume element moving through the reactor may differ from that of the well - stirred system with the same initial conditions.@xcite  sufficiently strong diffusion can extinguish the waves due to the diffusive mixing of adjacent fluid elements which are oscillating out of phase .",
    "an alternative aproach to this kinematic or phase dynamics picture is the original @xcite@xcite linear stability analysis which views the flow - distributed oscillations as arising from growing perturbations of an unstable uniform stationary state @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an unstable fixed point of the underlying kinetics governed by @xmath4 .",
    "this linearized analysis is useful for predicting which small perturbations initially grow and which do not and it has been used in a variety of systems to determine thresholds for the formation of wave patterns ( for example , the bifurcation from growing to evanescent stationary waves . )  however , the linearized analysis is not sufficient to determine the behavior of the waves when their amplitude becomes large .  as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the linearized analysis is most useful when the kinetic system is not far from a supercritical hopf bifurcation . in this case , it can give a good approximation to the wavelength of the fully developed nonlinear waves , although by itself it is inadequate to predict their amplitude or shape .",
    "chemical oscillators , however , have interesting dynamical regimes far from a hopf bifurcation , showing markedly non - sinusoidal or relaxation oscillations .  in such cases ,",
    "the fixed point enclosed by the limit cycle may be an unstable node rather than a focus , in which case a linearized analysis near the fixed point does not reveal the intrinsic oscillatory behavior at all .",
    "the behavior of large perturbations can then be radically different from that of small ones .",
    "our goal in this work is to develop a general formalism that describes both stationary and travelling flow - distributed waves including their nonlinear behavior and deviations from the kinematic limit .",
    "this formalism provides a unifying framework for understanding previous results and it can be applied to arbitrary kinetic models .",
    "in contrast to previous studies of particular kinetic models@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , our emphasis is on generic phenomena . in particular",
    "we hope to shed light on systems with relaxation or other non - sinusoidal oscillations , where the unstable fixed point is a node rather than a focus .  in section",
    "ii we discuss the linear stability analysis of a fixed point with an emphasis on generic features of the two types of fixed points , unstable foci and unstable nodes .",
    "we derive a general dispersion relation for small - amplitude disturbances and use it to analyze the response to time - dependent perturbations imposed at the inflow .",
    "we show that a band of frequencies is spatially amplified , and that this band becomes narrower and sharper with increasing diffusion .",
    "we derive general expressions for the thresholds separating absolute from convective instability as well as the threshold for extinction of stationary waves and show that the latter threshold disappears in the case of an unstable node .",
    "if the system is far from a hopf bifurcation , we show that , in contrast to previous examples , it is possible for sustained stationary waves to arise through an absolute instability from a transient perturbation .  in section",
    "iii we use a travelling wave ansatz to introduce a reduced one - dimensional ordinary differential equation ( ode ) that describes the fully nonlinear stationary and travelling waves .",
    "numerical solutions of this equation are easier to obtain than those of the partial differential equation ( [ rdaeq ] ) and they allow us to obtain the _ nonlinear dispersion relation _  for the fully developed , large amplitude waves .",
    "a key result is that the amplitude and shape of the wave depend only on the reduced transport parameter @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the phase velocity of the wave .",
    "it is @xmath19 that governs the strength of deviations from the kinematic limit .",
    "we show that in the case of relaxation oscillations these deviations are qualitatively different from those in the quasi - sinusoidal case ,  and we provide a physical interpretation of the dependence on @xmath19 .",
    "we illustrate the application of our techniques by some numerical results .",
    "finally , in section iv we summarize our conclusions and describe the prospects for applying our techniques to more complex types of bifurcations ( canards , period doublings , etc . )  in open flow systems .     throughout the paper we use as an illustrative model the van der pol or fitzhugh - nagumo ( fn ) oscillator@xcite@xcite@xcite@xmath20 which is described in more detail in appendix a.  the fn model exhibits the generic features we are interested in",
    ":  it provides examples of quasi - sinusoidal oscillations changing to relaxation oscillations and an unstable focus changing to an unstable node as @xmath21 is increased .",
    "similar qualitative features occur in the brusselator , oregonator and other kinetic models .",
    "appendix b describes the numerical approaches used and challenges encountered in solving the 1-d ode described in section iii .",
    "in this section we pursue the approach which views flow - distributed waves as arising from instabilities of the spatially uniform solution  @xmath22 of equation ( [ rdaeq ] ) .",
    "the systems of interest possess an unstable fixed point and a stable limit cycle .",
    "the instability of the uniform state may be either convective or absolute.@xcite@xcite@xcite  we now consider small perturbations @xmath23 @xmath24 of the homogeneous fixed point @xmath25  in the linearized approximation , @xmath23 obeys@xmath26 where @xmath27 is the jacobian matrix @xmath28  let us denote the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the jacobian by @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively ( @xmath31 ) and expand the perturbation @xmath23 in the eigenbasis as @xmath32 substitution into the linearized equation gives a separate equation for each component:@xmath33    we are interested in the dynamics along unstable eigenvectors ,  i.e. , ones for which the real part of @xmath30 is positive .",
    "@xmath30 may be one of a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues @xmath34 with @xmath35 positive ,  in which case @xmath16 is an unstable focus ,  or it may be purely real and positive , as for an unstable node .  in general , the former case occurs in the neighborhood of a supercritical hopf bifurcation , while the latter  may occur farther from the bifurcation .",
    "the component equation associated with the eigenvector @xmath36 can be written as@xmath37 without loss of generality we can assume that @xmath38 .",

    "the dispersion relation can not be solved with a purely real @xmath42 . )",
    "@xmath57@xmath57from this we learn that a perturbation with @xmath53 always yields a growing mode ( the hopf mode ) in which the whole reactor oscillates in phase .",
    "in fact , we shall see that @xmath58 is the midpoint of a band of amplified frequencies .",
    "the edges of the amplified band can be derived by setting @xmath59 in eqs .",
    "( [ dispreal ] ) and ( [ dispim ] ) and solving for @xmath60 .",
    "the result is that sinusoidal perturbations are spatially amplified if @xmath61 and they are damped otherwise .",
    "if @xmath62 then @xmath63 falls outside the range of amplified frequencies and the stationary waves decay .       an important distinction in the dynamics of open flow systems is the one between absolute and convective instability .  if a state is _ convectively unstable _ , then perturbations of the state grow in a reference frame moving with the flow velocity , but for any fixed position in the laboratory frame the disturbance eventually decays .",
    "the effects of a perturbation of finite duration are eventually washed downstream and out of the system and the reactor returns to its initial unperturbed state .  in this case , the initial conditions at @xmath64 do not influence the asymptotic late - time behavior , which is instead controlled by the upstream boundary condition .  if a state is _ absolutely unstable _",
    ", on the other hand , then localized perturbations grow with time at a fixed position in the laboratory frame , propagating upstream as well as downstream .",
    "this means that perturbations applied at @xmath64 continue to affect the state at late times .  from an experimental point of view",
    ",  the continuing effect of noise in the initial conditions makes an absolutely system more complicated .",
    "since the disturbances propagate in both directions , the system resembles a pure reaction - diffusion system where the flow plays a subordinate role .",
    "the critical slowing - down near the convective / absolute instability threshold adds to the experimental difficulty .",
    "a convectively unstable system can be controlled more readily by manipulating the inflow boundary condition .",
    "the distinction between the two cases can be expressed in terms of the _ group velocity _ of propagating disturbances.@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite if there are modes with positive growth rate and upstream ( negative ) group velocity then the instability is absolute  otherwise , all growing disturbances are washed downstream .  the threshold between the two cases occurs when a mode with zero group velocity  @xmath65 has exactly zero growth with respect to time , @xmath49 .",
    "this represents a persistent disturbance that is not washed downstream .  from the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) the condition of zero group velocity is @xmath66 or@xmath67 giving a purely imaginary wave number which can be substituted into both components of the dispersion relation ( [ dispreal ] ) and ( [ dispim ] ) .",
    "the threshold for absolute instability occurs when the temporal growth rate @xmath68 is exactly zero for this zero - group - velocity mode , so from the real component ( [ dispreal ] ) we get@xmath69 or@xmath70  from the imaginary component ( [ dispim ] ) we get that @xmath71 , which tells us that the first mode to go absolutely unstable is the hopf mode .     note that eq .",
    "( [ aithreshold ] )  is the same threshold mentioned above in discussing the solutions of ( [ dispreal ] ) and ( [ dispim ] ) .",
    "it is the threshold beyond which the most unstable mode grows with time as well as space and therefore its frequency can not be purely real .      to illustrate the above results generically ,",
    "it is helpful to express the dispersion relation in terms of dimensionless variables .",
    "this requires a choice of a characteristic time scale .",
    "it is convenient to use the growth time scale @xmath72 and introduce the variables @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .  for real @xmath77 the two components ( [ dispreal ] ) and ( [ dispim ] ) of the dispersion relation can be rewritten as@xmath78@xmath79",
    "numerical solutions for @xmath80 and @xmath81 as functions of @xmath82 are plotted in figure [ relaxdisp ]  for several values of @xmath83 .",
    "the family of curves illustrates the qualitative features of the response to sinusoidal forcing : the band of amplified frequencies becomes becomes sharper and narrower with increasing @xmath84 and the plot of the wavenumber @xmath80 versus @xmath77 becomes more strongly nonlinear .",
    "the maximum growth rate always occurs at @xmath85 .",
    "the onset of absolute instability occurs when @xmath86  and is marked by the appearance of a cusp in @xmath81 and a vertical jump in @xmath80 at @xmath85 .  in the kinematic limit @xmath87",
    "all frequencies are amplified equally and @xmath80 is a linear function of @xmath88 .",
    "[ ptb ]    relaxdisp.eps      in the preceding paragraphs we have derived results for the linear stability analysis of perturbations along a single eigendirection near a fixed point of the dynamics .",
    "the results are formally independent of whether the fixed point is a focus or a node",
    ".  the latter case can be described simply by considering @xmath39 .  however , there are important qualitative differences between the two cases .  in the case of an unstable focus ,",
    "the eigenvalues are complex conjugates and trajectories spiral away from the fixed point .",
    "there is a single growth rate @xmath35 .  for a node ,",
    "on the other hand , there is no intrinsic oscillatory behavior near the fixed point and any oscillation must be imposed externally or arise from nonlinear effects at larger amplitudes .",
    "there are generally two eigendirections associated with distinct growth rates @xmath89 and therefore different dispersion relations and instability thresholds for perturbations along the two eigendirections .",
    "perturbations grow most rapidly along the most unstable eigendirection and therefore this eigendirection is physically the most important .",
    "another difference between the two cases is that for a focus ( @xmath90 )  the most unstable mode is always the hopf mode which is a uniform oscillation at frequency @xmath58 .",
    "the band of amplified perturbations is centered on this nonzero frequency , which is also the first mode to become absolutely unstable .",
    "when @xmath91 on the other hand , the most unstable mode ( and the first to become absolutely unstable ) is a stationary mode with @xmath92  the linearized dispersion relation predicts a real component of the wavenumber @xmath93 for this mode .",
    "however , when the amplitude grows , the nonlinear terms grow rapidly with the result that large - amplitude oscillation and stationary waves of finite wavelength take over .  the different nature of the absolute instability threshold between the two cases is illustrated with numerical results in figure [ aicombined ] .",
    "the emergence of sustained stationary waves due to absolute instability from a time - limited perturbation ( fig .",
    "[ aicombined]b ) is in sharp contrast to previous examples@xcite@xcite  in which the first absolutely unstable mode was time - dependent ( as in fig .",
    "[ aicombined]a ) and stationary waves in the absolutely unstable regime only occured in a thin boundary region , if at all , and only in response to a steady boundary condition held away from the fixed point .",
    "[ ptb ]    aicombined.eps      in a reactive flow experiment , it is typically the flow velocity which is under the experimenter s control while the diffusion constant is fixed .",
    "one focus of previous studies has therefore been the determination of critical flow velocities at which the fdo  patterns change qualitatively .",
    "two important thresholds are the threshold for the formation of undamped stationary patterns @xmath94 and the threshold between absolute and convective instability , @xmath95 using the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "general expressions for these threshold velocities are readily obtained from ( [ statthreshhold ] ) and ( [ aithreshold]):@xmath96 where the dependence on kinetic control parameters @xmath5 has been made explicit .",
    "these thresholds were plotted as functions of a control parameter for particular systems in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite and @xcite .",
    "we can now understand some generic features of the shapes of these bifurcation loci observed in those works .  near a supercritical hopf bifurcation ,  @xmath94 diverges and @xmath97 because @xmath98 .  in a range above the hopf bifurcation , then , @xmath99 and there are three dynamical regimes as the flow velocity is varied .  at high velocities ,",
    "there are sustained stationary waves which can be excited by fixed boundary conditions .  for @xmath100 ,",
    "the stationary waves are _ evanescent _ and penetrate only a limited distance into the medium .  after any initial transients are convectively washed out of the system , the remainder of the system returns to the fixed point .",
    "thus there is a range of @xmath8 values for which the unstable fixed point is effectively stabilized in the presence of constant boundary conditions .",
    "( however , oscillatory perturbations in the amplified band still result in undamped travelling waves . )  as a control parameter is tuned farther away from the hopf bifurcation , @xmath101 generally increases , and the two curves @xmath102 and @xmath103 may cross ( see , for example , figure 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) so that for some values of @xmath5 , @xmath104 .  in this case",
    "there is no intermediate regime of evanescent waves followed by return to the fixed point as described above .",
    "instead , as the velocity is lowered , the absolute instability threshold is reached first .  below @xmath105",
    ",  the effects of initial conditions at @xmath64 are not washed out of the system  and the late - time behavior may not be controllable by the boundary condition .",
    "the most unstable modes dominate , and stationary waves may occur only in a boundary layer with constant boundary conditions .",
    "it is possible that the crossing of the two thresholds ( @xmath104 ) accounts in part for the failure to observe evanescent stationary waves in experiments.@xcite@xcite  in some cases ,  as @xmath5 is tuned still further from a hopf bifurcation , @xmath106 may decrease to zero , and the threshold @xmath94 vanishes as the fixed point becomes an unstable node .  in this case ,",
    "stationary waves may be triggered by an absolute instability as mentioned above .",
    "in this section we derive a reduced ordinary differential equation ( ode ) that describes both stationary and travelling wave solutions of the rda equation ( [ rdaeq ] ) and that applies to situations where neither the linear stability analysis nor the kinematic limit give an adequate description .",
    "we show that the amplitude and wave form depend on a single reduced transport parameter which  characterizes the degree of departure from the kinematic limit .",
    "the application of our formalism is then illustrated by some numerical examples .",
    "as in the linearized analysis , we find that the two cases near and far from a hopf bifurcation give qualitatively different wave behavior .",
    "we make the _ ansatz _ @xmath107 which is analogous to the dalembert solution of the wave equation .",
    "it represents a generic wave ( not necessarily periodic ) travelling downstream with velocity @xmath18 and depending only on the combination @xmath108 .  a growing or decaying travelling wave is not strictly described by this",
    "_ ansatz _ unless @xmath109 ( since a spatially changing amplitude implies a dependence on @xmath110 and not purely on @xmath111 but we expect that it describes the asymptotic behavior of such a wave when the amplitude saturates .  substituting this into the reaction - diffusion - advection equation ( [ rdaeq ] )  gives a one - dimensional ode : @xmath112 with a change of variable @xmath113 @xmath114  we obtain @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath19 represents the effective strength of the diffusion term for a given wave .",
    "if ( [ travelodescaled ] ) has a periodic solution @xmath117 , then the period @xmath118 in terms of @xmath119 is related to the frequency and wave number of the corresponding travelling wave by@xmath120 where we have made explicit the dependence of @xmath118 on @xmath19 .",
    "some limiting cases are instructive and help to furnish a physical interpretation of the particular combination of parameters @xmath19 .",
    "first , note that the kinematic limit @xmath121 can be approached in several ways , either by decreasing @xmath7 or by increasing @xmath122  the limits @xmath123 ( infinite phase speed ) both correspond to oscillations which are uniform in space .",
    "diffusion can have no effect on a system with no spatial gradients , and so it is understandable that the effective diffusion vanishes in this limit .  on the other hand ,  as @xmath18 approaches @xmath8 from either direction",
    "@xmath19 diverges .",
    "this divergence can be understood qualitatively if one considers the diffusionless limit as a zeroth order  approximation to the phase dynamics .  in this limit",
    ", @xmath124 is a constant and the physical wavelength @xmath125 shrinks to zero as @xmath126 .",
    "if a nonzero diffusion is then turned on , then it is natural to expect that it creates more mixing between crests and troughs when the waves are close together than when they are far apart .  as the wavelength shrinks , the effect of diffusion on the waveform increases .",
    "the special case @xmath109 describes stationary waves , which result from a steady - state boundary condition .",
    "the combination of parameters controlling the behavior of stationary waves is the same combination identified in the linearized analyisis , namely @xmath127  in the case of complex eigenvalues , the condition for the existence of undamped periodic stationary waves is the one already derived using the linearized analysis :  @xmath128  above this threshold all solutions spiral into the fixed point .",
    "however , since the nature of solutions to ( [ travelodescaled ] ) is governed only by @xmath19 , one can obtain a more general threshold for undamped periodic _ travelling _ waves with phase velocity @xmath129  such waves are undamped only if @xmath130 for given values of @xmath7 and of the kinetic control parameters that determine @xmath35 and @xmath58 ,  there is an interval of phase velocities , surrounding the flow velocity ,  within which travelling waves do not propagate .",
    "for the case of an unstable node or @xmath39 , on the other hand , the threshold ( [ dcthreshold ] ) diverges and so it appears that there is no such excluded band of phase velocities .",
    "we will further examine this issue below .",
    "the equation ( [ travelodescaled ] )  is useful for several reasons .",
    "first ,  it shows that the essential features of travelling and stationary waves ( the amplitude and the waveform ) depend on a single combination of transport parameters , @xmath19 , and therefore a family of different waves are described by a single universal function .",
    "second , as a general rule , ode s can be solved with less computational effort than pde s , and ( [ travelodescaled ] )  allows one to derive wave solutions without solving the full pde ( [ rdaeq ] ) .",
    "solution methods are described in appendix b.  ( [ travelodescaled ] ) is solved on a finite interval with boundary conditions , and the solution will in general include transients near the boundaries .  in the case",
    "@xmath109 , these may represent actual transients of the stationary wave solution near the physical boundaries of the reactor .",
    "on the other hand , if we wish to describe the asymptotic behavior of travelling wave solutions with @xmath131 the transients should be ignored .",
    "some examples of numerical solutions for the fn system are shown in figures [ qsbvp ] and [ relaxbvp ] .",
    "as expected , increasing @xmath19 has the general effect of increasing the deviations from the kinematic limit .",

    "the phase space orbit remains approximately elliptical .",
    "its period remains approximately constant while its amplitude shrinks uniformly until , at the critical threshold @xmath132 , it vanishes into the fixed point .  in the relaxation oscillation case ,",
    "on the other hand , the limit cycle does not shrink to a point .",
    "instead , as @xmath19 increases , the period @xmath118 increases apparently without bound , and the limit cycle remains elongated in the more unstable eigendirection while narrowing in the transverse direction .",

    "we have attempted to give a general framework for understanding the behavior of flow - distributed waves in one - dimensional open flows of oscillatory media without differential transport , aiming at generic results .  from the point of view of linear stability analysis , we examined some changes that occur generically when an unstable fixed point changes from a focus to a node ,  as typically occurs at sufficient distance from a hopf bifurcation .",
    "we showed that when the fixed point is a node , the first mode to become absolutely unstable is a stationary wave mode . in this case , unlike examples previously noted , a stationary wave can be established by a perturbation of finite duration in time , at least if the system is not far above the absolute instability threshold .",

    "large values of @xmath19 ( where large means significantly larger than @xmath200 , the threshold of absolute instability in the @xmath109 case ) often presented computational challenges because the solutions become more sensitive to the right boundary condition , and large intervals were needed in order for an attractor to appear .",
