    "are widely recognized to be well predicted by using fractional differential operators @xcite . during the past decades",
    ", the subject of fractional calculus , and its potential applications , have gained an increase of importance , mainly because it has become a powerful tool with more accurate and successful results in modeling several complex phenomena in numerous seemingly diverse and widespread fields of science and engineering @xcite .",
    "there has been a significant development in nonlocal problems for ( fractional ) differential equations or inclusions ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "nonlinear fractional differential equations have , in recent years , been object of an increasing interest because of their wide applicability in nonlinear oscillations of earthquakes , many physical phenomena such as seepage flow in porous media , and in fluid dynamic traffic model @xcite . on the other hand , there could be no manufacturing , no vehicles , no computers , and no regulated environment , without control systems .",
    "control systems are most often based on the principle of feedback , whereby the signal to be controlled is compared to a desired reference signal and the discrepancy used to compute corrective control actions @xcite . over the last years ,",
    "one of the fields of science that has been well established is the fractional calculus of variations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , a generalization of this area , namely the fractional optimal control , is a topic of research by many authors @xcite .",
    "the fractional optimal control of a distributed system is an optimal control problem for which the system dynamics is defined with partial fractional differential equations @xcite .",
    "the calculus of variations with constraints being sets of solutions of control systems , allow us to justify , while performing numerical calculations , the passage from a nonconvex optimal control problem to the convexified optimal control problem .",
    "we then approximate the latter problem by a sequence of smooth and convex optimal control problems , for which the optimality conditions are known and methods of their numerical resolution are well developed .",
    "sobolev type semilinear equations serve as an abstract formulation of partial differential equations , which arise in various applications such as in the flow of fluid through fissured rocks , thermodynamics , and shear in second order fluids .",
    "further , the fractional differential equations of sobolev type appear in the theory of control of dynamical systems , when the controlled system and/or the controller is described by a fractional differential equation of sobolev type .",
    "furthermore , the mathematical modeling and simulations of systems and processes are based on the description of their properties in terms of fractional differential equations of sobolev type .",
    "these new models are more adequate than previously used integer order models , so fractional order differential equations of sobolev type have been investigated by many researchers : see , for example , feckan , wang and zhou @xcite and li , liang and xu @xcite . in our previous works @xcite ,",
    "we have introduced the notion of nonlocal control condition and presented a new kind of sobolev type condition that appears in terms of two linear operators .",
    "kamocki @xcite studied the existence of optimal solutions to fractional optimal control problems .",
    "liu et al .",
    "@xcite established the relaxation for nonconvex optimal control problems described by fractional differential equations .",
    "motivated by the above facts and results , we introduce here a new kind of sobolev type condition and another form of a nonlocal control condition for nonlinear fractional multiple control systems .",
    "the new sobolev condition is given in terms of two linear operators and requires formulating two other characteristic solution operators and their properties , such as boundedness and compactness .",
    "further , we consider an optimal control problem @xmath0 of multi - integral functionals , with integrands that are not convex in the controls .",
    "we establish an interrelation between the solutions of problem @xmath0 and the relaxation problem @xmath1 . under certain assumptions",
    ", it is proved that @xmath1 has a solution and that for any solution of @xmath1 there is a minimizing sequence for @xmath0 converging , in the appropriate topologies , to the solution of @xmath1 .",
    "the convergence takes place simultaneously with respect to the trajectory , the control and the functional .",
