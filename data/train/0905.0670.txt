    "the regularity of the cylinder is given by the fact that @xmath303 .",
    "a _ cone _ is a ruled surface that can be parameterized by @xmath304 , where @xmath200 is a regular curve .",
    "the vertex of the cone is the origin and the surface is regular wherever @xmath305 .      let @xmath9 be a spacelike cylinder generated by a curve @xmath200 and a fixed direction @xmath21 . as the surface is spacelike , @xmath21 is a spacelike vector , which it will be assumed @xmath306 .",
    "we can suppose that @xmath200 is contained in a plane @xmath307 being @xmath21 orthogonal to @xmath307 .",
    "in particular , @xmath307 is a timelike plane .",
    "the unit normal vector is @xmath308 .    by contradiction",
    ", we assume that @xmath200 is not a straight - line , that is , @xmath309 at some interval .",
    "we consider @xmath281 the frenet frame of @xmath200 .",
    "as @xmath200 is a planar curve , @xmath310 and so , @xmath311 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the unit ( timelike ) vector such that the function @xmath312 is constant , that is , @xmath313 is constant . by differentiation with respect to @xmath208 , using the frenet equations and since @xmath200 is a planar curve , we obtain @xmath314 for any @xmath208 .",
    "a new differentiation gives @xmath315 for any @xmath208 .",
    "as @xmath309 , we have @xmath242 , for any @xmath208 .",
    "however , @xmath217 and @xmath14 are both timelike vectors and thus , the product @xmath313 can never vanish : contradiction .",
    "consequently , @xmath316 for any @xmath208 , that is , @xmath200 is a straight - line and then @xmath9 is a ( spacelike ) plane .",
    "we point out that this result is more restrictive than the corresponding in euclidean space @xmath0 . in @xmath0 ,",
    "any cylinder is a constant angle : it is suffices to take @xmath14 as the vector that defines the rulings of the cylinder .",
    "the difference in lorentzian ambient is that our surfaces are spacelike and the vector @xmath14 is timelike , which imposes extra conditions .    for the next result for cones , we need recall that a ( spacelike ) circle in minkowski space is a planar curve with constant curvature @xcite .",
    "we also point that the plane @xmath307 containing the circle can be of any causal character .",
    "indeed , after a rigid motion of @xmath5 , a spacelike circle can be viewed as follows : a euclidean circle in a horizontal plane ( if @xmath307 is spacelike ) , a hyperbola in a vertical plane ( if @xmath307 is timelike ) and a parabola in a @xmath317-inclined plane ( if @xmath307 is lightlike ) .    [ t - cone ] let @xmath9 be a ( spacelike ) cone .",
    "then @xmath9 is a constant angle surface if and only if the generating curve is a circle in a spacelike plane or it is a straight - line ( and @xmath9 is a plane ) .",
    "let @xmath9 be a cone , which can assume that its vertex is the origin of @xmath318 .",
    "let @xmath304 be a parametrization of @xmath9 , where @xmath319 and @xmath320 , @xmath321 .",
    "as @xmath322 is spacelike , @xmath323 . on the other hand , @xmath324 must be spacelike , this means that @xmath325 .",
    "we can change @xmath326 by a proportional vector and to assume that @xmath200 lies in the unit minkowski sphere of @xmath5 , that is , in the de sitter space @xmath327 .",
    "thus , @xmath328 for any @xmath321 . without loss of generality , we suppose that @xmath227 is parameterized by the arc - length .",
    "then @xmath326 and @xmath210 are orthogonal to @xmath211 .",
    "the unit normal vector field @xmath12 on @xmath9 is collinear to @xmath329 .",
    "denoting by @xmath218 , we have @xmath330 . in particular",
    ", @xmath331 assume that @xmath9 is a constant angle surface and let @xmath14 be the unit timelike vector such that @xmath312 is constant . by differentiation with respect to @xmath208 , we have @xmath332 for any @xmath208 . substituting in the value of @xmath210 obtained in , we get @xmath333 we discuss the two possibilities :    1 .   if @xmath334 at some point , then @xmath335 for any @xmath208 .",
    "this means that @xmath326 lies in a plane orthogonal to @xmath14 and so , this plane must be spacelike .",
    "thus the acceleration @xmath210 is a spacelike vector .",
    "then we can take the frenet frame of @xmath200 , namely @xmath281 , where @xmath336 is a timelike vector",
    ". moreover , @xmath337 . if @xmath316 for any @xmath208 , then @xmath200 is a straight - line and the surface is a plane . on the contrary , since @xmath338 , by taking the derivative , one obtains @xmath339 . on the other hand , because @xmath200 is a planar curve ( @xmath240 ) , the derivative of the function @xmath340 vanishes .",
    "this means that @xmath341 is constant and",
    "so , @xmath342 is constant .",
    "2 .   assume @xmath343 for any @xmath208 .",
    "as @xmath326 and @xmath211 are orthogonal spacelike vectors , then @xmath210 is a spacelike vector .",
    "again , we consider the frenet frame @xmath281 where @xmath287 is a timelike vector .",
    "the above equation writes now as @xmath344 .",
    "if @xmath316 for any @xmath208 , then @xmath200 is a straight - line again .",
    "suppose now @xmath345 .",
    "similar to the previous case , because @xmath346 , it follows @xmath338 and @xmath339 .",
    "in particular , @xmath347 and then , the derivative of @xmath348 implies @xmath240 , that is , @xmath200 is a planar curve .",
    "finally , the derivative of @xmath341 is zero , namely @xmath341 is constant , and then , @xmath342 is constant too ."
