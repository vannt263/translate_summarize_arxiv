    "lagrange was the first to observe that there is an exact solution of the three body problem in which the bodies lie at the vertices of an equilateral triangle .",
    "this has a direct application to the solar system .",
    "the trojan asteroids librate about the so - called @xmath2 and @xmath3 lagrange points , and lie roughly @xmath4 ahead and behind the mean longitude of the planet .",
    "( e.g. , danby 1988 ) .",
    "jupiter provides the best known and longest studied case .",
    "the population of the jovian trojans is substantial .",
    "for example , the number of objects with radii in excess of 1 km may exceed @xmath5 in total ( jewitt , trujillo & luu 2000 ) .",
    "by contrast , very few trojans of the other planets are known .",
    "only 3 mars trojans ( namely ( 5261 ) eureka , 1998 vf@xmath6 and 1999 uj@xmath7 ) have been securely identified ( see e.g. , tabachnik & evans 1999 ; rivkin et al .",
    "recent wide - field surveys of the outer solar system ( chiang et al .",
    "2003 ; sheppard & trujillo 2005 ) have also discovered 2 neptunian trojans ( namely 2001 qr@xmath8 and 2004 up@xmath9 ) .",
    "there have been surveys for trojans of saturn , uranus , and the earth , but they have not yielded any positive detections ( e.g. , whiteley & tholen 1998 ; sheppard & trujillo 2005 ) . nonetheless , numerical simulations by a number of authors ( e.g. , holman & wisdom 1987 ; evans & tabachnik 2000 ) suggest that trojans could exist in long - lived and stable orbits in the vicinity of these planets .    a number of possible formation scenarios for the jovian trojan asteroids have been proposed .",
    "one suggestion is that the trojans are planetesimals formed near , and captured by , the growing jupiter possibly with the aid of a dissipative mechanism like gas drag or collisions ( e.g. , marzari & scholl 1998 ; fleming & hamilton 2000 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the trojans were captured into co - orbital motion with jupiter in the early solar system , during the time of migration of the giant planets ( morbidelli et al .",
    "the origin of the trojan asteroids of mars and neptune may however be different to the jovian case .",
    "chiang et al . ( 2003 ) suggest that debris from planetesimal collisions occurring after neptune reached its current location may have accreted naturally in the @xmath10 resonance to provide its trojan clouds .    in this _",
    ", we consider the possibility that some of the trojans may originate from capture of centaurs .",
    "this idea seems to have been first suggested by rabe ( 1970 ) , but hard evidence from numerical simulations has so far been lacking .",
    "the mechanism of capture is often invoked to explain the irregular outer satellites of jupiter , uranus and neptune ( e.g. , sheppard & jewitt 2003 ; sheppard et al .",

    "this _ letter _ has demonstrated a new possibility for the origin of some of the trojans of the giant planets . they may be centaurs , temporarily captured into the @xmath10 resonances .",
    "we have used data from 3 myr simulations of representatives of the centaur population to provide specific examples of this delivery mechanism . in particular",
    ", saturn seems to be most efficient at making such temporary captures from the centaur region .",
    "saturn captures the bulk of the @xmath0 centaurs every myr that pass through a lengthy temporary trojan phase ( a capture for 800 or more orbital periods of the parent object ) .",
    "since we expect @xmath0 such lengthy captures , it is quite likely that the number of shorter captures is significantly higher , and hence that there may well be such temporary visitors residing in these regions at the present time .",
    "the objects captured within these simulations display a roughly equal likelihood of capture into the leading and trailing trojan clouds , a quantitative difference to the observed long - lived population of jovian trojans .",
    "possible evidence of such interlopers within the trojan clouds might be garnered from observations of colours or from photometric activity .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to see whether any jovian trojans display cometary out - gassing , since recently captured centaurs may still contain volatiles , whilst any trojans captured since the birth of the solar system are unlikely to display such activity .",
    "similarly , if any jovian trojans are found be of significantly different colour to other objects in the cloud , this may hint at a different delivery mechanism , and may help the identification of such temporary visitors . at saturn , since it is unlikely that many trojans would survive at the @xmath2 and @xmath3 points on timescales approaching the age of the solar system , it is likely that any trojans discovered in the future represent recent , temporary captures , rather than a native population .",
    "morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggested that the jovian trojan population may have been captured into co - orbital motion with jupiter during the latter part of its proposed migration .",
    "the fact that temporary captures can be seen in our dataset with such frequency seems to add weight to this mechanism for the formation of the trojan clouds , by illustrating that temporary captures are not uncommon even at the current day .",
    "given the fact of jupiter s migration , it is quite feasible that objects originally captured on temporary orbits could be converted to ones which could reside in the trojan region for the age of the solar system ."
