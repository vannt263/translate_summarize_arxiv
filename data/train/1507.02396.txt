    "galaxies form in these dark matter haloes through the binding of baryons and the cooling of gas @xcite .",
    "since galaxies evolve in their host haloes , the distribution and evolution of galaxies are tightly related to their host dark matter haloes @xcite . in the context of hierarchical structure formation models",
    ", massive dark matter haloes can contain many galaxies with a wide range in mass .",
    "furthermore , the population of member galaxies depends on the properties of their host dark matter halo , because the potential well of the dark matter halo affects the properties of galaxies within it .",
    "a popular method for measuring the distribution of galaxies is the two - point correlation function , which describes the excess probability of a galaxy pair over a random distribution on specific scales @xcite .",
    "recently , wide and deep surveys have provided opportunities to study the dependence of the clustering of galaxies on their various intrinsic properties such as color , luminosity , stellar mass and population @xcite . as a result",
    ", it is known that redder , brighter or more massive galaxies are more strongly clustered than those having opposite properties .    for high redshift galaxies ,",
    "one of the most efficient selection methods is to use their observed color .",
    "thus , many previous studies have applied various color cuts to select high redshift galaxies such as extremely red objects @xcite , @xmath12 galaxies @xcite and distant red galaxies @xcite .",
    "their clustering properties also show similar trends to those of low redshift galaxies .",
    "although color selection is efficient in isolating galaxies in a specific redshift range , a simple color cut often extracts a mix of galaxies with different properties and redshift . hence to correctly trace galaxy clustering it is necessary to measure it from a sample containing galaxies with well defined intrinsic properties and a narrower range in redshift",
    ".    the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) framework makes it possible to interpret the galaxy clustering in relation to their host dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "the hod quantifies the mean number of central or satellite galaxies in a given halo mass @xcite .",
    "based on the halo model analysis with multiwavelength datasets , many authors have reported that massive or luminous galaxies are found in more massive haloes @xcite .",
    "however , the hod framework fits the number density of galaxies and their clustering simultaneously so we require a large number of galaxies to sufficiently constrain the parameters of both . also , to avoid the effects of cosmic variance",
    ", these galaxies need to be mapped over a large area of sky .",
    "the lack of large , sensitive near - ir detectors has prevented identification of a large number of galaxies at @xmath13 , where the bulk of stellar emission is observed in a near - ir regime .",
    "so far , previous work on stellar mass limited galaxies at high redshifts has been based on survey data with areas from a few hundreds arcmin@xmath3 to @xmath141.7 deg@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this small surveyed area makes it difficult to measure reliable clustering strengths on larger scales ( a few tens @xmath4mpc ) , where the distribution of dark matter haloes is imprinted , since these surveys have covered at most @xmath15 50 @xmath4mpc at @xmath2 on a side .",
    "therefore it is important to perform this analysis with homogeneous galaxy samples drawn from a wide - area near - ir survey .    in terms of galaxy evolution ,",
    "different mechanisms play key roles at different epochs .",
    "@xcite proposed that mass quenching is important for all galaxies , but environment quenching dominates at low redshift and at lower masses .",
    "also , there have been many results about the stellar mass function of passive galaxies from wide field optical  near - ir datasets , showing relatively mild evolution of the most massive galaxies but a dramatic change for low mass ones @xcite , which is consistent with the model in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the evolution of the luminosity function of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) follows a passive evolution model at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the fraction of early type galaxies increases from 30% at @xmath17 to 80% at @xmath18 in the densest regions , but from 30% to only 50% in low density regions .",
    "these results suggest that the dependence of galaxy properties on their host haloes at @xmath2 is different from that in the local universe .",
    "furthermore , the relation between galaxy properties and their environment at @xmath2 is still controversial . @xcite and @xcite found a reversed relation between star formation rate ( sfr ) and environment at @xmath2 , meaning a higher sfr",
    "was observed in the highest density regions .",

    "@xcite argued that the central galaxies in low mass haloes are likely to be star - forming galaxies at @xmath2 , and their evolution contributes to the observed change in the red sequence .",

    "however , the effect of agn feedback is still controversial and there is a debate as to whether this is positive or negative on short timescales ( @xmath107  myr )",
    ". therefore we do not consider this effect in this work .",
    "furthermore , @xcite pointed out that any halo model that does not take into account the assembly bias leads to a systematic error on the fitted result .",
    "although this effect is significant for red populations , it is much reduced when considering all galaxies .    using the basic components mentioned above , we follow the scheme of @xcite .",
    "briefly , we model power spectra contributed by galaxies in the same halo ( 1-halo term ) and in different haloes ( 2-halo term ) .",
    "the 1-halo term is distinguished into central - satellite and satellite - satellite pairs again . in order to consider the underlying dark matter ,",
    "the matter power spectrum is generated by the ` camb ' software package @xcite including the formulae of @xcite to model nonlinear growth .",
    "then the modeled power spectrum is transformed to the real - space correlation function using the limber equation @xcite to project the modeled real - space correlation function to angular space .",
    "the redshift distribution of each sub - sample is generated not by the best fit photometric redshift , but by the possible redshift distribution of each galaxy .",
    "we adopt 90% redshift ranges from the _ le phare _ software for each galaxy , then assume the gaussian distribution above and below the redshift separately .",
    "this distribution of each galaxy is stacked to produce the redshift distribution .",
    "finally , the modeled angular correlation function is fitted to the observed correlation function with the covariance matrix derived in   [ atcf ] to find the best fit parameters .",
    "we fit the modeled correlation function to the observed one over the angular range @xmath108 , where the influence of the integral constraint is minimized .",
    "additionally , the effective halo mass ( @xmath109 ) , the effective bias ( @xmath110 ) and the fraction of central galaxies ( @xmath111 ) are derived from the best fit parameters with @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the number density of galaxies , which is fixed to the observed value in this work .",
    "we perform the halo modeling for only galaxies selected above a stellar mass threshold , since this model is appropriate for mass or luminosity limited samples . for the galaxies in stellar mass bins ,",
    "the difference of hods between two mass thresholds is calculated ( see   [ mbin ] ) .",
    "in this section , we describe the results from fitting the halo model to galaxies split by different stellar mass thresholds of @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 (   [ mth ] ) .",
    "then the hods for galaxies in different stellar mass bins ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) are compared in   [ mbin ] .",
    "finally based on these hods , the ratio between stellar mass and halo mass is discussed in   [ mratio ]      in order to investigate the dependence of the hod parameters on stellar mass , we split the selected galaxies at stellar mass thresholds of @xmath122 , @xmath117 and @xmath123 . in total , 66,864 , 29,250 and 4,564",
    "galaxies are selected for each stellar mass threshold , respectively .",
    "the upper panels of figure  [ figmth ] show the measured angular two - point correlation function for each sub - sample ( points with error bars ) .",
    "the relatively large error for @xmath124 comes from the significantly smaller number of galaxies .",
    "the solid line is the best fit halo model .",
    "as seen in figure  [ figmth ] , the halo model reproduces the observed angular correlation function well .",
    "it also shows a relatively good fit even beyond the fitted range ( @xmath125 ) and a more pronounced break between the 1- and 2-halo components as the balance of central to satellite galaxies changes with stellar mass .",
    "the best fit parameters and derived quantities are listed in table  [ tparam ] .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ figmth ] display the best fit hods for each sub - sample ( solid line ) .",
    "the dotted and the dashed lines are hods for central galaxies and satellites , respectively .",
    "it is clear that hods for lower stellar mass galaxies extend down to a lower halo mass regime .",
    "this is well described by the best fit parameters of two halo mass thresholds ( @xmath101 and @xmath104 ) , which decrease for low mass galaxies .",
    "in addition , the hod of more massive central galaxies shows a gentler transition shape compared to less massive central galaxies as already reported by @xcite .",
    "the best fit parameter @xmath102 describing the transition shape is 0.5 for @xmath1 and 0.6 for @xmath126 . in order to check the effect of the galaxy number density to the best fit parameters ,",
    "we perform the fit with four free parameters ( @xmath102 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath103 ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath115 does not directly constrain @xmath103 , but is calculated by the best fit parameters for matching the clustering only .",
    "although , the parameters show different values from 3 parameter fits , the trend is exactly same .",
    "these results are presented in appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "axis.[figpar ] ]    figure  [ figpar ] shows derived quantities as a function of stellar mass thresholds with filled circles .",
    "the top and middle panels show the effective halo mass and the bias for each sub - sample .",
    "clearly massive galaxies tend to reside in massive haloes with high bias values , consistent with previous work . from the bottom panel of figure  [ figpar ]",
    ", we can see that massive galaxies also tend to be the central galaxy in a massive halo .",
    "recently , many researchers have measured the clustering of galaxies split by stellar mass .",
    "for instance , @xcite measured the clustering of galaxies from the palomar observatory wide - field infrared survey ( conselice et al .",
    "their results show a halo mass of @xmath127 and a bias of 1.9 for @xmath128 galaxies at @xmath57 , which is lower than ours ( cross in figure  [ figpar ] ) .",
    "however , their analysis was done over a 1.5 deg@xmath3 area , which is @xmath1295 times smaller than ours .",
    "in addition , they measured halo masses based on the `` one galaxy per halo '' assumption with a correction for the halo occupation .",
    "as mentioned above , hod analysis may be affected by cosmic variance if the survey area is too small and the quality of the photometric redshifts used is poor . with these issues in mind",
    "we quote two more results , one from a much wider area and another one based on the spectroscopic information .",
    "first , @xcite performed the halo modeling to reproduce the clustering of galaxies categorized by luminosity and type from the full cfhtls  wide survey area ( @xmath130 deg@xmath3 ) .",
    "of our sub - samples , galaxies with @xmath131 and @xmath118 have similar number densities to their sub - samples containing all galaxies at @xmath132 and @xmath133 at @xmath134 .",
    "their estimates were @xmath109 of @xmath135 and @xmath136 , bias of @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and the satellite fraction ( @xmath139 ) of @xmath140 and @xmath141 for @xmath132 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "overall , these results are in good agreement with our estimates , although the halo mass for the brightest luminosity bin is about 0.15 dex higher than ours ( open squares in figure  [ figpar ] ) .",
    "second , @xcite used galaxies with spectroscopic information from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite to measure a projected correlation function of galaxies at @xmath143 at different stellar masses , sfrs and ssfrs . they estimated bias and mean halo mass as ( @xmath144 , @xmath135 ) and ( @xmath145 , @xmath146 ) for all galaxies at @xmath147 with @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively ( open triangles in figure  [ figpar ] ) . although the stellar mass thresholds are slightly different from our samples , all estimates are in good agreement with our values .",
    "it is interesting to note that our estimates are consistent with cfhtls ( wide - area survey ) and deep2 ( a wide spectroscopic survey ) , while small area surveys give somewhat different results .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the importance of surveyed area for the reliable measurement of galaxy clustering on large scales in overcoming cosmic variance studying extremely red objects .",
    "the scatter of clustering on large scales is @xmath1530% and @xmath1520% in areas of 0.26 deg@xmath3 and 0.6 deg@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the halo model with hods may be a more reliable scheme to measure the masses of host haloes for all , central and satellite galaxies , since this takes into account a more realistic contribution of central and satellite galaxies . based on hods discussed in this section",
    ", we can extend our analysis for galaxies split into stellar mass bins , which is an aspect that has not been fully explored in the literature .",
    "if we are able to find the hods of galaxies in various stellar mass bins , we can understand the relation between galaxies and their host haloes .",
    "however it is difficult to model the clustering of galaxies in stellar mass bins , since a different hod shape should be assumed that is not well understood yet . in this section",
    ", we use the hods discussed in   [ mth ] to obtain the hods of galaxies in different stellar mass bins .",
    "@xcite took the difference of hods of luminosity threshold samples , in order to obtain the hods of luminosity binned samples .",
    "we adopt this method to obtain the hods of galaxies in different stellar mass bins .",
    "for instance , we obtain a hod of galaxies at @xmath119 by subtracting the hod of @xmath131 galaxies from the hod of @xmath1 galaxies .",
    "the bottom panels of figure  [ figmbin ] show the hods for @xmath119 ( left ) and @xmath120 ( middle ) galaxies , respectively , estimated in this way . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the hod for @xmath121 galaxies in the right panel .",
    "the upper panels display the observed angular correlation functions ( points ) for each stellar mass binned sample .",
    "the solid lines in the top - left and top - middle panels are not the best fit results , but the modeled clustering based on the stellar mass binned hods .",
    "the top - right panel is identical to that in figure  [ figmth ] .",
    "the modeled correlation functions show a good agreement with the observed ones , except at a very small scales ( @xmath150 ) where the modeled correlation functions are slightly underestimated in comparison to the observed ones .",
    "returning to the hods , we note that the hod for central galaxies is similar to a log  normal distribution , which indicates that there is a crude correlation between the host halo mass and the stellar mass of the central galaxies @xcite .",
    "the width of the distribution reflects the amount of the scatter in this relation @xcite , and we find that the central hod for more massive galaxies covers a wider halo mass range at a given value of @xmath151 than that for less massive ones with the peak position shifted toward the high halo mass regime . as shown in the previous section , more massive galaxies show a gentler central hod shape than less massive ones , which means a larger scatter between the stellar mass of central galaxies and the host halo mass",
    ". therefore the broader shape of the hod of massive galaxies reflects this effect .",
    "this can be caused by the stellar mass growth being stopped by any quenching mechanism , whilst the haloes keep growing .",
    "for instance , @xcite pointed out that the inclusion of agn feedback leads to a change in slope and a larger scatter of the relation between @xmath22-band luminosities of central galaxies and their host halo masses , since the feedback presents gas cooling .",
    "in addition , @xcite compared the hods predicted by different semi - analytic models and show that the central hods of more massive galaxies are more affected by this feedback in all simulations .",
    "the idea is that above a certain luminosity or mass , galaxies do not grow to have a very large stellar mass due to the negative feedback by agn , resulting in cases where very massive haloes possess central galaxies with reduced ( but still massive ) stellar masses .",
    "consequently , the hod of massive galaxies becomes extended toward a large halo mass .",
    "the horizontal bars indicate the size of stellar mass bins.[figparbin ] ]    the upper panel of figure  [ figparbin ] shows the effective mass of dark matter haloes hosting galaxies in each stellar mass bin calculated from the hods . for the most massive bin",
    ", we plot the stellar mass threshold sample of @xmath126 .",
    "the mass of dark matter haloes hosting central galaxies ( filled circles ) increases as the stellar mass increases with close to a linear slope .",
    "that for satellites ( open circles ) also shows a similar trend , but not as dramatic as it is for central galaxies .",
    "the reason for this difference in satellite galaxies is that a massive halo contains a large number of satellites in addition to a massive central galaxy .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ figparbin ] displays the fraction of central galaxies in each stellar mass bin .",
    "this indicates that the massive galaxies are more likely to be central galaxies as the halo mass increases .",
    "since galaxies evolve in dark matter haloes , the properties of galaxies depend on their host dark matter haloes . in this context ,",
    "the relation between stellar mass ( @xmath0 ) and halo mass ( @xmath9 ) is a good testbed to constrain the evolution of galaxies .",
    "in addition , the ratio between the stellar mass of central galaxies and the halo mass is sensitive to the conversion efficiency from baryons to stellar mass in the central galaxy @xcite . in previous work ,",
    "the @xmath0@xmath9 ( or @xmath5@xmath9 ) relation was derived using several different methods such as hod , conditional luminosity function and sub - halo abundance matching @xcite .",
    "however , one of the advantages of the hod framework is that the clustering and the number density of galaxies are fitted simultaneously without any assumption about the scatter between @xmath0 and @xmath9 being a fixed value . here",
    ", we derive the relation based on the best fit hods directly , unlike previous hod work , fitting a functional form to best fit hod parameters .",
    "we use the hods for stellar mass binned samples discussed in the previous section to calculate the stellar mass to halo mass ratio ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "since the hod is the mean number of galaxies at a given halo mass , the summation of hods multiplied by mean stellar masses for a given stellar mass bin represents the stellar mass at a given halo mass .",
    "therefore , the stellar mass at a given halo mass can be calculated by @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the central or satellite hod for the @xmath154th stellar mass binned sample and @xmath155 is the mean stellar mass of galaxies in the @xmath154th stellar mass bin . in this work , there are three stellar mass bins , each corresponding to @xmath156 , @xmath120 and @xmath126 .",
    "using this stellar mass , we calculate the stellar mass to halo mass ratio .",
    "the upper panel in figure  [ figmsmh ] shows the stellar mass to halo mass ratio for the central galaxy .",
    "the red solid line is the result based on equation ( 8) .",
    "the peak of the ratio is located at @xmath157 with a ratio of 0.024 . below and above this halo mass ,",
    "the ratio drops rapidly .",
    "this means that the conversion from baryons to stellar mass in the central galaxy is the most efficient in @xmath158 dark matter haloes as traced at @xmath2 . for the comparison",
    ", we also display the ratio at @xmath40 ( royal blue line ) from @xcite .",
    "we have to note that the ratio may be underestimated for low mass haloes in this work , since the stellar mass limit is @xmath80 , and less massive galaxies are missed .",
    "therefore the actual slope of the ratio in the low halo mass regime may be flatter than our measurement .    .",
    "the result of this work is represented by a thick red line . for the comparison",
    ", we also plot previous results at @xmath2 from @xcite ( green dotted line ) , @xcite ( black points ) , @xcite ( blue short dashed line ) and @xcite ( cyan points ) .",
    "the ratio shows a peak at @xmath159 , which is consistent with previous results .",
    "the orange line is the ratio calculated by the empirical function in @xcite for our result .",
    "the lower panel displays the ratio for central ( red ) and satellite ( blue ) galaxies .",
    "the black line is the combination of both central and satellite galaxies .",
    "the orange and cyan lines are results with varying hod parameters randomly within the uncertainty range for central and satellite galaxies , respectively .",
    "solid and dashed lines are from @xcite for @xmath1600 and 2.5 respectively .",
    "satellites mainly contribute to the total stellar mass in group or cluster scale haloes .",
    "[ figmsmh],width=204 ]    here , we also compare our result with other previous works .",
    "@xcite also performed the halo modeling for stellar mass limited samples from the newfirm medium band survey @xcite . after fitting the empirical function in @xcite to the best fit hod parameters",
    ", they obtained the ratio at @xmath161 ( cyan points in figure  [ figmsmh ] ) .",
    "their result shows a peak at a higher halo mass , and a flatter ( steeper ) shape in a high ( low ) halo mass regime than ours , although the relation is poorly constrained at high and low halo masses .",
    "if we also fit the same function to our best fit parameters , this also shows a steeper slope in the low halo mass regime , but the discrepancy is not so significant in the high mass regime ( orange line ) . on the one hand",
    ", this means that the functional form may underestimate the ratio for less massive haloes , since this does not fully take into account hods for stellar mass binned samples . on the other hand , for the high halo mass regime , the flatter trend may be caused by the different parameter set for hods as @xcite fixed the transition shape of central hods with @xmath162 .",
    "in fact , the relation between derived halo mass parameters for central galaxies ( @xmath101 in equation ( 3 ) ) and stellar masses in @xcite is flatter than ours .",
    "if we make the relation for our fitted parameters flatter arbitrarily , the ratio becomes much flatter in the high halo mass regime .",
    "@xcite also estimated the ratio as 0.032@xmath1630.022 and 0.026@xmath1630.017 for @xmath164 and @xmath165 at @xmath57 , respectively ( black points ) .",
    "although these are in agreement within the uncertainty range , their halo masses are smaller compared to ours as mentioned above .",
    "therefore it is possible that their points move toward a lower ratio and a higher halo mass regime , and become consistent with ours .",
    "additionally , @xcite obtained the same quantity using the abundance matching technique .",
    "we plot their result for the central galaxy including full uncertainties at @xmath40 in the upper panel of figure  [ figmsmh ] ( green points and line ) .",
    "our result agrees with theirs within the uncertainty .",
    "however , our result may be slightly steeper in both the high and low halo mass regimes than the @xcite result .",
    "we find a similar discrepancy from @xcite as well ( royal blue ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the ratio in the low halo mass regime is underestimated due to the stellar mass limit in this work . however , in the high halo mass regime , that is not the case and other factors may account for this discrepancy .",
    "first , @xcite and @xcite included the scatter in the @xmath0-@xmath9 relation with a fixed value . whereas , our hod takes into account such a scatter as shown in figure  [ figmth ] .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a larger scatter in the relation makes the relation steeper .",
    "second , the stellar mass uncertainty on individual galaxies can also affect the result , since the number of low mass galaxies having overestimated stellar masses is larger than that of high mass galaxies with underestimated stellar masses .",
    "if this scatter is included , the relation also becomes steeper @xcite .",
    "in addition to the central galaxy , satellites also contribute to the total baryons in dark matter haloes . @xcite and @xcite pointed out that satellites account for the majority of the total stellar mass in more massive dark matter haloes . as we discussed in the previous section ,",
    "satellite galaxies with @xmath1 tend to live in massive haloes .",
    "the bottom panel in figure  [ figmsmh ] also shows this trend .",
    "the red line is the ratio for the central galaxy only , which is the same as in the upper panel .",
    "the blue line is for satellites calculated by equation ( 8) with the hods in figure  [ figmbin ] . however , in this case , the value represents the ratio of the total stellar mass in satellites to the total mass of the dark matter halo .",
    "orange and cyan lines are the results for central and satellite galaxies , respectively , which are derived from 100 different hod sets with varying parameters ( @xmath166 and @xmath105 ) with values varied randomly within their measured uncertainty ranges .",
    "in contrast to the central galaxy , the ratio for satellites increases with increasing halo mass .",
    "in addition , the @xmath5 ratio for satellites is comparable with the value for the central galaxy in group environments ( @xmath167 ) and dominant in cluster environments ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the accretion of dark matter toward a massive halo leads to the rapid growth of the halo mass . at the same time",
    ", infalling galaxies become satellites and contribute to the total stellar mass . however , the growth of central galaxies is not so efficient in this regime due to the deep potential well preventing an efficient merger or cold gas accretion onto the central galaxy .",
    "we also note that our data do not include faint , possibly numerous satellite galaxies .",
    "thus , the @xmath5 ratio for satellites may be underestimated and can only be addressed with deeper data .    from the @xmath5 ratio for the central galaxy and satellites , we find that the star formation efficiency for the central galaxy is the most efficient in @xmath158 dark matter haloes at @xmath40 with the @xmath5 ratio peaking at about 0.02 .",
    "moreover , we show that satellites are the dominant contributor to the @xmath5 of high mass haloes ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "when we consider both central and satellite galaxy samples with @xmath1 , we find the star formation efficiency in terms of total halo mass and stars in all galaxies is 1%2% consistently .",
    "however , the cut  off at low halo mass is created by our selection of massive galaxies , so the mass of stars is not fully accounted for in the lowest mass haloes .",
    "we also confirm the evolution of this relation , comparing to the result at different redshift from @xcite ( the bottom panel in figure  [ figmsmh ] ) .",
    "the clustering of galaxies has been shown to depend on star formation rate and color . in this section ,",
    "we split galaxies at @xmath57 based on their star forming activity to investigate how their clustering properties depend on star formation .",
    "additionally , since ssfr is roughly related to the star formation efficiency in a galaxy , we use various ssfr criteria to define each sub - sample .",
    "we start with the comparison of bias values for different populations of galaxies . for this analysis ,",
    "galaxies are split into passive and star - forming . in order to define the ssfr cut for passive galaxies , we check galaxies detected by _ spitzer _ from the irsa catalog .",
    "we cross - match _",
    "sources to our galaxies with @xmath1 and @xmath57 , and find 1871 irac and 213 24@xmath74 m sources . of 24@xmath74 m sources , 15% and 8%",
    "satisfy @xmath84 and @xmath170 , respectively .",
    "this means that the ssfr cut may not be a clean way to classify pure passive galaxies , but we can isolate them efficiently .",
    "thus , although there are two galaxy loci in figure  [ figmssfr ] separated by @xmath171 , we classify passive galaxies with @xmath172 in order to minimize the contamination by dusty galaxies . then , star - forming galaxies are defined by @xmath83 .",
    "we then apply stellar mass cuts with @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 for each population .",
    "however , since the number of star - forming galaxies in the highest mass bin is too small to measure the clustering , we do not include this sub - sample in our analysis .    ,",
    "@xmath173 and @xmath174 ( filled circles ) .",
    "open triangles are from @xcite with @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "open squares are for red galaxies in @xcite with @xmath132 and @xmath177 .",
    "also the open circle shows the result of lrgs at @xmath2 in @xcite .",
    "for the display purpose , open symbols are slightly shifted along the @xmath0 axis.[figpgsf],width=264 ]    for each selected sub - sample , the angular two - point correlation function is measured . since the intrinsic hod shape for each sample is not well understood , we estimate the bias by fitting the angular correlation function of the underlying dark matter instead of finding the best fit hods .",
    "first , we obtain the real space correlation function of dark matter from the linear matter power spectrum at @xmath40 .",
    "then the real space correlation function is transformed into the angular correlation function with the observed redshift distribution , after multiplying it by the bias value . through fitting the transformed angular correlation function to the observed one",
    ", we find the best fit bias values for each sub - sample .",
    "the fitting is performed to the angular range between 0.02@xmath178 and 0.7@xmath178 , where the influence by the integral constraint is minimized and 2-halo component dominates .",
    "filled circles in figure  [ figpgsf ] show the estimated bias for passive ( red ) and star - forming ( blue ) galaxies .",
    "it is clear that passive galaxies are more clustered than star - forming ones , which is consistent with previous results at the similar redshift @xcite . additionally , high mass galaxies show a stronger clustering strength than low mass ones independently of population . on the other hand , some previous results pointed out that passive or red galaxies show similar ( or higher ) clustering strengths with decreasing stellar masses ( deep2 in coil et al .",
    "2008 and ukidss uds in williams et al .",
    "2009 and hartley et al .",
    "open triangles in figure  [ figpgsf ] are for galaxies with @xmath156 and @xmath131 at @xmath179 from @xcite based on the ukidss uds data .",
    "passive galaxies show a similar clustering strength in both bins , which implies that there is no stellar mass dependence .",
    "this was interpreted as the contribution of low mass satellite galaxies in massive haloes , leading to similar clustering strengths independently of the stellar mass .",
    "our results may appear to be different from previous literature results .",
    "however , we also display bias values for red galaxies with @xmath132 and @xmath177 ( red open square ) at @xmath134 from cfhtls in @xcite .",
    "the number densities in each magnitude bin are similar to those for our passive galaxies with @xmath148 and @xmath123 , respectively . although their measurements are lower than ours , brighter red galaxies are more clustered than fainter ones , which is the same trend to our passive galaxies .",
    "possibly lower values are caused by different selection criteria , since absolute magnitude limited samples can include low stellar mass galaxies , but exclude some high mass ones .",
    "in addition , they noted that red galaxies at @xmath180 were contaminated by blue galaxies .",
    "the similar trend was also found in @xcite , which showed early - type galaxies with brighter absolute magnitude are more strongly clustered than fainter early - type galaxies at @xmath181 , based on the cfhtls data .",
    "finally , we also note the bias value from lrgs at @xmath2 from @xcite ( red open circle ) .",
    "the number density of lrgs in their paper is similar to that of our high mass passive galaxies , and the estimated bias is also consistent .",
    "since the area coverage of our data is not wide enough to fully overcome the effect of cosmic variance , it may be hard to conclude whether the clustering strength of passive galaxies at @xmath1821 is correlated with stellar mass in our dataset conclusively .",
    "however , our result shows the consistent trend with the result from the wider survey data , which indicates our dataset is not significantly affected by cosmic variance . based on this conclusion ,",
    "we investigate the clustering property of galaxies with finer ssfr bins below .",
    "as shown in section  [ sedfit ] , the main sequence of star - forming galaxies has a slope of @xmath183 on the ssfr versus stellar mass plane .",
    "however , our main goal is to investigate the clustering strength as a function of star formation activities at @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we simply apply five ssfr bins for star - forming galaxies ( @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 ) .",
    "the width of each bin is determined to include sufficient galaxies for a reasonable clustering measurement .",
    "additionally , passive galaxies are defined as galaxies with @xmath172 , and they are further divided into mass thresholds of @xmath122 , @xmath117 and @xmath123 . column 3 in table  [ tssfr ] lists the number of galaxies in each bin .",
    "we also compare the clustering properties in each ssfr bin with narrower stellar mass bins later .",

    "the top three panels are for passive galaxies with different stellar mass thresholds .",
    "the second and third rows are results for star - forming galaxies in various ssfr bins with @xmath1 .",

    "the discrepancy of biases may come from different selection criteria , since they have used rest - frame magnitude limited samples that may include @xmath192 galaxies which can dilute their measured clustering strength .",
    "since the ssfr value for the main sequence at @xmath40 is @xmath7 in figure  [ figmssfr ] , galaxies just above ( or the upper part of ) the main sequence show the lowest bias , which is consistent with @xcite .",
    "this anti - correlation has been reported at @xmath2 by @xcite and @xcite , and in the local universe by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , we also see a possible reversal of the relation in the highest ssfr bin ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "this was already noted by @xcite for sbzk galaxies at @xmath189 , but we find a similar trend at @xmath2 and we plot their results with open triangles .",
    "direct comparison of the absolute values is difficult due to different stellar mass limits .",
    "galaxies in this work are more massive than those in @xcite .",

    "now we investigate the same quantities using galaxies in different stellar mass bins , in order to check the influence of stellar mass as the negative main sequence slope on the ssfr  mass plane could arise from a selection bias toward high ssfr galaxies that are in less massive haloes and hence are less clustered . to assess the level of this potential bias we further split galaxies into different stellar mass bins of @xmath156 ( low mass , lm ) and @xmath197 ( high mass , hm ) with the same ssfr bins mentioned above .",
    "unfortunately , it is hard to measure the secure angular correlation function of star - forming galaxies with @xmath126 divided into various ssfr bins because of the small number of objects .",

    "we confirm the anti - correlation in the ssfr@xmath9 relation in the low ssfr regime of star - forming galaxies and at lower significance the reversal of the relation at @xmath10 shown in figure  [ figbssfr ] .",
    "this means that the feature shown in figure  [ figbssfr ] is mainly caused by an environmental effect connecting the halo occupation of high ssfr galaxies to the mass of their host halo and not due to an effect intrinsic to their stellar mass .",
    "one difference between two mass bins is the ssfr value showing the lowest halo mass .",
    "although the uncertainty is substantial , hm star - forming galaxies with the lowest halo mass have lower ssfr than lm ones . considering the slope for main sequence galaxies in figure  [ figmssfr ] , galaxies on the upper envelope of the main sequence in each stellar mass bin reside in the lowest mass haloes .",

    "downward arrows at the bottom are central ssfr values of the main sequence for each stellar mass bin.[figmssfrmb ] ]    finally , it is worth comparing our results to the known ssfr  local density relation .",
    "first , @xcite found the same anti - correlation at @xmath2 over the similar ssfr range from the deep2 survey .",
    "in addition , we can also see a suggestion of a weak reverse relation in the highest ssfr bin ( see figure 9 in their paper ) .",
    "second , @xcite also reported the similar trend at @xmath199 based on the akari north ecliptic pole ( nep ) wide survey and a2255 from the akari clusters of galaxies evolution studies ( clevl ; i m et al .",
    "2008 ; lee et al .",
    "although @xcite focused on the very low redshift , there is no significant difference in the bias ",
    "ssfr relations at low and high redshifts as we already mentioned above .",
    "moreover , their field coverage is wide enough to study the relation from low to high local densities . in conclusion",
    ", our results also show good agreement with local density studies .",
    "in the previous section , we found a clear dependence of clustering strength on ssfr . here , we further investigate the property of galaxies in the highest ssfr bin , which are in denser environments than main sequence star - forming galaxies , and we present a possible scenario for the evolution of star - forming galaxies .",
    "we begin with the comparison of the internal dust attenuation of @xmath72 derived from sed fitting .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ figebvcol ] shows the @xmath72 distribution of the highest ssfr galaxies ( @xmath184 ) and the main sequence galaxies ( @xmath200 ) with solid and dotted histograms , respectively .",
    "in addition , galaxies are also split into two stellar mass bins of @xmath201 ( blue ) and @xmath131 ( red ) .",

    "the median values of @xmath72 for the highest ssfr bin is 0.45 and 0.55 for @xmath201 and @xmath131 galaxies , respectively .",
    "however , those for main sequence galaxies in the same stellar mass bins are 0.375 and 0.45 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that high ssfr galaxies are more heavily obscured at a given stellar mass and in strongly biased regions than the main sequence galaxies .",
    "@xcite categorized high ssfr galaxies as dusty , blue star - forming galaxies , and noted that they are possibly merger driven starburst galaxies .",
    "we also show in figure  [ figebvcol ] the distribution of @xmath202 color ( bottom ) corresponding to the rest - frame uv  optical color .",
    "the line styles are the same as the top panel .",
    "this bluer color is also confirmed by the best fit sed in figure  [ figsedexam ] .",
    "the bottom panels in figure  [ figsedexam ] are examples of high ssfr galaxies . compared to main sequence galaxies ( middle panels in figure  [ figsedexam ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that high ssfr galaxies show significantly higher fluxes in the rest - frame uv regime .",
    "although there is a significant overlap , high ssfr galaxies are either relatively blue @xmath202 color or have a higher extinction suggesting the presence of an obscured young stellar population .",
    "( top ) and @xmath202 color ( bottom ) distributions of galaxies with @xmath201 ( blue ) and @xmath131 ( red ) .",
    "solid and dotted histograms are for the highest ssfr galaxies ( @xmath203 ) and main sequence ones ( @xmath200 ) , respectively .",
    "the inset shows the cumulative distribution with the same line style to the main panel .",
    "the highest ssfr galaxies are more heavily obscured and show relatively bluer colors than main sequence galaxies at a given stellar mass.[figebvcol ] ]    although these high ssfr galaxies are most likely to be obscured galaxies with efficient star formation , their colors could also be strongly affected by the presence of an agn . from the previous work based on the clustering ,",
    "agn reside in dark matter haloes of @xmath204 ( e.g. , hickox et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ; ross et al . 2009b",
    "; also see a review in cappelluti et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly , this halo mass is consistent to our result for high ssfr galaxies .",
    "therefore , in order to test the possibility of agn contamination , we check the fraction of agn in this high ssfr bin . using _",
    "sources mentioned above , we select 75 potential agn with irac colors suggested by @xcite . among these agn ,",
    "15 sources are in the highest ssfr bin , and this corresponds to @xmath158.8% of all irac sources matched with our galaxies in the same ssfr bin .",
    "in addition to _ spitzer _ data , we also select potential agn in the whole studied area from the _ wide  field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) _ with a simple color cut suggested by @xcite . although the depth of _ wise _ data is not enough to detect faint agn , the wide area is helpful to measure the clustering after excluding bright agn .",
    "we remove potential _",
    "wise _ agn from our high ssfr galaxies , and then measure the clustering again .",
    "the fractions of galaxies excluded are 3.6% in the lm bin and 8.9% in the hm bin .",
    "the re - measured clusterings are identical to those for the previous measurements in both bins . since the triggering mechanism for agn is not well understood yet , we can not rule out the connection between high ssfr galaxies and agn . however , our result for the highest ssfr bin is not biased by agn .",
    "above , we noted that galaxies with the highest ssfr reside in more massive haloes than main sequence galaxies .",
    "there are numerous reports in the literature that the star formation activity is enhanced by merger or the tidal interaction of galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also reported that starburst galaxies driven by mergers form stars more efficiently than normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "furthermore , it has been thought that these processes more easily occur in dense environments such as galaxy groups @xcite .",
    "so when combined with the observation that these galaxies are dustier and form stars efficiently , it suggests that high ssfr galaxies can be generated by mergers or interaction .",
    "also , since massive galaxies usually reside in massive haloes , high ssfr hm galaxies experience the processes in massive haloes imprinting the @xmath150.4 dex high halo mass compared to high ssfr lm galaxies as seen in figure  [ figmssfrmb ] .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite who speculated that galaxies with the highest ssfr might be linked to mergers or interactions in haloes more massive than those hosting main sequence galaxies .",
    "another possible explanation for high ssfr galaxies is that they are primarily in massive haloes like galaxy with enhanced star formation at @xmath189 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that galaxies forming stars actively at @xmath189 are a different population from similar objects at @xmath205 , based on the comparison of clustering strengths .",
    "they reported the halo mass of @xmath206 , and they evolve into passive galaxies at @xmath207 .",
    "the halo mass is consistent with that for our high ssfr samples .",
    "moreover , @xcite also find that most ir - luminous galaxies at @xmath32 reside in the group environment , which is also similar to that for our high ssfr galaxies . in this sense",
    ", our high ssfr galaxies may be in the transition phase experiencing a rapid evolution to a passive population .",
    "now , we recall the hods in figure  [ figmbin ] to interpret figure  [ figmssfrmb ] .",
    "first , we briefly note the halo mass difference measured by the halo model and the fit of dark matter clustering , since we directly estimate the bias with the dark matter clustering for ssfr binned samples .",
    "as we discuss in appendix  [ app2 ] , the halo mass from the dark matter clustering fit is between representative halo masses for central and satellite galaxies from the halo model . if there are more satellites , this becomes closer to that for satellites .",
    "furthermore , @xmath109 of dark matter haloes from the halo model is more significantly influenced by satellites . in figure",
    "[ figmssfrmb ] , the horizontal dashed lines are @xmath109 values for all galaxies in each stellar mass bin .    for lm galaxies , @xmath109 for all galaxies from the halo model is @xmath208 which is at the higher halo mass regime than the hod for central galaxies in figure  [ figmbin ] . therefore , if the halo mass is larger than this @xmath109 , we are able to conclude that satellite galaxies dominantly influence the clustering . of lm samples ,",
    "galaxies with @xmath209 show halo masses of @xmath210 .",
    "this means that these low ssfr lm galaxies mainly consist of satellites .",
    "in contrast , the halo mass for @xmath185 galaxies corresponding to the upper part of the main sequence is below @xmath109 , which implies that the significant fraction of them is central galaxies .",
    "however , in the case of hm galaxies , it is more complex than lm galaxies . from figure  [ figmbin ]",
    ", it can be seen that the central hod spans a wide halo mass range . moreover , the @xmath109 value for all hm galaxies is @xmath211 , and this is just above the peak of the central hod .",
    "therefore , we can reasonably expect a significant contribution from central galaxies to the clustering . from figure  [ figmssfrmb ] ,",
    "the overall trend for hm star - forming galaxies is similar to that for lm star - forming ones .",
    "however , all halo masses do not exceed the range of the central hod of the middle panel in figure  [ figmbin ] , and correspond to halo masses of @xmath212 , except the highest ssfr bin .",
    "this also confirms that the important contribution of central galaxies to the clustering .",
    "what we also find is that the lowest halo mass appears in @xmath186 , which is the lower ssfr bin than that for lm galaxies , and corresponds to the upper envelope of the star - forming main sequence in figure  [ figmssfr ] .",
    "another striking feature is the halo mass of passive galaxies .",
    "we already discussed the dependence on stellar masses in the previous section .",
    "however , the halo mass of passive galaxies is also similar to @xmath109 of all galaxies in each stellar mass bin .",
    "this implies that the influence of central passive galaxies is also significant as well as satellites , even in the lm bin .",
    "moreover , the halo masses for both stellar mass bins are within the range of central hods in figure  [ figmbin ] .",
    "in fact , the fractions of passive galaxies are 24% and 50% in the lm and hm bins , respectively . even if we assume that all satellites are passive galaxies , these values are much larger than the satellite fraction for all galaxies from the hod in figure  [ figparbin ] , and confirm the substantial contribution of central passive galaxies to the clustering .",
    "additionally , @xcite found that red central galaxies tend to be in slightly more massive haloes than blue central galaxies based on sdss data .",
    "therefore , the higher halo mass for passive galaxies than main sequence ones can be explained by the high mass of haloes hosting passive central galaxies as well as passive satellites .",
    "the complexity of figure  [ figmssfrmb ] highlights the potential of hod analysis to identify subtle environmental and evolutionary trends if a sufficiently large and well constrained sample of galaxies is studied .",
    "based on our results for @xmath1 galaxies at @xmath2 , the clustering of main sequence galaxies , which shows the lowest halo mass , is most significantly affected by central galaxies .",
    "given the hierarchical growth of structure and the expected evolution of main sequence star - forming galaxies , it would be expected that these central galaxies could become satellite galaxies via accretion on to massive haloes or remain as central galaxies with the assembly of stellar and halo masses . during this accretion , and whilst orbiting as satellites",
    ", they would undergo environmental quenching of their star formation ( e.g. , from ram pressure stripping , tidal harassment or starvation ) , which would explain the high halo masses associated with low ssfr galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the population with enhanced star formation activity are in relatively massive haloes of group like environments , and a subdominant population at @xmath2 . in our data ,",
    "the fraction of @xmath184 galaxies with @xmath1 is @xmath1510% of all galaxies , which is similar to the measured merger rates at @xmath40 from previous studies @xcite .",
    "therefore , galaxy mergers play a subdominant role for the evolution of star - forming galaxies at this epoch , even if we assume all high ssfr galaxies experience mergers or interaction .",
    "recently @xcite also concluded that galaxy mergers are not a dominant source of stellar mass growth at @xmath205 .",
    "additionally , the significant fraction of passive galaxies are central ones which weakens the clustering strength compared to a satellite dominated sample .",
    "these passive central galaxies may originate in star - forming central galaxies passively evolving , or galaxy mergers with the central galaxy accelerating the consumption of gas .",
    "@xcite concluded that the secular processes are the dominant mechanism for the evolution of galaxies , which means that galaxies evolve from a low @xmath0high ssfr to a high @xmath0low ssfr regime through star formation within the galaxy , and that galaxy mergers play a subdominant role .",
    "moreover , @xcite claimed that the stellar mass function of passive central galaxies has significantly increased since @xmath40 , especially at @xmath213 .",
    "our results show that main sequence galaxies are mainly central galaxies , and a significant fraction of them evolve into low ssfr central galaxies together with the decreased star formation activity and the increased stellar and halo masses .",
    "therefore , our result also supports the suggestion that the bulk of @xmath1 star - forming galaxies at @xmath2 follow secular evolution ( orange arrow in figure  [ figmssfrmb ] ) supplemented by minor mergers with galaxies fainter than our stellar mass limit accounting for the bulk of their growth .",
    "this was also suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additionally , a similar trend was found at @xmath189 @xcite and the local universe @xcite which implies that this is the main evolutionary mechanism of star - forming galaxies over the last 10 gyr .",
    "importantly , the magnitude limit of our survey allows us to detect both galaxies that would give rise to a major merger within any halo so in principle it would be possible to constrain the major merger rate once the redshifts of a representative sub - sample of pairs is determined .",
    "in this work , we have used deep and wide datasets based on ukidss dxs and cfhtls  wide surveys to investigate the dependence of galaxy clustering on intrinsic properties and how galaxies are linked with their host haloes .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows ;    1 .",
    "using deep and wide near - ir / optical imaging data of the sa22 field , we have constructed a mass - limited sample of galaxies at @xmath57 .",
    "the redshift selection is based on photometric redshifts , and galaxy properties such as stellar masses and ssfrs were derived using sed fitting . in total , this sample consists of 66,864 galaxies with @xmath1 and @xmath214 in this redshift range .",
    "2 .   splitting the selected galaxies at different stellar mass thresholds , we measured the angular two - point correlation function and performed the halo modeling to link galaxies with host dark matter haloes .",
    "we found that more massive galaxies reside in more massive haloes , and tend to be central galaxies .",
    "the hods for stellar mass binned galaxies were calculated by those for stellar mass threshold samples . in all bins ,",
    "satellites are predominantly in @xmath215 haloes . moreover , the mass of haloes hosting central galaxies is higher for massive galaxies with a broader distribution in halo mass than that found for less massive galaxies .",
    "the hods for stellar mass binned samples were used to calculate the stellar mass to halo mass ratio for central and satellite galaxies separately . for central galaxies",
    "this ratio shows a peak at @xmath158 that drops sharply above and below this halo mass , indicating the most efficient stellar mass growth at this peak halo mass . on the other hand",
    ", satellite galaxies significantly contribute to the total stellar mass in group and cluster environments .",
    "we find an anti - correlation between bias and ssfr for low ssfr star - forming galaxies that are at or below the main sequence ( @xmath216 ) , implying that star - forming galaxies at around the main sequence tend to live in a less massive halo ( @xmath217 ) while low ssfr or passive galaxies are more likely to be in massive haloes ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "however , we also see a reversal of this relation for galaxies in the highest ssfr bin ( @xmath203 ) that galaxies with the highest ssfrs are in dense environments . this can be seen regardless of the stellar mass of galaxies .",
    "we speculate that the bulk of galaxies evolves from on or above the main sequence of star - forming galaxies to a lower ssfr regime as their mass assembles through forming new stars and minor mergers . additionally , major mergers happen in relatively massive haloes , and contribute to the galaxy evolution sub - dominantly at @xmath2 .",
    "our results are derived from deep and wide multiwavelength datasets .",
    "nevertheless , this work is based on the only photometric data for relatively massive galaxies in a specific redshift bin and thus it is difficult to avoid contamination . in the future ,",
    "deeper and wider datasets such as those from the ukidss , vista , subaru hyper - suprime camera , pan - starrs and lsst surveys will provide an opportunity to investigate more details about the relationship between various galaxy properties and their host dark matter haloes with less massive galaxies and in various redshift bins .",
    "additionally , spectroscopic surveys will also allow further progress on the clustering analysis . in terms of parameterized hods",
    ", we have assumed that the central hod becomes unity after a certain halo mass .",
    "however , agn feedback may change the shape of central hods , especially the maximum mean number for central galaxies .",
    "therefore it may also be necessary to modify the standard hod work in order to directly compare observations and models once the samples have increased sufficiently .",

    "as desribed in   [ hod ] , the halo model with three free parameters was applied to derive the property of haloes hosting our galaxy sample . in this case , @xmath101 was determined by matching the observed galaxy number density with given parameters . in order to check the influence of this constraint to the best fit result , we investigate the best fit parameters without this constraint .",
    "therefore , we perform the halo modeling for @xmath219 and @xmath220 galaxies with four free parameters ( @xmath102 , @xmath101 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) . in this case , @xmath115 is derived by the best fit hod parameters describing the clustering only .",
    "figure  [ fignong ] shows the angular correlation function ( upper ) and the hod ( lower ) for each galaxy sample .",
    "all symbols are the same as figure  [ figmth ] . however , the solid line in the upper panel and the hod in the lower panel are the result based on the halo model with four free parameters .",
    "the best fit parameters are listed in table  [ tparanong ] . comparing the values in table  [ tparam ] and  [ tparanong ] , the derived values of @xmath110 and @xmath109 are identical , and",
    "other halo mass parameters also show the same trend .",
    "in addition , the central hod for massive galaxies ( @xmath2210.4 ) still shows the gentler shape than that for low mass galaxies ( @xmath2210.1 ) , which indicates that the constraint by the galaxy number density does not affect the trend of the fitting results .",
    "however , @xmath101 and @xmath104 without the @xmath115 constraint are approximately a factor of 2 smaller than those with the constraint , and @xmath102 values also decrease from 0.5 and 0.6 to 0.1 and 0.4 for @xmath219 and @xmath220 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the number densities calculated by the model without the constraint are higher than observed ones .",
    "this mismatch was already reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is not yet answered what is the main reason leading to this mismatch .",
    "more studies are necessary to resolve this problem .     for @xmath219 and @xmath220 galaxies .",
    "all symbols are the same as figure  [ figmth ] .",
    "however , we used four free parameters for the halo modeling . as a result ,",
    "the trend of derived parameters depending on @xmath0 is same to figure  [ figmth ] , although values are different.[fignong ] ]",
    "in order to link galaxies to their host dark matter haloes , we performed the halo modeling for stellar mass threshold samples and the direct fit of correlation functions of dark matters for stellar mass binned samples and ssfr binned samples . here , we apply the later method to the stellar mass threshold samples , and then compare bias and halo mass from this fit ( quoted as dm fit , hereafter ) to the best fit result from the halo model .",
    "this comparison will provide a guideline for our analysis .",
    "figure  [ figcomp2met ] shows the comparison between the halo model ( open symbols ) in table  [ tparam ] and the fit of dark matter clustering ( filled symbols ) .",
    "first , we are able to notice that the bias is consistent independently of the method ( upper panel ) . however , in the case of halo masses , they show different results .",
    "the halo mass from the dm fit is close to @xmath109 from the halo model , but shows a discrepancy , especially for low mass galaxies .",
    "this is easily explained by the fraction of satellites , since satellites are in massive haloes .",
    "in addition , @xmath109 is close to @xmath104 at the low stellar mass regime , but @xmath101 at the high mass regime , which is also explained by the same reason .",
    "although the bias estimated by fitting the dark matter clustering do not perfectly represent the mass of haloes hosting galaxies selected , representative halo masses for central and satellite galaxies well bracket the halo mass by the dm fit .",
    "therefore , the halo mass for central galaxies is always lower than that by the dm fit ."

    "<S> the ratio for central galaxies shows a peak at @xmath6 , and satellites predominantly contribute to the total stellar mass in cluster environments with @xmath5 values of 0.010.02 . using star - forming galaxies split by ssfr , we find that main sequence galaxies ( @xmath7 ) are mainly central galaxies in @xmath8 haloes with the lowest clustering amplitude , while lower ssfr galaxies consist of a mixture of both central and satellite galaxies where those with the lowest @xmath0 are predominantly satellites influenced by their environment . </S>",
    "<S> considering the lowest @xmath9 samples in each @xmath0 bin , massive central galaxies reside in more massive haloes with lower ssfrs than low mass ones , indicating star - forming central galaxies evolve from a low @xmath0high ssfr to a high @xmath0low ssfr regime . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the most rapidly star - forming galaxies ( @xmath10 ) are in more massive haloes than main sequence ones , possibly implying galaxy mergers in dense environments are driving the active star formation . </S>",
    "<S> these results support the conclusion that the majority of star - forming galaxies follow secular evolution through the sustained but decreasing formation of stars . </S>"
