    "type ii supernovae ( sne ) are classified by the presence of h in their spectra and sub - classes are based on their observed light curves .",
    "they are most likely caused from the gravitational collapse of a main sequence stars with m @xmath2 8 - 10 @xmath3 .",
    "the differences in type ii light curves was first pointed out by pskovskii ( 1978 ) by introducing the beta parameter which resulted in a continuous classification based on the slope of the light curve .",
    "another study showed that light curves can be differentiated into two distinctive sub - classes , plateaus and linears @xcite .",
    "pata et al . (",
    "1994 ) , using a multivariable factor analysis , introduced a new classification based on an absolute peak magnitude vs. @xmath4 graph resulting in three sub - classes ; bright ( includes both plateaus and linears ) , normal ( includes both plateaus and linears ) , and faint .",
    "good observations of plateau sne such as sn 1969l , sn 1987a , sn 1993j and recently sn 1999em and sn 1999gi are usually followed by extensive theoretical light curve ( lc ) studies .",

    "they showed that relations between explosion energy , envelope mass , and progenitor radius can be obtained from observations of plateau duration , the absolute magnitude and the photospheric velocity .",
    "we are currently preparing a paper investigating a comparison between supernovae of evolved numerical stars and polytrope stars using the method @xcite .",

    "young and branch ( 1989 ) compared observed type iip light curves on an absolute magnitude scale and found a large spread in absolute magnitude , their plateau duration , and slope of the tails , attributing it to differences in the physical properties of the progenitor .",
    "these studies indicate that the parameter space is quite large for the progenitor of type ii sne and it is difficult to say what type of progenitor will explode or not .",
    "what is needed is a parameter study that encompasses all variables and all combinations , but this is unfeasible .",
    "therefore the aim of this and future studies is to have a standard sn model with parameters that are consistent with knowledge of progenitor stars , explosion mechanisms , and hydrodynamics .",
    "it is then of interest to see if all observed light curves can fit into this model and how far in parameter space they deviate from the standard model . in this study",
    "the standard model is a 20  main sequence star that has gone through a wind mass loss of 2 , left a neutron star of 1.4 , thus ejecting about 16  with a progenitor radius of 3@xmath8 cm .",

    "the parameter space around this model is explored .",
    "+ in this paper i show the results of how varying each parameter can influence the shape and absolute magnitude of type ii light curves out to 400 days .",
    "the five parameters explored in this study are ; the progenitor radius , envelope mass , explosion energy , @xmath1ni mass , and @xmath1ni mixing . all light curves calculated in this paper use the numerically evolved 20 @xmath0  main sequence model with a 6   helium core from woosley and weaver ( 1980 ) .",
    "the envelope parameters , mass and radius , are varied using homology transformations ( section 2 ) .",
    "the models are then exploded in a one dimensional , flux - limited hydrodynamical code with a simple prescription for gamma - ray deposition ( section 3 ) .",
    "the bolometric light curves are calculated and plotted on an absolute magnitude scale ( section 4 ) .",
    "the results are discussed in section 5 .",

    "the envelope mass and radius are subsequently modified in a systematic way .",
    "a total of 8 models were constructed that are identified by a specific mass and radius ( table i ) . in this study three",
    "different envelope masses were used producing total masses of 8 , 12 , and 16 @xmath0 . for each envelope mass , three different radii where used 43 r@xmath6 ( @xmath9 cm ) , 430 r@xmath6 ( @xmath10 cm ) , and 4300 r@xmath6 ( @xmath11 cm ) .",
    "the original h rich envelope was modified by homologous transformations to give the various masses and radii @xcite .    for a homologous transformation in radius : @xmath12 where r is the old radius , r@xmath13 is the new radius , and @xmath14 is the percent changed . for a homologous transformation in mass : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the ratio of the gas pressure to the total pressure for the star before and after the homologous transformation . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are initial and final mass , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mean molecular weights for the initial and final configuration . following either of these calculations the remaining physical variables , @xmath22 and t , must be solved to ensure hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the homologous transformation is performed on the hydrogen envelope only and then matched to the he core .",
    "the core and various envelopes were then re - zoned to ensure a continuous density , temperature and radius .",
    "eight progenitor models in all were constructed for this study each having 170 zones in order to have consistent results for opacity floors ( opacity minimum ) and gamma - ray deposition which are used to calculate zone dependent quantities like the photosphere and the gamma - ray contribution to the luminosity ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the innermost 1.4 @xmath3 is assumed to form a neutron star and is removed from the core , but set as an inner boundary condition in the explosions . +",
    "the constructed models are in hydrostatic equilibrium but not necessarily in radiative equilibrium .",
    "this should not be a problem since the shock moves through the star in 6 to 240 hours .",
    "radiative equilibrium is important concerning the validity of the model stars representing real stars , but the point of this study is to compare various simple models and see how the lc responds .",
    "+ three different final explosion energies , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ergs are obtained by artificially placing the required energy , divided between kinetic and thermal , in the first few mass zones .",
    "this procedure is justifiable since the explosion mechanism for type ii sne is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "furthermore , the type of shock is only important in the nucleosynthesis ( aufderheide 1991 ) which is not included in our study .",
    "the radiation - hydrodyanmics code given to the author @xcite contains the following attributes ; spherically symmetric , 1-d , lagrangian , flux - limited code which uses pseudo - viscosity and determines opacities calculated for hydrogen , helium , and oxygen rich layers .",
    "modifications included a geometric dilution model for gamma - ray deposition , and updated opacity tables @xcite .",
    "rayleigh - taylor mixing and nuclear reactions are not included in the calculations .",
    "the rosseland mean opacities are tabulated as functions of composition , temperature , and density , assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "two effects not included in the rosseland mean are line opacities and non - thermal excitation or ionization from gamma rays . in order to account for these",
    "affects an opacity minimum ( opacity floor ) is set at 0.25 @xmath26 g@xmath27 for the helium rich core and 0.01 @xmath26 g@xmath27 for the hydrogen rich envelope . +",
    "the lc calculation is done in two steps , first the hydrodynamics is calculated , then in a second step the gamma - ray deposition is included in the computation .",
    "the prescription for absorbed gamma rays requires calculating a deposition function following sutherland and wheeler ( 1984 ) at interval times of 3.5@xmath28 sec from 0 to 400 days .",
    "the deposition function calculates the diffusion of gamma - rays from the location they are produced to regions outside the ni distribution , including gamma - rays escaping the ejecta . in the first step one",
    "obtains the time evolution of density and volume of the ejecta that is necessary to calculate the absorbed gamma rays .",
    "the energy produced by the gamma rays is not enough to affect the hydrodynamics and thus is not necessary to be included in the primary run .",
    "this saves computation time , avoiding a calculation of the deposition function at each time step .",
    "+ the @xmath1ni mass is varied using 3 different masses of 0.035 , 0.07 , and 0.14 @xmath0 which are mixed to three different regions ; less than 0.3 @xmath0 , 6 @xmath0 ( he core ) , and 11 @xmath0 ( core plus half the envelope , 7 @xmath0 for model g ) . the ni distribution is a step function resulting in a uniform spherical distribution of @xmath1ni . as the ejecta becomes thin , the gamma rays deposit energy in a symmetric sphere outside the @xmath1ni distribution .",
    "the mixing of @xmath1ni is artificial since we are not mixing the composition along with it , but the goal of this study is not to create a rigorous model , only to explore the major parameters that influence the lc .",
    "however it has been shown that the mixing of h into the he layer does affect the lc as seen in sn1987a @xcite .",

    "+ the optical photosphere is defined to be where @xmath36=2/3 , integrating inward from the surface . the optical opacities are calculated and tabulated using bound - bound , free - free and bound - free transitions for multi - level atoms of h , he , c , o , si , fe . these tables were made for calculations where the h envelope was metal deficient , such as sn 1987a .",
    "this is not a problem in lc calculations because in the region where the optical depth is high most of the opacity comes from electron scattering and the metal lines are an insignificant contribution . in the optically thin regions the opacity is so low that the contribution of metal lines to the opacity is small .",

    "when the gammasphere has receded through the ejecta the energy source of the lc is just the spontaneous release of energy deposited by the decay of ni - co - fe .",

    "these are similar to the values of sn 1987a except with a larger radius , taking into consideration that sn 1987a might have had a nonstandard radius .",

    "a general overview of the lc can be explained as follows .",
    "the lc gets its energy from two sources , deposited shock energy and deposited gamma rays .",
    "almost always the early light curve ( @xmath53 50 days ) is powered by the diffusive release of internal energy deposited by the shock wave as it propagates through the envelope .",
    "the middle lc ( 50 - 120 days ) , the plateau and secondary peak , is one or a combination of both energy sources .",
    "this region makes a transition from being powered by deposited shock energy to deposited gamma - ray energy . and the late time light curve ( @xmath2 120 days ) , the tail , is powered by the instantaneous energy of deposited gamma rays . throughout the simulation",
    "the luminosity is determined by the position of the photosphere calculated by integrating the opacity times the density from the surface inward .",
    "as the model expands the opacity and density fall and the photosphere moves inward .",
    "this movement of the photosphere toward the center of the model is called the recombination wave ( rw ) .",
    "+      in brief :    * larger progenitor radii produce a brighter early lc , and a longer and brighter plateau / secondary peak * the progenitor radius has no affect on the late - time light curve * the sn light curve of the smaller progenitor radii are dramatically influenced by the affects of ni    the progenitor radius has a significant affect on the early lc and little or no influence at all on the late lc .",
    "the light curve begins when the shock wave hits the surface .",
    "once the shock breaks out the progenitor radius is the primary variable in determining the luminosity .",
    "larger radii progenitors are already pre - expanded , have a large surface area , and produce a very bright peak ( fig .",
    "1a , b ) . at late times",
    "the initial radius has little affect on the gamma - ray deposition .",
    "+ the initial delay in the light curve larger radii progenitors is due to the shock taking longer to arrive at the surface .",
    "the shock wave can be identified in figure 2 by the deviation of the long dashed lines and the solid lines for each of the three models .",
    "the time the shock wave spends inside the largest radius progenitor is 8 days compared to 2 hours for the smallest radius .",
    "it can be seen in figs . 2a , and 2c that the shock in model a has already reached the surface by t = 4.2 hours , while both models b and c have shocks moving down the density gradient near 10 m@xmath6 and 7.5 m@xmath6 , respectively . in figure 2c",
    "the temperature profiles clearly show a forward shock and a reverse shock forming an mesa in the middle . in the largest radii model",
    "the deposited shock energy will not do as much pdv work , since it is already in an expanded state when the shock arrives , and the material will stay hotter longer .",
    "once the shock wave emerges for models with increasingly larger radii the radiation has a smaller diffusion time and the photon flux is higher accounting for the progressively broader initial peak and plateau .",
    "a comparison of the diffusion times between the three models clarifies this ; the ratio of model a to b is 10 , model a to c is 100 using diffusion time scale at constant opacity @xmath54 3@xmath55m/(4@xmath56rc ) .",
    "+ the initial peak of model c has a 4 day rise time compared to the almost instantaneous rise time of models a and b ( see fig .",
    "1a , 1b , 1c , 2d ) . this can be explained by the behavior of the shock wave in low , constant density material .",
    "as the shock nears the surface of model c it becomes smoothed out and looses it",
    "s `` shock '' definition and more mass has a higher temperature , giving a broad peak to the photosperic temperature evolution .",
    "this is unlike the smaller radii models which have a sharper , more defined shock and thus achieves a higher temperature , but then expands and cools faster .",
    "+ the difference between the radii can explain the maximum lc luminosity even though the photospheric temperature in the largest radii model is lower .",
    "the ratio of the largest to smallest radius model is 100 , while the ratio of the breakout temperature is only about 2.5 ( fig .",
    "this leads to a factor of about 256 brighter in luminosity ( 6 in magnitude , figs . 1a , 1c , 1d ) for the larger radius progenitor .",
    "for smaller stars much more of the internal energy deposited by the shock is transformed into pdv work in order to unbind the star .",
    "the initial burst is much brighter , seen as a spike , but falls rapidly with the expansion .",
    "+ at late times the luminosity profiles are a useful diagnostic for the gamma - ray deposition .",
    "all three models are shown at t = 94 days ( model a long dash , b dotted , c small dash ) , and have indistinguishable luminosity profiles at t = 189 ( solid lines ) , and 379 ( dark solid lines ) .",
    "the curves at t = 189 and 379 days are understandable since once the ejecta is in homologous expansion the velocity and density ( figs .",
    "2a , 2b ) profiles have similar shapes and thus give similar gamma - ray depositions . the absolute magnitude and slope of the lc tails ( figs .",
    "1 and 3 ) are similar since it is the mass of ni and the expansion velocities which are important in the deposition of gamma rays .",
    "+ the visual light curve ( fig .",
    "1c ) is shown for comparison to observations in the v band .",
    "the radioactive tails all have a similar shape to figure 1a but reduced in brightness .",
    "this shift is just due to the temperature being constrained , a temperature floor , when convolving with the v band filters .",
    "the temperature floor is set at 4500 k. the photospheric velocity ( fig .",
    "1d ) for the different models show the largest differences quite early and converge at about 100 days .",
    "after day 35 the v@xmath47 is systematically higher for the larger radius model because the ejecta is evolving slower and thus the photosphere recedes inward at a slower rate . in the smallest radius model",
    "it is interesting that the increase in the photospheric temperature during the secondary peak does not influence the photospheric velocity .",
    "this is due to the photosphere residing in the he core and at temperatures of about 6000 k can not ionize the he . + the recombination wave is an indictor of the dynamics of the temperature and density of the different models . to gauge the dynamics",
    "it is instructive to list the times of when each model is completely through the h envelope ; smallest to largest progenitor radius , 42 , 70 , and 104 days ( vertical arrows in figure 1b ) .",
    "these models reach the center of the model , completely through the he core , at 60 , 103 , and 113 days , respectively ( vertical lines in figure 1b ) .",
    "figure 3a shows that increasing the explosion energy has an increasing affect on larger radii progenitors .",
    "the early lc gets progressively brighter as the progenitor radius is increased because the rw moves inward more rapidly and more of the shock energy gets radiated faster .",
    "thus the characteristic features of the lc , the peak , plateau , and onset of the radioactive tail , are seen at earlier times .",
    "after 200 days the material has expanded enough that gamma rays have started to escape and the lc begins to show a steeper slope due to the increased velocity profile of each model being higher than for models presented in figure 1a ( see affects of energy section ) .",
    "+ figure 3b shows that placing all the ni at the center delays the affects of the deposited gamma rays and effectively traps more gamma rays at later times .",
    "this has a pronounced affect on the smaller radius progenitors since most of the plateau and secondary peak is powered by @xmath1ni .",
    "thus the plateau dips to even lower luminosities to indicate even more dramatically where the change from shock energy to deposited gamma rays occurs .",
    "the secondary peak then appears later , flatter , and fainter .",
    "+ figure 3c shows that reducing the mass of the h envelope produces a light curve that shows features like the onset and duration of the plateau , at earlier times . because of a lower h mass the photosphere can move more quickly through the envelope , producing a brighter and faster light curve .",
    "the velocity , e / m , is faster than in figure 1a and thus the slope of the tail is steeper .",
    "the discrepancy of the tails at late times is due to the velocity profile of the he core ( fig . 2b ) .",
    "the 8 m@xmath6 models with only 2 m@xmath6 of h envelope have a larger percent of the mass with different velocity profiles than the 16 m@xmath6 models .",
    "this is the reason why the spreading of the tails was not seen in the case where the explosion energy was increased to @xmath24 ergs ( fig .",
    "3a ) . in that case",
    "the velocity profiles were just scaled to higher velocities ( also see affects of mass section ) .",
    "+ figure 3d shows that the ni mass affects the smaller radius progenitors more , reducing the plateau dip slightly and scaling down the entire secondary peak .",
    "the largest radius model is unaffected by the change during the initial peak , plateau , and secondary peak .",
    "however the luminosity drops further after the secondary peak to meet the tails of the other models .",
    "the tails also have the same slope as figure 1a only scaled down in absolute magnitude by about 1 magnitude .      in brief",
    ":    * increasing the mass of the h envelope causes all the lc features ( plateau , secondary peak , and tail ) to appear at later times * increasing the h envelope mass produces a fainter early lc and a slowly declining radioactive tail * reducing the h envelope mass changes the final density profiles causing the lc tail to be very steep    the general trends seen in figures 4 - 6 show that a more massive envelope results in a fainter early lc , a more pronounced plateau and secondary peak , and a slower decline of the tail .",
    "the affect is due to the significant difference in the velocity profiles ( fig .",
    "increasing the ejected mass and keeping the explosion energies the same lowers the energy per gram , thus the velocity , and the characteristic features of the lc are seen at a later time , a slower lc is produced .",
    "+ the early lc is dependent on the mass because a larger mass envelope will have a longer diffusion time and thus trap the radiation longer and results in a fainter peak . during the plateau region",
    "a higher mass h envelope will take longer to expand and cool as seen by the different positions of the rw between the models at day 47 ( figs .",
    "5a and 5c ) .",

    "the affect of removing the h envelope causes the lc to have an earlier secondary peak similar to that seen from explosions of wolf - rayet stars @xcite .",
    "the secondary peak and the lc tail are not as bright compared to the other models due to the photophere receding faster into the center of the model and to the fewer absorbed gamma rays heating the material and adding to the luminosity .",

    "the diffusive release of shock energy was not influenced by the reduction of ni mass so no change in the early lc or most of the plateau is seen .",
    "the secondary peak is affected since it is partially powered by ni and figure 6c shows a reduction in its brightness and width .",

    "the secondary peak is much longer in duration due to the appearance of the large dip at 25 days .",

    "the explosion energy produces a larger e / m , energy per gram , and thus a higher overall velocity profile .",
    "the higher the explosion energy the more energy deposited , the higher the temperature and the brighter the early lc and plateau in most cases because they are powered by the release of deposited shock energy . the larger velocities expand and cool the material giving a faster rw and and a faster overall lc . at later times",
    "the lc tails for a higher explosion energy have steeper slopes , but not as much of an affect as when varying the mass ( see affects of mass ) .",
    "this can be understood from a comparison of velocity profiles . the velocity profile ( fig .",
    "8b ) shows that the final velocities do not differ by nearly as much as compared with figure 5b ( varying the m@xmath57 ) .",
    "furthermore the density profiles figure 8a and temperature profiles figure 8c show more similar profiles for different explosion energies than figures 5a and 5c . at late times",
    "the `` affects of energy '' series of models have very similar density and velocity profiles in comparison to the `` affects of mass''series of models .",
    "the similarity in velocity and density profiles accounts for the similarity in the lc tails in figure 7a .",

    "a comparison between changes in e or m@xmath57 also affects the photospheric temperature of the light curve . the photospheric temperature ( fig .",

    "4b ) . a comparison in the time difference of when the photospheric temperature drops to 4500 k between varying the energy and varying the mass shows this .",
    "when the energy is tripled the time difference is only 27 days as opposed to when the mass is just halved the difference is 57 days .",
    "thus the temperature of the photosphere is much more sensitive to a change in mass rather then a change in energy .",

    "this is understandable since the smaller the h envelope the faster the recombination wave and the faster the release of internal energy deposited by the shock . at late times",
    "the steeper tail can be explained by a higher overall velocity profile than figure 6b .",
    "this is due to the lowered h mass , and progressively more gamma rays escape with increasing explosion energy .",
    "+ figure 9b shows that when ni mixing is changed to @xmath53 0.3 m@xmath6 the early lc is exactly the same as in fig 1a .",
    "but the plateau and secondary peak are systematically affected more .",
    "there is a clear separation between the thermal and ni energy .",
    "this is seen as a more defined plateau / secondary peak .",
    "the tails are nearly the same since most of the gamma rays are absorbed .",
    "figure 9c shows that changing the radius to 4300 r@xmath6 distinguishes between the lc peak times which are about 1.4 and 1.7 times earlier for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 erg models respectively .",
    "the affects of a larger radius show a narrower range in the duration , slope , and absolute scale of the plateau as compared to the same graph comparing ejecta masses ( fig .",
    "the secondary peak is smaller in width and starts to blend with the plateau .",
    "this is due to more shock energy deposited into the h envelope and he core .",
    "the tail is almost identical to figure 7a but with a greater change in slope with increasing energy .",
    "again the influence is much smaller than with a variation in mass ( fig .",
    "+ figure 9d shows that when the ni mass is decreased the secondary peak gets increasingly fainter but more importantly the the width of the peak gets smaller with increasing energy .",
    "this means that as the explosion energy gets higher , the secondary peak is more powered by gamma - ray energy deposition , while the lower energy explosions have a longer diffusion time and the shock energy can still contribute to the secondary peak . at later times",
    "the slope of the tails are similar to figure 7a but scaled to lower absolute magnitudes .",
    "+      in brief :    * larger @xmath1ni mass produces brighter radioactive tails and plateaus / secondary peaks * models that have smaller radii are influenced more dramatically by the @xmath1ni mass * larger e / m and extensive @xmath1ni mixing reveals the @xmath1ni affects earlier and steeper slope of the tail    the general trend found when varying the @xmath1ni mass shows that as the @xmath1ni mass is increased the plateau , secondary peak and tail of the lc get brighter .",
    "the early lc is powered by deposited shock energy so changing the ni mass should not affect this part of the light curve . by about 20 to 50 days the photosphere moves into the region where gamma - ray deposition is important .",
    "the affects of ni mass are apparent by the difference in absolute magnitude and shape of the lcs . in figure 10a",
    "the affects of an increased gamma - ray deposition can be seen by all three lc s diverging at @xmath54 40 days . as the ni mass",
    "is increased the secondary peak increases in both absolute magnitude and width .",

    "at late times the v light curve have similar tail slopes but scaled to lower luminosity ( equation 3 ) . for comparison a model",
    "is shown that contains no ni mass and abrutly falls after the plateau .",
    "since having no ni mass eliminates the secondary peak it is reasonable to assume that ni heating plays a role in producing the secondary peak ( fig 10a ) .",
    "+ the plateau is actually lengthened by increased amount of ni as seen in all graphs to the point where it is almost doubled for 0.14 m@xmath6 ni . the time of the secondary peak maximum increases with increasing ni mass .",
    "this can be explained by the ni - co decay keeping the material hotter for a longer time , thus slowing the rw .",
    "figure 10b shows the photospheric temperature for the 0.14 m@xmath6 ni model stays hot for greater than 115 days , indicating that the gamma rays participate in the heating of the material below the photosphere .",
    "there is little change in the photopspheric velocity ( fig .",
    "10d ) which shows no difference until about 55 days .",
    "the slight difference in velocity after 55 days is due to an increase in the opacity , causing the photosphere to move into faster moving material .",
    "the slopes of all the tails ( figs .",
    "10a , 10c ) are similar since there is no variation in mass , energy , or ni mixing .",
    "this can be easily explained since all models have almost identical density , velocity , and temperature profiles figs .",
    "11a , 11b , 11c . in figure 11c the heating due to ni can be seen to slightly affect the temperature profile at day 47 in the region @xmath53 6 m@xmath6 .",
    "figure 11d shows the most predominate affect of ni mass .",
    "the luminosity profile directly reflects the amount of energy supplied by radioactivity , similar profiles but different absolute luminosities . in general since the only source of energy at lates times is the decay of co it is possible to estimate the ni mass based on the absolute magnitude of the tail .",
    "however , a lc tail with a steeper slope than the decay rate of co indicates that gamma rays are escaping the ejecta and thus an under - estimate of the ni mass would be obtained .",
    "+ figure 12a shows that lowering the h envelope mass enables ni to power the full plateau .",
    "the affects of ni appear at day 20 due to the recombination wave moving quickly through the low mass h envelope and uncover the regions heated by gamma rays faster . as the ni mass is increased the he core is kept hot enough to allow the rw to move more slowly . at later times",
    "the tails fall faster , when compared to figure 10a , due to the faster velocity , low density and thus less trapping of gamma rays .",
    "+ figure 12b shows that confining the ni to @xmath53 0.3 m@xmath6 delays the affects of the ni energy source and consequently the lc continues to fall 15 days longer than the other models in figure 10a .",
    "this is due to the ni taking longer to diffuses through more material .",
    "it also produces a broader and longer secondary peak which also lengthens the plateau .",
    "this is due to the ni being trapped longer and keeping the material hotter and thus keeping the rw from moving inward too quickly .",
    "+ figure 12c shows that increasing the radius lets the deposited shock energy power the lc for a longer time , since the affects of the ni mass are nt seen until 80 days ( whereas for fig .",
    "10a it is 40 days ) .",
    "varying the ni mass does nt have as much of an affect on the plateau or the secondary peak because the rw travels inward slower due to the longer diffusion time",
    ". just befor the secondary peak the photosphere moves through the he core the lcs start to diverage at about 140 days , showing that the model with the largest ni mass stays brighter for a longer time .",
    "+ figure 12d shows that increasing the explosion energy , like decreasing the mass , lets the gamma rays power the lc earlier and lets the gamma rays escape at later times , so the lc falls below the instantaneous co slope .",
    "again the affects of increasing the energy are not as dramatic as lowering the h mass by the same factor .      in brief",
    ":    * extensive @xmath1ni mixing causes the ni heating to be seen only slightly earlier and the plateau to be slightly brighter * confining the @xmath1ni delays and enhances the heating when the photosphere reaches the ni - powered diffusion wave ( ni bubble ) * larger @xmath1ni mixing causes only a slightly steeper radioactive tail    the general trends found when the ni is mixed further out in the ejecta the earlier the affects of the gamma rays are seen and at late times the slope of the tail becomes steeper .",
    "however the affects of ni mixing are not as dramatic as varying the other parameters .",

    "the model with the greatest ni mixing ( 11 m@xmath6 ) has a lc that becomes brighter earlier , by about 20 days , than the other two less mixed models .",
    "this is expected since the photosphere will encounter the gamma - ray heated material faster in the model with greater ni mixing .",
    "+ the more mixed models have a brighter and slightly broader plateau due to a combination of two things . at earlier times",
    "the plateau is brighter because more gamma - ray energy depostions can heat the material nearer to the photosphere adding to the luminosity . secondly gamma - ray deposited energy outside the photosphere adds directly to the luminosity .",
    "the photospheric temperature of the more mixed models is larger but not enough to account for the difference in brightness on the plateau , thus the additional luminosity is due to gamma ray deposition outside the photosphere .",
    "the secondary peak becomes broader as the ni mixing is more confined to the central region .",
    "this is due to the slow diffusion of material being heated by the gamma rays , the ni bubble or ni - powered diffusion wave .",
    "the photosphere can be seen to increase in temperature as the rw reaches the ni bubble in figure 13b and is shown to be slightly earlier for more mixed models . for the more mixed model this produces a wider plateau that merges with the secondary peak . for the least mixed model the plateau ends earlier and",
    "produces a dip in the light curve , resulting in a more defined secondary peak ( figs .",

    "14a , 14c , 14d ) show very little difference for all models out to 400 days .",
    "+ figure 15a shows that for a smaller ejected mass the ni mixing between the core ( dotted line ) and the envelope ( dashed line ) is not significant , which is expected since it is only a difference in mixing of 1 m@xmath6 .",
    "however the least mixed model ( solid line ) shows a dramatic early drop in luminosity with very little plateau . as the photosphere recedes into the he core material that has been heated by the trapped gamma rays it produces a secondary peak similar to sn 1987a . in the least mixed model since",
    "all the gamma rays are trapped the radioactive lc tail follows the instantaneous co decay slope .",
    "+ figure 15b shows that when the amount of ni is reduced the plateau drops earlier and the light curves look more similar to each other .",
    "compared to figure 13a the secondary peak arrives earlier , has a lower absolute magnitude and a shorter width . and",
    "as expected the difference in the tails is similar to figure 13a but scaled fainter .",
    "these light curves represent the most severe case of no affect on the lc .",
    "+ figure 15c shows that with an increased progenitor radius the mixing of ni has very little affect on any part of the light curve .",
    "+ figure 15d shows that when the explosion energy is increased the early lc become both more similar and brighter , and the tails tend to diverge only slightly more than figure 13a .",
    "this indicates that at higher energies ni mixing is even less important .",
    "a numerical parameter study of light curves showing the affects of five parameters representing the progenitor and explosion is carried out to 400 days . in this parameter study",
    "it is found that the early lc is affected by r , m , and e ; the plateau is affected by r , m , e , m@xmath51,and @xmath1ni mixing ; the secondary peak is affected by the r , m , e , m@xmath51 , and @xmath1ni mixing ; and the tail is affected by m , e , m@xmath51 , and @xmath1ni mixing .",

    "the ejected mass was determined a primary parameter since the ejected mass is thought to vary from 4 m@xmath6 to up 25 m@xmath6 and affects on the light curve sufficiently account for the observed lc variation .",
    "the explosion energy is taken as a secondary parameter since the explosion mechanism is not well determined and is thought to span a smaller range in parameter space for normal type iis , from 0.5 to 2@xmath7 ergs . + it is possible that a given lc is not unique since many variables affect the shape and absolute magnitude of the light curve",
    ". however it is more plausible to say that there is a small range in parameter space where the lc is not unique .",
    "it is then necessary to look at the entire lc ( out to 400 days or later ) in order to determine accurate values of the parameters .",
    "it is also beneficial to have a consistent model by fitting the spectrum in conjunction with the light curve , similar to the analysis of sn 1997d by @xcite .",
    "+ the progenitor radius has the largest affect on the early lc but it was also varied by the largest factor , 100 compared to a factor of 3 for the explosion energy .",
    "the radius is the one parameter that can reasonably explain the range in peak absolute magnitudes of the light curve .",
    "+ the conspicuous secondary peak found in almost all light curves just after or in place of the plateau is due to the recombination wave moving quickly through the compositionally unmixed he core and reaching the area where gamma - ray energy was deposited .",
    "+ the influence of @xmath1ni becomes increasingly important for stars with smaller radii and smaller ejected mass or larger explosion energy .",
    "but @xmath1ni has its most significant affect on a smaller radius as demonstrated with sn 1987a .",
    "thus as the progenitor radius is decreased the plateau and secondary peak become powered by the deposition of gamma rays .",
    "the affect of ni mixing on the light curve can dissapear if the progenitor radius is large or the amount of ni in the ejecta is very small .",
    "+ the variation of ejected mass does not necessarily show inverse affects when compared to changing the explosion energy .",
    "this is especially true for the plateaus , secondary peaks , and tails .",
    "it is shown that changing the h envelope mass causes differences in the density and velocity profiles that change the light curve more dramatically than the explosion energy .",
