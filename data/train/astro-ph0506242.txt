    "the conditions in the inner 3pc of the galaxy are set in large part by the complex interaction of over a dozen strong wolf - rayet star winds and the enveloping @xmath12  km  s@xmath1 giant molecular cloud ( m-0.02 - 0.07 ) , combined with the strong gravitational pull of the central supermassive black hole ( sgr  a * ) ( see melia & falcke 2001 for a recent review ) .",
    "the large number of massive stars in this compact region suggests an additional influence  that of supernova explosions .",
    "sgr  a east is the remnant of such an event .",
    "an earlier consideration of its interaction with the molecular cloud , based on the energetics and time required to carve out the central cavity now occupied by sgr  a east @xcite , pointed to an unusually powerful explosion , with an energy of @xmath13 ergs or greater , and a remnant age exceeding @xmath14 years .",
    "these estimates , however , ignored the importance of the stellar winds in clearing out the medium into which the supernova ejecta expanded following the incipient event . @xcite",
    "have shown with detailed 3d hydrodynamic simulations that , when one takes this additional factor into account , the current morphology of sgr  a east is actually consistent with a normal supernova explosion energy ( @xmath15 ergs ) .",
    "in addition , the relatively low gas density in the wind - filled region and the consequent more rapid expansion of the remnant into the surrounding medium leads to an inferred age much younger than @xmath16 years , probably @xmath17 years .",
    "@xcite focused on the x - ray ridge to the ne of sgr  a * , formed by the interaction of the stellar winds  which emanate from within the cavity enclosed by the circumnuclear disk ( cnd)and the slowing supernova ejecta expanding away from the site of the explosion that produced sgr  a east . in this paper , we discuss several additional features that have emerged from our simulations , along with other important implications of a young supernova remnant .",
    "these include the remnant s evolution , its impact on the supermassive black hole s accretion , and the spatial distribution of heavy elements formed in the supernova progenitor .",
    "in particular , we wish to examine the consequences of a young supernova remnant colliding with the 50  km  s@xmath1 cloud , focusing on the x - ray illumination this would have produced on extended objects , such as the molecular cloud sgr  b2 , @xmath18 light years to the ne of sgr  a*. sgr  b2 s current emission of a strongly - fluoresced fe line appears to be the x - ray `` echo '' of that interaction , providing the best ( circumstantial ) evidence of the impact the supernova would have had on the galactic center in the past several hundred years .",
    "we begin by describing the current observational status of sgr  b2 (    2 ) and then take a step back to discuss the basic principles of shock expansion in the galactic center (   3 ) . using a combination of 3-dimensional and 1-dimensional simulations , we then show how the supernova shock would have affected the accretion rate onto sgr  a * (   4 ) and the concurrent evolution of the supernova remnant sgr  a east (   5 ) , focusing on how these interactions might have accounted for the irradiation of sgr  b2 .",
    "we also present abundance distributions produced by the explosion (   6 ) which , if measured , could provide us with much tighter constraints on the supernova explosion energy",
    ". finally , we return to sgr  b2 and conclude with a possible explanation for the origin of the illumination that produced the current fluorescent fe emission .",
    "the region within @xmath19 pc of sgr  a * contains giant molecular clouds with a mean number density @xmath20 @xmath21 and a gas temperature on the order of @xmath22 k @xcite . over the past decade , several instruments , including asca @xcite and _",
    "beppo_sax @xcite , have revealed a source of bright fluorescent fe k@xmath23 line radiation within the cloud sgr  b2 ; several other smaller clouds also exhibit strong @xmath24 kev line emission , though with low absolute fluxes compared to sgr  b2 .",
    "the latter has a radius @xmath25@xmath26 pc and a total enclosed mass @xmath27@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "all of these fluorescing clouds produce a @xmath24 kev line with an unusually large equivalent width ( ew @xmath291@xmath30 kev ) , though sgr  b2 stands out with the largest width , at @xmath31@xmath32 kev .",
    "the surrounding continuum is quite flat , and shows strong absorption below @xmath33  kev and a sharp fe k@xmath23 absorption feature at @xmath34  kev .",
    "the large ew is a strong indicator of how this fluorescent emission is produced @xcite .",
    "a cloud radiates via x - ray fluorescence when it is illuminated , either internally or externally , by an x - ray source .",
    "however , a steady source embedded within the cloud produces an upper limit to the ew of only @xmath35 kev ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , regardless of how one chooses the parameters .",
    "the smaller molecular clouds might therefore be marginally consistent with an internal illuminator ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , sgr  b2 must necessarily be illuminated either by a time - dependent internal source whose flux has diminished , or by an external source . in the former case",
    ", the continuum will have faded away relative to the line intensity ; in the latter , we are not directly observing the full ionizing flux . in both cases ,",
    "the equivalent width would be larger than in a situation where the continuum spectrum of the irradiating source is still visible .",
    "recently , @xcite have reported an association of the hard x - ray source igr j17475 - 2822 with sgr  b2 , showing that the asca ( @xmath32@xmath36 kev ) and integral / ibis ( @xmath26@xmath37 kev ) spectral components match very well .",
    "they showed that the combined spectrum at @xmath32@xmath38 kev can be well fit by a model in which x - rays from an external source , possibly at the location of sgr  a * , are scattered and reprocessed by a homogeneous spherical cloud of cold , molecular hydrogen and helium gas , with iron abundance @xmath39 times solar .",
    "the possible identification of sgr  a * as the external illuminator of sgr  b2 would provide some measure of its recent variability at x - ray energies .",
    "this association is motivated in part by the fact that the iron emission in sgr  b2 is strongest on the side of the cloud facing sgr  a * @xcite .",
    "we may be witnessing the x - ray echo , delayed by 300400 years relative to the direct signal from the black hole , due to the light travel time from the galactic center out to sgr  b2 s position . in this scenario ,",
    "the fluorescent fe emission would then be direct evidence of the black hole s enhanced x - ray emissivity some @xmath40 years ago .",
    "alternative scenarios seem to be falling out of favor ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , although the time - dependent internal irradiator model can match the fe line shape as well as the external irradiator @xcite , the lack of any significant variation in the line flux with the passage of time argues against this geometry .",
    "the large ew of the @xmath24 kev line implies that the primary source should have faded away before the asca observation of 1993 .",
    "but the light crossing time of the sgr  b2 cloud is @xmath41@xmath22 years , so one might have expected to see a detectable decline of the @xmath24 kev line flux in the 7 years between the asca and _ beppo_sax observations , unless the irradiation of sgr  b2 is still ongoing because not all the x - ray waves have yet reached the cloud .",
    "though it is very tempting to invoke sgr  a * as the external illuminator , there are several reasons for taking a cautious view of this picture .",
    "chief among them is the fact that this scenario would require a change in the black hole s",
    "@xmath11 kev x - ray luminosity by a factor of @xmath42 in only @xmath40 years , from @xmath43 erg s@xmath1 @xcite to the currently observed value of @xmath44 erg s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "one of the principal goals of this paper is to examine the role played by the recent galactic center supernova in illuminating sgr  b2 , which may alleviate the difficulties described above .",
    "molecular cloud remnants , inflowing plumes , and hot ionized bubbles all combine to form a complex density structure across the galactic center , rendering it inappropriate for the `` spherically symmetric cow '' approach preferred by most theorists .",
    "these deviations from isotropy are well - reflected in the anisotropic propagation of the supernova shock .",
    "figure  [ fig:3ddens ] shows the initial 3-dimensional density structure used in our simulations .",
    "we have here made the same model assumptions as @xcite , in which the density profile is determined solely by the mass - losing stars interacting with the dense circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) within the gravitational potential of the central supermassive black hole .",
    "we have also assumed that the stellar wind ejecta have not changed significantly in the past @xmath45@xmath16 years .",
    "figure  [ fig:2ddens ] shows a 0.2pc slice of this density structure centered on sgr  a * at the time of the explosion .    before we discuss the propagation of the shock through this complex density distribution , we review the spherically symmetric picture and consider the 3 basic evolutionary phases of supernova remnants and their shocks @xcite :    * phase i ( free - streaming ) : the supernova explosion initially propagates essentially unimpeded by the surrounding medium .",
    "this phase ends roughly when the supernova has swept up a mass equal to the pre - explosion mass of the progenitor . *",
    "phase ii ( adiabatic ) : the remnant evolves into a second phase where cooling is still not important .",
    "the shock can be described using adiabatic , self - similar blast wave solutions @xcite .",
    "* phase iii ( snow - plow ) : the final phase occurs when radiative cooling becomes important . in this phase , the thermal energy of the shock is rapidly radiated and the shock moves forward by momentum conservation alone .",
    "this phase ends when the velocity of the shock decreases below the sound speed of the surrounding medium .    for a 15@xmath46 star ,",
    "the end of the free - streaming phase ( @xmath47 ) , and the remnant s radial extent ( @xmath48 ) at that time , are given , respectively , by the expressions @xmath49 and @xmath50 as functions of supernova explosion energy @xmath51 ( in units of @xmath52ergs ) and density of the surrounding medium @xmath53 ( in units of @xmath21 ) .",
    "here we have assumed that the velocity is @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the supernova energy and mass , respectively ) which , however , underestimates the lead shock speed .",
    "we can use these spherical estimates , combined with the density structure at the galactic center ( figure  [ fig:2ddens ] ) , to follow the free - streaming phase along specific paths .",
    "that portion of the supernova shock that moves away from sgr  a * ( where the number density is low : @xmath35 @xmath21 ) does not decelerate significantly until it hits the 50 km s@xmath1 molecular cloud that surrounds the galactic center ( roughly 4pc from the launch site of the supernova ) .",
    "but the ejecta moving toward sgr  a * propagate through an increasingly dense medium .",
    "the remnant on this side of the explosion leaves the free - streaming phase more than 0.5pc away from sgr  a*.    beyond the free - streaming phase , but before radiative cooling becomes important , the shock propagates adiabatically .",
    "this phase lasts for a period set by the cooling time of the shock .",
    "@xcite estimated the radial and temporal extent of the shock for different cooling functions .",
    "when lines dominate , they find @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the number density in units of @xmath60 @xmath21 . for the segment of the shock directed toward the galactic center , where densities are in the range of @xmath61 @xmath21 , the shock travels less than @xmath62 pc before cooling takes over . from these rough calculations",
    ", we might therefore expect the shock to just reach sgr  a*. however , as we shall see in   4",
    ", the fact that the shock can flow around this dense region , made impenetrable by the persistent outward ram pressure of the stellar winds , means that the shock actually never reaches the galactic center .",
    "correspondingly , the ejecta moving away from the galactic center have a much more extended adiabatic phase ; it lasts until they hit the molecular cloud , at which point the phase ends almost immediately .",
    "timing is also important .",
    "the total travel time for the ejecta to reach the nucleus is just 600 years .",
    "if the molecular cloud is 4 pc away from the explosion site , our rough velocity estimate leads to the shock leaving the adiabatic phase at roughly 1600 years .",
    "let us now compare these results to the actual numerical calculations .",
    "we use both 1-dimensional and fully 3-dimensional simulations to trace the evolution of the supernova remnant and to provide us with a basic understanding of its effect on the galactic center .",
    "of course , in the 1-dimensional case , we model the properties of the medium into which the shock front expands in an angle - averaged sense . under the assumption of spherical symmetry , we have found that the shock passes through both its free - streaming and adiabatic phases prior to reaching sgr  a * , but that it is less clear whether or not the shock actually reaches sgr  a * before cooling and assimilating into its surroundings .",
    "what these spherically - symmetric simulations do not include are multi - dimensional geometric effects .",
    "just as an ocean wave flows around a rocky promontory , the supernova shock will flow around the dense stellar - wind - filled region surrounding sgr  a*. using the snsph code described in @xcite , we have modeled the propagation of the supernova through the inner 3pc region surrounding the galactic nucleus ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "the density profile was taken from @xcite and the supernova was assumed to occur with an energy of @xmath63ergs , in a progenitor with a mass of 15@xmath64 @xcite .",
    "we placed it at longitude = @xmath65  pc and latitude = @xmath66  pc relative to sgr  a * in galactic coordinates , or @xmath30  pc due east of sgr  a * in right ascension ( but at the same radial distance from us ) .",
    "we have also modeled a more energetic explosion ( @xmath67erg ) by artificially increasing the velocity of the ejecta by a factor 3 ; table  [ table : sims ] summarizes the properties of both simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : normaltime ] shows a series of snapshots recording the temporal evolution of the supernova explosion and the resulting remnant from our 3-dimensional ( @xmath68erg ) simulation .",
    "the contours indicate regions with different densities , while the vectors highlight the supernova shock ; the dark vectors correspond to the supernova ejecta themselves and the light vectors indicate shocked wind material .",
    "the shock collides with and flows around the inner 0.4pc region primarily along paths of lowest density .",
    "it ultimately clears out much of the inner 3pc region , except for those portions shadowed by the cnd or by the outflowing winds from the central 0.4pc . the depth to which our simulated shock penetrates in the direction of sgr  a * may be checked by simply comparing the ram pressure of the supernova shock with that of the winds . at 430 years",
    ", the shock is within @xmath69 pc of the black hole .",
    "the density and velocity of the shock are roughly 3 particles @xmath21 and 4,000 kms@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding values for the wind outflow are 100 particles @xmath21 and 700 kms@xmath1 . the energy density ( or equivalently",
    ", the ram pressure , @xmath70 ) of one flow is equal to that of the opposing flow , and neither makes headway .",
    "this roughly marks the time of maximum penetration of the supernova shock , which eventually flows around the central region . by 1,400 years after the explosion",
    ", the ram pressure of the supernova shock decreases below that of the wind , and the latter begins to reassert itself .    in the @xmath13 erg simulation ( shown in figure  [ fig : energtime ] in a similar series of snapshots )",
    ", the shock moves much faster and penetrates deeper into the stellar wind region surrounding sgr  a*. by 170 years , the shock is within 0.2pc of the black hole , but as in the standard - energy simulation the shock flows around the dense central region , and even at the distance of closest approach  roughly 270 years after the explosion  the supernova shock never gets closer than 0.1pc from sgr  a*. after 1,200 years , the shock has swept through the entire 3 pc central region , clearing out most of the material except for the cnd and the stellar winds , which have begun to reassert themselves beyond 0.4 pc .    even though the shock does nt actually reach sgr  a *",
    ", it can still affect the medium there , and possibly alter the rate at which matter ( and its angular momentum ) is accreted onto the black hole .",
    "figure  [ fig : mdot ] shows the accretion rate and accreted specific angular momentum as a function of time for both simulations .",
    "even the high - energy simulation exhibits an increase in accretion rate of less than a factor 2 around the time of closest approach of the supernova shock to the black hole ; the standard - energy simulation shows an increase of only @xmath71% .",
    "the accreted specific angular momentum shows similar variation ; the specific angular momentum accreted in the high - energy simulation jumps by more than a factor 2 for a short period , but the normal - energy simulation shows almost no change at all .    in summary ,",
    "our simulations demonstrate that even with a @xmath72erg explosion , a supernova ( or `` hypernova '' , as these rare energetic explosions are often called ) does not penetrate all the way to sgr  a * and does not significantly alter the accretion rate .",
    "it is difficult to imagine any scenario in which such minor changes in the accretion rate can result in a brightening of sgr  a * by a factor of a million , allowing it to be the transient irradiator of sgr  b2 several hundred years ago .",
    "if sgr  b2 was indeed illuminated by emission at the galactic center , the source of those x - rays must lie beyond sgr  a*.",
    "as the supernova shock moves outward , it ultimately hits the 50 km s@xmath1 molecular cloud behind and to the east of sgr  a*. the last vestige of this interaction is visible now as sgr  a east .",
    "however , the dense molecular cloud lies well outside the simulation space of our 3-dimensional calculations .",
    "currently , the inclusion of such a large volume , with the spatial resolution we need in order to produce images such as those shown in earlier figures , is beyond our present computational capability in 3 dimensions .    in this section ,",
    "we examine the evolution of sgr  a east , focusing on its viability to act as a source for the past illumination of sgr  b2 .",
    "to do so , we employ a simplified version of the 1-dimensional lagrangian code developed by @xcite .",
    "we include in this code an approximate cooling term , using mean values of the cooling function given in @xcite .",
    "we vary the magnitude of this energy loss rate and find , within the range of values given by our temperatures , that the exact value of the cooling rate does not affect our results considerably .",
    "what is important , however , is the density profile of the medium through which the shock is propagating .    in their detailed study of molecular gas in the central @xmath36 parsecs of the galaxy",
    ", @xcite examined the interaction between the sgr  a east shell and the 50 km s@xmath1 cloud and concluded that the expansion of the former apparently did not move a significant amount of the latter s mass .",
    "this is consistent with the results of our simulation , in which the supernova ejecta at first moved rather quickly through the medium surrounding sgr  a * , which had been mostly cleared out by the powerful winds of stars situated within @xmath73 parsecs of the black hole .",
    "but sgr  a east is clearly interacting with the 50  km  s@xmath1 cloud now , as evidenced by the presence of seven 1720 mhz oh maser emission regions within several arcmins of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "this transition of the oh molecule is a powerful shock diagnostic and is collisionally pumped by h2 molecules at the site where c - type supernova shocks drive into adjacent molecular clouds .",
    "most of these maser spots are located to the se of sgr  a * , at the boundary of sgr  a east and m-0.02 - 0.07 .",
    "in addition , zeeman splitting measurements suggest that the magnetic field at these locations is of order @xmath74 mg .",
    "both the relatively high intensity of this field , and the intense oh maser emission , indicate that the shock at the interface between sgr  a east and m-0.02 - 0.07 must be very strong , since the impact is compressing the gas and the field lines .",
    "the present interaction region between sgr  a east and m-0.02 - 0.07 appears to be @xmath75 in projection from sgr  a * @xcite . at the distance to the galactic center",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath76 parsecs ; taking projection into account , we infer @xmath77 parsecs as a reasonable estimate of the distance between the interaction site and sgr  a*. thus , with our chosen supernova site 2 parsecs due east ( in right ascension ) of sgr  a * , it would have taken @xmath78 years for the shock front to reach the molecular cloud traveling at a speed of @xmath79 km s@xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ fig:1dvel ] shows several snapshots in time of the velocity of propagation for three 1-dimensional explosion calculations .",
    "the basic setup of these models is a diffuse ( @xmath80 @xmath21 ) wind - swept region with an outer dense ( @xmath81 @xmath21 ) molecular cloud , roughly starting at 4pc . as we would expect from the sedov blast wave similarity solution @xcite , the shock decelerates as it propagates through the diffuse wind - swept medium .",
    "if the diffuse density were higher , the shock would decelerate faster and reach the molecular cloud at a later time .",
    "if the explosion energy were higher , the shock would move faster and hence reach the molecular cloud earlier . in all cases ,",
    "the shock essentially hits a wall at the molecular cloud and bounces back , sending a reverse shock through the diffuse , lower density region .",
    "the energy dissipated when the shock interacts with the molecular cloud can be a significant , albeit transitory , source of high - energy radiation .",
    "supernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds are efficient electron accelerators and sources of hard x - ray and @xmath82-ray emission @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum of the nonthermal electrons is shaped by various processes , including first and second - order fermi acceleration in a turbulent plasma , and energy losses due to coulomb , bremsstrahlung , synchrotron , and inverse compton interactions .",
    "the spectrum produced by these particles between @xmath35 kev and @xmath35 mev is essentially a power law , @xmath83 , with @xmath84 .",
    "the efficiency of energy transfer from the shock flow to the nonthermal electrons is roughly @xmath85 , though the actual value depends on the velocity of the shock , the density in the cloud , and the radiative efficiency ; the efficiency may be lower , but under some conditions , it could be as much as a factor of 2 greater . since the detailed calculation of the particle acceleration and radiation is beyond the scope of the present paper , we will here simply adopt @xmath85 efficiency as the fiducial value , and calculate the overall x - ray/@xmath82-ray luminosity from the sgr  a east / m-0.02 - 0.07 interaction site by estimating the shock energy dissipation rate from our 1-dimensional simulation , and assuming that all of the nonthermal particle energy is eventually radiated .",
    "we note that with our simplified 1-dimensional simulations , the reverse shock ultimately produces many regions of compression , bouncing backwards and forwards . however , these subsequent shocks are unlikely to be as strong as the first in the aspherical geometry of the galactic center . here",
    ", we focus only on the energetics of the first ( or leading ) impact .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath38 kev luminosity resulting from the interaction we are simulating here is shown as a function of time in figure  [ fig:1dlum ] .",
    "this light curve is calculated with the conservative assumption , described above , that only 5% of the dissipated energy in the leading shock is converted into photons above @xmath30 kev . since the 50 km s@xmath1 molecular cloud",
    "does not completely envelop the galactic center , we also assume that the interaction site occupies only @xmath86 of solid angle ; this estimate is , of course , only a rough approximation , but it does not significantly impact our conclusion .    the result shown in figure  [ fig:1dlum ] clearly establishes the possibility that the interaction between the supernova that created sgr  a east , and the giant molecular cloud , produced the transient x - ray flux whose echo we see today in the fe fluorescence of sgr  b2 .",
    "this conclusion comes with several caveats , however , mostly having to do with uncertainties in the overall irradiating luminosity : first , recall that the shock will bounce off of the molecular cloud and send a reverse shock back through the outflowing ejecta , causing the total @xmath87 kev emissivity to be higher than the value we have calculated here ; this is potentially good for the model .",
    "second , when we allow for additional dimensions in the calculation , the shock may flow around the molecular cloud , so the shock in sgr  a east may not be as strong as we find in our 1-dimensional simulation ; of course , this will lower the yield of nonthermal particles , and hence the @xmath8 kev luminosity . which of these factors wins out",
    "may ultimately determine whether or not this model is correct .",
    "given the level of sophistication of our current calculations , we can only say that both the luminosity and the timing associated with the peak of the dissipation seem to be those required to account for the properties of sgr  b2 .",
    "our calculation shows that within the last @xmath88 years , over @xmath89 erg s@xmath1 were released in photons with energy above 2 kev .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present paper to calculate in detail the spectrum of the irradiating flux , but we note from the work of @xcite that the radiation produced by the nonthermal particles is essentially a power law with flux @xmath90 .",
    "thus , the integrated luminosity in the @xmath11 kev range should be @xmath91 of the total .",
    "with reference to _",
    "chandra s _ spectral band , our predicted x - ray flux is therefore roughly 1/5th the value shown in figure  [ fig:1dlum ] .",
    "given that the peak irradiance occurred @xmath92 years ago , the @xmath11 kev flux level now is therefore consistent with _",
    "chandra s _ current measured x - ray luminosity of @xmath10 ergs s@xmath1 from the sgr  a east / molecular cloud interaction region . and",
    "since our calculated light curve is also a good match to the required illumination of sgr  b2 by a @xmath93 kev spectrum with a peak luminosity of @xmath94 ergs s@xmath1 some @xmath95 years ago @xcite , we see that both the temporal variation of the high - energy flux , and its associated spectrum , are consistent with all the currently available data .",
    "two uncertainties dominate our solution of the sgr  b2 illumination problem : the supernova explosion itself and the environment through which the explosion travelled .",
    "understanding the environment requires first trying to get a full 3-dimensional structure from observations and then extrapolating that structure backward in time ( a process that also requires knowledge of the supernova explosion and its progenitor star ) . here",
    ", we will instead focus on possible observations that can help constrain the supernova explosion only .",
    "in particular , we would like to study the issue of the supernova remnant s age and related issues concerning the origin of the explosion and its energy .",
    "@xcite found that the structure of the x - ray ridge and its x - ray flux constrained the remnant s age .",
    "they assumed a roughly  standard \" ( @xmath96erg ) explosion , a radial position of the origin of the supernova set to the radial position of sgr  a * , and a central region whose structure is dominated by the interaction of the stellar winds with the cnd and a central supermassive black hole . in this paper , we have expanded this study to include a much more energetic @xmath67erg explosion . by carrying out a similar study of the x - ray luminosity and shape of the x - ray ridge",
    ", we estimate the age of the remnant produced by the strong explosion to be 700y . it may be difficult to explain the current luminosity of sgr a east with such a young , strong supernova explosion .",
    "clearly , the remnant s age corresponding to either explosion energy is much less than previously thought .",
    "but can we place an upper limit on this age ?",
    "figure  [ fig:3dlum ] shows the 2 - 10kev luminosity of the x - ray ridge .",
    "observations of this ridge can be fit with a two - component model to its luminosity : a 1kev component with a flux of @xmath97  erg  @xmath98  s@xmath1 , and a 5.6kev component with a flux of @xmath99  erg  @xmath98  s@xmath1 ; these fluxes translate to luminosities of @xmath100  erg  s@xmath1 and @xmath101  erg  s@xmath1 , respectively , assuming a distance of @xmath102  kpc to the galactic center .",
    "if we assume that only the 5.6kev component is actually associated with the interaction that produces the ridge , we find that the standard simulation matches this luminosity at @xmath3  y ; the energetic simulation matches it at @xmath103  y. a factor 2 uncertainty in the flux would place an upper age limit at @xmath104  y for the standard explosion and at @xmath105  y for the energetic event .",
    "such a short remnant age has serious implications on the chemical enrichment from this supernova .",
    "the @xmath106ni ( which decays into the main iron products of the supernova ) is produced only in the inner layers of the star .",
    "the explosion quickly develops into a homologous expansion ( meaning that the ejecta velocity is proportional to the radius ) ; the iron , produced in the inner layers of the ejecta , is moving slowly . in our standard explosion , it is never moving faster than about 2000kms@xmath1 ( in contrast , the highest velocity in the energetic explosion is roughly 6000kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "if the iron moved at this high velocity without decelerating , our standard - energy supernova would not enrich regions in the galactic center beyond 3.6pc , but because the iron does decelerate ( along with the rest of the shock ) , this number is closer to 2pc ( figure  [ fig:3dabund ] ) . in the energetic explosion , the iron travels faster and penetrates farther into the galactic center medium .",
    "indeed , the intermediate weight elements ( e.g. silicon and magnesium ) have traveled beyond our computational grid boundaries . from figure  [ fig:3dabund ]",
    ", we see that elements made near the iron layer are , like the iron , limited to a reduced region around the origin of the supernova ; elements made further out in the star extend much farther into the surrounding region .",
    "in addition , there is a zone shadowed by the stellar winds around sgr  a * that is not enriched at all by the supernova .",
    "there are two major caveats to these abundance plots .",
    "first , we have assumed a spherically symmetric explosion and subsequent expansion .",
    "but we now know that core - collapse supernovae are far from symmetric ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "asymmetries in the explosion will allow some iron to mix much further out in the star , and due to the homologous outflow , achieve higher velocities . however , the bulk of the iron will not reach velocities significantly different from what we have obtained in our spherical models .",
    "we also did not incorporate into our energetic event the greater yield of heavy elements in a stronger explosion @xcite .",
    "the more energetic event could produce a factor 2 more iron , and 10 times more @xmath107ti , but the basic distribution would remain the same .",
    "the x - ray ridge observations push for a young supernova remnant . using the x - ray ridge ages",
    ", we expect the iron to still be close to the origin of the supernova explosion ( further out for the strong explosion than for the weak explosion ) .",
    "if the remnant truly is 5,000 - 10,000y old , the iron should be well mixed all the way into sgr a*. high resolution abundance maps could both confirm or cast - into - doubt the young age predicted by the x - ray ridge .",
    "in addition , such maps could help locate the origin of the explosion .",
    "combined with better models of sgr a east , such information will also constrain the supernova energy .",
    "one way to get this information is to look for evidence of compositional variation in the dust grains and molecular gas in the denser regions : e.g. , in the cnd , the northern ridge , or the western streamer @xcite .",
    "depending on the supernova energy , age , and location , one or more of these dense regions may be enriched by metals from the supernova itself . for the standard supernova explosion simulation ,",
    "we expect only the cnd to be enriched by iron or even silicon .",
    "since elements like silicon and magnesium are primarily tied up in dust grains , depending sensitively on the physical conditions , accurate abundance measurements may be difficult to obtain .",
    "emission from radioactive elements is less sensitive to the physical conditions and could also provide some clues .",
    "the major intermediate age elements are @xmath107ti and @xmath108ni .",
    "unfortunately , for the standard supernova explosion energy , the age of the remnant is so much larger than the @xmath109y half - life of @xmath107ti , that the resultant high energy flux from its decay is 10 million times fainter than that of 1987a ( for the energetic explosion with its likely higher @xmath107ti yield and younger age , this value is still a million times fainter than 1987a ) .",
    "this is well beyond any detection limit .",
    "however , the @xmath108ni flux ( with its 75,000year lifetime ) could be as high as @xmath110 ( possibly even higher for the energetic explosion ) .",
    "although beyond detectable limits of current instruments @xcite , this flux may be observed with an improved generation of high - energy telescopes .",
    "none of these observational constraints are easy to obtain .",
    "we provide this information to encourage and justify experimental and observational programs that might be able to shed more light on this complex problem .",
    "the fact that sgr  a east had little impact on sgr  a * s accretion rate as the remnant passed across the galactic center is of some consequence to the question of how sgr  b2 and other nearby molecular clouds produce their strong fluorescent fe line emission at @xmath24 kev .",
    "this puzzle has been viewed as an important indicator of past high - energy activity at the galactic center , though with very little guidance from gas dynamic studies  until now .",
    "this is where our results from the 3-dimensional and 1-dimensional simulations enter the discussion .",
    "one might have thought that the passage of the supernova remnant s front across sgr  a * could have triggered a significant increase in the rate of gas infall , possibly even producing an enhanced accretion rate onto the black hole to fuel its @xmath42 factor increase in x - ray luminosity .",
    "the implication of this model would be that the supernova shock passed through the galactic center some @xmath95 years ago .",
    "as we have seen , however , the gas dynamics within the inner @xmath111 parsecs of the galaxy negate this possibility , because the strong , cumulative outflux of matter from the interior of the cnd prevents sgr  a east from penetrating closer than @xmath112 parsecs from sgr  a*. at best , the black hole s accretion rate could have increased by possibly @xmath113 , far short of the value required to account for the irradiation of sgr  b2 .    instead",
    ", our modeling of sgr  a east s interaction with the galactic center has produced what we believe is a far more plausible scenario for the variable illumination of sgr  b2 several hundred years ago . as we saw earlier , the remnant s shock front apparently reached the galactic center some 160 years after the supernova explosion , and swept around the inner @xmath114 parsec region in @xmath115 years .",
    "our modeling of the x - ray ridge ne of sgr  a * suggests that we are viewing the interaction between the remnant and the winds flowing out from the ionized cavity @xmath3 years after the supernova event .",
    "there is strong observational evidence that sgr  a east is now also interacting with the so - called 50 km s@xmath1 molecular cloud behind sgr  a * @xcite .",
    "but this interaction should have produced an intense x - ray/@xmath82-ray glow when the impact first occurred , due to the initial rapid dissipation of kinetic energy flux into heat , nonthermal particle acceleration and radiation .",
    "given the proximity of the supernova event site to the galactic center ( only several parsecs away from sgr  a * ) , the ensuing irradiation of sgr  b2 would still show the tell - tale characteristics of a galactic center source , albeit now a diffuse x - ray/@xmath82-ray emitter , rather than a point source associated directly with sgr  a*. the key constraint is that sgr  a east s x - ray/@xmath82-ray glow should not have ended more than @xmath92 years ago  approximately @xmath116 years after the supernova explosion  this being the light travel time between the interaction site and sgr  b2 .",
    "there may even be related evidence that the x - ray/@xmath82-ray glow may have persisted closer to the present time , perhaps to within the past 100 or 200 hundred years . in their analysis of sgr  a east and its x - ray properties",
    ", @xcite showed that the ionized gas halo into which sgr  a east is currently expanding ( i.e. , in regions other than where it is colliding with the 50 km / s cloud ) may have been ionized by the same irradiator that produced the current fluorescence in sgr  b2 .",
    "for an ambient gas density @xmath117 @xmath21 , the required luminosity would have been @xmath118 ergs s@xmath1 , but since the recombination time in such a gas is shorter than @xmath18 years , the ( still ) high ionization fraction in the ism argues for a period of irradiation extending to well within 300 years of the present .",
    "however , the current x - ray luminosity from the sgr  a east shell , including the region of interaction with the 50 km / s cloud , places a rather severe constraint on how rapidly the x - ray/@xmath82 ray glow must have subsided to its present value .",
    "this @xmath11 kev limit is @xmath119 ergs s@xmath1 , if we take the whole shell into account .",
    "a reduction in the solid angle subtended by the interaction zone at the site of the explosion would lower this level even further .    the circumstantial evidence for a youthful sgr  a east remnant is building .",
    "we now have several observational indicators that self - consistently point to the explosion occurring not more than @xmath120 years ago .",
    "these include the current morphology and x - ray luminosity of the ridge , the diffuse x - rays from the central @xmath121 parsecs , which apparently point to stellar winds as the sole contributors to the ism within the cavity , and the timing and @xmath8 kev luminosity associated with the remnant s interaction with the 50 km s@xmath1 molecular cloud , which apparently irradiated sgr  b2 and , possibly , the ionized halo surrounding the galactic center several hundred years ago .    on the theoretical plane , several additional steps remain to be taken .",
    "these include a more thorough examination of the nonthermal particle injection and radiation at the remnant - cloud interface , and a subsequent analysis of the time - dependent spectrum illuminating sgr  b2 and other nearby clouds .",
    "eventually , when the necessary computational resources become available , it would be very helpful to redo these calculations in 3 dimensions .",
    "observationally , this work would benefit from a high resolution mapping of the metal abundances surrounding the explosion site .",
    "the morphology of this distribution should be directly coupled to the energetics of the explosion and the age of the remnant .    *",
