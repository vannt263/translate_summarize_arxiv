    "<S> the nature of insulating phase in 5@xmath0 based sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 is quite debated as the theoretical as well as experimental investigations have put forward evidences in favor of both magnetically driven slater - type and interaction driven mott - type insulator . to understand this insulating behavior , </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated the nature of magnetic state in sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 through studying critical exponents , low temperature thermal demagnetization and magnetocaloric effect . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated critical exponents do not exactly match with any universality class , however , the values obey the scaling behavior . the exponent values suggest that spin interaction in present material is close to mean - field model . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of low temperature thermal demagnetization data , however , shows dual presence of localized- and itinerant - type of magnetic interaction . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , field dependent change in magnetic entropy indicates magnetic interaction is close to mean - field type . </S>",
    "<S> while this material shows an insulating behavior across the magnetic transition , yet a distinct change in slope in resistivity is observed around @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we infer that though the insulating phase in sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 more close to be slater - type but the simultaneous presence of both slater- and mott - type is the likely scenario for this material . </S>"
