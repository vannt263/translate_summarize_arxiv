    "due to their low production costs and easy processability organic semiconductor devices are promising materials for organic light emitting diodes ( oleds ) ,  @xcite organic field effect transistors ( ofets ) ,  @xcite radio frequency identification tags ( rfids )  @xcite and solar cells ,  @xcite to mention just a few .",
    "the performance of these devices depends crucially on the charge transport .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the basic principles of charge transport in these materials .",
    "various models have been proposed which are often contradictory .",
    "the band theory , which is well established for inorganic covalently bonded materials , is not particularly appropriate for organic conductors , because organic molecular crystals are only weakly bound by van der waals interactions causing the molecules to be much more flexible . due to the complex nodal structure of the molecular orbitals the transfer integrals between the monomers are very sensitive to even small nuclear displacements .",
    "that is why lattice vibrations play a more important role in organic than in inorganic materials , as they destroy the long range order and lead to a charge carrier localization .",
    "@xcite to account for these vibrations , a variety of models have been proposed which incorporate the local ( holstein )  @xcite and the nonlocal ( peierls )  @xcite coupling .",
    "the latter leads to a polaron model where the charge carrier is partially localized and dressed by phonons .",
    "@xcite the fluctuations of the coupling between the molecules are of the same order of magnitude as the average coupling ,  @xcite leading to a rather strong localization .",
    "other models have been suggested , where the charges are assumed to be localized and the inter- and intramolecular vibrations are treated classically .",
    "@xcite    at higher temperatures , it is often appropriate to assume that the charge is localized due to the thermal disorder of the molecules and that charge transport occurs via thermally activated hopping .",
    "@xcite in some cases room temperature should be sufficient for this assumption to be justified .",
    "we apply this hopping model to study the dependence of the charge carrier mobility on the molecular structure and morphology as well as its angular dependency .",
    "the latter point is important since most organic crystals show a pronounced anisotropy for the transport parameters which has to be taken into account for device design .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the mobility is very sensitive to the arrangement of the monomers and that already small changes in their alignment can alter the transport parameters dramatically .",
    "@xcite    a promising class of materials for organic electronics are perylene bisimides . due to their light resistance",
    "@xcite and intense photoluminescence  @xcite they are widely used as robust organic dyes in the automobile industry .",
    "@xcite furthermore , they show a considerable electron mobility  @xcite and a high electron affinity .",
    "@xcite that is why they serve as n - type semiconductors for organic field effect transistors  @xcite and as electron acceptor material in organic solar cells .",
    "@xcite    section  [ sec : theory ] describes the theoretical background of the applied model as well as details of the numerical calculations and computational approaches .",
    "it is shown that the master equation approach is particularly faster than the well - known monte carlo method .",
    "furthermore we elucidate why the commonly applied approach to calculate the mobility via the diffusion constant along with rate equations  @xcite is not appropriate in many important cases . in sec .",
    "[ sec : einstein ] we consider the frequently disputed question if the einstein relation holds even for more disordered ( amorphous ) materials .",
    "@xcite in sec .",
    "[ sec : anisotropy ] we show results for the orientational and morphological dependency of the mobility for pentacene , rubrene and two fluorinated perylene bisimides .",
    "the first two materials are experimentally and theoretically well investigated  @xcite which allows for the comparison with experimental data .",
    "in this work , a hopping mechanism is assumed for the motion of the charge carriers .",
    "the hopping rate from a site @xmath0 to @xmath1 is given by the marcus equation  @xcite @xmath2,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the electronic coupling parameter , @xmath4 is the reorganization energy , @xmath5 is the temperature , @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the planck constant .",
    "the energy difference @xmath9 between the two hopping sites is caused by an external electric field @xmath10 .",
    "if the material is less ordered or even amorphous , each molecule experiences slightly different surrounding effects ( such as polarization ) that lead to different site energies @xmath11 .",
    "these energy differences furthermore contribute to @xmath9 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the charge which equals the positive or negative unit charge and @xmath14 is the distance vector between sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "marcus rates have been used before for calculating the anisotropy of the charge carrier mobility ,  @xcite but with @xmath15 .    the interaction of the charge carriers with the phonons is partially considered by the reorganization energy . due to the weak van der waals interactions between organic molecules , it can be divided into an internal ( intramolecular ) and an external ( intermolecular ) part , i.e.@xmath16 .",
    "the intramolecular reorganization energy @xmath17 is due to the geometry changes of the donor and the acceptor monomer upon the charge transfer process .",
    "the external reorganization energy @xmath18 covers the energetic changes concerning the surrounding , caused by lattice distortion and polarization . for oligoacenes @xmath18",
    "was shown to be about one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite furthermore , is was demonstrated that @xmath17 of a molecule is lower in a cluster than in gas phase and that the total reorganization energy of naphthalene is closer to @xmath17 in the gas phase than to @xmath17 in the cluster .",
    "@xcite that is why the external reorganization energy is neglected in this paper and the internal reorganization energy of the monomer in vacuum is used for  @xmath4 .",
    "the marcus theory was originally derived for outer sphere electron transfer in solvents .",
    "@xcite it stems from time dependent perturbation theory ( fermi s golden rule ) and describes a non - adiabatic charge transfer where the charge carrier is localized at the donor or acceptor molecule respectively . treating the coupling as a perturbation requires that @xmath3 is small compared to @xmath19 , which corresponds to the activation energy for the charge carrier to change place ( for @xmath20 ) .",
    "furthermore , the thermal relaxation ( the geometric reorganization ) has to be fast in comparison with the transfer so that the system can be assumed to be in thermal equilibrium during the transfer .",
    "in addition , the theory is restricted to the high temperature case since tunneling is neglected completely and the molecular vibrations are treated classically , what requires @xmath21 .",
    "these restrictions of the marcus theory in the context of charge transport are discussed elsewhere .",
    "@xcite despite all imperfections it is widely used for charge transfer in organic crystals  @xcite and one can certainly assume that this theory is suitable for the purpose of a qualitative charge transport analysis .",
    "the master equation approach was used to describe the transport process . in the case of low charge carrier densities , the master equation , which describes the hopping of the charge carriers in the organic semiconductor , has the simple linear form  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the probability that the lattice site @xmath0 is occupied by a charge carrier .",
    "the index @xmath1 sums over all other sites . in principle",
    ", it is also possible to include repulsive forces between the charge carriers in the master equation in order to account for higher charge carrier densities .",

    "@xmath27 is @xmath29 the columns correspond to the initial sites @xmath0 of the charge carrier and the lines correspond to the final sites @xmath1 , i.e. , the jump rate @xmath28 from @xmath0 to @xmath1 appears in the @xmath0th column and the @xmath1th line .",
    "the diagonal elements contain the negative sum of all hopping rates away from the respective site .",
    "the infinite matrix @xmath27 is approximated by a finite matrix with cyclic boundary conditions , i.e. , a charge carrier that leaves the crystal at one side reenters at the opposite side .",
    "this means for the example matrix depicted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix ] ) that the charge which jumps from site 4 in positive direction ends at site 1 .",
    "for this boundary condition to be applicable it has to be assured that the hopping rate from site 4 to site 1 in negative direction is negligible .",

    "considerations similar to those above for the mobility seem to provide @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the spatial dimensionality .",

    "<S> the orientational dependence of charge carrier mobilities in organic semiconductor crystals and the correlation with the crystal structure are investigated by means of quantum chemical first principles calculations combined with a model using hopping rates from marcus theory . </S>",
    "<S> a master equation approach is presented which is numerically more efficient than the monte carlo method frequently applied in this context . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is shown that the widely used approach to calculate the mobility via the diffusion constant along with rate equations is not appropriate in many important cases . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are compared with experimental data , showing good qualitative agreement for pentacene and rubrene . in addition , charge transport properties of core - fluorinated perylene bisimides are investigated . </S>"
