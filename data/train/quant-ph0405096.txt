    "the quantification of entanglement in a multipartite quantum system is one of the most important and challenging topics of quantum information theory .",
    "the first attempt of measuring entanglement was based on the violation of the so called bell s inequalities @xcite .",
    "it was thought that the amount of non - classical correlations in a bipartite quantum system was intrinsically related to the level of violation of these family of inequalities .",
    "nonetheless , the generalization of such inequalities to multipartite states is not possible in general .",
    "furthermore , it was already shown that , even for the bipartite case , the chsh ( clauser - horne - shimony - holt ) form of bell s inequalities does not constitute a good measure of quantum correlations in the sense that there are states which do not violate it , but can be purified by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) to a state which does @xcite .",
    "therefore , different measures of entanglement were introduced based on the concept of asymptotic distillability @xcite .    for pure states ,",
    "the von neumann entropy @xcite of the reduced density matrix @xmath0 is exactly the number of bell states which can be asymptotically distilled by locc from @xmath1 .",
    "it satisfies all desired properties ( normalization , convexity , local unitary operations invariance , etc ... ) of an entanglement measure [ 6 ] .",
    "several attempts were made in order to generalize this measure ( the entropy entanglement - @xmath2 ) for mixed sates .",
    "the most successful are the entanglement cost ( @xmath3 ) , the entanglement of formation ( @xmath4 ) , the relative entropy of entanglement ( @xmath5 ) and the distillable entanglement @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "they all coincide with the entropy of entanglement in the pure states set , showing their relationship with asymptotic distillability properties , and satisfies most of the desirable properties .",
    "however , none of these have an operational expression , i.e. , they can not be calculated for arbitrary states .",
    "furthermore , they are defined only for bipartite states , not expressing the interesting properties of multipartite systems @xcite .",
    "other measures of entanglement for mixed states , not related with @xmath2 , have also been proposed .",
    "the robustness of entanglement ( @xmath7 ) quantifies the minimal amount of mixing with separable states needed to destroy the original entanglement presented in @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it follows easily from its definition that it can be used to quantify multipartite entanglement .",
    "however , it is calculable only for a few specialized bipartite density operators .",
    "the negativity @xmath9 is the only example of a computable quantifier @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , since it is based on the negativity of the eigenvalues of the partial transpose matrix @xmath10 of the system , it does not quantify the entanglement of positive - partial - transpose ( ppt ) states .",
    "moreover , it is defined only for bipartite correlations .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new computable measure for entanglement , which quantifies all different kinds of multipartite entanglement .",
    "its definition is based on the concept of entanglement witness . according to @xcite , an @xmath11-partite density operator @xmath12(the space of bounded operators acting on the hilbert space @xmath13 ) is non - separable iff there",
    "exists a self - adjoint operator @xmath14 which detects its entanglement , i.e. , such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 for all @xmath17 separable .",
    "this condition follows from the fact that the set of separable states is convex and closed in @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , as a conclusion of the hahn - banach theorem , for all entangled states there is a linear functional which separates it from this set .",
    "it will be necessary to consider only normalized entanglement witnesses such that @xmath19 .",
    "a hermitian operator @xmath20 is an optimal ew ( oew ) for the density operator @xmath21 if @xmath22 for every ew @xmath23 .",
    "although the above definition is different from the one introduced in @xcite , the optimal ews of both criteria are equal .",
    "it is important to stress the close relation between bell s inequalities and entanglement witnesses .",
    "since an ew is a hermitian operator , it is associated with a possible experiment whose expectation value in all separable states is positive .",
    "therefore , one may consider witness operators as generalized bell s inequalities , where the violation of the latter is replaced by a negative expectation value .",
    "of course bell s inequalities have an important role in the refutation of hidden loval variables theories for quantum mechanics , not shared by ews .",
    "nonetheless , in what concerns the detection of entanglement , entanglement witnesses can be considered just generalized bell s inequalities , with the locality condition of the later relaxed .",
    "thus , the optimal entanglement witness of a state @xmath21 can be identified with the experiment which most detects its entanglement , i.e. , which has the lowest possible expectation value .",
    "we will show that the result of this _ optimal _ experiment might be used to quantify entanglement .",
    "the witnessed entanglement @xmath24 of a multipartite state @xmath25 is given by @xmath26    the lack of an operational procedure to calculate entanglement measures in general is ultimately related to the complexity of distinguishing entangled from separable mixed states , which was shown to be np - hard @xcite . since an operational measure would also be a necessary and sufficient test for separability , we should not expect to find one .",
    "nevertheless , a procedure to calculate oew for all states with arbitrary probability and precision was recently introduced @xcite .",
    "although the optimization of entanglement witnesses is also np - hard @xcite , the optimization of approximate ew , operators which are positive for almost all separable states , can be realized very efficiently with a chosen probability . as the amount of violation ( the percentage of negative expectation values over the separable states set )",
    "can also be chosen , it is possible to reach the exact oew with any desired precision .",
    "thus , the witnessed entanglement ( we ) introduced earlier can be approximately calculated for all mixed states .",
    "besides having an interesting physical interpretation and an efficient numerical method of computation , the witnessed entanglement fulfills most of the usual requirements of a good entanglement measure @xcite .",
    "these properties can be summarized as :    \\(i ) e(@xmath27 ) = 0 if , and only if , @xmath27 is separable .",
    "\\(ii ) local unitary operations leave @xmath28 invariant , i.e , @xmath29    \\(iii ) ( monotonicity under locc ) entanglement can not increase under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) protocols .",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 is a superoperator implementable by locc .",
    "\\(iv ) ( continuity ) for every @xmath32 and density operators @xmath8 and @xmath27 , there is a real number @xmath33 such as @xmath34 where @xmath35 @xmath36 is any norm defined for finite dimensional systems .",
    "note that @xmath37 depends of the chosen norm .",
    "\\(v ) ( convexity ) mixing of states does not increase entanglement . @xmath38 for all @xmath8 , @xmath27 and @xmath39 .    the witnessed entanglement satisfies properties ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iv ) and ( v ) .",
    "( i ) : from the definition of entanglement witnesses we have that @xmath40 for all separable states @xmath27 . therefore",
    ", @xmath41 conversely , as there exists an ew for every entangled state , @xmath42 is positive for any non - separable density operator .",
    "( ii ) : we will prove by absurd that @xmath42 is invariant under local unitary operations .",
    "suppose that @xmath43 , where @xmath44 then , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an entanglement witness . but equation ( 9 ) contradicts the fact that @xmath47 is the oew for @xmath8 . if we suppose that @xmath48 , the same argument can be applied to @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 must hold .",
    "( iv ) : let @xmath47 and @xmath51 be optimal entanglement witnesses for @xmath8 and @xmath27 , respectively . if either @xmath8 or @xmath27 is separable , the result follows trivially .",
    "we then assume that @xmath52 as the intersection of the ews set with the set of hermitian matrices with unity trace is compact , we have that for some norm @xmath35 @xmath53 , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a real number .",
    "every norm of finite demensional operators are equivalent , i.e. , for every finite dimensional operator @xmath56 and any two chosen norms @xmath35 @xmath53 and @xmath35 @xmath36 , there always exists rela numbers @xmath11 and @xmath57 such that @xmath58 thus , one sees that equation ( 14 ) is valid for every norm .",
    "we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath59 ( d ) .",
    "hence , @xmath60 + tr(w_{\\rho}\\sigma ) - tr(w_{\\sigma}\\sigma)|.\\ ] ] since @xmath51 is a oew for @xmath27 , @xmath61 . from ( d )",
    "we also have @xmath62| \\geq |tr[(w_{\\rho } - w_{\\sigma})\\sigma]|$ ] . therefore , @xmath63 + tr(w_{\\rho}\\sigma ) - tr(w_{\\sigma}\\sigma)| \\leq |tr[w_{\\rho}(\\rho - \\sigma)]| \\leq ||w_{\\rho}||_{hs}||\\rho - \\sigma||_{hs},\\ ] ] where we have used the cauchy - schwartz inequality for the hilbert - schmidt inner product . from eq .",
    "( 17 ) and conditions ( b ) and ( c ) we then have that for every norm @xmath35 @xmath36 , @xmath64 for some real numbers @xmath65 .",
    "( v ) : the convexity follows straightforwardly from definition 2 and the concavity and convexity of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 functions , respectively .",
    "although @xmath68 is not a monotone under general locc maps , we can state the following :    for every unital locc map @xmath69 , @xmath70    it suffices to show that @xmath42 is not increasing under separable operations .",
    "let @xmath31 be a uninal trace - preserving separable quantum superoperator .",
    "then , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the dual map of @xmath31 , which is unital , since @xmath31 is trace preserving , and separable , and @xmath73 is the optimal ew for @xmath74 . , @xmath75 is also an ew .",
    "indeed , @xmath76 for all @xmath77 , since @xmath23 is an ew and @xmath78 .",
    "now we have to prove that @xmath79 . using that the channel is unital @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81 , @xmath82",
    "a @xmath11-partite density operator @xmath21 is a @xmath57-separable state if it is possible to find a decomposition for it such that in each pure state term at most m parties are entangled among each other , but not with any member of the other group of @xmath83 parties .",
    "since the subspace of m - separable density operators is convex and closed , it is also possible to apply the hahn - banach theorem to it and establish the concept of entanglement witness to @xmath84-partite entanglement . in order to do that ,",
    "consider the index set @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath86 be a subset of p which has at most m elements .",
    "then @xmath23 is an @xmath84-partite entanglement witness if :    @xmath87    equation @xmath88 assures that the operator @xmath23 is positive for all m - separable states .",
    "thus , it is also possible to determine optimal @xmath84-partite entanglement witnesses for every @xmath84-partite entangled state and establish an order in this set with @xmath42 .",
    "we have considered so far oew of the most general form .",
    "we will show that it is possible to construct another measure of entanglement for non - positive - partial - transpose - states ( npptes ) , reducing the search space of ew .",
    "witnesses operators can be classified as decomposable ( d - ew ) or not decomposable ( nd -ew)@xcite . in the case of bipartite entanglement , a hermitian operator @xmath23 is a @xmath89 if it can be written in the form of @xmath90 where p and q are positive operators .",
    "it is clear from this definition that these ews can not detect pptes .",
    "a @xmath91 is a hermitian operator which can not be written as @xmath92 .",
    "it was already shown that @xmath23 is a @xmath91 if , and only if , it detects pptes [ 12 ] .",
    "if we restrict our search of optimal ew to @xmath89 , we will still have a measure of entanglement , the decomposable witnessed entanglement ( @xmath93 ) , which satisfies the same properties of @xmath42 , despite the fact that it will be null for both separable and pptes .",
    "the advantage of this new measure is that it can be calculated in a straightforward manner .",
    "@xmath94 @xmath95 , where @xmath96 stands for the minimum eigenvalue of a.    if @xmath97 is separable or ppt , then @xmath98 will be non - negative and @xmath93 will be null . if @xmath97 is nppt , since @xmath99 , it is easy to see that the optimal d - ew will be @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the projector in the subspace of the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath102 .",
    "the negativity ( @xmath103 ) is another example of an entanglement measure which is both computable and null for pptes @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , for systems of two qubits , @xmath103 is equal to twice the absolute value of the negative eigenvalue of the partial transpose of the state .",
    "thus , in this dimension , it coincides with @xmath93 .",
    "the decomposable witnessed entropy of entanglement is particularly interesting for 2 x 2 and 2 x 3 systems .",
    "since there are no ppt entangled states in these cases , the optimal @xmath89 is the exact oew and @xmath42 and @xmath93 are equal .",
    "@xmath104 and @xmath105 for all 2 x 3 and 2 x 2 states , respectively .",
    "we have seen that , up to a dimension normalization factor , @xmath106 can be identified with the result of an experiment which has the lowest possible expectation value in @xmath8 , while it has non - negative expectation value in all separable states .",
    "@xmath106 is also related to the amount of mixing with the maximally random state @xmath107 needed to destroy the original entanglement presented in @xmath8 .",
    "this quantity , introduced in [ 9 ] , is called random robustness ( @xmath108 ) and is given by the minimum @xmath109 for which @xmath110 is separable .",
    "@xmath111 , for every multipartite density operator @xmath8 .    since @xmath112 is the minimum value for which @xmath113 is separable , @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , @xmath115 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that , for bipartite pure states , @xmath108 is given by the product of the two biggest schmidt coefficients with the dimension of the composite hilbert space .",
    "given a pure bipartite state @xmath116 with decreasing ordered schmidt coefficients @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "since @xmath108 is an upper bound for the robustness @xmath7 @xcite , it is possible to use the results presented in @xcite and establish the following order between different measures : @xmath119",
    "as an example , consider the following state of three qubits : @xmath120 , where @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we have calculated @xmath42 for genuine tripartite entanglement , bipartite entanglement of the possible partitions ( ab - c , a - bc and ac - b ) , and bipartite entanglement of the reduced density matrices ( a - b , a - c and b - c ) .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "1 . since the state is symmetric with respect to exchange of the particles , the amount of bipartite entanglement in the three partitions and in the three reduced density matrices are the same .",
    "the value of @xmath93 , which was also calculated for the three partitions , and @xmath42 are the same , showing that it is not possible to reach a bound entangled state mixing the identity with this family of states .",
    "note in addition that the the witnessed entanglement gives the same order than the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite and the geometric measure of entanglement @xcite for the w and ghz states .     as a function of @xmath123 for the tripartite entanglement ( 1 ) , for the bipartite entanglement in any of the three partitions ( 2 ) , for the bipartite entanglement in any of the three reduced density matrices ( 4 ) , and @xmath93 as a function of @xmath123 for the bipartite entanglement in any of the three partitions ( 3 ) .",
    "in summary , we have introduced a new measure of entanglement which is operational and can be used to quantify all different types of multipartite entanglement .",
    "it has two interesting physical interpretations and is connected to several other different measures .",
