    "the need for a hamiltonian description of dissipative systems has long been known , having been emphasized by morse and feshbach ( * ? ? ? * ch 3.2 ) forty years ago .",
    "recently we have introduced conservative @xcite and then hamiltonian @xcite theories of time dispersive and dissipative ( tdd ) systems addressing that need .",
    "the extended hamiltonian is constructed by coupling the given tdd system to a system of  hidden strings \" in a canonical way so that it has a transparent interpretation as the system energy .",
    "it turns out that such a system of hidden strings is , in fact , a canonical heat bath as described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) .",
    "this work is intended as a self contained companion to the papers @xcite , illustrating the phenomena described there through explicit calculations for the typical example of a tdd string .    to keep everything elementary ,",
    "let us consider a scalar wave equation in one spatial dimension , such as might be used to describe wave propagation along a homogeneous string . in the absence of dispersion",
    ", the displacement @xmath0 of the string at position @xmath1 and time @xmath2 evolves by the @xmath3 wave equation @xmath4 where    * @xmath5 is the tension of the string .",
    "* we have taken units in which the mass per unit length is @xmath6 .",
    "* @xmath7 is an external _ driving force _ per unit length , usually supposed bounded and compactly supported .    for the most part , we consider with the string _ at rest _ at @xmath8 , @xmath9 thus the solution @xmath0 is a function of the driving force @xmath7 , indeed @xmath10 with @xmath11 the speed of propagation on the string .",
    "in this paper we consider a modification of incorporating friction in the form of a dissipative term with time dispersion .",
    "specifically , we consider the following equation @xmath12 with @xmath13 a given function , called the susceptibility , satisfying a power dissipation condition below .",
    "the physical idea behind is as follows .",
    "the wave equation can be expressed in terms of the string momentum @xmath14 as @xmath15 in the damped string , the basic relation @xmath16 `` sum of all forces '' still holds , but the simple relationship @xmath17 between the string momentum and velocity is replaced by the _ material relation _",
    "@xmath18 eq .",
    "is supposed to be a phenomenological relation describing the interaction of the string with a surrounding medium , expressing the fact that some of the string momentum is absorbed by the medium and then partially retransmitted to the string with delay .",
    "the wave equation may be expressed as a hamiltonian system . as described in @xcite , the procedure of going from to",
    "is naturally understood in this context and indeed _ can be derived from a larger hamiltonian system , with additional variables . _",
    "the additional variables of this extension may be interpreted as describing a `` hidden string , '' with internal coordinate @xmath19 , attached to each point @xmath20 of the physical string ( see figure [ fig : strings ] ) .",
    "[ ptb ]    these `` hidden strings '' are coupled to the physical string via a coupling function @xmath21 , but do not interact directly with one another . ]",
    "the extensions for such systems involve interaction between the hidden strings , but for simplicity we do not pursue this here . ] upon `` integrating out '' the hidden strings ,",
    "the result is an effective dynamics of the form for the physical string , with susceptibility @xmath22 different choices of the coupling function @xmath21 produce different susceptibilities @xmath13 , and furthermore @xcite any susceptibility satisfying the power dissipation condition   below  can be obtained in this way .    given the role of the tdd wave equation as a phenomenological description for the interaction of the string with its environment , it is not surprising that an extended system exists which produces the effective dynamics , at least approximately .",
    "however , the main point of @xcite , which we explain below , is that it is possible to construct _ explicitly _ an extended system which _ exactly _ reproduces .",
    "further , using that system we can derive simple expressions for quantities like the energy and wave momentum densities for the damped string in terms of the susceptibility @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , as illustrated below , the extended system clarifies the nature and role of eigenfunctions in a tdd system by providing a natural eigenmode expansion for solutions to . in this context ,",
    "an eigenfunction @xmath24 is a time periodic steady state solution to .",
    "for the simple non - dissipative string , an eigenmode solves @xmath25 which is to say it is a linear superposition of the plane waves @xmath26 . for the tdd string ,",
    "the dissipation induced by the dispersion in may preclude the existence of a steady state solution without a source term .",
    "however , there is no difficulty in constructing the eigenmodes for the _ extended system _ , as it is without dissipation . we find below that the resulting eigenmode equation for @xmath27 @xmath28 has a source term involving an _ arbitrary _ function @xmath29 , which depends on the configuration of the hidden strings . here",
    "@xmath30 is the @xmath31-fourier transform of @xmath23 , @xmath32    let us now sketch the construction of the hamiltonian extension .",
    "to start we write as a first order system , introducing the momentum density @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 this first order system is hamiltonian , with symplectic form @xmath35 and time dependent hamilton function @xmath36 as the system is non - autonomous , @xmath37 is not conserved .",
    "instead along a trajectory to , we have @xmath38 we take the internal energy of the ( undamped ) string to be the hamilton function @xmath39 of the system with @xmath40 . thus , using we obtain @xmath41 in other words , the rate of work done on the system is the integral of the external force times the velocity ",
    "`` power @xmath42 force @xmath43 velocity . ''",
    "observe that the hamiltonian @xmath44 can be written @xmath45 where @xmath46 based on this expression , we separate the equations of motion , into `` material relations '' @xmath47 and dynamical equations ,",
    "@xmath48    to obtain a first order tdd system leading to , we follow @xcite and replace the identity ( [ eq : fpi ] ) with the `` material relation , '' @xmath49 but maintain and the equations of motion , i.e. , @xmath50 ( one could also introduce dispersion in the relation between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , or even dispersion mixing @xmath52 and @xmath53 , but for simplicity we consider here only tdd in the momentum . ) the key requirements on the _ susceptibility _ @xmath23 are    1 .",
    "causality , manifest in ( [ eq : fpitdd ] ) in that the integral on the l.h.s .",
    "depends only on the past .",
    "power dissipation , which is the requirement that for every @xmath20 @xmath54 for an arbitrary function @xmath55 , say compactly supported .",
    "the significance of the power dissipation condition is as follows .",
    "we suppose that the internal energy of the tdd system at time @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 with @xmath58 as in .",
    "then @xmath59   \\partial_t \\phi(x , t ) \\ , \\mathrm d x , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in going from the third to the final line we have used integration by parts and the assumption that @xmath60 and @xmath53 vanish at spatial infinity . the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "is the rate of work done on the system by the external force @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , we interpret the second term as the power loss of the dissipative force , @xmath62 .",
    "thus , power dissipation amounts to the requirement that , for any trajectory , the _ total work done by the dissipative force is negative_.    let us note that the right hand side of is equal to @xmath63(x,|t_1-t_2| ) \\bigr \\ } g(t_1 ) g(t_2 ) \\ ,",
    "\\mathrm d^2 t , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which follows from integration by parts after noting that @xmath64 . here",
    "@xmath65 is the dirac delta function .",
    "thus the power dissipation condition is equivalent to the statement that for every @xmath20 the ( generalized ) function @xmath66(x,|t|)\\ ] ] is _ positive definite _ in the sense of the classical bochner s theorem , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "the simplest physically relevant example of a susceptibility satisfying the power dissipation condition is obtained with @xmath71 , a positive constant .",
    "then @xmath72 using the equation of motion @xmath73 , we find that @xmath74 where we have applied the boundary condition @xmath75 . combined with the equation of motion @xmath76",
    "we obtain @xmath77 which is the dynamical equation for a driven damped string , with damping force per unit length @xmath78 note that @xmath79 is dimensionally an inverse time and @xmath80 is the characteristic time for the damping of oscillations .    a more realistic model for damping",
    "is obtained by supposing @xmath13 to be a non - trivial function of @xmath31 as in ( [ eq : fpitdd ] ) . to allow for damping restricted to only a part of the string",
    ", we suppose that @xmath23 depends on @xmath20 as well .",
    "for instance , we could take the debye susceptibility @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 non - negative functions of @xmath20 .",
    "this results in the following integral - differential equation for @xmath51 @xmath84 or after integration by parts @xmath85 then @xmath86 so the debye susceptibility satisfies the power dissipation condition .",
    "the results of @xcite show that under the above conditions it is possible to find a coupling function @xmath21 , @xmath87 , such that solutions to the tdd equations are generated by solutions to the following extended system @xmath88 with @xmath89 that is , given a solution @xmath90 to , at rest at @xmath8 and with @xmath53 given by , the first two coordinates @xmath91 obey with @xmath53 given by , and conversely any solution to ( [ eq : fpitdd ] , [ eq : tddmotion ] ) with the string at rest at @xmath8 arises in this way .",
    "note that for each fixed @xmath20 the additional variables @xmath92 may be interpreted as describing the oscillations of a `` hidden string '' with coordinate @xmath19 , displacement @xmath93 , momentum @xmath94 and driven by external force @xmath95 .",
    "thus is precisely the system of coupled strings described above and illustrated in figure [ fig : strings ] .",
    "the extended system , consisting of the physical and hidden strings is hamiltonian with symplectic form @xmath96 and hamilton function @xmath97 where @xmath53 is given by , that is @xmath98 .",
    "the dynamical equation for an excitation of the hidden string at @xmath20 is a driven wave equation @xmath99 the solution to with the hidden string at rest at @xmath8 is easily written down , see : @xmath100 thus @xmath101    f_\\pi(x , t-\\tau ) \\ ,    \\mathrm d \\tau .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] comparing and we see that for the extension to reproduce the tdd system upon elimination of @xmath102 and @xmath103 it is necessary and sufficient that the coupling @xmath21 satisfy , that is @xmath104 the existence of such a function , which is unique under a natural symmetry assumption , is guaranteed by the power dissipation condition @xcite .    indeed , if we let @xmath105 denote the @xmath19-fourier transform of @xmath106 , @xmath107 then is equivalent to @xmath108 so it suffices to take @xcite @xmath109 furthermore , this choice of @xmath110 is unique if we ask further that @xmath111 and that @xmath112 be symmetric . then , @xmath113 is real , symmetric , and positive definite .",
    "for example , in view of , , and , the following coupling produces the debye susceptibility , @xmath114 where @xmath115 that is , @xmath116",
    "we interpret the hamiltonian @xmath117 with @xmath40 as the internal energy of the damped string system consisting of the coupled physical and hidden strings . we have conservation of energy in the extended system , in the form",
    "@xmath118 i.e. , the rate of change of @xmath117 is the rate of work done on the system by the external force .",
    "a significant advantage of working with the extended system is a transparent interpretation of the energy of the dissipative string as a sum of contributions from the physical and hidden strings .",
    "that is , it is natural to break the @xmath117 into two pieces @xmath119 the energy of the physical string and hidden strings respectively , @xmath120 with @xmath53 given by .",
    "the internal energy @xmath117 can be written as the integral of a local energy density @xmath121 with @xmath122 the energy conservation law has the following local expression @xmath123 with the energy current @xmath124    it is interesting to compute the time derivatives of @xmath125 and @xmath126 alone : @xmath127 with @xmath128 where we have used .",
    "the first of these equations is simply the local version of the energy law for the tdd string . from the second",
    ", we see that the energy of the hidden strings , which is the energy lost to dissipation up to time @xmath56 , is @xmath129    if the susceptibility @xmath23  and hence the coupling @xmath106  is independent of @xmath20 , then the extended system is invariant under spatial translations .",
    "associated to this symmetry is a local conservation law @xmath130 for the wave momentum density @xmath131 with wave momentum flux , called _ stress _",
    ", @xmath132 when the driving force vanishes , @xmath133 , the total wave momentum @xmath134 is a conserved quantity .",
    "the wave momentum density @xmath135 is again a sum of contributions @xmath136 from the physical and hidden strings .",
    "likewise we separate the stress @xmath137 into two pieces , @xmath138 then @xmath139    when we study eigenfunctions below , it will be convenient to work with complex valued solutions . in the above expressions , terms which are quadratic in the field variables",
    "should be modified in the complex case by the replacement @xmath140 .",
    "that is @xmath141 etc .",
    "it is useful and interesting to study steady state solutions to the extended system , for example solutions which are periodic in time @xmath142 @xmath143 .",
    "we refer to the spatial component @xmath144 @xmath143 of such a time periodic solution as an eigenfunction for the linear system with eigenvalue @xmath145 .",
    "thus an eigenfunction satisfies @xmath146 with @xmath147    we see that the displacement of the hidden string at position @xmath20 satisfies @xmath148 so @xmath149 with @xmath150 and @xmath151 undetermined functions of @xmath20 . here , @xmath152 denotes the `` principle value '' integral , @xmath153    \\widehat \\varsigma(x,\\sigma ) \\ , \\mathrm d    \\sigma . \\end{aligned}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    by , we see that @xmath154 recalling , that @xmath155 , we see that the final term on the r.h.s .  can be expressed @xmath156 where we have used the symmetry @xmath157 and the `` kramers - krnig relation '' @xmath158    plugging this result into and combining the first two equations of we find that the string displacement @xmath51 solves the following elliptic problem @xmath159 in analyzing we should distinguish two cases :    1 .",
    "@xmath160 for all @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath161 non zero for @xmath20 in an open set .    in the first case , which is non - generic , the medium described by the hidden strings is not absorbing at the given frequency @xmath145 , that is",
    "@xmath162 is real for every @xmath20 .",
    "thus is a very strong restriction on @xmath27 , namely that it should satisfy the schrdinger equation @xmath163 with potential @xmath164 and spectral parameter @xmath165 . in the second case",
    ", the physical string displacement may be decomposed as follows @xmath166 where @xmath167 is any solution to the non - dissipative eigenfunction equation @xmath168 and @xmath169 is an _",
    "arbitrary function with support in @xmath170 .",
    "_ indeed , given @xmath171 and @xmath169 we need only choose @xmath172 to be @xmath173 to obtain a solution to .",
    "_ thus , the physical string displacement for an eigenmode @xmath174 may be chosen arbitrarily within that part of the string which is absorbing at the given frequency _ @xmath175 .",
    "we want to emphasize the significance of this fact , since the formal eigenvalue problem @xmath176does not allow for such arbitrariness in the choice of @xmath174 .",
    "the resolution to this apparent contradiction lies in recognizing that a tdd system is an open part of a larger conservative hamiltonian system .",
    "it is only for the extended hamiltonian system that the eigenmodes @xmath177 are unambiguously defined with @xmath178 a stationary solution to the canonical hamiltonian evolution equation .",
    "the `` legitimate '' eigenmodes for the original tdd string consist of projections @xmath27 of the eigenmodes @xmath179 onto the subspace of the physical string .",
    "thus a tdd string , being an open system has as many eigenmodes , i.e stationary solutions , as its the minimal conservative extension , introduced and described in @xcite .",
    "in particular , a finite - dimensional tdd system typically has infinitely many stationary solutions and , hence , infinitely many eigenmodes .",
    "another view on the construction of eigenmodes follows .",
    "the eigenfunctions written down above , involving as they do arbitrary excitations of the hidden strings , may not be relevant to the dynamics with the external force acting on the physical string .",
    "indeed , note that the effective equation for @xmath27 does not depend on the term @xmath180 appearing in .",
    "we shall see that eigenmodes with @xmath181 are not needed in the expansion of a general solution to with a compactly supported external force .",
    "essentially this is due to the fact that the configuration of the hidden strings remains symmetric throughout the evolution .    to proceed , it is convenient to introduce the fourier - laplace transform @xmath182 defined for    1 .",
    "@xmath183 if @xmath184 super exponentially fast as @xmath185 , for instance if @xmath186 is compactly supported in time . 2 .",
    "@xmath187 if @xmath184 super exponentially fast as @xmath188 .",

    "taking the fourier - laplace transform of results in the following equations @xmath191 with @xmath192    due to our consideration of solutions with the strings at rest at @xmath8 , we expect the quantities in to be well defined only for @xmath193 .",
    "however , if the driving force is compactly supported in time then @xmath194 is defined for all @xmath195 , and we may extend @xmath196 to @xmath197 by solving . following the eigenfunction analysis , we obtain , with @xmath198 sign of @xmath199 , @xmath200 where @xmath201 is defined for @xmath202 as @xmath203    for a function @xmath186 vanishing at @xmath204 or @xmath205 we have the fourier inversion formula @xmath206 with @xmath207 arbitrary . inverting",
    "the solution to with @xmath208 or @xmath209 produces distinct solutions to : for @xmath210 we obtain the desired _ causal _ solution with the strings at rest at @xmath211 , while for @xmath212 we obtain the _ anti - causal _ solution with the strings at rest at @xmath213 .    in a certain sense",
    "we are only interested in the causal solution to and thus to the solution to only for @xmath214 in the upper half plane . however , since involves a source term , this solution , often called the _ resolvent _ , is not directly expressed as a superposition of eigenfunctions .",
    "however , there is a general procedure for decomposing the solution to into a superposition of eigenfunctions .",
    "namely for @xmath215 we define @xmath216 since @xmath194 is continuous at each @xmath217 , it follows from that @xmath218 @xmath219 is an eigenfunction for each @xmath145 . to recover the resolvent for @xmath214 in the upper half plane from the eigenfunctions , suppose that the external force is supported in the set @xmath220 .",
    "then @xmath221 thus @xmath222 is bounded in the upper half plane , and by analyticity we have , against this measure .",
    "for the systems of coupled strings considered here , however , these boundary measures are always absolutely continuous , so holds with @xmath223 defined for almost every @xmath145 by . ]",
    "@xmath224 expressing the solution to as a superposition of eigenfunctions .",
    "( there is a similar formula for the advanced solution with @xmath225 , involving an upper bound @xmath226 on the support of the external force . )",
    "now let us fix @xmath145 and suppose that we have an eigenfunction of the form .",
    "then by and , @xmath227 with @xmath228 in other words , the eigenfunctions which appear in the expansion are of the form with @xmath229 .",
    "we refer to such eigenfunctions as _ spectral _ eigenfunctions . by",
    ", the spectral eigenfunctions form a complete set for the description of the dynamics of the extended system .",
    "thus , the freedom to choose @xmath29 in provides us with a rich enough family of solutions to describe the dynamics of the tdd string .",
    "note that for @xmath230 , a solution to satisfies the eigenmode equation away from the spatial support of the driving force .",
    "thus , one may try to produce eigenfunctions via a solution to with a `` source at infinity , '' that is as a limit of a sequence of solutions to with driving forces supported farther and farther from the origin . depending on the susceptibility and the sequence of driving forces , the limit may or may exist and be a non zero",
    ". however , when this procedure leads to a non - trivial limit , the resulting eigenmodes are of the form with a special choice of the arbitrary function @xmath29 . if we solve in the upper or lower half planes , we obtain in this way    1 .",
    "the _ causal eigenfunctions _ with @xmath231 , @xmath232 corresponding to a driving force in the distant past and the causal boundary condition with the strings at rest at @xmath8 .",

    "[ sec : planewave ] below we construct a rich family of bounded plane wave solutions for a homogeneous string , using with suitable choices for the source term @xmath29 .",
    "this is not to say that the causal and anti - causal eigenfunctions are always irrelevant .",
    "that depends on the physics , and indeed the formal eigenvalue problem can be useful in the right context .",
    "for instance , if dissipation is restricted to a proper subset of the string , or more generally if @xmath239 falls off sufficiently fast as @xmath240 , then among the causal eigenfunctions are scattering solutions which describe the reflection and transmission of a plane wave emitted from a source at @xmath241 . in the complete family of spectral eigenfunctions",
    "these solutions are very special , however they are precisely those solutions needed to analyze the extended dynamics for a driving force situated very far from the dissipative portion of the string . in section [ sec : scattering ] we illustrate the role of causal eigenfunctions in scattering theory by computing the scattering modes for a string in which dissipation is restricted to @xmath242 .",
    "the energy density @xmath243 in an eigenfunction , at a point @xmath20 with @xmath244 , is typically infinite due to the contribution from the hidden strings .",
    "this result is to be expected physically as the eigenfunction represents the idealized steady propagation of a monochromatic wave through an absorbing medium with infinite heat capacity .",

    "the energy density of the physical string @xmath251 is constant in time , and there is a constant rate of dissipation at each @xmath20 with @xmath252 , @xmath253 thus the eigenfunction represents a steady state situation in which energy is flowing into or out of the hidden strings at a constant rate at each point @xmath20 with @xmath254 .    for a general spectral eigenfunction , the dissipation @xmath255 may be positive or negative , however for a causal eigenfunction , with @xmath256 , we have @xmath257 corresponding to a steady dissipation of energy from the physical string into the medium , represented by the hidden strings .",

    "more precisely , the dissipation of energy to the medium , as described by the hidden strings , is exactly balanced by the energy emitted from the medium . the energy density of the physical string is @xmath281 and the energy density of the medium , described by the hidden strings , is of course infinite .",
    "as the system is homogeneous , we can also consider the wave momentum density and stress in a plane wave eigenfunction . by the wave momentum density of the physical string is @xmath282 where @xmath283 thus @xmath284 the wave momentum density of the hidden strings is infinite , since @xmath285 by",
    ".    of more interest is the stress , which by ( [ eq : ttotal ] , [ eq : t0 ] ) is @xmath286 where @xmath125 given by and @xmath287 is formally @xmath288 with @xmath289 to evaluate the integral in it is useful to write @xmath290 where we have used . thus @xmath291 it follows that @xmath292 if , for instance , @xmath293 is integrable .",
    "thus @xmath294 which is identical to the result for the undamped string !",
    "to close , we would like to illustrate the power of the above method by unambiguously constructing the scattering states representing an idealized description of the following experiment .",
    "imagine that we have an long , i.e. , infinite , string whose right half ( @xmath295 ) is subject to dispersion and dissipation with susceptibility @xmath296 .",
    "that is , the the susceptibility for the whole string is @xmath297 suppose we drive the left end of the string , at @xmath298 , periodically with frequency @xmath145 , sending an incoming wave toward the tdd right half of the string .",
    "after some time a steady state is reached in which a certain fraction of the incoming wave is absorbed by the dissipative half of the string and a certain fraction is reflected .",
    "the steady state eigenfunction describing the above experiment is a causal eigenfunction since the source is at @xmath298 and in the distant past .",
    "thus by , the string displacement satisfies @xmath299    \\widehat \\chi(\\omega ) \\bigr ) \\phi_\\omega(x ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath300=1 $ ] for @xmath242 and @xmath301 otherwise .",
    "indeed , this is the naive equation that one might right down for the scattering states of a tdd string .",
    "however , it is only within the context of the extended hamiltonian system that we understand this to be only one of many possible eigenfunction equations , the choice of which is dictated by the physics under consideration , namely a source at spatial infinity in the distant past .",
    "by , we have @xmath302 on the left half of the string , up to an over all multiple which we fix to be @xmath6 without loss . in the term @xmath303",
    "is the incoming wave and @xmath304 is the reflected wave .    to find the reflection coefficient @xmath305 we need to solve for the form of the eigenfunction on the right half of the string .",
    "again by , we have @xmath306 for @xmath242 .",
    "furthermore , since we require the solution to be bounded this determines @xmath51 uniquely up to an over all multiple @xmath307 where @xmath308 is an , as yet , undetermined transmission coefficient and @xmath309{\\frac{\\omega^2}{\\gamma } ( 1 + \\widehat    \\chi(\\omega ) ) } .\\ ] ] here @xmath310{z}$ ] denotes the unique square root of @xmath311 in the upper half plane . is real and @xmath312 then the medium transmits at frequency @xmath145 and @xmath313 should be determined as the limit @xmath314{\\frac{(\\omega+ \\mathrm i \\delta)^2}{\\gamma } ( 1 + \\widehat    \\chi(\\omega + \\mathrm i \\delta ) ) } .\\ ] ] ] since @xmath315 , at least if @xmath316 , we see that @xmath317 decays exponentially in the dissipative half of the physical string ( @xmath242 ) .",
    "the excitation of the hidden strings , which are restricted to @xmath318 , is given by : @xmath319    to determine @xmath308 and @xmath305 we note that the eigenfunction equation forces @xmath27 and @xmath320 to be continuous functions of @xmath20 , in particular at @xmath321 .",
    "thus , @xmath322 we conclude that @xmath323 where @xmath324{1 + \\widehat \\chi(\\omega ) } & \\omega > 0 , \\\\ -      \\sqrt[+]{1 + \\widehat \\chi(\\omega ) } & \\omega < 0 .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ]    it is useful to consider some general properties of @xmath325 and the reflection and transmission coefficients . to begin note that since @xmath326 we have @xmath327{1 + \\widehat \\chi(\\omega ) } \\",
