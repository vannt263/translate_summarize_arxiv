    "the ultraviolet radiation emitted by quasars ( qsos ) is considered the dominant source of ionisation of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at redshifts 2 - 4 .",
    "most of the absorption lines seen blue - ward of the emission in qso spectra ( the so - called forest ) are ascribed to fluctuations in the low to intermediate density igm ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) . as a consequence",
    ", lines can be used as probes of the properties and redshift evolution of the uv ionising background .",
    "observations show that the number density of lines increases with redshift , but within single qso spectra the number density of lines decreases as the redshift approaches the qso emission redshift .",
    "this effect was first noticed by @xcite and confirmed by later studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite called this deficiency of absorptions near the background qso `` proximity effect '' and attributed it to the increased ionisation of the clouds near the qso due to its ionising flux .",
    "they used the proximity effect in 19 low resolution qso spectra to estimate the intensity of the ultraviolet background radiation ( uvb ) at the lyman limit or @xmath10  . ] , @xmath11 , for which they found the value @xmath12 ergs @xmath13 sec@xmath7 hz@xmath7 sr@xmath7 over the redshift range @xmath14 .",

    "they obtained @xmath17 , using 10 higher resolution ( @xmath18 ) qso spectra in the same redshift interval as @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite considered a sample of 74 intermediate resolution qso spectra in the redshift interval @xmath19 , from which they obtained a value @xmath20 .",
    "these authors paid a particular attention to the correct estimate of the systemic redshift of the qsos . indeed ,",
    "if a qso redshift lower than the true one is used in the analysis , the ionising effect of the qso on the clouds , and thus the derived value of @xmath21 , are over - estimated .",
    "in the standard analysis of the proximity effect it is assumed that the matter distribution is not altered by the presence of the qso . the only difference between the gas close to and far away from the qso is the increased photoionisation rate due to the qso emission .",
    "a consequence of this hypothesis is that there should be a correlation between the strength of the proximity effect and the luminosity of the qso .",
    "however , observational results are not conclusive on this subject ( e.g. @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is in fact likely that qsos occupy over - dense regions .",
    "hierarchical models of structure formation predict that super - massive black holes , that are thought to power qsos , are in massive halos @xcite which are strongly biased to high - density regions .",
    "the main aim of this work is to investigate the density distribution of matter close to qsos from the proximity effect . to this purpose",

    "flo converts the list of  column densities of lines in a qso spectrum into the underlying hydrogen density field .",
    "this method significantly reduces the drawbacks of the line fitting approach , in particular , the dependence on the fitting tool , the subjectivity of the result , and the strong dependence of statistics on the number of weak lines , which is in general poorly known .",
    "we could also constrain the value of the uvb ionisation rate , @xmath22 where , @xmath23 is the photo - ionisation cross section , @xmath24 is the frequency at the lyman limit and @xmath25 . ] , by matching the recovered density field in the forest region with the mean cosmic density .",

    "section  [ sectobs ] reports the details of the observed data sample , the qso emission redshift and luminosity determination , and the fitting analysis . in section[sect_prox ] , the proximity effect of qsos on the surrounding gaseous medium is pointed out and the over - density close to qsos is reconstructed with flo .",

    "flo ( from lines to over - densities ) was introduced in paper i. the physical hypotheses at the base of this procedure are briefly described in the following paragraphs .",
    "traditionally , the analysis of the forest was based on the identification and voigt fit of the absorption lines in order to derive the central redshift , the column density and the doppler parameter ( measuring the velocity dispersion in the line ) .",
    "this approach has two main drawbacks : ( i ) the subjectivity of the decomposition into components : the same complex absorption can be resolved by different scientists ( or software tools ) in different ways , both in the number of components , and in the values of the output parameters for a single component ; ( ii ) the blanketing effect of weak lines : they can be hidden by the stronger lines , so that their exact number density is unknown and has to be inferred from statistical arguments . unfortunately , since the weak lines are also the most numerous , the uncertainty in their exact number is transformed into a systematic error of the computed statistical quantities .",
    "the flo technique extends the line fitting approach by identifying a new statistical estimator describing the physical properties of the underlying igm , the hydrogen density @xmath36 , which is linked to the measured   column density through the formula @xcite : @xmath37 where , @xmath38 is the density contrast , @xmath39 k is the temperature at the mean density , @xmath40 s@xmath7 is the h photo - ionisation rate due to the uv background , @xmath41 is the fraction of the mass in gas and @xmath42 is the index of the temperature - density relation for the igm which depends on the ionisation history of the universe .",

    "[ tra ] we have , first of all , to go through the voigt fitting process of the forest absorptions in a qso spectrum .",
    "then , to transform the list of  column densities of lines into the matter density field which generated them , we have to perform the following steps :    \\(1 ) group adjacent lines into absorbers of size of 1 with column density equal to the sum of column densities and redshift equal to the weighted average of redshifts , using column densities as weights .",
    "the absorbers are created with a friend - of - friend algorithm :    1 .",
    "the spatial separation between all the possible line pairs is computed and the minimum separation is compared with , computed at the -weighted redshift mean of the pair ; 2 .",

    "two cases are considered for the treatment of the empty bins : in the ` lower limit ' case the bin is filled with an absorber of null column density ( corresponding to @xmath46 ) , while in the ` upper limit ' case the bin is filled with an absorber with hydrogen density contrast corresponding to the minimum detectable column density in our data , @xmath47@xmath48 , at the redshift of the bin .    for the igm parameters in eqs .",

    "figure  [ distrib_lj ] and [ contour_lj ] shows the results of those tests .",
    "both the true density field and the reconstructed one along the simulated lines of sight were rebinned into steps of 1 jeans length .",
    "the recovered density field from the simulated lines of sight presents two main problems : ( i ) most of the points of the true density field belonging to under - dense regions are not recovered with the correct @xmath45-value , they are accounted for as empty bins or , for those approaching the average density , their value is over - estimated and they are moved to moderately over - dense regions ; ( ii ) the number of points in the over - dense regions is over - estimated due to a systematic assignment of larger - than - true @xmath45-values to those points .",
    "the latter effect causes also an over - estimate of the average @xmath45 of the distribution which is @xmath52 percent higher than that of the true density field . in paper",
    "i , we solved this problem by normalising both the true and the reconstructed @xmath45-field in order to have the same mean value , @xmath53 .",
    "this solution is not viable for the present analysis , so we looked for the physical reasons of the wrong reconstruction in order to improve the performances of flo .",
    "the failure in reproducing the under - dense regions is likely due to the fact that gas below the average density is still expanding and our primary hypothesis , the local hydrostatic equilibrium , can not be applied .",
    "there is no simple solution to this problem , however we have already tested in paper i that under - dense regions have a negligible effect on statistical quantities .",
    "the problem regarding the moderately over - dense regions depends on the scale adopted for the reconstruction of the absorbers , the jeans length , which appears to be too large . as a consequence ,",
    "absorbers have on average too large column densities which translate into an over - estimate of the @xmath45-values for the over - dense regions .",
    "the need for a smoothing length smaller than  to better reproduce the density field traced by the forest , was discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "they affirmed that the correct filtering scale depends on the re - ionisation history of the universe and is in general smaller than the jeans scale after re - ionisation , and larger prior to it .",

    "a temperature at the average density almost a factor of two lower than the reference one , which implied a decrease in the smoothing scale of @xmath127 percent , could reconcile values of @xmath153 with the igm average density but not values as large as @xmath154 . however , this temperature is at the lowest end of the measured temperatures in the igm at the considered redshifts .",

    "the density contrast , the temperature , and the peculiar velocity are known pixel by pixel .",
    "peculiar velocities are small , typically less than 100 @xmath169 , and randomly oriented .",
    "however , since the observed density fields were recovered in redshift space , the mock lines of sight were modified by correcting the redshifts of the density field ( @xmath170 ) with the peculiar velocity field to obtain the density field in redshift space ( @xmath171 ) using the formula @xmath172 and the periodic - boundary conditions . then , the mock loss were shifted ( applying the periodic - boundary condition ) in order to have the peak of the most massive halo ( where the qso should reside ) in the first pixel and the proper separation from this pixel was computed for all the other pixels .",

    "the simulated @xmath45 field is consistent with the mean igm density down to 4 mpc and up to 48 mpc ( see zoomed window ) .",
    "the disagreement between the simulated and observed density contrast in the first bin and , in particular , the large value of @xmath45 obtained from the mock spectra , could be explained by the fact that the considered simulations do not include in the most massive halos the presence of the agn that would accrete part of the gas in the peak .",
    "in this work , we used a sample of @xmath1  absorption lines obtained from high resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of 21 qsos in the redshift range @xmath173 and the flo algorithm for the reconstruction of baryon density fields ( described in details in paper i ) to investigate the baryon distribution as a function of the distance from the qso .",
    "the effect of the qso radiation ( supposed to be isotropic ) dominates over the uv background ( uvb ) in a sphere with radius varying from @xmath3 to 15 mpc for our sample , with an average of @xmath174 mpc .",
    "the increased ionisation flux modifies the local line number density causing the so - called _ proximity effect _",
    ", that was used in the past to estimate the intensity of the uvb at the lyman limit .",
    "however , the local line number density is determined not only by the ratio between the uv flux from the qso and the uvb but also by a variation of the density field due to the fact that qsos likely lie on density peaks .",
    "the recovery is extremely sensitive to the emission redshift and to the uv flux of the qsos .",
    "we spent a significant effort to obtain , both from the literature and from the spectra at our disposal , the best estimates for the systemic redshifts of the qsos in our sample in order to reduce the uncertainties to less than @xmath128 .",

    ", we adopted three different models : two with a power law with a fixed slope and one for which each qso has its own slope obtained from the comparison with a spectral library .",
    "the resulting ionisation rates for the three models are within a factor of two .",
    "we improved the performances of flo with respect of paper i by adopting a smoothing scale @xmath127 percent smaller than the jeans length , following the prescription by @xcite .",
    "this contrivance allows us to solve the problem of over - estimation of the over - densities we had in paper i and to correctly recover the mean density in the igm .",
    "we applied the flo algorithm to each qso spectrum and recovered the sample - averaged @xmath45 field as a function of the distance from the emitting sources , in bins of 4 proper mpc .",
    "the obtained results are described in the following sections .",

    "this uncertainty can be improved by using more spectra with a larger    signal - to - noise ratio .",
