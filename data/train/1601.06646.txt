    "in fluids near their liquid - gas critical point , the characteristic size of the density fluctuations becomes larger than the characteristic size of the molecular structure .",
    "consequently , the fluid behavior is ruled by fluctuations and not by its particular molecular structure .",
    "this implies that most fluids behave similarly near the critical point ( like the 3d ising model ) .",
    "this universality makes the study of near critical fluids very appealing . due to their very low thermal diffusivity and to their very large thermal expansion and compressibility",
    ", the study of heat transfer in such fluids is particularly challenging .",
    "when such a fluid is confined in a heated cavity , a very thin hot boundary layer develops and induces a fast expansion that compresses the rest of the fluid .",
    "the resulting pressure waves spread at the sound velocity ( i.e very rapidly ) and adiabatically compress the bulk of the fluid which is therefore homogeneously heated . after several sound wave periods the pressure is already equilibrated and can be assumed to be nearly homogeneous along the cavity . during the initial stage of heating ,",
    "this process of energy transfer , called  piston effect \" @xcite , is much more efficient than the usual diffusion scenario .",
    "indeed , if the piston effect were absent , the bulk of the fluid would remain at the initial temperature .    in the industrial domain ,",
    "the piston effect can be used to transfer heat much faster than by conduction .",
    "this feature can be readily applied to the development of heat exchangers under microgravity conditions @xcite where heat transfer by natural convection is obviously not possible .    while the physical origin of the piston effect is well understood , the calculations required to represent realistic experimental conditions are difficult because the inherent nonlinear dynamical behavior of such fluids is complicated by the highly non - linear equations of state ( eos ) used to describe real near - critical fluids .",
    "two computational approaches have been suggested for confined fluids in absence of convection . in one of them , which we will refer as the  thermodynamic approach \" @xcite , the piston effect is taken into account by a supplementary term @xmath2 , introduced in the heat conduction equation as follows , @xmath3 with @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the local fluid temperature , @xmath6 , the specific heat at constant volume ( pressure ) per unit mass , @xmath7 the local density and @xmath8 the thermal conductivity of the fluid .",
    "one can note that the term @xmath9 is only relevant near the critical point where @xmath10 .",
    "the fluid motions are neglected and the pressure @xmath11 , assumed to be homogeneous , is only a function of time @xmath12 . the pressure @xmath11 is determined from the fluid mass conservation and computed via the nonlinear expression @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the isothermal compressibility and @xmath15 the volume of the fluid sample .",
    "the resolution of ( [ pb ] ) requires an iterative procedure for each time step .",
    "this consists in calculating the temperature _ in the whole fluid volume _ using eqs .",
    "( [ hcond]-[g ] ) for some trial value of @xmath11 ( and thus @xmath16 ) and determining the other thermodynamic parameters ( @xmath7 , @xmath17 ) by an eos @xmath18 subsequent computation of the _ volume _ integrals in eq.([pb ] ) gives a new value of @xmath19 from which the pressure @xmath11 is corrected .",
    "the correction step is repeated until convergence .",
    "this approach has been extensively used by several groups @xcite in one - dimensional ( 1d ) calculation in conjunction with the restricted cubic eos @xcite and the finite difference numerical method .",
    "however , its extension to higher dimensions induces a large computational effort .",
    "first , it requires a sophisticated programming and , second , the computer resources rise steeply because the thermodynamic variables have to be evaluated at each grid point of the computational domain by means of the iterative procedure to solve eq .",
    "( [ pb ] ) .",
    "teams with expertise in theoretical hydrodynamics have developed a rigorous hydrodynamic approach @xcite in which the navier - stokes and energy equations are coupled with the eos .",
    "this set of equations has been solved analytically in 1d by asymptotic matching techniques @xcite and also by direct numerical simulation ( dns ) @xcite via the finite volume method @xcite both in 1d and 2d . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "the van der waals eos has been used in all these works .",
    "although this simple eos provides satisfactory qualitative results , accuracy can only be ensured by using a realistic eos . however , as shown in the present study , inserting a realistic eos into the hydrodynamic equations leads to a much more difficult computational task , which involves prohibitively large calculation times .",
    "for instance , to reach the final steady state in one of the 1d runs carried out for the cubic eos in the present study , one requires about two months on a 800 mhz pc .",
    "the purpose of this article is twofold .",
    "we first formulate an approximate method which is both simple and rapid ( e.g. , the same calculation cited above required only 20s ! ) and then compare it with the dns formalism .",
    "second , since this work is the first one to use a realistic eos for the dns , we describe in detail the hydrodynamic approach for the near - critical fluids with a general eos .",
    "we expect that this complete and unified description may be useful for the scientific community , as the hydrodynamic method is dispersed over many ( some of them not easily accessible ) publications .",

    "the method is based on the thermodynamic approach , i.e. on the energy equation  ( [ hcond ] ) .",
    "however , a different pressure equation will be used instead of eq .",
    "( [ pb ] ) .",
    "while the latter equation integrates over the fluid _ volume _ , we are looking for a pressure equation that integrates only over the _ boundaries _ of the fluid domain .",
    "such an equation would accelerate the iterative procedure",
    ". however , its advantage would not be decisive without an appropriate numerical method for eq .",
    "( [ hcond ] ) that should only require computation of the thermodynamic variables at the boundaries .",
    "such a numerical method is called boundary element method ( bem ) and is broadly used in heat transfer problems .",
    "the bem is expounded in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "several simplifications have to be introduced before presenting the formulation of the energy and pressure equations used in the present method . as stated in the introduction , we are mainly interested in the description of the early stages of the heating , i.e. on times of the order of the piston effect time scale @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the thermodynamic quantities @xmath20 are constant in the bulk of the fluid and only vary in the very thin hot and cold boundary layers .",

    "( [ hcond ] ) can be replaced by the spatially homogeneous time dependent values which will be denoted hereafter by an over - bar ( e.g. @xmath22 ) .",

    "we note that the density @xmath23 is constant as the system is closed .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to the statement that all these quantities should be calculated using the temperature value @xmath25 obtained from the eos for the pressure @xmath11 and the density @xmath23 .",

    "usually , the `` temperature step '' boundary condition has been applied for 1d problems .",
    "this heating process corresponds to a fluid cell , initially at a uniform temperature , which is submitted to a sudden increase of temperature at one of its boundaries , while the other is kept at the initial temperature ( dirichlet boundary conditions ) .",
    "this heating condition is physically unrealistic because the initial value for the heat flux at the heated boundary is infinite . instead ,",
