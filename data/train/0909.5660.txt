    "motivated by recent experiments that signal the emergence of novel quantum critical behavior in ferroelectrics  @xcite , we explore the possibility that transverse components of polar fluctuating phonons conspire to drive a first order displacive metaelectric transition and investigate the implications for the inverse susceptibility",
    ".    the soft - mode optical phonons in ferroelectrics can be well - described by a bosonic field theory .",
    "if the dynamics were not damped by free electrons and the interactions remain short - ranged then the general quantum critical behavior would adhere to the well - established rules reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , in ferroelectrics the motion of the atoms in optical modes leads to the emergence of electric dipoles .",
    "a good description of these long - range dipole forces is essential to properly describe the ferroelectric transition .",
    "the effect of long - range dipolar forces was first studied by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that anisotropies associated with the dipolar interaction led to a universality class in the classical ferroelectric .",
    "the quantum ferroelectric phase transition in the mean - field approximation , and its universality class , was studied by  @xcite .",
    "however , recent experimental evidence points to new physics that emerges close to quantum criticality ; for example the coexistence of a quantum paraelectric phase with a quantum ferroelectric phase in @xmath1o - exchanged srtio@xmath2 provides strong evidence for a first order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "additional motivation to study ferroelectrics arises from the inverse dielectric constant behavior of srtio@xmath2 which falls at low temperature before increasing as @xmath3 at intermediate temperatures and rises as @xmath4 at high temperature .",
    "one suggestion is that new phenomena are driven by the coupling of acoustic to optical phonons  @xcite .",
    "however , inspired by the ramifications of quantum fluctuations in ferromagnets  @xcite , we show that the transverse coupling of fluctuating phonons can drive a first order metaelectric transition .    having realized that fluctuations can cause the emergence of a first order transition it is natural to search for further phase reconstruction .",
    "motivated by the development of a textured fflo phase  @xcite , and evidence for a textured ferromagnetic state near to the ferromagnetic first order transition  @xcite , here we search for the emergence of an analogous textured ferroelectric phase . finally , to connect to prevailing experimental methods",
    ", we derive an appropriate expression for the inverse susceptibility that is consistent with recent experimental results  @xcite over a wide range of the phase diagram , and demonstrate that the transverse coupling of fluctuating phonons could cause it to have a characteristic minimum at low temperature .",
    "we adopt a bosonic field theory to describe the soft optical phonon modes that should recover the main physical behavior of the system .",

    "the terms @xmath21 and @xmath22 that describe the local anharmonic interactions give a net positive contribution which ensures that the polarization remains bounded . in general these parameters",

    "we note that whilst sweeping @xmath22 through @xmath34 with @xmath35 the first order rotation of polarization direction is accompanied with a continuous change in the magnitude of the polarization .",
    "this is driven by a similar mechanism to the blume - emery - griffiths model involving two bosonic fields  @xcite . within the mean - field approximation",
    "the condition for stability of the polarization is that the net coefficient of the quartic term is positive which translates to @xmath36 when @xmath29 and @xmath37 if @xmath32 .",
    "if these conditions are not fulfilled then higher order terms must be included and rather than undergo a second order transition at @xmath38 , the system might have a first order ferroelectric transition at mean - field level .",
    "we can neglect the higher order terms such as @xmath39 provided that the model remains stable , which requires that @xmath40 . here",
    "we wish to investigate whether near criticality the fluctuating modes can conspire to drive an otherwise second order transition to become first order . in order to access this behavior",
    "we now go beyond mean - field and consider the consequences of quantum fluctuations on the system .",
    "to account for fluctuation corrections to the system @xcite employed the renormalization group , which is tailored to study the well - established second order ferroelectric transition .",

    "this expression , except for the final fluctuation correction term , agrees with that of ref .",
    "@xcite , and is analogous to the coupling of transverse ferromagnetic fluctuations that led the emergence of first order behavior  @xcite .",
    "the condition for stability is the same as for the mean - field case .",
    "the momentum integrals are in general evaluated numerically .",
    "however , to further investigate the diagonal ordered phase we make the approximation that the cuboid brillouin zone boundary ( @xmath61 ) that bounds the momentum space integral can be replaced with a spherical boundary that encloses the same total phase space , so has radius @xmath62{6\\pi^{2}}$ ] . in the low temperature limit with the polarization aligned in the @xmath63 direction , the resulting integrals",

    "[ fig : phasediagram ] .",
    "the forbidden region indicates where the action polarizability and free energy would diverge without considering higher order corrections to the original action .",
    "when considered within the framework of mean - field phenomenology , here the system could undergo a first order paraelectric - ferroelectric transition .",
    "however , the corrections due to quantum fluctuations renormalize the action , causing a metaelectric boundary to peel away from the first order transition associated with the forbidden region .",
    "this metaelectric transition is consistent with recent experimental evidence for a first order phase transition  @xcite in @xmath1o - exchanged srtio@xmath2 . in both of the planes",
    "considered , the line of first order metaelectric transitions covers an extensive region of the phase diagram , terminating in a tricritical point at @xmath66 .",
    "the first order transition at small @xmath21 is destroyed at non - zero temperature , with the tricritical point moving up the line of transitions to @xmath67 .",
    "this critical behavior does not depend on the long - range dipole interactions since the lowest order term in @xmath19 and @xmath20 averages to zero on integrating over momenta  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath68 symmetry could be destroyed by applying a uniaxial electric field misaligned to the lattice .",
    "a further ramification of the quantum fluctuation corrections is that the rotation of the polarization from ising to diagonal order no longer occurs where @xmath22 turns negative .",
    "though , as for the mean - field case , the magnitude of the polarization is conserved ; fluctuations have renormalized the quartic terms and shifted the phase boundary in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram](b ) .",
    "this behavior can also be recovered by a renormalization group analysis @xcite .",
    "one experimental probe of the metaelectric transition is the changing behavior of the heat capacity @xmath69 . before the metaelectric transition ( small negative @xmath17 ) the relevant optic mode is `` soft '' and so the heat capacity follows the familiar debye form @xmath70 , whereas after the metaelectric transition ( large negative @xmath17 ) , the relevant optic modes are `` stiff '' and so the heat capacity has an exponential dependence on temperature . at high temperature , in both cases",
    "the heat capacity has the expected classical behavior @xmath71 .",
    "having confirmed the existence of a possible metaelectric behavior , we now turn to consider the stability of the phase in the vicinity of the transition .",
    "recent studies of itinerant ferromagnetism have suggested that such first order behavior can be preempted by the development of textured magnetic order analogous to that seen in the fflo phase of superconductors  @xcite .",
    "this leaves open the question as to whether a textured phase can develop in the vicinity of the metaelectric transition .",
    "our strategy to explore this possibility is to assume that the inhomogeneous phase is formed continuously , which allows us to develop a landau expansion in the polarization @xmath72 and texture wave vector @xmath73 .",
    "the onset of an inhomogeneous phase is signaled by the coefficient of the @xmath74 term turning negative . in our analysis",
    "we search primarily in the vicinity of the metaelectric transition at @xmath75 and consider a trial state with uniform polarization @xmath60 that is for simplicity superimposed by an inhomogeneous component @xmath76 .",
    "we then expand the free energy to quartic order in @xmath73 and discover that the presence of a textured phase makes a contribution to the total energy of @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "short of the first order transition where @xmath78 , the coefficient of @xmath79 is positive so the phase is not modulated . after the first order transition @xmath80 turns positive driving the coefficient of @xmath79 negative , revealing a finite @xmath81 instability in the region highlighted in  fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram](b ) .",
    "the modulation carries polarization @xmath82 . though the analysis is restricted to the consideration of a potential continuous transition into the textured phase , and a simple form for the texture , it is sufficient to validate its existence .",
    "refinements to include a putative first order transition or further textured phases would only enlarge the region of the phase diagram over which inhomogeneities could be observed .",
    "leaving aside potential textured phases we now turn to consider the behavior of the susceptibility across the phase diagram .",
    "the inverse susceptibility provides an experimental window  @xcite onto the quantum critical properties of ferroelectrics .",
    "deep in the paraelectric regime where @xmath83 , the contribution to the inverse susceptibility is @xmath84 , which is consistent with barrett s formula @xcite for a gapped system . in the quantum critical regime",
    "we see three characteristic types of behavior for the inverse susceptibility @xmath85 where the first term is from the diagonal contributions to eqn .  , and the latter two terms are the off - diagonal contribution , and @xmath86 . at low temperature effects of long - range dipole interactions",
    "prevail as the off - diagonal fluctuating contribution renormalizes the on - diagonal terms , with the linear temperature dependence of the term proportional to @xmath19 giving a positive slope to the inverse susceptibility whereas the @xmath87 term could provide a negative slope . at higher temperatures",
    "the @xmath88 contribution from the mean - field term dominates , which is also characteristic of quantum critical behavior and is in good agreement with recent experimental results  @xcite .",
    "we note that the @xmath88 behavior is recovered by other models , including a diagrammatic resummation  @xcite , the quantum spherical model  @xcite , renormalization group studies  @xcite , a self - consistent phonon model  @xcite , and an analogy to the temporal casimir effect  @xcite .",
    "the behavior has also been observed experimentally  @xcite . in both srtio@xmath2 and ktao@xmath2 the initial linear negative slope and",
    "the quadratic @xmath89 term conspire to cause a characteristic minimum in the inverse susceptibility . using estimates for the parameters in table  [ tab : srtio3params ] ,",
    "the minimum occurs at @xmath90 in both srtio@xmath2 and ktao@xmath2 which is in good agreement with the experimental values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively  @xcite",
    ". finally , at high temperatures a classical term @xmath93 from the longitudinal fluctuating term dominates from @xmath94 which is again in good agreement with the experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have found that the polar fluctuating phonons can drive a displacive ferroelectric through a first order metaelectric transition .",
    "long range dipolar interactions did not affect this critical phase behavior  @xcite . however , long - range dipole interactions introduced into the action through the term @xmath95 were pivotal in creating the correction to the inverse susceptibility @xmath96 that could explain the characteristic inverse susceptibility minimum  @xcite , as well as provide important corrections to the self - consistent phonon treatment  @xcite",
    ".    however , another mechanism , coupling of the soft optic modes to acoustic phonons could be significant .",
    "it has already been understood  @xcite that a coupling with the acoustic phonons @xmath97 of the form @xmath98 leads to a correction in @xmath99 of @xmath100 that could explain the characteristic minimum in the inverse susceptibility , and also has the capability of driving a first order transition  @xcite .",
    "this work and the results presented here motivate further experimental investigations into the inverse susceptibility and putative metaelectric transition that could shed light on the origin of the phase structure .",
    "though the coupling to acoustic phonons complicated the solid state system , ultracold atoms in an optical lattice with long - range dipole interactions  @xcite present a clean system that could provide a powerful tools to help unravel the properties of the generic hamiltonian .",
    "one important simplification was to model the ferroelectric with undamped dynamics .",
    "damping would primarily arise due to free electrons , which can be introduced controllably through doping .",
    "analogous to `` avoided criticality '' at a magnetic critical point which leads to non - fermi liquid behavior and superconductivity , ferroelectrics might also be expected to adopt novel behavior ; for example doped srtio@xmath2  @xcite , whereas undoped snte  @xcite and gete  @xcite become superconducting at low temperatures .",
    "this area presents a promising avenue of research .",
    "further open questions are to determine whether with just a change of parameters @xcite the same formalism be applied to order - disorder ferroelectrics , and to consider the consequences of the coupling of fluctuating polarization and magnetization that could arise in eutio@xmath2  @xcite ."
