    "<S> in lowest unique bid auctions , @xmath0 players bid for an item . the winner is whoever places the _ lowest _ bid , provided that it is also unique . </S>",
    "<S> we use a grand canonical approach to derive an analytical expression for the equilibrium distribution of strategies . </S>",
    "<S> we then study the properties of the solution as a function of the mean number of players , and compare them with a large dataset of internet auctions . </S>",
    "<S> the theory agrees with the data with striking accuracy for small population size @xmath0 , while for larger @xmath0 a qualitatively different distribution is observed . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this result as the emergence of two different regimes , one in which adaptation is feasible and one in which it is not . </S>",
    "<S> our results question the actual possibility of a large population to adapt and find the optimal strategy when participating in a collective game .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , statistical physics has provided powerful tools to study both equilibria @xcite and dynamical properties @xcite of games where the number of players is large . </S>",
    "<S> so far , most of the efforts in this field have been focused on games in which interactions among players are pairwise , the most notable and studied example being the prisoner s dilemma @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are many examples of collective games where a unique winner is singled out from a large population . in such cases </S>",
    "<S> , comparing theory with empirical data is particularly challenging : as the number of players increases , the statistical description becomes more appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> however , the complexity of the equilibrium strategy may also increase , thus making it more difficult for real agents to infer it from available information @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> online auctions provide a fertile , yet scarcely investigated ground for exploring this problem @xcite : the availability of large datasets provides a unique opportunity to study whether strategies of real players actually maximize their winning chances . here , we focus on lowest unique bid auctions . </S>",
    "<S> this game is interesting for two reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , it is sufficiently simple to allow for a comprehensive mathematical analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , many detailed auction records are freely available online . the game is formulated as follows : @xmath0 players can bid for an item of value @xmath1 . the bid must be a multiple of a minimum amount , so that one can effectively consider bid amounts as natural numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the winner ( if any ) is the player who places the lowest bid , which is unique , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ no other player bid on that amount . </S>",
    "<S> all players must pay a fee @xmath2 to take part in the auction ; additionally , the winner has to pay the bid amount .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we derive an explicit analytic expression for the symmetric nash equilibrium of the lowest unique bid auction and explore its dependence on the total number of players @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> to achieve an explicit solution we assume that @xmath0 is not fixed , but fluctuates according to a poissonian distribution , in analogy with the choice of the grand canonical ensemble in equilibrium statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare the expression with a large dataset @xcite where players are informed in advance of the total number of allowed bids @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a remarkable change in the data as @xmath0 increases : in the low @xmath0 regime ( fewer than @xmath3 players ) , the theory predicts very well the bid distribution . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the game is effectively a lottery , since winning chances are evenly spread on any number . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , in the large @xmath0 regime , the data deviate from the theoretical solution and rather follow an exponential distribution . here , players fail to adapt to the optimal strategy and the winning chances are highly dependent on the chosen number .    in a symmetric nash equilibrium , </S>",
    "<S> all players adopt the same strategy , and no player can benefit from changing strategy unilaterally , _ i.e. _ , should any of the players change strategy , his expected payoff would be equal or worse . consider @xmath0 individuals playing according to the same strategy @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the probability of bidding the number @xmath6 . then , the distribution of bids is multinomial : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the number of bids placed on each number @xmath6 . for convenience , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the generating function : @xmath9 we now assume that @xmath0 is not fixed , but fluctuates according to a poissonian distribution of mean @xmath10 , leading to a grand canonical generating function : @xmath11,\\ ] ] _ i.e. _ the number of bids on each number is also poisson distributed with mean @xmath12 . by differentiating @xmath13 with respect to @xmath14 , it is straightforward to compute the probabilities @xmath15 of @xmath6 being the winning number , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ that there is a unique bid on @xmath6 and no unique bids on lower numbers : @xmath16 it is also useful to compute the probability @xmath17 of @xmath6 being a potential winning number , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ that there are no bids on @xmath6 and no winners on lower numbers : @xmath18 we note that the probability of each bid to be a winner on a given number , @xmath19 , is equal to the probability , @xmath17 , of numbers to be potential winning numbers , which is a peculiar property of poisson games @xcite .    the expected payoff for a player bidding @xmath6 will be @xmath20 . at equilibrium , the expected payoff should be independent of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , players could benefit from bidding on numbers with high payoffs more frequently . imposing this condition leads to a recurrence relation for the average bidding frequencies </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21    to avoid a negative number of bids , the support of the distribution must be limited to the region where all @xmath22 s are positive . in this region @xmath23 holds , so that the @xmath22 s are strictly decreasing . </S>",
    "<S> the initial condition @xmath24 has to be determined iteratively from the condition @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> if the frequencies @xmath22 tend to zero for values of @xmath6 much smaller than the value of the item @xmath1 ( a condition that is always fulfilled in our dataset , and will be consistently assumed in the following ) , the last term in ( [ recurs ] ) can be disregarded . in this limit ( formally corresponding to @xmath26 ) </S>",
    "<S> the recurrence relation has been derived in @xcite and it is well defined for all values of @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> we extend this solution by noting that the normalization condition @xmath28 implies an explicit expression of @xmath24 : eq . [ recurs ] </S>",
    "<S> can be written as @xmath29 , which summed over @xmath6 yields the initial condition @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for an explicit expression for any specific @xmath22 s by iteration . substituting the solution into ( [ wkeq ] ) </S>",
    "<S> also shows that the average chance of winning of each bid is equal to @xmath31 , which is also equal to the chance of having no winner in the auction .    before discussing the comparison with the data , we briefly study some properties of the nash equilibrium distribution . when @xmath32 , a continuous approximation of ( [ recurs ] ) shows that @xmath22 decreases logarithmically with @xmath6 . for small @xmath33 , one can approximate @xmath34 , showing that the distribution has a super - exponential cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling of the value @xmath35 , around which the cutoff occurs , can be estimated in the following way . by removing all the players that bid on @xmath36 we change the average number of players by the amount @xmath24 giving @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to shifting the whole distribution by one along the @xmath6 axis , resulting in @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling transformation in the continuum limit becomes @xmath39 , with the solution @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the logarithmic integral and @xmath42 is a constant of @xmath43 .    </S>",
    "<S> .[fig1],width=317 ]    we now move to the comparison of the equilibrium solution with empirical data from the website @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dataset includes @xmath44 online auctions from april 2007 to january 2011 with a variable number of bids ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of allowed bids in a particular auction is announced before bidding starts , and the auction closes when this number is reached . </S>",
    "<S> each player is allowed a limited number of bids . </S>",
    "<S> the average number of bids per player in the full dataset is only @xmath47 and very weakly dependent on @xmath0 . in _ supplementary information _ , we demonstrate with agent based simulations that allowing a small number of multiple bids per player do not alter significatively the equilibrium strategy . for this reason , in the subsequent analysis we will neglect the effect of multiple bids by the same player and treat the bids as statistically independent .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we compare the theoretical and empirical bidding frequencies in different auctions having different numbers of players and different item values . in order to make the histograms smoother , we averaged each panel over @xmath48 different auctions having similar numbers of players and same item value ( shown in the figure ) .    on the fine scale of single numbers , </S>",
    "<S> the data show a structure dictated by known psychological effects . </S>",
    "<S> players tend to favor odd numbers over even numbers . some specific numbers ( like @xmath49 and other primes ) </S>",
    "<S> are perceived to be ` original ' by some players , and are chosen with significantly larger probability than neighboring ones .    on a coarser scale , the agreement between theory and data is striking for smaller auctions ( _ i.e. _ fewer than 200 players , panels a and b of fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is particularly remarkable that the empirical histograms reproduce the sharp cutoff , considering the non - trivial dependence of @xmath50 on the number of players .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , players should adjust their bidding strategies according to the number of players rather than the item value , which can be assumed to be infinite . in all auctions in the dataset , </S>",
    "<S> the cutoffs of the corresponding theoretical distributions occur at bid values much smaller than the item values ( shown in panels ) . to test whether the empirical bidding distributions are independent of @xmath1 , panel e </S>",
    "<S> compares two sets of auctions with the same number of players , but with item values that differ by a factor of three . </S>",
    "<S> the bidding distribution for the pricey item have a slightly heavier tail , but overall the distributions are very similar .    </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between theory and data progressively deteriorates as the number of players increases ( see panel c and d ) . for a large number of players ( more than @xmath51 ) </S>",
    "<S> an exponential distribution fits the data better , as shown in the lower panels of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by arguing ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that players having incomplete information about the game play according to a strategy defined as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the expected payoff when placing a bid @xmath6 and @xmath54 quantifies the degree of uncertainty about the game . </S>",
    "<S> if players have poor knowledge about the optimal strategy , they could assume a uniform prior probability to win on each @xmath6 , resulting in @xmath53 decreasing linearly with @xmath6 due to the cost of the bid when winning . </S>",
    "<S> substituting this prior into the logit strategy yields a strategy exponentially decreasing with bid size .     </S>",
    "<S> distance between the theoretical solution and the empirical histogram for each auction . </S>",
    "<S> the continuous line is the theoretical expectation @xmath55 if all bids for each histogram were randomly drawn for the theoretical distribution.[fig2],width=317 ]    a quantitative measure of how the data deviate from theory is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , where , for each auction , we plot the @xmath56 distance @xmath57 between the theoretical probability distribution and the empirical one , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the number of bids on @xmath6 in a given auction . if bids were randomly drawn from the theoretical distribution , the expected distance would decrease with the number of players as @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> empirically , the distances have a large spread around the expected value for small auctions and are consistently larger than expected for @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this outcome can not be simply explained by the larger number of auctions for smaller @xmath0 : as a consequence of players turnover , the distributions at fixed @xmath0 do not evolve with time in a significant way , as we checked by comparing older to more recent auctions .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting quantity is the distribution of actual winning numbers . at equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> , it should be equal to the distribution of bids . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , the empirical distribution of winning numbers supports this feature . </S>",
    "<S> the vast majority of winning numbers fall within the theoretical cutoff ( pink shaded area of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) . in the figure </S>",
    "<S> , we also show the analytical estimate @xmath62 based on the asymptotic expansion of the logarithmic integral . </S>",
    "<S> the black line is the average winning number , which in the relevant range , scales approximately in the same way as the cutoff .    . </S>",
    "<S> panel b : average and standard deviation of the winning numbers , compared with the respective theoretical lines . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3],width=317 ]    binning the data yields average winning numbers in excellent agreement with the theory , even for large @xmath0 where the empirical distribution of bids departs from the theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , the variance of winning numbers becomes much smaller than the theoretical prediction for @xmath63 . to further explore this phenomenon , </S>",
    "<S> we compute the actual probabilities to win on a certain number , given the empirical distributions of bids for auctions of various sizes . </S>",
    "<S> this probability is given by @xmath19 which , since @xmath64 , is the same as the probability to win on a certain number for an additional player entering the game . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] for the same examples considered in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . for auctions with few players , </S>",
    "<S> the largest chance of winning is not more than @xmath65 times higher than @xmath66 , the winning probability at the nash equilibrium . in this region , </S>",
    "<S> the game is not very different from a lottery , as the winning chances do not depend much on the chosen number @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for large auctions , the winning chances on low and high numbers are very small , while intermediate bids may have a winning chance more than @xmath68 times higher than the average bid in the nash equilibrium , providing opportunities for exploitation and thus potential room for adaptation .    . </S>",
    "<S> black lines are the same empirical data as panels a - d of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> gray ( red online ) lines are the relative probabilities to win when betting on @xmath6 given that all other players bid according to the empirical distribution . </S>",
    "<S> to help the comparison , we have renormalized the winning probabilities , @xmath17 , with their value for the nash equilibrium @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the shaded points mark the actual winning bids for each auction ( arbitrary y - position ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4],width=317 ]    summarizing , in this letter we derived the analytical equilibrium bidding distribution for the lowest unique bid auction and compared it with empirical data . </S>",
    "<S> the emerging picture is that players are able to infer the optimal strategy with striking accuracy when the number of players @xmath0 is not too large . in the large @xmath0 regime , </S>",
    "<S> the population - level strategy is highly non - optimal and it seems to be determined by the simple principle of not assuming a particular preference for any number while avoiding the cost of large bids .    </S>",
    "<S> this result raises non - trivial questions about the effectiveness of adaptive dynamics in collective games . while it has been studied whether adaptation eventually drives the system to the optimal solution or generates more complex dynamical behaviors @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> it is also crucial to assess _ how fast _ the equilibrium is reached . </S>",
    "<S> a thorough study of adaptive dynamics in such system will be the subject of a future study ; in _ supplementary information _ , we show that indeed , in the simple case of replicator dynamics , adaptation becomes slower at larger @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> . such slowdown could prevent the inference of the equilibrium strategy for large populations in realistic time - scales , and thus explain the increasing lack of adaptation in our data as @xmath0 grows .    </S>",
    "<S> we acknowledge useful discussions with m. marsili , k. sneppen , c. strandkvist and p. kempson . </S>"
