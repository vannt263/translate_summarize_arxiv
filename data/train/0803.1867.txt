    "many cases of the question of divergence of rays are already known .",
    "it is a general principle that the asymptotic behavior of the ray is determined by the properties of the vertical foliation of @xmath9 .",
    "the first instance is if the quadratic differentials @xmath12 defining the geodesic rays @xmath6 are strebel differentials .",

    "the next possibility is the vertical foliations of @xmath12 are topologically equivalent , have a minimal component and yet are not uniquely ergodic .",
    "( it is well - known that for any quadratic differential , the vertical trajectories decompose the surface into cylinders and subsurfaces in which every trajectory is dense ) . in that case in each minimal component there exist a finite number of mutually singular ergodic measures , and any transverse measure is a convex combination of the ergodic measures .",
    "ivanov ( @xcite ) showed that if the transverse measures of @xmath12 in these minimal components are absolutely continuous with respect to each other , then the rays stay bounded distance apart . in this paper",

    "this is where we use the assumption that the measures are not absolutely continuous with respect to each other .",
    "we will then apply lemma  [ vertical ] to find a bounded length curve @xmath39 which is `` mostly vertical '' with respect to the metric of @xmath35 .",
    "it has comparable length in the metric of @xmath36 .",
    "using the fact that the quadratic differentials give comparable length to @xmath40 while giving very different areas to @xmath41 , lemma  [ area ] will allow us to show that the ratio of the extremal length of @xmath40 along one ray to the extremal length on the other is large .",
    "we then apply kerckhoff s formula to conclude that the surfaces are far apart in teichmuller space",
