    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the vicinity of the pleiades is a rich environment for the study of processes that result from the interactions between stellar photons and the gas and dust clouds of interstellar space .",
    "the stars of this cluster were not formed out of the surrounding material visible as reflection nebulosity .",
    "rather , the spatial association of the stars and the interstellar gas is the result of a chance encounter between the cluster and one or more approaching clouds ( white 2003 ) .",
    "such collisions precipitate numerous radiative processes including the photoionization of atomic and molecular species , the photodissociation of molecules such as ch and h@xmath5 , and the photoelectric heating of diffuse gas by dust grains stimulated by ultraviolet radiation , all of which may help to explain some peculiarities of the ism near the pleiades .",
    "two such peculiarities are the great strength of ch@xmath0 absorption lines observed toward many cluster members ( white 1984__a _ _ ) and the large amount of h@xmath5 in rotationally excited states ( spitzer , cochran , & hirshfeld 1974 ) .",
    "while these anomalies may be related , a rigorous chemical model of ch@xmath0 production in the pleiades , and elsewhere in the ism , remains to be developed .",
    "ch@xmath0 is unable to form at the low temperature of diffuse clouds because the reaction leading to its formation , c@xmath0 + h@xmath5 @xmath8 ch@xmath0 + h , is endothermic with an activation energy of @xmath9 k. elitzur and watson ( 1978 , 1980 ) showed that the above reaction can produce sufficient amounts of ch@xmath0 if the gas is heated by an interstellar shock .",
    "however , subsequent observations failed to detect a corresponding overabundance of oh molecules resulting from a similar endothermic reaction ( federman et al .",
    "1996__a _ _ ) .",
    "several groups ( draine & katz 1986 ; pineau des forts et al .",
    "1986 ) employed magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) shocks to lessen the problem with the overproduction of oh , but even their models yielded oh column densities in excess of observations .",
    "the velocity shifts between ch and ch@xmath0 absorption lines predicted by these shock models have also not been detected ( e.g. , gredel , van dishoeck , & black 1993 ) .",
    "alternate theories for a non - thermal origin of ch@xmath0 have since been proposed .",
    "federman et al . ( 1996__b _ _ ) considered the motions of c@xmath0 ions influenced by the passage of alfvn waves against a static background of cold neutral gas .",
    "their model predicts ch@xmath0 , ch , and oh column densities in line with observations , but requires an additional mechanism to account for observed hco@xmath0 abundances .",
    "more recently , non - equilibrium chemistry was investigated by joulain et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and falgarone et al .",
    "these authors ascribe the transient heating of localized regions of the cold diffuse medium to intermittent bursts of turbulent dissipation by either mhd shocks or coherent small - scale vortices .",
    "such models may be appropriate for many galactic sight lines , yet the observational evidence in the pleiades favors heating either by h@xmath5 dissociation or by dust photoelectron emission , rather than shocks , as the agent responsible for ch@xmath0 formation ( white 1984__b _ _ ) .",

    "the earlier investigation by white ( 1984__a _ _ ) , comprising spectra for 15 pleiades members , analyzed interstellar absorption from the above atomic and molecular species , but the moderate velocity resolutions ( @xmath2 3@xmath298 km s@xmath3 ) allowed detections of only one component per sight line .",

    "the full analysis of these data ( white 2003 ) revealed considerable complexity and star - to - star variation in the atomic gas traced by neutral sodium , leading to an extensive spatial schematic of cloud - cluster interactions in which two clouds were presumed to be interacting with the uv radiation field of the pleiades and also with each other .",
    "one of the primary motivations for the present investigation was to obtain equally high quality data for the other important optical tracers of the ism toward a large number of targets in the pleiades so that a complete picture of the interaction between interstellar gas clouds and the stars of the cluster may be constructed .    in this paper , high - resolution , high signal to noise observations of cn , , , ch@xmath0 , and",
    "ch toward 20 pleiades members allow us to study cloud - cluster interactions and the implications for the chemistry of the local ism with a precision unmatched by previous investigations .",

    "we examine / column density ratios in  4.2 and derive physical conditions in  4.3 . in  5 , we interpret our findings in light of the conceptual schematic of cloud - cluster interactions offered by white ( 2003 ) and summarize our principal results in  6 .",
    "we observed 20 stars in the pleiades using the high - resolution mode ( cs21 ) of the 2dcoud spectrograph ( tull et al .",
    "1995 ) on the harlan j. smith 2.7 m telescope at mcdonald observatory in january , 2002 .",
    "the choice of sight lines came from the list in white et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , from which only those stars with secure membership in the pleiades cluster were included in our survey .",
    "stellar and observational data for the stars in our sample appear in table 1 . specifically , the hd number , name , spectral type , reddening , @xmath30 magnitude , equatorial coordinates ( j2000 ) , distance , and total exposure time on each star are presented .",
    "the spectral types and @xmath31(@xmath32 ) values come from white et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , while the @xmath30 magnitudes and equatorial coordinates were obtained from the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "it is most appropriate to list @xmath30 magnitudes because our instrumental setup had a central wavelength near 4000  .",
    "the parallax for each star was obtained from _ hipparcos _ measurements ( perryman 1997 ) , when available , and used to calculate the distance given in table 1 .",
    "additional information on the program stars is available from table 2 of white et al .",
    "for reference , figure 1 shows the distribution of observed sight lines in the pleiades centered on @xmath20 tau .",
    "the cross - dispersed echelle spectrometer of the 2dcoud spectrograph was configured in a manner identical to that described by pan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for their mcdonald observatory spectra . when combined with a 2048 @xmath33 2048 ccd , this configuration made possible the search for interstellar absorption from many species with a single exposure .",
    "in particular , the spectral coverage allowed for the detection of absorption features from cn near 3874  ,  k at 3933  , @xmath344226 , ch@xmath35 @xmath344232 , and ch @xmath344300 .",
    "each star was observed at least twice with a maximum exposure time of 30@xmath36 per frame to minimize the effect of cosmic rays .",
    "calibration exposures for dark current were obtained the first night of the run , while exposures for bias - correction and flat - fielding were taken each night and th - ar comparison spectra were obtained every 2 to 3 hours . by measuring the width of thorium emission lines in the comparison spectra , the resolution for these observations is determined to be about 1.7 km s@xmath3 , equivalent to a resolving power of @xmath37 .",
    "standard iraf routines were used for bias - correction , cosmic - ray removal , and flat - fielding of the raw image data .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted from the processed images and were calibrated in wavelength using the th - ar comparison spectra and then doppler - corrected . in regions where interstellar absorption lines were expected ,",
    "individual spectra were cut from each stellar exposure with sufficient continua on both sides , typically 2  .",
    "all spectra for the same species toward the same star were summed to yield a higher signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in the final spectrum .",
    "the snrs obtained in this way yielded 3-@xmath38 upper limits of about 2 m  on cn absorption and about 1 m  above 4000  .",
    "further details concerning the many steps in the data reduction process can be found by consulting pan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , with the caveat that no smoothing or additional processing was performed on the data presented here .",
    "stellar spectra were normalized to unity by fitting legendre polynomials , of the lowest possible order , to regions free of interstellar absorption .",
    "this process proceded without complication except in the case of hd 23964 .",
    "the spectra for all of our targeted species toward this star showed strong stellar features near the position of the expected interstellar lines . for  k",
    ", we were able to normalize the stellar feature because of the strength of the interstellar lines and their location away from the core of the stellar profile .",
    "but for cn , , ch@xmath35 , and ch , the stellar features could not be removed by normalization .",
    "figures 2@xmath294 present the final normalized spectra for  k , ch@xmath35 , and ch , respectively .",
    "the panels are arranged to approximate the spatial relationship among sight lines so that a comparison might be made of absorption profiles in different regions of the cluster ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . figure 5 presents the final normalized spectrum for cn absorption toward hd 23512 , the only sight line in our sample with a detectable amount of this molecule . because , no absorption ( stronger than @xmath2 1 m ) is detected along any of the observed sight lines , the spectra for this species are not given .",
    "these negative results are not unexpected considering the survey of by welty , hobbs , & morton ( 2003 ) which found predominantly quite weak lines .",
    "the resolution and signal to noise of our observations were high enough to allow the detection of multiple components of  k and ch@xmath0 and to permit the first positive detections of cn and ch toward a few of the observed stars .",
    "the lines were relatively weak , enabling us to fit simple gaussians to the components , yielding values for the equivalent width ( @xmath39 ) , radial velocity in the local standard of rest ( @xmath4 ) , and full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) for each component .",
    "the doppler parameter ( @xmath1-value ) was obtained from the measured line width ( fwhm ) , corrected for the instrumental width determined from thorium emission lines in the th - ar spectra .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath39 were derived from the rms variations in the normalized continuum and the width of the line for a specific component .",
    "they do not include errors in the placement of the continuum , but this is assumed to have a negligible effect .",
    "when no component was detected , 3-@xmath38 upper limits were calculated by adopting a typical width for the species in question .",
    "subsequent profile synthesis including @xmath40-doubling for the ch features yielded no significant change in fitted @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the analysis of this paper rests solely on the results of our gaussian fits .",
    "the moderately complex component structures of the  k and ch@xmath0 absorption profiles were constrained by the derived @xmath1-values .",
    "in general , no component narrower than 0.4 km s@xmath3 or broader than 2.5 km s@xmath3 was accepted , where the upper limit to @xmath1 is 1.5 times the mean value for found by pan et al .",
    "we note that this restriction plays at most a minor role in the component analysis . in some cases",
    ", it was necessary to compare the velocity of a ch@xmath0 component to that of  k to determine its legitimacy . as discussed in some detail in pan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , because is the most widely distributed of the observed species , if any other species has a component at a particular @xmath41 , then should also have a component at that velocity . based on our resolution ,",
    "an agreement within 1.5 km s@xmath3 was deemed adequate .",
    "the final component structure for a given line of sight resulted from using the fewest number of components , subject to the above criteria , which adequately fit the observed profile and left the residuals indistinguishable from the noise in the continuum .",
    "naturally , this approach presumes that the velocity structure along a line of sight is constant across species . to test this assumption ,",
    "we computed the difference between the velocities found for associated ch@xmath0 and components , @xmath42(ch@xmath43 ( ) . the average difference in velocity for components detected in both species is + 0.3 km s@xmath3 . to the extent that this result is comparable to the estimated uncertainty ( @xmath44 0.2@xmath290.3 km s@xmath3 )",
    ", we can be reasonably assured that our fits reveal the true component structure for a given line of sight .",
    "km s@xmath3 and @xmath45 km s@xmath3 on this scale , respectively .",

    "the larger value we obtain for this species ( 1.6 @xmath10 0.1 km s@xmath3 ) may have implications for the environment responsible for the formation of these lines .",
    "previous studies have shown that ch can exist in both low - density gas ( @xmath64 @xmath7 ) where it is produced via non - thermal ch@xmath0 chemistry ( draine & katz 1986 ; zsarg and federman 2003 ) , and in higher - density regions ( @xmath65 @xmath7 ) where cn resides ( federman et al .",
    "ch components associated with ch@xmath0 can be identified by a broad `` ch@xmath0-like '' absorption profile , whereas those found in regions where cn is detected will exhibit a sharper `` cn - like '' profile ( lambert , sheffer , & crane 1990 ) . in the analysis of pan et al .",

    "the ch components examined in the pleiades are more closely associated with ch@xmath0 than along average sight lines .",
    "indeed , our mean ch @xmath1-value is nearly indistinguishable from our mean value for ch@xmath0 and well above the @xmath1-values of the only detected cn lines ( 0.5 and 0.6 km s@xmath3 for r(0 ) and r(1 ) , respectively , toward hd 23512 ) . toward most of the pleiades , therefore , ch is found to be ch@xmath0-like as opposed to cn - like .",
    "that is , ch is linked to the formation of ch@xmath0 rather than cn and traces lower - density interstellar clouds .",
    "this conclusion would not be altered had we considered @xmath40-doubling in the ch line , which would lower our ch @xmath1-values by @xmath66 km s@xmath3 .",
    "table 5 also presents the mean radial velocities of the various species weighted by the column density of each component .",
    "these quantities yield information on the bulk kinematic properties of the various constituents of the interstellar gas near the pleiades .",
    "the column - density weighted mean velocity for in our sample is @xmath2 + 6 km s@xmath3 , whereas for molecular species this average is closer to @xmath2 + 9 km s@xmath3 . if only positive velocity components are included , the mean velocity increases to @xmath2 + 7 km s@xmath3 .",
    "white ( 1984__a _ _ ) was first to note the kinematic separation of atomic and molecular gas in this cluster .",
    "his results yielded average velocities of @xmath2 + 7 km s@xmath3 for and @xmath2 + 8 km s@xmath3 for ch@xmath0 .",
    "the distinction may even be more pronounced in the average velocities reported here especially considering our measurements of ch and cn velocities .",
    "the components ( white et al . 2001 ) have a weighted mean velocity of @xmath2 + 8 km s@xmath3 in somewhat closer agreement with the molecular species than with , suggesting that ionized and neutral gas may also be kinematically distinct . in the following section ,",
    "the bulk motions described above are examined in greater detail by identifying individual velocity components present in the atomic and molecular gas .",
    "in order to analyze the complex interactions between the interstellar gas and the stars of the pleiades and to attempt to map the extent of the clouds involved in these interactions , contour maps were generated showing the spatial distribution of individual velocity components for species with detectable absorption along more than one line of sight .",
    "these maps are presented in figures 6@xmath298 for ch , ch@xmath0 , and in order of increasing complexity .",
    "the contours in these figures were drawn by eye to include all sight lines which exhibit a given component . however , since we only have information at a limited number of discrete points , unlike radio data for instance , the boundaries shown are approximate at best . as a rule ,",
    "if a component was found along one sight line but not along another adjacent to it , a boundary was drawn half way between .",
    "when no sight line was available to constrain the outer portions of a given component , contours were drawn to the edge of the plot .      for the molecular species , ch and ch@xmath0 ,",
    "one component was typically found per absorbing sight line , falling in either of two categories , those with @xmath4 @xmath2 + 7 km s@xmath3 and those with @xmath4",
    "@xmath2 + 9.5 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the former correspond to the `` central '' component in the profiles analyzed by white ( 2003 ) who identifies this absorption with the pervasive foreground gas thought to be associated with the taurus dust clouds ( see also white & bally 1993 ) .",
    "the latter , also detected in the data , are termed the `` red '' component by white ( 2003 ) who suggests that this is either taurus gas redshifted to higher radial velocities by the interaction with cluster stars or an independent gas cloud also interacting with the pleiades . in our data , the strongest molecular absorption , including the only absorption detected in cn , is associated with the higher - velocity component .",
    "the lower - velocity gas is more pervasive and the two components generally occupy different regions of the cluster .",
    "figure 6 clearly illustrates the spatial distinction between 7 km s@xmath3 and 9.5 km s@xmath3 gas in the velocity components of ch and demonstrates the trend in absorption strength as well .",
    "there are five weak components with a mean velocity of + 6.9 km s@xmath3 concentrated in the central region of the cluster .",
    "four of these have column densities below @xmath67 @xmath61 and the fifth , toward hd 23568 , has a column density of @xmath68 @xmath61 .",
    "a much stronger component , with @xmath69 @xmath61 , is detected at a velocity of + 9.8 km s@xmath3 toward hd 23512 .",
    "the sight line to hd 23512 passes through a small molecular cloud first mapped in co emission by r.s .",
    "cohen ( 1975 , unpublished ; see federman & willson 1984 ) .",
    "the asterisk in figure 6 marks the position of peak co emission from the cloud .",
    "federman and willson published cohen s co data and added additional radio observations of co and @xmath70co , as well as ch and oh , determining the velocity of the cloud to be about 10 km s@xmath3 . our velocity for the ch component toward hd 23512 is consistent with their determination .",
    "in addition , the r(0 ) and r(1 ) lines of cn detected toward this star give velocities of + 9.4 and + 9.5 km s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "cn traces dense clouds and the extensive study by pan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that strong ch absorption is associated with cn ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that cn is only found along a sight line containing a molecular cloud and that the cn - like ch component in this direction has a consistent velocity .",
    "although the ch@xmath0 components in figure 7 exhibit more complexity in their spatial distribution , the general trends are still apparent .",
    "fourteen components are detected at a mean velocity of + 7.3 km s@xmath3 .",
    "these are distributed in mainly the central and eastern parts of the cluster , with some components extending to the south and to the west .",
    "the majority have column densities of @xmath71@xmath29@xmath72 @xmath61 .",
    "the higher - velocity components responsible for the largest column densities of ch@xmath0 are concentrated in the western half of the cluster .",
    "nine components are found at a mean velocity of + 9.3 km s@xmath3 and six of these have column densities greater than @xmath73 @xmath61 .",
    "the components toward 17 tau and 23 tau have the highest velocities of this group , + 10.3 and + 10.2 km s@xmath3 , respectively , noticeably higher than the velocity of any other component .",
    "these velocities coincide with the velocity of the molecular cloud discussed above and the sight lines toward these stars lie along the cloud s outer edge as seen in molecular emission ( federman & willson 1984 )",
    ". both are strong indications that the material responsible for the absorption originated in the molecular cloud .",
    "interestingly , no 7 km s@xmath3 gas is detected in the cloud s immediate vicinity ( toward hd 23512 ) but is seen in weak absorption to the north ( toward 17 tau and 23 tau ) and in more moderate absorption to the south ( toward hd 23410 ) .",
    "we do not detect any systematic velocity shifts between our ch and ch@xmath0 lines .",
    "the average difference in velocity for components detected in both species is @xmath42(ch@xmath43(ch@xmath74 km s@xmath3 .",
    "our ch velocities also agree well with those of , with an average difference for individual sight lines of @xmath42(ch@xmath75(@xmath76 km s@xmath3 .",
    "while the molecular data can be adequately represented by two distinct velocity components , the situation for is considerably more complex .",
    "up to five separate components are identified along a single line of sight . in all , 55 components are detected with velocities distributed almost continuously from + 3.1 to + 14.0 km s@xmath3 .",
    "another 10 are found with velocities between @xmath298.2 and @xmath293.7 km s@xmath3 .",
    "velocities alone are not enough to categorize components with such diversity .",
    "thus , the panels displayed in figure 8 were created by classifying the components not only according to their velocity , but also to their proximity to like sight lines and their overall position in the cluster .",
    "the notable features of this figure are as follows .",
    "the most pervasive group of components ( figure 8__e _ _ ) has a mean velocity of + 6.8 km s@xmath3 , clearly associating it with the central component of white s ( 2003 ) analysis and that found in our molecular data .",
    "this component pervades the observed extent of the cluster with the exception of five sight lines along the northern edge , 16 tau , 19 tau , 21 tau , hd 23568 , and hd 23873 . unlike the weaker molecular feature at this velocity ,",
    "the central component is the dominant source of atomic absorption in the pleiades with column densities ranging from @xmath77@xmath29@xmath78 @xmath61 .",
    "proceeding outward in velocity from the central component , there are two groups ( figures 8__d _ _ and 8__f _ _ ) which appear nearly identical in their morphology and spatial extent .",
    "these groups have mean velocities of + 5.5 and + 8.2 km s@xmath3 , respectively , and seem to populate the apparent void in the central component .",
    "indeed , all five of the aforementioned northern sight lines have components at both the slightly higher and slightly lower velocities .",
    "we interpret this bifurcation in velocity components , which appears smooth at our resolution , as evidence of a velocity gradient in the pervasive central cloud .",
    "however , the number of components belonging to groups 8__d _ _ and 8__f _ _ may be complicated by unresolved component blending in the central component ( 8__e _ _ ) .",
    "for example , welty et al . ( 1996 ) fit the asymmetric central region of their higher - resolution profile toward @xmath20 tau with two components with velocities of + 6.2 and + 7.7 km s@xmath3 , compared to our one component with a velocity of + 7.2 km s@xmath3 . in our data ,",
    "a hint of this asymmetry in the central region of the profile can be seen for @xmath20 tau , as well as for 27 tau and 28 tau . in general , though , the @xmath1-values for these three groups of components are quite similar ( @xmath79 km s@xmath3 ) and thus do not indicate that unresolved structure is a major concern .    moving out still further in velocity from the central component , we encounter two additional groups ( figures 8__c _ _ and 8__g _ _ ) with analogous spatial characteristics .",
    "these groups , with mean velocities of + 3.8 and + 9.4 km s@xmath3 , respectively , exhibit identical structure in the cluster s northwest quadrant , but the lower - velocity components ( 8__c _ _ ) are more extensive in the southeast .",
    "interestingly , the six sight lines that are missing from the feature in figure 8__g _ _ have components at even higher velocities ( figure 8__h _ _ ) . this group ( 8__h _ _ ) has a mean velocity of + 11.5 km s@xmath3 . taken together , the components in figures 8__g _ _ and 8__h _ _ are roughly comparable to the red component in white s ( 2003 ) classification scheme . those in figure 8__c _ _ correspond to what white ( 2003 ) terms the `` blue '' component , with the implication that gas from the central cloud at @xmath4 @xmath2 + 7 km s@xmath3 has been blueshifted by its interaction with the cluster to lower radial velocities .",
    "the spatial correlations and morphological similarities of redshifted and corresponding blueshifted components in figure 8 are striking and support the claim that velocity gradients reflect the interaction on a cloud .",
    "furthermore , the mean velocities found for the components of figures 8__c _ _ and 8__g _ _ differ from the mean velocities of the previous two groups ( figures 8__d _ _ and 8__f _ _ ) by an amount consistent with the velocity differences between those groups and the central component .",
    "in other words , figures 8__c _ _ through 8__g _ _ present successive velocity intervals of approximately 1.4 km s@xmath3 evincing the symmetry of the interstellar gas in the pleiades traced by absorption .",
    "the remaining panels of figure 8 present further components which do not conform to the above symmetries .",
    "the components with the most extreme positive velocities ( figure 8__i _ _ ) inhabit a region directly west of the cluster center .",
    "it is notable that the two sightlines showing this component , 17 tau and 23 tau with velocities of + 14.0 and + 13.7 km s@xmath3 , respectively , are the same as those with the highest ch@xmath0 velocities , although the actual velocities do not agree .",
    "the proximity of these highly redshifted components to the edge of the molecular cloud is suggestive of strong interactions between cloud material and the luminous blue giants .",
    "figures 8__a _ _ and 8__b _ _ reveal the distribution of absorption detected at negative velocities .",
    "the six components concentrated in the central region of the cluster ( 8__b _ _ ) have a mean velocity of @xmath294.1 km s@xmath3 in close agreement with the negative - velocity components found in .",
    "white ( 2003 ) names this the `` shocked '' component , referring to the prediction that strongly blueshifted absorption features would arise in foreground gas shocked by the interaction with cluster stars .",
    "four additional shocked components are detected along the cluster s western edge ( 8__a _ _ ) .",
    "these have even more strongly blueshifted velocities with a mean of @xmath296.3 km s@xmath3 .",
    "white finds shocked components toward only hd 23410 , @xmath20 tau , 27 tau , and hd 23964 yet hints at unpublished data confirming additional detections toward 21 tau and 28 tau .",
    "we also detect shocked components toward 21 tau and 28 tau and add to this list 16 tau , 19 tau , 23 tau , and 24 tau .",
    "the shocked atomic components provide an important observational constraint when considering the types of interactions needed to explain the features of the interstellar medium in the pleiades .",
    ", comparable to our velocity resolution.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we performed a statistical analysis to determine whether binning the velocity components in figure 8 differently would severely alter our results . to this end , a series of histograms were constructed with successive bin sizes from 0.2 km s@xmath3 to 1.9 km s@xmath3 . in almost every case",
    ", four distinct peaks could be seen for the positive - velocity components , with another single peak evident for the components with negative velocity .",
    "a representative histogram is shown in figure 9 with a bin size of 1.4 km s@xmath3 , comparable to the resolution in our data .",
    "the peaks in the figure are centered about values of @xmath294.5 , + 3.9 , + 6.7 , + 9.5 , and + 12.3 km s@xmath3 , closely echoing the mean velocities found for the components in figures 8__b _ _ , 8__c _ _ ,",
    "8__e _ _ , 8__g _ _ , and 8__h _ _ , respectively . because variations in bin size have a negligible effect on the results presented in figure 8 , these features are not an artifact of a particular classification scheme , but represent physical structure in the interstellar atomic gas .",
    "the last column of table 4 displays the @xmath59()/@xmath59 ( ) ratios for our components common to the investigation of white et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and upper limits for components not detected in .",
    "figure 10 plots these ratios as a function of @xmath42 ( ) .",
    "routly and spitzer ( 1952 ) were first to demonstrate that the / column density ratios are inversely proportional to the velocity of the material .",
    "this phenomenon , known as the routly - spitzer effect , was later confirmed by siluk and silk ( 1974 ) , who found that the decrease in @xmath59()/@xmath59 ( ) was most evident for components with absolute velocities greater than @xmath2 20 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the routly - spitzer effect is generally attributed to variations in the gas - phase abundance of calcium in clouds at different velocities .",
    "calcium is depleted onto the surfaces of dust grains in low - velocity diffuse interstellar clouds resulting in high / ratios in these environments .",
    "heating from shock waves and cloud collisions in higher - velocity material can cause grain destruction which releases calcium back to its gaseous phase , yielding a lower / ratio .",
    "the data in figure 10 show an indication of this trend but there are not enough high - velocity detections to be certain .",
    "( na  i)/@xmath59(ca  ii ) ratios as a function of @xmath42(ca  ii ) . of the four data points with @xmath80 ,",
    "three have ratios less than one .",
    "these are for the shocked components toward @xmath20 tau , 27 tau , and hd 23964 .",
    "the fourth , with a ratio of @xmath2 2 , is for the shocked component toward hd 23410 .",
    "the lower limit near the top of the figure is for the + 9.2 km s@xmath3 component toward hd 23512.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    more importantly , because calcium depletion is assumed to be density - dependent , our / ratios can be used to characterize the physical conditions of the interstellar clouds responsible for the detected absorption , providing a test for our derived column densities .",
    "the majority of positive - velocity components in figure 10 have @xmath59()/@xmath59 ( ) of order a few to 10 , consistent with the values typical of diffuse , non - molecular clouds with densities of @xmath81 @xmath7 ( hobbs 1976 ) .",
    "the only exception to this is the + 9.2 km s@xmath3 component toward hd 23512 .",
    "the / ratio for this component ( the lower limit near the top of figure 10 ) is of order 100 , more characteristic of a denser , molecular cloud where calcium is depleted onto grain surfaces more effectively ( crawford et al .",
    "1989 ; crawford 1992 ) .",
    "in contrast , the + 6.2 km s@xmath3 component along this sight line has a ratio of @xmath2 10 placing it among the diffuse components where calcium depletion is less severe . since these results predict the proper relationship between velocity components and the expected physical characteristics of the associated clouds , it gives us confidence in the accuracy of our derived column densities .",
    "a conspicuous feature of figure 10 is that the / ratios for shocked atomic components ( those with @xmath82 ) are less than one except toward hd 23410 for which @xmath59()/@xmath59 ( ) @xmath2 2 . in the environment near the pleiades , a ratio less than one probably implies that photoionization from bright cluster stars has led to a reduction in neutral sodium .",
    "this effect would be less pronounced for gas near hd 23410 lying far from the more luminous stars and producing little luminosity of its own .",
    "the shocks themselves do not have high enough velocities to contribute much gas - phase calcium from grain processing .",
    "it is possible to extract the physical conditions of the interstellar medium near the pleiades directly from our absorption - line data . in this section ,",
    "we derive estimates for @xmath83 , the total gas density of the absorbing clouds , and @xmath84 , the enhancement of the uv radiation field due to cluster stars over the average galactic field , by adopting various models of diffuse - cloud chemistry .      for the majority of sight lines in our sample , ch is found to be closely associated with ch@xmath0 . in such environments , the total gas density , defined as @xmath85(h ) + @xmath86(h@xmath87 ) , may be obtained by studying the reactions which lead to the production of ch from ch@xmath0 . in the calculations that follow ,",

    "( 2005 ) , we obtained a value for the gas density of the pleiades molecular cloud toward hd 23512 .",
    "the model is appropriate for a diffuse cloud with large molecular content but does not include dark - cloud chemistry . as argued by federman & willson ( 1984 ) , the co column density from the densest , most opaque portion of the cloud , @xmath59(co@xmath132 @xmath61 , while larger than the values measured in diffuse gas , is significantly lower than those measured toward the centers of dark clouds .",
    "the pleiades cloud is not , therefore , an intermediate zone between diffuse and dark clouds but simply a much less opaque molecular cloud than is normally observed in the taurus region . using our measured ch and cn column densities toward hd 23512 and setting @xmath133 due to the position of this star almost a parsec distant ( in projected separation ) from the luminous cluster stars ,",
    "the model suggests @xmath134 @xmath7 .",
    "the original study by federman & willson ( 1984 ) predicted @xmath135 300@xmath29500 @xmath7 based on their @xmath70co data and the large velocity gradient model of goldsmith et al .",
    "bally and white ( 1986 , unpublished ; see white 2003 ) found a density of 300 @xmath7 within 10@xmath136 of the position of peak co emission and 800 @xmath7 at the position of the peak .",
    "the consistency of these densities with those derived by federman & willson ( 1984 ) leads us to conclude that our lower limit is in error , being a factor of two larger than even the above peak value . evidently , there is more cn along this line of sight than can be attributed solely to diffuse - cloud chemistry .",
    "the chemical reaction network common to dark clouds appears to contribute to cn production despite the unusually low density of this diffuse molecular cloud .",
    "in  4.1 , the relatively straightforward distribution of molecular gas in the pleiades as traced by the molecules of ch@xmath0 , ch , and cn is contrasted with the rather complicated structures seen in the ionized atomic gas traced by .",
    "the largest columns of molecular gas are associated with a velocity component at @xmath4 @xmath2 + 9.5 km s@xmath3 concentrated in the western region of the cluster .",
    "clearly , some of this material is related to the molecular cloud seen along the line of sight toward hd 23512 , particularly that detected in ch and cn absorption in this direction .",
    "indeed , the velocities of the ch and cn components here are consistent with the cloud velocity determined from molecular line emission by federman & willson ( 1984 ) and , although the density of the cloud derived from our ch and cn column densities ( @xmath134 @xmath7 ) is significantly larger than their predicted value ( @xmath2 300@xmath29500 @xmath7 ) , the inclusion of dark - cloud chemistry should correct this discrepancy . still , whether or not all molecular components that share the cloud velocity have a common origin remains elusive .",
    "the general conclusions of the expansive study by white ( 2003 ) favor a three body encounter in which gas associated with the taurus dust clouds and redshifted by the interaction with the pleiades accounts for some of the red components and a separate cloud approaching from the west and also interacting with the cluster accounts for others . in support of the latter ,",
    "the strongest components of ch@xmath0 absorption are located northwest of the cluster center , with a position and orientation similar to that of the western cloud described by white ( 2003 ) .",
    "the absence of any corresponding ch components in this region indicates the low density of the material .",
    "gas toward 17 tau and 23 tau with a velocity of + 10 km s@xmath3 likely probes the low - density envelope of the molecular cloud which lies just to the south of these sight lines .",
    "the rest of the ch@xmath0 components near + 9 km s@xmath3 may also trace this envelope , but the data do not preclude a connection with redshifted taurus material .    the other , weaker constituent of molecular gas in the pleiades has a velocity of @xmath2 + 7 km s@xmath3 , associating it with the central component of atomic gas and with the taurus clouds .",
    "all sight lines with detectable amounts of ch , except that toward hd 23512 , and the majority of ch@xmath0 sight lines exhibit this component .",
    "it is found in both species along sight lines to three stars in the center of the cluster ( @xmath20 tau , 27 tau , and 28 tau ) and these show similar ch / ch@xmath0 column density ratios ( 0.2 for @xmath20 tau and 0.1 for 27 tau and 28 tau ) . toward hd 23512 , where both species are detected at @xmath2 + 9.5 km s@xmath3 ,",
    "the ratio is much larger ( 0.9 ) . that the column densities of ch and ch@xmath0 are well correlated for the central component strengthens the claim that ch toward most of the pleiades is ch@xmath0-like .",
    "the larger ratio toward hd 23512 results from the addition of cn - like ch to the total ch column and reinforces the idea that this sight line effectively probes the molecular cloud .",
    "the patterns exhibited in the velocity components of ( figure 8) offer unique insight into the complex interactions between the ism and the stars of the pleiades .",
    "for instance , the central component at @xmath4 @xmath2 + 7 km s@xmath3 seen toward all of the stars in our survey does not have a uniform velocity across the cluster .",
    "the slight blueshifts and redshifts apparent in figures 8__d _ _ and 8__f _ _ , respectively , are a strong indication that a dynamical interaction is occurring in which cloud material passing through the uv radiation field of the cluster is deflected toward and away from our line of sight .",
    "that the pattern seems to repeat itself at larger and smaller velocities ( figures 8__c _ _ and 8__g _ _ ) suggests that the encounter of this central component can account for at least some of the observed red and blue components .",
    "gas detected at velocities higher than @xmath2 + 10 km s@xmath3 likely derives from multiple sources .",
    "the feature seen in figure 8__h _ _ may contain components missing from the gas in figure 8__g _ _ which have been further redshifted by cluster interactions , but may also contain independent components from a chance meeting with a second approaching cloud .",
    "the latter is the probable source of the extreme - velocity components in figure 8__i _ _ due to the proximity of these sight lines to the molecular cloud .",
    "the shocked atomic components in figures 8__a _ _ and 8__b _ _ show additional indications of a velocity gradient from the center of the cluster to the northwestern edge , despite the noticeable gap toward 17 tau , 20 tau , and 22 tau .",
    "in general , the various components of are more pervasive in number and extent than those in the analysis of observations by white ( 2003 ) , as expected if is the most widely distributed species as in figure 6 of pan et al .",
    "clearly , highly sensitive observations of can trace the intricate cloud - cluster and cloud - cloud interactions of the pleiades in greater detail and on a larger scale than observations of equal quality .",
    "an important result of our analysis of / ratios (  4.2 ) was that they predicted the proper relationship between velocity components and the expected physical conditions of the associated clouds , strengthening our confidence in the column densities derived from our observations .",
    "/ ratios of order a few to 10 were measured for most positive - velocity components indicating the diffuse nature of much of the interstellar gas near the cluster where calcium is not efficiently depleted onto the surfaces of dust grains . a ratio of order 100",
    "was observed in the + 9.2 km s@xmath3 component toward hd 23512 since this gas lies in a denser region near the molecular cloud , an environment which results in higher calcium depletion .",
    "final confirmation comes from the + 6.2 km s@xmath3 component toward this star whose / ratio of @xmath2 10 rightly places it among the diffuse components .",
    "the precise density estimates of  4.3 can place meaningful constraints on the chemical processes active in the diffuse clouds of the pleiades .",
    "a comparison of the values obtained from ch / ch@xmath0 column density ratios with those from rotationally excited h@xmath5 column densities offers particular insight .",
    "we find generally good agreement in the densities obtained from the two methods by adopting a molecular fraction of @xmath124 .",
    "this value of @xmath94 yields typical densities of @xmath137 @xmath7 , significantly below earlier predictions which favored densities between 100 @xmath7 ( gordon & arny 1984 ) and 400 @xmath7 ( white 1984__a _ _ , _ b _ ) .",
    "a possible discrepancy with our more precise estimates comes from the recent study by zsarg and federman ( 2003 ) who inferred a density upper limit of @xmath115 @xmath7 from the column densities of the fine - structure levels of toward @xmath20 tau .",
    "this determination is an order of magnitude lower than our value toward @xmath20 tau , @xmath125 @xmath7 , obtained from both ch / ch@xmath0 ratios and h@xmath5 rotational populations . yet , based on their density estimate , zsarg and federman ( 2003 ) predict a ch column density upper limit toward @xmath20 tau of @xmath59(ch ) @xmath138 @xmath61 , consistent with our measured value of @xmath139 @xmath61 . to derive this predicted column density , the authors incorporated non - thermal motions of ions and neutrals due to the propagation of alfvn waves in a transition zone between cloud and intercloud material ( federman et al .",
    "1996__a _ _ ) . without incorporating turbulence",
    ", the predicted column density along this sight line is @xmath59(ch ) @xmath140 @xmath61 , much lower than the measured value .",
    "non - thermal models hold great promise for diffuse - cloud chemistry , particularly in explaining the abundance of the ch@xmath0 radical as well as the abundances of molecules like ch which are tied to its formation .    the question remains , then , why the density predicted by zsarg and federman ( 2003 ) is so much lower than our value .",
    "two possibilities immediately present themselves .",
    "first , observations of h@xmath5 , ch , and ch@xmath0 may sample different cloud depths due to the stratification of molecular species along the line of sight .",
    "this scheme suggests that rotationally excited h@xmath5 molecules probe denser portions of the cloud closer to the stars , in the main portion of the photodissociation region ( pdr ) , where the uv radiation is strongest and is responsible for populating the higher @xmath116 levels through uv pumping .",
    "ch and ch@xmath0 , as well as , would then trace the less dense outer portions of the cloud away from the pdr .",
    "a major drawback to this scenario is it requires @xmath141 or higher to yield low enough densities from our measured ch / ch@xmath0 column density ratios to agree with the result , which would subsequently increase our h@xmath5-derived densities for this diffuse gas to greater than 400 @xmath7 , a value more typical of the pleiades molecular cloud .",
    "a more suitable alternative is that the fine - structure levels of trace regions of various extent along the line of sight .",
    "if the @xmath142 level , for instance , was confined to a region of space 1/10 the size of that occupied by the @xmath143 level , the density upper limit would be more in line with our determination .",
    "finally , the inclusion of time - dependent effects into a chemical model of ch@xmath0 formation may still prove to be important since the timescale for h@xmath5 dissociation is comparable to the characteristic time in which the cloud is interacting with the cluster . because the initiating reaction leading to ch production requires h@xmath5 , a decreasing presence due to photodissociation would demand a higher density to account for the observed columns of ch .",
    "such a requirement could be accommodated by our simple steady - state model by , again , raising slightly the value of @xmath94(h@xmath5 ) .",
    "the most general conclusion of this investigation is that detailed observations of both atomic and molecular species essentially confirm the scenario of cloud - cluster interactions constructed by white ( 2003 ) .",
    "a pervasive foreground gas cloud at @xmath4 @xmath2 + 7 km s@xmath3 seen toward nearly every star in both strong atomic and weaker molecular absorption is flowing through the cluster and dynamically interacting with the stellar uv radiation field .",
    "the clearly symmetric patterns of both blueshifted and redshifted components extending across the cluster demonstrate the large - scale nature of these interactions .",
    "a second cloud at @xmath4 @xmath2 + 10 km s@xmath3 is also likely to be interacting with the cluster due to the strong ch@xmath0 absorption near this velocity northwest of the cluster center and the existence of a diffuse molecular cloud also at @xmath4 @xmath2 + 10 km s@xmath3 to the southwest .",
    "high velocity components with no direct connection to redshifted foreground gas may also require the existence of a second interacting cloud .",
    "twenty stars in the pleiades were observed with high resolution and high signal to noise in a spectral range allowing for the detection of absorption features from cn ,  k , , ch@xmath0 , and ch .",
    "total equivalent widths are consistent with previous determinations except in cases where we detect weaker features owing to our greater sensitivity .",
    "mean @xmath1-values for cn , ch@xmath0 , and ch indicate that toward most of the pleiades ch is linked to the formation of ch@xmath0 rather than to cn chemistry .",
    "weighted mean velocities for individual species reveal a kinematic separation of atomic and molecular gas , with neutrals more closely associated with the latter . for the molecular species , two distinct velocity components are sufficient to characterize the observed profiles , with the sight line toward hd 23512 clearly probing the molecular cloud seen in this direction . considerably more structure is seen along lines of sight in the atomic gas traced by .",
    "velocity gradients are apparent in the pervasive central component implying a dynamical interaction with the cluster .",
    "density estimates from ch / ch@xmath0 column density ratios agree well with those based on the rotational excitation of h@xmath5 molecules for @xmath144h@xmath145 , yielding typical densities of @xmath137 @xmath7 for the ism near the pleiades .",
    "however , given the similar timescales of the relevant chemical and dynamical processes , the importance of time - dependent effects must be examined .    with the availability of high - quality absorption - line data for cn , , , ch@xmath0 , and ch provided by this investigation and for provided by white et al .",
