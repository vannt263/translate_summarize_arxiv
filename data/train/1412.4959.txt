    "<S> we present direct numerical simulations of the different two - dimensional flow regimes generated by a constant spatially periodic forcing balanced by viscous dissipation and large scale drag with a dimensionless damping rate @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the linear response to the forcing is a @xmath1 square array of counter - rotating vortices , which is stable when the reynolds number @xmath2 or @xmath3 are small . after identifying the sequence of bifurcations that lead to a spatially and temporally chaotic regime of the flow when @xmath2 and @xmath3 are increased , we study the transitions between the different turbulent regimes observed for large @xmath2 by varying @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a large scale circulation at the box size ( the condensate state ) is the dominant mode in the limit of vanishing large scale drag ( @xmath3 large ) . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath3 is decreased , the condensate becomes unstable and a regime with random reversals between two large scale circulations of opposite signs is generated . </S>",
    "<S> it involves a bimodal probability density function of the large scale velocity that continuously bifurcates to a gaussian distribution when @xmath3 is decreased further . </S>"
