    "the earth s geo - aerospace is continuously bombarded by high , very high and ultra high energy charged particles , which penetrate deep within the atmosphere .",
    "they are known as cosmic rays ( crs ) , consisting mostly of protons and @xmath0particles with small fraction of heavier nuclei @xcite .",
    "the majority of crs originate from the galaxy , called galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) with intensity varying by 1020@xmath1 modulated by solar wind and depending on the level of the solar activity .",
    "therefore , the flux of primary crs follows the 11-year solar cycle and responds to solar wind variations and transient phenomena @xcite .",
    "the earth is also hit sporadically by high intensity , but with low occurrence rate solar energetic particles ( seps ) , accelerated during explosive energy releases on the sun , which may sometimes produce an atmospheric cascade , leading to a ground level enhancement ( gle ) @xcite .",
    "primary cr particles penetrate into the earth s atmosphere and produce complicated nuclear - electromagnetic - muon cascade , which consists of large amount of secondary particles .",
    "in such a cascade , only a fraction of the initial primary particle energy reach the ground as secondaries , most of the primary particle s energy is released in the atmosphere by ionization @xcite . therefore cr particles of both galactic and solar origin significantly affect the radiation environment and accordingly exposure at typical commercial flight altitudes of about 35 kft ( 10 668 m above the sea level ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , gcrs and seps are the most significant contributors to the increased compared to the ground level radiation exposure of aircrew , specifically over the polar region , where the magnetospheric shielding is not as strong as at middle and equatorial latitudes .    according to the common definition",
    ", space weather refers to the dynamic , variable conditions on the sun , solar wind and earth s magnetosphere and ionosphere , that can compromise the performance and reliability of spacecraft and ground - based systems and can endanger human life or health .",
    "an important topic of space weather is the assessment of aircrew exposure due to cr , specifically during gles events @xcite .",
    "because the aircrews are subject to increased exposure , particularly during intercontinental flights over the pole due to the increased intensity of secondary crs , the radiation protection of aircrews became a subject of radiation protection regulations , namely publication 60 of the international commission on radiological protection @xcite , where the exposure of flying personnel to cosmic radiation is recommended to be regarded as occupational .",
    "accordingly in eu , the radiation protection of aircrew members , has been legally regulated in the eu since 1996 @xcite i.e. there is a suggestion of measures to assess the individual doses of both cockpit and cabin crew .",
    "those recommendations are spread on different timescales , from single flights , where exposure would be due to seps , to decadal exposure or even whole carrier exposure .    in order to mitigate those effects",
    "a detailed study is necessary , considering explicitly such features as anisotropy of seps , their spectral features as well as their time evolution during major solar proton events .",
    "the flux of primary crs , both of galactic and/or solar origin is influenced by the spatial - temporal variability of the complex magnetospheric and interplanetary conditions .",
    "in addition , the secondary particles in the cascade are characterized by large diversity as type ( hadrons such protons , neutrons and mesons , electromagnetic particles such as electrons , positrons and gammas , etc  ) , distributed in a wide energy range i.e. the radiation field is a complex mix of different particles possessing different radiation impact @xcite .",
    "therefore , the task to estimate the ambient dose equivalent , accordingly the air - crew exposure due to cr of galactic and solar origin is not trivial , since it depends on geographic position , altitude ( the distribution as intensity and energy of the secondary particles ) and solar activity @xcite .",
    "therefore the assessment of radiation dose hazard due to gcr and/or seps involves several consecutive steps . in the first step fluxes of gcr and seps",
    "must be precisely determined outside the magnetosphere .",
    "subsequently their propagation through the atmosphere and magnetosphere of the earth should be carefully modelled in order to derive a realistic information of the secondary cr flux .",
    "finally the secondary particle flux is converted to effective and/or ambient dose equivalent .",
    "it was shown that the dose rate can be computed as a function of the geomagnetic rigidity cut - off and altitude using a full monte carlo simulation of the atmospheric cascade @xcite .",
    "nowadays as a result of numerical methods , based on enhanced knowledge of high - energy interactions and nuclear processes , several models aiming to estimate the dose rate ( effective and/or ambient dose equivalent ) at flight altitudes due to primary cr radiation based on monte carlo simulations have been proposed @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we describe a numerical model to estimate effective and/or ambient dose equivalent at flight altitudes .",
    "the model uses nm data in order to derive the seps spectral and angular features .",
    "subsequently on the basis on newly computed yield functions for conversion of particle fluence to dose and using the derived spectra and angular characteristics as input we compute the effective dose and ambient dose equivalent .",
    "it is known that the dose rate can be computed as a function of the geomagnetic rigidity cut - off ( particularly for gcr and gle particles ) and altitude using a full monte carlo simulation of the atmospheric cascade and subsequent conversion of secondary particle flux to effective and/or ambient dose equivalent @xcite . here we are using a formalism based on pre - computed effective and ambient dose equivalent yield functions derived with extensive monte carlo simulation of primary cr particle induced atmospheric cascade .",
    "the formalism of pre - computed yield functions is well known , widely used and easy for application . thus , the yield functions computed once using very high statistics allow one to achieve very high precision , specifically in the high - energy part of the spectrum and to avoid subsequent extensive computations once the yield function is computed .",
    "the effective dose and/or the ambient dose equivalent in any particular case are obtained as an integral of the product of the primary particle spectrum and the pre - computed yield functions .    for the assessment of spectral and angular characteristics of seps we are using data from the global nm network ( fig.1 ) and convenient optimization procedure ( see bellow subsection ii.a ) .    [ !",
    "ht ]      the spectral and angular characteristics of seps using the information retrieved by ground based neutron monitors would be estimated using the relationship between the nm count rates and the primary particle flux via the nm yield function , which considers the full complexity of particle transport in the geomagnetosphere and in the earth atmosphere and the detector response i.e. registration efficiency and effective area itself .",
    "the analysis of a gles using nm data consists of several consecutive steps : computation of asymptotic viewing cones and rigidity cut - offs of the nms by modelling of particle propagation in a model magnetosphere ; assumption of an initial guess of the inverse problem ; application of an optimization procedure ( inverse method ) for derivation of the primary seps energy spectrum , anisotropy axis direction , pitch angle distribution .",
    "the detailed description of the method is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the method is similar to that used by @xcite .",
    "the relative count rate increase of a given nm is expressed as :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the rigidity spectrum of the primary solar particles in the direction of the maximal flux , @xmath4 is the rigidity spectrum of gcr at given time @xmath5 with the corresponding modulation , y(p ) is the nm yield function , @xmath6 is the pitch angle distribution of seps ( the pitch angle @xmath7 is defined as the angle between the asymptotic direction @xmath8 and the axis of anisotropy @xmath9 i.e. @xmath10=@xmath8.@xmath9 , @xmath11 is the count rate due to gcr , @xmath12 is the count rate increase due to solar particles , @xmath13 is the minimum rigidity cut - off of the station , accordingly @xmath14 is the maximum rigidity of seps considered in the model , assumed to be 20 gv , which is sufficiently high for seps .",
    "the fractional increase of the count rate of a nm station represents the ratio between the nm count rates due to seps and gcr averaged over 2 hours before the event s onset . here",
    "we use a newly computed nm yield function , which considers the finite lateral extend of cosmic ray induced atmospheric cascade and provides good agreement with experimental latitude surveys as well as other measurements @xcite .",
    "in addition in order to reduce and eliminate uncertainties as the application of two attenuation lengths method i.e. normalization of high altitude nm count rates to the sea level during gle analysis , which includes additional uncertainty , we use nm yield functions computed at various altitudes .",
    "this allows one to model the majority of nms in the network realistically , i.e. the response of each nm is modelled with his own yield function corresponding to the altitude above the sea level .    here",
    ", the computation of nm rigidity cut - off and asymptotic directions is performed with the magnetocosmics code @xcite using the combination of igrf geomagnetic model ( epoch 2010 ) as the internal field model and the tsyganenko 89 model as external field @xcite .",
    "this combination provide perfect balance between simplicity and realism @xcite .",
    "for the galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) spectrum we apply a parametrisation based on the force - field model @xcite with a solar modulation parameter according to @xcite .",
    "the solution of the inverse problem is performed using the levenberg - marquardt method @xcite , where the optimization is performed by minimization of the difference between the modelled nm responses and the measured nm responses i.e.optimization of the functional @xmath15 over the vector of unknowns and @xmath16 nm stations :    @xmath17^{2 } \\label{simp_eqn2}\\ ] ]      it is known that the effective dose , usually used for radiation protection purposes is not a measurable , therefore , the international commission of radiation protection icrp suggest the ambient dose equivalent denoted as @xmath18 , which is the dose equivalent that would be produced by the corresponding expanded and aligned field at a depth @xmath19 in a international commission on radiation units and measurements ( icru ) sphere ( a sphere with diameter of 30 cm made of tissue equivalent material with a density of 1 @xmath20 and a mass composition of 76.2 @xmath1 oxygen , 11.1 @xmath1 carbon , 10.1 @xmath1 hydrogen and 2.6 @xmath1 nitrogen ) on the radius vector opposing the direction of the aligned field .",
    "the unit for both effective dose and ambient dose equivalent is sv .",
    "the ambient dose equivalent at a depth of d=10 mm @xmath21 is recommended as a reasonable proxy for the effective dose @xcite .",
    "the effective dose rate at a given atmospheric depth @xmath22 induced by a primary cr particle is given by :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the energy of the primary cr particle arriving from zenith angle @xmath25 and azimuth angle @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the differential energy spectrum of the primary cr at the top of the atmosphere for @xmath28 component ( proton and/or @xmath0particle ) , @xmath29 is the geomagnetic latitude , @xmath30 is a solid angle and @xmath31 is the effective dose yield function .",
    "the corresponding effective dose yield function @xmath31 is defined as    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the fluence to effective dose conversion coefficient for a secondary particle of type @xmath34 ( neutron , proton , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) with energy @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the fluence of secondary particle of type @xmath34 , produced by a primary particle of type @xmath28 ( proton and/or @xmath0particle ) with a given primary energy @xmath24 .",
    "the conversion coefficients @xmath33 for a particle of type @xmath34 are obtained using monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "accordingly the secondary particle flux produced by primary protons and @xmath0particles in a wide energy range is obtained on the basis of extensive high statistics atmospheric cascade simulations using planetocosmics code @xcite assuming a realistic atmospheric model nrlmsise00 @xcite .",
    "the yield function considers the complexity of the atmospheric cascade development , since it brings information of particle fluence and spectrum at a given altitude in the atmosphere , considering the secondary particle attenuation .",
    "the newly computed effective dose yield function for 35 kft ( typical commercial flight altitude @xmath44 10.5 km ) is shown in fig.2 , within the separate contribution of protons and @xmath0particles .",

    "we adopt the data sets for an isotropic particle fluence from appendix 2 of @xcite i.e. the fluence to ambient dose equivalent conversion coefficients for the described above secondaries .    [ !",
    "ht ]    [ !",
    "ht ]    according to our computation the largest contribution to effective , accordingly ambient dose equivalent at near ground and ground altitudes is due to secondary muons and neutrons , while at aviation altitudes of about 10 km a.s.l . and at low cut - off rigidity , neutrons and protons together account for about 80@xmath1 of the exposure .",
    "however , at high rigidity cut - off regions of about @xmath47 = 15 gv , the contribution of protons is smaller and the components of electromagnetic cascade take over .",
    "the model is applied for computation of ambient dose equivalent @xmath21 at altitude of 35 kft a.s.l .",
    "it is compared with reference data , shown in ( fig.3 ) , which span periods corresponding to different solar activity , namely from solar minimum to solar maximum @xcite .",
    "a good agreement is achieved , specifically in mid and high rigidity cut - off regions .",
    "the observed marginal difference for the period 1998 and 2000 in the region of low rigidity cut - off is due to modulation effects .",
    "in addition , a comparison with recent measurements ( flight campaigns over germany and norway ) as well as with pandoca model is performed and good agreement is achieved details given in fig.4 @xcite .",

    "according to the presented in fig.5 results the ambient dose equivalent @xmath21 is a conservative approach for the exposure in low rigidity cut - off regions , while the effective dose is a conservative approach above some 5 gv . even the ambient dose equivalent @xmath21 is not a conservative estimate for cosmic radiation exposure at aviation altitudes , specifically in high rigidity regions , it is regarded as an acceptable approximation for effective dose .",

    "during major gles , the dose rate is a superposition of the contribution of gcrs and seps , the latter possessing an essential anisotropic part , specifically during the event onset . as the first step we derive the sep spectra and anisotropy outside the magnetosphere using data from the global nm network ( fig.1 ) and the method described in subsection ii.a . in order to consider explicitly the anisotropy we compute the asymptotic cones in the region of interest in a grid of 5@xmath53 @xmath54 5@xmath53 .",
