    "hadron colliders are a rich source for the production of new resonances with strong coupling due to colored particles in the initial state .",
    "a particularly simple and powerful probe of new colored resonances is the di - jet channel where the resonance decays to two partons .",
    "each successive hadron collider with an increase in center of mass energy and integrated luminosity has been able to probe di - jet resonances with higher masses .",
    "many well motivated theories of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) predict new particles that give rise to signatures in the di - jet channel .",
    "these new particles can have different spin and color structure and a sample of such possibilities is listed below .",
    "the color - octet vector boson arises as a result of extending the gauge group of the strong sector .",
    "the chiral structure of the couplings between quarks and the color - octet varies and the couplings can either be flavor universal or flavor non - universal .",
    "examples of flavor universal scenarios are the axigluon @xcite and coloron @xcite where all quarks are charged under the same @xmath3 group .",
    "flavor non - universal scenarios appear in the case of the topgluon where the third generation quarks are assigned to one @xmath3 group and the light quarks to the other @xcite and the axigluon where different chiralities of the same quark can be charged under different groups @xcite .",
    "other examples include kaluza - klein ( kk ) gluons which are excited gluons in extra - dimensional models @xcite , technirhos which are composite colored vector mesons found in technicolor  @xcite , models that include colored technifermions and low - scale string resonances  @xcite .",
    "the electrically neutral color - singlet vector boson , collectively called a @xmath4 , also appears in many beyond sm physics scenarios and can originiate from extending the electroweak @xmath5 or @xmath6 gauge group .",

    "searches for new resonances in the di - jet channel have been performed at the cern @xmath8  @xcite , tevatron  @xcite and the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite . once a resonance has been discovered the next step is to measure the properties of the resonance .",
    "the di - jet invariant mass @xmath9 and the angular distributions of energetic jets relative to the beam axis are sensitive observables to determine the mass and spin of the resonance .",
    "the coupling strength of the resonance to sm quarks can be constrained using the cross section of the di - jet channel and the chiral structure can be determined by combining the di - jet channel with the channel where the resonance is produced in association with a sm electroweak gauge boson  @xcite . as a next step ,",
    "we explore the question of determining the color structure of the resonance produced in the di - jet channel ; in particular we explore whether the resonance is a color - octet or a color - singlet state .    to distinguish a color - octet and a color - singlet resonance produced in the di - jet channel we introduce a new variable called the color discriminant variable .",
    "assuming that the new resonance decays only to quarks , this variable reflects the color structure of the resonance and is constructed from measurements which can be made in the di - jet discovery channel , namely the di - jet cross section , mass and width of the resonance .",
    "we demonstrate the utility of this variable in distinguishing color - octet and color - singlet resonances using the simple flavor universal example of a coloron and a leptophobic @xmath10 .",

    "the color discriminant variable can be used to distinguish colorons and leptophobic @xmath10s in the intermediate region where both resonances are allowed , discoverable at the lhc , and have widths in the appropriate range ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "note that this overlap region expands with increasing luminosity .",
    "our analysis is not useful in the low mass region because a coloron there is either already excluded by lhc searches or is too narrow .",

    "if a resonance is discovered in the di - jet channel with a mass of @xmath105 with @xmath101 integrated luminosity , then we would have confidence that it is a coloron and not a leptophobic @xmath10 .",

    "however the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensuniv ] show a clear dependence of @xmath60 on the mass of the resonance ( @xmath56 ) .",

    "several scenarios may be allowed for a given measured value of mass and @xmath60 .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : xilog](a ) , for @xmath123 a few of the allowed possibilities include a leptophobic @xmath10 with @xmath124 and a coloron with @xmath125 and are marked by the points labeled @xmath126 respectively .",

    "additional information is required , for instance , by measuring @xmath49 from the ratio of the cross sections when the resonance decays to top pairs vs jets as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) . with these two measurements , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath60 and @xmath49 , one can distinguish between color - octet and color - singlet resonances and their flavor structure .",
    "finally , we note that distinguishing between color - octet and color - singlet resonances of various flavor structures depends on the reach of @xmath49 as well as the precision with which @xmath49 can be measured at the lhc .",
    "this in turn depends on the measurements of the cross section in the di - jet channel and the top pair channel and the associated uncertainties .",
    "for example , a resonance may be discovered at a given mass in the di - jet channel and a measurement of @xmath60 may be made .",
    "however a measurement of the cross section in the top pair channel may not be possible or may have large uncertainties due to limited statistics ( because of small branching to top pairs ) .",
    "in such a case a measurement of @xmath49 is not possible or has very large errors and the ability to distinguish various flavor scenarios is reduced .",
    "a detailed exploration of the reach and precision with which @xmath49 can be measured is beyond the scope and focus of this article .",
    "instead we refer the interested reader to experimental studies of resonance searches in the top pair @xcite and di - jet channels @xcite and the results of such studies can provide an estimate of @xmath49 and the uncertainties in measuring @xmath49 .",
    "di - jet resonance searches are simple but powerful model - independent probes for discovering new particles motivated in many new physics scenarios .",
    "once a resonance has been discovered in the di - jet channel it will be very important to measure its properties .",
    "the di - jet ( discovery ) channel can provide information about the mass and spin of the resonance as well as constrain the coupling strength .",
    "it does not provide information about the chiral structure ; that can be obtained by including information from the channel where the resonance is produced in association with a sm electroweak gauge boson .",
    "the next question that remains to be resolved is the color structure of the new resonance ; in particular , whether it is a color - octet or color - singlet resonance .    in this article we proposed a new variable called the color discriminant variable ( @xmath60 ) to distinguish color - octet from color - singlet resonances .",
    "this variable is relatively model - independent and is sensitive to the color and flavor structure . in order to make our study as widely applicable as possible , we studied phenomenological models of color - octet and color - singlet resonances without being tied down to a specific theory .",
    "as illustrative examples we studied colorons and leptophobic @xmath10s in the flavor universal case as well as an illustrative flavor non - universal scenario .",
    "we analyzed the current constraints on the parameter space and the discovery potential of coloron and leptophobic @xmath10 models at the future lhc .",
    "we sampled a wide range of masses , couplings and values of @xmath49 , which parameterizes the relative coupling strength of the third generation and first generation sm quarks to the new resonance .",

    "energy of @xmath1 for varying luminosities , @xmath127 , after including all uncertainties .",
    "we found that our method has a wide reach in mass and couplings as well as @xmath49 .",
    "a measurement of @xmath60 alone can distinguish between color - octet and color - singlet states for a given flavor scenario .",
    "however to distinguish between different flavor scenarios we will need additional information which comes from a measurement of @xmath49 .",
    "together , @xmath60 and @xmath49 can help distinguish a color - octet from a color - singlet state as well as establish the nature of the couplings in the flavor sector .",
    "we find that the lhc will be able to provide information about the color and flavor structure of a new di - jet resonance for a wide range of couplings and masses and hence point us in the direction of the underlying theoretical structure .",

    "we extract the uncertainty of the intrinsic width from a measurement of the total width and a knowledge of the systematic uncertainties in measuring that width .",
    "the systematic uncertainties relevant to width measurement are the di - jet mass resolution and the uncertainty in the di - jet mass resolution ; we model them to have a gaussian distribution and ignore correlations between them .",
    "the standard deviation of the observed invariant mass distribution ( @xmath128 ) is related to the standard deviation of the intrinsic width ( @xmath129 assuming a gaussian distribution ) and that of the detector mass resolution ( @xmath72 ) by _ = .",
