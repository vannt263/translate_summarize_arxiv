    "the search for the dark matter plays a central role in modern astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "a key factor in constraining the cosmic abundance of dark matter is to measure rotation curves or velocity dispersions of galaxies . because spiral galaxy rotation curves provide sensitive constraints on dark matter",
    ", it is common to measure velocity dispersions in these systems .",
    "however , there are fewer available data sets of velocity dispersions for elliptical galaxies .    at the same time",
    ", the characteristic velocity dispersion of elliptical galaxies is a very important parameter in the statistical study of strong gravitational lensing , because the optical depth for lensing by galaxies is proportional to the fourth power of the velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the value of the normalized dark matter velocity dispersion for luminous elliptical galaxies that should be used in the strong gravitational lensing analysis is still under some debate .",
    "for example , in 1984 turner et al . suggested that one should use directly observed velocity dispersions , and multiply them by @xmath16 to determine dark matter velocity dispersions , as suggested by the virial theorem .",
    "however , kochanek has argued using dynamical models that one should simply use the measured velocity dispersions as the dark matter velocity dispersions for the lensing calculation , without any @xmath16 correction .",
    "however , even in this case , one must still estimate the characteristic dark matter velocity dispersion for ellipticals , and this depends on one s assumptions about the elliptical galaxy luminosity function @xcite .",
    "moreover , both kochanek and turner et al . focussed on the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model in their gravitational lensing analysis .",
    "this model is clearly a very rough approximation to actual galaxies .    in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to re - examine both the appropriate luminosity function and velocity dispersions for use in lensing statistics analyses . in our analysis",
    "we consider a finite core model , and consider the self - consistent determination of the velocity dispersion and luminosity function for ellipticals .",
    "this analysis is relevant even if the core radius is quite small , or zero . to be consistent",
    "we calculate the luminosity function in the same band in which we estimate velocity dispersions .",
    "we choose the hubble constant @xmath13 = 100 @xmath14 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 throughout .",
    "we investigate the luminosity function in section  [ sec : lf ] . in section 3",
    "we review our investigation of the theoretical determination of the dark matter velocity dispersion in galaxies with core radii using dynamical models with luminosity profiles discussed by jaffe and hernquist . in sections  [ sec : re ] and  [ sec : test ] , we will describe our main results appropriate for use in lensing studies , including normalized velocity dispersions and their power law relations with the luminosity .",
    "the appropriate value of @xmath17 in a schechter formulation of the luminosity function will depend on which magnitude system one is measuring , so that there is no unique value of @xmath17 . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the shape of the schechter luminosity function for a sample of elliptical galaxies in the @xmath8 band , as defined in de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( hereafter rc3 ) .",
    "in order to calculate the luminosity of each galaxy in the @xmath8 band , we choose the distance of each galaxy from faber et al .",
    "( hereafter 7s ) , and the apparent magnitude @xmath8 of each galaxy from rc3 .",
    "we find 415 galaxies in this set .",
    "however , we need to obtain a complete magnitude limited sample set to calculate the luminosity function @xcite . based on the discussion in 7s ,",
    "the elliptical galaxies in 7s are complete to apparent magnitude 11.89 .",
    "however , the rc3 catalogue was published after the appearance of 7s .",
    "therefore , we consider galaxies with the apparent magnitudes given in 7s less than or equal to 11.89 , and then check out their corresponding apparent magnitudes in rc3 .",
    "we find the dimmest ( or the largest number ) apparent magnitude among these galaxies is 12.19 .",
    "thus , we use 12.19 as the cutoff apparent magnitude in rc3 , and select those galaxies in 7s whose corresponding apparent magnitudes in rc3 are less than 12.19 .",
    "there are 131 galaxies in the final sample set .",
    "we then determined the luminosity function of this sample as described below .",
    "we use here sty maximum likelihood method @xcite .",
    "there are some advantages to use this method , as discussed in efstathiou , ellis & peterson ( hereafter eep ) .",
    "consider the following probability p_i [ eq : prob ] with schechter function ( l_i ) = ^ * ( ) ^ ( - ) [ eq : sche ] this is the probability to find a galaxy at distance @xmath18 with luminosity @xmath19 in the magnitude - limited sample set . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are calculated by using the distance @xmath18 ( in unit of @xmath22 mpc ) and the brightest and the dimmest apparent magnitudes among the whole magnitude - limited sample set .",
    "for example , the brightest apparent magnitude in our sample set is 9.26 , so @xmath23 will be equal to @xmath24 , with @xmath25 = 9.26 .",
    "the likelihood function is @xmath26@xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the total number of galaxies in the sample set .",
    "we maximize the likelihood function @xmath29 with two parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( or @xmath17 ) .",
    "we do not additionally correct for a malmquist bias because the average dispersion between different @xmath32 magnitudes in rc3 is small , and also because faber et al .",
    "already corrected for the malmquist bias when they estimated the final distances of the galaxies in 7s . from the maximum likelihood analysis , we get the parameters @xmath7 = -19.66 + 5@xmath33 and @xmath30 = 0.15",
    "@xmath34 ( 1 @xmath35 error ) ( figure  [ fig : sty ] ) .",
    "-41 mm @xmath30    because of the use of two different samples to attempt to obtain a complete magnitude limited survey , one might be concerned that different choices of magnitude cutoff would produce different maximum likelihood estimates for the luminosity function parameters .",
    "we explored a variety of combinations in this regard , and found consistent results within the uncertainties quoted above .",
    "for example , if we consider galaxies whose apparent magnitudes are below the apparent magnitude threshold in 7s , then find the corresponding apparent magnitudes in rc3 , and neglect one apparently anomalous faint galaxy in 7s with apparent magnitude 11.00 in rc3 , then the next galaxy which is below the threshold in 7s has apparent magnitude 11.83 in rc3 .",
    "if we use 11.82 as the cutoff apparent magnitude , then we will have 82 galaxies in the sample set , and then we get @xmath7 = -19.78 and @xmath30 = 0.22 . choosing a fainter cutoff , 11.98 ,",
    "we find @xmath7 = -19.74 and @xmath30 = 0.00 with 107 galaxies in the sample set .",
    "as claimed , these are within the uncertainties in our quoted value above .      in order to examine the goodness of fit of the schechter function to the data we utilize a step - wise maximum likelihood method to fit the data ( eep ) .",

    "we have already mentioned the importance of using a self - consistent analysis of dark matter velocity dispersions when attempting to model galaxies as lenses @xcite . here",
    "we describe such an analysis for various galaxy models .",
    "the key point is that the determination of @xmath2 is a sensitive function of the galaxy anisotropy parameters and core radius , and one must consider this sensitivity when determining @xmath2 on the basis of various observations .",
    "a theoretical dynamical analysis suggests that measuring line of sight velocity dispersions at the de vaucouleurs effective radius @xmath61 , can provide a relatively robust estimate of the underlying @xmath2 , and also allow one to extract out contributions due to central mass concentrations in the galaxy .",

    "when @xmath68 is zero , this model reverts to a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model .",
    "we should bear in mind that the velocity dispersion in this equation , which is assumed to be independent of radius , can not be measured directly .",
    "what we can measure is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath69 , with the projected distance @xmath70 measured from the center of the observed galaxy ( i.e. , @xmath70 is perpendicular to the line - of - sight to us ) .",

    "@xmath2 is not a function of @xmath70 , but @xmath69 is , and this relationship is different when a galaxy has a finite core ( although this is a secondary issue ) .",
    "thus , one has to be careful how to use the measured velocity dispersion to derive the relevant quantity to utilize for lensing , namely whether it well approximates @xmath2 . to find the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath69 , we start from jeans equations as follows @xcite : ( ) + 2 = - [ eq : jean ] where = _ 0^r dr^^2 ( r^ ) = 2_dm^2[eq : poten ] by using equation  ( [ eq : dens ] ) .    in equation",

    "we have considered two different but similar luminosity profiles @xmath71 .",
    "we adopt @xmath81 , with @xmath82 , from jaffe , and @xmath83 , with @xmath84 , from hernquist .",
    "we performed our numerical calculations by adjusting @xmath79 = 0.4 , 0.2 , 0 , -0.2 , -0.4 and @xmath68 = 0 , @xmath85 for both jaffe and hernquist luminosity profiles ( figure  [ fig : jaffe ] and figure  [ fig : hernquist ] ) . the ratio of the core radius to the effective radius may be estimated from lauer , and we find that this ratio is between 1/20 and 1/60 for class i galaxies in lauer . from figure",
    "[ fig : jaffe ] and figure  [ fig : hernquist ] , we clearly see that @xmath80 is strongly sensitive to the anisotropy when the projected radius is less than 0.1@xmath61 ( whether or not the core radius is non - zero , a factor to which the result is also sensitive ) .",
    "this is consistent with observational data @xcite .",
    "it can thus be dangerous to simply consider the line - of - sight velocity dispersion within 0.1@xmath61 as @xmath2 .",
    "even if the core radius is effectively very small , as numerous observations of ellipticals suggest , the sensitivity to the anisotropy parameter implies one should be careful when interpreting meassured values of the velocity dispersion .",
    "however , if we are careful to look at all the 40 curves in figure  [ fig : jaffe ] and figure  [ fig : hernquist ] , we can find the following inequalities :    @xmath86 + these indicate that the intrinsic scatter of @xmath2 will be less than 10 per cent if we can measure the line - of - sight velocity dispersion at @xmath61 or half @xmath61 .",
    "then , we can multiply this velocity dispersion by the average value ( e.g. , 1.31 for @xmath70 = @xmath61 , or 1.25 for @xmath70 = @xmath87 ) , in order to get @xmath2 .",
    "we can see that this argument is almost independent of the core radius of each galaxy and the anisotropy parameter @xmath79 .",
    "we consider below the velocity dispersions at two different @xmath70 values as a consistency check of our analysis .",
    "first however , we comment on another important feature of these figures which is relevant to a determination of galaxy parameters for lensing purposes .",
    "kochanek has pointed out that the inclusion of a core radius will in general require , for self - consistency , a larger value of @xmath2 to be used in models , and has argued that this will cancel out the effect that non - zero core radii can have on suppressing lensing optical depths if the value of @xmath2 were instead kept fixed .",
    "examining figures  [ fig : jaffe ] and  [ fig : hernquist ] at approximately 0.5 @xmath61 , where the different curves intersect , indeed illustrates the effect described by kochanek .",
    "as the core radius is increased @xmath2 increases .",
    "however the key point is that the change in @xmath2 is small compared to the huge variances in @xmath2 one sees in models with different values of @xmath79 , and also is small compared to the possibility of overestimating @xmath2 if central line - of - sight velocity dispersions are used .",
    "note that in this section we chose 42 galaxies from 12 different data sets to be our galaxy sample , because for these we could find or estimate the velocity dispersions at both @xmath61 and @xmath87 . among those 12 sets of observations , most use a slit size from one to three arcseconds .",
    "this should therefore not be significant when @xmath61 is on the order of ten arcseconds , as it is in this paper ( see table  [ table : re ] ) . furthermore , from figures  [ fig : jaffe ] and  [ fig : hernquist ] , one can see that the velocity curves are relatively smooth between @xmath61 and @xmath87 ( i.e. , theoretically , @xmath88 ) .",
    "this indicates that even if the slit size were up to half @xmath61 , this effect might still not strongly bias the results .",
    "based on values of @xmath61 from rc3 , we can estimate velocity dispersions @xmath2 of these 42 galaxies .",
    "we also consider @xmath61 from various different papers and translate the different values of velocity dispersions into the uncertainty of the velocity dispersion measured at @xmath61 , as given by rc3 . we would quote either this uncertainty or the uncertainty from the observations , whichever is larger .",
    "the other problem is that different observers might use different methods to measure velocity dispersions .",
    "we calculate the weighted mean of all these velocity dispersions for one galaxy as our final line - of - sight velocity dispersion of that galaxy @xcite .",
    "we list the information of @xmath90 , distances and velocity dispersions of all 42 galaxies in table  [ table : re ] .",
    "using table  [ table : re ] and a suitable value for @xmath7 = -19.66 + 5@xmath91 as discussed in section  [ sec : lf ] , we can calculate the least - square - fit of the relation between @xmath92 and @xmath93/km s@xmath94 ( figure  [ fig : re ] ) .",
    "we exclude galaxies , , , and , because the former two galaxies do not have available distances from 7s , and the latter two galaxies are extreme outlyers ( one galaxy is the farthest right one and the other galaxy is the lowest one in figure  [ fig : re ] . ) , and there is no available observational value of @xmath61 of in rc3 .",
    "we obtain _ 10 ( l / l^*)= ( -4.04 0.49 ) + ( 1.89 0.22)_10(_r_e / km  s^-1 ) [ eq : vre ] with @xmath95 = 48 for 38 galaxies in figure  [ fig : re ] .",
    "we use both uncertainties of luminosities and velocity dispersions to work out uncertainties in equation  ( [ eq : vre ] ) and its @xmath95 .",
    "if we set @xmath96 in equation  ( [ eq : vre ] ) , then we find the velocity dispersion of luminous elliptical galaxies at the effective radius , @xmath97 km s@xmath4 . from the discussion in section  [ sec : vd ] , we then multiply this number by 1.31 , to get @xmath98 178 km s@xmath4 .",

    "the final 95 per cent confidence level is then determined to be @xmath104 km s@xmath4 .",
    "several issues are relevant to this result . in the first place , note that the @xmath105 vs @xmath35 relation in the above equation differs from the standard faber - jackson relation @xcite .",
    "note however that this fj relation is appropriate for central velocity dispersions .",
    "in addition , it may be there case that the elliptical galaxies do not form a uniform population , but rather that bright galaxies and faint galaxies follow separate faber - jackson curves ( this point was raised to us by j. peebles , who has been investigating this issue @xcite ) .",
    "nakamura and suto have also pointed out how the value of the power law relation can differ from 4 .",
    "it thus may not be appropriate to enforce this relation on the bulk sample . to explore this latter possibility , and because it is galaxies with the largest velocity dispersions which will dominate in the analysis of lensing statistics , we considered a subset of our galaxy sample with @xmath93/km s@xmath106 ( i.e. , 23 galaxies ) and rederived the @xmath105-@xmath35 relation . in this case , we find :    _ 10 ( l / l^*)= ( -6.20 1.82 ) + ( 2.83 0.79)_10(_r_e / km  s^-1 ) [ eq : vre2.2 ] with @xmath107 and @xmath108 km s@xmath4 . in this case",

    "it is important to recognize that the central mass contribution can affect the velocity dispersion more significantly than it affects the optical depth for lensing , so that incorporating this contribution in an effective isothermal sphere velocity dispersion will lead to an overestimate of the optical depth .    as a quick demonstration ,",
    "let us see how we can extract out the central mass contribution .",
    "if we simply assume @xmath124 due to a point mass at the center of galaxy , from equations  ( [ eq : brit ] ) and  ( [ eq : model ] ) , we can obtain _ los^2 ( r ) = where @xmath125 is the mass of that point mass .",

    "it is interesting to note that when values close to these are utilized in an analysis of lensing statistics @xcite one obtains mean angular splittings that are comparable to the observed splittings .",
    "first note that both @xmath7 and @xmath30 , fitted to the schechter function are close to the results in loveday et al .  .",
    "this is expected , because the @xmath32 and @xmath130 bands are close .",
    "in fact , we would expect our @xmath7 to be slightly fainter than @xmath131 (= -19.71 + 5@xmath132 ) , because the @xmath130 band is measured at a longer wavelength and most galaxy luminosities are peaker toward the redder end of the spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "our @xmath7 is brighter than @xmath133 (= -19.37 + 5@xmath132 ) given in eep . given the galactic extinction correction ,",
    "this is also what we would expect .",
    "we have also shown that the schechter @xmath30 of elliptical galaxies is shallower than that for total galaxies , which is consistent with eep and loveday et al .  .",
    "the ratio of our @xmath44 to the one in loveday et al .",
    "is about 9.6 per cent . in comparison with the @xmath44 in mobasher , sharples & ellis  ,",
    "the ratio is about 12 per cent .",
    "these two numbers indicate the fraction of elliptical galaxies out of total galaxies , and they are consistent with the conclusion of postman & geller  , of 12 @xmath15 2 per cent for this ratio .",
    "our results here suggest that the population of elliptical galaxies is ( 10.8 @xmath15 1.2 ) per cent of all galaxies .    regarding our luminosity function determination , it is of course still possible that the galaxies in our sample set do not form a complete sample set .",
    "currently , we calculate @xmath134 = 0.45  @xcite .",
    "if we had an incomplete elliptical galaxy sample set , and if we would believe those ` missing ' e galaxies are near apparent magnitude 12.19 , then we would expect @xmath134 larger than 0.45 . also , according to the theoretical prediction in zucca , pozzetti & zamorani  , we would then have an even a dimmer @xmath135 and a steeper @xmath30 .",
    "a fainter @xmath135 would result an even smaller @xmath121 than the value calculated in section  [ sec : re ] and section  [ sec : test ] .",
    "the analysis in section  [ sec : re ] , suggests @xmath136 15 km s@xmath4 .",
    "it implies that @xmath137 29 km s@xmath4 .",
    "this uncertainty is large , because the uncertainties from distances of galaxies in the sample set and from @xmath7 are large .",
    "( also note that the best fit value if we account for possible central mass concentrations is @xmath138 km s@xmath4 , which falls within the range included above . )",
    "we also notice that @xmath7 is a sensitively coupled to @xmath3 .",
    "for example , if we use @xmath7 = -19.9 + 5@xmath132  @xcite , then we will increase @xmath3 by 8%-12% . on the other hand , if we use @xmath7 = -19.5 + @xmath139 , then we will decrease @xmath3 by 5%-8% .",
    "one should be careful about this issue in any strong gravitational lensing analysis .",
    "the completeness of our galaxy sample discussed in section  [ sec : sty ] does not seem to lead to a significant uncertainty by comparison .",
    "for example , different numbers of galaxies included in our sample produce a variation of 4%-6% in @xmath2 , which is within the values estimated from the uncertainty of @xmath140 itself",
    ". it might be interesting to consider the relation between @xmath92 and @xmath141/km s@xmath94 in other bands ( e.g. v or r band , if the observation is possible ; or a radio survey ) , to see whether including more elliptical galaxies would reduce the intrinsic scatter of this power law relation .",
    "if so , then the improved value of @xmath3 and the power law from that survey would be a great help in the study of gravitational lensing statistics .",
    "based on our present result , the optical depth of gravitational lenses would be expected to be reduced by 43 per cent compared to the one in kochanek  , if all other parameters are unchanged .    in this paper",
    ", we treat the anisotropy parameter @xmath79 as a constant .",
    "we expect that our conclusion will not change too much even if @xmath79 is a function of radial distance @xmath67 , as long as @xmath142 0.4 @xcite ( figure  [ fig : jaffe ] and figure  [ fig : hernquist ] ) .",
    "finally , the theoretical modelling in section  [ sec : vd ] , suggests that @xmath80 is strongly dependent on models and parameters within 0.1@xmath61 ( figure  [ fig : jaffe ] and figure  [ fig : hernquist ] ) .",
    "we also observe that the ratio @xmath80 converges at about 0.5@xmath61 for all different parameters .",
    "this suggests that we should use observational values of @xmath80 between 0.4@xmath61 and @xmath61 , if we want to reduce the intrinsic scatter from theoretical modelling .",
    "we hope observers will consistently measure velocity dispersions of elliptical galaxies at both @xmath61 and @xmath143 in order to refine our results .",
    "as we have discussed in section  [ sec : test ] , one can extract extra velocity dispersions at @xmath61 ( and @xmath143 ) , and get an effective value of @xmath2 for each galaxy .",
    "as data improves , we expect that the techniques described here will be useful in further constraining input parameters in strong gravitational lensing analysis .",
    "we would like to thank harold corwin , deepak jain , peter kernan , jon loveday , paul mason , heather morrison , jim peebles , keith robinson , paul schechter and the anonymous referee for very helpful input .",
