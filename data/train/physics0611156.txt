    "thallium activated sodium iodide ( nai(tl ) ) crystals are a popular choice as a target material for dark matter experiments .",
    "this is because of their relatively high light yield and pulse shape differences between nuclear and electron recoils .",
    "currently three experiments utilise these crystals : anais  @xcite ; dama / nai  @xcite ; and elegant - v  @xcite .",
    "although better discrimination can be reached with other target media , nai(tl ) crystal - based detectors remain one of the best at determining spin - dependent wimp - nucleon limits .",
    "for instance , for direct detection techniques , the naiad experiment  @xcite still holds the best spin - dependent limit on wimp - proton interactions  @xcite .",
    "hence , nai(tl ) remains an important detector material in non - baryonic dark matter searches .",
    "an important measurement to determine a scintillating target s sensitivity to dark matter particles is the ratio of light induced by a nuclear recoil ( produced by wimp / neutron collisions with nuclei ) to that by an electron recoil of the same energy .",
    "this is known as the quenching factor .",
    "the 2-inch diameter , encapsulated , nai(tl ) crystal is placed in the path of a 2.45  mev mono - energetic deuterium - deuterium neutron beam as shown in figure  [ qf_setup ] . a 3-inch etl 9265 kb photomultiplier tube",
    "is optically coupled to the crystal .",
    "neutrons that interact with the target nuclei scatter off at an angle that is dependent on the deposited neutron energy :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the recoil energy , @xmath2 is the mass of the target nucleus , @xmath3 is the energy of the neutron beam , @xmath4 is the scattering angle and @xmath5 is the mass of the neutron .",
    "a bc501a liquid scintillator detector is placed at various angles around the target to detect scattered neutrons at nuclear recoil energies given by eq .",
    "( [ scatter_eq ] ) .",
    "pulses from the target and liquid scintillator that are coincident within a 100  ns time window are sent to a 2-channel , 8-bit , acqiris digitizer with a 500  mhz sampling rate , and written to disk .",
    "it is known that the response of nai(tl ) to gamma - rays is non - linear at low energies  @xcite .",
    "the crystal is exposed to gamma - rays from a variety of low energy sources , between 29  kev ( @xmath6 xe @xmath7 x - rays ) and 122  kev ( @xmath8 @xmath9-rays ) . a decrease in detector response",
    "is observed at the iodine k - shell absorption edge at 33.2  kev , consistent with other studies  @xcite .",
    "therefore , determination of the energy scale must be performed in an energy region where a linear response is observed .",
    "the crystal is calibrated with a @xmath8 source , as shown in figure  [ response](a ) .",
    "the iodine escape peak at 90  kev is also seen .",
    "a light yield of 5.5  photoelectrons / kev is found .",

    "the nuclear recoil energy spectrum measured at each scattering angle is converted to an electron equivalent energy scale ( kevee ) and compared to the expected nuclear recoil energy ( kevnr ) at that angle .",
    "the ratio between the measured nuclear recoil energy , and that calculated from eq .",
    "( [ scatter_eq ] ) , is the quenching factor .    in order to eliminate the background from gamma - ray interactions , nuclear recoils",
    "are discerned by discrimination of pulse shapes from the bc501a detector and time - of - flight measurements .",
    "events that arise from gamma - ray interactions in the bc501a detector have shorter decay times relative to those from neutron collisions .",
    "adequate discrimination between nuclear and electron recoils is achieved by integrating over the tail of the pulse .",
    "the ratio between this partial area and the total pulse area is then plotted as a function of the total area .",
    "an example is illustrated in figure  [ psd](a ) .",

    "neutron and gamma events are separated .",
    "better discrimination at energy scales relevant to dark matter searches has been demonstrated in nai(tl ) crystals using the mean time @xmath12",
    "@xcite rather than the traditional double charge method  @xcite .",
    "the mean time is defined as : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the amplitude of the digitized pulse at the time bin @xmath15 . after gamma events",
    "have been rejected by performing the cuts outlined above , mean time distributions for each nuclear recoil energy are investigated .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ psd](c ) .",
    "this is compared with the mean time of compton recoils induced by a @xmath16 source in figure  [ response](b ) . in agreement with previous work  @xcite , it is clear that this difference is less prominent at energies less than 10  kevee , limiting the discrimination power of nai(tl ) detectors .",
    "this cut serves to reduce the background from noise and gamma pulses , leading to a nuclear recoil peak as shown in figure  [ psd](d ) .",
    "the quenching factor varies between 19% to 26% in the range 10  kev to 100  kev nuclear recoil energy , which agrees with previous experimental results  @xcite , as shown in figure  [ qf_plot ] . from figure  [ psd](d )",
    ", a scintillation efficiency of @xmath17% has been determined for 10  kevnr na recoils .",
    "scintillation efficiency measurements have been performed for na recoils in a nai(tl ) crystal .",
    "the results show an average value of 22.1% at energies less than 50  kevnr , and are in agreement with other measurements .",
    "future plans include simulating nuclear recoils in nai(tl ) in an effort to decrease the errors in quenching factors .",
    "the authors would like to thank akira hitachi for valuable discussions of the results , and the provision of a preliminary theoretical estimation of the quenching factor .",
    "hc would also like to thank pparc for a phd studentship .",
