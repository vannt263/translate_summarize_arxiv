    "growing attention has recently been paid to the model buildings based on the scenario of extra dimensions compactified with tev scale  @xcite .",
    "along such a scenario the top quark condensate ( top - mode standard model : tmsm )  @xcite was reconsidered by several authors  @xcite in the versions with compactified extra dimensions , where the ad hoc four - fermion couplings in the original tmsm may be replaced by the strong attractive forces due to kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of the bulk standard model ( sm ) gauge bosons . in particular , arkani - hamed , cheng , dobrescu and hall ( acdh )  @xcite proposed a version of the tmsm where the third generation quarks / leptons as well as the sm gauge bosons are put in the bulk , while other generations in the brane . in a series of papers",
    "@xcite we investigated the full gauge dynamics ( _ without four - fermion interactions _ ) in the bulk , based on the ladder schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation .",
    "we further studied  @xcite phenomenological implications on the acdh scenario and found that @xmath6 ( four extra dimensions ) will be a viable case which predicts a correct top mass , @xmath7 gev , and a characteristic higgs mass , @xmath8 gev , from the requirement that only the top can condense ( `` topped mac '' or tmac requirement ) .    actually , the most prominent feature of the gauge theories with extra dimensions is that the theories become strongly coupled , with the coupling growing by the power running in the ultraviolet region beyond the compactification scale .",
    "let us take a class of @xmath2 gauge theories with massless @xmath3 flavors .",
    "it was pointed out  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the bulk gauge coupling of such gauge theories can have a ( nontrivial ) ultraviolet fixed point ( uvfp ) within the truncated kk effective theory  @xcite .",
    "although existence of such a uvfp is somewhat subtle in the lattice studies  @xcite and other nonperturbative approach  @xcite , unless it is an artifact of the truncated kk effective theory , it implies existence of a renormalizable interacting gauge theory even in dimensions higher than four .",
    "it is in sharp contrast to the conventional view ( based on the perturbation ) that higher dimensional gauge theories are nonrenormalizable and trivial .",
    "once we assume that such a nontrivial uvfp does exist beyond the truncated kk effective theory , the theory behaves near the uvfp as a _ walking gauge theory _  @xcite having a large anomalous dimension",
    "@xmath9  @xcite . in the four - dimensional case , as was pointed out by bardeen et al .",
    "@xcite , the four - fermion interaction becomes a marginal operator due to the large anomalous dimension , @xmath10 , of the walking gauge theory , and hence can be mixed with the gauge interaction .",
    "then _ the phase structure of the walking gauge theories should be analyzed in a larger parameter space including the four - fermion interactions as well as the gauge interactions_.    the gauged nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , a model of gauge theory plus four - fermion interaction , was first studied by bardeen , leung and love  @xcite within the ladder sd equation for the fixed gauge coupling in four dimensions .",
    "the critical line of the four - dimensional model for the fixed gauge coupling was discovered by kondo , mino and yamawaki  @xcite and independently by appelquist , soldate , takeuchi and wijewardhana  @xcite . since",
    "then the model has been offering many interesting applications for physics of dynamical symmetry breaking , such as the walking technicolor  @xcite , the strong etc technicolor  @xcite / topcolor - assisted technicolor  @xcite , and the tmsm  @xcite or topcolor  @xcite , etc .",
    "( see for reviews refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic dynamical feature of the four - dimensional gauged njl model is the large anomalous dimension  @xcite , @xmath11 , for the fixed ( walking ) gauge coupling , and the finiteness of all ( renormalized ) couplings at composite level as well as induced yukawa coupling of the fermion to the composite bosons in the continuum limit ( infinite cutoff limit ) .",
    "this implies the ( nonperturbative ) `` renormalizability '' or `` nontriviality '' of the model , as was pointed out in ref.@xcite for the ( `` moderately '' ) walking gauge coupling , with @xmath12  , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 measures the speed of running of the running gauge coupling  @xcite : @xmath16 is the normal running as in the qcd , while @xmath17 is the walking coupling and @xmath18 corresponds to the fixed ( `` standing '' limit of the walking ) gauge coupling .",

    "@xcite as well as for the moderately walking one in ref.@xcite . for the fixed gauge coupling ,",
    "such a phenomenon takes place along the whole critical line except for the pure njl point ( without gauge coupling and `` @xmath20 '' ) where the above couplings vanish logarithmically in the continuum limit and hence the theory becomes nonrenormalizable or trivial .",
    "inclusion of four - fermion interactions into the gauge theories has not been done so far in the context of the extra dimension scenario  .",
    "the analysis of the phase structure of the gauged njl model with extra dimensions for such walking gauge theories may be useful not only for the tmsm but for other strong coupling theories such as the bulk technicolor , various composite models , etc ..    in this paper we investigate phase structure of the gauged njl model in the @xmath0-dimensional bulk , based on the improved ladder sd equation for the bulk fermion propagator , assuming that the ( dimensionless ) bulk running gauge coupling is given by the truncated kk effective theory and hence almost fixed at the nontrivial uvfp in a wide energy range above the compactified energy scale .",
    "as far as the cutoff energy @xmath21 is large , the effect of the compactified scale is negligible and the sd equation is well approximated by that with the fixed coupling  @xcite .",
    "thus we take the gauge coupling be fixed at the value of uvfp for simplicity . here",
    "we should stress that our results in this paper crucially depend on the existence of such a uvfp .    by solving the sd equation",
    "we find the critical line in the two - dimensional parameter space ( @xmath22,@xmath23 ) of the coupling strength @xmath22 ( essentially the squared gauge coupling fixed at the uvfp value ) and the ( dimensionless ) four - fermion coupling @xmath23 : @xmath24 which exists only for @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the critical coupling strength of the pure gauge theory without four - fermion interaction  @xcite .",
    "the critical line separating the spontaneously broken phase ( with nonzero dynamical mass @xmath27 of the fermion ) and the unbroken one ( with zero dynamical mass ) resembles that in the four - dimensional gauged njl model with fixed gauge coupling  @xcite except for the prefactor @xmath28 instead of @xmath29 .",
    "note , however , that we actually consider in this paper a class of @xmath2 gauge theories ( with @xmath3 flavors ) which are asymptotically free having a trivial uvfp in four dimensions , @xmath30 , but do have the nontrivial one in higher dimensions , @xmath31 whose value is uniquely determined once the model parameters such as @xmath32 and @xmath3 are specified . each point on the above critical line thus corresponds to a single gauged njl model with a different gauge theory with different @xmath33 .",
    "we can not freely adjust its value .",
    "we further discuss the phase structure of the model , following the manner in the four - dimensional case  @xcite .",
    "we find that the decay constant @xmath34 of the composite nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson @xmath35 becomes finite in the continuum limit ( @xmath36 ) , if @xmath32 and @xmath3 are arranged so as to satisfy the condition @xmath37 where @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 we may call @xmath40 as a `` marginal triviality ( mt ) '' point , where the decay constant @xmath34 of the composite ng boson @xmath35 diverges logarithmically , @xmath41 , in the continuum limit @xmath36 and hence resembles the pure njl point ( zero gauge coupling ) in the four - dimensional case .",
    "then in the nontrivial window we find a surprising result that even in higher dimensions the four - fermion theory _ in the presence of gauge interactions _ becomes `` renormalizable '' and `` nontrivial '' in the sense that the induced ( renormalized ) yukawa coupling of the fermion to the ng boson and the ( renormalized ) couplings among @xmath35 and composite scalar @xmath42 all remain finite in the continuum limit ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this is analogous to the renormalizability and nontriviality of the four - dimensional case  @xcite except that the mt point in four - dimensional case corresponds to the pure njl point , @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "we demonstrate these facts by explicit computation of @xmath34 , the yukawa vertex @xmath45 , the scalar propagator @xmath46 , and the effective potential @xmath47 .    here",
    "we should emphasize one distinct feature of the inclusion of the four - fermion interaction into the gauge theory in the bulk with compactified extra dimensions : in the case of pure gauge theories ( without four - fermion interactions ) , the `` nontrivial '' theory defined at the critical point @xmath26 is only formal , since the gauge coupling @xmath22 at the uvfp is not a continuous parameter but a discrete one depending on @xmath32 and @xmath3 and hence can not be fine - tuned arbitrarily close to the critical value  @xcite .",
    "it means that even if we assume existence of the uvfp , _ the pure gauge theory in higher dimensions can only be renormalizable in a formal sense_. thus there is no finite theory for pure gauge theories .",
    "on the other hand , in the gauged njl model we do have a continuous parameter , the four - fermion coupling @xmath23 , and hence _ the nontrivial theory can be defined by fine - tuning @xmath23 arbitrarily close to the criticality of the four - fermion coupling _ at the critical line eq .",
    "( [ criticalline1 ] ) .",
    "note that for @xmath48 where no criticality of the four - fermion coupling exists , there is no finite theory even in the gauged njl model .    for the theories in the nontrivial window , @xmath49",
    ", we perform explicitly the renormalization of the effective potential in a way similar to the four - dimensional case given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the renormalized four - fermion coupling @xmath50 also has a uvfp @xmath51 .",
    "we then find that the theory has a large anomalous dimension at the uvfp @xmath52 : @xmath53 which takes the same form as that of the four - dimensional model  @xcite when @xmath54 in the prefactor is set to be @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 , the dynamical dimension of the four - fermion interaction , @xmath57 $ ] , reads @xmath58 for @xmath59 , and such an operator is a relevant operator similarly to the four - dimensional gauged njl model  @xcite .",
    "thus , as we were motivated by the four - dimensional case , we conclude that _ the phase structure of the gauge theory with extra dimensions which behaves as a walking theory should also be studied with inclusion of the four - fermion interaction_. as expected , in the renormalized effective potential there exist interactions of @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 ( nontriviality ) , which are _ conformal invariant_. the renormalizability / nontriviality implies a remarkable fact that the physics prediction is _ cutoff insensitive _ , notwithstanding the ultraviolet dominance of the dynamics of both the walking gauge and the four - fermion interactions strongly coupled in the ultraviolet region , which may be useful for model buildings .",
    "we further study rg flows of each theory in the nontrivial window governed by a uvfp @xmath63 corresponding to a set of @xmath64 ( each point lying on the critical line @xmath65 ) .",
    "then we find that our renormalization is consistently performed even off the uvfp .    for @xmath66 , on the other hand , we find that the gauged njl model becomes trivial and nonrenormalizable in spite of the fact that we can fine - tune the four - fermion coupling to make finite the dynamical mass of the fermion .",
    "the `` renormalized effective potential '' actually has no interaction terms of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this renormalization would lead to the `` anomalous dimension '' @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "however , our renormalization is incomplete for @xmath69 : there exists another marginal operator @xmath70 whose dynamical dimension is given by dim(@xmath71 ( marginal operator ! ) in our renormalization scheme .",
    "we further discuss in sec .",
    "[ summary ] the formal limit @xmath44 , in which @xmath72 and @xmath73 and hence the uvfp s for both regions of the nontrivial window @xmath74 and trivial region @xmath75 shrink to a single point of the pure njl point . nonetheless , the nontrivial window for @xmath4 coincides with the condition of the renormalizability / nontriviality of the four - dimensional gauged njl model with ( moderately ) walking gauge coupling characterized by @xmath12  @xcite , which is clearly distinguished from @xmath76 corresponding to the trivial region @xmath75 .",

    "<S> we assume that the bulk ( dimensionless ) running gauge coupling in the sd equation for the @xmath2 gauge theory with @xmath3 massless flavors is given by the truncated kaluza - klein effective theory and hence has a nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point ( uvfp ) , resulting in the walking coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we find the critical line in the parameter space of two couplings , the gauge coupling ( value fixed at the uvfp ) and the ( dimensionless ) four - fermion coupling , which is similar to that of the gauged njl model with fixed ( walking ) gauge coupling in four dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that _ in the presence of such walking gauge interactions _ the four - fermion interactions become `` nontrivial '' and `` renormalizable '' even in higher dimensions , similarly to the four - dimensional gauged njl model . </S>",
    "<S> such a renormalizability / nontriviality holds only in the restricted region of the critical line ( `` nontrivial window '' ) with the gauge coupling larger than a _ </S>",

    "<S> the renormalized effective potential yields a nontrivial interaction which is conformal invariant . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the nontrivial window implies `` cutoff insensitivity '' of the physics prediction in spite of the ultraviolet dominance of the dynamics . in the formal limit @xmath4 , the nontrivial window shrinks to the pure njl point but with a nontrivial condition which coincides with the known condition of the renormalizability / nontriviality of the four - dimensional gauged njl model , @xmath5 </S>"
