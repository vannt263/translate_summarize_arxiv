    "the _ solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation _ ( sumer ; wilhelm  _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) telescope and spectrometer has been taking ultraviolet spectra ( 50  nm to 161  nm ) from the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) since its launch in december 1995 .",
    "the complete dataset up to january 2013 has been reprocessed and is now available in fits format from the soho archive .",
    "the motivation and basic idea behind this communication is to describe aspects of the data acquisition that are relevant to the data quality and details of the various steps and procedures needed to arrive at level  1 ( l1 ) data .",
    "the data reduction steps used in the archive correspond to the best knowledge of today . even after so many years , the processing is still not perfect and at several stages compromises had to be taken , which may explain why this task was not completed earlier .",
    "sumer data has so far been accessible from archives that contain reformatted telemetry , _",
    "i.e. _ raw , level  0 ( lz ) data that is provided either in fits , fts , or idl restore format .",
    "various correction and calibration procedures have to be applied in order to minimize the known instrumental effects in lz data and to convert the incoming signal to physical quantities of the radiation .",
    "the basic knowledge acquired during ground testing and commissioning was continuously extended , confirmed , or improved over the years .",
    "this knowledge is documented in almost 1000 articles in refereed journals as indicated in figure  [ fig : publ ] .",
    "there are clear indications from the publication rate that also future work with sumer data can be expected .",
    "it is our motivation to make sure that the accumulated knowledge will not be forgotten , and at the same time provide ready - to - use spectra to the community for future work .",
    "details of the reduction procedures were made publicly available on the instrument web sites .",
    "the latest update was in 2008 .",
    "the procedures used to produce l1 data described here represent the present view of our instrument .",
    "a fair amount of this information is presented as a complete , overworked and self - standing document .",
    "we can not exclude deviations from the results of data processing that was completed in earlier times .",
    "the differences are to our knowledge small and will in all likelihood not affect the validity of previous analyses .",
    "therefore , this improved view of our instrument in no way compromises reduction work with previous versions , but does also not claim to be final .",
    "for this reason we have tried to make the description of each individual step as transparent as possible .",
    "this may help the user not to use the reduction as a black box , but to improve the results if future insights allow him to do so .",
    "the application of the various correction and calibration procedures has to reverse the order applied to the incoming signal by the various instrument subsystems .",
    "this applies in particular to stages of the signal processing in the detectors with specific shortcomings ( procedures 2 to 6 ) .",
    "therefore the sequence must be executed in the described order : 1 .",
    "decompression + 2 .",
    "deadtime correction + 3 .",
    "odd - even pattern + 4 .",
    "local - gain correction + 5 .",
    "flatfield correction + 6 .",
    "geometric distortion correction + 7 .",
    "radiometric calibration    if at a later time , an improvement in any one of these procedures is possible , then either the raw data can be reprocessed with the improved algorithm or the existing correction must be re - tracked to the problematic procedure that has to be replaced and re - run together with those following in the sequence .",
    "all information needed for the re - tracking is documented in the fits header of l1 data .",
    "in addition to these procedures that affect the pixel values themselves , we also mention procedures that are to be used for special analyses , but have not been applied to the archive data .",
    "these are procedures to compensate for the instrumental effect on the width of spectral lines , to compute the movement of the slit image as parasitic effect of the grating focus mechanism , to estimate the stray - light level in off - limb spectra , and give information on the wavelength calibration including thermo - elastic deformation effects along the spectral dimension .",
    "the instrument is described in @xcite .",
    "performance details are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the concept of the instrument is also discussed and reviewed in the general context of vuv space instrumentation in @xcite .",
    "a survey of the most significant results is found in @xcite . here",
    "we emphasize those details that are relevant to the archive .",
    "the particular spectral range that is covered by sumer comprises emission lines and continua of many elements .",
    "it includes the entire lyman series of hydrogen and chromospheric emission from other atomic constituents , as well as emission lines useful for observations of transition - region or coronal phenomena .",
    "it turned out that forbidden transitions between high - lying levels of highly ionized iron and other heavy species can be used as proxies for x - ray radiation and tracers of processes during flare events @xcite , thus supporting x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "the optical design of the instrument is shown in figure  [ fig : opt ] and discussed in @xcite .",
    "many features hereof are relevant for instrumental effects and are important for the data reduction . the optical system is based on a normal - incidence off - axis telescope and a slit spectrometer in wadsworth mount .",
    "pointing is accomplished by two nested mechanisms that allow , for optical performance reasons , a spherical motion of the parabolic mirror around the changeable slit in the focal plane . the beam issued from the slit  entrance of the spectrometer  is collimated by an off - axis parabolic mirror .",
    "the collimated beam is seen by a spherical concave grating producing a stigmatic image of the slit that is dispersed in wavelength .",
    "a plane mirror in front of the grating allows us to change the angle of incidence and thus , to modify the setting of the instantaneous wavelength portion seen by the detectors in the focal plane of the grating .",
    "the effective focal length of the grating depends on the angle of incidence and thus on the wavelength setting .",
    "a grating focus mechanism is , therefore , needed to keep the spectral image on the detector always in focus .",
    "for this reason , important optical parameters are wavelength dependent , notably the magnification , the angular pixel size along the slit , and the dispersion defining the spectral pixel size .",
    "all these parameters are provided in the fits header of the data files .",
    "the reduction of scattered light has been a strong requirement for the optical system and the surface quality of the optical components with chemical - vapor - deposited ( cvd ) silicon carbide ( sic ) coated surfaces .",
    "measurements of the surface roughness performed at gsfc ( saha and leviton , 1993 ) have shown that the rms micro - roughness at 10 @xmath0 m scaling length was 0.6  nm , which is well within the specification .",
    "such measurements have been used to predict the scatter performance at fuv wavelengths .",
    "sumer is equipped with seven mechanisms , the door mechanism , two mechanisms for pointing in azimuth and elevation , the slit changer , the telescope focus mechanism , the wavelength scan , and the grating focus .",
    "all mechanisms are actuated by stepper motors and have position encoders for monitoring purposes .",
    "the encoders are operated in open - loop modes , _",
    "i.e. _ , the positions that are read out are telemetered as housekeeping values , but not used to control the stepper motors .      with incremental single steps of 0.38 both in azimuth and elevation , the telescope could be pointed anywhere in the field of view of 64  @xmath1  64 centred on the sun .",
    "the azimuth drive was also used to scan regions of interest on the sun and to compensate for the solar rotation in sit - and - stare applications .",
    "the nominal elevation pointing position is always related to the central pixel of the slit , irrespective of the location of the slit image on the detector .",
    "the absolute pointing uncertainty of typically 10 is the combined result of thermoelastic effects on soho as well as in the instrument , of step losses in the mechanism , and of the parasitic shift of the slit image on the detector resulting from a misalignment of the grating focus mechanism ( as described below ) . from time to time and for special cases the solar limb was used to ` re - calibrate ' the reference position of the sumer pointing mechanism ( the zero position of the sumer coordinate system ) .",
    "when step losses of the azimuth drive occurred in october 1996 , it was decided to operate the driving motor with retaining power and in high - current mode .",
    "only sporadic step losses occurred over the succeeding years in this mode .",
    "however , in april 2008 , the problem re - appeared ex nihilo and became worse since then .",
    "raster scans could not reliably be completed anymore . with the help of the azimuth position encoder ,",
    "pointing was still possible .",
    "the value of the azimuth and elevation encoders are given in the l1 image header in order to improve the knowledge of the pointing .",
    "we note , however , that the encoder reading for the housekeeping process is completed at a cadence of 15  s and not synchronized with the science operation . with short exposure times",
    "it may happen that the encoder values in the first image header are not yet updated .      during the commissioning phase in early 1996 ,",
    "the slit focus mechanism was used to optimize the focus position of the telescope ( _ cf .",
    "the setting has not been changed since then .",
    "the slit changer can choose between the four slits of size 4  @xmath1  300 , 1  @xmath1  300 , 1  @xmath1  120 , and 0.3  @xmath1  120 .",
    "images of the short slits can be positioned in such a way that the top , the central , or the bottom section of the detector active area are illuminated , ` top ' or ` bottom ' settings are called ` asymmetric ' slit positions . in bottom position ,",
    "a baffle obscures the extreme pixels of the short slits ( # 5 and # 8) .",
    "the slit selection constrains the image format that is appropriate for the detector readout .",
    "possible image formats including their telemetry load are listed in table  [ tab : formats ] .",
    "the low telemetry rate of @xmath2  bits per second turned out to be a major limitation for fast data acquisition .",
    "faster raster scans could , however , be completed by buffering spectra into the on - board memory up to a data volume of @xmath3  bytes .",
    "rrrlr i d & spectral pixels & spatial pixels & format & tm load + & & & & s + 2 & 1024 & 360 & 1 byte & 280.9 + 3 & 1024 & 360 & 2 bytes & 561.8 + 4 & 1024 & 120 & 1 byte & 93.7 + 5 & 1024 & 120 & 2 bytes & 187.3 + 8 & 50 & 360 & 1 byte & 13.8 + 9 & 50 & 360 & 2 bytes & 27.5 + 10 & 50 & 120 & 1 byte & 4.6 + 11 & 50 & 120 & 2 bytes & 9.2 + 12 & 25 & 120 & 1 byte & 6.9 + 13 & 25 & 120 & 2 bytes & 13.8 + 14 & 25 & 120 & 1 byte & 2.3 + 15 & 25 & 120 & 2 bytes & 4.6 + 37 & 256 & 360 & 2 bytes & 140.5 + 38 & 512 & 360 & 1 byte & 140.5 + 39 & 512 & 360 & 2 bytes & 280.9 +      the optical system requires that the wavelength and grating focus mechanisms are always operated simultaneously . because of a misalignment of the grating focus drive  a combination of the misalignment of the guiding rails of the grating focus mechanism , the rotational axis of the wavelength mechanism , and the grating optical axis  the position of the slit image on the detector is slightly offset , whenever a new wavelength setting is commanded .",
    "the combined effect of this parasitic movement and the change of the angular pixel size is up to 25  pixels as shown in figure  [ fig : shift ] ( see also section  5.4 ) .",
    "since the readout window is fixed and does not follow the shift , often dark pixels appear in short - slit image formats .",
    "when only partial spectral windows are transmitted , the line of interest should in an ideal case be centred in the telemetered window .",
    "this is normally not the case and one should keep in mind that the repeatability of this mechanism is limited ( see section  5.4.1 ) . at short wavelengths , one actuator step corresponds to seven spectral pixels , while several steps are needed for a shift of one pixel at the other extreme .",
    "therefore , problems with the wavelength setting occur more often in the short wavelength range .",
    "sumer is equipped with two photon - counting detector systems .",
    "details of the detectors and their performance are given in @xcite .",
    "a triple stack of multichannel plates ( mcp ) carries the photocathode deposited on the front face of the first mcp and a cross delay - line anode converts photons to an electronic pulse .",
    "the travel time of the pulse through the crossed delay - lines determines the location of the photon event and the image is constructed by a time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) that creates a 1024  @xmath1  360 array of photon events , which we for simplification , but inaccurately call pixels .",
    "it is this analog - to - digital conversion and , in particular , the linearity of this adc which , in part , is responsible for some of the artifacts in the digital image , most notably the odd - even pattern , as described below .",
    "high overall count rates result in deadtime effects , since every individual event has to be processed by the post - anode digital electronic and bright lines will lead to local gain depression of the mcps .",
    "the adverse effects of these shortcomings are balanced or even overcompensated by a unique feature of photon counting systems : their dark signal is almost negligible so that deep exposures can be made with very low signal . in other words , the dynamic range can be extended over many orders of magnitude .    a sample spectrum around 118  nm is shown in figure  [ fig : xdl ] to illustrate the layout of the detector array .",
    "only the most prominent lines are indicated ( _ cf .",
    "* for a comprehensive line identification ) .",
    "the slit image covers only @xmath4300 out of the 360 spatial pixels .",
    "the central spectral pixels ( @xmath4280 to @xmath4770 ) represent those sections , where the kbr photocathode is deposited on the bare mcp .",
    "these pixels have a much higher sensitivity , in particular in the spectral range from 90  nm to 130  nm ( see section  6 for details ) .",
    "some pixels at the bare - to - kbr transition are difficult to interpret , since this is not a sharp boundary .",
    "the extreme 50  pixels on both sides are covered by a grid that serves as an 1:10 attenuator . however , as a side effect the attenuation exerts a modulation on the line profile , which makes it difficult to interpret these data .",
    "sumer is also equipped with a rear slit camera ( rsc ) . despite misalignment problems , which reduced the scientific value of this device",
    ", the rsc could be used to verify the pointing mechanism by locating sunspots and by observing the solar limb . in the archive ,",
    "rsc images are only included as raw data .      the principal data acquisition features of sumer are described in detail in @xcite . the instrument operation applied during the many years of observation",
    "is summarized hereafter . during several years ( 1996 to 2003 ) , the 24  h of soho throughput operation was divided in a long pass with continuous real - time access during at least 8  h and two or three small 1  h real - time passes .",
    "later , the real - time coverage was reduced and became more irregular .",
    "the round - trip time for real - time commands is about 10  s with an uplink rate of three bytes per second .",
    "the on - board sumer memory capability was 64 elementary or macro commands ( formatted as user defined programme , see the following udp section ) .",
    "so , at any time during a real - time pass we have been able to load instantaneous or time - tagged activities .",
    "the primary ground station to operate the instrument is located at the gsfc / eof ( experiment operation facility at the goddard space flight center ) . during few campaigns remote terminals at the ias / medoc ( multi - experiment data and operation centre at the institut dastrophysique spatiale )",
    "could be connected to this station . since 2011",
    "we can also operate our instrument remotely from mps .",
    "the operations were completed following a timeline comprising a time span of @xmath424  h. the definition of the timeline was accomplished in several steps .",
    "target selection was done by looking at the status of the sun with the image - tool routine .",
    "image - tool is the user interface of a pointing tool that is based on a database of solar images obtained from ground - based and space observatories , _",
    "e.g. _ soho / extreme ultraviolet imafing telescope ( eit ; delaboudinire _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) and allows fine targeting for an observation to come hours or days in advance .",
    "the choice of the feature ( coordinates and times ) to be observed was done by the sumer observer or in coordination with other soho ( or other ground - based or space observatory ) instruments .",
    "a dedicated command language has been used to define the structure and contents of observing sequences .",
    "a library of high - level functions specific to sumer and elements to build loops , branching points , etc .",
    "are the basic features of the sumer command language ( scl ) .",
    "various mapping modes and other elements of the scl library are described in @xcite .",
    "the scl source code to define an observing sequences is written in plain english .",
    "it sets the telescope pointing coordinates , the selected entrance slit of the spectrometer , the reference pixel on the detector associated with a wavelength , the wavelength and the associated windows on the detector , the exposure times , the number of spectra to be collected , and the detector voltage handling .",
    "a set of 30 differently structured , hard - wired observing sequences , so - called predefined observational programmes ( pops ) was already included in the sumer flight software .",
    "some had a simple linear structure , but more complex ones with loops and branching points were also available .",
    "in addition , new user - defined programmes ( udps ) , also written in scl code , could be added to the available pops after passing different stages of a validation process .",
    "first , the syntax was checked , then the code was compiled and converted to a token code as input to the tki ( token code interpreter ) programme , a tool that is also part of the on - board software . finally , the token code of each new udp had to pass an instrument simulator before the sequence was added to the pool of more than 1000 validated udps .",
    "in addition to the pops , the token code of 16 different udps could be held on board at the same time .",
    "unfortunately , a flaw in the detector communication occasionally terminated the full execution of a pop .",
    "mitigation of this problem required to modify the hard - wired structure of the code and this could only be completed by rewriting the sequence as udp .",
    "the availability of such user - defined sequences demonstrated the enormous flexibility of the software design and turned out to be highly appropriate for the operation of sumer .",
    "most of the time , sumer was operated in this mode .",
    "any spectrum in the archive is linked to its ` mother ' udp , which is kept in the udp database ( _ cf .",
    "_ , section  2.6 ) .",
    "the prepared observation programmes are inserted into the sumer planning tool , which can generate a file of time - tagged execution commands to be sent to the sumer on - board computer through a soho channel opened by the soho / eof ground system . at the same time",
    ", an activity plan can be produced to be loaded into the soho activity data base , documenting the plan to be executed .      a few seconds after the observation the real - time data are collected and displayed on ground computers ( eof , medoc , mps ) .",
    "few minutes after the data are taken , they are pre - processed using a quick - look facility to follow the progress of the observations . that has been very useful in order to react in near real - time to the selection of sunspot coordinates , the solar limb position ( using the rear slit camera ) or the selection of any solar feature within a raster scan image . in parallel house keeping data are received in real - time and are used to follow the instrument parameter and to detect any anomaly that requires an operator reaction , either to check the accomplishment of the programme and re - iterate the observation as needed or to optimize parameters for a secondary run of that programme .      the ground support facilities were built as a dual electrical ground support equipment ( egse ) : a scientific egse based on a vms operating system ( here referenced as operation station ) and a pc - based maintenance egse .",
    "the maintenance egse is used for real - time commanding and real - time visualization of scientific and housekeeping data necessary to check the health of the instrument and the running of the observational programme .",
    "the operation station was used to complete scientific observations : target selection , creation of udp , insertion of individual commands and programmes in the time line through the planning tool , sending the commands , reception of the telemetry , pre - processing the raw scientific data in the quick - look and formatting the zero level fits ( fts ) data to feed the preliminary soho archive .",
    "the dual egse was duplicated at the ias / medoc centre .",
    "the source code of all used udps is accessible on the mps sumer archive web page .",
    "these files are not needed directly for the fits formatting process .",
    "information about , which programme is used to acquire the dataset is included in the fits image header ( see section  [ sec : aux ] ) .",
    "the sumer archive is part of the total soho archive which is built around the archive created by all soho instruments .",
    "the main soho archive is based at nasa / gsfc , while a copy is maintained at esa and at ias / medoc .",
    "the access to the sumer lz archive can be accomplished through various web pages .",
    "in this chapter it is described which data sources are included in the processing from tm raw data to the ready fits product . further on it describes the various additional data sources which are processed and how this information is added to the fits image header . a flow diagram showing the data sources and processing steps",
    "is depicted in figure  [ fig : dataflow ] .",
    "the soho telemetry data is distributed in files which contain the data of one day ( see soho interface control document ) . for sumer",
    "there are three different kinds of file , standard housekeeping data called hk0 and science low and high rate files .",
    "the hk0 data are extracted out of the tm files and written , also on a daily base , into binary files .",
    "this is more or less a copy process .",
    "processing the science data needs considerably more effort , since the sumer image data packets are interlaced with science housekeeping packets ( _ e.g. _ hk255 , see sumer operations guide , chapter  5 for more detailed information ) . during processing the various packets",
    "are extracted and , depending on the type , are sorted into binary files for hk and images .",
    "the produced binary hk0 , science hk , and image files build the base for all further processing and sumer data products .",
    "the main sources of sumer data are the soho / sumer telemetry ( tm ) files .",
    "these files consist of a header , the tm packets , information about telemetry gaps and information about the transmission quality of the packet as listed below .",
    "the gap and quality information are added to the sumer image header in the flags qac and mdu .",
    "if the qac flag is set it means that during transmission an error occurred .",
    "when the mdu flag is set it means , there are tm packets missing and the image contains fill data at these positions .",
    "the fill data is chosen as the max value in the image .",
    "for traceability of the data processing , the name of the tm source file is added to the fits header .",

    "_ , section  [ sec : fitslzfile ] * this extension includes the radiometry arrays for first and second order .",
    "since only one radiometric calibration can be performed on the data at a time , the purpose of this data arrays is to be able to reverse the actual radiometric calibration ( indicated in keyword radorder ) and perform the other one - if available .",
    "the number of available orders / arrays is indicated in the keyword avarado .",
    "the idl routines used for the fits creation and calibration processing check on various fits keywords for processing conditions and if processing can be performed on the specified data set .",
    "the routines also record performed processing steps in fits keywords , so a processing step can not accidently be performed twice on the data .",
    "scientists all over the world who have been using sumer data have , sharing their experience , contributed to this work ( _ cf .",
    "_ , figure  [ fig : publ ] ) .",
    "the benefits of this long learning process are comprised in the sumer archive . here",
    ", we have made an effort to describe the non - trivial task of processing these data in great detail and in a transparent manner .",
    "the trend in figure  [ fig : publ ] clearly indicates that there is still interest in sumer data and that it is realistic to assume that future work will come .",
    "it is our intention to encourage future users to take advantage of such ready - to - use data that is not dependant on computer systems .",
    "sumer is now close to end of the operational life time .",
    "therefore , in the future the archive will  with the exception of _ interface region imaging spectrograph _ ( iris ; depontieu _ et al._. , 2012 ) spectra  be the only source of data in the sumer spectral range .",
