    "the influence of a time - dependent electric field on properties of a quantum mechanical system is the topic of active recent research .",
    "an essential point in these investigations is that the time - dependent field is not from the beginning treated in perturbation theory ( e.g. in linear response ) , but is rather considered as inherent part of the system itself . by this , one has to deal with conditions of a non - equilibrium situation under which the quantity of interest , e.g. a tunnel current or the response to an additional dc field , has to be determined .",
    "there is a considerable variety of physical systems studied so far .",
    "many works are related to tunneling , such as driven quartic double wells @xcite , driven quantum wells @xcite or tunneling through laser irradiated wells @xcite . in interacting systems , investigations concentrated on tunneling through quantum dots in time - varying fields @xcite .",
    "another class of investigations are related to transport experiments as , e.g. , in the quantum hall regime @xcite , where a microwave gives rise to peculiar changes of the dc conductivities .",
    "calculations have been done on photo - induced transport through quantum point contacts @xcite , or on microwave induced changes of the dc conductivity of a disordered system @xcite .",
    "recently , holthaus and hone @xcite studied the wannier - stark ladder in an ac - driven one - dimensional tight- binding system , where in presence of disorder - induced localization the localization length is controlled by the time - dependent field .    in spite of this great variety of investigations ,",
    "the main theoretical focus so far has been on the zero- or ( quasi ) one - dimensional case .",
    "it is therefore desirable to develop a calculation scheme that is applicable in higher dimensions and for arbitrary static potentials , in particular in view of applications as the quantum hall effect ( @xmath0 ) or the anderson transition ( @xmath1 ) . in this paper",
    ", we set up a general formalism to calculate the green s function of non  interacting electrons moving in an arbitrary static potential under the influence of a time ",
    "dependent electric field with frequency @xmath2 .",
    "we use the dyson equation to obtain the keldysh green s function in two different calculation schemes .",
    "first , we regard the static potential as a perturbation and include the electric field in the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "we give a formally exact solution which can be evaluated approximately by inverting a truncated matrix containing a finite number of photo - blocks. the advantage of this method is its exactness in the electric field ; it furthermore sums up the static potential to infinite order and is perturbative in the higher _ fourier components _ of the green s function which correspond to the center  of  mass time coordinate .",
    "numerical examples of this truncation method are presented for the trivial case of a constant potential , which allows comparison to an exact result , and a simple model for the transmission through a double barrier structure in a strong electric field . there",
    ", our method qualitatively reproduces previous results by other authors @xcite .",
    "in particular , the examples show that already a small number of photo - blocks is sufficient to obtain convergence .",
    "second , starting from the exact eigenstates of the static potential , again an exact formal solution is derived in which the green s function is represented as the inverse of an infinite tridiagonal matrix , which is the green s function analogue of the floquet state hamiltonian .",
    "this approach in particular is useful in situations where the static scattering problem is already solved ( say by numerical diagonalization ) and one is interested in the effect of an additional , time - dependent electric field .",
    "we calculate the electron self energy of which the diagonal part yields an inelastic scattering time @xmath3 due to the influence of the electric field . in the limit of @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the fermi level of the system without electric field )",
    "we obtain an exact relation between @xmath3 and the zero temperature ac - conductivity of the system without electric field .",
    "we calculate @xmath3 for microwave radiation in the integer quantum hall effect . from the fact that @xmath3 alone is insufficient to interpret experimental data",
    ", we conclude that one rather has to investigate the full green s function in presence of the time  dependent electric field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ generalformulation ]",
    ", we set up the general formalism ( dyson s equation ) , in section [ ip ] we specify to the plane wave basis and derive the exact expression for the green s function which is evaluated numerically . in section [ fieldperturbation ] , we give a formulation in the eigenstate basis of the static potential and discuss the electric field induced scattering rate , which again is derived from the formally exact result .",
    "a short conclusion is given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the starting point in each of our approaches is the dyson equation for the keldysh green s function matrices .",
    "we start from a basis of eigenstates labeled with @xmath6 and define green s functions @xcite @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) denote ( anti)-chronological time ordering .",
    "furthermore , the brackets @xmath13 denote as usual an average over a quantum state of the system ( not necessarily the stationary state ) .",
    "the green s functions are written in a matrix block @xmath14 for which the dyson - integral equation has the same form as in equilibrium theory , @xmath15 where the matrix @xmath16 is composed of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , in analogy to eq .",

    "this splitting defines the way the perturbation theory is performed and will be explained below .",
    "since we are interested in a hamiltonian a part of which oscillates with frequency @xmath2 , it is useful to perform a fourier analysis according to time center of mass and relative coordinates (  wigner  coordinates  ) , namely @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this decomposition is defined according to @xmath27 and correspondingly for @xmath21 and @xmath28 .",
    "the inverse transformation is @xmath29 of special interest is the component @xmath30 which determines the average over the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath11 . in particular , in the case of an equilibrium situation ( no electric field ) , all components @xmath31 with @xmath32 vanish because the green s function depends on the relative coordinate @xmath26 only .    inserting eq .",

    "( [ dyson ] ) , a straightforward calculation yields @xmath33 in this paper , we concentrate on the non- interacting case where the perturbation is a one - particle operator and the self energy is ( keldysh ) block - diagonal @xcite @xmath34 an impurity average effectively introduces interactions among the electrons and the self energy becomes different from eq .",

    "additional _ energy through the electric field is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the bandmass , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 the number of electrons in the system .",
    "we explicitely note that although the electric field @xmath52 is homogeneous , in an alternative gauge a corresponding _ scalar potential _ would be linear in the space coordinate , namely @xmath53 , an oscillating slanted surface.    by gauge invariance , the current density operator is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the ( paramagnetic ) current density operator in the absence of the electric field , and @xmath56 the electronic density .    in second quantization and in an basis of eigenstates @xmath57 with eigenenergies @xmath58 , the electric field gives rise to an additional hamiltonian @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is the component of the electron velocity operator in direction @xmath40 .",
    "note that the coupling is effectively to the velocity and not to the current density operator since we assumed spatial homogeneity of the electric field .",
    "care has to be taken when calculating green s functions in a specific gauge , as has been pointed out by bertoncini and jauho @xcite . since only gauge - invariant quantities are meaningful for comparison with experiments , one has to formulate a gauge - invariant theory .",

    "an obvious approximation would be to neglect all @xmath32 components at all , i.e. to neglect the center - of - mass time coordinate .",

    "the latter was used to derive a relation between the rate for ( inelastic ) scattering induced by the time dependent field , and the ac conductivity in absence of the field .",
    "application to microwave experiments in the integer quantum hall effect suggested , however , that rather than the microwave scattering rate the full green s function in the basis of the scattering states has to be investigated .    although in both methods exact solutions were derived , the numerical applicability suggests that the first approach is appropriate for relatively simple static potentials and strong electric fields .",
