    "recent observations of the radial gas density profiles interior to the asymmetries have found that some of these regions are depleted , favouring the latter idea that planet - induced vortices are responsible for the asymmetric structures in some transition discs @xcite . in this case , a giant planet clears out a gap in the disc , creating sharp peaks in the radial density profile at the gap edges .",

    "although this phase can be fast compared to the timescale needed for envelope accretion prior to runaway growth , it is limited by the depleted gas supply in the planet s vicinity once it opens up a gap ( e.g * ? ? ?",

    ".planet growth times for each of the four cases in our simulations . [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : simulations ]      to quantify the vortex properties as a function of the planet s growth time ( @xmath12 ) , we need a robust method to identify when they form and dissipate .",
    "quantitative definitions are especially important since many of the vortices generated across our parameter space are weak .",
    "we find that the magnitude of the overdensity within the vortex is the best tracer of formation and lifetime .",
    "while the planet also produces density enhancements in its spiral wake , these remain fixed in the planet s co - rotating frame . on the contrary , a vortex orbits at its local keplerian frequency several hill radii away from the planet .",
    "this difference allows us to differentiate the vortex over - density from the spiral density waves .",
    "we isolate the vortex ( with its distinct keplerian orbital frequency ) from the spiral density waves ( co - rotating with the planet ) by differencing the surface density fields at successive planet orbits when the planet is at the same location .",
    "we find this procedure to be effective in removing the co - rotational features , leaving only the vortices present in the positive component of the differenced surface density .",
    "we then combine all of the positive contributions and define this mass to be the total mass in the vortex , @xmath50 .",
    "we use this  excess mass \" to quantitatively determine when a planet triggers the rwi and when a vortex dissipates .",
    "we numerically identify when the rwi is first triggered as the first orbit at which there is a sharp increase in the growth rate of @xmath51 , that is , when it begins to increase roughly exponentially .",
    "these times are straightforward to identify from the evolution of the growth rates over time . for a given disc viscosity @xmath52",
    ", we find that these times correspond to a very narrow range of trigger masses across our parameter space . as a result",
    ", we do not need a more precise quantitative definition of the trigger point .",
    "while vortices are easy to identify at their peak intensity , pinpointing the orbit at which they disappear is challenging .",
    "vortices can persist at very low mean densities for hundreds of orbits .",
    "thus , we quantify their lifetime based on when they have lost most of their excess mass , specifically when @xmath53 , which corresponds to a @xmath54 reduction from their peak mass . for the less concentrated vortices with which we are most concerned in this work , the choice of a threshold mass does not have a significant effect on vortex lifetimes .",
    "although it might seem natural to include a quantitative measure of vorticity in our definition of vortex formation and dissipation , we found this to be less reliable .",
    "this is because other features at the gap edge also produce spikes in vorticity that make it more difficult to differentiate the vortex s vorticity from that of nearby parts of the disc .",
    "we characterize a vortex s strength by quantifying its surface density and azimuthal extent . in general , stronger long - lived vortices have higher surface densities and more concentrated azimuthal extents .",
    "we measure the maximum gas concentration a vortex attains during its lifetime through its peak surface density , @xmath55 .",
    "this is the maximum value of @xmath56 over time , where @xmath57 is the orbital radius at which there is a local maximum in the outer disc ( @xmath29 ) in the azimuthally - averaged surface density profile corresponding to the radius of the vortex ; and @xmath58 is the azimuth at which @xmath59 $ ] occurs .",
    "we apply a smoothing filter over 5 orbits before maximizing these values over time .",
    "this removes short timescale variations , such as those due the planet s wake .",
    "we choose to use the vortex s maximum surface density rather than its average surface density to avoid the difficulty of tracing out the edges of the vortex , which can be ambiguous in many snapshots .",
    "nonetheless , we estimate that the vortex s average surface density is smaller than its maximum surface density by @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "we estimate a vortex s azimuthal extent , denoted as @xmath62 , by examining @xmath63 over a wide range of snapshots .",
    "we find that a vortex s azimuthal extent is the most concentrated near the time at which its surface density is maximized .",
    "for this reason , we characterize a vortex s concentration by the minimum value of @xmath62 over time , denoted as @xmath64_\\mathrm{min}$ ] .",
    "they are rounded to the nearest @xmath65 , and primarily intended to classify a vortex as  concentrated \" ( @xmath64_\\mathrm{min } < 180^{\\circ}$ ] ) ,  elongated \" ( @xmath64_\\mathrm{min } > 180^{\\circ}$ ] ) , or ",
    "intermediate \" ( @xmath66_\\mathrm{min } \\approx 180^{\\circ}$ ] ) .",
    "section  [ ssec : dust ] also uses these rough values to show how vortices with different gas azimuthal extents appear in the associated dust observations .",
    "our simulations show that planets with longer , more realistic growth times induce vortices with :    1 .",
    "shorter vortex lifetimes , 2 .",
    "lower vortex peak surface densities , and 3 .   wider vortex azimuthal extents .",
    "we summarize these trends in figure [ fig : comparisons ] .",
    "we can interpret these results by first considering the gap - opening process , which begins before the rwi is triggered . according to @xcite ,",
    "planets open gaps when @xmath67 where the reynolds number @xmath68 is the reciprocal of our dimensionless viscosity .",
    "equation [ eq : crida ] implies gap opening masses of @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively .",
    "these are well below the final planet masses in our simulations .",
    "this suggests that the planet can trigger vortices through the rwi _ during _ its growth phase when its mass is still relatively small .",
    "this is distinct from previous simulations of planets of at least jupiter - mass where the planet reaches its full mass almost immediately _ after _ vortices form ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    indeed , using @xmath50 shown in figure [ fig : growth ]",
    " our measure of vortex presence  we find that the first spike in @xmath50 occurs when @xmath73 for @xmath71 , and at roughly @xmath74 for @xmath75 , both independent of @xmath12 .",
    "these values of @xmath8 are close to the gap - opening masses @xmath76 estimated above , suggesting that the rwi develops soon after gap - opening begins .",
    "once the rwi is triggered , @xmath50 enters a short exponential growth phase lasting for @xmath77 orbits .",
    "we find this timescale , @xmath78 , is also approximately the time it takes for the initial vortices to merge into a single vortex ( azimuthal wavenumber @xmath79 ) , and that @xmath80 does not vary significantly with @xmath81 .    despite similar trigger masses and exponential growth phases , the resulting vortices are in fact quite different .",
    "this difference arises because once the vortex emerges , it begins to back - react on the gap edge , smoothing it out .",
    "the growing planet competes against the already - present vortex to sharpen the gap edge .",
    "@xcite show that the ratio of surface density at the gap centre , @xmath82 to that at the gap edge , @xmath83 , depends on planet mass and reynolds numbers as : @xmath84 for a growing planet , we expect the steepness of the gap edge to evolve on a timescale of order @xmath85 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : extents ] , we show that the azimuthal extent of vortices is well divided in a parameter space @xmath86 vs. @xmath87 , where angle brackets represent a time average .",
    "specifically , the properties of the vortex depend on both the steepness of the gap edge and how quickly the gap edge evolves .",
    "this dependence reflects the competition between @xmath88 , the timescale for gap sculpting ; and @xmath78 , the roughly constant timescale which governs how quickly the vortex can back - react on the gap . to verify the robustness of our choice of dimensionless numbers to map vortex properties , we ran short - term simulations with different combinations of @xmath39 and @xmath52 that more densely sample @xmath86 , and overlap with values already in our full length parameter study .",
    "we find excellent consistency between vortex azimuthal extents in the overlapping cases .",
    "when @xmath89 ( that is , for slow planet growth ) , the vortex begins to smooth out the gap edge while the planet is still at a low mass , preventing the gap edge from attaining the maximum steepness for a given pair of @xmath39 and @xmath90 .",
    "this leads to the vortex having a smaller saturation amplitude in density and a less concentrated azimuthal extent .",
    "when @xmath91 , the planet grows quickly , continually steepening the gap edge .",
    "thus , the back - reaction from the vortex only becomes important when the planet is more massive and the gap edge sharper .",
    "the resulting vortex is stronger and more concentrated .    for more massive planets with larger @xmath92",
    ", we observe that the azimuthal extent of a vortex can evolve from `` elongated '' to `` intermediate . ''",
    "this behavior arises because the planet continues to steepen the gap edge long after the exponential growth phase of @xmath93 . as a result",
    ", the slope of the dividing line in figure [ fig : extents ] is positive .",
    "we emphasize that the largest distinction between the vortices is their azimuthal extents , rather than their peak mass or saturation amplitude .",
    "this is consistent with the linear scaling between the rwi growth rate and saturation amplitude found by @xcite .                with this interpretation in hand ,",
    "we now provide more detailed descriptions of the different cases .",

    "lastly , we show that the underlying trends in our results converge at different resolutions in section  [ ssec : resolution ] .    .",

    ". nevertheless , these vortices are still weaker than those produced by a rapidly - grown planet .",

    "even though the rwi is triggered with high-@xmath113 azimuthal modes , we do not observe them to evolve and merge into a clear @xmath114 vortex .",
    "in the rapid growth case where @xmath99 , we find that jupiter - mass planets in discs with a low viscosity ( @xmath100 ) also induce strong , concentrated vortices .",
    "these vortices have relatively long lifetimes of several thousand orbits , which is consistent with previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and only about a factor of @xmath116 shorter than those with the higher mass planet .",

    "when a vortex is initially weak , it can fade into a ring before the planet reaches its final mass .",
    "since the planet continues to clear out the gap as it grows , these rings can develop sufficiently steep edges to re - trigger the rwi and form a new vortex .",

    ", the dust extents can not be used to measure the gas extents directly since the dust concentrations approach zero inside the outer edge of the vortex .",
    "instead , we find that the slopes of these steeper azimuthal distributions are a better indicator of the gas azimuthal extent .",
    "however , the differences in these slopes for vortices with different azimuthal extents can be very small ( @xmath153 ) when the distributions are normalized to the density at the vortex centre , making the extents difficult to measure precisely with this size particle .",
    "this simplified model illustrates that two types of vortices might be distinguishable at mm wavelengths .",
    "we expect that the dust overdensities shown in figure [ fig : dust ] are likely underestimates of the observable asymmetry , as we have not accounted for the removal of dust elsewhere along the azimuth at the radial location of the vortex",
    ". however , the simulated vortices have more complicated streamline and density structures at their outer edges , which might make dust trapping less effective . a more detailed dust - trapping model that is more appropriate for elongated vortices",
    "is needed to better assess the viability of measuring a vortex s azimuthal extent for constraining the associated planet s growth timescale .",
    "we have shown that planets must form within a few thousand orbits or less in order to induce long - lived vortices .",
    "we now compare these timescales with realistic growth rates from planet formation models , finding that extreme conditions are required to satisfy the growth rate constraint .",
    "first , we consider the fastest possible accretion rates .",
    "a strong upper limit on the planet s growth is set by allowing the planet to efficiently accrete from its feeding zone in the 2d limit as @xmath154 to evaluate this rate , we assume a surface density profile from @xcite that is proportional to the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) , @xmath155 where @xmath156 is an enhancement factor ( @xmath157 refers to the mmsn ) . with this profile ,",
    "the maximum growth rate of the planet is @xmath158 where we have used the value of @xmath159 for the hill radius scaling as the planet can not initially accrete from the hill radius corresponding to its final mass .",
    "this upper limit corresponds to @xmath160 for a jupiter - mass planet that forms at 5 au in the mmsn .",
    "this timescale is safely an order of magnitude shorter than the critical growth rate required for vortex formation in our models ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "thus , if planets were able to accrete at this maximal rate , vortex formation would be robust .",
    "however , achieving these maximum growth rates is unlikely when a planet has already opened up a gap , which occurs at a relatively low mass in a low viscosity disc . a second simple estimate for planet growth time",
    "can be derived from considering the background accretion rate through the disc . in a steady state",
    ", we expect the disc to funnel material into the vicinity of the planet at disc accretion rate @xmath162 . since we expect @xmath163 , for low viscosity discs the background accretion rate sets a more stringent limit on the planet growth times than the estimate above .",
    "equating the disc accretion rate to the planet growth rate , we define the critical surface density for vortex formation to be @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the critical planet growth rate that leads to vortex formation ( which is a function of @xmath166 and @xmath52 ) . as above , we scale @xmath167 to the mmsn to obtain @xmath168 , the enhancement over the mmsn required to allow sufficiently rapid accretion to induce vortex formation .",
    "we find @xmath169 aside from the discrepancy with observed disc masses @xcite , this very high surface density is incompatible with the assumption of a low disc viscosity , because it corresponds to a disc with a small toomre @xmath170 . for the passive irradiated disc profile from @xcite ( see their eq .",
    "14a ) with @xmath171 where @xmath172 is midplane temperature at 5 au in the fiducial t - tauri irradiation model , @xmath173 discs with @xmath174 are subject to gravitational instabilities that generate effective @xmath175 or @xmath176 @xcite . even for a factor of @xmath177 decrease in @xmath178",
    "( increase in @xmath170 ) , disc self - gravity may suppress large - scale vortex formation via the rwi @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the planet growth rates required for vortex formation are incompatible with growth via mass re - supply from the disc .",
    "neither of the above estimates captures the details of planetary accretion .",
    "more realistic simulations of jupiter s formation that account for gap opening and feedback produce accretion rates in line with our second estimate , which is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude slower than the rates needed for robust vortex formation .",
    "@xcite model the growth of a @xmath94 planet at 5  au in a disc with @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "they find that the runaway gas accretion phase lasts for @xmath181 in the simulation they deem the most realistic .",
    "neglecting disc dispersal , they estimate growth times of @xmath182 . at even this faster rate ,",
    "our simulations predict that vortex formation would be inhibited .",
    "more detailed models of accretion through circumplanetary discs produce similarly low accretion rates , and thus slow growth times .",
    "again , for planet properties akin to jupiter , studies find @xmath183 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "if circumplanetary disc accretion rates were only weakly dependent on planet semi - major axis , this would favour vortex formation at larger disc radii .",
    "although our calculations above suggest that realistic planet growth times are slow , vortex formation may still be possible with less idealized disc conditions .",
    "for example , secondary effects such as the efficient heating of material in the vicinity of an accreting planet ( which we neglect in our isothermal discs ) has been shown to help vortex formation and survival @xcite .",
    "even if the inclusion of more rigorous thermodynamics could ameliorate the inhibition of the instability caused by slow planet growth times , vortices induced by slowly growing giant planets should still be subject to the vortex back - reaction effects that lower their overdensities , widen their azimuthal extents , and shorten their lifetimes as in our study . as discussed in section  [ ssec : comparisons ] , these characteristics each likely severely damp prospects for observing vortices .",
    "in this paper , we explore the impact of a planet s growth timescale on the properties of vortices induced at the outer gap edge through the rossby wave instability .",
    "we find that the values of @xmath81 needed for the formation of long - lived planet - induced vortices are short compared to those expected from core accretion models or mass resupply in a low - viscosity disc .",
    "even with modest values of @xmath184 , the resulting vortices have lower gas densities , more elongated azimuthal extents , and shorter lifetimes that are less than half their survival times with rapid planet growth .",
    "this is in contrast to vortex lifetimes on the order of @xmath185 to @xmath102 obtained with @xmath186 in previous studies ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with increased planet growth timescales",
    ", we find the rwi is in fact triggered soon after the planet mass reaches the gap - opening criterion from @xcite , which is well below the final planet masses studied here .",
    "although the vortex evolution at the trigger point is not sensitive to @xmath81 , the planet growth timescale strongly affects the saturated state of the vortex .",
    "we attribute the transition to weaker vortex properties to the competition between the timescale on which the vortex smooths the gap edge as compared to the timescale on which the growing planet steepens it .",
    "we also map out this transition as a function of the dimensionless planet mass growth rate @xmath187 , and a dimensionless measure of gap - edge steepness @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the reynolds number @xcite .",
    "if the initial vortex forms when the planet is relatively low in mass , the vortex back - reaction on the gap structure is more pronounced , stunting any further growth of the vortex during subsequent planet growth .",
    "conversely , a short @xmath81 allows the planet to sculpt the gap edge much faster than the vortex can back - react on it .",
    "a unique feature of the vortices induced by slowly - grown planets are their much wider azimuthal extents , which can be twice that of vortices induced by rapidly - grown planets .",
    "we caution that these elongated vortices ( in particular , those induced by lower mass planets ) may not survive as long as in our standard resolution simulations , since their lifetimes are halved in our higher resolution simulations .    if such elongated vortices survive long enough to be observable , we can measure their azimuthal extents from dust observations .",
    "since a planet s growth timescale preferentially affects the azimuthal extents of the vortex it creates , a measurement of a vortex s azimuthal extent could be used in conjunction with other properties ( such as the planet s mass , along with the disc s viscosity and temperature ) to provide limits on how quickly the associated planet formed .",
    "other effects that weaken vortices and cause them to be shorter - lived ( such as sub - optimal disc temperatures and viscosities , and dust feedback ) do not affect their extents nearly as much as the planet s growth rate .",
    "a low - viscosity disc is generally required for planet - induced vortex formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the disc viscosity also limits the accretion rate onto the planet , thereby increasing its growth timescale . in this regime ,",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath81 prevent a planet from inducing a long - lived vortex . if the asymmetric discs observed with alma are induced by vortices from giant planets",
    ", more detailed thermodynamics may need to be incorporated into future simulations to model them properly .",
    "accounting for the disc cooling timescale or planetary accretion luminosity may lead to stronger vortices even with slow growth rates @xcite    finally , we note that vortices associated with dead zone boundaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are also expected to be elongated . as a result",
    ", one would not be able to distinguish the origin of elongated vortices ( as induced by a dead zone boundary or a slowly - grown planet ) based on azimuthal extent alone .",
