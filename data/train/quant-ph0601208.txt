    "the study of entanglement has emerged as a central theme of quantum physics in recent years . it is driven both by fundamental questions and by the increasing interest in applications that go beyond the limit of classical physics .",
    "entanglement as a measurable quantity is a complicated subject , in particular when the systems have multiple components .",
    "here we choose to study entanglement and its possible avenues of quantification in an open quantum system .",
    "this system , the canonical model of cavity qed @xcite , has a single atom coupled to the mode of an optical cavity with two reservoirs or avenues for extracting information : spontaneous emission and losses from the cavity .",
    "two particles ( or systems ) , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are said to be in an entangled state if the wave function of the complete system does not factorize , that is @xmath2 .",
    "one consequence of this form of the wavefunction is that a measurement on system @xmath0 yields information about system @xmath1 without any direct interaction with system @xmath1 . for systems with the same dimension ,",
    "in particular , a ( pure ) state is said to be maximally entangled if tracing over one of the two systems , say @xmath0 , leaves the other one in a totally mixed state ; this means that one can gain complete knowledge of system @xmath1 by performing measurements on @xmath0 only .",
    "an example that is of relevance to this work is the maximally entangled state of an atom and a field mode , @xmath3 with the first index denoting the number of photons in the field mode and the second ( @xmath4 ) denoting the state of the atom .",
    "a measurement of the state of the atom immediately tells us the number of photons in the field mode ; or a measurement of the photon number immediately tells us the state of the atom .",
    "the von neumann entropy @xmath5 of the reduced density matrix of system @xmath0 , @xmath6 @xcite quantifies the amount of entanglement in a given bipartite quantum system in a pure state . for mixed states , on the other hand , although it is easy enough to define what is meant by a totally unentangled state ",
    "namely , one in which it is possible to represent the density operator as an incoherent superposition of factorizable states  quantifying the amount of entanglement in a partially entangled state is not , in general , simple .",
    "the natural generalization of the pure - state measure indicated above , known as the entanglement of formation , utilizes a decomposition of the quantum state @xmath7 , and then defines @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the von neumann entropy for the density matrix @xmath10 , and the minimum is taken over all the possible decompositions , which is in general a very challenging task @xcite . as a result of this ,",
    "alternative measures have been proposed , such as the logarithmic negativity @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that some particular measurement scheme may result in a most natural unraveling of the density operator , in the sense of the quantum trajectories approach @xcite ( especially for systems that are continually monitored ) , and in that case it may be physically meaningful to focus only on the entanglement of the ( conditionally pure ) states obtained via that particular unraveling .",
    "one of the main purposes of this paper is to determine how much information about the atom - field entanglement in our canonical cavity qed system can be gleaned from the kinds of measurements represented by the traditional correlation functions of quantum optics .",
    "as we shall show below , we are actually able to avoid the difficulties for mixed - state entanglement because , in the limit we are interested in , our system is , to a good approximation , in a pure state , in spite of its being an open system interacting with two reservoirs .",
    "fig . [ cqed ] shows a two level atom in a driven optical cavity .",
    "we consider a single - ended cavity , with the intracavity field decaying via the output mirror at rate @xmath11 .",
    "the two - level atom has a spontaneous emission rate to modes out the sides of the cavity denoted by @xmath12 , which is generally less than the free space einstein @xmath0 coefficient .",
    "the resonant coupling between the atom and the field mode is given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 the electric dipole matrix element , @xmath15 the transition frequency and @xmath16 the volume of the cavity mode .",
    "the driving field is taken to be a large classical field @xmath17 incident on the input mirror , with small transmission @xmath18 , so that the incident flux ( in photon units ) inside the cavity is proportional to @xmath19    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the concurrence shows its sensitivity to different parameters .",
    "[ contour - nvr ] shows a contour plot of @xmath20 versus @xmath21 and @xmath22 for a case where the cavity decay rate is larger than the spontaneous emission rate ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the entanglement is largest near @xmath24 , before the vacuum - rabi splitting of the spectrum , which does not occur in this case until @xmath25 , at which point the entanglement is already diminishing .",
    "the size of the maximum concurrence decreases by increasing @xmath26 from @xmath27 to @xmath28 by a factor of about 30 .",
    "the calculation of entanglement leads now to the question of how to implement measurements that give the full information in the case of this cavity qed system under weak excitation .",
    "the previous section shows that the concurrence is related to the rate of single photon counts out of the cavity or in fluorescence and to the rate of coincident counts from the cavity and fluorescence .",
    "these are the quantities associated in quantum optics with correlation functions , first introduced by glauber @xcite .",
    "generally these correlation functions involve comparing a field ( intensity ) of one mode with the field ( intensity ) of the same mode at a later time ( or different spatial location ) , with some exceptions @xcite",
    ". however , entanglement in cavity qed has two components : atom and cavity mode .",
    "it is natural to look at cross correlations between the cavity mode and the fluorescent light that falls in the mode of the detector .",
    "consider a general cross - correlation function for two - modes of the electromagnetic field : @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 well behaved functions , in the sense of a convergent taylor series on the hilbert space of interest . if @xmath32 is a product state , the correlation function @xmath33 factorizes and then is unity .",
    "if it is _ not _ a product state , then this will manifest itself in a non - unit value for the normalized cross - correlation functions .    the simplest cross correlation function to consider",
    "is @xmath34 .",
    "this could be obtained by measuring the visibility of the fringe pattern formed by interfering the transmitted and fluorescent light . for the weakly driven cavity - qed system , this is @xmath35 so to lowest order , there is no information in this correlation function about entanglement .    to obtain information about entanglement",
    "the correlation function has to probe the two - excitation part of the state . a possibility to do",
    "this is the intensity cross correlation : @xmath36    this normalized correlation function is directly related to the coefficient of double excitations ( see eqs .",
    "( [ wavefunction ] ) ,  ( [ twoexitation ] ) ,  ( [ q ] ) ) . if @xmath37 then @xmath38 and there is no entanglement ; so a non - unit value of @xmath39 indicates entanglement .",
    "using second - order intensity correlations has been proposed in the context of entangled coherent states by stobiska and wdkiewicz @xcite .    the cross correlation function @xmath40 contains information about the average photon number _ in coincidence with _ a measurement of the fluorescence relative to the average photon number in the absence of any interrogation of the fluorescence .",
    "@xmath41 is an indicator of entanglement .",
    "a way to measure @xmath39 directly utilizes a field - intensity correlation function @xmath42 @xcite , that can be implemented as a homodyne measurement conditioned on the detection of a fluorescent photon , @xmath43    so @xmath44 is also an indicator of entanglement in this system .",
    "what makes this measurement possible experimentally is the conditioning that selects only times when there is a fluctuation and the rest of the time ( when the vacuum is present ) no data is collected @xcite . for one mode , the homodyned transmitted field conditioned by detection of a photon from that mode ,",
    "is a measure of squeezing in that mode @xcite .",
    "a homodyne measurement of the transmitted field conditioned by detection of a fluorescent photon is a measure of the two - mode squeezing , with the cavity field and atomic dipole as the two components .",
    "generally , two - mode squeezing is an indicator of entanglement between the two modes .",
    "gea  banacloche _ et al .",
    "_ explored this correlation function in a different regime of cavity qed and found it to be a witness of the dynamics of entanglement @xcite .",
    "non - classicality and entanglement are not necessarily simultaneously present .",
    "for example for two oscillators one could have @xmath45 , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are coherent state amplitudes . in this state , there is entanglement , but each individual mode shows no non - classical behavior .",
    "conversely , one can have non - classical behavior with no entanglement , say for example the atom in the ground state and the field in a squeezed coherent state .",
    "there is a particular form of the schwartz inequality that must be satisfied for a classical field for the specific case of the system we are considering here : @xmath46 here @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote zero delay intensity correlations for the transmitted and fluorescent fields respectively . in the one - atom limit , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , so this inequality becomes @xmath51 which depends on @xmath39 , but also on the parameter @xmath52 ( eq . ( [ p ] ) ) , which can be varied independently .",
    "there is no one - to - one relationship between schwarz inequality violations and entanglement ( by this measure ) in this particular system .",
    "we find that entanglement in weakly driven cavity qed is characterized by comparison of two - excitation probability amplitudes to single excitation amplitudes , in particular the amplitude involving one excitation in each subsystem .",
    "it is necessary to have a small saturation photon number to enhance the nonlinear response which generates a larger entanglement .",
    "but this is true only to a point .",
    "we find the maximal entanglement for small @xmath11 and when @xmath21 is on the order of unity .",
    "this stems from the dual role of the coupling @xmath53 .",
    "it couples energy into the atom , but due to cavity enhanced spontaneous emission , it can also channel energy out .    increasing @xmath12 decreases the entanglement , and",
    "this can be explained in terms of the effect of the two decay processes on the system . if we detect a fluorescent photon we know it has come from the atom , and the atom is in the ground state .",
    "if we obtain a transmitted photon , it could have been emitted from the atom into the cavity mode , or just be a driving field photon that has passed through the cavity without interaction with the atom .",
    "it is the interference of these two indistinguishable processes that leads to nonclassical effects in the transmitted field .",
    "we have found a variety of cross - correlation functions that are indicators , or witnesses , of entanglement in this system .",
    "one can learn nothing about the entanglement by examining only one- or two- excitation amplitudes separately .",
    "in particular we find that a measurement of two - mode squeezing , or a homodyne measurement of the transmitted field conditioned on the detection of a fluorescence photon is directly proportional to the entanglement calculated via the reduced von neumann entropy .",
    "further work remains to generalize this approach to situations with higher drives , but the general approach of looking at entanglement together with the specific correlation function to measure gives physical insight into this problem .",
