    "great progresses have been made since the discovery of the first feas - based pnictide superconductor lafeaso@xmath6f@xmath7 ( la-1111 system ) @xcite .",
    "similar to the high - temperature superconducting ( sc ) cuprates , the parent compounds of the iron pnictides are antiferromagnet@xcite .",
    "superconductivity can be induced by various chemical doping methods , which introduces charge carriers and suppresses the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order@xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that magnetism could play an important role to high - temperature superconductivity in both cuprates and pnictides . on the other hand",
    ", iron - based superconductors also show different behaviors from the cuprates .",
    "one of their major differences is the pairing symmetry .",
    "it has been well established that the sc pairing in cuprates is of nodal @xmath8-wave symmetry@xcite . in pnicitdes , the pairing symmetry continues to be an important and outstanding issue .",
    "the experimental evidences for full sc gaps in feas - based superconductors are mainly from the measurements of angle - resolved photoemission spectra ( arpes ) @xcite , andreev tunnelling spectra@xcite , and penetration depth@xcite . within the full gap scenario , because of the multi - band fermi surfaces@xcite , the relative phases of the sc order parameters in hole or electron pockets can be either positive ( @xmath9-wave pairing ) or negative ( @xmath5-wave pairing)@xcite , depending on the sign of the inter - fermi pocket pair scattering amplitude or their josephson coupling .",
    "the @xmath5-wave pairing is appealing with some experimental supports @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are also evidences for nodal sc gap in fep - based superconductors@xcite .",
    "the effect of non - magnetic impurity is dependent on the pairing symmetry and thus it can be used as a powerful probe to detect the pairing symmetry for unconventional superconductors .",
    "non - magnetic impurity does not cause severe pair - breaking effect in a conventional @xmath9-wave superconductor according to the anderson s theorem@xcite . in the @xmath8-wave superconducting cuprates ,",
    "even a minimal amount of non - magnetic zn doping can quench @xmath10 quickly@xcite . in the @xmath5-wave state where the order parameters in hole and electron pockets have opposite signs ,",
    "theoretical studies@xcite have predicted that non - magnetic impurities like zn can severely suppress the sc transition temperature @xmath10 , similar to the effect in high-@xmath10 cuprates with @xmath8-wave pairing .",
    "zinc element has a stable @xmath11 configuration in the alloy @xcite , and can serve as the best non - magnetic impurity for this study . however , there is a seemingly discrepancy between our early data in lafeaso@xmath12f@xmath13 , where @xmath10 is robust to zn - impurity@xcite , and a following report showed a severe suppression of @xmath10 due to zn - impurity in the oxygen - deficient lafeaso@xmath14 samples@xcite .",
    "further studies found that the effect of zn impurity on @xmath10 is strongly dependent on the charge doping level , i.e. , @xmath10 increases with zn content in the under - doped regime , remains unchanged in the optimally doped regime , and is severely suppressed in the over - doped regime in the lafe@xmath15zn@xmath2aso@xmath6f@xmath7 system@xcite .",
    "this finding reconciles the contradiction in the previous reports of zn impurity effect and strongly suggests that a switch of pairing symmetry from an impurity - insensitive state to an impurity - sensitive state is possible .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of zn impurity on superconductivity in an optimally co - doped lafe@xmath0co@xmath1zn@xmath2aso system .",
    "we found that @xmath10 is severely suppressed with addition of zn impurity although the system is in the optimally doped regime .",
    "this result is in contrast to the effect of zn impurity in optimally f - doped la-1111 system@xcite .",
    "the possible interpretations regarding to the sc pairing state are discussed .",

    "( b ) variations of lattice parameters as a function of zn content.,width=264 ]",
    "polycrystalline samples of lafe@xmath0co@xmath1zn@xmath2aso ( @xmath17 = 0 , 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.03 , 0.04 ) were synthesized by solid state reaction method .",
    "details on the sample preparation can be found in the previous report@xcite .",
    "the phase purity of the samples was investigated by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using a d / max - ra diffractometer with cu - k@xmath18 radiation and a graphite monochromator .",
    "lattice parameters were calculated by a least - squares fit using at least 20 xrd peaks .    the electrical resistivity was measured on bar - shaped samples using a standard four - probe method .",
    "the measurements of resistance and hall effect were performed on a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms-9 ) .",
    "dc magnetization were measured on a quantum design magnetic property measurement system ( mpms-5 ) .    ) for lafe@xmath0co@xmath1zn@xmath16aso samples .",
    "( b ) enlarged plots of @xmath19 versus @xmath20 around the transition temperature.,width=264 ]",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the xrd patterns of the lafe@xmath0co@xmath1zn@xmath2aso samples , and figure 1(b ) shows the variations of lattice constants with zn content .",
    "all the xrd peaks can be well indexed with the tetragonal zrcusias - type structure , indicating that all the samples are single phase without foreign phases .",
    "both the @xmath21-axis and @xmath22-axis increase slightly with the zn content , consistent with the fact that the lattice constants of laznaso are larger than those of lafeaso@xcite .",
    "these results indicate that zn has successfully substituted partial fe ions in the lattice .",
    "figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for the lafe@xmath0co@xmath1zn@xmath16aso samples .",
    "the resistivity around the sc transition is enlarged as shown in the figure 2(b ) . according to our previous study , the lafe@xmath3co@xmath1aso sample without zn doping is optimally doped electron - type superconductor@xcite .",
    "the sc transition temperature @xmath23 ( defined as the midpoint in the resistive transition ) is 13.2 k. with the presence of zn impurity , @xmath23 is suppressed quickly .",
    "meanwhile the normal state resistivity increases with zn doping , and there is an obvious upturn at low temperatures just above @xmath10 .",
    "4% substitution of fe by zn has already quenched superconductivity ( @xmath10 at least below 2 k ) .",
    "recall that superconductivity is found to be robust to the zn impurity in the optimally f - doped electron - type lafeaso system , and also in the optimally k - doped hole - type ( ba , k)fe@xmath24as@xmath24 , this result is quite surprising and suggests a crucial difference in the co - doped pnictides where the chemical doping occurs directly in the conducting feas layers .",
    "figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of d.c .",
    "magnetic susceptibility measured under @xmath25 of 10 oe . without zn doping , the 7.5% co doping makes the system into optimally - doping state with a maximum @xmath26 of 13.2 k. the sharp transition in the magnetic susceptibility below @xmath27 suggests bulk superconductivity and high homogeneity , consistent with the previous report@xcite .",
    "actually the volume fraction of superconducting magnetic shielding even exceeds 100 % for this samples .",
    "the demagnetizing factor @xmath28 has not been taken into account , thus the volume fraction could be much over - estimated .",
    "with addition of zn impurity , the transition in magnetic susceptibility moves to lower temperatures , concsistent with the resistivity data .",
    "meanwhile , the volume fraction of superconducting magnetic shielding becomes smaller .",
    "figure 4 shows temperature dependence of hall coefficient @xmath29 for lafe@xmath0co@xmath1zn@xmath2aso samples . for the optimally doped samples without zn impurity ,",
    "@xmath30 shows a sharp transition when it enter into superconducting state . there is a large negative peak just below @xmath26 , and then @xmath30 goes to zero with further deceasing temperature .",
    "such a negative peak in @xmath30 below @xmath10 is often observed in high - quality high-@xmath10 cuprates and it is ascribed to the contribution from the motion of vortices@xcite .",
    "the presence of zn impurity diminishes this peak .",
    "meanwhile , the high - temperature @xmath29 remains almost unchanged with zn doping , indicating that zn doping does not change the charge carrier density .",
    "this is consistent with the band calculation result which predicts that energy level of zn 3@xmath8 electrons are deep below the fermi level@xcite . unlike co doping",
    ", zn doping does not induce extra mobile electrons into the conducting feas layers .",
    "co@xmath1zn@xmath16aso samples measured under @xmath25 of 10 oe .",
    "the data were taken under the zero - field cooling ( zfc ) protocol.,width=264 ]    , of the lafe@xmath0co@xmath1zn@xmath16aso samples measured under @xmath25 of 50000 oe.,width=264 ]    we plot @xmath10 versus zn content ( @xmath31 ) of lafe@xmath0co@xmath1zn@xmath2aso and @xmath10 versus co content ( @xmath31 ) of lafe@xmath6co@xmath32aso in figure 5 to compare the effect of zn impurity with that of co doping .",
    "the data of @xmath10 with @xmath31 of lafe@xmath6co@xmath32aso are taken from our previous report@xcite . as we pointed out hereinbefore , the maximum @xmath10",
    "is reached at the optimally doping level @xmath31 = 0.075 for this co - doped electron - type la-1111 superconductor .",
    "when co content is greater than 0.075 , @xmath10 decreases gradually with a rate ( d@xmath33 ) of about -1.0 k per 1% of co doping due to over - doping of charge carriers .",
    "however , it is obvious that the decreasing rate of @xmath10 with @xmath17 ( zn content ) is much larger , about -3.0 k per 1% of zn impurity , implied that there is fundamentally different mechanism of zn doping .",
    "the result also supports our conclusion that the zn doping does not induce extra mobile electrons to the conducting feas layers , whereas co doping does .",
    "actually the resistivity value increases quickly with increasing zn content , and the upturn in resistivity at low temperature also becomes more obvious , implying that the zn impurity is a very effective impurity scattering center and it causes severe sc pairing breaking effect in the co - doped electron - type la-1111 systems .",
    "this finding is in sharp contrast to the previous report on the effect of zn impurity in the optimally f - doped la-1111 system where @xmath10 is robust to the zn impurity@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a severe suppression of @xmath10 by zn impurity is indeed observed in over - doped la-1111 systems @xcite . in previous study , a switch of paring state from impurity - insensitive state ( such as usual @xmath9-wave ) to impurity - sensitive state ( such as @xmath8-wave or @xmath5-wave ) has been proposed when the f doping level is increased . in the co - doped electron - type systems , the pairing state could become impurity - sensitive ( e.g. , @xmath8-wave or @xmath5-wave ) even in the optimally doped level .",
    "such a change in pairing state with different chemical doping ( especially on different lattice site ) strongly suggests that the even a very subtle change in the electronic structure could result in a different pairing state , i.e. the pairing state could be dependent on the chemical doping .",
    "this proposal is also supported by the previous reports on the measurements of sc gap .",
    "a nodal gap has been observed for the p - doped bafe@xmath24as@xmath24 system@xcite and also in over - doped kfe@xmath24as@xmath24 system@xcite while full gaps have been observed in the optimally doped bafe@xmath24as@xmath24 system@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we should also point out another possibility that the nature of co doping could be disturbed by zn impurity since both are substituted on the feas layer .",
    "furthermore studies are required to clarify the different mechanisms of chemical doping .     with zn",
    "content for the lafe@xmath0co@xmath1zn@xmath16aso system .",
    "the @xmath23 versus co content in the over - doped regime of the lafe@xmath6co@xmath32aso system is also shown for comparison . the @xmath23 data for the lafe@xmath6co@xmath7aso system are taken from ref.@xcite.,width=264 ]",
    "in summary , we find a severe suppression of superconductivity by non - magnetic zn impurity in the co - doped electron - type la 1111 system lafe@xmath0co@xmath1zn@xmath2aso .",
    "this finding is in contrast to the previous studies of zn impurity effect in optimally f - doped system , although it is consistent with the theoretic prediction on the effect of non - magnetic impurity in the scenario of @xmath5 pairing .",
    "these results on the effects of zn impurity strongly suggest that the pairing state could be different in the systems with different chemical doping .",
    "the difference in the electronic structure due to different chemical doping should be taken into account by the theoretical models .",
