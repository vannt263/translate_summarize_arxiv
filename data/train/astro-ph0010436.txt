    "self - interacting dark matter has been proposed recently to alleviate some of the problems of galaxy formation arising in the standard cold dark matter models @xcite , @xcite . by allowing for heat conduction into the cooler galactic center",
    ", the collisional dark matter model reduces the density cusp , which is predicted by numerical simulations in the cdm model @xcite , and seems to be in conflict with observations .",
    "a drawback of such a scenario is that the desired heat conduction takes place in all dark matter - dominated systems , producing undesired phenomena in some situations . in clusters of galaxies ,",
    "the hot cluster halo would tend to evaporate the relatively cooler galactic halos , giving strict limits on the allowed range of the self - interaction cross - section .",
    "depending on the value of the cross - section per particle mass , @xmath8 , collisional dark matter can act either as a fluid or as a rarefied gas .",
    "the mean free path of dark matter particles is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dark matter density . in the fluid regime , @xmath11 ,",
    "the heat diffuses out of the hot region ( cluster halo ) to the cool region ( galaxy halo ) on the conduction time scale . in the opposite optically - thin regime ,",
    "@xmath12 , the interaction is an elastic scattering of the particles .    numerical simulations in both fluid @xcite ; @xcite and scattering regimes @xcite ; @xcite have shown that in isolated halos the central cusp is indeed replaced by a soft core , as desired , for a suitable range of cross - section",
    "however , a large range of cross - section appears to be already ruled out by various observations .",
    "the experimental limits and the required rates of core evolution are estimated to narrow the currently allowed values to the range @xmath13 @xmath2 g@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "theoretical arguments seem to be most powerful for the clusters of galaxies .",
    "self - interaction tends to make clusters more spherical than follows from the lensing observations .",
    "for example , @xcite estimated that this constrains the cross - section to be @xmath14 @xmath2 g@xmath3 .",
    "however , there are serious uncertainties associated with this limit due to statistical and other issues . in this paper",
    "we consider the effect of thermal evaporation of dark matter halos in clusters .",
    "significant evaporation of dark matter halos of the elliptical galaxies would introduce a systematic offset in their fundamental plane relations , compared to the field ellipticals .    in  [ sec :",
    "fluid ] we calculate the dynamics of spherically - symmetric galaxy halos in the fluid regime solving the diffusion equation . in ",
    "[ sec : scat ] we estimate the evaporation time analytically in the scattering regime . in ",
    "[ sec : tempdep ] we consider the case of a temperature - dependent cross - section that changes the dynamics of the inner parts of the halo .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : ell ] we show that the evaporation of dark matter halos is probably inconsistent with observational scatter of the fundamental plane relation .",
    "in the fluid regime ( @xmath15 ) , the frequent interactions of dark matter particles can be described by a diffusion equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the entropy , @xmath18 is the number density of dark matter particles of mass @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the temperature defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the one - dimensional thermal velocity of dark matter particles .",
    "the coefficient of thermal conductivity for the monatomic gas is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the specific heat per particle . from theoretical arguments",
    "@xcite , the cross - section is either constant or inversely proportional to temperature squared : @xmath25 , @xmath26 or 2 .",
    "also , wyithe , turner & spergel ( 2000 ) have recently proposed an intermediate case , @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath28 the entropy @xmath17 relates to the equation of state @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath31 assuming that heat conduction is slow compared to the dynamical time in the galaxy , equation ( [ eq : diff ] ) needs to be solved simultaneously with the hydrostatic equilibrium equation .",
    "appendix [ sec : scheme ] contains the detailed implementation of the code .    as an example , we choose an unspectacular elliptical galaxy ngc 4869 in the coma cluster , situated at a distance of @xmath32 from the cluster center ( 220 kpc for the adopted hubble constant @xmath33 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) .",
    "its effective radius is @xmath34 kpc and the half - light luminosity in v band is @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio within @xmath36 , according to the fundamental plane relation for such a galaxy , is 8 in solar units @xcite .",
    "this is about twice the ratio expected for an old stellar population @xcite ( later we discuss that the most likely fraction of dark matter mass within @xmath36 is approximately 50% ) , and it is consistent with the observed stellar velocity dispersion 200 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we conservatively take the total mass of the dark matter halo to be twice the mass contained within the half - light radius ; @xmath37 .    to set the initial profile for the halo we choose the hernquist model extending to the tidal radius @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the concentration parameter .",
    "we consider three values of the core radius of the galactic halo , @xmath41 kpc .",
    "the concentration of the halo may affect its ( thermo)dynamical evolution .",
    "the core radius of about 5 kpc is expected for a galaxy of such luminosity from the relation of @xcite .",
    "the density profile of the coma cluster consistent with x - ray data @xcite is @xmath42 with @xmath43 g @xmath44 pc@xmath45 and @xmath46 kpc .",
    "the average cluster density at the position of ngc 4869 is @xmath47 pc@xmath45 .",
    "this tidal density determines the truncation radius of the galactic halo , @xmath38 , via @xmath48 and gives @xmath49 kpc .",
    "the initial profile for the integration is a sum of the halo and cluster distributions . to account for the off - center position of the halo in the cluster",
    ", we have reduced the central density of the cluster profile to the value of the tidal density , @xmath50 .",
    "this is justified as the galaxy size is much smaller than the core radius of the cluster and this provides a correct tidal truncation .",
    "also , as the galaxy orbits around the cluster center , its tidal radius and other external boundary conditions may vary . using the observed position in the cluster as the average value is reasonable since",
    "the galaxies are expected to be observed at the location where they spend most of their time .",
    "dimensionless equations can be obtained using the characteristic mass @xmath51 and size @xmath52 of the galaxy halo .",
    "the unit of temperature is then @xmath53 , the unit of velocity is @xmath54 , and the unit of time @xmath55 where @xmath56 yr is the dynamical time and @xmath57 is the optical depth at the tidal radius .",
    "figure [ fig : cl_den ] shows the evolution of the galaxy and cluster halos for the case of constant cross - section , @xmath58 .",
    "the initial stage , @xmath59 , is driven by internal relaxation in the center but the subsequent evolution is accelerated by the heat transfer from the outside . the rate of evolution in the cluster is faster than in isolation . as a result of heating , the galactic halo expands and the tidal radius shrinks .",
    "eventually , at @xmath60 the whole halo evaporates leaving the smooth cluster density profile .",
    "however , the evolution of the temperature profile is not monotonic in time ( figure [ fig : cl_temp ] ) .",
    "first , the central temperature rises as the heat is conducted inward from the neighboring regions . at the same time , the tidal boundary between the relatively hot and cold regions moves inward , the halo expands , the confining pressure drops , and as a result the temperature decreases between 1 and 10 kpc .",
    "then , at @xmath61 the central temperature begins to fall as the whole galaxy becomes isothermal . at @xmath62",
    "the central temperature reaches its minimum , even below the initial value . at that point",
    "the central density is already 100 times lower than initially .",
    "then , the remains of the galaxy halo quickly evaporate , and at @xmath60 its density falls by another two orders of magnitude , while the temperature jumps by two orders of magnitude to match the cluster profile .",
    "varying the concentration of the galaxy halo does not change its evolution qualitatively .",
    "a lower density model ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 kpc , same @xmath38 ) disrupts in @xmath65 , while the higher density model ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 kpc ) takes about @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the evaporation time is weakly dependent on the internal structure of the halo , and the best value can be taken as @xmath69 .",
    "the evolution is identical in dimensionless units as long as the galactic halo is in the fluid regime .",
    "the dark matter cross - section enters only the unit of time , @xmath70 .",
    "the larger the cross - section the shorter is the mean free path and the longer is the evaporation timescale , @xmath71    the stars in the galaxy increase the lifetime of the dark halo by providing an additional gravitational attraction in the inner parts . equation ( [ eq : tfl ] ) shows that @xmath72 depends essentially on the average velocity dispersion of the halo . adding the fraction of stellar mass , @xmath73 , would therefore increase the evaporation time by about 20% .",
    "note , that in the fluid regime the density of the cluster particles does not affect the halo evaporation timescale , as long as the cluster represents a much larger heat reservoir .",
    "the inward propagation of the heat wave is governed primarily by the temperature gradient between the galaxy and the cluster .",
    "if that gradient is always large , the evaporation time is determined by the internal conduction time and is insensitive to the cluster parameters .",
    "the situation is different when the particle mean free path is larger than @xmath74 : in this case the fluid equation ( [ eq : diff ] ) does not apply .",
    "the critical density of the fluid regime , i.e. the average density for which the optical depth is unity , is @xmath75 for @xmath76 @xmath2 g@xmath3 , the galactic and cluster halo densities fall below the critical density .",
    "if the cross - section is considerably smaller , the evolution in the optically - thin regime can be calculated at three levels of approximation .",
    "\\(i ) cluster particles , which have much higher kinetic energy , would impart a fraction of this energy to the relatively cooler galactic particles with each collision .",
    "for the same particle mass , the energy exchange would suffice to unbind the galactic particle .",
    "thus , each collision with the cluster particle removes one from the halo .",
    "the mean free path of the cluster particles through the galactic halo is @xmath77 , and the probability of collision in one crossing time is @xmath78 . in the optically - thin limit",
    ", the collision time per particle at the tidal radius @xmath79 is then @xmath80 where the crossing time of the cluster particles is @xmath81 .",
    "the collision time for all galactic particles is @xmath82 .",
    "but since the densities of the galaxy and the cluster are similar at the tidal radius , the timescale is of the same order .",
    "\\(ii ) the calculation can be done more accurately , noting that at any position within the halo the rate of evaporation is @xmath83 .",
    "the amount of bound mass decreases faster because the tidal boundary shrinks as mass is being lost .",
    "the resulting mass loss is exponential with the timescale roughly @xmath84 , depending on the steepness of the density profile . with sufficient accuracy",
    "we can still take the evaporation time to be @xmath85 .",
    "\\(iii ) finally , a heat transfer equation can be used , similar to equation ( [ eq : diff ] ) , treating the galaxy and cluster particles as two separate fluids . in this case",
    "the diffusion coefficient has to be modified to account for the large mean free path of the particles .",
    "the details are described in appendix [ sec : opthin ] . in the scattering regime ,",
    "the smaller the cross - section the longer is the evolution timescale . at the position of ngc 4869 the cluster density is @xmath86 pc@xmath45 and @xmath87 km s@xmath3",
    "this gives for the evaporation time @xmath88    figure [ fig : cross ] shows the evaporation time in the fluid and optically - thin regimes .",
    "the fastest evolution is achieved for the marginal case @xmath89 , in which domain we have not made a calculation .",
    "this intermediate region is sketched in with the dashed line . there",
    ", the estimates of the evaporation time should agree in the two regimes .",
    "for the chosen tidal density , the critical value of the cross - section is @xmath90 @xmath2 g@xmath3 .",
    "the two time scales , @xmath91 yr and @xmath92 yr , agree to within a factor of two .",
    "another effect can be important in the fluid regime ( pointed out by the referee , andi burkert ) .",
    "ram pressure of the cluster halo strips outer parts of the galactic halo as the latter moves around the cluster .",
    "the restoring gravitational force of the stars balances the ram pressure force on dark matter particles only at two half - light radii of ngc 4869 . at the tidal radius",
    "the gravitational force falls to 5% of that .",
    "thus , we expect that on a dynamical timescale the material outside about @xmath93 kpc from the galactic center would be stripped .",
    "this would only accelerate heat conduction to the inner region and accelerate evaporation of the halo .    in the optically - thin regime ,",
    "ram pressure is equivalent to the direct scattering of particles and does not add to a new effect .",
    "the orbital motion of the halo contributes to the relative velocity between the cluster and galactic particles , which is of the same order .",
    "thus , the constraint on the cross - section can be strengthened by a factor @xmath94 ( cf eq . [ [ eq : tsc ] ] ) .",
    "dynamical friction of the galactic orbit in the cluster would also speed up evaporation in either regime . as the halo gradually spirals in towards the cluster center",
    ", it encounters a higher density of cluster particles with higher temperature .",
    "however , we ignore this effect as it is unlikely to change the constraint on the interaction cross - section significantly .",
    "elliptical galaxies satisfy a tight fundamental plane relation @xcite .",
    "one of its projections , the faber - jackson relation , has an observed scatter in the central velocity dispersion @xmath95 both in optical bands and in the near - infrared @xcite .",
    "if the ellipticals lose their dark matter halos , their stellar distributions would adiabatically expand and reduce the central dispersion , while conserving the total luminosity .",
    "this would introduce a systematic offset in the faber - jackson relation , compared to the field ellipticals that have not lost their dark matter halos .",
    "the adiabatic expansion is characterized by conservation of the azimuthal action , @xmath96 .",
    "a spherical shell initially at radius @xmath74 would adiabatically expand to the radius @xmath97 such that @xmath98 \\",
    ", r.\\ ] ] the amount of expansion depends on the fraction of dark matter within @xmath74 : @xmath99 .",
    "the surface brightness of elliptical galaxies is well fitted by the de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "the effective radius , @xmath36 , characterizes the core of the stellar distribution and contains half the luminous mass , @xmath100 . as a result of adiabatic expansion of the core , the effective radius would rise by a factor @xmath101    as the core expands , the stellar velocity dispersion falls .",
    "if the dispersion profile is flat in the core , i.e. @xmath102 is determined by the mass distribution within @xmath36 , the dispersion would drop by @xmath103 . then",
    ", the galaxy would still satisfy the faber - jackson relation within the errors if the dark matter fraction is @xmath104 .",
    "spectroscopic observations of elliptical galaxies usually have apertures of approximately 3 , corresponding to 1.5 kpc at the distance of the coma cluster .",
    "the aperture size may be small enough compared to @xmath36 so that it contains only a small fraction of dark matter , and the measured dispersion would respond more weakly to the expansion of the core . as an alternate limiting case , we consider that @xmath102 may not change at all , even though the surface brightness does decrease within @xmath36 .",
    "in addition to the change of the faber - jackson relation , expansion of the stellar core would lead to a shift away from the fundamental plane relation .",
    "the latter can be expressed as the variation with mass of the mass - to - light ratio within @xmath36 : @xmath105 @xcite , where the mass is defined as @xmath106 .",
    "the expansion of the core would change the measured value of @xmath107 while the integrated luminosity @xmath108 remains the same .",
    "figure [ fig : fp ] demonstrates the effect for ngc 4869 . if the core velocity dispersion falls as the effective radius expands , @xmath109 , both the mass and the mass - to - light ratio decrease by the factor @xmath110 ( eq . [ [ eq : rere ] ] ) .",
    "if the velocity dispersion does not respond to the core variation at all , both variables increase by the same amount , and the galaxy again moves away from the fundamental plane .",
    "the magnitude of the offset is determined by the dark matter fraction @xmath111 .",
    "the amount of dark matter in elliptical galaxies is harder to measure than in spiral galaxies .",
    "fitting results of the x - ray profiles of 42 bright elliptical galaxies @xcite require @xmath112 to explain the spectral parameter @xmath113 .",
    "the best fitting model with @xmath114 has @xmath115 .",
    "this estimate , that dark matter contributes 50% of the total mass of an elliptical galaxy at the half - light radius , is consistent with our model of ngc 4869 , and also with the model of ngc 4472 obtained using the velocity dispersion of globular clusters @xcite .",
    "we use the value @xmath116 in figure [ fig : fp ] .    if the dark matter fraction @xmath117 , elliptical galaxies in clusters need to retain their dark matter halos in order to stay on the same fundamental plane as the field ellipticals .",
    "the fundamental plane relation is observed to be the same in clusters and in the field , and within clusters there is no differential radial effect .",
    "the evaporation time of the halos , in either fluid or scattering regime , must be longer than the hubble time .",
    "figure [ fig : cross ] shows that this excludes the range of the collisional cross - section @xmath118 @xmath2 g@xmath3 .",
    "note , that similar constraints apply to other types of galaxy .",
    "the evaporation of dark matter halos of spiral galaxies in clusters would introduce a systematic offset in the tully - fisher relation .",
    "in addition , bulges of spiral galaxies are observed to lie on the same fundamental plane as elliptical galaxies .",
    "expansion of the cores of elliptical galaxies in clusters would break this law .",
    "the evaporation and heat conduction are modified if the self - interaction cross - section varies with the relative velocity of dark matter particles . if self - interaction is coupling - limited + @xcite , the cross - section decreases with temperature as @xmath119 . the expected temperature scale for likely candidate particles @xmath120 kev .",
    "other forms of interaction are conceivable and therefore we consider a general function for the cross - section varying as @xmath25 . obviously , only the product @xmath121 can be constrained .",
    "note that different temperatures determine the cross - section depending on the optical depth . if @xmath122 , it is the local temperature of the colder halo ; if @xmath123 , it is the temperature of the hotter halo , since it contributes mainly to the relative particle velocity .",
    "the optical depth itself depends on the temperature , but at the tidal radius the two regimes coincide as @xmath124 for @xmath122 .",
    "the most optimistic values of the cross - section , as not being in contradiction with observations described in the previous section , lie in the optically - thin regime with @xmath125 @xmath2 g@xmath3 .",
    "since we have the freedom in choosing @xmath126 , we fix the temperature scale at @xmath127 km s@xmath3 . in this case",
    "the evaporation time in the optically - thin regime remains the same : @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 correspond to the hotter halo .",
    "the optical depth at the tidal radius is also constant regardless of @xmath131 ; @xmath132 . throughout this section",
    ", the cross - section @xmath133 refers to the particular choice of @xmath134 .    in the fluid regime ,",
    "the diffusion equation is different with @xmath135 ( see eq . [ [ eq : fluid ] ] ) .",
    "compared with the constant cross - section case , heat conduction is suppressed in the cooler central parts of the galaxy while the heat wave from the cluster propagates faster in the outer parts .",
    "thus , for @xmath136 , the desired central heating is reduced , but the unwanted evaporation of the outer region is increased .",
    "this requires modification of the external boundary condition in the numerical code .",
    "the simplest solution is to neglect the scattering events in the cluster halo and move the external boundary to the galactic tidal radius .",
    "thus , the galaxy is bound by a fixed cluster pressure at @xmath79 .",
    "the evolution proceeds similarly to the case described in  [ sec : fluid ] , but somewhat faster in the outer parts .",
    "the evaporation time is @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is decreasing with increasing @xmath131 ; @xmath139 .",
    "however , the unit of time @xmath140 is scaled up with @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the evaporation time in the fluid regime is @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the unit of velocity of the colder halo . for @xmath143 and @xmath144 km s@xmath3 , appropriate for ngc 4869 , @xmath145 yr . the fluid regime applies to ngc 4869 for @xmath146 @xmath2 g@xmath3 .",
    "even if we take @xmath147 @xmath2 g@xmath3 , so that the optical depth is very low at the tidal radius of ngc 4869 , the central part may become optically - thick if @xmath136 .",
    "because of the lower velocity dispersion , the cross - section would rise steeply there .",
    "for example , for @xmath148 , the inner 8 kpc are optically - thick . because of the negative heat capacity of the self - gravitating central region , heat transfer into the center would only lower the temperature and increase the cross - section .",
    "a natural lower limit of the temperature is the velocity dispersion provided by the stars , of order 200 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the central density of dark matter would fall until the optical depth falls below unity .",
    "if we require that the dark matter mass within @xmath149 does not fall by more than 50% , the cross - section must not decrease with temperature faster than @xmath150 .",
    "note that for @xmath136 the optical depth increases for smaller halos , by a factor @xmath151 ( cf eq .",
    "[ [ eq : tau ] ] ) . in the optically - thin regime , the cross - section increases by the same factor .",
    "therefore , the halos of dwarf galaxies would evolve faster within the local group ( @xmath152 km s@xmath3 ) than within large clusters ( @xmath153 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "for example , carina , draco , and ursa minor are entirely dark - matter dominated dwarf galaxies , with the central velocity dispersion @xmath154 km s@xmath3 @xcite . if the dark matter particles in their halos become optically - thick to self - interaction the cross - section grows even further , by a factor @xmath155 compared to the @xmath58 case . for the large or small enough values of @xmath131 , depending on the regime",
    ", the dwarf halos would completely evaporate .",
    "this allows us to constrain a possible range of @xmath131 from the requirement that the dwarf halos survive for the hubble time .",
    "the density of the galaxy halo at a distance of 70 - 100 kpc , where the dwarf spheroidals are located , is of order @xmath156 .",
    "the estimated masses of the dwarf halos are @xmath157 , and the corresponding tidal radii @xmath158 kpc .",
    "we shall fix the normalization of the cross - section at @xmath147 @xmath2 g@xmath3 , suitable for large galaxies .",
    "then , the dwarf halos would satisfy the condition @xmath159 as long as @xmath160 .",
    "in fact , in the cores of these galaxies the density is much higher than average , @xmath161 within the core radii @xmath162 pc @xcite . in order for the centers to remain in the optically - thin regime ,",
    "the halos need @xmath163 . from equation ( [ eq : tsc2 ] )",
    ", the evaporation time is longer than @xmath164 yr if @xmath165 .",
    "thus , in the scattering regime @xmath131 should be small enough to rescue the dwarfs .",
    "if the slope @xmath131 is high enough ( @xmath166 ) , the dwarf galaxies may fall into the optically - thick regime even for @xmath147 @xmath2 g@xmath3 . from equation ( [ eq : tfl2 ] ) , the evaporation time is longer than @xmath164 yr if @xmath7 ( or @xmath167 for @xmath168 @xmath2 g@xmath3 ) . in other words ,",
    "the cross - section should increase substantially enough that heat conduction slows down .",
    "thus , the presence of the dark matter - dominated dwarf galaxies in the local group rules out a certain range of the temperature slope , @xmath169 , even for the most optimistic value of @xmath170 @xmath2 g@xmath3 .",
    "together with the constraint from ngc 4869 , this excludes the values @xmath171 .",
    "we have considered astrophysical constraints on the possible cross - section of self - interacting dark matter .",
    "the fundamental plane relation of elliptical galaxies requires that their dark halos largely survive the heating from the hot cluster halos .",
    "this condition applies to galaxies with the half - light dark matter fraction @xmath172 . for a velocity - independent cross - section ,",
    "the evaporation time of such halos is shorter than the hubble time if @xmath173 @xmath2 g@xmath3 .",
    "the parameter space can be enlarged by assuming @xmath147 @xmath2 g@xmath3 and allowing for a velocity dependence of the cross - section .",
    "the large halos would be unaffected , as long as they remain in the optically - thin regime , but the dwarf halos within larger halos would evaporate if the optical depth rises towards unity .",
    "the presence of dwarf spheroidals in the local group excludes the range of the power - law slope @xmath171 .",
    "combined with other constraints in the literature @xcite , this appears to exclude the most interesting range of the cross - section for the purpose of lowering the core densities of galactic halos . in order to reduce the central density cusp by scattering ,",
    "the optical depth at the scale radius of the halo @xmath174 should be close to unity @xcite . for a hernquist model of the halo",
    ", @xmath175 exceeds the optical depth at the tidal radius , @xmath176 , by a factor @xmath177 .",
    "we can therefore expect the optimum regime to be @xmath178 , but as figure [ fig : cross ] demonstrates , this regime would lead to evaporation of the halo in less than a hubble time .",
    "thus , the original motivation for considering self - interacting dark matter may require collisional cross - sections too large to be consistent with observations of galaxies in clusters .",
