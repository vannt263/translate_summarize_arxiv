    "moreover , according to the @xmath0 collaboration @xcite , the preferred @xmath12 assignments are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "+   + since the observation of the two resonant structures , many explanations have been proposed for the @xmath0 pentaquark states .",
    "meson - baryon molecules were suggested in @xcite .",
    "pentaquark states of diquark - diquark - antiquark nature were suggested in @xcite , and @xmath15 soliton states in @xcite . + the molecular interpretation works well for the heaviest resonant state ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in this study , we focus on the lightest pentaquark structure ( with @xmath1 ) , by means of a multiquark approach .    from the @xmath0 quantum numbers of the lightest resonant state ,",
    "we show that it can be described as a pentaquark state with spin @xmath16 .",
    "we show that the ground state multiplet of the charmonium pentaquark states is a @xmath17 octet , and we studied all the charmonium pentaquark states which belong to the octet , predicted their masses , and suggested possible decay channels in which the experimentalists can observe them . by using an effective lagrangian @xcite for the @xmath18 coupling , in combination with the branching ratio @xmath19 upper limit extracted by wang @xcite , and with our predicted masses , we compute the partial decay widths for the predicted pentaquark resonances .",
    "in order to classify the pentaquark multiplets , we made use , as much as possible , of symmetry principles , without introducing any explicit dynamical models .",
    "we made use of the young tableaux technique , adopting for each representation the notation @xmath20_d=[f_1,\\ldots , f_n]_d$ ] , where @xmath21 denotes the number of boxes in the @xmath22-th row of the young tableau , and @xmath23 is the dimension of the representation .",
    "+   + in agreement with the @xmath0 hypothesis @xcite , we think the charmonium pentaquark wave function as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a light quark and @xmath26 is the heavy charm quark .",
    "let us first discuss the possible configurations of @xmath27 quarks in the @xmath24 system .",
    "+   + the @xmath28 can be in a colour octet or singlet with spin 0 or 1 .",
    "the colour wave function of the @xmath24 system must be an @xmath29 singlet , so the remaining three light quarks are also in a color - singlet or in a color - octet .",
    "+ the orbital symmetry of the quark wave function depends on the quantum numbers of the resonant state @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the parity @xmath30 of the pentaquark system is : @xmath31 and so @xmath32 must be even .",
    "the total angular momentum is @xmath33 , and so @xmath34 or @xmath35 . in this paper , we hypothesise that the lightest charmonium pentaquark state reported by the @xmath0 collaboration is a ground state pentaquark with @xmath34 , and so each quark is in @xmath36-wave .",
    "+ the three light quarks must satisfy the pauli principle . as a consequence , since the @xmath37 orbital part is completely symmetric , the spin - flavour and the colour part are conjugate : spin - flavour symmetric state if they are in a colour singlet ; or spin - flavour mixed symmetry state if they are in a colour octet . therefore , the allowed @xmath38 spin - flavour pentaquark configurations are a 56-plet ( @xmath39_{56}$ ] ) and a 70-plet ( @xmath40_{70}$ ] ) which correspond respectively to the three light quarks in a colour singlet and in a colour octet . in tab .",

    "the significance of each of these states is more than 9 standard deviations .",
    "the lightest one has a mass of @xmath44 and a width of @xmath45 , while the heaviest has a mass of @xmath46 and a width of @xmath47 .",

    "+ the earliest prediction for the charmonium pentaquark with @xmath48 was given by j. j. wu et al .",
    "the heaviest pentaquark state has been apparently well explained by means of a molecular approach @xcite , and it was also predicted in a molecular approach before the @xmath0 discovery by @xcite , in a coupled - channel unitary approach . + as regards the lightest one , molecular models have also been proposed , but the predictions are not so good as for the heaviest state @xcite",
    ". some predictions of its mass and quantum numbers were given by @xcite in 2012 , by means of a potential quark model approach , but these predictions depend strongly on the particular interaction used : colour - magnetic interaction ( cm ) based on one - gluon exchange , chiral interaction ( fs ) based on meson exchange , and instanton - induced interaction ( inst . ) based on the non - perturbative qcd vacuum structure .",
    "+ in this present study , we focused on describing the lightest resonant state ( @xmath49 ) , by means of a multiquark approach .",
    "an extension of the original gr mass formula @xcite which correctly describes the charmed baryon sector was performed ( tab .",
    "[ bar mass prediction ] ) , and also proved able to give an unexpected prediction for the mass of the lightest pentaquark state @xmath50 , which is in agreement with the experimental value within one standard deviation .",

    "the theoretical mass of the lightest pentaquark state @xmath50 predicted by means of the gr formula extension ( eq . [ gr ] ) is @xmath51 , in agreement with the experimental mass @xmath52 .",

    "we have finally computed the partial decay widths for all the suggested octet - pentaquark decay channels .",
    "+ as the @xmath53 decay is expected to be dominated by @xmath54 resonances @xcite , we observe that the poor knowledge about the @xmath55 excited states can affect the estimation of the parameters of the two pentaquark resonances .",
    "moreover , as was noticed by wang  @xcite , if the two pentaquark candidates are genuine states , their production in photoproduction should be a natural expectation .",
    "for these reasons , on the one hand it is important to increase our knowledge about the missing excited states @xmath55 with new experiments ( @xcite ) , in order to improve the analysis and to extract with more precision the two pentaquark masses and widths . on the other hand",
    ", a refined measurement of the @xmath56 photoproduction cross section would provide more information about the nature of the pentaquark states .",
