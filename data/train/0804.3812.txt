    "[ sec : intr ] in addition to the obvious magellanic clouds and the tidally disrupting sagittarius dwarf ( ibata , gilmore & irwin 1994 ) , the milky way ( mw ) has 8 relatively nearby dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies for which the radial velocities of many hundreds of member stars have been meticulously measured at various projected radii allowing the calculation of the line of sight ( los ) velocity dispersion as a function of projected radius .",
    "if we assume the satellites are spherical and in equilibrium , we can use specific mass models to check the consistency of the luminous matter in replicating the los dispersion profiles through the jeans equation .",
    "it so happens that these small satellites appear to be some of the most heavily cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated systems in the universe and so including only the luminous matter in jeans analysis underestimates the los velocity dispersions considerably .",
    "it is because of the well studied , small spacial scales and large dark matter content that gilmore et al .",
    "( 2007ab ) have used the relatively low dark matter density in the cores of dwarf spheroidals to argue for an upper limit on the mass of the dm particles from supersymmetric theories",
    ".    there has been speculation that ursa minor and draco are formed from the tidal debris of the magellanic stream ( lynden - bell 1983 ; metz & kroupa 2007 ) and that leo i , leo ii and sculptor have similarly formed from debris cast by the tidal break - up of a previously larger fornax satellite .",
    "more likely , the dwarfs were part of two small groups of galaxies that have entered the milky way at late times .",
    "dwarf galaxies often form from the debris of tidally disrupted progenitor galaxies . in this case , very little cdm accompanies the stars and gas for the simple reason that the tidal disruption must have torn the gas and the cdm out into streams from which the gas has condensed and formed stars and only a limited amount of cdm can have condensed with it .",
    "this is contrary to the standard picture where gas cools and falls onto an already formed cdm halo .",
    "there has been a recent study by bournaud et al .",
    "( 2007 ) of tidal dwarf galaxies formed from the debris of ngc5291 . they found a persisting mass discrepancy by measuring the visible galactic masses and comparing with the mass implied by the rotation curves .",
    "they proposed the existence of hitherto unheard of disk dm , in the progenitor galaxies , in the form of molecular gas ( as opposed to the cold dm of massive particle form ) .",
    "two simultaneous studies ( milgrom 2007 and gentile et al . 2007 ) in the framework of milgrom ( 1983 ) s modified newtonian dynamics ( mond : for reviews see sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ; bekenstein 2006 ; milgrom 2008 ) found the discrepancy was exactly that expected in mond because the tidal dwarfs are very diffuse and low surface brightness ( mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ) meaning they have low internal accelerations ( much less than the transition acceleration of the theory @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the external accelerations from the large progenitors is also weak ( discussed in depth in both papers ) allowing a relatively large boost to the internal gravity enabling perfect agreement with the observed rotation curve using just the luminous matter ( no need for cdm or molecular disk dm ) .",
    "this is the most remarkable evidence for mond since the baryonic tully - fisher relation was matched in great detail ( mcgaugh et al .",
    "2000 ; mcgaugh 2005 ) .",
    "previous attempts to check the consistency of the milky way s dwarfs with mond have been limited to single number central velocity dispersions ( although see lokas et al .",
    "2001 which sadly does not include the external field effect ) .",
    "this gave good estimates of the mass - to - light ratios ( m / l ) for all the dwarfs studied here by considering whether each dwarf was dominated gravitationally by the external field of the milky way ( mw ) or by its own internal gravity ( see milgrom 1995 , brada & milgrom 2000 ) .",
    "if it was dominated by the external gravity , @xmath3 then the newtonian m / l was used after renormalisation of newton s constant , @xmath4 , reducing the m / l in mond by the same factor . if the external gravity was weak w.r.t .",
    "the internal gravity then the dwarf mass was calculated from the relation @xmath5 from which the m / l can be deduced . nevertheless , proper jeans modelling with the luminosity profile of the dwarf along with the near exact calculation of the dwarf s internal gravity at all radii by including analysis of the external field effect ( see milgrom 1983 , angus & mcgaugh 2008ab and wu et al . 2007 ) and variation of the velocity anisotropy profile ( angus et al .",
    "2008 ) in order to match the observed los dispersions at all radii is far more satisfactory .",
    "this also gives tighter limits on the m / l .",
    "the key data for the analysis are the luminosity of the dwarf , its structural profile and the galactocentric distance .",
    "the total luminosities , @xmath6 have been measured only in the v - band and some , especially that of sextans , are very old and we suggest that new k - band images would be more appropriate measures of the stellar mass ( driver et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "next we use the king models ( concentration c and tidal radius @xmath7 ) for the enclosed luminosity profiles , @xmath8 , of the dwarfs ( mostly taken from irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ) that allows us to numerically calculate the luminosity density as a function of radius . finally , we need the current galactocentric radius , @xmath9 in order to compute the external gravity from the mw via the flat rotation curve ( see angus & mcgaugh 2008b ) @xmath10 where the amplitude of the rotation curve is from the sdss data compiled by xue et al .",
    "from this we solve for the internal gravity [ eqn : mond ] g(r ) ( |g(r)+g_ex|/a_o)=g(m / l)l_k(r)r^-2 where we use the @xmath11 function employed by famaey & binney ( 2005 ) in their fit to the mw s terminal velocity curve [ eqn : mu ] ( x)=x/(1+x ) , and we take @xmath12 which only matters in the small transition region . then we numerically differentiate the luminosity profile from the king model , @xmath8 , to match with the simple function [ eqn : lum ] l(r ) ( 1+r r_)^-_o which is a luminosity density profile and helps us to analytically define @xmath13 for solving jeans equation for the radial velocity dispersions , @xmath14 , [ eqn : jeans ] d dr_r^2(r ) + ( r)+2(r ) r_r^2(r ) = -g(r ) and we can cast this into the los with the use of the luminosity density profile , @xmath15 ( see binney & mamon 1982 ) as per angus et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . taking an anisotropy , @xmath16 of the form [ eqn : beta ] ( r)=_o - r r_. this and all other fit parameters",
    "are given in table 1 .",
    "here we have three free parameters available for matching the observed and model velocity dispersions .",
    "they are the m / l and the two associated with @xmath16 .",
    "m / l adjusts the normalisation , whereas @xmath16 varies the shape of the los profile . note that although there are two parameters for the anisotropy , the profile required is virtually the same for 6/8 dwarfs ( see fig 2 ) . in any case , koch et al .",
    "( 2007 ) make it clear from their analysis of leo ii that there is compelling evidence for velocity anisotropy in dwarfs .    by @xmath17",
    "fitting the los velocity dispersions of mateo , olszewski & walker ( 2007 ) for leo i , muoz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for ursa minor and walker et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for the remaining 6 , with the model mond dispersions , we were able to best fit the anisotropy profile of all 8 dwarfs and thereby compute the m / l .",
    "the fits are not hugely sensitive to the anisotropy profile . for instance , in table 1 the column of @xmath18 also gives the 1-@xmath19 errors on that parameter ( found by simply holding m / l and @xmath20 constant and varying .",
    "most dwarfs have very little sensitivity to the rate at which the anisotropy decreases with radius , with the only exception being draco .",
    "many of the dwarfs ( leo i , leo ii , umi and sextans ) are quite comfortable with constant anistropies , however , none of the dwarfs are consistent with an anisotropy that becomes highly biased towards tangential orbits in small increases of radius .",
    "it is difficult to be quantitative about how we could rule out mond with any of these velocity anisotropies , since we use a very simple model for this and anisotropy could vary in a non - linear way , or there could be distinct stellar populations with completely different anisotropies .",
    "however , if instead of becoming biased towards tangential orbits at large radius , they were in reality biased towards highly radial orbits , there would be a serious problem because no m / l without a dark halo could fit the shape of the profiles .",
    "an example of this is given for the sculptor dwarf in fig [ fig : sculptor ] where the red line shows the fit with a constant @xmath21 .",
    "no scaling with m / l can produce a good fit and it shows how precise knowledge of the velocity anisotropy would be extremely constraining to mond , whereas any cdm halo can never be constrained to such detail and thus can never be falsified .",

    "the new proper motions of the magellanic clouds ( kallivayalil et al .",
    "2006ab ) show conclusively that the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) binary are currently at pericentre ( besla et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter b07 ) in their orbit of the mw . the creation of the magellanic stream , a highly collimated gas cloud arcing @xmath22 across the sky and emanating from the cloud s position .",
    "several puzzling features plague the stream such as the fact the stream does not trace the orbit of the lmc in any favourable cdm ( b07 , fig .",
    "9 ) or mond orbit ( see x.f .",
    "wu et al . in prep ) , there are very few stars in the cloud ( b07 ) and at a pericentre of @xmath23 the stream can not be tidally induced .",
    "eyeballing fig .",
    "18 of b07 one can see the motion of the smc is significantly influenced by the lmc allowing its orbit to trace the stream . as to how the gas was stripped from the smc ,",
    "we need only consider the ram pressure of the gas in the lmc .",
    "as mentioned above , on close approach to the lmc , the smc s internal gravity is damped by both by the mw and more importantly , by the lmc .    the criteria for ram pressure stripping ( roediger & bruggen 2007 ) is for the gravitational restoring force per unit area , [ eqn : fpa ] f_grav(r)=_g",
    ", smc(r)g_z(r ) , to be less than the ram pressure [ eqn : ram ] p_ram=_g , lmc v_rel^2 .",
    "where @xmath24 is the surface density of gas in the smc , @xmath25 is the smc s gravity in the direction of the collision , @xmath26 is the density of gas in the lmc and @xmath27 is the relative velocity between the lmc and smc at collision .",
    "the relative velocity between the pair at the moment is around @xmath28 .",
    "the total gas mass of the lmc is @xmath29 , so if it has dimensions ( r , z)=(8.5kpc , @xmath300.2kpc ) then the average density of gas is @xmath31 .",
    "the mass of gas in the smc is @xmath32 ( stanimirovi , staveley - smith and jones 2004)so for a typical radius of 2.5kpc , the surface density of gas is @xmath33 .",
    "the key input to this equality and the only variable that changes from mond to newtonian dynamics is the gravity of the smc in the direction of the collision .",
    "the total baryonic mass of the smc is around @xmath34 ( stanimirovi et al .",
    "2004 ) . with the lmc so close to it , the smc s internal gravity",
    "is simply newtonian with a renormalised gravitational constant , @xmath35 . at 3.5kpc ,",
    "the rotation curve of the lmc is flat ( piatek , pryor and olszewski 2007 ) at 120@xmath36 . at this radius , @xmath37 .",
    "this means that @xmath38 , whereas if the lmc was not there , and ( more or less ) compared to newtonian gravity , @xmath39 .    with these special case parameters ,",
    "the gravity must be @xmath40 to retain the gas , whereas the gravity is less than this : @xmath41 and the newtonian value is 3 - 4 times larger .",
    "this shows that ram pressure stripping in mond is easier which is completely contrary to the naive assumption ignoring the external field effect",
    ". this can easily be the mechanism which removes the gas from the smc and creates the magellanic stream .",
    "this has further implications for the ram pressure stripping of normal spirals in clusters and other satellite galaxies of the mw .",
    "here i have studied the los velocity dispersion profiles of 8 of the mw s dwarf satellites in mond .",
    "we have shown that 6 of the dwarfs ( leo i , leo ii , fornax , sculptor , ursa minor and carina ) have acceptable",
    "m / l within their errors . despite carina and ursa minor having m / ls of @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "respectively , it is pointless to be too concerned about them because they have m / l of 3 within 1-@xmath19 and uncertainties in luminosity , ellipticity , structure and equilibrium could easily account for this discrepancy .",
    "on the other hand , the remaining 2 ( draco and sextans ) have m / l completely inconsistent with the stellar populations .",
    "the possible causes of this have been discussed in depth and 3 testable effects that cause the discrepancies have been suggested .",
    "first of all , the photometry of sextans is extremely old ( more than 10 years ) and so i suggest k - band images of the dwarf should be acquired to alleviate any doubts on the luminosity of the dwarf and how the light is distributed",
    ". however , this is likely to leave sextans with a m / l similar to carina , umi and sextans ( @xmath44 ) . to be certain of the effects of non - adiabatic tidal heating of the dwarfs",
    ", we need accurate proper motions to make sure sextans is currently not at pericentre and that draco is on a highly elongated orbit plunging towards the mw .    if this is the case , then realistic , high resolution simulations ( like those of nipoti et al .",
    "2007 and tiret & combes 2007 ) must be run in order to confirm that the non - adiabatically changing external field effect can indeed make the small boost to the los velocity dispersions in these satellites over the given orbits and timescales and even tidally disrupt draco .",
    "if it turns out that the external field effect is unable to disrupt draco given its orbital history then it poses a significant problem for mond .",
    "it is quite remarkable that using only the stellar mass of the dwarfs , we can successfully match the los velocity dispersion profiles with sensible falling anisotropies and get excellent reduced @xmath17 for all 8 dwarfs and 6/8 have good m / l . as for draco , the unknown orbital history is vital to the comprehension of its large m / l and until it is known , we can not confirm the dwarf galaxies of the mw as a success or failure of mond .",
