    "in the middle of the 80 s it was experimentally found that some light nuclei close to the neutron drip line have an spatial extension much larger than expected according to its mass number @xcite .",
    "this is the case for instance of @xmath2li , that has a root mean square radius similar to a nucleus with a mass number three times larger .",
    "very soon it was suggested that these nuclei could be understood as a core surrounded by one or more neutrons , which extend to several times the nuclear radius @xcite .",
    "this picture was supported by subsequent studies that proved the validity of the few  body models as an appropriate method to describe the most general properties of halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "the term halo nuclei has then been coined to describe very weakly bound and spatially extended systems , where several ( usually one or two ) neutrons have a high probability of being at distances larger than the typical nuclear radius . for a general overview of their basic properties",
    "see for instance @xcite . among halo nuclei",
    "a lot of attention has been paid to two  neutron halo systems from which @xmath0he ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath2li ( @xmath4li @xmath5 ) are their maximum exponents @xcite .",
    "they are samples of the so called borromean nuclei , that have the property of being bound while all the two  body subsystems made by two of the three constituents are unbound .",
    "the ability to produce secondary beams of halo nuclei opened the possibility of investigating their structure by the measurement of the momentum distributions of the fragments coming out after a collision with stable nuclei @xcite .",
    "the simplest approach to the understanding of borromean nuclei fragmentation reactions was made by means of the sudden approximation @xcite , that assumes that one of the three particles in the projectile is instantaneously removed by the target , while the other two particles remain undisturbed .",
    "clearly this can only be justified for reaction times much shorter than the characteristic time for the motion of the three particles in the system .",
    "since the system is weakly bound this requirement is well fulfilled for a high energy beam .",
    "this model was proved to be valid to describe the core momentum distributions @xcite , but it failed in the attempt of reproducing experimental momentum distributions for neutrons .",
    "several authors suggested that the final interaction between the two non  disturbed particles played an essential role , especially when low  lying resonances are present @xcite .",
    "incorporation into the model of the final state interaction @xcite is in fact necessary in order to obtain a good agreement between theory and experiment also for neutron momentum distributions .",
    "indeed further refinements @xcite in the description of the reaction process have been proved to be crucial for a better interpretation of the experimental data .    although a lot of information has been extracted from the halo nucleus ",
    "nucleus fragmentation reactions , it may pay to look for cleaner ways of investigating the structure of halo nuclei . as in any nucleus ",
    "nucleus collision the effects of the strong interaction involved in the reaction mechanism are mixed with those determining the nuclear structure .",
    "it is very well known that the way to avoid this problem is to substitute the hadron probe by electrons .",
    "in fact electron scattering is usually considered as the most powerful tool to investigate nuclear structure @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic coupling constant is small enough such that the born approximation can be used , the electron ",
    "nucleus interaction is well described through qed , and it is possible to vary independently the momentum transfer and the energy transfer to the nucleus .",
    "the problem when dealing with halo nuclei is that they are far from the stability region , and the nuclear target can not be at rest as in conventional nuclear structure studies with electron beams .",
    "however it is in principle possible to perform electron scattering experiments by means of the collision between a secondary beam of unstable nuclei and an electron beam .",
    "this kind of experiments are part of the muses ( multiusse experimental storage rings ) project in riken , and they are projected for the beginning of the coming century @xcite .    in parallel with the experimental projects it is then clear that theoretical studies of the process should be developed .",
    "from the experimental point of view the simplest reaction would be the elastic scattering .",
    "this would permit to investigate the charge density of the halo nucleus .",
    "this is specially interesting when the proton dripline is approached because it directly gives the extension of the possible proton halo ( @xmath6b is a good candidate for this ) . for neutron halos",
    "the charge radius is expected to be the one of the core .",
    "elastic electron scattering on @xmath2li or @xmath0he will be important to confirm that this picture of neutron halo nuclei is correct .",
    "as one slightly increases the energy transfer to the nucleus the halo will break up , and coincidence @xmath7 measurements can be made , with @xmath8 either a halo neutron or the stable core .    the main goal of this paper is to contribute to the first steps in the investigation of electron scattering reactions on two  neutron halo nuclei . to illustrate the model we will consider the case of electron@xmath0he scattering .",
    "although estimates of the elastic scattering reaction will be given , most of the work will be devoted to @xmath9 and @xmath10 reactions at quasielastic kinematics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : a brief description of kinematics and of elastic scattering reactions is given in sections ii and iii , respectively . the differential cross section for exclusive @xmath7 processes",
    "is given in section iv .",
    "sections v and vi are devoted to the theoretical description of the different ingredients involved in the electron@xmath0he scattering process and to the presentation of the results , respectively .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section vii .    2",
    "in fig.1a we show the scheme of a general electron scattering reaction .",
    "an electron with energy and momentum @xmath11 hits a target with energy and momentum @xmath12 .",
    "the energy and momentum transfer to the nucleus is denoted by @xmath13 , and the energy and momentum of the scattered electron and the final nuclear system are given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .    in fig.1b",
    "we show our axis system .",
    "the @xmath16axis is chosen along the momentum transfer @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18axis is defined along @xmath19 , and it is therefore perpendicular to the scattering plane defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath8axis is defined by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are unit vectors along the @xmath16axis and @xmath18axis , respectively .",
    "the angle between @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the scattering angle @xmath25 .",
    "energy and momentum conservation in the process determine that @xmath26 and the energy and momentum transfer are related to the electron and nuclear energy and momentum by @xmath27    working in the frame of the nucleus ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) these expressions can be rewritten as @xmath30 and the invariant hadronic mass ( @xmath31 ) takes the form @xmath32    from eq.([eq2 ] ) we obtain that @xmath33 where ultrarelativistic electrons have been assumed ( the electron mass is neglected ) .    in the case of",
    "_ elastic _ scattering the invariant hadronic mass coincides with the mass of the target ( @xmath34 ) , and eq.([eq4 ] ) leads to @xmath35 that is the kinetic energy of the final nucleus : @xmath36    assuming that the two  neutron halo nucleus has no excited bound states ( as it happens in @xmath0he ) an increase of the energy transfer to the nucleus will break the halo system into its three constituents . the energy and momentum of the final hadronic system can then be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are the energy and momentum of the three fragments .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) to ( [ eq4 ] ) are then valid in this region after substitution on them of eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "processes involving excitations and one nucleon knockout from the core may take place at higher energies , and will not be discussed here .",
    "these breakup processes will be studied assuming that the whole energy and momentum transfer are absorbed by one of the constituents ( participant ) , which is knocked out from the halo system .",
    "the other two constituents are mere spectators . the large extension of the nucleus supports this picture , since the probability for simultaneous interaction with the electron of two of the nuclear constituents is small .",
    "the scheme of the reaction can be seen in fig.2 .",
    "if we consider constituent 3 as the participant one , we then have @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the energy and momentum of the participant constituent inside the halo nucleus .    in the target frame ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 )",
    "we have that @xmath42 , and @xmath43 assuming non relativistic kinetic energies for the three fragments we have @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the halo binding energy , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the masses and final kinetic energies of the three constituents of the halo nucleus , and @xmath48 is the kinetic energy of the system made by particles 1 and 2 referred to its own center of mass .    from eq.([eq10 ] ) one can see that for a fixed value of the momentum transfer @xmath17 the variation in the energy transfer @xmath49 is connected to the different values of the internal momentum @xmath50 of the participant particle . actually , for a fixed value of the momentum transfer , electron ",
    "nucleus scattering cross sections show a broad peak known as the quasielastic peak whose center is placed at @xmath51 . neglecting the binding energy @xmath45 and the internal energy @xmath48 we obtain from eq.([eq10 ] ) the following value for the energy transfer in the center of the quasielastic peak @xmath52 that corresponds to the kinetic energy transferred to a particle of mass @xmath53 at rest .",
    "reactions taking place in a quasielastic peak region are interpreted as processes where a single constituent in the nucleus absorbs the whole energy and momentum transfer , being ejected from the nucleus .",
    "when the participant particle is the core , the center of the quasielastic peak is at smaller energy than when the participant particle is one of the halo neutrons . in the @xmath0he case",
    "@xmath54 is approximately four times smaller for a participant @xmath55he than for a participant neutron .    in this paper",
    "the exclusive @xmath7 reactions will be investigated in the so called _ perpendicular kinematics _",
    ", where the energy and momentum transfer are maintained fixed . in this",
    "kinematics , for a given electron beam with energy and momentum @xmath11 , the scattering angle @xmath25 and the energy of the outgoing electron @xmath56 are fixed during the experiment . from ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] )",
    "it is clear that @xmath25 and @xmath56 can be chosen in such a way that @xmath49 and @xmath17 take the desired values . in particular , for a fixed value of @xmath17 the energy transfer will be taken as shown in ( [ qep ] ) .",
    "we are then working in the center of a quasielastic peak .",
    "the energy transfer in the center of the quasielastic peak obviously increases with the momentum transfer @xmath57 .",
    "if this momentum is such that @xmath49 is larger than the separation energy of the nucleons in core , then a neutron detected in coincidence with the electron could come from the core instead of coming from the halo .",
    "therefore if @xmath49 is maintained below the separation energy of the nucleons in the core we guarantee that the halo nucleus is broken in only its three constituents . in particular , for @xmath0he , since the neutron or proton separation energy in @xmath55he is around 20 mev a momentum transfer smaller than 200 mev / c would satisfy this condition . at the same time a value of @xmath49 below 20 mev is also unable to excite the @xmath1 particle to its first excited state .    from eq.([eq6 ] ) and assuming that @xmath58 we can write @xmath59 if we now take @xmath60 mev / c and let the energy transfer take the value @xmath61 ( @xmath62 mev ) , it is then simple to see from eq.([balance ] ) that this energy can be absorbed by a participant @xmath1 particle ( @xmath63 ) with rather low internal momentum ( smaller than a few mev / c ) .",
    "if for the same value of @xmath49 we consider that the participant particle is one of the halo neutrons ( @xmath64 ) the required internal momentum of the neutron has to be very large ( typically of several hundreds of mev / c ) .",
    "however the probability of finding a halo neutron in @xmath0he with such a large momentum is basically zero @xcite .",
    "in the same way , from eq.([balance ] ) one sees that if @xmath65 ( @xmath66 mev for @xmath60 mev / c ) a participant neutron with small momentum can absorb such an energy , but it can not be absorbed by a participant @xmath1 particle .",
    "therefore , assuming that the reaction picture shown in fig.2 is valid ( a single constituent acts as participant while the other two are just spectators ) , we can then conclude that an energy transfer in the center of the @xmath1 quasielastic peak ( @xmath67 selects the @xmath1 as participant particle , and a halo neutron if @xmath49 is in the center of the neutron quasielastic peak ( @xmath68 .",
    "the general expression for the elastic electron scattering cross section can be found for instance in @xcite . in particular for a nucleus with spin zero , as @xmath0he ,",
    "the elastic cross section in the nucleus frame takes the form @xmath69 where the ultrarelativistic limit for the electrons has been assumed , @xmath70 defines the direction of the outgoing electron , and @xmath71 are the mott cross section and the recoil factor .",
    "the charge form factor @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the charge density .",
    "assuming that the picture of a core plus several halo neutrons is valid to describe neutron halo nuclei , the charge density should be practically identical to the one of the core . therefore , since the neutron contribution to the charge form factor will be negligible at moderate @xmath57values , the charge form factor should be the one obtained in an elastic electron  core scattering process .    to simplify the analysis we take the experimental charge density of @xmath55he that can be found in table v of @xcite .",
    "the root mean square radius of the charge distribution is 1.68 fm , and the charge form factor is shown in fig.3 by the solid line .",
    "this should then be the charge form factor obtained after elastic electron scattering on @xmath0he provided that the three  body picture is correct .",
    "the other limit would be to consider that the charge is not contained only in the core but distributed like matter over the whole nucleus . in that case",
    "the charge form factor would be the one shown in fig.3 by the dashed line .",
    "the form factor is now narrower due to the larger value of the charge radius .",
    "this curve has been obtained by modifying the range of the gaussians describing the @xmath55he charge density in @xcite in order to get a root mean square radius of the charge distribution of 2.5 fm , similar to the size of @xmath0he .    from fig.3",
    "we can conclude that elastic electron scattering from @xmath0he , or in general from neutron halo nuclei , is an excellent tool to determine to what extent the few ",
    "body description is valid .",
    "the inset in fig.3 shows the charge density for two cases mentioned above .",
    "center of mass corrections , also contained in the recoil factor of eq.([ee ] ) , may slightly modify the form factor and the charge r.m.s .",
    "radius of @xmath0he relative to that of @xmath55he .",
    "these effects could be accounted for using the three ",
    "body wave functions employed in the next sections .",
    "however , to give a first estimate of the size of the differential cross sections the two extreme pictures presented in fig.3 serve the purpose .",
    "for instance , for @xmath75 mev and @xmath76 degrees , the differential cross section is of around 100 @xmath77 .",
    "in this section we enter in the study of the coincidence @xmath7 processes , with @xmath8 either a halo neutron or the core .",
    "the scheme of the reaction was shown in fig.2 . a three  body system with energy and momentum",
    "@xmath12 interacts with an electron with energy and momentum @xmath11 . the whole energy and momentum transfer @xmath13",
    "is absorbed by one of the three constituents of the nucleus ( constituent 3 ) that is ejected out from the three - body halo system .",
    "the energies and momenta in the final state are denoted by @xmath78 where @xmath79 for the electron and @xmath39 for the three halo constituents .",
    "together with the impulse approximation ( the virtual photon is absorbed by a single constituent ) we also neglect the coulomb distortion of the ingoing and outgoing electrons .",
    "they are then described as plane waves . at the same time the distortion due to the final strong interaction between particle 3 ( participant ) and the two  body subsystem made by particles 1 and 2 ( spectators ) is also neglected , and the knocked out constituent is also described as a plane wave . on the contrary ,",
    "the interaction between particles 1 and 2 is included in the calculation .",
    "this interaction is what in refs .",
    "@xcite is referred to as final state interaction , and plays an essential role in the description of the halo nucleus fragmentation reactions .",
    "our picture is then similar to that described for instance in @xcite for @xmath80 reactions in pwia .",
    "the only difference ( but important ) is that our _ residual _ nucleus is an unbound two  body system , while they consider that the residual nucleus is in a well defined bound state .    in appendix",
    "a it is shown that working in the frame of the three  body halo nucleus ( @xmath81 ) the transition matrix element of the reaction has the form ( [ matrix ] )    @xmath82    where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the initial and final total energies , and analogously for the initial and final total momenta @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the jacobi coordinates @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( see fig.2 ) are defined in ( [ jac ] ) and their conjugated momenta @xmath89 and @xmath90 are given in ( [ mom ] ) .",
    "the momenta in the final state are denoted with primes .",
    "the spinor @xmath91 describes a free electron with momentum @xmath92 and third spin component @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath94 is the matrix element in momentum space of the current operator connecting states of the particle 3 with spin projections @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( eq.([cur ] ) ) . in ( eq.([sudd ] ) ) we have also defined @xmath97 , which is the overlap between the initial three ",
    "body halo wave function ( @xmath98 ) and the continuum wave function of the final two  body subsystem ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "when the interaction between particles 1 and 2 is neglected @xmath97 becomes the fourier transform ( normalized to 1 ) of the three - body halo wave function .",
    "@xmath100 and @xmath101 are the total spin and its third component of the two  body system made by particles 1 and 2",
    ".    we can now compute the differential cross section as the transition probability per unit volume and unit time ( @xmath102 ) divided by the flux of incident particles ( @xmath103 in the halo nucleus frame ) , divided by the number of target particles per unit volume ( @xmath104 ) and multiplied by the number of final states that is given by @xmath105    after averaging over initial states and summing over final states we obtain @xmath106 in this expression the integral over @xmath107 can be immediately done by use of the delta of momenta , getting that @xmath108 ( see eq.([relat ] ) ) .    in the ultrarelativistic limit",
    "it is known that @xcite @xmath109 where the leptonic tensor @xmath110 is @xmath111 and @xmath112 is the diagonal metric @xmath113 .    for a particle 3 with spin 0 or 1/2",
    "the matrix @xmath114 is diagonal and has both diagonal terms equal .",
    "the differential cross section can then be written @xmath115 with @xmath116 , and where we have defined the hadronic tensor @xmath117 ) , and has the standard form @xmath118 where the kinematic factors v s and the response functions @xmath119 s are given by @xmath120 as it can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "if particle 3 is the @xmath1particle the electron@xmath1 cross section reduces to @xmath121    explicit expressions for @xmath122 and @xmath123 are given in the next section .",
    "taking this into account the nine - differential cross section ( [ eq21 ] ) takes now the form @xmath124 where the delta of energies imposes that @xmath125 @xmath126 is the mass of the halo nucleus and @xmath127 is the internal energy of the final two  body system .    making use of the delta function one",
    "can integrate over @xmath128 , that leads to @xmath129 where @xmath130 , @xmath128 is obtained from ( [ delta ] ) , the angles @xmath131 and @xmath132 define the directions of @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively , and the recoil factor @xmath135 is given by @xmath136    finally , from ( [ inter ] ) we have that @xmath137 , and then one gets the familiar expression @xmath138 where @xmath139    we have then arrived in eq.([factor ] ) to the usual factorization of the cross section for an @xmath80 process in pwia @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section is written as product of the cross section of an electron  particle 3 scattering process and a function @xmath140 called spectral function .",
    "the spectral function is interpreted as the probability for the electron to remove a particle from the nucleus with internal momentum @xmath50 leaving the residual system with internal energy @xmath141 @xcite .    in stable nuclei the residual nucleus is usually considered to be in a bound state , in such a way that its internal energy can only take discrete values corresponding to the different excited states of the residual nucleus . if the missing energy ( defined as the part of the initial energy that is not transformed into kinetic energy ) is kept within the appropriate limits it is possible to select a specific state for the residual nucleus .",
    "this amounts to fix the internal energy @xmath141 to the value corresponding to a given excited state .",
    "the spectral function then gives the momentum distribution of the particle such that after removal leaves the residual nucleus in such an excited state .",
    "in our case the residual nucleus is not bound , but it is made by two particles flying together in the continuum . in other words ,",
    "the internal energy @xmath142 takes continuum values , and it is not possible to select a definite state for the final two  body system made by particles 1 and 2 . therefore integration over @xmath141",
    "is required , and @xmath143    note that the cross section @xmath144 and the recoil factor depend on @xmath134 ( @xmath130 ) , and @xmath128 is obtained from ( [ delta ] ) that depends on @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , the integration in ( [ dif5 ] ) involves the whole expression in ( [ factor ] ) , and the factorization disappears .    nevertheless , when the two  body system has resonances at low energy , @xmath141 can be neglected in eq.([delta ] ) , and the value of @xmath128 , and therefore @xmath144 and the recoil factor , are to a good approximation independent of @xmath141 . now",
    "the integral over @xmath141 involves only the spectral function , and we can then write @xmath145 where @xmath146 that can be interpreted as the momentum distribution of the constituent particle 3 .    if we now introduce eq.([nucleon ] ) or ( [ alpha ] ) , we can finally write @xmath147 or @xmath148 for the cases of participant neutron and participant @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath31 s are the usual structure functions , and they are product of the momentum distribution @xmath149 and the corresponding response function @xmath150 . the five  differential cross section ( [ fincross ] ) is formally identical to the expressions given for instance in @xcite for the @xmath80 cross section in pwia assuming a residual nucleus in a bound state",
    ". the response function for @xmath151 will be specified later .",
    "up to now we have always considered that the particle detected in coincidence with the electron is the participant particle ( particle 3 ) .",
    "however the case where one of the spectator particles ( particle 1 or 2 ) is detected in coincidence with the electron is also of interest .",
    "when one of the neutrons in the two  neutron halo nucleus is knocked out by the electron we actually have two neutrons in the final state , one of them participant and the other one spectator .",
    "when one neutron is detected it is obviously not possible to know which one was detected , and therefore both cases should be considered .    in eq.([cross ] ) we can use the delta of momenta to integrate over @xmath134 instead of @xmath107 ( @xmath152 ) . following the same steps we then arrive to an expression analogous to ( [ dif9 ] ) @xmath153    from eq.([mom ] ) we obtain @xmath154 from which it is easy to see that @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "using now the delta of energies we can integrate over @xmath157 and then get @xmath158 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 is obtained from ( [ delta ] ) ( using the relation @xmath159 and eq.([surv ] ) ) .",
    "the recoil factor @xmath135 is in this case the value of the inverse of the derivative of ( [ delta ] ) with respect to @xmath157 .    from ( [ newc ] )",
    "we obtain the five  differential cross section @xmath160 that is analogous to ( [ dif5 ] ) and where the momentum @xmath161 ( @xmath156 ) is now the momentum of one of the spectator particles in the final state .    in principle",
    "the differential cross sections ( [ dif5 ] ) and ( [ dif5b ] ) depend on five variables ( @xmath56 and four angles ) .",
    "however electron scattering experiments are normally performed in what is known as _ in plane _ kinematics .",
    "this means that only particles in the scattering plane are detected .",
    "we then restrict ourselves to processes in the @xmath162plane ( see fig.1b ) , and the azimuthal angles @xmath163 , @xmath164 ( in ( [ dif5 ] ) ) , and @xmath165 ( in ( [ dif5b ] ) ) are taken equal to zero .",
    "the number of variables is reduced now to three . working in perpendicular kinematics",
    "the energy transfer to the nucleus is kept fixed , and for a given incident electron energy @xmath166 one has @xmath167 .",
    "there are then only two variables left , @xmath168 and @xmath169 in ( [ dif5 ] ) , and @xmath168 and @xmath170 in ( [ dif5b ] ) .",
    "finally we also know that @xmath171 , and multiplying this expression by @xmath21 we obtain in the ultrarelativistic limit @xmath172 and therefore the differential cross sections in the _ in plane _ perpendicular kinematics are simply a function of the polar angle @xmath169 in ( [ dif5 ] ) or @xmath170 in ( [ dif5b ] ) .    as mentioned in the previous section , in case that we neglect @xmath141 in ( [ delta ] ) the expression ( [ noep ] )",
    "is valid , and the observables can be given as function either of @xmath169 or of the internal momentum of the participant particle @xmath173 .",
    "this is because @xmath169 and @xmath173 are connected through the relation @xmath174 where @xmath128 is obtained from ( [ delta ] ) provided that @xmath141 is neglected .",
    "in order to obtain the coincidence differential cross sections given in ( [ dif5 ] ) and ( [ dif5b ] ) , we need to specify the spectral function ( [ spec ] ) of the halo nucleus and the elementary electron ",
    "neutron responses , the electron@xmath1 responses , and the cross sections .",
    "in particular , for the spectral function we need the probability function @xmath175    the calculation of this summation requires the knowledge of _ i ) _ the intrinsic wave function of the three  body halo nucleus @xmath98 , _ ii ) _ the continuum wave function @xmath99 of the spectator system in the final state , and _",
    "iii ) _ compute the overlap in eq.([sudd ] ) . when applying the model to a particular case",
    "the calculation of the wave functions need in its turn the interactions between the three constituents in the halo system . in the case of @xmath0he ,",
    "the neutron  neutron and neutron@xmath1 interactions need to be specified .      when the participant particle is one of the neutrons from the halo the electron ",
    "neutron cross section is needed .",
    "electron scattering by a free nucleon is a well understood reaction , and the only uncertainties come from the off  shell character of the nucleon interacting with the electron . for halo neutrons off  shell effects in the nucleon current can not be expected to be important , and we consider the cc1 prescription @xcite .",

    "since the @xmath1particle has spin zero , only the component with @xmath179 is non - zero in ( [ cur ] ) , and @xmath180 as a consequence only @xmath181 in ( [ vr ] ) is different from zero , and then @xmath182    the charge density @xmath183 for the @xmath1particle can be taken from @xcite , where it is parameterized as a sum of gaussians , as discussed in section iii .",

    "we consider that we are in the corresponding quasielastic peak , i.e. the energy transfer is @xmath263 where @xmath186 is the neutron mass in the first case and the @xmath55he mass in the second case .",

    "as already mentioned , this function gives the probability of removing the participant particle with momentum @xmath173 leaving the residual system with energy @xmath141 .",
    "2    let us start with the case of a participant neutron .",
    "the spectral function is shown in fig.4 , and reflects the momentum distribution of the internal nucleon and the energy spectrum of the unbound system @xmath262he . in the left part of the figure we show the spectral function itself , while the right part shows the projection over the basis .",
    "the spectral function has a peak whose precise position is easily seen in the right part of the figure .",
    "the maximum value corresponds to a @xmath262he energy of roughly @xmath265 mev , that is the energy of the lowest @xmath260 resonance in @xmath262he ( 0.77 mev @xcite ) .",
    "the width of this resonance is relatively small ( less than 0.7 mev ) , and this makes the peak clearly pronounced .",
    "the next resonance in @xmath262he ( @xmath261 ) has an energy of around 2 mev , and it should also appear in the figure .",
    "however , its large width , more than 5 mev , makes this resonance to be smeared out and hidden by the @xmath260 .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in subsection v.d , more than 82% of the norm of the @xmath0he wave function is given by the @xmath260 wave , while the @xmath261 only gives around 6% .",
    "the presence of @xmath230waves in the @xmath0he wave function ( @xmath266 10% ) makes the spectral function non zero along the @xmath267 edge .    in fig.5",
    "we show the same as in fig.4 but for the case where the @xmath1particle is scattered away by the electron , and the two neutrons act as spectators . in this case",
    "the overlap ( [ overl ] ) is computed writing the @xmath0he wave function in terms of the jacobi coordinates with @xmath211 connecting both neutrons . from table",
    "[ tab1 ] we know that both neutrons are preferably in a relative @xmath230state , and this will produce a non zero spectral function along the @xmath268 axis .",
    "the fact that the spectral function is proportional to @xmath269 ( see eq.([spec2 ] ) ) will make the function equal to zero at the origin .",
    "this peaked spectral function close to the origin reflects the fact that the @xmath229 interaction has a very large scattering length for the @xmath270wave ( more than 23 fm ) , giving rise to a virtual state at very low energy ( less than 100 kev ) .",
    "after integration of the spectral function over the internal two  body energy @xmath141 we obtain the internal momentum distribution of the participant particle ( eq.([eq35 ] ) ) . in fig.6a we show the computed neutron momentum distribution after integration over @xmath141 of the spectral function in fig.4 ( solid line ) .",
    "the contributions to the total from the @xmath271 wave ( short  dashed line ) , @xmath261 wave ( dot  dashed line ) , and @xmath260 wave ( long  dashed line ) are also shown .",
    "it may look that the @xmath230wave contribution is much larger than the 10% given in table i. this is because the whole contribution at the origin comes from the @xmath230 waves .",
    "however , when computing the normalization of the momentum distribution the phase volume contains a @xmath272 factor , that reduces the weight of the @xmath230 contribution . in the inset of fig.6a",
    "we show the neutron momentum distribution multiplied by @xmath272 .",
    "we clearly see that dominant contribution comes from the @xmath260 wave , while the @xmath230 contribution is small .    in fig.6b",
    "we show the same but for the case of participant @xmath1 . again",
    "the solid line shows the total @xmath1 momentum distribution , and the long  dashed and short  dashed correspond to the contributions from the @xmath230 and @xmath231 waves , respectively . in this case (",
    "table [ tab1 ] ) the dominant term is the relative neutron ",
    "neutron state with orbital angular momentum zero .",
    "in fact the long  dashed curve and the solid one coincide almost in the whole range of @xmath1 momenta .",
    "even when the momentum distribution is multiplied by the @xmath273 factor coming from the phase volume ( inset in fig.6b ) it is seen that the @xmath230 waves are the clearly dominant ones , and they are responsible for the pronounced peak observed in the spectral function in fig.5 .      to compute the cross sections ( [ dif5 ] ) and ( [ dif5b ] ) we work in the _ in plane _ perpendicular kinematics ( see end of section iv ) .",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath57 is fixed at a value of @xmath274 mev / c , and the energy transfer corresponds to the center of the quasielastic peaks ( @xmath275 ) , with @xmath64 or @xmath63 .",

    "_    let us first consider the case when @xmath49 corresponds to the center of the neutron quasielastic peak .",
    "as discussed at the end of section ii only a halo neutron can be the participant particle .",
    "if the particle detected in coincidence with the electron is the participant neutron ( @xmath9 process ) the cross section is given by eq.([dif5 ] ) .",
    "assuming that the internal energy @xmath141 can be neglected in eq.([delta ] ) the cross section can then also be written as shown in ( [ fincross ] ) .",
    "in fig.7 we show the differential cross section for this process .",
    "two cases have been considered , one of them at a forward scattering angle ( @xmath276 ) , and the second one at a backward scattering angle ( @xmath277 ) .",
    "the electron beam energy @xmath166 takes a value of 375 mev in the first case , and 108 mev in the second . in the figure",
    "the solid line is the calculation as given in eq.([dif5 ] ) .",
    "the dashed line is the calculation as in ( [ fincross ] ) where @xmath141 has been fully neglected in eq.([delta ] ) , i.e. @xmath278 .",
    "finally the long dashed line is the calculation as in ( [ fincross ] ) but taking @xmath279 mev in eq.([delta ] ) .",
    "this energy corresponds to the energy of the lowest @xmath231resonance in @xmath262he .    as seen in the figure the three computed cross sections are very similar , with only a small difference in the maximum , that is placed at a value of @xmath280 of roughly 10 degrees .",
    "when the approximation in ( [ fincross ] ) is used the chosen value for @xmath141 in eq.([delta ] ) is not very relevant , and only a full calculation as in ( [ dif5 ] ) reduces the maximum and the value at @xmath281 . in all cases the cross section is already negligible for outgoing neutrons with polar angle larger than 75 degrees .",
    "the calculations with different scattering angles differ roughly in a global scale factor .",
    "this is because for a participant neutron only the magnetic nucleon form factor is important .",
    "hence , in eq.([fincross ] ) the main contribution is given by the transverse structure function , and the whole dependence on the scattering angle is contained in the global factor @xmath282 . from eqs.([smott ] ) and ( [ vr ] ) one sees that @xmath282 goes like @xmath283 and scattering angles close to zero give a much larger contribution than scattering angles close to @xmath284 .",
    "this is seen in fig.7 , where the maximum value of the cross section is 8 times larger for @xmath276 than for @xmath277 . in the inset in fig.7",
    "we show the four response functions in eq.([fincross ] ) .",
    "it is clear that , as mentioned above , the dominant contribution is by far given by the transverse part .",
    "only @xmath285 gives an additional non negligible contribution .",
    "when the participant particle is one of the halo neutrons , either the second halo neutron or the core can also be detected in coincidence with the electron . in this case",
    "the cross section is given by eq.([dif5b ] ) , where @xmath286 is the momentum either of the spectator neutron or of the spectator core ( eq.([surv ] ) ) .",
    "the solid lines in fig.8a give the differential cross section when the particle detected in coincidence with the electron is the second neutron .",
    "therefore it also contributes to the @xmath287 coincidence cross section .",
    "the two cases with @xmath276 ( thick lines ) and @xmath277 ( thin lines ) are shown .",
    "as seen in the figure , for both scattering angles the maximum contribution to the cross section appears at an angle of around 70 degrees , value for which the cross sections shown in fig.7 are already small .",
    "furthermore for small angles the contribution to the @xmath287 coincidence cross section coming from the spectator neutron is more than 10 times smaller than the contribution from the participant neutron ( see fig.7 ) . in fig.8b",
    "we show the total differential cross section ( solid line ) of the @xmath287 coincidence reaction for @xmath276 .",
    "this curve is obtained by summing up the contribution from the participant neutron ( short  dashed line in fig.8b , or solid line for @xmath276 in fig.7 ) and the contribution from the spectator neutron ( thick solid line in fig.8a ) . from fig.8b it is then clear that the behavior of the cross section is dominated by the participant neutron , while the spectator neutron contributes with a roughly constant cross section that creates a long tail that extends all the way up to @xmath288 . when @xmath277 the difference is basically a global factor close to 8 .",
    "we also show in fig.8a the differential cross section for the @xmath289 coincidence process when the @xmath1 particle is a spectator .",
    "they are given by the dashed curves , and show a pronounced peak at 70 degrees .",
    "_ ii ) participant @xmath1 . _",
    "let us finish with the case when @xmath49 corresponds to the center of the @xmath1 quasielastic peak .",
    "the participant particle is then the @xmath1 , @xmath63 , and for @xmath274 mev / c the energy transfer is around 5 mev . neglecting @xmath141 in eq.([delta ] ) , and taking @xmath290 , it can be seen that the angle @xmath169 has to satisfy that @xmath291 .",
    "this relation is fulfilled for any angle when the participant particle is one of the halo neutrons , but when @xmath292 it gives a limit to the value of @xmath169 .",
    "in particular , for a participant @xmath1 particle one has that @xmath293 .",
    "this is also shown in fig.8b , where the dotted curve shows the differential cross section for an exclusive @xmath151 reaction in the center of the @xmath1 quasielastic peak .",
    "the cross section is zero for angles",
    "larger than 30 , and the maximum value at the origin is around twice the one obtained in the @xmath287 coincidence process . in the computation shown in the figure",
    "the scattering angle is 30 degrees , for which @xmath294 mev ( @xmath274 mev / c , @xmath295 ) . as seen in eq.([alpha ] ) , only a longitudinal structure function enters in this case , and the whole dependence on the scattering angle is then contained in @xmath296 .",
    "therefore different scattering angles only introduce a global factor determined by the ratio between the different values of the mott cross section .",
    "for instance , a scattering angle of 15 degrees would make the differential cross section four times larger than the one shown in the figure , while @xmath277 would make the cross section more than 200 times smaller than the one in the figure .",
    "after @xmath1 knockout by the electron the spectator neutrons could in principle be detected in coincidence with the outgoing electron .",
    "the computed cross section for this process is very small , and barely visible in the scale of fig.8b .",
    "the fact that electron scattering is one of the most powerful and cleanest procedures in order to investigate nuclear structure lead us to consider these reactions to investigate one of the most intriguing objects recently discovered in nuclear physics : halo nuclei .",
    "in particular we have considered the case of two  neutron halo nuclei .",
    " body wave function of the nucleus is obtained by solving the faddeev equations in coordinate space by means of the adiabatic hyperspherical expansion .",
    "as soon as the two  body interactions between the constituents of the nucleus are specified the three ",
    "body structure can be computed to the needed accuracy .",
    "first we have made a short incursion into elastic electron scattering reactions where we have seen the variation of the charge form factor according to two limiting values for the charge r.m.s .",
    "radius , the core size and the @xmath0he size .",
    "the validity of the three  body picture requires that the charge form factor for @xmath0he and @xmath55he should be similar . in other words , if the present picture of @xmath0he as a @xmath55he core and two halo neutrons is correct , the elastic differential cross section for @xmath0he should be practically identical to that of @xmath55he , while if the spatial charge distribution of @xmath0he would be as extended as that of the neutrons , the cross section would be at least four times smaller at typical @xmath57 values of 200  300 mev / c .",
    "thus elastic electron scattering provides a direct test of the halo picture",
    ".    then we make an extensive discussion of @xmath297 processes , that are described in the impulse approximation , i.e. the virtual photon is absorbed by a single constituent of the halo nucleus .",
    "the quasielastic exclusive electron scattering formalism was developed years ago ( see for instance @xcite ) , and in principle one could directly apply it to electron scattering on halo nuclei .",
    "however , the language used in the three  body description of the halo nucleus ( inert core , jacobi coordinates , ... ) is not easily matched with the language commonly used in electron scattering , where the single  particle properties of nuclei play an important role .",
    "one of the main aims of this paper has been to obtain the differential cross section for electron scattering using the three ",
    "body wave function of the halo nucleus as starting point .",
    "comparison of the derived cross section with the well known expression for quasielastic exclusive electron scattering permits an easy identification of the observables of interest : spectral function , response functions , and momentum distributions .",
    "after discussion of the kinematics of the reaction we have applied the method to electron scattering on @xmath0he , for which the two  body interactions between its three constituents are well known .",
    "these interactions reproduce the basic properties of the nucleus , separation energy and root mean square radius , together with an important amount of experimental data obtained after fragmentation on stable targets .",
    "uncertainties coming from a poor description of the halo nucleus are then minimized .",
    "we have investigated the different observables for the cases of a participant neutron and a participant @xmath1 .",
    "we have first studied the spectral function , that carries the whole information about the structure of the two  body subsystem obtained after removal by the electron of one of the constituents of @xmath0he .",
    "this function is interpreted as the probability of removing one of the constituents with a certain momentum leaving the residual system with a certain energy .",
    "effects due to the presence of different partial waves can be observed , as well as indications about the resonance structure of the surviving unbound two  body subsystem .",
    "of special interest is the case of neutron removal , since the spectral function directly gives information about the unbound nucleus @xmath262he .",
    "after integration of the spectral function over the energy we obtain the momentum distribution of the participant particle , that contains information about the weight of each partial wave in the wave function .",
    "experimental information about the momentum distribution can in principle be obtained by taking the ratio between the measured cross section and the electron ",
    "participant particle cross section .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the factorization of the five  differential cross section is only approximated , and low lying resonances in the final unbound two  body system are required .",
    "for the same reason as before , low lying resonances in the two  body system are necessary in order to write the five  differential cross section in terms of the response functions ( that are simply the product of the momentum distribution and the corresponding single  particle response function ) .",
    "this can always be done when the residual nuclear system is bound .",
    "we have seen that for @xmath262he ( that has a resonance at an energy of around 0.8 mev ) the approximated differential cross section does not differ very much from the exact one , and it is therefore possible to talk about response functions in this kind of reactions .",
    "such a response functions have been obtained for the case of a participant neutron , where the transverse response clearly dominates , and for a participant @xmath1 , where only the longitudinal one enters .    in summary ,",
    "as for any nucleus , electron scattering is probably the most accurate procedure in order to investigate the structure of halo nuclei . due to",
    "the up to now unattainable technical problems , experimental measurements are not available , and these reactions have been completely unexplored .",
    "fortunately the first experiments of this kind are projected for the next few years @xcite , and theoretical studies as the ones presented here are then needed .",
    "we have derived the cross section and investigated for the case of the two  neutron halo nucleus @xmath0he how the observables are connected to the structure of the nucleus .",
    "we show results for differential cross sections corresponding to elastic scattering as well as to quasielastic scattering on a neutron halo and on the @xmath55he core , illustrating how the different kinematical regions probe the charge distribution , the spectral function and the momentum distributions in a transparent manner .",
    "additional information could also be obtained exploiting spin polarization degrees of freedom , which are not discussed here given the incipient state of the subject .",

    "if we denote by @xmath298 ( @xmath299 ) the position of the electron and the three particles in the halo nucleus we then define the coordinates : @xmath300    the coordinates @xmath211 and @xmath212 are the jacobi coordinates except for the mass factors that are usually introduced and that for simplicity have been omitted here ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the conjugated momenta associated to the coordinates @xmath211 , @xmath212 , and @xmath301 are @xmath302 and the same with primes in the final state .",
    "the masses of the three halo constituents are denoted by @xmath46 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "working in the frame of the halo nucleus ( @xmath303 ) one has @xmath304    following @xcite in the one photon exchange approximation the transition matrix element for an electron scattering process is given by @xmath305 where @xmath306 are the initial and final electron wave functions , that are given by @xmath307 @xmath308 that are normalized to 1 in a volume @xmath309 .",
    "@xmath310 and @xmath311 are the third components of the spin for the ingoing and outgoing electrons , respectively .",
    "the four - vector @xmath312 is the potential ( scalar and vector ) generated by the nucleus and seen by the electron at the instant @xmath313 in the position @xmath314 .",
    "substituting ( [ ini ] ) and ( [ fin ] ) into ( [ mat ] ) one has @xmath315    making use of the maxwell equations one has @xmath316 and the transition matrix element takes the form @xcite @xmath317 where @xmath318 is the nuclear current operator ( @xmath319 ) .",
    "the initial hadronic state @xmath320 is given by the three  body halo wave function that is written as @xmath321 with @xmath322 and @xmath98 is the intrinsic three  body halo wave function with spin @xmath185 and third component @xmath186 .",
    "the wave function of the two  body system made by particles 1 and 2 in the final state is written as @xmath323 where @xmath324 is the intrinsic continuum wave function , @xmath100 is the coupling of the spins of both particles and @xmath101 its third component , and @xmath325 .",
    "the final hadronic state @xmath326 is made by the product of eq.([sys12 ] ) and the plane wave describing the outgoing particle 3 @xmath327 where @xmath328 is the spin state of particle 3 in the final state .",
    "according to the scheme shown in fig.2 particle 3 is the only constituent interacting with the electron .",
    "the rest of them are just spectators .",
    "the nuclear current operator should then be the one associated to the hadron labeled by 3 . assuming that this current operator depends only on the distance @xmath16 between particle 3 and the electron and substituting ( [ 3bod ] ) , ( [ sys12 ] ) , and ( [ par3 ] ) into ( [ mat3 ] ) a little algebra leads to @xmath329 where we have used that @xmath330 , and where the integrations over @xmath313 and @xmath314 give rise to the deltas forcing energy and momentum conservation . @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the initial and final total energies , and analogously for the initial and final total momenta @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "in deriving ( [ mat4 ] ) we have also used that particle 3 absorbs the whole energy and momentum transfer to the nucleus , and then in the frame of the three  body halo system one has @xmath331 therefore in this picture the center of mass momentum of the final two  body system made by particles 1 and 2 reveals the internal momentum of the participant particle 3 .",
    "we denote now @xmath332 that is the matrix element in momentum space of the current operator connecting states of particle 3 with spin projections @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we also define @xmath333 that is the overlap between the initial three  body halo wave function and the wave function of the final two  body system (",
    "the exponential is the two  body center of mass motion ) .",
    "when the interaction between particles 1 and 2 is neglected the distorted function @xmath99 becomes a plane wave ( @xmath334 ) and ( [ sudd ] ) is the fourier transform ( normalized to 1 ) of the three - body halo wave function .    with ( [ cur ] ) and ( [ sudd ] ) we can finally write the transition matrix element ( [ mat4 ] ) in the form @xmath335",
    "for the off  shell electron - nucleon cross section we have chosen what in refs.@xcite is called prescription cc1 with current conservation .",
