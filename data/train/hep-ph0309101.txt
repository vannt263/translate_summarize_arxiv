    "the understanding of strongly interacting fermion systems is one of the great challenges for theoretical physics , ranging from condensed matter systems and ultracold atoms to strong interactions in particle physics .",
    "non - perturbative methods need to be explored in order to deal with strong effective interactions , collective phenomena , condensates in competing channels and different characteristic physics at `` microscopic '' and `` macroscopic '' distances . in this note",
    "we deal with the bosonic effective action based on a two - particle irreducible formalism and the schwinger - dyson equations in a situation where the dominant interactions involve more than four fermions .",
    "we also compare with mean field theory .",
    "indeed , for some physical systems the higher order fermion interactions play a crucial role . as a concrete example we discuss the instanton interaction in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) with three flavors of quarks .",
    "the violation of the axial @xmath1-symmetry by instanton effects induces an effective six - quark - interaction which involves all three flavors @xcite .",
    "it has been speculated that this instanton mediated interaction may become dominant at a characteristic momentum scale below @xmath2 .",
    "we explore here a model where the instanton mediated interaction dominates the effective theory at some given scale @xmath3 .",
    "this scale will act as an ultraviolet cutoff for the fluctuations with momenta @xmath4 which induce condensates and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we concentrate on the pointlike limit of this interaction and neglect all other effective interactions between the quarks .",
    "we do not believe that this model is a sufficient description for real qcd but it points to some characteristic features and serves as an interesting demonstration for the more formal part of this work .",
    "first investigations of strongly interacting fermionic systems are often based on mean field theory ( mft ) or lowest order schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) @xcite .",
    "for example , the recent studies of color superconductivity @xcite are mainly based on one of these methods .",
    "both methods allow for a computation of the order parameter in systems which exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) .",
    "however , while the sde approach leads directly to the gap equation , the mft approach provides naturally a free energy functional for the bosonic composite degrees of freedom introduced by partial bosonization via a hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xcite .",
    "the minima of the free energy are determined by the field equation which corresponds to a type of gap equation .",
    "knowledge of the free energy functional becomes necessary if the gap ( or field ) equation allows solutions with different order parameters and the free energy for the different solutions has to be compared .    within the sde approach",
    "the reconstruction of the free energy functional from the gap equation is not trivial since the information about the minima ( as expressed by the gap equation ) may be insufficient in order to find the whole function .",
    "for example , it is not sure that the method used in @xcite for the case of color superconductivity always works .",
    "from this point of view mft seems superior to sde since it directly provides a free energy .",
    "unfortunately , mft has also a severe disadvantage : partial bosonization is not unique and the results of the mft calculation depend strongly on the choice of the mean field ( see @xcite for the example of the hubbard model where this has drastic consequences ) .",
    "since partial bosonization is an exact procedure physical results should be independent of this choice .",
    "indeed , the ambiguity is due to the approximation used in mft ( only fermionic fluctuations are taken into account ) and is cured by more sophisticated approximations @xcite .",
    "being a purely fermionic formulation sde s do not suffer from such an ambiguity .",
    "hence , we want to find a functional which has the sde as its equation of motion , and which can be interpreted as a free energy . for four fermion interactions such a functional",
    "can be related to the two particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action @xcite .",
    "the 2pi effective action is a functional of fields and propagators @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "however , for a purely fermionic system , all the information is already contained in @xmath6 $ ] where the `` fermionic background field '' is set to zero .",
    "hence @xmath6 $ ] depends only on the bosonic variable @xmath7 , and therefore we will call it the bosonic effective action ( bea ) @xcite . in a suitable version",
    "the bea is a free energy functional and the condition for its local minima precisely corresponds to the gap equation .",
    "the work of @xcite has concentrated on effective four fermion interactions . in the present paper",
    "we want to deal with more general multi - fermion interactions .",
    "an example of such a higher order interaction is the six - fermion interaction generated by instantons in the case of three flavors and three colors @xcite .",
    "this interaction is @xmath1-anomalous and solves the famous @xmath1-problem @xcite in qcd . in the simpler case of two flavors",
    "the instantons mediate a four fermion interaction which has already been studied extensively for chiral symmetry breaking @xcite and was considered in the early works on color superconductivity e.g. @xcite .",
    "this investigation is generalized here to three light flavors of quarks which are perhaps closer to realistic qcd .",
    "we also perform a more systematic discussion of the free energy functional .",
    "we observe that the effective interaction generated by the instantons does not only lead to interactions between color singlet effective quark - antiquark degrees of freedom which are finally associated to the usual spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it also produces effective interactions between color octets . in a model that goes beyond the six quark interactions the instanton effects may lead to the possibility of octet condensation and spontaneous `` color symmetry breaking '' @xcite .",

    ". gives the ( non - linear ) `` yukawa coupling '' of @xmath54 to the fermions , i.e. the relation between the gap and the bosonic field .",

    "however , the coefficients in the `` classical potential '' as well as in the `` gap '' @xmath45 differ .",

    "this is the so called  fierz ambiguity  because the addition of @xmath88 corresponds to a ( generalized ) fierz transformation in the fermionic language .",
    "of course , further considerations as e.g. the stability of the initial bosonic potential might reduce the freedom in the choice of @xmath88 somewhat .",
    "but , as the example of @xcite shows , such restrictions are sometimes not even strong enough to get qualitatively the same phase diagram for all reasonable choices of @xmath88 .",
    ", , do not suffer from such an ambiguity since in the derivation of the sde the coefficient becomes antisymmetrized and symmetric terms drop out . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the inclusion of appropriate diagrams for the bosonic fluctuations cures the fierz ambiguity for four fermion interactions and leads to the sd - result .",
    "we believe that this holds also for higher fermion interactions .",
    "nevertheless , the inclusion of the bosonic fluctuations needs a substantial effort .",
    "we therefore propose as a natural replacement of eq . which amounts to an `` optimal '' choice of @xmath81 for many purposes .",
