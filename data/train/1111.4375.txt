    "cohen s observation and the continued preponderance of examples that are interval graphs led to a large literature devoted to attempts to explain the observation and to study the properties of competition graphs .",

    "he then asked for a characterization of acyclic digraphs whose competition graphs are interval .",
    "the study of acyclic digraphs whose competition graphs are interval led to several new problems and applications ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the notion of a competition hypergraph which is a variant of a competition graph was introduced by sonntag and teichert @xcite . the _ competition hypergraph _",
    "@xmath17 of a digraph @xmath0 is a hypergraph without loops and multiple hyperedges such that the vertex set is the same as the vertex set of @xmath0 and @xmath18 is a hyperedge if and only if @xmath19 contains at least two vertices and @xmath19 coincides with the in - neighborhood of some vertex @xmath3 in @xmath0 .",
