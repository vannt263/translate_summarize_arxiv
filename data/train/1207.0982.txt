    "one of the cornerstones of introductory courses in classical mechanics is the derivation of kepler s laws . in particular , the derivation of kepler s first law , stating that the trajectory of a planet is an ellipse with the sun located at one of the foci , is an important application of newton s laws to a multidimensional problem .",
    "however , very few students are aware of the fact that the eccentricities of the planets of the solar system are actually quite small , with trajectories very close to a circle , which makes kepler s achievement ( based on tycho brahe s measurements ) even more remarkable .    here",
    ", i describe a simple measurement programme , suitable for first - year university students , consisting in measuring the elevation of the sun as a function of time during a day , and in repeating this typically once a week over a full year . by measuring the maximal elevation @xmath0 of the sun , and the time @xmath1",
    "at which this maximum occurs ( i.e. the _ true local noon _ ) , students can readily check that these quantities vary a lot over the year .",
    "the change in @xmath0 is essentially related to the obliquity @xmath2 of the earth over the ecliptic , and thus allows for quite an accurate determination of @xmath2 ( as well as that of the latitude of observation ) .",
    "the change of @xmath1 over a year gives an experimental determination of the _ equation of time _",
    "@xmath3 , i.e. the difference between the mean local noon and the true local noon , and allows for a determination of the eccentricity @xmath4 of the earth orbit  @xcite .",
    "this is a rewarding result for students to realize that with such simple measurements they can obtain good experimental values for the above quantities , and that with careful observations one can perform ` science without instruments ' as did the astronomers of various antique civilizations  @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "i first describe how to measure in a simple way the elevation of the sun versus time over a day , with an accuracy of about @xmath5 .",
    "then i give the results i obtained for @xmath6 and @xmath3 by repeating the measurement about once a week for one year , starting in august 2010 .",
    "i show how one can extract the obliquity @xmath2 of the earth s axis and the eccentricity @xmath4 of its orbit by fitting the experimental data with simple , analytic expressions .",
    "finally , possible extensions of the work are proposed .",
    "[ append : a ] contains a brief reminder on basic notions of spherical astronomy , and should be read first by readers not familiar with these notions . in the remaining appendices , the derivation of the analytic expressions used for fitting the data is given , so that the article is self - contained .",
    "we are interested in studying the motion of the earth around the sun . using the relativity of motion , we can thus simply measure the apparent motion of the sun on the celestial sphere , i.e. the time - dependance of two angles that define the position of the sun in the sky .",
    "as we shall see , for our purpose , it is sufficient to measure the elevation of the sun ( also called _ altitude _ , or _ height _ ) above the horizon , i.e. the angle @xmath7 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "this can be done very simply by measuring the length @xmath8 of the shadow of a vertical _ gnomon _",
    "( i.e. a rod with a sharp point ) of length @xmath9",
    ". then the elevation of the sun is given by @xmath10 .",
    "contrary to the case where one would measure also the azimuthal position of the sun , here , the orientation of the horizontal base does not need to be fixed .",
    "one of the advantages of using such a simple setup is therefore that one can change the position of the sundial over the course of the day , e.g. in order to operate indoor .          in practice ,",
    "i used as a gnomon a steel nail protruding from a plywood base of size @xmath11  @xmath12 . in order to have the nail as orthogonal to the base as possible",
    ", a hole with a diameter slightly less than that of the nail was first drilled into the plate using a drill press .",
    "the nail i used has a length @xmath13  mm above the plate . to measure @xmath7 ,",
    "one simply installs this elementary sundial on a horizontal surface in the sunlight , and measures with a ruler the length of the shadow .",
    "two effects limit the accuracy of the measurement : first , due to the final angular diameter of the sun , the shadow is slightly blurred ; second , the horizontality of the base when installed on the floor of a room , or on a table , is not perfect  @xcite . in practice , an accuracy of typically one degree is easily obtained ( this can be estimated quantitatively by repeating the measurement several times with the sundial in different positions , in a short interval over which @xmath7 barely varies , and observing the dispersion of the results ) .    concerning the determination of the time @xmath14 at which @xmath15 is measured , an accuracy of one minute is sufficient for our purpose , and thus a simple wristwatch can be used .",
    "however it is wise to check that the watch indicates the correct time before starting a series of measurements .",
    "nowadays , this can be done very easily using the websites of national time agencies  @xcite that give access to the legal time with an accuracy of one second or better .",
    "figure  [ fig : elev ] shows two measurements of @xmath15 , where @xmath14 is the legal time , performed in toulouse , france ( latitude @xmath16  n , longitude @xmath17  e ) at two different dates .",
    "it is very clear from the data that the maximal height @xmath0 of the sun depends on the date ; this is in general well known as it is related to the cycle of seasons .",
    "however , what appears also clearly on fig .",
    "[ fig : elev ] is that the time @xmath1 at which this maximum occurs also depends on the date ; this however is not widely known by the students , nor even by some physicists , probably because the effect is relatively small ( a few minutes ) though perfectly measurable even with our crude setup .    in order to proceed ,",
    "we need to extract from @xmath15 the two quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the theoretical expression of @xmath15 is derived in [ sec : theorelev ] ; however we can at this stage keep an empiric approach and just fit the data with a simple function .",
    "as @xmath15 is symmetric about @xmath18 ( provided one neglects the motion of the sun with respect to the fixed stars over a few hours , which is reasonable given the accuracy of our measurements ) , i chose to fit the data with the following polynomial : @xmath19 where the five adjustable parameters are @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and the coefficients @xmath20 .",
    "i chose to go up to sixth order in order to get a nicer fit at small elevations ( in the mornings and evenings ) but if the data is taken only for a few hours around @xmath1 ( @xmath21 to 4  hours around @xmath1 are enough to determine the quantities of interest ) one can use only a fourth - order polynomial without affecting the results .",
    "such fits are shown as solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : elev ] .",
    "the accuracy in the determination of @xmath22 and @xmath23 obviously depends on the number of measurement points ; for the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : elev ] , they are respectively of about @xmath24 and @xmath25  min , as data points were collected for several hours before and after @xmath23 , at a rate of four points per hour typically . when the weather is partly cloudy , one sometimes has to stop taking data for a while , and the accuracy in the determination of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is thus not as good .     and @xmath23.,width=283 ]      , with and amplitude of @xmath27 . the solid line is a fit to the simple model discussed in the text.,width=283 ]    by repeating the above measurements typically once per week for a year , the annual variations of @xmath22 and @xmath1 can be obtained .",
    "figure  [ fig : maxelev ] shows the maximal elevation @xmath22 of the sun as a function of time .",
    "one observes a quasi - sinusoidal variation with a period of one year .",
    "the qualitative explanation for this phenomenon is simple , and is usually part of geography courses in elementary education , but i repeat it here for completeness . due to the obliquity @xmath2 of the earth rotation axis , the angle between the earth axis and the line joining the center of the earth to the sun varies between @xmath28 ( at the summer solstice , when the earth axis leans towards the sun ) and @xmath29 ( at the winter solstice ) .",
    "correspondingly , the angular distance between the sun and the celestial pole varies with a period of one year , and an amplitude of @xmath2 .",
    "this induces a similar variation of @xmath22 , around a mean value which depends on the observer s latitude . for a quantitative treatment ,",
    "the reader is referred to  [ sec : theormaxelev ] .",
    "we now turn to a more subtle measurement concerning the variation of @xmath23 , which defines the true local noon .",
    "it is convenient to convert the measured values into a quantity called the _ equation of time _",
    ", that we shall denote by @xmath30 , defined as the difference between the mean local noon and the true local noon ( our measured @xmath1 ) . the former is obtained from the legal noon , given by clocks ( corrected if necessary by one hour in summer due to daylight saving time ) by adding ( subtracting ) four minutes for each degree of longitude west ( east ) from the reference meridian of the corresponding time zone .",
    "for instance , in toulouse ( longitude @xmath17  e ) , one needs to subtract @xmath1 from 13.00  h in winter time and 14.00  h in summer time , and then subtract another 5.8  min to correct for the longitude , to obtain the equation of time @xmath30 .",
    "for instance , on october 17th ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : elev ] ) , we have @xmath31  h , thus giving @xmath32  min .",
    "figure  [ fig : eot ] gives the results obtained by measuring @xmath3 over a year .",
    "one observes a non - trivial behavior , the equation of time varying between a maximum of about 16  min in autumn and a minimum of about @xmath33  min in winter , and vanishing at four different dates .",
    "physically , the origin of the equation of time lies in the fact that the duration of the true solar day , i.e. the time elapsed between two successive transits of the sun across the observer s meridian , is not constant over a year .",
    "the solar day would have a constant duration if , along the year , the sun moved on the celestial sphere ( i ) at constant angular velocity , and ( ii ) along the celestial equator ( this defines the so - called _ mean sun _ ; the time between two transits of the mean sun defines the mean solar day of 86,400  s ) .",
    "however , these two assumptions are both wrong : since the sun moves along the ecliptic , which is inclined with respect to the equator due to the obliquity @xmath2 of the earth axis , the motion of its projection on the equator is irregular ( it coincides with the mean sun at the time of the equinox , then lags behind the mean sun for a quarter of the year , catches up at the solstice , and then is ahead of the mean sun for another three months ) .",
    "this contribution @xmath34 to the equation of time thus has a 6-month period .",
    "moreover , via kepler s second law of areal velocity ( see [ sec : theoreot ] ) the angular velocity of the apparent motion of the sun is not constant over the year , due to the fact that the earth orbit is not circular : for instance , when the earth ",
    "sun distance is smaller ( in january ) , the sun moves faster along the ecliptic .",
    "this contribution @xmath35 to @xmath3 has obviously a one - year period . combining these two contributions",
    "explains the temporal variation of the equation of time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eot]b ; [ sec : theoreot ] gives the derivation of the analytical expressions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "( points with error bars ) .",
    "the solid line is a fit to the simple model of the equation of time given in the appendix .",
    "( b ) combining the effect of the earth obliquity ( @xmath36 , dotted line ) and of the eccentricity of the earth orbit ( @xmath37 , dashed line ) gives the full expression of the equation of time @xmath3 ( solid line).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] ( points with error bars ) .",

    "it is easy to show ( see [ sec : theormaxelev ] ) that to a very good approximation , one has : @xmath38 where @xmath26 is the latitude of the place of observation , @xmath2 the obliquity of the earth axis , @xmath39 the duration of the year , and @xmath40 the date of the vernal equinox . when fitting the data by equation  ( [ eq : hmax ] ) with the four previous quantities as adjustable parameters , we obtain @xmath41 which is close to the accepted values ( respectively , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44  d , and march 20@xmath45 . )",
    "note that by repeating the measurements over the course of several years , a much more accurate determination of the duration @xmath39 of the year could be achieved .",
    "we show in [ sec : theoreot ] that a good approximation of the equation of time is given by : @xmath46 \\label{eq : eot}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the duration of a day ( i.e. 1440 minutes ) , @xmath4 the eccentricity of the earth orbit , and @xmath48 the date of perihelion passage .    fitting the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eot ] by equation  ( [ eq : eot ] ) with @xmath4 and @xmath48 as adjustable parameters ( and using the values determined above for @xmath2 and @xmath39 ) , we obtain @xmath49 again in relatively good agreement with the values @xmath50 and @xmath51  d found in the literature .",
    "i have shown that with very modest equipment , one can measure with reasonable accuracy some of the orbital elements of the earth , and in particular its eccentricity , despite its relatively small value .",
    "the above measurements can be the basis of further activities for students . among them , one can list the following ones , given here under the form of exercises :    * use eq .",
    "( [ eq : elev ] ) of appendix  [ sec : theorelev ] to calculate the length of daytime as a function of the latitude along the year and compare it to the one obtained from the ephemerides given in calendars . * show that the duration of a solar day is @xmath52  s. what are its minimal and maximal values ? * using a sundial with a fixed base , check experimentally that the azimuthal position of the sun when reaches its highest elevation is always the same ( i.e. , south ) throughout the year  @xcite . *",
    "still with a fixed - base sundial , plot experimentally the curve traced out over the year by the end of the shadow at the _ mean _ local noon .",
    "this eight - shaped curve is called an _",
    "analema _ and is sometimes encountered on sundials in order to allow for a computation of the legal time from the measured solar time .",

    "the position of celestial bodies can be specified in spherical coordinates by two angles , once a reference system has been chosen .",
    "two reference systems are particularly useful : the _ horizon system _ , in which measurements are made in practice , and which is dependent on the observer s location on earth , and the _ equatorial system _ , which is defined by the directions of `` fixed '' stars .    * in the horizon system ( fig .",

    "we can thus expect that by calculating separately the small contributions @xmath34 and @xmath35 of both the obliquity and of the eccentricity , and adding them , a good approximation of @xmath30 is obtained : one basically expands @xmath30 to the lowest orders in @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "we first calculate the contribution @xmath34 to @xmath30 arising from the nonzero value of the obliquity . here",
    ", we can neglect the ellipticity of the earth orbit , and assume that the motion of the sun around the earth takes place on a circle , and thus , using kepler s second law , at a constant angular velocity . the longitude @xmath69 of the sun along the ecliptic ( see fig .  [",
