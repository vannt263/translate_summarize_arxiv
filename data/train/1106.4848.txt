    "in equilibrium thermodynamics there is a one - to - one relation between the energy of a macroscopic system , which is not at a phase transition , and its temperature .",
    "the role of the temperature is to control the transfer of energy between the system and other systems thermally coupled to it .",
    "thermal ( heat ) reservoirs are assumed to have infinite energy and are characterized only by their temperature .",
    "a finite system in thermal contact with a thermal reservoir will attain the temperature of the reservoir , which is a device designed to bring a body to a well defined temperature .",
    "if we know the energy @xmath0 of a thermodynamic system @xmath1 in equilibrium , we can adopt two perspectives :    1 .",
    "@xmath1 plays the role of a thermometer and can be used to determine the temperature , @xmath2 , of a thermal reservoir @xmath3 with which the system is , or had been , in contact .",
    "2 .   @xmath1 performs the role of a thermal reservoir and can be used to assign the same temperature @xmath2 to all its subsystems .",
    "we may assume that @xmath1 has been brought into contact with an appropriate reservoir to acquire the given @xmath0 and @xmath4 and then isolated , thus keeping its subsystems in equilibrium at the temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the microscopic aspects of statistical mechanics alters these perspectives by introducing fluctuations of physical quantities in equilibrium so that a finite system in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath4 does not have a well defined energy , but a well definite distribution of energy , @xmath5 , and a well defined average energy , @xmath6 .",
    "the temperature of the reservoir becomes the parameter that controls the distribution of the energy of the finite system .",
    "energy fluctuations are practically unobservable for macroscopic bodies .",
    "however , if systems of all sizes are considered , there is a conceptual problem with respect to these perspectives . if contact with the reservoir at temperature @xmath4 does not guarantee a unique energy of a system , but can determine only a distribution of energies for system , then if the isolated system @xmath1 has a given energy , how can we be sure that @xmath1 was in contact with reservoir @xmath3 and not with reservoir @xmath7 , with @xmath8 ?",
    "to what extent can we assume that @xmath1 and its subsystems are in equilibrium at temperature @xmath4 and not at temperature @xmath9 ?",
    "in statistical mechanics the ( almost ) one - to - one relation between @xmath0 and @xmath4 is recovered for macroscopic bodies , because of the relative smallness of the energy fluctuations . however , the problem of assigning a temperature to a given energy is relevant for non - macroscopic bodies .",
    "our understanding of temperature fluctuations has a long history .",
    "einstein showed that the statistical properties of macroscopic variables can be determined in terms of quantities determined in thermodynamic equilibrium . in sec .",
    "[ review ] we review the basic concepts of the einstein approach . temperature fluctuations have a special status in fluctuation theory .",
    "the einstein theory yields formal expressions for @xmath10 .",
    "some authors suggest that temperature and energy are complementary , similar to position and momentum in quantum mechanics.@xcite in contrast , others have stressed the contradictory nature of the concept of temperature fluctuations@xcite : in the canonical ensemble , which describes contact with a thermal reservoir , the temperature is a parameter , so it can not fluctuate . for a discussion of temperature fluctuations see refs .  .",
    "mandelbrot has shown that the problem of assigning the temperature of the thermal reservoir , to which a system had been in thermal contact , can receive a satisfactory answer within the framework of estimation theory.@xcite this analysis shows that as a system becomes smaller , the second perspective gradually loses its meaning ( a small system can not be considered as a thermal reservoir ) , and the first perspective maintains its validity , because a small system can be used as a thermometer by repeating the measurement of its energy a suitable number of times .",
    "in the usual course on statistical physics the theory of fluctuations is explained using the energy or number of particles .",
    "students might gain the impression that the same approach can be applied to other quantities such as the temperature . this issue is controversial , because temperature is usually a parameter and not a fluctuating quantity . with the advent of small systems such as nanosystems and biomolecules ,",
    "a fluctuating temperature is often discussed in research .",
    "our paper is an effort to explain the possible pitfalls of generalizing fluctuation theory to the wrong quantities , as well as to illustrate a meaningful way of introducing temperature fluctuations .",
    "we first briefly review the contribution by mandelbrot to understanding temperature fluctuations.@xcite we will also discuss a model thermometer , which allows for a detailed understanding of the problem .",
    "we will see that , even in a system with few degrees of freedom , the temperature due to contact with a thermal reservoir is a well defined quantity that can be determined to arbitrary accuracy if a enough measurements are made .",
    "however , the observation time must be much longer than the decorrelation time of the underlying dynamics so that the number of independent measurements is sufficient .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ review ] we review the einstein theory of fluctuations and discuss the origin of the problem .",
    "section  [ mathstat ] is devoted to a discussion on the relation between statistics and fluctuations ( uncertainty ) of the temperature . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we present a model for a thermometer and illustrate a practical way to determine the temperature .",
    "in such a model , as well as for any thermometer , we have an indirect measurement of @xmath4 , which is a statistical estimator , obtained by successive measurements of an observable .",
    "for consistency we briefly recall the einstein theory of fluctuations,@xcite focusing on the issue of temperature fluctuations .",
    "assume that the macroscopic state of a system is described by @xmath11 variables , @xmath12 , which depend on the microscopic state @xmath13 : @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "denote by @xmath16 the parameters that determine the probability distribution function of the microscopic state @xmath13 .",
    "for example , in the canonical ensemble @xmath17 and in the microcanonical ensemble @xmath18 .",
    "the probability distribution function of @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the probability distribution function of @xmath13 in the ensemble with parameters @xmath16 .",

    "the matrix @xmath40 must be positive ( that is , all its eigenvalues must be strictly positive ) , which means that the difference of the entropy with respect to equilibrium must be negative .",

    "( [ prob-2 ] ) or ( [ eq-4 ] ) , we obtain @xmath46 equation  ( [ eq-6 ] ) is correct if we consider @xmath30 as a state function .",

    "( [ prob-2 ] ) with @xmath43 related to the probability distribution function of fluctuating quantities , and hence the derivation of eq .",

    "( [ eq-6 ] ) @xmath47 .    for a system",
    "whose energy fluctuates about the value @xmath48 ( such that @xmath49 , where @xmath4 is the temperature of the thermal reservoir ) we can think of @xmath50 as the temperature @xmath51 of this system , if it has been found with energy @xmath52 .",
    "however , we can also think of @xmath53 as the best guess for @xmath4 if the energy @xmath54 has been measured .",
    "it is tempting to say that because temperature is proportional to the mean kinetic energy , its fluctuations are proportional to fluctuations of the kinetic energy .",
    "this pointis a delicate one , which will be considered in sec .",

[ uncert ] ) .",
    "other authors , such as kittel,@xcite claim that the concept of temperature fluctuations is misleading .",
    "the argument is simple : temperature is just a parameter of the canonical ensemble , which describes the statistics of the system , and therefore it is fixed by definition .",
    "some authors wonder about the meaning of the concept of temperature in small systems.@xcite for instance , feshbach@xcite considered that for an isolated nucleus consisting of @xmath57 nucleons ( neutrons and protons ) , we expect from eq .",
    "( [ eq-7 ] ) a non - negligible value of @xmath58 . however , from experimental data we observe ( in feshbach s words ) that the empirical parameter to be identified with @xmath56 `` does not have such a large uncertainty . ''",
    "mcfee@xcite wrote that `` the average temperature of a small system of constant specific heat connected to a thermal reservoir turns out to be different from that of the reservoir , '' and considered the fluctuations of @xmath59 . because such a quantity is a function of energy , its fluctuations",
    "are well defined and can be studied .",
    "he found @xmath60 which is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq-8 ] ) .",
    "in this section we illustrate the approach of mandelbrot  @xcite to statistical mechanics and review some basic concepts of statistics .      a thermal reservoir is a system with very large ( practically infinite ) energy , such that a system with finite energy which is put in thermal contact with the reservoir comes to equilibrium at the temperature @xmath4 of the reservoir . in thermodynamics",
    "we consider only macroscopic bodies , which are those that have a well defined macroscopic energy by being in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir . even in a purely phenomenological context",
    "we can discuss the fluctuations of the energy of a generic system in thermal equilibrium.@xcite however in statistical mechanics we can also consider systems with a few degrees of freedom , and therefore the fluctuations of the energy can be significant .",
    "the distribution of the energy @xmath54 of a system that is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir of temperature @xmath4 is given by the boltzmann - gibbs density function @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the density of states and @xmath63 is the partition function .",
    "when a system is in equilibrium with an thermal reservoir , we have two mutually exclusive situations : either we know the temperature of the reservoir and can describe the energy distribution of the system ; or we do not know the temperature of the reservoir , and can determine it from the energy distribution of the system .",
    "the latter situation is called the inverse problem . for the inverse problem we can use the tools of estimation theory , which makes it possible to use the available data ( in this case a series of energy values ) to evaluate an unknown parameter ( in this case @xmath4 ) .",
    "if we assume that the equilibrium properties of an isolated system , whether it has been isolated from a thermal reservoir or not , are described by the microcanonical probability density , an answer to the inverse problem is also an answer to the question : is it possible to assign a temperature to an isolated system with a given energy ?",
    "the origin and the importance of the question resides in the following considerations . for an isolated system composed of @xmath64 non - interacting subsystems",
    ", we can calculate average values of observables by means of the probability density @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the energy of subsystem @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the energy of the system , and @xmath69 is the energy density of a single subsystem , so that @xmath70 such calculations are usually very difficult .",
    "however , for systems with a large number of subsystems@xcite we can approximate the probability density by a product of factors from the canonical ensemble : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the temperature associated with the variable @xmath54 .",
    "we have replaced non - independent variables by independent ones and have replaced @xmath54 , the energy of the isolated system ( and the parameter of the original distribution ) , by the common temperature ( and the parameter of the approximate distributions ) of its subsystems in thermal equilibrium .",
    "note that this question must be posed in statistical mechanics , while in thermodynamics the functional relation between energy and temperature is an equation of state and does not call for a microscopic explanation .",
    "we recall here a few basic concepts from estimation theory.@xcite consider a probability density function @xmath73 of the variable @xmath74 , which depends on the parameter @xmath56 , together with a sample of @xmath11 independent events @xmath75 , governed by the probability density @xmath76 , so that the probability density of the sample is @xmath77 we would like to estimate the unknown parameter @xmath56 from the values @xmath78 . for this purpose",
    "we have to define a suitable function of @xmath11 variables , @xmath79 , to obtain the estimate of @xmath56 from the available information .",
    "the quantity @xmath80 is , by construction , a random variable .",
    "we can calculate , for instance , its expected value and its variance .",
    "we assume that @xmath80 is an unbiased estimate of @xmath56 , that is , @xmath81 .",
    "it is clear that the usefulness of an estimating function is tightly linked to its variance .",
    "once the function @xmath82 has been introduced , each sample @xmath83 can also be specified by giving the value of @xmath80 for the particular sample and the values of @xmath84 other variables @xmath85 that are necessary to specify the point on a surface of constant @xmath80 .",
    "in other words , a change of variables @xmath86 can be made , so that the probability of a sample may be written as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the density of the variable @xmath80 ( depending on @xmath56 ) and @xmath89 is the density of the variables @xmath90 , conditioned by the value of @xmath80 and , in general , depending on the parameter @xmath56 .",
    "given certain general conditions of regularity , we can obtain the cramr - rao inequality@xcite for unbiased estimators : @xmath91 where the denominator on the - right hand side of eq .",
    "is known as the fisher information,@xcite which gives a measure of the maximum amount of information we can extract from the data about the parameter to be estimated .",
    "this inequality puts a limit on the ability of making estimates , and also suggests that the estimator should be chosen by minimizing the inequality .",
    "when the variance of @xmath80 is the theoretical minimum , the result @xmath80 is an `` efficient estimate.''@xcite we have followed the convention of distinguishing between an efficient estimate , which has minimum variance for finite @xmath11 , and an asymptotically efficient estimate , which has minimum variance in the limit @xmath92 .    starting from the probability of a given sample , eq .",

    "this behavior is more general : we can demonstrate that for certain regularity conditions , these two estimators are asymptotically equivalent.@xcite    an important point of the preceding discussion is that , due to the exponential form of the canonical ensemble probability density , all of the information about @xmath56 is contained in the total energy of an isolated sample .",

    "it is straightforward to see that the velocity is gaussian distributed , with variance @xmath205 , and only the mass of the piston is needed for the estimate .",
    "the choice of which estimator is more suitable is a matter of convenience .    for systems exhibiting",
    "aging and ergodicity breaking there are model thermometers that are very different from the one proposed here and are based on the linear response of the system and its comparison with unperturbed correlators.@xcite in this case we may have access to `` effective '' temperatures related to slow , non - equilibrated , degrees of freedom , and the problem of uncertainty becomes more complicated , because the effective temperatures may be time - dependent.@xcite",
    "we have considered the concept of temperature fluctuations and showed that it makes sense only when associated with uncertainties of measurement . in a molecular dynamics computation at fixed energy",
    "it is common practice to look at the fluctuations of the kinetic energy .",
    "because the mean value of the kinetic energy per particle , @xmath206 , is proportional to the temperature , it might be concluded that the fluctuations of @xmath206 are related to the fluctuations of the temperature , @xmath207 .",
    "however , it is the random variable @xmath206 that fluctuates from sample to sample , not its mean value .",
    "hence , in the preceding relation we should properly write @xmath208 instead of @xmath209 , because we are using the random variable @xmath206 as an estimator of the temperature , which as stressed by kittel@xcite , is an unknown but fixed parameter .",

    "in contrast , if @xmath64 is small , a single measurement can lead to a large uncertainty in the estimate of temperature , but the uncertainty can be arbitrarily reduced by increasing the number of measurements . the small system can be used as a thermometer , in this case the dynamics plays a non - negligible role , and the characteristic decorrelation time of the relevant variables dictates the effective number of independent measurements .    for systems with a few degrees of freedom the uncertainty in the temperature can be reduced by an adequate amount of data , which is an answer to the problem concerning @xmath56 pointed out by feshbach in ref .  .",
