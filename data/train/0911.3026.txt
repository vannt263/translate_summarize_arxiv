    "one of the most striking observations in high energy multihadron production is that both species abundances and transverse momentum spectra ( provided effects of collective flow and gluon radiation are removed ) follow the thermal pattern of an ideal hadron - resonance gas , with a universal temperature @xmath0 mev @xcite .",
    "this behavior was initially attributed to a temperature limit arising from an exponentially growing resonance spectrum @xcite and is today generally taken as a reflection of the quark - hadron transition temperature in qcd @xcite .",
    "thermal multihadron production has been investigated experimentally in a variety of collision processes , from annihilation and -collisions to high energy nucleus - nucleus interactions . for sufficiently high energies ,",
    "these studies all led to the same universal hadronic resonance gas temperature , even though there were other distinguishing features .",
    "in particular , it was observed that in elementary collisions , strangeness production suffered an overall suppression , quite likely due to the heavier mass of the strange quark . in nuclear interaction , this suppression is less or perhaps completely absent .",
    "the origin of the success of a thermal picture for such a variety of different collision configurations has been an enigma for a long time , extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "in particular , given a large number of possible multi - hadron channels , why does nature always choose to maximize entropy at a universal temperature within a finite region ?",
    "in heavy ion collisions , it is conceivable that this could have something to do with the relatively large volume , which makes the system confined for a long enough time to allow sufficient inelastic scattering to reach equilibration .",
    "however , this can not account for the observation of thermal behaviour in elementary collisions , where such a mechanism can not play any role ; also , a hadronic - rescattering thermalization is hardly reconciled with the observation of a centrality - independent chemical freeze - out temperature in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "these facts are a strong indication that the thermal behaviour is a feature of hadronization itself .",
    "one explanation proposed for a universal spontaneous thermal hadron emission is that it arises through quantum tunnelling ( unruh radiation ) at the color event horizon @xcite ; the schwinger mechanism @xcite is a special case of such unruh radiation @xcite . among other ideas put forward to explain the mechanism of the apparent thermalization , it is worth mentioning quantum chaos and berry s conjecture @xcite , still at a speculative stage .    in some recent studies @xcite ,",
    "the extent of agreement of data with a thermal description was discussed for different processes . in a `` thermalization '' framework where inelastic collisions play a major role ,",
    "it is suggestive that elementary processes should not lead to as good an agreement to the same , though approximated , statistical model formula , as it is found for nuclear collisions , with a sort of hierarchy from to  .",
    "such a view would be supported if it was found that the agreement , as specified by e.g. , is simply much better for data than it is for that from annihilation .",
    "this has in fact been claimed @xcite ; however , if such comparisons are to be conclusive , several conditions have to be met .",
    "* first of all , any comparison should be based on essentially the same set of species .",
    "ideally , these should be narrow and hence long - lived resonance states , in order to avoid the difficulties encountered in determining the rates of broad short - lived states , concerning background separation , feed - down and branching ratios .",
    "this requirement leaves in general some 10 to 15 states and so still allows a significant comparative analysis . * next , if the comparison is to be based on the @xmath1 for the fits to be considered , the corresponding data sets should have similar experimental errors .",
    "if the estimated theoretical values are approximations , a more accurate data set may imply larger deviations between model and data in units of errors , so that a comparison of the   of two different sets makes sense only if their errors are comparable .",
    "* finally , the basic idea of statistical hadronization can be implemented for specific process in different ways . without decisive further information ,",
    "a comparison of the quality of the fits remains the only tool to judge which scheme is closest to reality .",
    "we have here emphasized the use of  as a tool to _ compare _ different experimental configurations as well as different model implementations .",
    "the reason for this is , as we shall discuss in more detail in section iii , that the absolute value of  has to be interpreted with much care .",
    "since the theoretical formulae employed in any statistical model fit are only approximations of the full dynamics , deviations must appear , as has been mentioned , once the measurements become sufficiently precise , and hence  must then become large .",
    "this point was already made about 10 years ago @xcite , when discussing the effect of local fluctuations of thermodynamical parameters .    with these caveats in mind ,",
    "we have selected three extensive data sets for our comparative analysis . in section ii , following a short summary defining the details of the underlying statistical model framework , we compare recent hadroproduction data from collisions , taken by the star experiment at rhic for @xmath2 gev @xcite , to the corresponding results from collisions @xcite at the same energy and measured by the same experimental group .",
    "one very remarkable result of this analysis is , as we shall see , that the fit to the data is as good as it can possibly be , with a  @xmath3 ; the corresponding analysis leads to a less optimal fit . to elucidate the meaning of this result",
    ", we discuss in section iii more generally the relevant features of comparing the statistical hadronization model to data and testing the fits obtained . in section iv",
    ", we then consider data from lep at 91.25 gev @xcite and compare the fits for this to the results . in section",
    "v , we consider more generally tests of the different implementations of the statistical model ; in this context , we also consider possible origins of recent apparently contradictory conclusions @xcite on the thermal description of data .",
    "in this section we perform a statistical analysis of hadroproduction data at @xmath4 gev at rhic with and as initial collision configurations . the data in both cases are centre - of - mass midrapidity densities from the same experiment @xcite . for collisions , there are 18 species of measured secondaries @xcite , including several short - lived strange meson and hyperon resonant states ; for interactions , we use a set of 12 rapidity densities of long - lived states at midrapidities @xcite , already studied in ref .",

    ". a naive conclusion of this comparison could then be that the statistical model leads to a better agreement with collisions than for @xmath43 .",
    "can we conclude that @xmath41 collisions provide a `` more thermal '' configuration than heavy ion collisions ? before answering this question , a general discussion about the statistical model formulae and",
    "the meaning of statistical tests is now appropriate .",
    "here we want to discuss more in detail two points that have been mentioned in the introduction , namely the meaning of a  fit given only an approximate theoretical description , and how one can compare two fits to such an incomplete input .",
    "in general , the test of a physical model is usually based on a fit of data and a statistical test of this fit .",
    "thus a @xmath44 test tells us how likely it would be to obtain a value larger than the minimum @xmath44 of our fit , provided that the hypothesis , i. e. , the model , is correct . most often , however , the theoretical formulae that we take as hypotheses are only an approximate representation of the underlying model or theory . in other words , they can be expected to reproduce the data only up to some reasonably small deviation .",
    "there are many instances of this situation ; a simple example is the lowest - order perturbative expansion of a differential cross section in high - energy collisions .",
    "if measurements are more accurate than the estimated deviation , the @xmath44 statistical test will obviously fail , indicating that corrections to the lowest - order theoretical formula are necessary .",
    "sometimes the theoretical description of the process is fully under control and corrections are relatively easy to calculate ( as for electroweak processes in collisions ) , sometimes they are not .",
    "this latter is the case in this work , where we test the statistical hadronization model .",
    "the basic premise of the statistical model is that high energy collisions lead to the formation of multiple clusters , emitted sequentially in rapidity and decaying into hadrons according to their relative phase space weights .",
    "the formulae ( [ form ] ) and ( [ formh ] ) are specific implementations of this idea , based on further additional assumptions besides the basic postulate of the model . in elementary collisions",
    ", it is assumed that the probability of distributing the conserved charges among the actually produced clusters has a special form : for instance , a statistical distribution of charges among the clusters , leading to the equivalence with one global cluster ( this is assumed in our work here ) . but other charge distribution schemes are obviously conceivable , see ref .",
    "@xcite , and we shall return to this aspect in section v. it is therefore clear that if experimental multiplicities were known to a very good accuracy , discrepancies with the predictions or fitted values of formula ( [ form ] ) could show up , even if the basic idea of purely statistical decays of clusters / fireballs remains true .",
    "one would then have to correct ( [ form ] ) for effects of a non - statistical distribution of charges among the clusters , etc .",
    "unfortunately , the definition of such corrections requires a more complete picture of the production process than we presently have .",
    "of course , this does not mean that approximate models can not be disproved .",
    "it only means that , as long as corrections to the leading - order formula are not available , we have to be content with a statement like `` the statistical hadronization model in its simplest approximation reproduces the data up to 10% '' , and we should take deviations from formula ( [ form ] ) with great care .    above and beyond these model - dependent details",
    ", we should also stress that any analytical multiplicity formulae , such as ( [ form ] ) and ( [ formh ] ) or variations thereof , provide by construction only an approximate description .",
    "the use of these formulae will necessarily lead to deviations for sufficiently precise measurements .",
    "to illustrate this situation , which is ubiquitous in physics , we recall a familiar example .",
    "the spectrum of the sunlight measured at the top of the atmosphere is usually fitted to a black body formula , yielding a temperature of about 5780@xmath45k .",
    "the formula is accurate to about 10% , but the fit quality is extremely bad , with a huge @xmath44 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the reason for such discrepancy is that on a microscopic level , stars are not perfect radiators ; different effects , such as the absorption of light by atoms and/or ions blocking part the outward radiation path , surface non - uniformities , etc .",
    ", all cause deviations from the simple black - body spectrum , and these are revealed when the accuracy of the photometric measurement is better than about 10% .",
    "the effects responsible for these deviations are difficult to embody in an analytical formula and can only be studied numerically .",
    "still , the failure of the lowest - order planck formula fit in passing a rigorous statistical @xmath44 test has not led anyone to the conclusion that the surface of the sun is not a thermal system .",
    "in addition to such theoretical caveats , one must also bear in mind the role of experimental complications .",
    "in fact , most of the measurements which are used to perform a fit include hidden correlations which are difficult to assess ( e.g. , multiplicities of particles measured with the same detector ) .",
    "therefore the usual assumption of independent errors entering in the @xmath44 , which we have retained here throughout , is only an approximation , and the actual absolute value of the best  could well be different .",
    "hence , for theoretical as well as for experimental reasons , the use of absolute  values to judge the quality of statistical model descriptions , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , appears to us as not really permissible .",
    "but even with these caveats in mind , a comparative assessment of fit results in different collision configurations is still possible . to be specific ,",
    "if the fit quality to a given formula was better in collisions than in or interactions under the same conditions , this could of course mean that the deviations observed in and stem from a genuine failure of the model for this case , rather than from the approximate nature of the employed formula .",
    "however , for such a comparison to make any sense , it must fulfill the essential prerequisite noted in the introduction . thus ,",
    "if the comparison is to be based on a @xmath44 test for the fits to be considered , the corresponding data sets must have comparable average experimental errors .",
    "it is quite clear that if data sets with largely different accuracy are used , a comparison of  values could be misleading .",
    "to illustrate : if the data set @xmath33 ( example : hadronic multiplicities in ) with an average accuracy of 10% yields a fit with  = 1 and the set @xmath46 ( example : hadronic rapidity densities in heavy ion collisions ) with an average accuracy of @xmath47 yields a fit with  = 3 , a blind comparison of @xmath44 s would lead us to the erroneous conclusion that the model can be used to describe @xmath33 , but not @xmath46 .",
    "we now return to our comparison of sect .  2 and the hypothetical conclusion that the statistical model works better in collisions than in collisions .",
    "a comparison of @xmath44 values requires that measurements have the same experimental accuracy , but this is not the case here : as can be deduced from table  [ fitpp1 ] , the relative experimental errors for the same species sets differ , with an average value of about 18% for the data but only 10% for .    a possible way of comparing the quality of the two fits would be to look at the average relative deviation between theoretical and experimental values . for each particle species this",
    "is shown in the last column of table  [ fitpp1 ] . indeed , the average deviation of the 12 common species are very similar : 12.5% in pp and 11.7% in au - au .",
    "this result is a strong indication that the statistical model indeed yields the same quality of agreement in the examined cases . to illustrate this",
    "more precisely , we have made new fits with the experimental errors rescaled such that the relative errors of the measurements are exactly equal and determined by the largest error for each species .",
    "for instance , the @xmath8 multiplicity in collisions is now assigned an error equal to its relative error in heavy ion collisions times its multiplicity in collisions , that is @xmath48 , giving it the same relative error as the corresponding measurement in collisions .",
    "conversely , for the @xmath49 in collisions , the measurement is far more accurate than that in pp collisions ; hence here a larger error is assigned to the heavy ion value in the same manner .",
    "this procedure artificially enhances the experimental errors in both samples and can thus be used only for illustrative purposes , neither to extract the best estimate of the model parameters , nor to make a proper statistical test .",
    "the results of these fits are shown in table  [ fitpp2 ] ( third block ) , and they show that the  in is now slightly better than in collisions at the same energy .",
    "this reinforces our first assessment that the simple statistical model formulae ( [ form2 ] ) and ( [ formh ] ) agree with the data up to @xmath50 both in and collisions and that none of the examined systems can be claimed to be  more thermal \" in this respect .",
    "here we focus our attention on the largest and the most accurate sample , data from lep at @xmath52 gev ; this we compare again to the heavy ion sample from rhic at @xmath53 gev , and we again choose as common as possible a set of long - lived particles .",
    "since in collisions , the multiplicities of particle and antiparticle are obviously equal , we now find only 7 common species ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath13 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) .",
    "therefore we have retained all 12 rhic measurements ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath56 , @xmath17 ) and added to the data sample @xmath58 , @xmath18 , and the three long - lived @xmath59 states .",
    "the experimental values used for this comparison are a weighted average of the full phase space multiplicities measured by the four lep experiments ; these were also used in our previous analysis@xcite .",
    "the resulting fit is to be compared to the mid - rapidity densities measured by star @xcite and already used above . for comparison purposes ,",
