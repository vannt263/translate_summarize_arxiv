    "in a novel experiment van wees _ et al _ @xcite and wharam _ et al _ @xcite found that the conductance of a nano - meter scale constriction between two 2d electron gas increases monotonically in steps of 2@xmath1 as more and more propagating sub - bands become available .",
    "such a constriction is referred to as a quantum point contact ( qpc ) .",
    "this quantization of conductance is due to the lateral quantization of the energy ( due to the formation of sub - bands ) and sheds light on the physical relevance of landauer s formula @xcite .",
    "transport along the wire with such quantized states become reflection - less due to the absence of backscattering and then the conductance quantization is simply evident from the landauer conductance formula .",
    "energy can also be quantized by applying a large magnetic field .",
    "in such a situation the four probe hall conductance is found to be quantized and the phenomenon is well known as the integral quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) @xcite . whereas in iqhe the quantization has been observed to an accuracy of one part in billion , the accuracy in the qpc experiments is one part in hundred .",
    "this departure was therefore taken very seriously . since",
    "then the conductance of qpc has been studied in great details , experimentally as well as theoretically .",
    "various aspects like the role of point defects in the point contact ( pc ) @xcite , the role of evanescent modes in the pc @xcite , mode matching at the junction of the contact and the reservoir @xcite , adiabatic as well as non - adiabatic shape changes of the point contact @xcite , non - uniformity of potential in th pc @xcite , bound states in the presence of non - adiabatic shape changes @xcite , periodic modulations in the point contact @xcite , magnetic field in the pc @xcite , etc . have been studied in details .",
    "non - adiabatic constrictions in the point contact roughly maintain the quantization @xcite , but if there is a single non - adiabatic cavity in the point contact then this quantization is completely washed away @xcite .",
    "recently leng and lent @xcite have shown that the quantization of the conductance is recovered if a large number of non - adiabatic constrictions are taken in the point contact periodically , however , the conductance does not increase monotonically with the energy .",
    "it was analyzed by leng and lent @xcite that back scattering can be suppressed in these periodically modulated channels ( except in the narrow regions between resonances which can not be avoided in a finite periodic system ) because the periodicity results in bloch state like good quantum states and thus resulting in a perfect conductance quantization . however , the periodic system has to be connected to leads on both sides , and due to matching of wave - function between the leads and the periodic system there will be some mixing of the transverse modes ( modes arising due to the finite thickness in the direction perpendicular to the propagating direction ) . in the presence of some channel mixing it is possible that all the resonances in the transmission probabilities are not due to the symmetry of the system but some of them are fano resonances , arising due to the mixing of transverse modes @xcite .",
    "hence , if there are defects or disorder in the system , which will result in the breakdown of the symmetry of the system , it is possible that this may not affect the fano resonances much , although it will obviously affect the resonances arising due to the symmetry .",
    "hence , it may be interesting to see the effect of a defect on the quantized conductance of a periodically modulated channel .",
    "earlier we have reported @xcite the effect of a defect on the conductance of a periodically modulated channel when only one propagating sub - band is populated in the main wire and we showed that the defect has very drastic effects on the conductance which can be used for efficient band - tailoring . in this paper",
    "we study the effect of similar defects on the conductance when two or more sub - bands are occupied .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we outline the numerical technique used . in section iii",
    "we graphically discuss our results . in section iv our conclusions are summarized . and finally section v is devoted to acknowledgments .",
    "fig .  1 shows a single non - adiabatic geometric scatterer in a point contact .",
    "the point contact is bounded between @xmath2 x @xmath3 whereas the scatterer in the point contact is bounded between @xmath4 y @xmath5 .",
    "the width of the scatterer in the @xmath6 direction is @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath8 we refer to the system as a double - stub whereas for @xmath9 we refer to the system as a double - constriction .",
    "the scatterer is symmetric in the @xmath10 direction .",
    "so the sub - bands will have a definite parity and opposite parity states can never mix . by cascading",
    "many such units we can make a periodically modulated qpc or quantum channel .",
    "reservoirs are attached to two ends of the sample .",
    "we do not consider any mode matching at the junctions of the reservoirs . as a result we do not have evanescent modes in the main wire but we do have sufficient number of evanescent modes inside the non - adiabatic scatterer . in a physical situation where the leads connecting the sample to the reservoirs become large",
    ", the effect of this mode matching becomes unimportant @xcite . and",
    "moreover , if we include evanescent modes in the main wire , the system of periodic arrangement of double stubs and the system of periodic arrangement of double - constrictions become similar to each other .",
    "we deliberately make them different to give us some physical insight .",
    "we have evaluated the conductance or the transmission coefficient across the system numerically and the procedure followed is briefly outlined below . the details can be found in ref .",
    "the system is unbounded in the propagating direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath6 direction whereas in the @xmath10 direction the system is bounded due to the finite width .",
    "the hard wall boundary conditions are assumed along the boundaries of the channel and these conditions define the channel modulation . inside the system",
    "we have taken the magnitude of the quantum mechanical potential @xmath11=0 , _ i.e. _ , we are in the classically unbound regime .",
    "we first consider the case of a single scatterer as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the two dimensional schrdinger equation for the system is ( we set @xmath12=2@xmath13=1 )    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the total energy of an electron and @xmath16 is the wave function . in the leads far away from the scatterer",
    "the electron propagates in a perfect narrow wire where eigenstates can be decoupled into a longitudinal plane wave part @xmath17 and a transverse part @xmath18 .",
    "the wave function @xmath18 corresponds to motion between infinite potential walls along the @xmath10 direction is      the scattering states are of the form    @xmath20   \\nonumber + \\sum^\\infty_{n=1 } r_{n\\,m}{e^{-ik_nx } \\over \\surd{k_n } } \\sin[\\frac{n \\pi}{b}(y+b/2)]\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,for ~x \\le -a,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath21 \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , for ~x \\ge a   \\,\\ , , \\ ] ]    where the index @xmath22 runs over all possible transverse modes .",
    "the incident particle is in the @xmath13-@xmath23 mode .",
    "the longitudinal wave vectors are given by    @xmath24    @xmath15 being the total energy .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 is the energy associated with the @xmath22-@xmath23 transverse mode and @xmath26 is the energy associated with the longitudinal motion of an electron in the @xmath22-@xmath23 transverse mode .",
    "the transmission ( @xmath27 ) and reflection ( @xmath28 ) amplitudes are to be determined by matching solutions across @xmath29 and can be expressed in terms of the matrix coefficients    @xmath30    @xmath31    where    @xmath32_{m , m^\\prime } e^{-ik_{m^\\prime}a},\\ ] ]    and    @xmath33_{m , m^\\prime } e^{-ik_{m^\\prime}a}.\\ ] ]    the matrices @xmath34 and @xmath35 are obtained by matching the wave - function outside the scatterer to those inside the scatterer and are given by ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath36    and    @xmath37    where    @xmath38 { \\rm cos}[\\frac{(m - n)\\pi}{2}]}{\\small{m}-\\frac{nb}{c } } -   \\frac{{\\rm sin}[(\\frac{m}{b}+\\frac{n}{c})\\frac{\\pi b}{2 } ]   { \\rm cos}[\\frac{(m+n)\\pi}{2}]}{\\small{m}+\\frac{nb}{c } } ] , \\ ] ]    and @xmath39 is the wave vector along the @xmath6 direction associated with the @xmath40-@xmath23 channel in a double - stub . the sums in eqs.(9 ) and ( 10 ) run over infinite values of @xmath40 .",
    "this is because in the interior region of the scatterer , infinite number of states ( one from each transverse mode ) couple to the electronic state of incident energy @xmath15 .",
    "some of them are propagating modes and some of them are evanescent modes .",
    "the sums in eqs.(9 ) and ( 10 ) are highly converging and one can truncate them appropriately depending on the accuracy required . typically 10 evanescent modes are included in our calculations .",
    "having found the complex transmission and reflection amplitudes across one such scatterer we use the scattering matrix cascading technique to find the transmission across many such scatterers put together in series .",
    "the separation between the two scatterers is @xmath41 and all other lengths @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 associated with the scatterer are the same as in fig .  1 .",
    "for details of the method of cascading we refer to ref .",
    "here we just outline the algorithm .",
    "the scattering matrix ( s ) for any symmetric scatterer is given by    @xmath45    where the @xmath46 and @xmath47 are matrices :    @xmath48    and    @xmath49    for the case of symmetric scatterers considered in our work we have @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "there are @xmath22 incoming channels and @xmath22 outgoing channels .",
    "if two scatterers are characterized by the s matrices @xmath52 and @xmath53 then the resultant scattering matrix , on cascading the two systems , is the direct product of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the total s matrix of n scatterers is the direct product of n scattering matrices .",
    "the order in the direct product of the n s - matrices must be kept the same as that of the spatial order of the scatterers .",
    "this is because the s matrices do not commute .",
    "thus from the total s matrix we can find the two terminal - conductance g , which is given by the landauer formula @xcite _ i.e. _ , g=@xmath54 .",
    "we first consider the system of a quantum channel ( main wire ) in which a series of double - constrictions are arranged periodically .",
    "the system under consideration consists of 87 double - constrictions .",
    "we have taken @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "the distance between two consecutive constrictions is @xmath57 where @xmath42 is the width of the main wire along the @xmath10 direction . here ,",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath44 are the widths of a single constriction along the @xmath6 and @xmath10 direction , respectively .",
    "the dimensionless conductance , g ( @xmath58 ) for this system is plotted in fig .  2 ( dotted curve ) as a function of dimensionless incident energy @xmath59 ( where @xmath60/2 is the half width of the main wire ) .",
    "we vary the incident energy in the range such that two to seven propagating modes in the main wire are occupied .",
    "we find a conductance quantization which is not monotonically increasing but the quantization is not good . at higher energies ,",
    "since there are a lot of propagating modes , there are a lot of nearly degenerate channels and small mode mixing can wash out the quantization . and at lower energies , in the case of such a large value of @xmath7 ( @xmath61=1 ) , there are not many fano resonances in the system to produce a good quantization .",
    "the reason is that the exponentially decaying evanescent modes have a negligible probability density inside the constriction .",
    "a breakdown of the symmetry by the presence of a defect can completely destroy the quantization as demonstrated in fig .  2 ( solid curve ) .",
    "we replace the middle constriction of the original system by a different constriction .",
    "the width of the newly placed constriction ( defect constriction ) is such that @xmath62 .",
    "such a defect in a qpc is a non - adiabatic or a very strong scatterer .",
    "other parameters are the same as for the other constrictions .",
    "2 ( solid curve ) shows the dimensionless conductance ( @xmath63 + 3 ) as a function of the dimensionless incident energy for this system .",
    "the incident energy is varied to excite two to seven modes in the main wire .",
    "we see that the quantization of the conductance is lost except for some of the lowest steps of the few lowest sub - bands .",
    "thus a single defect is enough to destroy the quantization of the conductance of the system .",
    "we can increase the probability density of the modes in the scatterer , _",
    "i.e. , _ by taking a double - stub or a very small double - constriction .",
    "in case of the double - stub there will be more propagating modes in the scatterer and in case of the short double - constriction the evanescent modes in the constriction will have a large probability density . in the following",
    "we demonstrate that in these two cases we get very good quantization and also they are robust even in the presence of the defect .",
    "first we consider a system comprising of a series of identical double - stubs arranged periodically in a point contact .",
    "we take 87 double - stubs .",
    "other parameters for this system are given by @xmath55 and @xmath64 .",
    "the distance between two consecutive double - stubs is @xmath57 . here ,",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath44 are the widths of a single double - stub along the @xmath6 and @xmath10 directions , respectively .",
    "3 ( dotted curve ) shows the dimensionless conductance for this system as a function of dimensionless incident energy . in this case",
    "we see that the quantization is very good .",
    "so , we see that a system consisting of a series of double - stubs in a point contact gives better conductance quantization than that of a series of constrictions .",
    "this is in contrast to the fact that a single double - stub in a qpc destroys quantization more effectively than a single constriction @xcite .",
    "we now put a defect in the system .",
    "the defect is introduced by the replacement of the middle double - stub in the system by another one whose width in the @xmath10 direction , taken to be @xmath65 = 1.205 , is different from the other double - stubs .",
    "we excite up to seven modes in the main wire by a proper choice of the range of incident energy .",
    "the dimensionless conductance ( @xmath63 + 3 ) for this system ( the system with a defect ) is plotted as a function of dimensionless incident energy .",
    "this is shown in fig .  3 ( solid curve ) where we notice that the quantization of the conductance still partly survive and is not destroyed completely .",
    "quantization is still retained up to the 4th or 5th step .",
    "backscattering in some regimes is negligibly small as found by comparing the solid curve with the dotted curve in fig .",
    "3 .    next , in fig .  4 ( dotted curve )",
    "we consider a system that consists of 87 small double - constrictions regularly placed in a main wire .",
    "we have taken @xmath66 ( so it is a small constriction ) , @xmath56 , and the distance between two consecutive constrictions is @xmath57 .",
    "note that the only difference in this case , _",
    "i.e. , _ the value of @xmath43 , is very small compared to the system considered in fig .  2 .",
    "again we restrict ourselves to maximum seven mode propagation . here",
    "we see that the quantization of the conductance is much better than that in fig .  2 .",
    "we have examined the quality of quantization of conductance for systems with various values of @xmath67 and noticed that the quality of the quantization of conductance degrades as the the value of @xmath67 deviates from 0.125 such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 are incommensurate .",
    "now we introduce a defect constriction in the system as just discussed in the above in order to simulate mode mixing and backscattering .",
    "we replace the middle constriction by a defect constriction .",
    "the value of @xmath65 for the defect constriction is 0.905 while the other parameters are the same as for the other constrictions .",
    "the dimensionless conductance ( @xmath63 + 3 ) of the system is plotted as a function of dimensionless incident energy in fig .",
    "4 ( solid curve ) .",
    "two to seven propagating modes are considered .",
    "we notice that the quantization of conductance for the lower bands are fairly retained even in the presence of this defect .",
    "the quantization of conductance in periodic channels is more robust than that in un - modulated point contacts . the experiment of kouwenhoven _",
    "et al _ @xcite measures the conductance of a periodic channel but one has to take a longer chain to see the quantization .",
    "but because of the robustness of the effect it will be worthwhile to do such an experiment in a long channel .",
    "a system of periodic stubs is more robust than that of a system of periodic constrictions .",
    "but if the spacing between the constrictions is made very small , then the quantization of periodic constrictions is equally robust .",
    "the fano resonances , that are always present in a multichannel scattering problem , have a strong influence on the quantization of the conductance .",
