    "we generalize this method for higher dimensions . similarly to the four - dimensional case , the conformally transformed extrinsic curvature is given analytically and the conformal factor should be calculated numerically .",
    "we perform numerical calculation for the conformal factor in the case of the head - on collision of two equal - mass black holes and then determine the location of apparent horizon ( ah ) that encloses two black holes ( the common ah ) .",
    "we clarify the parameter space for common ah formation .",
    "then , the initial data is evolved adopting the close - slow approximation . in this approximation ,",
    "the distance between two black holes and the linear momentum of each black hole are regarded as small parameters compared to the black hole size and the gravitational mass of the system , respectively . in this case",
    ", the system may be considered to be a perturbed single schwarzschild black hole . in the four - dimensional case ,",
    "the results in the close - slow approximation agree with those in the fully nonlinear analysis ( see @xcite and references in @xcite ) , and hence , it is natural to expect that this is also the case in the higher - dimensional case .",
    "we provide a formula for the radiation efficiency ( i.e. , the ratio of the radiated energy to the system energy ) and discuss their dependence on the dimensionality .",

    "the methods used in four dimensions can be applied for higher - dimensional problems and hence , the simulation will be done in the near future . for such future simulations , a method for providing initial condition we present here will be useful .",
    "the second purpose is to approximately evaluate gravitational radiation in the collision of two black holes in the higher - dimensional case .",
    "since we adopt a linear perturbative method , a reliable result is derived only for a small parameter space . however , our result for such parameters will be useful for calibrating fully nonlinear results in the near future",

    "the hamiltonian and momentum constraints are @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the ricci scalar of @xmath5 and @xmath12 is the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath6 . introducing @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 the hamiltonian and momentum constraints",

    "asymptotically behaves as @xmath91 thus , we impose the so - called robin condition , @xmath92 , at the outer boundary . in the cylindrical coordinate , it is rewritten as @xmath93 we put the outer boundary at @xmath94 and solve the equation for @xmath60 using a finite difference method with the grid number @xmath95 .",
    "numerical computation was carried out for the parameter space @xmath96 and @xmath97 with the @xmath98 interval or the 0.01 interval .",
    "there are two sources for numerical error of the conformal factor : one is associated with the finiteness of the grid spacing and the other with the finiteness of the outer boundary location . to evaluate the numerical error by the grid spacing , we took reference data with sufficiently large grid number ( @xmath99 grids ) and evaluated following three characteristic numerical error values : @xmath100 where @xmath2 stands for the label of the grids . changing the grid spacing , we confirm that @xmath101 decreases with improving the grid resolution at second order .",
    "all the three error estimates were found to be small . with our standard choice ,",
    "@xmath102 is @xmath103@xmath104% for @xmath105@xmath106 .",
    "computation was also performed changing the location of the outer boundaries from @xmath94 to @xmath107 and the numerical solution converges with increasing the radius of the outer boundaries . in this case , @xmath108 is found to be relatively large , about 917% for @xmath105@xmath106 .",
    "such large differences occur at outer boundaries and come from the fact that the robin condition is an approximate boundary condition . however , because @xmath60 is small at the outer boundary , the error of the conformal factor @xmath56 is small . in fact",
    ", we found that @xmath102 is about @xmath109 for @xmath105 and becomes smaller as @xmath1 is increased ( less than @xmath110 in the case @xmath111 ) .",
    "the error @xmath101 is smaller than @xmath108 by a factor for @xmath105 and is comparable to @xmath102 for @xmath111 . because @xmath56 is used in the calculations of the adm mass or the ah , the error for these calculations is expected to have the order of @xmath102 .",
    "hence , we consider that sufficient accuracy is obtained in our calculation .",
    "figure  [ contour - adm ] shows the contours of @xmath112 on the @xmath113-plane for @xmath105@xmath106 . the difference between @xmath114 and @xmath75 indicates the strength of nonlinearity due to the right hand side of the hamiltonian constraint  .",
    "we find that the nonlinearity of the system becomes large as @xmath1 is increased for fixed values of @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "a common ah that covers two black holes is searched for introducing the spherical coordinate @xmath117 by @xmath118 and @xmath119 and assuming that the location is denoted by @xmath120 . then the equation for the ah is given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the unit normal to the surface : @xmath123 then , the equation for the ah reduces to an ordinary differential equation for @xmath124 : @xmath125 this equation is solved under the boundary conditions @xmath126 at @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "figure  [ critical - ah ] shows the critical line for the common ah formation .",
    "irrespective of the dimensionality , the common ah is formed if @xmath115 is sufficiently small .",
    "it is interesting to point out that , for @xmath105 , the ah formation is more subject for larger values of @xmath129 while for @xmath130 , the presence of @xmath129 tends to prevent formation of the common ah .",
    "this might seem strange because the kinetic energy is naturally expected to help the ah formation .",
    "in order to obtain a corroboration for this result , we direct attention to the ah ( denoted by @xmath131 ) at the critical separation @xmath132 in the case @xmath133 .",
    "then we add small @xmath134 without changing the value of @xmath135 . because the change in the conformal factor is @xmath136 and",
    "can be ignored , the surface @xmath131 is interpreted as a minimal surface on which @xmath137 holds .",
    "now let us consider the expansion on this minimal surface which is given by @xmath138 .",
    "figure  [ expansion ] shows the behavior of @xmath139 in the four- and six - dimensional cases . in the case",
    "@xmath105 , we find that @xmath140 is negative and thus the minimal surface is a trapped surface .",
    "this guarantees the existence of an ah outside of the minimal surface .",
    "hence the motion helps ah formation in the four - dimensional case . on the other hand , in the case @xmath141",
    ", @xmath140 becomes positive on some part of the minimal surface .",
    "the similar behavior was found for all @xmath142 .",
    "therefore , the minimal surface is not a trapped surface and the motion does not necessarily help the ah formation in the higher - dimensional cases .",
    "we found numerically that the term @xmath143 mainly contributes to the positivity of @xmath140 .",
    "this is because for high @xmath1 , the ah at the critical separation is hourglass shaped in the neighborhood of the equatorial plane and the value of @xmath144 is quite large around @xmath145 .",
    "it enhances the value of @xmath143 which is proportional to @xmath146 .",
    ".the values of @xmath147 evaluated on the ah critical line for @xmath148 .",
    "the unit is % . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ compare - erad ]    table  [ compare - erad ] shows the values of @xmath149 evaluated in this procedure . in the higher - dimensional cases , it is @xmath1503% for @xmath151 and @xmath152 for @xmath153 .",
    "these values do not depend significantly on @xmath1 in the higher - dimensional cases .",
    "note that the values in table  [ compare - erad ] does not contradict the bounds derived from the ah area shown in table  [ lower - bound ] .",
    "the difference between @xmath75 and @xmath114 increases with increase of @xmath116 ( cf .",
    "[ contour - adm ] ) .",
    "this difference comes from time asymmetry of the initial data and has the magnitude of order @xmath154 .",
    "thus for a large difference with @xmath155 , the linear approximation breaks down . in the four - dimensional case , we know that the nonlinear effect suppresses @xmath156  @xcite .",
    "if this is also the case for @xmath157 , the value of @xmath158 for @xmath116 would be an overestimate and would indicate that gravitational radiation do not significantly contribute to the loss of the system energy in the head - on collision of two black holes .",
    "in this paper , we presented a generalized bowen - york formulation for the initial value problem of multi  black holes in higher - dimensional space . using this formulation , we derived analytic solutions of the momentum constraint equation for extrinsic curvature of moving black holes in the conformally flat higher - dimensional space .",
    "as an application , initial data for head - on collision of two equal - mass black holes were computed numerically solving the hamiltonian constraint for the conformal factor .",
    "the properties of the obtained space such as the adm mass and the common ah were analyzed .",
    "we determined the critical line for formation of a common ah in the parameter space of @xmath159 .",
    "then , we evolved this system using the close - slow approximation and analyzed gravitational waves .",
    "we derived the formula for the radiated energy for a wide variety of @xmath1 [ see eq .   together with table  [ c1c2c3 ] ] and clarified that it depends weakly on @xmath1 ; irrespective of @xmath1 the efficiency is less than @xmath152 for @xmath160 and @xmath161 .    as we mentioned in sec .",
    "i , one of the motivations of this study is to clarify the total radiated energy of gravitational waves in the black hole formation through particle collisions in accelerators . however , there are two shortcomings in this study .",
    "one is that we use the linear perturbation method which provides a reliable result only for small values of @xmath135 and @xmath129 .",
    "the other is that the bowen - york black holes system does not accurately model the high - energy particles system .    as for the first problem",
    ", we can learn from the four - dimensional study . in @xcite ,",
    "the results of the close - slow approximation and of the fully nonlinear numerical simulation are compared .",
    "it shows that the results in the close - slow approximation agrees approximately with the fully nonlinear results for small separation and small momentum .",
    "however , the difference becomes larger as separation or momentum is increased . for @xmath162 , the nonlinear numerical results indicate that the radiation efficiency increases as @xmath129 is increased and approaches to an asymptotic value , while extrapolation of the linear perturbation results gives infinity . to know the results for @xmath162 in higher - dimensional spacetime ,",
    "obviously , fully nonlinear numerical simulation is necessary .",
    "the difference between the high - energy particles and the bowen - york black holes is the other problem . as the model of a high - energy particle",
    ", the metric of aichelburg - sexl  @xcite is often used .",
    "it is obtained by boosting the schwarzschild black hole to the speed of light with fixed energy @xmath163 and taking lightlike limit @xmath164 .",
    "the gravitational field is localized in the transverse plane to the direction of motion and forms a gravitational shock wave , which is a reminiscent of the infinite lorentz contraction of the isotropic gravitational field of the original schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the spacetime is flat except at the shock wave and this enables us to write down the metric of two high - energy particles outside of the lightcone of shock collision .",
    "hence , the ah formation at the instant of collision has been investigated so far  @xcite .",
    "obviously , gravitational field ( the conformal factor or the extrinsic curvature ) is not localized in the case of bowen - york black holes .",
    "this indicates that the bowen - york black holes system can not be a precise model for the high - energy particles system even in the case @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "actually , there exist several discussions  @xcite about the fact that the bowen - york black hole system contains unphysical gravitational waves , i.e. , so - called junk energy .",
    "thus , in the fully nonlinear numerical calculation with the bowen - york initial data , one should take into account the possibility that junk energy changes the estimate of radiation efficiency . to avoid this",
    ", one should make the junk energy radiate away before the collision setting the initial separation sufficiently large .    finally , we comment on the importance of the study of the grazing collision . in the head - on collision case ,",
    "the upper bound on the radiation efficiency ( @xmath167 ) in the head - on collision of aichelburg - sexl particles was obtained  @xcite by studying the ah area and applying the area theorem .",
    "although the same discussion was done in the grazing collision with nonzero impact parameter @xmath168  @xcite , the upper bound on the radiation efficiency is very weak for large @xmath168 .",
    "hence , the direct calculation of gravitational radiation in the grazing collision is more important than the head - on collision case .",
    "also , it is required to calculate the kerr parameter of the resultant black hole . in order to solve these problems , the off - axis collision of the bowen - york black holes",
    "could be an approximation and provide several implications .",
    "we plan to study this process using the close - slow approximation as a first step .",

    "we briefly comment on other solutions of @xmath30 for the momentum constraint  , which were not introduced in sec .",
    "since the equations for @xmath33 and @xmath34 are pure laplace equations , we can make infinite number of solutions for the extrinsic curvature . here , we present solution of low - multipole momenta .    to make a spinning black hole , we write @xmath169 where @xmath170 is an anti - symmetric tensor .",

    "<S> scenarios of large extra dimensions have enhanced the importance for the study of black holes in higher dimensions . in this paper , we analyze an axisymmetric system of two black holes . specifically , the bowen - york method is generalized for higher dimensions in order to calculate the initial data for head - on collision of two equal - mass black holes . </S>",
    "<S> then , the initial data are evolved adopting the close - slow approximation to study gravitational waves emitted during the collision . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an empirical formula for radiation efficiency , which depends weakly on the dimensionality . </S>",
    "<S> possible implications of our results for the black hole formation in particle colliders are discussed . </S>"
