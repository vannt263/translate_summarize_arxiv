    "among the about 25 @xmath0-ray bursts localized by the bepposax _ wide field cameras _ ( wfcs ) , most of those followed - up with the _ narrow field instruments _ ( nfis ) onboard the same satellite have exhibited afterglows at x - ray energies ( e.g. , costa et al .",
    "1997 ) , whereas less than half of them have exhibited afterglows in the optical , ir , and/or radio ( e.g. , van paradijs et al .  1997 ; frail et al .",
    "most x - ray afterglows show a smooth power - law decay ( with indices between @xmath81.1 to @xmath81.9 ) , the exceptions being grb970508 ( piro et al .",
    "1998 ) and grb970828 ( yoshida et al .  1999 ) , which exhibit re - bursting events on time scales of a few hours and a day , respectively , superimposed on a power - law trend .",
    "the brightest x - ray afterglow so far , i.e.  that of grb990123 , provided the first detection of hard x - ray ( 1560kev ) afterglow emission ( heise et al .",

    "the light curve of the optical afterglow of grb990510 does not follow a simple power - law decay , but showed smooth steepening after about one and a half day after the @xmath0-ray burst ( harrison et al .",

    "traces of such a characteristic have also been found in the optical afterglow of grb990123 ( kulkarni et al .",

    "it has been regarded as the signature of a decreasing collimation in a relativistic flow ( sari et al .",
    "1999 ; rhoads 1999 ) . such behavior has never been observed in the x - ray afterglows of grbs .",
    "the relatively large brightness of the grb990510 x - ray afterglow allows an excellent opportunity to study the x - ray light curve in search of such a feature .",
    "the grbm consists of the 4 anti - coincidence shields of the _ phoswich detection system _ ( pds ; frontera et al .",

    "the data from the grbm include rates with 1s time resolution and energy ranges of 40700kev and @xmath11100kev , and average 240-channel spectra in the 40700kev band every 128s ( independently phased from grb trigger times ) . for our spectral analysis",
    "we use data in the 70650kev band , since in this energy range the grbm 240-channels response matrix is known with sufficient accuracy . for studying the grb spectral evolution we use the 1s ratemeters , and we check their consistency with the grb time averaged spectra obtained from the 240 channel data ( see amati et al .",
    "1999b ) .",
    "grb990510 was detected by the grbm , but the instrument was not triggered to a grb data acquisition mode , because a previous false event prevented this .",
    "therefore , no high time resolution data have been acquired for this burst and the time resolution is limited to 1s .",
    "the nfi include two imaging and two non - imaging instruments .",
    "the imaging instruments are the _ low - energy concentrator spectrometer _ ( lecs ) , sensitive from 0.1 to 10kev ( parmar et al.1997 ) , and the _ medium - energy concentrator spectrometer _",

    "in our analysis we used data from the lecs , mecs and pds .",
    "the 3@xmath12 radius wfc error box of grb990510 was observed by the nfi from 8.0 to 44.3 hours after the batse trigger time , i.e.  from mjd51308.7051310.22 ( ut 1999 may 10.7012.22 ) .",
    "the total lecs , mecs and pds on - source exposure times were 31.7 , 67.9 and 41.5ksec , respectively .",

    "two main pulses @xmath140s apart are observed . between these pulses",
    "the grb flux level is consistent with zero .",
    "the first pulse contains two sub - pulses with peak fluxes in the ratio 3:1 .",
    "the second pulse consists of 5 sub - pulses with the first two having the highest peak flux and the following three being much weaker ( by a factor of about 6 ) .",
    "the entire grb duration is 75s .",
    "the grb fluence in the 40700kev band is ( 1.9@xmath130.2 ) @xmath2erg@xmath3 , while the peak flux reached in the same energy band is ( 2.4@xmath130.2 ) @xmath14erg@xmath3s@xmath6 ( all errors quoted in this paper are 1@xmath15 uncertainties , unless noted otherwise . )",
    "we performed a spectral analysis of the prompt emission of grb990510 in the 70650kev band , by following approximately the same procedure used for , e.g. , grb970228 and grb980329 ( see frontera et al .",
    "1998 ; in t zand et al .  1998 ) . the average spectrum of the prompt emission of grb990510 can be satisfactorily described ( @xmath16 = 6.84 for 9 d.o.f . ) by a broken power - law , with a break energy @xmath17kev and power - law indices before and after the break of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "we note that a fit to the canonical @xmath0-ray burst spectral model as introduced by band et al .",
    "( 1993 ) is also acceptable ( @xmath16 = 7.65 for 9 dof ) ; however , we could not constrain the value of the power - law index below the peak energy @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the other band parameters , i.e.  the break energy or cut - off energy , @xmath23 , and power - law index above @xmath20 , @xmath24 , in this fit are @xmath25kev and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we also studied the spectral evolution of the prompt emission by assuming that a power - law @xmath27 connects the two energy bands 40100kev and 100700kev , and that the burst flux above 700kev is negligible .",
    "the photon index @xmath28 , computed as a color index between the two energy ranges , is reported in the bottom panel of fig .  1",
    ": the spectrum seems to slightly soften during the first main pulse . when the second main pulse starts , the spectrum is harder before it softens .",
    "the indices have typical values for grbs .",
    "the combined image from mecs units 2 and 3 shows clearly the presence of a previously unknown bright source within the wfc error circle , formerly proposed as the x - ray counterpart of the grb ( piro et al .",
    "1999b , kuulkers et al .",
    "it is elongated toward the nnw direction ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "this extension is likely due to the presence of an unresolved point source , partially contaminating the bright source .",
    "another x - ray source is present @xmath113arcmin nnw of the bright source , and outside the wfc error circle of grb990510 . the lecs image ,",
    "albeit less exposed than the mecs image , also shows a bright source , with a similar extension .",
    "the proximity of the probable x - ray afterglow candidate to the weaker , contaminating source makes an accurate spatial analysis necessary , accounting for the extended tails of the point - spread functions of the lecs and mecs instruments , in order to separate the two point sources .",
    "we used different independent approaches to resolve this problem and performed fits of the resulting spectra .",
    "we here discuss one of these approaches , the maximum likelihood method , since the main results of this paper are obtained using this approach .",
    "the other two approaches serve as a consistency check of the former approach and are described in appendix  a. for all spectral fits , the background was evaluated from blank sky observations , after checking its stability with several source - free regions around the x - ray afterglow .",
    "the lecs spectrum was considered only in the 0.24kev interval , due to calibration uncertainties above @xmath14kev .",
    "the mecs spectrum was considered in the 210kev range .    in the maximum likelihood method one searches for single point sources on top of a background model ( assumed to be flat ,",
    "i.e.  cosmic diffuse x - ray and particle - induced background ) . with this method , which allows a simultaneous analysis of several sources",
    ", one retrieves all photons from the point sources as detected by the instrument ( for a more detailed description of the method we refer to kuiper et al .",
    "1998 and in t zand et al .",

    "this method shows that the lecs and mecs image can be satisfactorily described by three point sources on top of a flat background model .",

    "we note that no other source near 1saxj1337.6@xmath88027 has been reported previously at other wavelengths , while 1saxj1336.0@xmath88018 lies close ( within @xmath12@xmath12 ) to the radio source pmnj1335@xmath88016 ( wright et al .",

    "the spectra are at all times statistically well described by a single power - law , whose index does not change significantly during the afterglow decay ( see table  3 ) .",

    "grb990510 ranks among the top 25%  of the brightest grb observed by the grbm , while it ranks among the top 4%  ( 9% ) of the batse burst flux ( fluence ) distribution ( kippen et al .",

    "is well described by a broken power - law , with a break energy of @xmath1200kev .",
    "the fluence , peak flux and spectrum as measured with the grbm are comparable to those measured with batse . with the repeated pulses and \" hard - to - soft  spectral evolution , the @xmath0-ray light curve and spectral behavior of grb990510 are reminiscent of grb970228 ( frontera et al .",

    "it is clear that the optical data are not consistent with a power - law decay in that time span .",
    "we fitted the x - ray afterglow light curve with the same function as above , while fixing the decay indices to those derived in the optical .",
    "we find that the corresponding fits are bad , with @xmath16 values of 2427 for 14 d.o.f .",
    ", depending on which parameter values we use among those reported by the different authors ( stanek et al .  1999 , harrison et al",
    ".  1999 , israel et al .  1999 ) .",
    "a steepening in the light curves can be expected in the fireball model when the cooling frequency moves towards lower frequencies in the observed frequency range . in that case",
    "the decay index @xmath40 changes by 0.25 ( sari et al .  1998 ) .",
    "however , the steepening of the optical decay is independent of wavelength ( or achromatic ) and the optical decay index @xmath40 changes by @xmath1@xmath81.36 ( harrison et al .",
    "we provide additional evidence against a changing cooling frequency . in that case",
    "one would expect the optical decay index to be similar to that in the x - ray band , in contrast to what is observed .",
    "it has recently been realized that not all afterglow light curves are consistent with emission from expanding shells that are spherically symmetric , but that beaming may be important ( i.e. , jets , see e.g.  sari et al .  1999 ; rhoads 1999 ) .",
    "such jets explain the presence of the steepening observed in the optical afterglow light curves of grb990510 ( e.g.  harrison et al.1999 ) .",
    "sari et al .  ( 1999 ) presented general expressions for the expected spectral and decay index , appropriate for both spherical shell and jet evolutions shortly after the @xmath0-ray event .",
    "our observed x - ray spectral index of @xmath81.03@xmath130.08 implies a value of the index @xmath41 of the electron energy distribution in the expanding material of @xmath42 in the case of fast cooling ( i.e. , when the cooling frequency is below the x - ray range ) . in the alternate case ( i.e.",
    ", the cooling frequency is above the x - ray range ) we derive @xmath43 .",
    "harrison et al.(1999 ) found that the optical light curves can only imply @xmath42 , where the cooling frequency is above the optical wavelength range .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the cooling frequency is between the optical and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "note that the cooling frequency stays constant for a spreading jet ( sari et al .",
    "1999 ) .    at early times after the burst the decay light curve of a collimated source is identical to that of a spherical one ,",
    "since then only a small portion of the emitting surface is visible due to relativistic beaming ( the opening angle then is @xmath44 , where @xmath0 is the lorentz factor ) . in that case",
    "the decay index , @xmath40 , is expected to be @xmath45 in the case of fast cooling ( i.e.  steeper than in the optical : @xmath46 ; sari et al .",
    "as the fireball evolves , @xmath0 decreases , and the beaming angle will eventually exceed the jet opening angle . at that time",
    "one will see a break in the light curve , with @xmath47 , while the optical and x - ray decay index are similar after the break .",
    "therefore , we fitted the x - ray afterglow light curve again , now fixing @xmath48 and @xmath49 to @xmath81.1 and @xmath82.1 , respectively , and @xmath50 to that found in the optical .",
    "this leads to good fits with @xmath16 values of about 12 for 14 dof .",
    "the corresponding fit is also shown in fig .  4 ( dotted line ) with extrapolations to the boundaries of the plot .",
    "this shows that the observed x - ray afterglow of grb990510 is consistent with the jet interpretation . as evident from fig .  4",
    ", x - ray observations of the very early afterglow or a long time after the break time could have clearly discriminated whether the x - ray afterglow light curve is described by a single power law or consistent with the jet interpretation .",
    "we conclude that , even if we could not distinguish the presence of a clear break in the x - ray light curve , the only explanation within the fireball model consistent with the x - ray and optical data is a jet evolution , where the cooling frequency lies between the optical and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "future observations of afterglows at late times with the x - ray observatories recently launched ( chandra and xmm - newton ) may provide a direct evidence of such a temporal x - ray feature .",

    "one of the other methods to investigate source - rich regions is currently implemented in the x - ray spectral fitting code spex ( kaastra et al .",
    "this approach consists of simultaneously fitting the spectra from different detector sections , taking into account the spill - over from photons coming from one detector section into another detector section of the sky . for a detailed description of this method",
    "we refer to vink et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and kaastra et al .",
    "the detector sections we used are two circles of 3@xmath12 radius ( which limits the effect of contamination due to source proximity ) , centered on the positions of 1saxj1338.1@xmath88030 and 1saxj1337.6@xmath88027 obtained from the maximum likelihood method .",
    "note that in the case of the lecs a non - negligible amount of photons will lie outside the extraction regions , especially at low energies ( @xmath5120%  for @xmath521kev in the case of a 3@xmath12 extraction radius ) , due to its relatively large point spread function ; this leads to some degradation in the sensitivity at these energies .",
    "the extraction of the spectra and the generation of response matrices takes into account the characteristics of both the lecs and mecs .",
    "the spectral resolution is oversampled by the lecs and mecs energy channels , therefore we rebinned the spectra so that roughly each resolved energy bin contains three spectral channels .",
    "the hydrogen absorption column density , n@xmath29 , was forced to be similar for both 1saxj1338.1@xmath88030 and 1saxj1337.6@xmath88027 , since leaving them both free led to unstable fits for 1saxj1337.6@xmath88027 .",
    "the best - fit value of the normalization between the lecs and mecs was found to be @xmath10.8 , and we therefore fixed it to 0.8 . both the spectrum of 1saxj1338.1@xmath88030 and 1saxj1337.6@xmath88027 are simultaneously well described by power - law models ( subject to interstellar absorption ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters for both sources are given in table  2 .",
    "we also evaluated the spectral fitting results offered by the maximum likelihood method , by following , for the spectral extraction , the classical method , which is more or less appropriate only for isolated point sources .",
    "we extracted the spectra within circles of radius 8@xmath12 and 4@xmath12 , for the lecs and mecs , respectively , centered on the best - fit position of 1saxj1338.1@xmath88030 obtained with the maximum - likelihood method .",
    "the resulting spectra were also rebinned to bin sizes corresponding to roughly one third of the detector spectral fwhm resolution , with the additional constraint that each bin contained at least 20 counts .    since the fitted centroids of 1saxj1338.1@xmath88030 and of 1saxj1337.6@xmath88027 are only 3.8 arcmin apart , the resulting spectra clearly contain the summed contribution of the two sources .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the results of the spectral fits are reasonable if the x - ray flux of 1saxj1337.6@xmath88027 is negligible with respect to that of 1saxj1338.1@xmath88030 and/or if 1saxj1337.6@xmath88027 does not vary over the observed time interval .",
    "since the maximum likelihood method showed that the spectrum and emission level of 1saxj1337.6@xmath88027 do not significantly vary with time , we fixed the contribution from 1saxj1337.6@xmath88027 to that found by the spex method and fitted the afterglow spectrum by leaving the hydrogen column density as a free parameter .",
    "the best - fit parameters are also reported in table 2 .",
