    "recent observational advances place more stringent bounds on the predictions of inflation , for example the planck mission  @xcite . when the modes relevant for the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations exit the horizon during inflation , the slow - roll approximation is supposed to be working very well . consequently , the properties of the primordial curvature perturbation , which after inflation becomes the seed of the observed temperature fluctuations in the cmb as well as large scale distribution of galaxies , are determined by the form of the inflaton potential in simple canonical models  @xcite . for example , the spectral index @xmath0 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath1 , see and respectively . more precise estimates of them , however , require full understanding of the thermal history of the universe beyond the end of the inflationary phase . the largest terra incognita is the stage between the end of inflation and the beginning of the standard radiation dominated epoch , during which the energy in the inflaton sector is transferred to the standard model sector  @xcite .",
    "the detail of this reheating process is much less understood , as the huge range the reheating temperature @xmath2 may lie within indicates , 1 mev @xmath3 gev in order to avoid gravitino overproduction if one considers supersymmetric models  @xcite . ] .",
    "nevertheless , like single field slow - roll inflation , there is a simple , minimal scenario of reheating  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the inflaton oscillates around the minimum of its effective potential after inflation ends , with a decreasing amplitude due to the damping by the cosmic expansion , until the expansion rate @xmath4 falls down below the decay rate @xmath5 of the inflaton .",
    "then the energy of the inflaton sector is transferred into the standard model sector efficiently and the universe becomes dominated by relativistic particles , corresponding to a reheating temperature @xmath6  @xcite . therefore in this minimal scenario of reheating",
    ", there are two parameters needed for deriving the duration of reheating , @xmath7 : an effective equation of state @xmath8 to describe the expansion rate during the oscillating phase of the inflaton , and the decay rate @xmath5 to determine when reheating happens .",
    "the constraint to the reheating temperature can be derived from the observational constraints of @xmath9 and @xmath1 once @xmath8 is known .",
    "given the potential form , @xmath8 can be derived , for instance as in the case of power - law chaotic inflation  @xcite . for a typical case where the local minimum is quadratic and @xmath10 , in a universal class of model where @xmath0 is inversely proportional to the number of @xmath11-folds during inflation , we can constrain @xmath2 within a factor of @xmath12 or so . with future precision experiments ,",
    "this constraint can be further reduced to a factor of @xmath13 or even better .",
    "if the effective potential is not quadratic at the minimum where @xmath14 , the above estimation for the reheating temperature may not be valid . in an extreme case where @xmath15 , the observational data can not give any constraint on @xmath2 .",
    "equivalently , it is secure to say that the predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 become robust and independent of the detail of reheating in this case if we assume the minimal scenario of reheating .",
    "we find that the @xmath16 model , even with a non - minimal coupling to gravity such as the case of higgs inflation , has this property .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : general ] , we revisit how the post - inflationary evolution , particularly reheating , leads to a theoretical uncertainty in the number of @xmath11-folds of expansion during inflation , @xmath17 .",
    "this theoretical uncertainty is then translated into those of the inflationary model predictions such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which depend on the effective equation of state of the inflaton during reheating in the minimal scenario .",
    "we illustrate this using chaotic inflation with a monomial potential as an example as in  @xcite .",
    "we then move on discuss how one might use this theoretical uncertainty due to reheating to constrain the reheating temperature in some general universality classes of models in future precision experiments . in section  [ sec : nonminimal ] , we then discuss a specific example , the non - minimally coupled @xmath16 model , where the model predictions are robust and independent of the detail of reheating in the minimal scenario of reheating . section  [ sec : conc ] is devoted to a short summary .",
    "we consider a certain mode of the comoving wavenumber @xmath18 which exits the horizon during inflation at @xmath19 . considering the ratio of this scale to the size of the present horizon @xmath20",
    ", we can relate it to various scales that correspond to critical moments in the cosmic history as  @xcite @xmath21 where the subscript @xmath11 and rh denote , respectively , the end of inflation and the onset of radiation dominated era , viz .",
    "the moment of reheating .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the @xmath11-folding numbers between the end of inflation and the horizon crossing of the mode of our interest , and the moment of reheating , respectively . here",
    "@xmath24 is highly dependent on the detail of reheating and is related to the reheating temperature @xmath2 which appears implicitly in @xmath25 . assuming the conservation of entropy after reheating , @xmath25 can be written as  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the effective number of light species for entropy at the moment of reheating .",
    "thus without detailed knowledge of the reheating process , any attempt to estimate @xmath28 in is fundamentally restrictive even after we specify a model of inflation . in the following ,",
    "we assume the minimal reheating scenario  @xcite where after inflation ends the inflaton coherently oscillates around the minimum of the potential , followed by decay to relativistic particles .",
    "if the decay is fast enough , @xmath24 then depends only on how the inflaton oscillates around the minimum and is in principle also determined once a model of inflation is given .",
    "it can be written as  @xcite @xmath29 here , let us define @xmath30 .",
    "this means that the reheating temperature can be written as @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the effective number of relativistic species at the moment of reheating , that is not necessarily the same as @xmath27 .",
    "then , from @xmath28 is estimated by @xmath33 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad + \\frac{1 - 3w_{{\\rm rh}}}{12(1+w_{{\\rm rh}})}\\log\\beta \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a fixed comoving scale @xmath18 , the first and second terms on the right hand side can be very accurately determined by observations , whereas the third term and fourth term depend respectively upon the model of inflation and the underlying particle physics models after reheating ends . for realistic particle physics models , @xmath34 .",
    "given @xmath28 only depends on @xmath27 and @xmath35 logarithmically , it is accurate enough to take the general case where @xmath36 .",
    "together they give the upper limit of @xmath28 as long as @xmath37 .",
    "in general these contributions depend only weakly on the detail of the inflation model and the thermal history after reheating , as the dependence is logarithmic .",
    "the last term represents the correction from reheating .",
    "once we find @xmath28 , or @xmath38 precisely , we can accurately evaluate the spectral index and tensor - to - scalar ratio , including higher - order slow - roll corrections  @xcite @xmath39 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "let us first we consider simple power - law potential @xmath45 with a canonical kinetic term .",
    "its effective equation of state during the oscillating phase can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath46 which is nearly constant if @xmath47 is a global power index .",
    "the computation is straightforward even analytically  @xcite , and the model predictions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the reheating correction are shown in figure  [ fig : chaotic ] .",
    "we can see that lower reheating temperature gives smaller @xmath0 and larger @xmath1 , and that the uncertainty vanishes for @xmath48 .",
    "this is because for @xmath49 , from we have @xmath50 and the last term in ( [ nk ] ) vanishes , thus the oscillation stage is indistinguishable from the radiation dominated epoch and the predictions of @xmath9 and @xmath1 become robust . for an exhaustive study on other canonical single field slow - roll inflation models ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "-@xmath1 plot for the power - law chaotic inflation .",
    "the rightmost solid line denotes the instantaneous reheating immediately right after inflation ends at around @xmath51 .",
    "the leftmost dot - dashed line is the lower bound for @xmath2 just above the nucleosynthesis bound @xmath52 .",
    "the intermediate dashed line symbols @xmath53 which is usually taken as the upper bound to avoid gravitino overproduction when supersymmetry is considered . different power indices for the potential at @xmath54 ,",
    "1 , 2 and 4 are marked by thick dashed lines .",
    "the planck 2015 contours ( larger , tt+lowp ) and ( smaller , tt , te , ee+lowp ) are also shown .",
    "notice that @xmath49 case gives a robust prediction , which , however , is excluded at 99.7% confidence level by the planck data.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    in fact , belongs to a universality class of models where the spectral index is inversely proportional to @xmath28 , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is constant and depends on models , e.g. @xmath57 for power - law inflation with @xmath58 in . besides power - law inflation",
    ", this universal scaling relation also applies to a wide range of models  @xcite including the @xmath59 inflation model  @xcite . with this universal scaling relation ,",
    "we can ask what is the range we can constrain for @xmath28 given a certain accuracy of measurements , which can be translated into that of the reheating temperature @xmath60 . from , the uncertainty in @xmath0 can be related to that in @xmath28 @xmath61 if we assume the main contribution to @xmath62 comes from the reheating correction term . with an accuracy of @xmath63 , which is expected from future observations such as the euclid satellite  @xcite , and a fiducial value @xmath64 from planck@xcite",
    ", we see this gives @xmath65 .",
    "considering a model that gives predictions within the observed range of @xmath0 , we deduce the uncertainty in @xmath2 we can constrain is @xmath66 for canonical oscillation around a quadratic minimum , where @xmath67 . for non - quadratic potentials",
    "the uncertainty can be different , and it can become as small as @xmath68 for @xmath69 . on the other extreme case where @xmath70 , @xmath28 is totally independent of @xmath2 and therefore @xmath2 is not constrained from @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these results are general as long as the model we consider are within the same universality class .",
    "we can consider as well a similar universal prediction on the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are some constants of @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , quadratic power - law potential gives @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding constraint on @xmath28 by the measurement on @xmath1 is given by @xmath76 for practical observability , we may consider only up to @xmath77 that gives @xmath78 , which is near the sensitivity of future observations on the @xmath79-mode polarization such as litebird  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath75 , @xmath1 is typically as large as @xmath80 .",
    "thus with the prospect @xmath81 we find @xmath82 , e.g. for quadratic power - law potential @xmath83  @xcite so that we can constrain @xmath2 with a good accuracy , @xmath84 even for smaller value of @xmath1 with @xmath77 , @xmath85 is better than or at least as good as what we can obtain from @xmath0 : for @xmath86 , we can find @xmath87 .",
    "similarly , we can do the same for the running of the spectral index , @xmath88 . from , in general @xmath89 ,",
    "so that the constraint on @xmath28 we can obtain from the measurement of @xmath88 is @xmath90 with @xmath91 being constant . given the fiducial value @xmath92 and the accuracy @xmath93 that could be achieved in joint constraints using cmb and future large scale structure or 21 cm observations like square kilometre array  @xcite , we can expect @xmath68 .",
    "thus a detection of @xmath88 in future experiments would give a better or compatible constraint on @xmath2 compared to that given by the measurements of @xmath0 .",
    "we should stress that in general the predictions of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath94 do not only depend on the inflation and reheating dynamics , but also on other phases after the end of inflation .",
    "phases additional to the usual post - inflationary cosmic history where reheating is followed by radiation and matter dominated eras , if any , also induce uncertainties in @xmath28 and thus can bias our predictions of the bound of the reheating temperature . we confine ourselves within the minimal scenario and do not consider such scenarios here .",
    "the power - law potential we have discussed in the previous section , which belongs to the universal class , is usually regarded as an effective description at around the energy scale of inflation .",
    "the effective equation of state is only valid when the power index @xmath47 remains the same both in the large field region and the neighborhood of the minimum .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the extension to this monomial power - law inflation , like for instance the polynomial inflation stemmed from renormalizability  @xcite or some superpotentials  @xcite .",
    "these examples can be still described by and after we simplify the polynomial to a piecewise potential , all the discussions are parallel . as in  @xcite , a natural cutoff of the power series will be at @xmath49 , which means the potential behaves as quartic in the large field region .",
    "it is already clear that the constraint on the reheating temperature becomes loose when @xmath47 is approaching @xmath95 , or , from another point of view , @xmath96 gives a robust prediction for @xmath0 and @xmath1 independent of the detail of reheating .",
    "however , as now the large - field monomial quartic potential is excluded at @xmath97 confidence level by the planck data  @xcite , it is worthwhile to seek for other models that are also independent of the reheating temperature @xmath2 .",
    "a natural consideration is to introduce a non - minimal coupling to gravity for the quartic monomial or polynomial up to quartic , which is also physically well motivated by the higgs inflation model  @xcite .",
    "the action in the jordan frame is @xmath98 \\ , .\\ ] ] in higgs inflation @xmath99 is identified as the standard model higgs boson and there is a vacuum expectation value @xmath100 in the potential corresponding to the mass @xmath101  @xcite , which is neglected here . performing the conformal transformation of the metric @xmath102 , we can work in the einstein frame with the following action @xmath103 \\ , , \\ ] ] where the canonically normalized field in the einstein frame @xmath104 is connected to @xmath99 by  @xcite @xmath105 and the effective potential in the einstein frame @xmath106 is related to the jordan frame potential by @xmath107 note that since the conformal transformation factor to the einstein frame is a function of @xmath99 only , perturbations and their correlation functions are equivalent in both frames  @xcite and calculations can be performed in the einstein frame .",
    "for example , the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation is @xmath108 which can be used to replace @xmath109 , and the energy density at the end of inflation as @xmath110    in the minimal scenario of reheating ( see also  @xcite ) , @xmath8 depends upon only the field dynamics near the minimum of the potential . for @xmath111",
    ", there is little deviation from the simple quartic power - law potential , so that @xmath112 and the predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are fixed irrespective of @xmath2 .",
    "they lie , however , on a curve rather than a single point on the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane depending on the value of @xmath113 . on the other hand , for @xmath114",
    ", there exists a critical value @xmath115 where the form of the potential changes  @xcite : @xmath116 where @xmath117 corresponds to the end of inflation and @xmath118 is the critical point where the dominant term in the potential changes .",
    "thus , right after inflation the oscillation is sinusoidal as in a quadratic potential and @xmath10 .",
    "if the inflaton decays before the oscillating amplitude becomes smaller than @xmath115 , reheating happens during this effectively matter dominated stage .",
    "if the decay happens later , the potential is quartic and @xmath50 .",
    "again , it goes into the region where the prediction on @xmath0 and @xmath1 is independent of the reheating temperature .",
    "we have to find the range of @xmath113 where the approximation is valid .",
    "we can see from that if @xmath113 is not large enough , the energy density at the critical value @xmath115 will be larger than that at the end of inflation and the potential exhibits only monimial quartic power , leaving no quadratic behavior as in .",
    "the value of @xmath113 where this happens , @xmath119 , can be found by solving @xmath120 which , with and , gives @xmath121 it is not much larger than 1 but we can still assume that the potential take the form of when @xmath122 .    using the same procedure as in section  [ sec : general ]",
    ", we can find @xmath28 similar to .",
    "if @xmath123 , the predictions are identical to the instantaneous reheating , for which @xmath28 is given by just with @xmath124 . if @xmath122 , the intermediate quadratic stage @xmath125 also affects the evolution and we have an extended version of : @xmath126 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad + \\left [ \\frac{1}{3\\left(1+w_1\\right ) } - \\frac{1}{3\\left(1+w_2\\right ) } \\right ] \\log \\left ( \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{cr}}}{\\rho_e } \\right ) + \\frac{1 - 3w_2}{12(1+w_2)}\\log\\beta \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath127 is the energy density at the critical point @xmath115 , and @xmath128 and @xmath129 denote respectively the effective equations of state for the oscillating phase before and after the critical point @xmath115 .",
    "note that @xmath130 disappears in the final result as @xmath131 , which means that all the predictions for a reheating temperature smaller than @xmath132 are the same .",
    "this is a strong assert implying the robustness of the predictions for the entire model as we can see in figure  [ fig : nonminimal ] .",
    "the relation can be extended to multiple stages , which can be used to study a piecewise potential for example including the final quadratic oscillation around the minimum at @xmath133 in the higgs inflation , which is also shown in figure  [ fig : nonminimal ] . in general , a polynomial potential , if the characteristic scales for each term to dominate have a hierarchy structure as in , can always be approximated by a piecewise potential and studied similarly as in .",

    "this case is almost indistinguishable from the instantaneous reheating for @xmath136 , but approaches the predictions of the @xmath59 model for large @xmath113 .",

    "however , the same point in the asymptotic line predicted by the non - minimal coupling model with a large @xmath113 and by the @xmath59 inflation model corresponds to different reheating temperatures in these two different models .",
    "for example , the point in figure  [ fig : nonminimal ] of @xmath141 represents a huge range of reheating temperature of @xmath142 in the non - minimal coupling model , while it only corresponds to a single but much smaller reheating temperature of @xmath143 in the @xmath59 inflation model .",
    "it is becasue the effective equation of state @xmath8 is different in the two models . in the non - minimal coupling model , @xmath144 over a huge range of reheating temperature whereas @xmath145 in @xmath59 inflation .",
    "thus although the non - minimal model provides the @xmath146 scaling to the tilt as @xmath59 inflation in the regime we consider , the bounds on @xmath2 are much worse here as we can see from .",
    "the uncertainty from reheating occupies only a very small region in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane when the potential is approximately quadratic .",
    "note that the reheating temperature for the higgs inflation lies in the region  @xcite @xmath147 the largest possible uncertainty for @xmath11-foldings is given by @xmath148 for a typical value of @xmath149 . also , the corresponding @xmath0 and @xmath1 with this uncertainty @xmath62 taken into account are @xmath150 an interesting point is that a lower bound of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath151 is predicted irrespective of @xmath113 .",
    "note that a detailed study of reheating including the preheating stage in the higgs inflation model is presented in  @xcite in parallel with  @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we have studied the contributions of reheating to the predictions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "assuming perturbative and fast reheating , the uncertainty from reheating is determined by the reheating temperature @xmath2 and the effective equation of state during the oscillating stage after inflation , which is determined by the inflation model .",
    "we have considered a universal class of predictions on the uncertainty in the reheating temperature , and found that future observations can pin down @xmath2 within a factor of @xmath13 optimistically if the oscillation around the minima of inflation potential is sinusoidal and @xmath10 .",
    "we have also considered the inflation model with a scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity , motivated by the higgs inflation , as a typical example that has a different oscillation behavior .",
    "we have found that its predictions are insensitive to the reheating temperature , allowing precise predictions even without any knowledge of reheating . in studying this model ,",
