    "systems of interacting fermions are in superfluid phases at low enough temperatures .",
    "thus the core and inner crust regions of neutron stars consist mainly of superfluid neutrons .",
    "the neutron superfluid in the core , carrying the bulk of the mass and moment of inertia of the star , is the most important agent in the star s rotational dynamics .",
    "the observed timing properties , the period and spindown rate of the outer crust , are determined by the external magnetospheric torques as well as the internal torques reflecting angular momentum exchange with the core and inner crust .",
    "the neutron superfluid is coupled to the crust through the interactions of its quantized vortex lines with the charged components , the protons and the electrons , which are tightly coupled to each other by electromagnetic forces and to the crust through electron viscosity .",
    "the protons in the neutron star core are likely to be in a type ii superconducting phase with a uniform density array of quantized flux lines carrying the magnetic flux through the core in a state of minimum free energy .",
    "although it makes up only a few percent of the neutron star s mass and moment of inertia , the proton superconductor plays a crucial role in the rotational dynamics of the neutron star by defining the physical properties and interactions of neutron vortex lines .",
    "a primary effect of the coexistence of two interacting superfluids , the neutron superfluid and the proton superconductor is that the two superfluid currents drag each other such that the neutron superfluid circulation around a quantized neutron vortex line drags a proton supercurrent circulating the vortex line .",
    "the induced `` spontaneous '' magnetization of the vortex lines make them scatter any relative electron and proton current strongly .",
    "this effect leads to very short coupling times between the superfluid core and the observed outer crust of a neutron star ( alpar , langer & sauls 1984 ) .",
    "observational clues and constraints on the dynamical properties of neutron star cores come from the study of pulsar timing , pulsar glitches in particular .",
    "glitches are observed sudden increases in the rotation frequency .",
    "there is also a jump in the magnitude of the angular frequency derivative , the spindown rate of the pulsar .",
    "there are no signs of change in the _ external _ magnetospheric torque , as would be reflected as changes in the electromagnetic signature of the pulsar concurrent with the glitch .",
    "this in turn is assumed to indicate that the spin - up of the crust is due to an exchange of angular momentum _ within _ the star .",
    "the timescales found in the relaxation of the system after a glitch extend to the order of days and months , timescales too long for normal fluid viscosity ekman processes .",
    "this is the argument , based on observations , for the presence of superfluid components in neutron stars .",
    "fractional changes in the spindown rate at glitches and during postglitch relaxation indicate that the superfluid component involved contains about a few percent of the star s moment of inertia .",
    "this correlates very well with the inertia of the neutron superfluid in the crustal region .",
    "the dynamical properties of the inner crust superfluid , modeled in detail , explain the observed postglitch relaxation times ( alpar et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the implication is that superfluids in the neutron star s bulk , the core , must be already coupled rigidly to the observed outer crust on timescales shorter than the glitch rise times , which have been resolved down to about 30 seconds in the vela pulsar ( dodson , lewis & mcculloch 2007 )",
    ". calculations of the dynamical coupling times between a neutron superfluid in the core and the crust and charged components of the star , based on the scattering of charges against spontaneously magnetized neutron vortex lines , indeed yield such short relaxation times ( alpar , langer & sauls 1984 , alpar & sauls 1988 , andersson , sidery & comer 2006 , sidery 2009 ) .",
    "the vortex lines in the core superfluid should also be interacting with the flux lines carried by the proton superconductor . since vortex lines are aligned with the rotation axis and flux lines along the magnetic axis of the neutron star , it is unavoidable that vortex line motions , in particular motions radially outward from the rotation axis that should take place if the core neutron superfluid is to spin down , will encounter flux lines .",
    "vortex line flux line junctions are energetically favorable , as the condensation energy cost of the normal matter phase in the central regions of both types of lines will be reduced by utilizing the overlap volume at a junction .",
    "this potential pinning of vortex lines to flux lines , and modes of vortex line motion against flux line pinning must clearly play a role in determining the rotational dynamics of the neutron star core , as was first pointed out by sauls ( 1989 ) as a possible agent for pulsar glitches .",
    "the vortex line flux line interaction was also proposed as an agent for correlated spindown and magnetic field decay on evolutionary timescales for neutron stars in binaries , evolving towards the low mass x - ray binary and subsequent millisecond pulsar configuration ( srinivasan et al 1990 ) .",
    "when investigating the internal dynamics of neutron stars the various interactions of the two superfluid constituents may be of comparable importance .",
    "in this paper we investigate the dynamics of the neutron superfluid in the star s core by taking into account , for the first time , the vortex line - flux line interaction together with the previously investigated effect of scattering of charged particles against the spontaneously magnetized vortex lines .",
    "we treat the neutron star core as a two component system , with superfluid neutrons as one component and the charged particles , electrons and superconducting protons that are electromagnetically rigidly coupled together as the second component .",
    "if the charged fluid is treated in similar fashion as the normal component in a terrestrial superfluid , then comparisons can be made to the dynamics of vortex lines in superfluid helium .",
    "in contrast to helium the second component in the neutron star contains magnetic flux tubes .",
    "the interactions between the neutron vortices and the magnetic flux tubes will complicate the dynamics .",
    "there will be several possible scenarios .",
    "the first is that the energy needed for a neutron vortex to overcome the favourable conditions at a junction and pass through a flux line will be so large that a vortex line effectively never passes through a flux line . when the neutron vortices motion is thus locked to another component of the star vortices",
    "are said to be pinned . because we are considering pinning on flux _",
    "lines _ - prohibition of motion through flux lines - there is still freedom to move in the direction parallel to the magnetic flux lines .",
    "this is different from the situation often considered in the inner crust superfluid where the neutron vortices pin to the crustal lattice . in this case",
    "the vortices are pinned to specific fixed nuclei and so the vortex has no freedom to move in any direction unless it unpins . at the other extreme",
    "the energy barrier of the obstruction could be so low that the neutron vortices simply pass through the flux tubes with no hindrance . in between these two cases",
    "is that in which the vortices may gain enough energy to pass through via thermal fluctuations , supporting some average rate of vortex motion in the direction perpendicular to the flux lines .",
    "thermally activated vortex motion in the presence of pinning barriers is known as vortex creep ( alpar et al 1984a ) .",
    "in section 2 we review the dynamics in the presence of drag forces on neutron vortices alone , setting up the description of vortex motion in response to local forces as well as the ensuing macroscopic dynamics . in section 3",
    ", we investigate the case of magnetic flux lines acting as absolute barriers to obstruct vortex motion .",
    "the case of vortex creep across the flux lines is treated in section 4 . in both cases , vortex motion in the direction parallel to the flux lines",
    "is governed by the damping force due to the scattering of charged particles against the vortices .",
    "we consider the creep of vortex lines through a toroidal distribution of flux lines in section 5 .",
    "we use a simple model in which the superfluid constituents in the star , as well as the normal electron fluid rotate rigidly , and the rotation axes of all the constituents and the external torques on the star are aligned .",
    "the magnetic flux lines corotate with the charged component ( the electrons + the superconducting protons ) .",
    "the present paper addresses the dynamics of spindown ( or spinup ) of the neutron star under external torques , leaving the case of precession to a subsequent paper .",
    "before considering the global dynamical picture one needs to calculate the motion of a single neutron vortex under various forces .",
    "the equation of motion for a vortex line under a force * f * per unit length is the magnus equation @xmath0 the kinematic right hand side of this equation is sometimes called the `` magnus force '' . here @xmath1 is the mass density of the superfluid neutrons , @xmath2 is the vorticity vector directed along the vortex line , parallel to the rotation axis , with magnitude @xmath3 , the quantum of vorticity in terms of the planck constant and the bare neutron mass . @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the velocities of the neutron superfluid and the vortex line respectively .",

    "the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 are introduced to make contact with the conventional notation , employed in work on superfluid helium ( ref . ) , to describe the strength of the dissipative ( antiparallel to @xmath21 ) and inertial ( along @xmath22 ) parts of the force per unit length of a vortex line . in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath23 these coefficients are @xmath24 + superfluids with @xmath25 are said to be in the `` strong coupling '' regime , while @xmath26 are in the weak coupling regime .    in cylindrical coordinates with @xmath2 and the angular velocities of the neutron superfluid as well as the proton - electron component along the z - axis , the superfluid velocity is @xmath27 , in the azimuthal direction .",

    "the scattering is due to the very strong localized magnetic field structure carried by the neutron vortex lines .",
    "this `` spontaneous magnetization '' arises from proton supercurrents circulating the vortex line , dragged along with the usual neutron supercurrent circulation .",

    "the prefactor ( 10 - 200 ) describes the variation of @xmath11 with density , proton fraction and proton effective mass throughout the neutron star core , with shorter coupling times at higher densities .",

    "( [ eq : tauvortp ] ) gives @xmath43 since the charged component makes up only a small fraction of the density in the neutron star core , @xmath44 .",

    "the presence of flux lines therefore should not alter the dynamical coupling times significantly .",
    "the dynamical coupling times obtained from the particular range of drag coefficients @xmath46 of sedrakian & sedrakian ( 1995 ) are much longer than the observed glitch rise times",

    "the core superfluid remains in the very tight coupling with the charged component imposed by the presence of the flux lines .",
    "this result depends only logarithmically on the parameter values we have used .",
    "if the pinning energy is closer to the thermal energy ( @xmath180 ) then the creep process determines the relaxation of the core , @xmath181 , somewhat alleviating the almost rigid coupling to the charged component inferred in eq.([eq : reducedcouplingtime ] ) .",
    "recent stability simulations of the type of magnetic fields expected in neutron stars ( braithwaite 2008 ) suggest the presence of a large toroidal contribution to the internal magnetic field . in this case",
    "the flux lines prevent radially outwards motion of the superfluid vortices in all directions , so that any spin down of the superfluid must be due to creep .",
    "because of azimuthal symmetry , the macroscopic dynamics will in fact be the same as in the creep model for the crust superfluid .",
    "if toroidal flux lines coexist with the uniform array of flux lines aligned in the @xmath53 direction , reconnection will lead to a toroidal field ; in any case there is no `` easy '' direction with vortices moving outwards against drag forces only .",
    "we therefore assume that the toroidal field is confined to an equatorial belt surrounding but not overlapping with the core region with poloidal field lines ( here poloidal means a uniform parallel array of flux lines ) .",
    "the dominant physical process constraining the radial vortex current is creep against the torroidal flux lines .",
    "the radially outward vortex current will have its dynamics characterized by the _",
    "local _ values of the lag @xmath75 . in the region of toroidal flux lines the lag @xmath75 may have quite different values from the rest of the core .",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath182 vortex creep can operate in the linear or nonlinear regimes ( alpar , cheng & pines 89 ) , depending on a comparison of the spin down rate determined by the external torque and the efficiency of thermal creep , as reflected in the magnitude of the sinh function @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the characteristic spindown age of the pulsar . for the vela pulsar parameters , the estimate of the sinh is less than 1 if @xmath185 , or @xmath186 mev , if @xmath187k . in this case",
    "eq.([eq : creeptoroidal ] ) is linearized to give @xmath188 thus , in the linear regime creep across toroidal flux lines the relaxation times @xmath189 and @xmath190 are half the corresponding relaxation times @xmath191 and @xmath168 for creep across flux lines aligned in the @xmath53 direction .",
    "this is easy to understand since creep operates in the @xmath52 direction , that is , both @xmath53 and @xmath54 motions are allowed , while in the latter case creep takes place only in the @xmath54 direction .",
    "the relaxation time of the toroidal region has a sensitive dependence on @xmath192 : @xmath193 thus @xmath194 for @xmath195 , the limiting value for linear creep .",
    "if @xmath196 is somewhat smaller , the dynamical relaxation time is reduced exponentially ; for example @xmath197 s for @xmath198 .",
    "if flux lines of the proton superconductor are not taken into account , the dynamical relaxation time for the core superfluid is @xmath199 as given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tauvortp ] ) and ( [ eq : scaletauntau ] ) , employing the results of ( alpar , langer & sauls 1984 ) . the range of uncertainty corresponds to the uncertainty in the representative values of the effective proton mass in the neutron star core .",
    "we have found that the inclusion of the proton flux lines strengthens the coupling between the neutron superfluid in the core and the charged component of the star , leading to substantially shorter dynamical coupling times . when flux lines are included as absolute barriers in a poloidal like configuration",
    ", the neutron superfluid spins down by the outward motion of the vortex lines in the  easy \" direction , parallel to the flux lines , checked only by drag forces .",
    "the dynamical coupling time is reduced by the factor @xmath200 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath7 is the coefficient of the drag force and @xmath201 is the magnus inertial coefficient , yielding @xmath202 absolute pinning to poloidal flux lines forces the neutron superfluid into effective corotation with the charged component and outer crust of the neutron star .",
    "allowing vortex creep across the flux lines does not effect this conclusion . for relevant neutron star core temperatures and pinning energy estimates for flux line - vortex line junctions ,",
    "the timescale for creep across the flux lines is typically much longer than the timescale @xmath114 of dynamical coupling achieved by vortex motion parallel to the flux lines alone , so that the effective dynamical relaxation time with creep present is not changed , @xmath203 .",
    "thus the presence of flux lines reduces dynamical coupling times drastically and clamps the neutron star core superfluid to the crust and charged component .",
    "the likely toroidal arrangement of flux lines circumscribing the core superfluid does not allow any anisotropy in vortex flow .",
    "all vortices have to creep across the toroidal flux lines if they are to move out radially .",
    "if @xmath196 is small enough ( @xmath185 for vela pulsar parameters , with a similar critical value for other pulsars ) creep is linear , the dynamical relaxation time is simply the creep relaxation time @xmath204 s. the toroidal region may well contain values of the pinning energy with @xmath196 large enough for the nonlinear creep regime . in the nonlinear regime , corresponding , for the vela pulsar parameters , to @xmath205 , or @xmath206 mev , if @xmath207k , the sinh function is approximated with @xmath208 . the resulting highly nonlinear dynamical model has been successfully applied to the dynamics of the inner crust superfluid , and invoked to explain basic features of postglitch and interglitch response in pulsars ( alpar et al 1984b ) . with its location at the boundary between the neutron star core and superfluid inner crust , the region with toroidal flux lines could have a moment of inertia fraction @xmath209 , comparable to the fractional moment of inertia of the superfluid inner crust . the steady state lag @xmath210 and the relaxation times for nonlinear creep in the toroidal region",
    "may also be similar to the lag and relaxation times of the inner crust superfluid .",
    "the toroidal region will then have postglitch response signatures similar to those of the inner crust superfluid , and will be responsible for some of the nonlinear response previously attributed to the inner crust superfluid .",
    "this makes it impossible to draw unambiguous lower limits on the moment of inertia fraction of the inner crust superfluid to use for constraints on the neutron star structure and equation of state .",
    "nonlinear creep implies a much larger value of the steady state lag @xmath77 in the toroidal region than the typical lags in the linear regime , which we found to be extremely small in the neutron star core with its poloidal ( uniform ) array of flux lines .",
    "this change in @xmath75 means a sharp increase in @xmath10 , and therefore a large density of neutron vortex lines in the boundary between the core superfluid and the toroidal region .",
    "this may well be an axially symmetric vortex reservoir to provide the source of glitches when vortex lines are unpinned catastrophically .",
    "thus the toroidal region could become an alternative , or a complement to the inner crust superfluid as a source of glitches as well as being a prominent agent of postglitch relaxation ."
