    "the mapping of the energy of a magnetic solid calculated from first principles for different magnetic configurations onto a heisenberg hamiltonian is nowadays a widely used concept that allows a number of interesting subsequent investigations .",
    "an example for this is the determination of the curie temperature of a ferromagnet by means of monte carlo simulations using the calculated exchange coupling parameters @xmath3 as input ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 are indices labeling the individual atomic sites ) @xcite .",
    "apart from fitting the @xmath3 s to the total energies obtained for different magnetic configurations one can use the energies of spin spirals as basis for such a mapping @xcite . as an alternative one may use perturbation theory , that allow to calculate the @xmath3 s directly .",
    "in fact the expression derived by lichtenstein et al .",
    "@xcite within the frame work of non - relativistic multiple scattering theory is now successfully used for a wide range of materials @xcite .    initiated among others by investigations on the magnetic ground state configuration of nano - scale systems ,",
    "there is strongly growing interest in the interplay of exchange coupling and spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "besides the magnetic anisotropy energy , the spin - orbit coupling gives rise to an anisotropic exchange coupling .",
    "using again the above mentioned concept the isotropic exchange constants @xmath3 have to be replaced by a corresponding exchange coupling tensor @xmath0 . by generalising the approach of lichtenstein et al . to a fully relativistic formulation , udvardi et al .",
    "@xcite could derive corresponding expressions for the elements of @xmath0 .",
    "corresponding applications to thin films as well as to finite deposited clusters can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of the expressions worked out by udvardi et al .",
    "@xcite is that one has to use various magnetic configurations as a reference state to determine all elements of @xmath0 . in the following",
    "we present an alternative approach that can be derived in a rather transparent way and does not have that problem . as it is demonstrated both approaches",
    "give nevertheless results that are quite close to each other . as an application of our new scheme we present results for the exchange tensor @xmath0 in ferromagnetic crte and in the diluted magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) system ga@xmath1mn@xmath2as .",
    "the later will be discussed in relation to recent work of timm and macdonald @xcite who used a tight - binding description of the system in contrast to the ab - initio approach employed here that is based on local spin density approximation ( lsda ) .",
    "starting point of our derivation for @xmath0 is the expression for the change in energy @xmath6 of a system upon a perturbation taking place at sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "an expression for @xmath6 was worked out by several authors @xcite within the framework of multiple scattering theory and making use of lloyd s formula .",
    "the derivation of this expression can straight forwardly be applied when working in the framework of spin - polarised relativistic multiple scattering or kkr @xcite formalism . adopting the convention for the corresponding electronic green s function",

    "in contrast to this , the present approach allows us to evaluate the elements of the exchange coupling tensor ( in particular , its antisymmetric part representing the dm coupling ) on the basis of ab - initio electronic structure calculations .",

    ", this finding is in line with the results of timm and macdonald @xcite .",
    "obviously , the values for the dm coupling term can not be considered as negligibly small , and as a consequence one can not exclude a noticable non - collinear ferromagnetic order in the system . to clarify this question corresponding monte carlo simulations based on the calculated exchange tensor will be performed .",
    "a new scheme to calculate the exchange coupling tensor @xmath0 has been presented that is based on ab - initio electronic structure calculations using spin - polarized fully relativistic multiple scattering theory and spin density functional theory .",
    "application to ferromagnetic crte as well as to other systems demonstrates that the approach gives results for the exchange tensor elements very similar to those obtained using the approach of udvardi et al .",
