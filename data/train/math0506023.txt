    "in @xcite , khovanov introduced a graded cohomology theory for classical links and showed it yields the jones polynomial by taking the graded euler characteristic .",
    "this construction has sparked a good deal of interests in recent years . in @xcite ,",
    "a graded cohomology theory for graphs was constructed .",
    "the graded euler characteristic of the cohomology groups is the chromatic polynomial of the graph .",
    "both constructions in @xcite and in @xcite depend on a given graded algebra ( more precisely a frobenius algebra in the case of knots and links ) which is the building block for the chain groups in the chain complex .",
    "however , the amounts of choices of algebras are quite different . in the case of links ,",
    "the choices are quite limited due to invariance of redemeister moves . for the case of graphs ,",
    "the choices are abundant .",

    "the purpose of this note is to show the construction in @xcite can be made for any graded @xmath2-algebra that is finite dimensional in each degree , commutative , and whose product is degree preserving , i.e. @xmath3 for all homogeneous elements @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is an integral domain .    in section 2 , we explain the definition of the chain complex , and show that the euler characteristic of the cohomology groups is equal to the chromatic polynomial of the graph evaluated at @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the graded dimension of the algebra @xmath9 . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss some basic properties of our cohomology groups .",
    "in particular , we construct a long exact sequence which can be considered as a categorification of the deletion - contraction rule of the chromatic polynomial . in section 4 ,",

    "this is contrary to the cohomology groups in @xcite and in @xcite , where the computations suggest no odd torsion can occur @xcite .",
    "we also show some computations when the algebra has no grading , in which case @xmath10 is an integer .",
    "the euler characteristic of the cohomology groups is therefore an integer @xmath11 .",
    "this should probably be compared to the work of eastwood and huggett @xcite , who constructed , for each positive integer @xmath12 and each graph @xmath13 , a topological space @xmath14 whose euler characteristic is the integer @xmath15 .",
    "however , we do nt know if there is any connections between our work and theirs .",

    "( a ) . to prove this defines a chain complex ,",
    "we need to show that @xmath111 is a differential .",

    "each permutation of the edges of @xmath13 is a product of transpositions of the form @xmath116 .",
    "an explicit isomorphism can be constructed for each such transposition .",

    "next , we note that @xmath118 where @xmath64 is the number of connected components of @xmath24 $ ] . taking direct sum over @xmath119 , and then taking alternating sum over @xmath120",

    "for each @xmath37 we have a chain complex    @xmath123    the direct sum of these chain complexes , with the obvious gradings , is equal to the chain complex in theorem [ chain complex ] .",
    "\\(b ) our chain complexes can also be described in terms of enhanced states .",
    "one defines an _ enhanced state _",
    "@xmath124 of @xmath13 to be a pair @xmath125 where @xmath23 and @xmath126 is an assignment of an element of @xmath9 to each connected component of @xmath24 $ ] .",

    "when each @xmath131 is a homogeneous element of @xmath9 , we say the coloring @xmath126 and the enhanced state @xmath124 are homogeneous , and we define its degree to be @xmath132 .",

    "some variations can be introduced in our construction .",
    "\\(a ) as we discussed in 2.2 , our coefficient ring @xmath44 can be replaced by any integral domain @xmath2 , i.e. a commutative ring with @xmath137 and no zero divisors . by analogy with the abelian group case ,",

    "using @xmath142 as the building block for our chain @xmath2-modules ( the counterpart of the chain groups in the @xmath2-module case ) , the same construction can still be made and @xmath143 where the graded dimension of @xmath142 is obviously defined to be the power series @xmath144 .    the proof that @xmath145 is the same as in the abelian case",
    ", we just need to prove the counterpart in the @xmath2-module category of a well known result for abelian groups .",
    "namely , it is enough to show that if @xmath146 is an exact sequence of @xmath2-modules , then @xmath147 .",
    "this is true because the quotient field of an integral domain @xmath2 is a flat @xmath2-module ( @xcite , p86 ) . hence taking the tensor product of the exact sequence @xmath148 by @xmath139 yields an exact sequence of @xmath2-modules that turns out to be an exact sequence of @xmath139-vector spaces and the result follows .",
    "some properties , e.g. the result ( [ summand ] ) on pendant edge in the next section , can be extended to the case when @xmath6 is a principal idea domain .",
    "\\(b ) we can define a twisted version of the differential map @xmath111 as follows .",
    "let @xmath149 be a degree preserving homomorphism of the algebra @xmath9 .",
    "that is , @xmath150 is linear , @xmath151 for all @xmath152 , and @xmath153 for all homogeneous elements @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath73 be an edge of the cube we had before .",

    "if @xmath150 is the identity map , this is the same as our construction above .",
    "otherwise , the constructions can be different .",

    "thus @xmath163 which are nontrivial for @xmath164 . on the other hand , the ( untwisted ) cohomology groups all vanishes when @xmath13 has a loop ( see corollary [ loops ] in the next section ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss some basic properties of the cohomology groups .",
    "most of these are parallel to the case when the algebra is @xmath1/(x^2)$}}$ ] whose discussion was given in @xcite .",
    "the most interesting property is a long exact sequence , which can be considered as a categorification for the deletion - contraction rule for the chromatic polynomial .",
    "+      the long exact sequence comes from a short exact sequence of graded chain homomorphisms    @xmath165 which we explain here .",
    "basically @xmath55 is the map that recovers the edge @xmath89 , and @xmath166 is the projection map that kills every state containing @xmath89 .",
    "a more precise description is given below .",
    "first , we order the edges of @xmath13 so that @xmath89 is the last edge .",
    "this induces natural orderings on the edge sets of @xmath167 and @xmath168 by deleting @xmath89 from the list . for each @xmath169 , let @xmath170 . then @xmath171 .",

    "the components of @xmath174 $ ] and the components of @xmath175 $ ] are the same except for the one involving @xmath89 in which case they are related by a contraction of @xmath89 .",
    "thus we have @xmath176 via a natural isomorphism , since the tensor factors naturally correspond to each other .",
    "let @xmath177 be this isomorphism . taking direct sum over @xmath25",

    "we have @xmath180 .",
    "if @xmath181 , @xmath25 is automatically a subset of @xmath182 .",
    "we have @xmath183 since the graphs @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath184 $ ] are identical .",

    "if @xmath187 , we let @xmath188 be the zero map .",

    "a standard diagram chasing argument shows that this defines a short exact sequence of chain complexes .",

    "+ ( a ) for each @xmath120 , there is a short exact sequence of graded chain homomorphisms : @xmath190 , and therefore by the zig - zag lemma , + ( b ) it induces a long exact sequence of cohomology groups : @xmath191 +    taking the alternating sum of the graded dimensions in the above long exact sequence , we obtain the deletion - contraction rule .",
    "it is in this sense that the long exact sequence is considered as a categorification of the deletion - contraction rule .",
    "it is useful to understand the following geometric description of the maps @xmath192 and @xmath193 : @xmath194 expands the edge @xmath89 and keeps in the same coloring , @xmath195 is the projection map that kills every state containing @xmath89 . for @xmath196 ,",
