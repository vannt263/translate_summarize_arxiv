    "the investigation of nonlinear ( with respect to the input power ) effects in the absorption of piezoelectrically active ultrasonic waves , arising due to the interaction of the waves with three- dimensional electron gas ( in the case of boltzmann statistics ) , has shown that the mechanisms of the nonlinearity depend on the state of the electrons .",
    "if electrons are free ( delocalized ) , then the nonlinearity mechanism for moderately high sound intensities is usually due to the heating of the electrons in the electric field of an ultrasonic wave .",
    "the character of the heating depends on the quantity @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the sound frequency , and @xmath11 is the energy relaxation time .",
    "if the electrons are localized , then the nonlinearity mechanism is due to the character of the localization ( on an individual impurity or in the wells of a fluctuation potential ) . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that in the case where the electrons are localized on individual impurities , the nonlinearity was determined by impurity breakdown in the electric field of the sound wave .",
    "when the electrons occupied the conduction band as a result of this effect , their temperature started to grow as a result of heating in the electric field of the wave @xcite .",
    "the study of structures with a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) opens up a unique possibility of studying in one series of measurements performed on the same sample the mechanisms of nonlinearity in delocalized and localized electron states , since under quantum hall effect conditions both states are realized by varying the magnetic field .",
    "the change in the absorption coefficient for a piezoelectrically active surface acoustic wave ( saw ) interactimg with a 2deg as a function of the saw intensity in gaas / algaas structures was previously observed in @xcite and @xcite only in the magnetic field range corresponding to small integer filling numbers - the quantum hall effect regime , when the two - dimensional electrons are localized . the authors explained the data which they obtained by heating of a 2deg .    in the present paper",
    "we report some of our investigations concerning nonlinear effects accompanying the interaction of delocalized two- dimensional electrons with the electric field of a saw for the purpose of investigating nonlinearity mechanisms .",
    "we investigated the absorption coefficient for a 30 - 210 mhz saw in a two - dimensional electron gas in @xmath12 heterostructures as a function of the temperature in the range @xmath13 in the linear regime ( the input power did not exceed @xmath14w ) and the saw power at @xmath15 in magnetic fields up to 30 koe .",
    "samples studied previously in @xcite with hall density @xmath16 and mobility @xmath17 at t=4.2 k were used for the investigations .",
    "the technology used to fabricate the heterostructures is described in @xcite and the procedure for performing the sound absorption experiment is described in @xcite . here we only note that the experimental structure with 2deg was located on the surface of the piezodielectric ( lithium niobate @xmath18 ) , along which the saw propagates .",
    "the saw was excited in a pulsed regime by sending radio pulses with filling frequency 30- 210 mhz from an rf oscillator into the excited interdigital transducer .",
    "the pulse duration was of the order of 1@xmath19 is and the pulse repetition frequency was equal to 50 hz . in the present paper",
    "the saw power is the power in a pulse .    an ac electric field with the frequency of the saw , which accompanies the deformation wave , penetrates into a channel containing two- dimensional electrons , giving rise to electrical currents and , correspondingly , joule losses .",
    "as a result of this interaction , energy is absorbed from the wave .",
    "the saw absorption in a magnetic field is measured in the experiment . since the measured absorption is determined by the conductivity of the 2deg , quantization of the electronic spectrum , which leads to shubnikov - de haas oscillations ,",
    "gives rise to oscillations in the saw potential as well .",
    "curves of the absorption coefficient @xmath20 versus the magnetic field @xmath21 are presented in fig.1 for different temperatures and powers of the 30-mhz saw .",
    "similar curves were also obtained for other saw frequencies .",
    "the character of the curves @xmath22 is analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the absorption maxima @xmath23 as a function of the magnetic field for @xmath24koe are equally spaced as a function of @xmath25 , and the splitting of the maxima @xmath26 for @xmath27 koe into two peaks with the values of @xmath28 at the maxima do not depend on the conductivity of the 2deg , and that they are determined , within the limits of the experimental error , only by the saw characteristics and the gap between the sample and @xmath18 ] is due to the relaxational character of the absorption .",
    "the temperature and saw power dependences of @xmath20 , shown in figs . 2 and 3 ,",
    "were extracted from the experimental curves of the same type as in fig.1 for the corresponding frequencies in a magnetic field @xmath24koe for large filling numbers @xmath30 .",
    "figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the quantity @xmath31 measured in the linear regime at a frequency of 150 mhz in different magnetic fields . here",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath32 are the values of @xmath20 on the upper and lower lines , which envelop the oscillatory dependence @xmath26 for @xmath24koe .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath33 versus @xmath34-the power of the saw ( frequency 150 mhz ) at the oscillator output at @xmath35=1.5k .",
    "we see from figs .",
    "2 and 3 that @xmath33 decreases with increasing temperature and with increasing saw power .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that in the range of magnetic fields where the quantum hall effect is still not observed ( in our case @xmath24 koe ) the dissipative conductivities are    @xmath36 ,    where @xmath37 is the conductivity calculated from the measured dc resistivities @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the conductivity found from the absorption coefficient @xmath26 measured in the linear regime .",
    "this result gave us the basis for assuming that in this range of magnetic fields the electrons are in a delocalized state .",
    "as we have already indicated in the introduction , we shall analyze here nonlinearity only in this case .    in a previous work @xcite we showed that if the electrons are delocalized , then the characteristics of the 2deg , such as the carrier density @xmath41 , the transport relaxation time @xmath42 , and the quantum which is inversely proportional to the almost total scattering cross section @xcite . in experiments on quantum oscillations",
    "it is defined as time @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the dingle temperature . ]",
    "relaxation time , can be determined from the magnetic field dependences @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , the mobility @xmath46 and the concentration @xmath41 at @xmath47 are close to the values obtained from dc measurements : the hall density and mobility of the electrons , as well as @xmath41 found from the shubnikov - de haas oscillations .",
    "for this reason , it was natural to assume that @xmath20 depends on the saw power , just as in the static case , because of the heating of the 2deg but in the electric field of the saw .",
    "the heating of the 2deg in a static electric field in similar heterostructures was investigated in @xcite . in those papers",
    "it was shown that at liquid - helium temperatures the electron energy relaxation processes are determined in a wide range of 2deg densities by the piezoacoustic electron - phonon interaction under small - angle scattering and weak screening conditions .",
    "we shall employ , by analogy with @xcite , the concept of the temperature @xmath0 of two- dimensional electrons and determine it by comparing the curves of the absorption coefficient @xmath20 versus the saw power with the curves of @xmath20 versus the lattice temperature @xmath35 .",
    "such a comparison makes it possible to establish a correspondence between the temperature of the two- dimensional electrons and the output power of the oscillator .",
    "the values of @xmath0 were extracted by two methods : 1 ) by comparing the curves of the amplitude of the oscillations @xmath31 versus the temperature @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "2 ) and versus the power @xmath34 ( fig .",
    "3 ) for the same value of the magnetic field @xmath21 ; 2 ) by comparing curves of the ratios @xmath48 and @xmath49 versus the lattice temperature @xmath35 and the power @xmath34 . here",
    "the values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 were also taken for the same value of @xmath21 , and @xmath28 is the absorption at @xmath21=28 koe ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the use of the ratios instead of the absolute values of @xmath20 decreased the effect of the experimental variance in @xmath20 on the error in determining @xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "the accuracy in determining @xmath0 by these two methods was no worse than @xmath52 .    to determine the absolute energy losses as a result of absorption of saw in the case of interaction with electrons ( @xmath53 ) , the following calculations must be performed .",
    "the intensity @xmath54 of the electric field , in which the two - dimensional electrons of the heterostructure are located during the propagation of a saw in a piezoelectric material placed at a distance @xmath55 from a high - conductivity channel , is    @xmath56 ^ 2}w,\\label{eq:1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 is the electromechanical coupling constant ; @xmath58 cm / s and @xmath59 are , respectively , the velocity and wave number of sound in @xmath18 ; @xmath55 is the width of the vacuum gap between the sample and the @xmath18 plate ; @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the permittivities of free space , @xmath18 , and the semiconductor with the 2deg , respectively ; and @xmath63 is the input saw power scaled to the width of the sound track .",

    ", we obtain @xmath69 , where @xmath20 is the absorption measured in the experiment .",
    "the power @xmath63 at the entrance to the sample is not measured very accurately in acoustic measurements .",
    "the problem is that this quantity is determined by , first , the quality of the interdigital transducers ; second , by the losses associated with the mismatch of the line that feeds electric power into the transmitting transducer as well as the line that re moves electrical power from the detecting transducer , where the losses in the receiving and transmitting parts of the line may not be the same ; and , third , by absorption of the saw in the substrate , whose absolute magnitude is difficult to measure in our experiment . the effect of these losses de creases with frequency , so that in determining @xmath63 at 30 mhz we assumed that both the conversion losses for the transmitting and receiving transducers as well as the losses in th transmitting and receiving lines are identical .",
    "the total losses were found to be @xmath70=16 db , if saw absorption in the heterostructure substrate is ignored . if it is assumed that nonlinear effects at 150 mhz start at the same value of @xmath53 as a 30 mhz , then the `` threshold '' value of @xmath53 at which the deviation of @xmath71 at 30 mhz from a constant value be comes appreciable [ we recall that @xmath72 in the region of delocalized electronic states , i.e. , @xmath7325 koe @xcite ] can be used to determine the total losses at 150 mhz .",
    "an estimate of the total losses by this method at 150 mhz give ; @xmath70=18 db .",
    "therefore , the power @xmath63 at the entrance to the sample is determined by the output power @xmath34 of the oscillator taking into account the total losses @xmath70 .    with the results of @xcite in mind",
    ", we constructed the curves    @xmath74    which correspond to the energy balance equation in the cast of the interaction of electrons with the piezoelectric potential of the acoustic phonons ( pa scattering ) under the condition of weak screening at frequencies of 30 and 150 mhz in different magnetic fields    @xmath75    but since the condition for weak screening was not satisfied for this sample , the curves @xmath76 , corresponding to the energy balance equation in the case of pa scattering but with the condition of strong screening for the same frequencies 30 and 150 mhz and the same magnetic fields , were also constructed :    @xmath77    a least - squares analysis showed that the expression ( 3 ) gives a better description of the experimental curves .",
    "figure 4 shows the experimental points and theoretical curves of the expressions of the type ( 3 ) with @xmath78 and @xmath1=30 mhz , where @xmath1 is the saw frequency ( see curve @xmath79 in fig.4 ) , and @xmath80 and @xmath1=150 mhz ( see curve @xmath81 in fig .",
    "to describe the heating of an electron gas by means of a temperature @xmath0 different from the lattice temperature @xmath35 , the electron - electron collisions must occur more often than collisions with the lattice ; i.e. , the condition @xmath82 , must be satisfied . here",

    "4 ) and the ratio ( 31 ) of the temperatures presented above allows us to assert that in the case of heating of two- dimensional electrons by the electric field of a saw ( @xmath1=30 and 150 mhz ) the electron energy relaxation is determined by pa scattering with strong screening ( 13 ) , which for the parameters employed by us gives the theoretical relation ( 29 ) .    at the same time , as noted above , in the investigation in the static regime [ with phonon temperature @xmath222 @xcite , i.e. the inequalities ( 31 ) hold ] , the law ( 2 ) with @xmath213 was observed , indicating that pa scattering dominates in the electron energy relaxation mechanisms in the case of weak screening ( 8) . besides the indicated discrepancy between the results of investigations of the heating of a 2deg in high- frequency ( rf ) and dc electric fields , it should be noted that there is also a discrepancy in the experimental values @xmath223 at @xmath1=30mhz and values @xmath224 at @xmath1=150 mhz ( see sec.iii ) . in addition , these values are not greater than ( as the experimental value of @xmath195 is the static regime ) but less than the theoretical value values @xmath223 - eq .",

    "since the calculations in @xcite were performed for a constant electric field , they obviously can not explain the above - noted discrepancies , especially the difference in the functions @xmath225 at different frequencies .",
    "apparently , the difference is due to the different values of @xmath144 with respect to 1 . taking into consideration the approximate nature of the computed parameters and the uncertainty in the input power in our measurements",
    ", we took as the value of the energy relaxation time @xmath11 estimated from the theoretical value @xmath226 with @xmath175 ( 29 ) , which gives in the case of a calculation based on eq .",

    "@xmath228 mhz @xmath229 and at @xmath230mhz @xmath231 , which leads to a different heating for the same energy losses . in this connection",
    ", we attempted to study this question theoretically ( see sec.iv.b ) and to compare the results obtained with experiment . as a result",
    ", we can demonstrate the validity of eq .",

    "we present in the inset in fig .",
    "4 the experimental values of the difference @xmath232 as a function of @xmath2 for two frequencies , 30 and 150 mhz , in a field @xmath233 koe . we see from the figure that in accordance with eq . (",

    "a similar result was also obtained for @xmath237 in the magnetic field @xmath240 koe .",
    "therefore , experiment confirms the theoretical conclusion that for @xmath5 the energy losses depend on @xmath144 .",
    "it should be noted that in determining @xmath2 at @xmath241150 mhz it was assumed that @xmath242 $ ] is frequency- independent ( see sec.iii ) , which is at variance with the result presented above .",
    "however , @xmath2 and @xmath243 are so small at the onset of the nonlinear effects that their differences at different frequencies fall within the limits of error of our measurements .",
    "as one can see from the theory ( see sec .",
    "iv.b ) , an analytical expression could not be obtained in the case of strong heating of a 2deg in an rf electric field of a saw , but it can be assumed that , by analogy with the case of weak heating , the difference in the coefficients @xmath135 remains also in the case of heating up to @xmath244 .    a more accurate numerical development of the theory of heating of a 2deg for arbitrary values of @xmath144 from @xmath245 up to @xmath246 , including in the transitional regions @xmath247 and",

    "in our study we observed heating of a 2deg by a rf electric field generated by a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) . the heating could be described by an electron temperature @xmath0 , exceeding the lattice temperature @xmath35 .",
    "it was shown that the experimental dependences of the energy losses @xmath2 on @xmath0 at different saw frequencies depend on the value of @xmath144 with respect to @xmath79 , where @xmath11 is the energy relaxation time of two - dimensional electrons .",
