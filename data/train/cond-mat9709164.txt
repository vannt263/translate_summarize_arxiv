    "we first consider the effects of weak random fields on the properties of the pure system .",
    "these are quite innocuous deep in the paramagnetic phase when the transverse field wins over both the randomness and the exchange interaction .",
    "so we will turn immediately to the ordered phase and the critical point .",
    "it is easy to see using the imry - ma@xcite argument that for dimension @xmath0 , the ordered phase of the quantum model is stable to a weakly random @xmath6 .",
    "imagine that in the absence of randomness , the system is deep in the ordered phase .",
    "the stability to a weak random field is determined by balancing the energy cost to form large - sized domains with the typical energy gain because of the random @xmath6 .",
    "deep in the ordered phase , the energy cost of a domain @xmath21 while the typical energy gain due to the random field @xmath22 exactly as in the classical problem .",
    "thus for @xmath0 , for weak enough random fields , it is not favourable to form large - sized domains and the system stays ordered .",
    "we expect of course that strong randomness will destroy the ordered phase in any dimension . precisely in @xmath23 , as in the classical problem , the system is marginally unstable and there is no ordered phase .",
    "now , assume that we are at the critical point of the pure system in @xmath24 .",
    "when are weak random fields a relevant perturbation at this critical fixed point ?",
    "this can be answered as follows .",
    "consider the continuum action eqn .",
    "[ action ] .",
    "averaging over the disorder using replicas gives the term @xmath25 .",
    "now under the renormaliation group transformation appropriate to the critical fixed point of the pure system @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "this gives @xmath29 .",
    "clearly then @xmath19 is always relevant .",
    "in this section , we will present the reasoning behind our assumption that the fixed point controlling the transition has no quantum fluctuations@xcite .    for _",
    "classical _ random field magnets , it is believed@xcite that the properties of the finite temperature phase transition ( which exists for @xmath0 ) are controlled by a zero temperature fixed point . the first evidence for this belief came from perturbative studies@xcite of a continuum field theoretic description of the magnet near the critical point . order by order in perturbation theory , it can be shown that the effects of the fluctuations introduced by the randomness dominate over the effects of the thermal fluctuations near the critical point .",
    "this is interpreted in renormalization group language to be a manifestation of a zero - temperature fixed point with ( dangerously ) irrelevant thermal fluctuations .",
    "though many of the predictions of this perturbative analysis are believed not to be correct for realistic dimensions ( @xmath30,@xmath31 ) , there is a general consensus that the critical fixed point is fluctuationless in all dimensions where there is a transition .",
    "this is further supported by heuristic renormalization group arguments valid in @xmath32@xcite , numerical real space renormalization calculations@xcite , and general agreement of some of the phenomenology suggested by such fluctuation - less fixed points with experiments in @xmath33@xcite .    for the quantum random field magnets that we are considering here , a similar perturbative analysis , valid in high dimension , of a continuum field theory expected to describe the correct @xmath34 critical behaviour",
    "was undertaken several years ago by two groups@xcite(see also section  [ epsilon ] ) .",
    "again it was found that order by order in perturbation theory , the effects of fluctuations introduced by the randomness dominated the effects of quantum fluctuations .",
    "we take this to be strong evidence that the fixed point is fluctuationless for every dimension ( @xmath24 ) for the quantum problem as well .",
    "now consider the finite temperature phase transition in the quantum model which occurs when the ground state is ordered .",
    "this transition is , of course , in the same universality class as that in the _ classical _ models discussed earlier .",
    "it is clear that this is controlled by the same fixed point that controls the quantum transition .",
    "thus , we have the unusual situation that the same fixed point controls both the @xmath34 and @xmath35 transitions .",
    "the phase diagram and rg flows ( for @xmath24 ) are shown in figure  [ rfield ] .",
    "a number of results follow from the claim that the same fixed point controls both the classical and quantum transitions . first , on approaching the transition from the ordered phase , the magnetization vanishes with an exponent @xmath37 which is the same as for the classical transition .",
    "next consider correlation functions .",
    "as in the classical problem , there are two different correlation functions that can be defined : the correlation function @xmath38 where the angular brackets denote averaging over quantum fluctuations and the overline denotes averaging over the randomness . as the randomness is independant of time , the system is translationally invariant in time in every sample .",
    "therefore @xmath39 is independant of @xmath40 and we will refer to it as @xmath41 from now on . after averaging over the disorder , spatial translational invariance is also restored in the correlation function , and so @xmath42 .",
    "this satisfies ( near the transition ) @xmath43 where the correlation length @xmath44 . the scaling function @xmath45 and",
    "the exponents @xmath46 , @xmath47 are properties of the fixed point theory and its relevant perturbations ( the deviation from the critical randomness strength ) . as these are the same for both the quantum and classical transitions , we get the result that the exponents @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the function @xmath45 are identical to their classical counterparts .",
    "the connected correlation function @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the time - ordering symbol .",
    "clearly @xmath50 .",
    "note that this correlation function vanishes at the fixed point ( as there are no quantum fluctuations at the fixed point ) .",
    "thus to obtain its critical behaviour , we need to keep the irrelevant quantum fluctuations .",
    "similarly for the corresponding classical problem , it is necessary to keep the irrelevant thermal fluctuations .",
    "as these two irrelevant perturbations may have quite different effects , in general , we _ do not _ expect @xmath51 to scale identically to the classical space and time dependant correlation function .",
    "however it is possible to argue that the _ static _",
    "correlation function of the quantum problem scales identically to the _ equal - time _ correlation function of the classical problem .",
    "this was first noticed within the @xmath52 expansion by boyanovsky and cardy@xcite , but as we show below is more generally valid ( though other results of the @xmath52 expansion are not ) .",
    "consider the susceptibility@xciteof the model to an external spatially varying static magnetic field @xmath53 . clearly for both the quantum and classical problems , the scaling of this susceptibility near the transition is just determined by minimizing the classical fixed - point hamiltonian in the presence of the external field .",
    "hence the static ( non - local ) susceptibilility scales identically for the classical and quantum problems .",
    "now at any finite @xmath35 in the classical problem , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem implies that the equal - time correlation function is proportional to the susceptibility .",
    "similarly , the static correlation function of the quantum problem is also proportional to its susceptibility .",
    "thus these two correlation functions scale identically .",
    "we then have the result @xmath54 with @xmath55 and the scaling function @xmath56 being identical to those for the connected equal - time correlation functions of the classical problem .",
    "the equal - time correlation function in the quantum problem will however scale differently .",
    "we now turn to dynamical correlations . for the classical transition , villain and",
    "fisher@xcite have presented arguments to show that the dynamical scaling is unconventional , with the logarithm of the characteristic relaxation times scaling as a power of the length scales .",
    "similar unconventional dynamic scaling also occurs in the vicinity of the random _ quantum _ transitions studied recently@xcite , all of which are controlled by fluctuation - less fixed points .",
    "we suggest below that the dynamic scaling is activated at this quantum transition as well .",
    "the argument for the dynamic scaling closely follows that for the classical case .",
    "consider a block of the system of size @xmath57 near the critical system .",
    "ignoring quantum fluctuations , the energy landscape as a function of the total magnetization of the block has been argued to scale as @xmath58@xcite .",
    "most blocks would thus have a single deep global minimum at some non - zero value of the magnetization .",
    "the energy of this minimum will differ from those of other local mimima by amounts @xmath59 .",
    "the barriers separating these different local mimima also scale as @xmath58 .",
    "effects of quantum fluctuations on such blocks should be rather small , and do not contribute significantly to the dynamics .",
    "however , there would be some rare blocks in which there are two minima with an energy separation which is nearly zero .",
    "the dynamics at long time scales will be dominated by quantum tunnelling between such minima in these rare blocks .",
    "as the barrier between these minima rises as a power of @xmath60 , it is natural that the tunneling time @xmath61 with @xmath62 a new exponent .",
    "( this quantum tunneling will be important so long as the energy difference between the two minima is roughly less than @xmath63 ) .",
    "thus the dynamics is activated like in the other random quantum transitions studied in refs  @xcite .",
    "this therefore motivates the following scaling form for the imaginary part of the @xmath64 dependant susceptibility ( which is the spectral density for the connected correlator introduced above ) : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a microscopic time scale .",
    "the exponent @xmath67 will be related to other exponents below .",
    "the real part of the susceptibility may be obtained by the kramers - kronig relation : @xmath68 following pytte and imry@xcite , we write @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    ". then @xmath71\\ ] ] in the scaling limit when @xmath72 , we may approximate @xmath73 thus @xmath74 thus we get the following scaling form for the real part : @xmath75 with @xmath76",
    ". in particular , the _ static _ susceptibility @xmath77 thus we identify @xmath78 . note that similar scaling forms apply for the dynamics near the classical transition as well , although with a different value for @xmath62 and a different scaling function @xmath79 .",
    "nevertheless , as we argued earlier the function @xmath80 should be the same for the quantum and classical transitions .",
    "as shown below , the upper critical dimension of this model is @xmath1 .",
    "it is natural to try an expansion in powers of @xmath81 .",
    "this was done long back by aharony , gefen and shapir@xcite and by boyanovsky and cardy@xcite . here",
    ", we will review their results and discuss them in the context of the general scaling hypotheses of the previous section .",
    "the @xmath52 expansion is done using the continuum action eqn .",
    "[ action ] .",
    "it is instructive to set up the renormalization group so that @xmath16 is allowed to flow while keeping the strength of the randomness fixed . in particular , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite show that @xmath16 flows to zero at the critical fixed point . when @xmath82 , the partition function is determined by the particular configuration @xmath83 that minimizes the action .",
    "clearly the minimum action configuration is static . thus solving the fixed point theory simply corresponds to finding the static configuraion @xmath84 that minimizes the potential energy terms in the action .",
    "thus the fixed point theory is entirely classical .",
    "first consider the gaussian theory with @xmath85 .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be easily calculated .",
    "the result is : @xmath88 the critical point is at @xmath89 .",
    "the correlation functions introduced in the previous section are seen to scale as @xmath90 with the correlation length @xmath91 .",
    "thus , in the gaussian theory , we have @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "note that for the classical problem also , the gaussian exponents are @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "this is a trivial illustration of the general point made in the previous section .",
    "the dynamic scaling is however conventional in the gaussian theory .",
    "now consider a momentum shell renormalization group transformation on the gaussian action .",
    "it is convenient to let @xmath16 flow and keep the strength @xmath19 of the random field fixed .",
    "the flow equations for @xmath16 and @xmath98 are readily seen to be @xmath99 thus even in the gaussian theory , @xmath16 flows to @xmath14 at the fixed point which is hence fluctuationless .",
    "the tree - level flow equation for @xmath100 at the gaussian fixed point is just obtained by power - counting and is @xmath101 thus interaction effects are irrelevant above @xmath1 spatial dimensions and the gaussian theory gives the true critical behaviour . for @xmath9 below @xmath1 ,",
    "it is possible to construct an expansion in powers of @xmath81@xcite . to leading order ,",
    "the one loop rg equations are : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the high - momentum cutoff and @xmath104 .",
    "( @xmath105 is the surface area of a unit sphere in @xmath9 dimensions ) . again",
    "@xmath16 flows to @xmath14 at the fixed point . setting @xmath106 in the remaining equations",
    "it is clear that there is a non - trivial fixed point at @xmath107 .",
    "the flows can be linearized around this fixed point and give , for instance , @xmath108 to first order in @xmath52 .",
    "note that this is the same as for the pure problem in @xmath109 dimensions .",
    "this is a general feature of the @xmath52 expansion - all the exponents characterizing static critical properties in @xmath9 dimensions are the same as the pure problem in @xmath110 dimensions .",
    "this result however is an artifact of the @xmath52 expansion and is not true in all dimensions .",
    "the fact that @xmath16 flows to @xmath14 to this order means that the new non - gaussian fixed point is also fluctuationless .",
    "in fact the flow equation for @xmath16 has been shown to be exact to all orders in @xmath52@xcite . thus at least within the @xmath52 expansion , the fixed point is fluctuationless in any dimension .",
    "it was argued by boyanovsky and cardy that all the exponents and scaling functions associated with static critical properties of the quantum transition were the same as for the classical transition . as we have seen in the previous section ,",
    "this result is true quite generally .",
    "however dynamic properties ( for instance time - dependant correlation functions ) were shown to scale differently . within the @xmath52 expansion , they found that the dynamic scaling is conventional at both transitions with @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "thus , as in the classical case , the @xmath52 expansion is qualitatively incorrect to describe many aspects of the critical behaviour of the random field quantum system well below the upper critical dimension",
    ". nevertheless the @xmath52 expansion provides useful evidence for the claim that the fixed point has no quantum fluctuations .",
    "what we have done in this paper is primarily to update the theory of the quantum random field models since the pioneering papers in ref.@xcite , to take into account subsequent develoments in the understanding of the classical problem .",
    "our main assumption , motivated by the results of ref.@xcite , was that the quantum transition in any dimension is controlled by a fluctuationless fixed point that also controls the classical finite temperature transition .",
    "some of the consequences of this assumption were then examined .",
    "the static critical properties of the quantum transition are _ identical _ to those of the classical transition .",
    "the dynamics ( which depends on the irrelevant quantum / thermal fluctuations ) is similar , though not identical . in particular",
    ", we suggested that the dynamic scaling is of the activated form , with the length scales depending logarithmically on time scales .",
    "we have however not provided calculational evidence for this suggestion .",
    "evidence for the activated dynamic scaling can not be obtained from the @xmath52 expansion ( or from other perturbative approaches like a @xmath113 expansion ) . even for the classical transition ,",
    "the only available evidence comes from numerical calculations@xcite and agreement with the phenomenology seen in experiments@xcite . here",
    ", we have argued that activated dynamics in the quantum case is natural if it occurs in the classical problem .",
    "we may therefore regard support for activated dynamics in the classical transition as some sort of support for it happening in the quantum transition as well .",
    "there are some other important questions that are left open . for most of the paper ,",
    "we have focused on the critical point . the paramagnetic phase should be interesting to study by itself .",
    "in particular , is there a finite gap all the way till the critical point , or is there a griffiths - phase with gapless excitations in the vicinity of the critical point ?",
    "it is possible to show@xcite for the quantum version of a special model introduced by grinstein and mukamel@xcite in @xmath114 that the spin - autocorelation in imaginary time has a stretched exponential form @xmath115 .",
    "this implies gapless excitations with an essential singularity at zero energy in the local density of states . for more realistic models",
    "however , even in @xmath114 , the autocorrelation presumably decays exponentially .",
    "the general situation is unclear .",
    "similar questions can also be asked about griffiths effects for the uniform susceptibility in the paramagnetic phase .",

    "this was finally resolved , in favor of the imry - ma prediction , by a rigorous proof by imbrie@xcite that the @xmath116 classical random field ising model is ordered for sufficiently weak randomness .",
    "it is in principle possible that the susceptibility to a _ uniform _ external field is divergent in the vicinity of the transition ( as happens in a griffiths phase ) thereby invalidating linear response theory .",
