    "the standard model ( sm ) has been a cornerstone of modern - day particle physics .",
    "although during the past three decades it has passed all experimental tests , nevertheless there are many open questions remaining to be answered .",
    "we have yet to understand  ( i ) the mechanism of electro - weak symmetry breaking , and find the higgs boson which might be responsible for this breaking ; ( ii ) the quantized fermion charges ( why the up and down quarks have charges @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively ) and the weak mixing angle ( why it is 0.23 ) ; ( iii ) the 3 replicas of quarks and leptons , the observed fermion mass hierarchy , and the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix and its leptonic cousin .",
    "we ought to understand these problems from more fundamental principles , rather than simply take various charges , masses , mixing angles and cp phases as input parameters as in the sm . addressing these questions may eventually lead us to a more fundamental theory such as string theory at high energy scales .",
    "string theory @xcite is a leading candidate for a consistent theory of quantum gravity .",
    "it has a rich structure and many believe it can easily accommodate the sm as a subset .",
    "moreover there have been many attempts in the past to construct supersymmetric generalizations of the sm ( which will be loosely referred to as the minimal supersymmetric standard model , or the mssm ) or grand unified theories ( guts ) from the heterotic string @xcite and superstrings @xcite .",
    "partially successful results have been obtained .",
    "for example , many string theoretical models can explain the existence of three chiral families at low energy scales @xcite , and in principle can also provide a natural framework for understanding the fermion masses and mixings @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we construct a new class of three - family models in the heterotic string theory .    before presenting our models , it is important to note some caveats common to all known string models .",
    "they are due to two main difficulties facing the string theoretical model constructions .",
    "the first difficulty concerns the compactification of the string itself , i.e. the mechanism by which the desirable string vacuum is selected .",
    "the vacua of string theory compactifications are parameterized by many scalar fields with flat potentials .",
    "these fields are the modulus fields .",
    "they characterize the sizes and shapes of the compactified spaces and the strengths of the string interactions ; none of them can be fixed in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the modulus problem and the related issue of supersymmetry breaking will not be dealt with in this article , instead we will simply assume that the moduli are fixed by some unknown mechanism at the string scale .",
    "the second difficulty concerns our ignorance of the physics between the electro - weak and unification scales . except for some indication that the sm gauge couplings may unify at about @xmath10 gev in certain supersymmetric extensions of the sm with minimal matter content @xcite",
    ", we can hardly have any confidence in extrapolating the low energy data by some @xmath11 to @xmath12 orders of magnitude to the unification scale and infer what the gauge symmetries , matter spectra and physical parameters are at that scale . hence",
    ", we are far from having a clear - cut field theoretical model at the unification scale to which a string - derived model is supposed to match .",
    "any string construction must combine both bottom - up and top - down analyses .    the new class of string models in this paper are mainly motivated by the recent discussions on orbifold gut models @xcite .",
    "these gut models utilize properties of higher - dimensional field theories , and have some advantages over conventional 4d guts .",
    "for example , gut symmetry breaking can be accomplished by an orbifold parity , instead of by a complicated higgs sector .",
    "the doublet - triplet splitting problem , which plagues conventional guts , can also be solved by assigning appropriate orbifold parities to the doublet and triplet higgs bosons .",
    "note , however , that like all field theoretical models in higher dimensions , these gut models are not renormalizable quantum field theories .",
    "they can only make sense as low - energy effective theories of some more fundamental theory with better ultra - violet ( uv ) behavior .",
    "our string models provide exactly such kind of uv completions , in the sense that they reproduce many interesting features of the orbifold guts in certain low energy limits .",
    "( connections between orbifold guts and an @xmath13 string model have already been established in ref .",
    "the present paper contains more detailed discussions on these connections .",
    "see also the recent paper  @xcite . )    to make the connections between string and field theoretical models more concrete , we consider some examples , in particular , the 5d @xmath13 model of ref .",
    "@xcite and a generalization with bulk gauge group e@xmath6 . in these models ,",
    "the extra dimension is taken to be an orbicircle @xmath2 and the 4d effective theory has a pati - salam ( ps ) symmetry , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the technical apparatus we adopt to build string models is the simplest abelian symmetric orbifold compactification @xcite of the heterotic string @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we consider a non - prime - order @xmath0 orbifold ( or equivalently , @xmath15 ) model with the orbifold twist vector @xmath16 .",
    "to achieve three chiral ps families at low energies , we also introduce several ( in fact , two ) discrete wilson lines @xcite .",
    "orbifold models ) with wilson lines @xcite and non - prime - order orbifold models without wilson lines @xcite have been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "non - prime - order orbifold models with wilson lines , on the other hand , possess a number of complications , and to our knowledge they have not been studied to the same extent .",
    "our work can be regarded as the first serious attempt at constructing three - family models from non - prime - order orbifolds . ]",
    "it is obvious that the third compactified complex dimension has a @xmath1 symmetry in the @xmath0 model , hence it can consistently be taken to be the root lattice of the @xmath17 lie algebra .",
    "the string models are effectively 5d when the length of one of the @xmath17 simple roots is large compared to the string scale , while all other dimensions are kept comparable to the string scale ( i.e. the geometry of the compactified space is equivalent to that of the orbifold guts , @xmath2 ) . in this limit ,",
    "the @xmath0 heterotic models are similar to the orbifold gut models in the following respects :    * the 5d @xmath18 supersymmetry supersymmetry in 5 or 6d , we mean the minimal number of supersymmetries in these dimensions , ( i.e. the fermions satisfy the pseudo - reality condition ) .",
    "it reduces to @xmath18 in 4d by dimensional reduction and is sometimes called @xmath19 supersymmetry in the literature . ] is broken to that of @xmath19 in 4d by the @xmath1 orbifold twist and the  bulk \" gauge group is broken to two different regular subgroups at the two inequivalent fixed points by degree-2 non - trivial gauge embedding and wilson line .",
    "the surviving gauge group in the 4d effective theory is the intersection of groups at the fixed points .",
    "it is the ps group in our models .",
    "more specifically , we find two types of models . in the first type we have an @xmath7 symmetry in the 5d bulk which is broken to @xmath13 and @xmath20 respectively . in the second type",
    "we have an @xmath21 in the bulk , broken to ps at one of the two fixed points . *",
    "untwisted - sector and twisted - sector states that are not localized on the @xmath1 fixed points of the @xmath17 lattice can be identified with the  bulk \" states of the orbifold gut .",
    "interpretation of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) towers of the bulk gauge and matter fields agree in the string - based and orbifold gut models .",
    "* twisted - sector states that are localized on the @xmath1 fixed points of the @xmath17 lattice have no field theoretical counterparts , although they can correctly be identified with the `` brane '' states of the orbifold gut . in the orbifold gut models ,",
    "these states are only constrained by the requirement of ( chiral ) anomaly cancellation .    of course , string theoretical models are more intricate than the corresponding field theoretic orbifold gut models .",
    "they need to satisfy more stringent consistency conditions and thus they are physically more constrained .",
    "we find it is highly non - trivial ( or impossible ) to implement all the features of the orbifold guts .",
    "for example , we can not arbitrarily place the three families of quarks and leptons in the bulk or on either brane .",
    "moreover , the very act of obtaining three families , along with their respective locations , is fixed by the requirement that the gauge embeddings and wilson lines have to satisfy the modular invariance conditions @xcite .",
    "in addition , we can not utilize the orbifold projections to remove all the @xmath22 color - triplet states as in the @xmath13 orbifold guts @xcite and at the same time obtain three families .",
    "we also find many massless states carrying unconventional representations under the sm gauge group .",
    "these exotic states are commonplace in almost all known three - family models .",
    "whether these models can give rise to satisfactory phenomenology needs more detailed knowledge of the low - energy effective actions .",
    "the present status of our analysis is contained in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : ft ] we briefly review 5d field theories on the orbicircle @xmath2 and present two orbifold gut models with bulk gauge groups @xmath13 and @xmath7 . the latter ( model a1 ) is a novel 5d model with many nice phenomenological features .",

    "note that this result relies on the assumptions that the compactified space is symmetric , i.e. , all the dimensions are of similar sizes , and there are no additional states near the gut scale .",
    "both assumptions are invalid in our models .    in heterotic models",
    ", it is well known that gauge couplings can obtain potentially large threshold corrections only if the models contain @xmath18 sub - sectors @xcite .",
    "our @xmath370 orbifold models have exactly this kind of property , since both the @xmath1 and @xmath132 sub - orbifold twists leave exactly one complex plane unrotated .",
    "it is , however , a very complicate matter to compute gauge threshold corrections in string theory in the presence of discrete wilson lines .",
    "( the simplest way to compute these corrections is using the target space duality symmetry @xcite , however in the presence of discrete wilson lines the duality groups are broken to their discrete subgroups @xcite . even for the much simpler @xmath325 models , threshold corrections are only known numerically @xcite . )",
    "fortunately we can use a much simpler field theoretical method to compute gauge threshold corrections in the orbifold gut limit , i.e. , when one of the @xmath17 dimensions is much larger than the string length scale and other compactified dimensions . in this limit , all the winding modes and kk modes in small dimensions have string scale mass , and according to refs .",
    "@xcite one would expect the dominant contributions to the threshold corrections come from the kk modes of the large dimension . from now on , we shall assume this is correct and neglect all the contributions from states with string scale mass .",
    "the gauge coupling at the string scale , @xmath371 , imposes a boundary condition for the renormalization group equations at the cut - off scale , which is taken to be the string scale , @xmath372 .",

    "@xmath378 is the jacobi theta function , @xmath379 , representing the summation over kk states .    in our models , there are several modifications in the calculation .",
    "firstly there are four sets of kk towers , with mass @xmath380 ( for @xmath75 ) , @xmath381 ( for @xmath382 ) and @xmath383 ( for @xmath73 , @xmath384 and @xmath385 , @xmath74 ) , where @xmath386 .",
    "the summations over kk states give respectively @xmath387 for the first two cases and @xmath388 for the last two ( where @xmath389 ) , and we have separated out the zero modes in the @xmath75 case .",
    "secondly , the ps symmetry in our models must be further broken down to that of the sm .",
    "this breaking , in principle , can be induced by brane or bulk states . however , in sect .",

    "we further assume the breaking scale , @xmath390 , is smaller than or equal to the compactification scale , @xmath391 , so that we can neglect mass corrections to the massive kk states .",
    "tracing the renormalization group evolution from low energy scales , we are first in the realm of the mssm , and the beta function coefficients are @xmath392 . when we pass the ps breaking scale , @xmath390 , the beta function coefficients become @xmath393 , where the two terms represent contributions from the bulk and brane states",
    ". these coefficients can contain contributions from additional states besides those of the mssm , for example , from a vector - like pair @xmath394 .",
    "the next energy threshold is the compactification scale @xmath391 . from this scale to the string scale",
    ", we have the four sets of kk states . since we have assumed @xmath395 , the beta function coefficients are those of the complete ps representations .    collecting these facts , and using @xmath396 for @xmath397 , we find the gqw equations , & & + b^mssm_i + ( b^ps_+++b_brane)_i + & - & ( b^ps_+++b^ps_)_i+b^g ( -1),[rg ] for @xmath398 , where we have taken the cut - off scales , @xmath399 and @xmath400 .",
    "@xmath401 , so in fact it is the beta function coefficient of the orbifold gut gauge group , @xmath402 .",
    "the beta function coefficients in the last two terms have an @xmath18 nature , since the massive kk states enjoy a large supersymmetry . for @xmath403 and @xmath7 , @xmath404 and @xmath405 , where @xmath406 , @xmath407 and @xmath408 are numbers of bulk hypermultiplets in the respective representations . to accomplish bulk breaking , we need @xmath409 in models a1/b and @xmath410 , @xmath411 in model a2 , therefore @xmath412 and @xmath413 .",

    "<S> motivated by orbifold grand unified theories , we construct a class of three - family pati - salam models in a @xmath0 abelian symmetric orbifold with two discrete wilson lines . </S>",
    "<S> these models have marked differences from previously - constructed three - family models in prime - order orbifolds . in the limit where one of the six compactified dimensions ( which lies in a @xmath1 sub - orbifold ) is large compared to the string length scale , </S>",
    "<S> our models reproduce the supersymmetry and gauge symmetry breaking pattern of 5d orbifold grand unified theories on an @xmath2 orbicircle . </S>",
    "<S> we find a horizontal @xmath3 splitting in the chiral matter spectra  2 families of matter are localized on the @xmath1 orbifold fixed points , and 1 family propagates in the 5d bulk  and identify them as the first - two and third families . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the first two families enjoy a non - abelian dihedral @xmath4 family symmetry , due to the geometric setup of the compactified space . in all our models </S>",
    "<S> there are always some color triplets , i.e. @xmath5 representations of the pati - salam group , survive orbifold projections . </S>",
    "<S> they could be utilized to spontaneously break the pati - salam symmetry to that of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> one model , with a 5d e@xmath6 symmetry , may give rise to interesting low energy phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> we study gauge coupling unification , allowed yukawa couplings and some of their phenomenological consequences . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 model has a renormalizable yukawa coupling only for the third family . </S>",
    "<S> it predicts a gauge - yukawa unification relation at the 5d compactification scale , and is capable of generating reasonable quark / lepton masses and mixings . </S>",
    "<S> potential problems are also addressed , they may point to the direction for refining our models . </S>"
