    "the standard theory of structure formation based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm explains that the large scale structures of the universe like galaxies , groups and clusters of galaxies are originated from the primordial fluctuations of the matter density field through gravitational instability . in this scenario ,",
    "the observed properties of the large scale structures can be used to extract crucial information on the initial conditions of the early universe .    among the various properties of the large scale structures ,",
    "it is the abundance of galaxy clusters that has attracted most cosmological attentions so far .",
    "since the clusters are relatively young still in the quasi - linear regime , their abundance can be inferred from the linear theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , being rare , the evolution of galaxy clusters depends sensitively on the background cosmology , especially on the amplitude of the matter power spectrum on scale of @xmath8 mpc ( @xmath5 ) and the density parameter ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "it has been shown that by comparing the linear theory prediction with the cluster abundance from x - ray or sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect observations one can constrain @xmath5 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite found a relation of @xmath9 ( for a flat universe with non - zero cosmological constant , @xmath10 ) by comparing the press - schechter prediction with the local abundance of the x - ray clusters complied by @xcite .    to break the degeneracy between @xmath5 and @xmath4 , however , it is necessary to find another relation obtained from another observable property of galaxy clusters .",
    "one candidate is the shape of galaxy clusters .",
    "it has long been known observationally as well as numerically that in general the shapes of galaxy clusters are not so much spherical as elliptical @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown by recent numerical simulations that the ellipticity distribution of galaxy clusters depend strongly on the background cosmology @xcite .",
    "this numerical finding implies that it may be possible to find a new independent relation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 with the ellipticity distribution of galaxy clusters .",
    "most of the previous approaches to the cluster ellipticity distribution were numerical . in order to use the cluster ellipticity distribution as a cosmological probe , however , it is highly desirable to have an analytic model derived from physical principles .",
    "although @xcite made a first analytic attempt in the frame of the density peak formalism , their model was applicable only in the asymptotic limit of low ellipticity .",
    "very recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , ljs05 ) derived a new analytic expression for the halo axis - ratio distribution by combining the density peak formalism and the zeldovich approximation .",
    "they demonstrated that the analytic model produces the characteristic behaviors of the halo axis - ratio distribution found in simulations , which gives a hope that it may provide a theoretical footing for the use of the cluster ellipticity distribution as a cosmological probe .",
    "our goal here is to find a new functional form of the @xmath7 relation , independent of the previous one derived from the cluster abundance , by comparing the ljs05 analytic prediction to the axis - ratio distribution of galaxy clusters determined from the recent observational catalog .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in @xmath11 , we provide a brief description of the observational data . in @xmath12 , we explain how to derive an analytic axis - ratio distribution of two dimensional projected profiles of galaxy clusters from the ljs05 formalism . in @xmath13 , we find a new functional form of relation @xmath7 relation through fitting the model to the observational data . in @xmath14 , we discuss the success and the limitation of our work , and draw a final conclusion .",
    "the c4 catalog contains @xmath15 objects @xcite identified in the second data release ( dr2 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the sky coverage and the redshift range of the catalog are @xmath16 deg@xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the majority of the objects in this catalog are clusters of galaxies with the mean membership of @xmath19 galaxies . in the catalog ,",
    "however , are also included smaller groups with the membership of at most @xmath20 galaxies as well as larger structures with the membership of over @xmath21 _ clusters_. the mass range of the catalog is thus quite broad from @xmath22to @xmath23 ( @xmath24 : the dimensionless hubble parameter ) .",
    "the sdss - c4 catalog provides various spectroscopic properties of galaxy clusters , among which the following informations are used for our study : the axis - ratio of a projected two - dimensional image ( @xmath25 ) , the virial mass ( @xmath26 ) , and the redshift ( @xmath27 ) . as below",
    ", we briefly describe how these quantities were measured . for",
    "the detailed descriptions of the c4 catalog and the measurement of @xmath26 and @xmath25 , refer to the web - page : + http://www.ctio.noao.edu/@xmath28chrism/current/research/c4/dr2/ sdss_parameters.html .",
    "the axis ratio , @xmath25 , is derived from an elliptical fit to a projected two dimensional image of a cluster .",
    "the elliptical fit was conducted by the diagonalization of the covariance of the positions of all galaxies within @xmath1 kpc with respect to the cluster center .",
    "the center of a cluster is also measured using all galaxies within @xmath1 kpc .",
    "the virial mass , @xmath26 , of each cluster was computed ( assuming the isothermality and the spherical shape ) as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion and @xmath31 is the deprojected three dimensional virial radius of a cluster @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath31 is related to the _ ringwise projected harmonic mean radius _ , @xmath32 ( see eq . 3 in ,",
    "* ) , as @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath32 depends on which scale radius is used in selecting the member galaxies . in the catalog ,",
    "there are five different criteria used to measure the value of @xmath26 : @xmath34 , @xmath1 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 kpc .    in this paper ,",
    "consistently , we use the criterion @xmath38 kpc . using the fixed scale radius @xmath38 kpc",
    "does not mean that the virial radius of a cluster is fixed to be @xmath1 kpc for all clusters .",
    "what it means is that the ringwise projected harmonic mean radius , @xmath32 , was determined using those galaxies within the scale radius @xmath38 kpc from the cluster center .",
    "but , note that using the fixed scale radius of @xmath38 kpc may systematically affect the determination of the cluster mass , @xmath26 .",
    "since the catalog contains various objects in the wide mass range , using the fixed scale radius of @xmath38 can cause either underestimate or overestimate of the value of @xmath26 , depending on how massive an object is . to reduce this kind of possible systematic effect , we focus only on the narrow cluster mass range of @xmath39 .",
    "we find total @xmath40 such clusters in the catalog with the median redshift of @xmath41 .",
    "the ljs05 analytic model for the axis - ratio distribution of dark halos adopts two classical theories as its background : the zeldovich approximation @xcite and the density peak formalism @xcite .    by applying the zeldovich approximation",
    ", ljs05 assumed that the three principal axes of a triaxial halo , @xmath42 ( with @xmath43 ) are related to the three eigenvalues @xmath44 ( with @xmath45 ) of the linear deformation tensor , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the perturbation potential : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the growth rate of the linear density field . here",
    ", the sum of the three eigenvalues equals the linear density contrast , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 : the mean density ) : @xmath52 .    by employing the density peak formalism",
    ", ljs05 also assumed that a region in the linear density field will condense out a virialized halo if it satisfies the following two conditions : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 represent the threshold values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the value of @xmath60 can be theoretically evaluated with the help of the top - hat spherical collapse model .",
    "for instance , @xmath61 for a flat universe with closure density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as for the value of @xmath62 , it is precisely @xmath63 in the original density peak formalism .",
    "instead of using this theoretical value , however , ljs05 used a positive value of @xmath64 which was determined empirically through fitting .",
    "their claim was that the break - down of the linear theory in the highly nonlinear regime is responsible for the deviation of @xmath62 from the theoretical value of @xmath63 in practice .    here",
    ", we use the theoretical value of @xmath65 rather than the empirical value of @xmath66 for the following reason .",
    "the value of @xmath67 was found empirically by comparing the analytic model with the numerical result for the concordance cosmology only .",
    "remember that our purpose is to use the analytic distribution as a probe of cosmology without having any bias .",
    "hence , we set @xmath62 at the original theoretical value @xmath63 in the rest of this paper .",
    "defining two real variables @xmath68 and @xmath69 as @xmath70 ljs05 derived analytically the joint probability density distribution of @xmath68 and @xmath69 which depends on the cluster mass @xmath26 and the formation epoch @xmath71 : @xmath72 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times(2\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2}-\\delta_{c})(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2 } ) ( \\lambda_{1}+2\\lambda_{2}-\\delta_{c } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\theta\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{d_{f}-\\lambda_{1}}\\right ) \\theta[\\delta_{c}-(\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2 } ) ] \\left|\\frac{(\\partial\\lambda_{1}\\partial\\lambda_{2 } ) } { ( \\partial\\mu_{1}\\partial\\mu_{2})}\\right| , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the standard variation of the linear density field , and @xmath75 is the normalization factor which satisfies @xmath76    the relation between @xmath77 and @xmath78 are given as @xmath79 and the jacobian @xmath80 was found to be @xmath81    equation ( [ eqn : ratio_dis ] ) gives the probability distribution of the two axis - ratios of a triaxial galaxy cluster with mass @xmath26 formed at @xmath71 . in practice , however , what we measure is not the formation epoch , @xmath82 but the observation epoch , @xmath27 , i.e. , the redshift at which a cluster is observed .",
    "hence , ljs05 rederived an analytic expression for @xmath83 from equation ( [ eqn : ratio_dis ] ) as @xmath84 where @xmath85 represents the formation epoch distribution of galaxy clusters . ljs05",
    "used the fitting formula given by @xcite which is an approximation to the analytic expression found by @xcite .",
    "although equations ( [ eqn : ratio_dis])-([eqn : ratiodis_z ] ) provides an analytic expression for the axis - ratio distribution of the _ three dimensional _ shape of a triaxial cluster with mass @xmath26 observed at @xmath27 , it is hard to compare it directly with the observational data . in observation , as we noted in @xmath11 , what is measured is only a _ two dimensional _ projected profile of a galaxy cluster .",
    "therefore , for a proper comparison with observational data , it is necessary to incorporate the effect of projection along the line of sight into the analytic model .    to incorporate into equation ( [ eqn : ratiodis_z ] ) the projection effect onto the plane of the sky , we follow @xcite :",
    "let @xmath86 be the usual polar coordinates of the line - of - sight vector in the principal axes of a triaxial cluster , and let @xmath25 be the axis - ratio of a two dimensional cluster profile projected along the line of sight direction .",
    "then , the probability density distribution of @xmath25 can be obtained by performing an integration of equation ( [ eqn : ratio_dis ] ) over @xmath87 as @xmath88~p(\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2};m , z),\\ ] ] where @xmath89^{1/2 } } { u+v + \\left[(u - v)^{2}+w^{2}\\right]^{1/2}}\\right\\}^{1/2},\\ ] ] and @xmath90 through equations ( [ eqn : ratio_dis])-([eqn : c_def ] ) , one can evaluate analytically the probability density that the projected profile of a galaxy cluster of mass @xmath26 is observed to have an axis - ratio of @xmath25 at redshift @xmath27 .",

    "the cosmological parameters used to characterize each model are listed in table 1 .",
    "as one can see , equation ( [ eqn:2d_ratiodis ] ) depends sensitively on the background cosmology .",
    "more elliptical clusters are predicted by the @xmath102 and ocdm models with high @xmath5 and low @xmath4 than by the scdm and @xmath101cdm models with low @xmath5 and high @xmath4 .",
    "it can be understood by the following logic : the scdm and @xmath101cdm models predict more small scale powers , and thus should result in rounder shapes of galaxy clusters in the end .",
    "we compare equation ( [ eqn:2d_ratiodis ] ) with the observational distribution from the 336 sdss - c4 clusters , assuming the @xmath10cdm .",
    "figure [ fig : distribution ] plots together the analytic ( solid line ) and the observational ( dots ) axis - ratio results for comparison .",
    "the errors of the observational points are poissonian .",

    "as one can see , the overall agreement between the two is quite good .",
    "the analytic axis - ratio distribution ( eq.[[eqn:2d_ratiodis ] ] ) depends on the cluster mass @xmath26 and redshift @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , to compare it with the observational data , one has to first specify the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . as for @xmath27 , to be consistent with the observational data , we set it at the median redshift of the selected 336 clusters , @xmath41 , given that the redshift range of the selected clusters is quite narrow .    as for @xmath26",
    ", there is a subtle point that has to be taken into consideration .",
    "the virial mass , @xmath26 , of each cluster in the c4 catalog was computed under the assumption of a _ concordance _ cosmology with @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 . in other words ,",
    "the cluster mass @xmath26 given in the catalog is biased toward the concordance cosmology , which has to be avoided in the parameter estimation .",
    "thus , we set @xmath26 at the _ characteristic mass scale _ , @xmath99 , defined as @xmath107 where @xmath108mpc is the top - hat spherical radius on which scale the rms density fluctuation is _ observed _ to be very close to unity , and @xmath109mpc@xmath110 .",
    "since the galaxy clusters are the largest collapsed objects in the universe , the characteristic mass scale @xmath99 is believed to represent the typical mass of galaxy clusters .",
    "note that this characteristic cluster mass , @xmath99 , by its definition ( eq.[[eqn : m8 ] ] ) , depends on the value of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , putting @xmath111 into equation ( [ eqn:2d_ratiodis ] ) , will optimize the parameter estimation without bearing any bias toward a certain cosmology .",
    "the analytic distribution ( [ eqn:2d_ratiodis ] ) depends not only on @xmath4 and @xmath5 but also on @xmath112 , @xmath24 , and @xmath94 as well .",
    "here , we focus mainly on constraining @xmath4 and @xmath5 , assuming that the other parameters are already known as priors .",
    "we use the following priors from the cmb observation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the hst key project @xcite and the big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite : @xmath113 ( a flat universe ) ; @xmath106 ; @xmath114 .",
    "once the values of @xmath24 and @xmath95 are given , the shape factor , @xmath94 , will depend only on the value of @xmath4 ( see eq.[[eqn : gamma ] ] ) .",
    "now that all parameters except for @xmath4 and @xmath5 in equation ( [ eqn:2d_ratiodis ] ) are prescribed , we can fit the observational data points obtained in @xmath11 to equation ( [ eqn:2d_ratiodis ] ) with adjusting @xmath4 and @xmath5 in ranges of @xmath115 $ ] and @xmath116 $ ] , respectively .",

    "the single best - fit values , however , are unreliable given the uncertainty in @xmath117 due to the strong correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "measurements @xcite .",
    "we have found a new @xmath7 relation by comparing the ljs05 analytic model for the axis - ratio distribution of galaxy clusters with the observational data from the sdss - c4 catalog .",
    "the success of our final result , however , is subject to a couple of caveats .",
    "the first caveat comes from our assumption that the principal axes of the sdss - c4 clusters derived from the elliptical fits to the galaxy distributions are directly comparable to that of the analytically derived shapes of dark halos .",
    "this is an obvious simplification of the reality .",
    "notwithstanding , the following observational and numerical clues should provide a justification for this simplified assumption .",
    "many observations revealed that the spatial distribution of cluster galaxies and the major axes of their host clusters are arranged in a collinear way @xcite .",
    "recent numerical simulations also demonstrated that the dark halo substructures are preferentially located along the major axes of their host halos @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite showed by n - body simulations that the triaxial shapes of dark matter halos can be reconstructed from the the anisotropic spatial distribution of their substructures .",
    "given these empirical findings , one may expect that the cluster principal axis derived from the elliptical fit to the galaxy distribution is comparable to the analytical one derived from the the smooth dark matter distribution .",
    "the second caveat lies in the limited validity of the analytic model .",
    "as shown by ljs05 , the prediction of our analytic model on the cluster ellipticity - mass relation disagrees with the numerical finding .",
    "our model predicts that the cluster ellipticity decreases with mass , while many different numerical simulations @xcite found that the cluster ellipticity actually increases with mass .    in spite of this limitation of the ljs05 analytic model ,",
    "it is still true that the ljs05 tested their model against n - body simulations and showed that it works quite well , reproducing the characteristic behaviors of the numerical result , on a single mass scale ( or in a narrow mass range ) . in other words , although the ljs05 model fails in predicting the `` change '' of the axis - ratio distribution in the wide range of halo mass , it can still be used to predict the shape of the axis - ratio distribution of a dark halo with a given mass .",
    "as we consider here only those objects in the c4 catalog whose mass lies in a narrow range @xmath127 for the comparison with the analytic model , the ljs05 model is expected to be a useful approximation .    definitely ,",
    "however , it will be desirable and necessary to refine our model more realistically before applying it to a wide range of mass of cosmic structures .",
    "finally , we conclude that it is possible in principle to constrain both @xmath4 and @xmath5 concurrently from the observation of galaxy clusters alone , as the cluster shape and abundance distributions provide two different @xmath7 relations .",
    "the amplitude of the linear power spectrum obtained from the shape and abundance distribution of the galaxy clusters is consistent with the high value estimated from the recent _ wmap _ measurements .",
