    "spectral stability of the bifurcating waves has been treated in @xcite , where it was shown that they are spectrally stable if the bifurcation is supercritical and spectrally unstable if the bifurcation is subcritical .",

    "we first recall the techniques that can be used to study the nonlinear stability of stationary lax shocks @xmath139 of ( [ main ] ) . taking a solution of the form @xmath140 , the resulting equation for the perturbation @xmath141 is @xmath142 where @xmath143_x , \\qquad q(v , v_x ) = -f(\\bar{u}+v)+f(\\bar{u})+f_u(\\bar{u})v.\\ ] ] one way to understand the linearized equation @xmath144 is to take its laplace transform and obtain @xmath145",
    "this equation can be solved using the resolvent operator , and taking the inverse laplace transform of the result leads to the standard representation @xmath146^{-1}\\,{\\mathrm{d}}\\lambda\\ ] ] of the linear semigroup , where @xmath147 is a curve in the complex plane that lies entirely in the resolvent set of @xmath148 . for viscous shocks",
    ", the essential spectrum of @xmath148 contains the origin .",
    "hence , we can not easily derive good decay estimates for the linear semigroup , because we can not move the contour @xmath147 into the origin , where analyticity of the resolvent @xmath149^{-1}$ ] breaks down .",
    "instead , we exploit that @xmath148 is a differential operator and construct its green s distribution . the green s distribution @xmath150 is given by the semigroup acting on the dirac delta function centered at @xmath105 : @xmath151^{-1 } \\delta(\\cdot - y ) \\right)(x)\\,{\\mathrm{d}}\\lambda = : \\frac{1}{2\\pi{\\mathrm{i}}}\\int_\\gamma { \\mathrm{e}}^{t\\lambda } g(x , y,\\lambda)\\,{\\mathrm{d}}\\lambda.\\ ] ] using variation of constants , solutions to the nonlinear equation",
    "can then be written as @xmath152 to derive decay estimates for the green s distribution , and hence for the integrals in ( [ e : vc ] ) , we can now deform the contour @xmath147 in the rightmost integral in ( [ e : gd ] ) pointwise for each @xmath153 .",
    "the key is that the resolvent kernel @xmath154 satisfies the ordinary differential equation @xmath155_x,\\ ] ] so that ode techniques such as the gap lemma @xcite can be used to extend the resolvent kernel meromorphically across @xmath156 for each fixed @xmath153 .",
    "it is then possible , see @xcite , to move the contour @xmath147 for each @xmath153 to extract the leading order behavior of the green s distribution @xmath150 .",
    "we now illustrate the outcome of extending the resolvent kernel meromorphically across the origin @xmath156 .",
    "first , @xmath156 is a simple embedded eigenvalue with the exponentially localized eigenfunction @xmath50 .",
    "the associated adjoint eigenfunction is a constant @xmath67 .",
    "eigenvalues correspond to poles of the resolvent , and we therefore expect to obtain the term @xmath157 , which involves the spectral projection , when we extend the resolvent kernel across the origin",
    ". a second contribution should appear due to the essential spectrum : to determine its contribution , we consider the constant - coefficient equation @xmath158 for @xmath114 , say , where we neglected the shock profile , which we already accounted for through the spectral projection . to construct bounded solutions of this equation , we need to find the roots of the characteristic equation @xmath159 , which are given by @xmath160 and @xmath161 for @xmath162 near zero .",
    "the latter roots are the dangerous ones as they give small exponential rates for the associated solutions of ( [ e : rk ] ) , and thus they will determine the next term , after the spectral projection , in the expansion of the resolvent kernel .",
    "in addition , we need to select those roots that give exponential decay of the resolvent kernel in @xmath153 when @xmath163 . using this information and the notation @xmath164 ,",
    "the expansion @xmath165 for the resolvent kernel can be derived when @xmath114 for appropriate coefficients @xmath166 that depend on the summation indices .",
    "the different cases in the equation above account for the transport of the perturbation along different characteristics , which we will discuss in more detail below .",
    "the inverse laplace transform of the resolvent kernel is given by @xmath167 thus , the spectral projection onto the eigenfunction @xmath50 appears , while the essential spectrum leads to gaussians that move along the characteristics as they decay .",
    "it turns out that it is advantageous to use the term @xmath168 in place of @xmath169 , which uses an expansion of the adjoint eigenfunction in terms of the weak spatial eigenvalues @xmath170 .",
    "this leads to the decomposition @xmath171 of the green s distribution with @xmath172 for @xmath114 , where we again use the notation @xmath173 and @xmath174 to denote outgoing and incoming characteristics to aid in the following intuitive explanation of the above representation .     of the adjoint eigenfunction",
    "on the right , the correspondence between the three terms in @xmath130 and transport along the characteristics is illustrated . ]",
    "the term @xmath175 consists of the eigenfunction @xmath50 and the inverse laplace transform @xmath176 of the expansion of its adjoint eigenfunction .",
    "hence , @xmath175 is an expansion of the spectral projection .",
    "the sum in @xmath176 is taken over the incoming directions , and it therefore tracks the initial data and nonlinear interactions resulting from the perturbation as they move in towards the shock and records their effect on the shock location . a sketch of the function @xmath177 is given in figure  [ f : greens_diagram ] : notice that @xmath178 pointwise as @xmath73 , and so @xmath179 .",
    "the three pieces of @xmath130 record , respectively , how the perturbation moves along the different characteristics that transport it in three distinct ways , as illustrated in figure  [ f : greens_diagram ] : outwards away from the shock ( 1 ) ; inwards towards the shock and then reflected back out again ( 2 ) ; and in towards the shock , through it , and outwards on the other side of the shock ( 3 ) .",
    "we can now outline the nonlinear stability argument , which uses the above decomposition in the integral equation ( [ e : vc ] ) .",
    "more precisely , to track the shock location and remove the neutral direction @xmath50 along the shock translates from ( [ e : vc ] ) , we write solutions as @xmath180 exploiting the decomposition of the green s distribution , we define the phase shift @xmath181 implicitly using @xmath182(y , s ) \\,{\\mathrm{d}}y\\,{\\mathrm{d}}s\\ ] ] and find after some algebra that the perturbation @xmath141 satisfies the integral equation @xmath183(y , s ) \\,{\\mathrm{d}}y \\,{\\mathrm{d}}s.\\ ] ] note that the evolution of @xmath141 is now governed only by the decaying part @xmath130 of the green s distribution . in @xcite , it was shown that pointwise bounds , which result from the above formulas for @xmath175 and @xmath130 , can now be used to establish existence of solutions to these integral equations and to prove that @xmath181 converges to a limit @xmath184 , while @xmath141 decays algebraically to zero .",
    "given the success of pointwise estimates in establishing stability of stationary viscous shocks , we would like to use the same technique in the case of time - periodic shocks .",

    "we showed that spectral stability of a time - periodic shock profile implies its nonlinear stability with respect to small initial perturbations that are smooth and sufficiently localized in space .",
    "specifically , we proved that the corresponding solution converges with algebraic rate @xmath1068 in @xmath133 to an appropriate space- and time - translate of the shock profile @xmath53 .",

    "finally , a nonlinear iteration scheme that utilizes the anticipated spatio - temporal decay of perturbations closes the argument .",
    "the key difference from the case of stationary shocks is the time - periodicity of the underlying operators . to resolve this issue",
    ", we use spatial dynamics and exponential dichotomies to construct the analogue of the resolvent kernel and its meromorphic extension .",
    "one novel feature of our analysis is that we do not use evans functions : instead , the geometric properties that ultimately determine the order of the pole of the meromorphic extension at the origin are encoded through lyapunov ",
    "schmidt reduction .",
    "another advantage of our approach to meromorphic extensions through exponential dichotomies is that it is abstract and coordinate - free .",
    "this has several useful implications , which we shall now discuss .",
    "first , as already discussed in  [ introduction ] , our results are also true for undercompressive , overcompressive , and mixed - type shock profiles , provided the notion of spectral stability is appropriately adapted and interpreted .",
    "indeed , lemma  [ l : fredholm ] essentially reduces the meromorphic extension to finite - dimensional problems that are analogous to the stationary case , and therefore well understood .",
    "similarly , the nonlinear iteration scheme relies primarily on the template functions that describe the anticipated temporal decay and are identical to those of the stationary case .",
    "the fact that the evans function is not used in our analysis opens up the possibility of extending our nonlinear - stability analysis to semi - discretizations of viscous shocks .",
    "two - sided spatial finite difference approximations of viscous conservation laws lead to lattice differential equations .",
    "their travelling waves satisfy functional differential equations of mixed type that are ill - posed as initial - value problems .",
    "more importantly , their stable and unstable eigenspaces are infinite - dimensional , and it is therefore unclear how evans functions could be defined ( we refer to @xcite for situations where this can be done through galerkin approximations ) .",
    "it was , however , shown in @xcite that these equations admit exponential dichotomies .",
    "thus , it is feasible that our approach could be used to establish nonlinear stability of semi - discretized shock profiles , thereby extending the analysis carried out in @xcite for one - sided finite differences .",
    "we end this paper with three open problems .",
    "first , though we attempted to prepare the ground for a future analysis that addresses quasilinear , partially parabolic systems , we did not actually consider real viscosity here .",
    "we expect , however , that our main strategy should be applicable to such systems as in the related analyses of @xcite .",
    "another open problem is to find concrete examples of time - periodic lax shocks .",
    "while previous analyses have shown that time - periodic lax shocks bifurcate at hopf bifurcations from stationary shocks , no examples are yet known where these bifurcations occur .",
    "the last issue is of a technical nature .",
    "our construction of the resolvent kernel relied on an iterative birman ",
    "schwinger or parametrix - type argument , which is quite involved and does not immediately give expansions or bounds of the resolvent kernel . as discussed in ",
    "[ s : greens_functions ] , it should be possible to use exponential dichotomies directly to construct the resolvent kernel , but we have so far not been able to make this argument rigorous .",
