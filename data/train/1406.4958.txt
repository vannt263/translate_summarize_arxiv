    "graphons have been introduced as limit objects of convergent sequences of dense simple graphs , and many aspects of graphs can be extended to graphons .",
    "the goal of this paper is to describe a natural way to extend the notion of graph automorphisms to graphons .",
    "our notion of automorphism group satisfies the natural requirement that it is invariant under weak isomorphism of graphons .",
    "( weakly isomorphic graphons represent the limit objects of the same convergent graph sequences . )",
    "thus our study of the automorphisms of graphons fits well into graph limit theory .    in this paper",
    "we heavily use the topological aspects of graph limit theory developed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that every graphon has two `` canonical '' representations on metric spaces , which we call , informally , the _ neighborhood metric _ and the _ @xmath1-neighborhood metric_. these metric spaces depend only on the weak isomorphism class of the graphon .",
    "( in @xcite , these are called the `` neighborhood metric '' and the `` similarity metric '' . )",
    "the neighborhood metric space is simpler to define and work with , but it is not compact in general ; the @xmath1-neighborhood metric space is compact .",
    "the automorphism group acts on each of these as a subgroup of isometries .",
    "it is a rather straightforward consequence of the compactness of the @xmath1-neighborhood metric that the automorphism group is always a compact topological group ( theorem [ thm : aut - comp ] ) .",
    "this fact is also closely related to ( and could be derived from ) a theorem of vershik and habck @xcite on the compactness of isometry groups of multivariate functions . as a consequence",
    "we prove that for node - transitive graphons the neighborhood metric is also compact .",
    "the space of graphons ( with weakly isomorphic graphons identified ) is compact in a natural topology ( defined by the `` cut distance '' ) .",
    "another result of this paper is that the set of node - transitive graphons is closed , and hence compact , in this topology .",
    "as we will see , graph limit theory restricted to this closed set gives rise to a rather interesting limit theory for functions on groups .",
    "such a theory was initiated in @xcite , and it was a crucial component of the limit approach to higher order fourier analysis ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we give a characterization of the orbits of the automorphism group on @xmath0-tuples of points .",
    "this generalizes results in @xcite from finite graphs to graphons , as well as the characterization of weak isomorphism of graphons by borgs , chayes and lovsz @xcite .",
    "we use this characterization to connect the topic of graph algebras with group theory . as an application",
    ", we give a group theoretic description of the graph algebras defined by finite rank graphons .",
    "it follows from our results that the limit of a convergent sequence of finite graphs , each having a node - transitive automorphism group , is a node - transitive graphon .",
    "however , the relationship between the automorphism groups of the finite graphs and that of the limit graphon is more involved .",
