    "thus one naturally arrives at a two - component spinor wave function of the quasiparticle excitations in graphene ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for some analogies with a real spin ) .",
    "these components reflect the amplitude of the electron wave function on the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sublattices .",
    "the two - component form of the wave function along with the band structure results in the dirac form of the effective theory for graphene .",

    "the lll splits into two levels with the energy @xmath4 , where @xmath5 distinguishes inequivalent @xmath6 and @xmath7 points of the brillouin zone and an external magnetic field @xmath8 is applied perpendicularly to the plane of graphene along the positive @xmath9 axis @xcite . here",

    "the corresponding amplitudes of the wave function of the positive energy electron - like , @xmath12 , and negative energy hole - like , @xmath13 , levels are on @xmath1 and @xmath2 sublattices .",
    "in other words , the individual sublattices are valley polarized for the lll @xcite .",
    "an exciting opportunity for manipulating the amplitudes of the wave function on the sublattices opens due to close connection between the impact of deformation and external electromagnetic field on the electron structure of graphene .",
    "change in hopping energy between @xmath1 and @xmath2 atoms induced by strain can be described by vector potential @xmath14 analogous to the vector potential @xmath11 of the external magnetic field ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .    the corresponding field , @xmath15 , is called pseudomagnetic field ( pmf ) , because it is directed oppositely in @xmath6 and @xmath7 valleys .",
    "this implies that the lll breaks the electron - hole symmetry , with the lll energy , @xmath16 for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 points .",
    "furthermore , the states corresponding to the lll are sublattice polarized , because they reside exclusively on either @xmath1 or @xmath2 sublattice @xcite .    while the formation of the lll is associated with zero modes and does not require a homogeneous pmf , to form higher landau levels a uniform pmf is needed @xcite .",
    "this is in fact the main challenge @xcite for the implementation of strained graphene , although recently there has been some progress both in experiment @xcite and in theory @xcite .    in the presence of either external magnetic field or deformation ,",
    "the higher energy levels from @xmath6 and @xmath7 points remain degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy is lifted when both strain and magnetic field are present .",

    "the latest experiments @xcite show that it is possible to create a homogeneous pmf of order of a few tesla .",
    "therefore , there is a good chance that the sts / stm measurements of the dirac landau levels similar to that done in ref .",
    "@xcite are now possible on strained graphene .",

    "[ sec : gf - dos ] we provide the definitions of the valley , sublattice and full dos in terms of the green s function decomposed over landau levels .",
    "the corresponding dos are written in section  [ sec : dos - expressions ] as the sums that in the case of the valley dos can be calculated analytically .",
    "the results for the dos in the various regimes are discussed in section  [ sec : results ] and conclusions are given in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we consider gapped monolayer graphene in the continuum approximation described by the effective hamiltonian @xmath21 the full hamiltonian ( [ dirac - hamiltonian ] ) acts on wave function with four components @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote , respectively , @xmath1 and @xmath2 sublattices and we followed the notations of refs .",

    "we also assume that the deformation is a pure shear , so that @xmath39 , and there is no scalar potential term in the hamiltonian .",
