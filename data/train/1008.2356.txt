    "subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are highly evolved low mass stars that have survived core helium ignition ( presumably through the core helium flash ) and now populate the extreme blue end of the horizontal branch .",
    "@xcite reviews the general properties of these stars .",
    "generally , they are expected to have a mass of @xmath10.5 m@xmath2 .",
    "their hot surfaces ( @xmath3 22,000k to 40,000k - * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that they retain a thin ( @xmath4m@xmath2 ) hydrogen surface layer @xcite .",
    "while the general trends of mass and @xmath5 on the horizontal branch are well understood , the origin of the hot sdb stars remains unsettled .",
    "one plausible mechanism by which stars lose all but a small fraction of their hydrogen envelope has been attributed to binary evolution and mass transfer @xcite .    the discovery of multiperiodic pulsating sdb stars @xcite opened up these stars to asteroseismic probing , promising to give us a clearer picture of their current internal structure and , thereby , their origins .",
    "these pulsators , now known as v361  hya stars ( and as ec14026 stars , but often referred to as short period sdbv stars ) , show multiperiodic pulsations with periods ranging from 1.5 to 10 minutes , with most in the shorter period part of that range .",
    "they typically have pulsation amplitudes ( @xmath6 ) of 1 percent and less , with detailed studies revealing a few to dozens of frequencies @xcite .",
    "these periodicities represent nonradial @xmath7-modes of low order .",
    "soon after their discovery , theoretical work by @xcite and collaborators identified the pulsation driving mechanism as cyclical ionization of iron .",
    "furthermore , they showed that for driving to occur , radiative levitation needed to enhance the abundance of iron within the driving region .",
    "their models demonstrate that equilibrium computation of diffusion effects can indeed produce the iron enhancement needed for driving stars at the effective temperatures ( and gravities ) of the v361  hya stars ; see @xcite and @xcite for an overview of driving in sdb stars .",
    "there is a second , related class of pulsating sdb stars , discovered by @xcite .",
    "these stars , known as the v1093her stars ( or pg1716 stars , or long period sdbv stars ) , show longer period pulsations ranging from 45 to 120 minutes or more , and typically have semi  amplitudes lower than 0.2 per  cent @xcite . they are cooler than the v361hya stars , though there is some overlap , and they are most likely @xmath0-mode pulsators @xcite .",
    "a third type are hybrid ( dw  lyn ) pulsators which show both long and short period variations @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the dwlyn stars show much larger pulsation amplitude in the higher - frequency modes , by factors ranging from 5 to 20 or more .    as sdbv stars often pulsate with tens of frequencies , with each frequency probing a slightly different region of the interior , successful application of asteroseismology",
    "has great potential for probing the interiors of these stars .",
    "asteroseismology of pulsating sdb stars can provide determinations of their global properties such as mass and radius .",
    "matching the pulsation frequencies with model values can further constrain their internal structure in terms of the thickness of their surface hydrogen layer and , perhaps , the size of the helium - burning core @xcite and internal rotation profiles @xcite . the mere presence of pulsations",
    "allows testing models of radiative levitation and diffusion in these stars as well @xcite . taken together with spectroscopic analysis , the pulsating sdbv stars may indeed provide the long - sought window into these stars that can reveal their origins as either single stars , or the product of binary evolution @xcite .",
    "continuing challenges for asteroseismology lie in the stability of the observed periodicities , and in the identification of the degree and order of the observed frequencies .",
    "they are generally complicated pulsators , with closely - spaced periodicities that result in beating on time scales of hours to days or even longer .",
    "furthermore , the intrinsic amplitude of certain pulsation frequencies appears to change on the time scales of days to weeks @xcite . to make precise models of these stars , as well as to clearly determine rotation periods of days to months through multiplet splitting , we need to know which periodicities are intrinsic , and which show up in the fourier transform because of amplitude ( or phase ) modulation",
    "these effects are difficult to sort out with ground - based data because of diurnal aliasing , transparency variations and other atmospheric effects . as a result ,",
    "disentangling the presence of closely - spaced ( in frequency ) periodicities from intrinsic amplitude variation has been a challenge for many of the known sdbv stars .",
    "we are still uncertain whether intrinsic amplitude modulation is a ubiquitous feature of sdbv stars .",
    "long , high duty cycle observations of sdbv stars should help us answer these questions .    for their potential as probes of an important and poorly understood phase of stellar evolution",
    ", sdbv stars were included as targets for the asteroseismology survey phase of the _ kepler mission_. the _ kepler _ science goals , mission design , and overall performance are reviewed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "asteroseismology for _ kepler _ is being conducted through the kepler asteroseismic science consortium ( kasc ) .",
    "these data were obtained as part of the survey mode , where short - cadence targets are observed for 30 days each during the first year of the mission    we observed a number of candidate sdb stars during this phase , and have discovered several pulsators .",
    "the target selection process for sdb stars , and results of the first 6 months of the survey phase , are described in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) . in this paper , we present the discovery of a new pulsating sdb star , kepler input catalog ( kic )  010139564 , at @xmath8 , @xmath9 , that shows short - period pulsations and also shows evidence of being a hybrid ( dw  lyn ) star .",
    "our results suggest that many of the periodicities are quite stable in frequency , amplitude , and phase .",
    "some of the periodicities are not as yet fully resolved in frequency , but we anticipate that further data will be able to determine whether their complexities are caused by intrinsic pulsations that are closely spaced in frequency , or are caused by amplitude and/or phase variations",
    ".    the v316hya stars , such as kic010139564 , are in general much rarer than the longer - period v1093her stars . through the first 3/4 of the _ kepler _ asteroseismology survey phase ,",

    "_ magnitude is a broadband magnitude reflecting the colour response of the _ kepler _ photometer , with a central wavelength roughly equivalent to the @xmath10-band and a passband effectively spanning 437 to 897 nm @xcite .",

    "the data were obtained between bjd  2455002 and 2455033 ( 20 june - 20 july , 2009 ) . during these @xmath15 days of observations , a total of 45,210 science images were scheduled",
    ". however , spacecraft - related events occasionally result in loss and subsequent reacquisition of fine guidance , which results in individual or short sequences of images being unusable .",
    "in addition , cosmic ray interference and software glitches can result in longer down - times ( as the spacecraft enters `` safe mode '' ) for which no data are available . during this run ,",
    "3,686 images were either not obtained or were unusable .",
    "the photometric data obtained for this target are short cadence data with a time between points of 58.85  s and a duty cycle ( within the 58.85  s window ) of 92 percent @xcite . because of the gaps during the run , and other small deviations in the sampling rate",
    ", we determined an effective nyquist frequency of 8496.20  @xmath16hz by the symmetry in the power spectrum at frequencies surrounding this value .",
    "raw and corrected photon counts are provided by the data pipeline .",
    "the `` corrected '' flux values included a preliminary estimate of the contamination from a nearby ( assumed constant ) star that contributes light to the 4 arc second square pixel in the focal plane .",
    "this correction subtracts a constant flux , which increases the resulting fractional amplitude of variations for the target star . for this data",
    "set , the estimated contamination fraction is 0.6 ( that is 40 per  cent of the flux from the target and 60 per  cent from background or foreground stars ) . at this time we do not have data on the contaminating source , but we recognize that it could perhaps be variable , and contribute to peaks in the power spectrum .",
    "we expect that the contamination estimate ( and the properties of the source ) will be determined in the future , but for this work we report results for the raw fluxes .",
    "_ kepler _ data on this star were provided with times in barycentric corrected julian days , and flux .",
    "variations of the normalized `` raw '' flux from the mean ( of 1 ) are shown in the light curve in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "note the gap during the data that corresponds to a safing event .",
    "amplitudes are given as parts - per - thousand ( or milli - modulation amplitude , mma ) , with 10  mma corresponding to 1.0 per  cent .",
    "since some contamination by background sources is included ( see earlier discussion ) the intrinsic pulsation amplitude is greater than this .",
    "future processing ( with an accurate estimate of contamination ) should provide a more realistic absolute amplitude .",
    "the short period variations are clearly seen in the light curve - in fact , much of the observed width of the light curve in the top panel is a result of the pulsational modulation .",
    "this is apparent when examining the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , which shows a periodic variation of approximately 175 seconds , with a peak - to - peak variation of 30  mma .",
    "note that at the time of this writing the pipeline for reducing _ kepler _",
    "short cadence data is still being fine - tuned and tested . as a result , it is possible that some frequencies ( and likely that the pulsation amplitudes ) could be affected by the current _ kepler _ reduction pipeline with differing results in subsequent data releases as the process is improved .",
    "the beauty of data from the _ kepler _ spacecraft is that we get nearly continuous data acquired from a single instrument in a uniform manner . as such",
    ", analysis can proceed in a straightforward way .",
    "we begin with a standard fourier transform / temporal spectrum of the entire light curve up to the nyquist frequency of @xmath17hz .",
    "the main frequency range showing oscillations is from 5000 to 7000  @xmath16hz .",
    "this region is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] .    one point of concern for short period sdbv stars is that the sampling rate places the nyquist frequency at @xmath18hz , meaning that periods shorter than 117.7 seconds lie beyond the nyquist frequency . this can be an issue as a many sdbv stars have pulsation frequencies beyond that range @xcite .",
    "shorter periods will be mirrored across the nyquist frequency into the lower frequency domain , creating spurious frequencies of intrinsic variability to the star .",
    "in addition , since the oscillation frequencies are relatively close to the nyquist frequency , and data are obtained by integration over the short - cadence interval of 58.8 seconds , the amplitudes that appear in the temporal spectrum are reduced below the intrinsic amplitude .",
    "this reduction factor is approximately 25 per  cent for the shortest period frequency , and 13 per  cent for the periodicities near 170 - 180 seconds .",
    "also , though the data we examined were _ kepler _ short cadence ( sc ) data sampled every 58.84 seconds , the spacecraft also supplies long - cadence ( lc ) data with intervals of 30 times the sc rate .",
    "some part of the process by which the lc data are output affects the sc data by creating artefact peaks at multiples of the lc frequency of @xmath19hz @xcite .",
    "this artefact is not well characterized , but it is often most noticeable at higher harmonics that can impact the analysis of the short period sdbv stars .",
    "we examined data on many stars obtained during this same observing period as kic010139564 , and detected common artefact peaks at 3965 , 4531 , 5098 , and 5664  @xmath16hz .",
    "therefore , we do not further consider periodicities at these frequencies in kic010139564 .",
    "we estimate the significance of peaks in the temporal spectrum as in @xcite : in frequency ranges near the range of interest , but that do not contain obvious significant peaks , we find the mean value of the amplitude spectrum ( the square root of the power ) . in this case , in the frequency range of interest ,",
    "the mean value of the temporal spectrum is approximately 37 parts per million , or an amplitude of 0.037  mma . defining that mean as @xmath20",
    ", we adopt an amplitude threshold for significance of 4-@xmath20 .",
    "we note that this is just one option in determining a significance threshold ; a more conservative approach is to define @xmath20 as the mean amplitude of _ peaks _ in the temporal spectrum , since it is the peaks that are used in identifying candidate periodicities .",
    "however , here we will use the mean of the temporal spectrum , rather than the peaks , to remain consistent with prior work .",
    "we therefore adopt a 4  @xmath20 detection limit of 0.15  mma in the range of interest in kic010139564 .    beginning with the highest peaks in the temporal spectrum we successively fit each periodicity ( via non - linear least squares ) in the time domain , and then removed each in the time domain , progressing down to the 4-@xmath20 detection limit . in this procedure",
    ", we did not fit peaks that were within the frequency resolution limit of previously removed periodicities , nor did we fit peaks that were not visible in the original power spectrum .",
    "the frequency resolution of the data is formally @xmath21hz , which corresponds to the reciprocal of the time span of the data .",
    "the prewhitening procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] . in this figure",
    ", the top panel shows the original temporal spectrum covering the region where most of the periodicities were found .",
    "the middle panels show the residuals after removal of seven and then nine high - amplitude frequencies , and the bottom panel has 22 frequencies removed ( including two frequencies outside of the illustrated range , and one at the position of the instrumental artefact at 5098  @xmath16hz .",

    "note that the vertical scale changes with each panel.,width=317 ]    in this star , there are at least four periodicities with amplitudes which would make them easily detectable from the ground .",
    "however , the bulk of the pulsations have amplitudes below usual single - site earth - based detection limits for a 16th magnitude star observed with a 1 - 2 m class telescope . the solution to our fit , listing frequencies , periods , and amplitudes",

    "there are crowded regions where the periodicities are closely spaced or even unresolved at the current resolution of 0.38  @xmath16hz .",
    "the crowding is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] . as in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] the horizontal ( blue ) line is the 4-@xmath20 detection limit and the arrows indicate the positions of various periodicities that we included in the fit . each vertical panel shows a @xmath24hz region with the top panels showing the original ft , the middle panels are prewhitened by the highest amplitude frequency in the region .",

    "the bottom panels show the regions after prewhitening at the indicated frequencies .",
    "the bottom panels are plotted on the same vertical scale , but the others have scales to optimize the visibility of peaks . despite having 30.5 days of nearly continuous data ,",
    "there remain at least three areas of unresolved periodicities .",
    "many pulsating sdb stars show frequencies that are higher than the nyquist frequency present in the _ kepler _ sc data .",
    "furthermore , large - amplitude pulsators often show harmonics of the main pulsation peaks which can have high frequencies . and @xmath12 that is very similar to kic010139564 and is useful comparison .",
    "pg  1325 + 101 has a dominant pulsation mode at 7255.5  @xmath16hz and its harmonic at 14,511  @xmath16hz .",
    "it also shows other periodicities ranging from 5960 to 10,545@xmath16hz . ] in this star , the first harmonic of f8 should be at a frequency of 11520.26  @xmath16hz , which is 3024.26  @xmath16hz above the nyquist frequency .",
    "thus an alias of the harmonic would appear at @xmath25  @xmath16hz , or 5471.94  @xmath16hz .",
    "there is indeed a peak in table[tab01 ] at that frequency .",
    "thus we identify f6 as the ( aliased ) first harmonic of f8 .",
    "similarly , high - amplitude sdb pulsators sometimes show periodicities at linear combinations of strong pulsation modes .",
    "for the periodicities in this star , frequency sums will also be above the nyquist frequency .",
    "we see one example of this ( noted in table [ tab01 ] ) : the sum of f8 and f9 lies above the nyquist , and its alias peak lies precisely ( well within our errors ) where f5 is found .",
    "thus we conclude that f5 and f6 result from non - linear behavior of f8 and f9 .",
    "similar ties to the dominant f8 mode link f3 and f10 ( i.e. the alias of @xmath26 lies at precisely f10 ) and f2 and f11 ( the alias of @xmath27 lies within 0.11  @xmath16hz of f11 ) .",
    "because of the rather low nyquist frequency for this star , and the complex structure of the temporal spectrum in the region of f2 and f3 , it is difficult to determine , with confidence , which periodicities represent oscillation modes , which are combination frequencies , and which might be aliases of `` true '' peaks at higher frequencies . we hope that continued _ kepler _ observations will resolve some of these ambiguities , but higher  cadence ground  based photometry will also be needed .    to summarize",
    ", we find 20 individual periodicities through a temporal spectrum / least squares fitting procedure , with 19 distributed nonuniformly across the range of frequencies expected for an short - period sdbv star . of those ,",
    "at least two and perhaps four or more represent harmonics and linear combinations of the stronger periodicities , aliased across the nyquist frequency .",
    "we find a single low - frequency periodicity at @xmath28hz that is within the frequency range seen in the long - period sdbv stars .",
    "thus , kic  010139654 appears to be a hybrid sdb pulsator ( though there is a small chance that this periodicity could be caused by the contaminating source ) . in the next section ,",
    "we examine the periodicities further to see if we can determine if they are all independent oscillation modes , or if some of the closely - spaced peaks are the signature of slow amplitude and/or phase modulation .",
    "for successful asteroseismic analysis , the observations need to provide determination of ( or useful constraints on ) the modes of oscillation represented by the observed periodicities .",
    "this includes a determination of the degree @xmath29 of the oscillation mode .",
    "the mode frequencies themselves are described by spherical harmonics determined by the quantum numbers @xmath29 , the mode order @xmath30 , and ( if rotation is present ) the azimuthal quantum number @xmath31 .",
    "when rotation is present , it can readily reveal the value of @xmath29 if all @xmath32 multiplets are present . from a stellar seismology perspective , this was demonstrated quite clearly in early ground - based networked observations of pulsating white dwarfs ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but has been used extensively for other compact pulsators as well ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "series photometry rarely uncovers modes with @xmath33 , so the multiplet structure should be well defined - unless the rotational splitting is larger than the spacing between modes with successive @xmath30 , as can be the case in @xmath34  scuti stars ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in sdb stars",
    ", we expect that their rotation rates are slow enough @xcite that such overlaps should not be a problem @xcite except in some extreme cases @xcite . for slow rotators , rotationally - split multiplets should be nearly equally spaced in frequency .",
    "yet such multiplets are seldom seen in sdbv stars .",
    "this is where _ kepler _ data should be most useful , as it should clearly resolve rotationally split multiplets in sdb stars even if they have rotation periods of months .",
    "however , data from the survey phase spanned only 30.5 days and so to resolve any multiplets , the rotation period would need to be shorter than that .    we find no obvious multiplets in the periodicities of kic010139564 . with a formal resolution of 0.38  @xmath16hz , the smallest barely - resolved spacings that we find are 0.5 to 0.6  @xmath16hz",
    "hence we can state that the data are consistent with a rotation period corresponding to @xmath35 about 20 days or longer ( @xmath36hz ) .",
    "that said , the amplitude of @xmath37 multiplets does depend on the inclination of the rotation axis to the line of sight , so if the axis is pointing towards the earth the splitting would be at very small amplitude compared to the central peak .",
    "there are regions where the pulsations are clearly unresolved and these regions are the most likely places to discern multiplets .",
    "we will need to wait for additional _ kepler _ data to see if these regions resolve into multiplets .",
    "without mode identifications via multiplets , we can , as a weak overall constraint , appeal to another property of sdb oscillations  the density of periodicities within a frequency range .",
    "matching the observed @xmath5 and @xmath12 with a stellar model allows us to estimate the number of available mode frequencies within the observed range .",
    "in resolved sdbv stars , we sometimes observe many more pulsation frequencies than @xmath38 , 1 , and 2 can provide , independent of the number of inferred @xmath39 modes . if higher @xmath29 modes contribute to the observed number of periodicities , they must have a higher intrinsic amplitude than the lower @xmath29 modes because of the large degree of geometric cancellation @xcite .",
    "models appropriate for kic  010139654 , such as those in @xcite for pg  1325 + 101 ( which has similar values for @xmath5 and @xmath12 ) , show roughly one overtone ( @xmath30 ) per @xmath29 degree per 850  @xmath16hz . under normal",
    "observing conditions , this would supply three to four modes per 1000  @xmath16hz ( @xmath40 ) without invoking higher @xmath41 values and if no multiplet structure is present .",
    "for kic  010139564 , the peaks f1 to f17 in table  [ tab01 ] span slightly more than @xmath23hz . if the closely - spaced periodicities are considered as multiplets of one overtone , then 10 modes remain , which can not be accommodated by low @xmath29 modes and @xmath42 modes , recognizing that @xmath42 modes suffer less geometric cancelation than @xmath43 modes for most @xmath31 values @xcite , the number of modes per 1000  @xmath16hz rises to 6 . ]",
    "the amplitudes of the _ kepler _ periodicities in table  [ tab01 ] span nearly a factor of 70 , so that it is possible that the lower - amplitude periodicities might have @xmath33 . if further _ kepler _",
    "observations span one year , and the modes remain stable , the noise level will be reduced by a factor of 3 or more , and if higher @xmath29 modes are present we might hope to see them .      if pulsating sdb stars are observed over an extended time period ,",
    "it is common to detect amplitude variability in many , if not all , of the pulsation frequencies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "variations on time scales of days to weeks sometimes appear in clearly resolved pulsation spectra where mode beating can not be the cause @xcite . given the limitations of ground  based observations , in most cases long - term variability can not be securely attributed to beating between pulsations , and could also result from intrinsic amplitude or phase modulations .    as previously mentioned , a true strength of _ kepler _ data is that we have nearly continuous , single - instrument data which can be examined for amplitude and phase stability .",
    "we broke the data up into six 5-day spans , and computed an averaged temporal spectrum of these six shorter runs to obtain estimates of the position of the centroid of pulsation `` power '' at each of 7 cleanly separated regions in the averaged temporal spectrum .",
    "we then used those 7 frequencies ( flagged with asterisks in table  [ tab01 ] ) as fixed quantities to examine them for phase and amplitude stability over two ",

    "the spacings hinted at above , based not on the least - squares fits in table  [ tab01 ] but on the beating pattern , are all around 0.6 to 0.8  @xmath16hz - roughly twice the frequency resolution of the data .",
    "if we attribute these splittings to rotation , then we can suggest a tentative value for the rotation period of approximately 16 - 20 days for kic010139564 .",
    "clearly a longer run is needed to firmly resolve these peaks and confirm that they are indeed multiplets .",
    "given the current data , the best case we find for a periodicity that has an intrinsic variation is the region around 5287.3  @xmath16hz .",
    "this shows phase variation on a time scale longer than the span of observation .",
    "the amplitude varies quasiperiodically with a period roughly 0.75 times the observation span , but on a different ( shorter ) time scale than the phase variation . in the temporal spectrum",
    ", this is a region where nlls fitting failed , and residual power remained after prewhitening . given the phase and amplitude variations seen in the data , we suspect that this mode shows intrinsic amplitude and phase instability , unlike the other strong periodicities in this star .",
    "the periodicity labelled f0 in table [ tab01 ] is notable for being in the frequency range observed in the v1093her stars , and near the low - frequency periodicities in the hybrid ( dw  lyn ) pulsators .",
    "this single periodicity , with an amplitude of 0.45  mma is the smallest - amplitude variation seen in this frequency range for hybrid subdwarf b pulsators . in the other members of this class ,",
    "the amplitude ratio between the short and long period modes is in the range from 5 to 20 or more . in this star ,",
    "the ratio is a factor of 23 , which is consistent with that seen in the known hybrid pulsators .",
    "[ fig06 ] shows the temporal spectrum in the low frequency range surrounding f0 , along with the time dependence of the pulsation amplitude and phase ( computed in the same manner as for the short period modes ) .",
    "a few things are notable about this mode .",
    "first , it seems to be a single oscillation mode - fitting a single sinusoid removes the temporal spectrum peak and leaves no residuals that can be distinguished from noise .",
    "it remains visible through the entire 30.5 day interval , and maintains phase ( within the errors ) .",
    "however , there is a possible trend towards decreasing amplitude over most of the observing interval . with further monitoring",
    ", we hope to determine if this mode will remain visible .",
    "interestingly , with the spectroscopically determined @xmath5 of 32,500k , kic010139564 is significantly hotter than the other hybrid pulsators .",
    "finally , we add that there is a slim chance that this periodicity may be contributed by the contaminating source  if nature is being perverse .",
    "we present results from a study of the first _ kepler _ data on a newly - discovered pulsating subdwarf b star that shows mostly short - period pulsations characteristic of the v361  hya stars , along with a single oscillation at a frequency characterstic of the v1093her stars .",
    "thus kic010139564 may be a member of the hybrid sdb pulsator class .",
    "the _ kepler _ data have realized the potential to obtain a nearly uninterrupted time series of photometric data for this type of pulsator that spans over 15,000 pulsation cycles .",
    "previous ground - based efforts have demonstrated that such data are essential for overcoming aliasing issues , caused by gaps and the necessity of using multiple instruments on varied apertured telescopes from the ground .",
    "the science questions raised by ground - based attempts at photometry of these stars can be addressed directly with _ kepler _ data .",
    "these data have allowed us to confidently detect 21 periodicities , a few of which may be linear combination frequencies .",
    "at least one of the main periodicities remains unresolved , but it is not yet clear whether we are seeing beating or stochasitic variations .",
    "residual power indicates the presence of possible pulsations below the current detection limit . as such , with longer duration _ kepler _ observations , we can anticipate finding more periodicities at even lower amplitudes .",
    "_ kepler _ can place much more stringent upper limits on pulsation amplitudes in these stars than we can achieve from ground - based data , so we can also hope to determine if ground - based observations of these stars that reveal simple pulsators have been limited by a higher detection threshold .",
    "we also anticipate resolving rotationally - split multiplets , which will add stringent observational constraints to theoretical models .",
    "the data presented here confirms the potential of _ kepler _ for sdb asteroseismology .",
    "kic010139564 has a frequency spectrum that is as rich as ( or richer than ) possible for low - degree modes only , and there is still more to come .",
    "we anticipate further , longer - duration observation during the second year of operations , when _ kepler _ will no longer be in survey mode .",
