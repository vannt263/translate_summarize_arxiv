    "qcd is a key component of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "it gives us a rich spectrum of bound states of quarks and gluons whose properties are predictable from qcd if we can solve the theory .",
    "qcd is strongly coupled in this regime , however , and we need the non - perturbative techniques of lattice qcd to do this from first principles .",
    "most ( but not all ) questions which lattice qcd can address require calculations with a precision of a few percent to answer them .",
    "these include the spectrum of hadrons , their internal structure and decay rates .",
    "in particular , the hunt for internal inconsistencies in the standard model which could lead to new physics requires calculations of hadronic weak matrix elements to 2 - 3% to match the experimental errors that will become possible .",
    "figure  [ figuni ] shows the recent status of the combined experimental and theoretical efforts to pin down the vertex of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa unitarity triangle  @xcite .",
    "the different circular constraints on the vertex come from different decay rates of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons and are found by dividing experimental rates by theoretical results obtained in lattice qcd .",
    "the current constraints are strongly limited by current lattice qcd errors of around 20% .",
    "lattice qcd is hard and numerically very expensive .",
    "recent progress  @xcite has at last made precision calculations look possible and we will concentrate on that work and its implications in this review .",
    "lattice qcd calculations proceed by the discretisation of a 4-d box of space - time into a lattice .",
    "the qcd lagrangian is then discretised onto that lattice . the spacing between the points of the lattice , @xmath2 , is @xmath3 0.1fm in current calculations and the length of a side of the box is @xmath4 3.0fm .",
    "thus our simulations can cover energy scales from @xmath3 2 gev down to @xmath3 100 mev .",
    "the feyman path integral is evaluated numerically in a two - stage process . in the first stage sets of gluon fields ( ` configurations ' )",
    "are created which are representative ` vacuum snapshots ' . in the second stage ,",
    "quarks are allowed to propagate on these background gluon field and hadron correlators are calculated .",
    "the dependence of the correlators on lattice time is exponential . from the exponent",
    "the masses of hadrons of a particular @xmath5 can be extracted , and from the amplitude , simple matrix elements .",
    "qcd as a theory has a number of unknown parameters , the overall dimensionful scale of qcd ( @xmath6 the bare coupling constant ) and the bare quark masses . to make predictions ,",
    "these parameters must be fixed from experiment . in lattice",
    "qcd we do this by using one hadron mass for each parameter .",
    "the quantity which is equivalent to the overall scale of qcd on the lattice is the lattice spacing .",
    "lattice calculations are hard and time - consuming .",
    "progress has occurred in the last thirty years through gains in computer power but also , often more importantly , through gains in calculational efficiency and physical understanding .",
    "one particular area which revolutionised the field from the mid-1980s was the understanding of the origin of discretisation errors and their removal by improving the lattice qcd lagrangian .",
    "discretisation errors appear whenever equations are discretised and solved numerically .",
    "they manifest themselves as a dependence of the physical result on the unphysical lattice spacing . in lattice",
    "qcd , as elsewhere , they are corrected by the adoption of a higher order discretisation scheme .",
    "the complication in a quantum field theory like qcd is the presence of radiative corrections to the coefficients in the higher order scheme which must be determined ( using perturbation theory , for example  @xcite )",
    ".    physical understanding of heavy quark physics on the lattice has also made a huge difference to the feasibility of calculating matrix elements relevant to the @xmath0 factory programme on the lattice .",
    "the use of non - relativistic effective theories requires the lattice to handle only scales appropriate to the physics of the non - relativistic bound states and not the ( large ) scale associated with the @xmath7 quark mass .",
    "@xmath0 physics is now one of the areas where lattice qcd can make most impact .",
    "one area which has remained problematic , but which this year s results have addressed successfully , is the handling of light quarks on the lattice . in particular",
    "the problem is that of how to include the dynamical ( sea ) @xmath8 quark pairs that appear as a result of energy fluctuations in the vacuum .",
    "we can safely ignore @xmath9 quarks in the vacuum because they are so heavy , but we know that light quark pairs have significant effects , for example in screening the running of the coupling constant and in generating zweig - allowed decay modes for unstable mesons .    because quarks are fermions , they can not be simulated directly on the computer , but must be ` integrated out ' of the feynman path integral .",
    "this leaves an qcd lagrangian in terms of gluon fields which includes ln(det(@xmath10 ) ) where @xmath10 is an enormous ( @xmath11 ) sparse matrix .",
    "the inclusion of dynamical quarks is then numerically very expensive , particularly as the quark mass is reduced towards the small values which we know the @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks have",
    ".    many calculations even today use the ` quenched approximation ' in which the light quark pairs are ignored .",
    "results then suffer from a systematic error of @xmath14(20% ) .",
    "a serious problem with the quenched approximation is the lack of internal consistency which means that the results depend on the hadrons that were used to fix the parameters of qcd .",
    "this ambiguity plagues the lattice literature .",
    "other calculations have included 2 flavours of degenerate dynamical quarks , i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath13 , but with masses 10 - 20@xmath15 the physical ones .",
    "this approximation is better than the quenched approximation but large uncertainties remain because the @xmath16 quark is omitted .",
    "results must also be extrapolated to the physical @xmath17 quark mass and chiral perturbation theory is a good tool for this .",
    "however , chiral perturbation theory only works well if the @xmath17 quark mass is light enough and , for errors at the few percent level , this means less than @xmath18 .",
    "this has been impossible to achieve in most calculations .",
    "new results this year  @xcite have included @xmath19 and @xmath16 quarks in the vacuum , with light enough @xmath17 masses to perform accurate chiral extrapolations .",
    "the results use a new discretisation of the quark action - the numerically fast improved staggered formalism .",
    "this formalism is well - matched to the supercomputing power of a few tflops that is currently achievable .",
    "the starting point for the staggered quark formalism is the naive discretisation of the dirac quark action onto a lattice .",
    "this action has good features : chiral symmetry and discretisation errors that appear only as the square and higher powers of the lattice spacing .",
    "the naive discretisation suffers from the notorious doubling problem , however .",
    "a single quark species on the lattice gives rise to @xmath20 quark species , or tastes , on a 4-d lattice .",
    "the additional tastes appear around the edges of the brillioun zone , where @xmath21 , as copies of a @xmath22 quark .",
    "this would not be a problem if there were no interaction between the different tastes since the quark action would then fall apart into 16 different pieces in an appropriate basis and we could take @xmath23 in simulations to give the effect of 1 quark flavour .    there is interaction between the different tastes , however .",
    "it is mediated by highly virtual gluons , with momenta around @xmath24 .",
    "a quark of one taste can absorb or emit such a high momentum gluon and turn into a quark of another taste .",
    "the effects of this taste - changing interaction are quite severe for the naive action , giving rise to large discretisation errors ( even though formally of @xmath14@xmath25 ) and large perturbative renormalisation factors , e.g. for the quark mass , when translating from the lattice scheme to the continuum .",
    "the degeneracy in mass of mesons made from quarks of different taste is lost .",
    "this is most noticeable for the pions because there is a light goldstone boson .",
    "because the taste - changing interaction is a high momentum one it can be understood in lattice perturbation theory .",
    "in particular , the effects can be significantly improved by suppressing the coupling of quarks to gluons of momenta @xmath24 in any direction .",
    "this is achieved by ` smearing ' the gluon field in the action in a particular way  @xcite , and can be thought of as part of the standard symanzik programme for systematically removing discretisation errors from lattice actions .",
    "it is simple to ` stagger ' the naive action and its improved variant to remove an exact degeneracy of a factor of 4 in tastes which arises from the spin degree of freedom .",
    "this results in an action with 4 doublers which can be simulated on the lattice using @xmath26 per flavour .",
    "it is very fast numerically because there is only one spin degree of freedom per site and the eigenvalues of @xmath10 are well behaved .",
    "this is what has allowed the milc collaboration to generate ensembles of configurations which include @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath16 quarks in the vacuum with much more realistic masses than before  @xcite .",
    "some worries remain about potential non - locality in the action as the result of taking the fourth root .",
    "however , this causes no problem in perturbative qcd where a simple power series in @xmath27 is obtained for an action with @xmath28 .",
    "stringent non - perturbative tests are also then needed .",
    "luckily these tests are possible in this formalism with present day computers because of its speed , and are exactly the calculations required to test ( lattice ) qcd .",
    "the results , shown in the next section , speak for themselves .",
    "the milc collaboration have made sets of ensembles of gluon field configurations which include 2 degenerate light dynamical quarks ( @xmath29 ) and 1 heavier one ( @xmath16 )  @xcite . taking the @xmath12 and @xmath13 masses",
    "the same makes the lattice calculation much faster and leads to negligible errors in isospin - averaged quantities .",
    "the dynamical @xmath16 quark mass is chosen to be approximately correct based on earlier studies ( in fact the subsequent analysis shows that it was slightly high and further ensembles are now being made with a lower value ) .",
    "the dynamical @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks take a range of masses down as low as a sixth of the ( real ) @xmath30 .",
    "the sets of ensembles divide into two different values of the lattice spacing , 0.13fm and 0.09fm , and the spatial lattice volume is @xmath31 , reasonably large .",
    "analysis of hadronic quantities on these ensembles has been done by the milc and hpqcd collaborations  @xcite .",
    "there are 5 bare parameters of qcd relevant to this analysis : @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the lattice spacing takes the place of @xmath34 in lattice qcd .",
    "it is important that these parameters are fixed using the masses of ` gold - plated ' hadrons , i.e. hadrons which are well below their strong decay thresholds .",
    "such hadrons are well - defined experimentally and theoretically and should be accurately calculable in lattice qcd . using them to fix parameters will not then introduce unnecessary additional systematic errors into lattice results for other quantities .",
    "this has not always been done in past lattice calculations , particularly in the quenched approximation .",
    "it becomes an important issue when lattice qcd is to be used as a precision calculational tool .",
    "we use the radial excitation energy in the @xmath35 system ( i.e. the mass splitting between the @xmath36 and the @xmath35 ) to fix the lattice spacing and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 to fix the quark masses .",
    "we can then focus on the calculation of other gold - plated masses and decay constants .",
    "if qcd is correct and lattice qcd is to work it must reproduce the experimental results for these quantities precisely . figure  [ ratio ] shows that this indeed works for the unquenched calculations with @xmath19 and @xmath16 quarks in the vacuum .",
    "a range of gold - plated hadrons are chosen which range from decay constants for light hadrons through heavy - light masses to heavyonium .",
    "this tests qcd in different regimes in which the sources of systematic error are very different and stresses the point that qcd predicts a huge range of physics with a small set of parameters .    ( 10 - 20% ) . ]    references  @xcite give more details on the quantities shown in figure  [ ratio ] . here",
    "we will discuss some of these .",
    "figure  [ ups ] shows the radial and orbital splittings in the @xmath41 ( @xmath35 ) system for the quenched approximation ( @xmath42 = 0 ) and with the dynamical milc configurations with 3 flavours of dynamical quarks .",
    "our physical understanding of the @xmath35 system is very good and there are a lot of gold - plated states well below decay thresholds , which makes it a valuable system for lattice qcd tests .",
    "we use the standard lattice nrqcd effective theory for the valence @xmath7 quarks , which takes advantage of the non - relativistic nature of the bound states .",
    "the lattice nrqcd action is accurate through @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the velocity of the @xmath7 quark in its bound state .",
    "this means that spin - independent splittings , such as radial and orbital excitations , are simulated through next - to - leading - order and should be accurate to @xmath3 1% .",
    "thus the test of qcd using these splittings is a very accurate one .",
    "the fine structure in the spectrum is only correct through leading - order at present and more work must be done to bring this to the same level and allow tests against , for example , the splittings between the different @xmath45 states  @xcite .",

    "the lattice spacing was fixed from the radial excitation energy i.e. the splitting between the @xmath36 and the @xmath35 and the @xmath7 quark mass was tuned to get the @xmath35 mass correct .",
    "the right hand plot shows these splittings plotted as a function of the bare dynamical @xmath17 quark mass for several ensembles of milc configurations .",

    "the left - hand plot of figure  [ milcmn ] shows very encouraging signs that an answer in agreement with experiment will be found  @xcite .",
    "there is a clear sign of dependence on the lattice spacing , however , which will have to be taken into account .",

    "it is important to realise that accurate lattice qcd results are not going to be obtainable in the near future for every hadronic quantity of interest .",
    "what these results show is that ` gold - plated ' quantities should now work .",
    "gold - plated hadrons are those well below decay threshold for strong decays .",
    "unstable hadrons , or even those within 100 mev or so of zweig - allowed decay modes , have a strong coupling to their real or virtual decay channel which is not correctly simulated on the lattice .",
    "the problem is that , with the lattice volumes being used , the allowed non - zero momenta are typically greater than 400 mev and this significantly distorts the decay channel contribution .",
    "much larger simulations will be necessary to handle these hadrons .",
    "gold - plated hadrons include : @xmath48 , @xmath1 , @xmath61 , @xmath58 , @xmath62 , @xmath35 , @xmath0 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 etc .",
    "the following are _ not _ gold - plated : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , pentaquarks , glueballs and hybrids in general .",
    "lattice calculations will not get the masses right for non - gold - plated hadrons even when light dynamical quarks are included .",
    "this does not preclude lattice calculations giving useful qualitative results and insight but these points should be borne in mind for any quantitative comparison .",
    "figure  [ milcmn ] also shows the spectrum of @xmath58 states obtained on the dynamical milc configurations  @xcite .",
    "the valence @xmath74 quarks are simulated using an effective theory which , in a similar way to the @xmath35 above , should be accurate for spin - independent splittings and not quite so accurate for fine structure in the spectrum .",
    "the hyperfine splitting between the @xmath58 and @xmath75 , for example is currently missing a radiative correction to the term in the action proportional to the spin coupling to the chromo - magnetic field . this is being calculated in lattice perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "also shown are the scalar and axial vector orbital excitations compared to the recent experimental results for these mesons .",
    "the lattice calculation is giving a high result , albeit with large statistical errors at present .",
    "however , a high result is consistent with the fact that these mesons are not gold - plated and the lattice calculation does not currently include correctly the coupling to their decay modes .    ,",
    "as a function of valence @xmath17 quark mass in units of @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the grey squares are from the dynamical milc ensembles including @xmath19 and @xmath16 dynamical quarks  @xcite .",
    "the black diamonds are from the previous best calculation which included 2 flavours of dynamical quarks with masses @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "the straight line is a linear extrapolation for the 2 flavour results , the curve includes the possibility of logarithms from chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this ratio , for physical @xmath17 masses , appears in the ratio of oscillation frequencies for @xmath63 and @xmath77 mesons , which it is hoped to measure experimentally . ]",
    "decay rates which can be accurately calculated for gold - plated hadrons are those in which there is at most one ( gold - plated ) hadron in the final state .",
    "this therefore includes leptonic and semi - leptonic decays and the mixing of neutral @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "luckily there is a gold - plated decay mode available to extract each element ( except @xmath78 ) of the ckm matrix which mixes quark flavours under the weak interactions in the standard model : @xmath79 as described earlier , the determination of the ckm elements and tests of the self - consistency of the ckm matrix are the current focus for the search for beyond the standard model physics and lattice calculations of these decay rates will be a key factor in the precision with which this can be done .",
    "first calculations on the dynamical milc configurations have concentrated on the @xmath0 and @xmath63 leptonic decay rates  @xcite , because these are simplest .",
    "they are parameterised by the decay constants , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and these are an important component of the mixing rate for these mesons , which constrains @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "again one issue in extracting reliable lattice results for @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the chiral extrapolation in the @xmath17 quark mass .",
    "figure  [ wingate ] shows results on the milc configurations for the ratio of @xmath84 plotted against the valence @xmath17 quark mass  @xcite .",
    "the data extend into the region @xmath51 which will allow an accurate chiral extrapolation for the first time .",
    "although the statistical errors are currently rather large , it seems likely that the result for this ratio will be larger than previous estimates based on extrapolations from larger @xmath17 masses , and including only two flavours of dynamical quarks  @xcite .",
    "further calculations of gold - plated matrix elements are in progress  @xcite .",
    "the impact of lattice qcd calculations has been hindered by the difficulty of including a realistic qcd vacuum .",
    "this has led to a level of systematic error far greater than the few percent needed to provide input to tests of the standard model , particularly those testing the ckm matrix at @xmath0 factories .",
    "new results this year look set to herald a brighter future in which accurate calculations , at least for gold - plated quantities , are available from the lattice at last .",
