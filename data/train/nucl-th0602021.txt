    "we should mention here that both potentials provide the qualitatively same energy spectra for the kaonic atoms though they have much different potential depths in the real part .",

    "when we take this value , all the calculated cross sections in this paper have to be reduced by roughly a factor of 2 .",
    "by considering all results described above , we conclude that we need first to have new experimental data which are so accurate that we can identify the existence ( or non  existence ) of the small structures appearing in the theoretical calculations in the kaonic nuclear states energy region .",
    "then , if it exists , we must investigate the origins of the structures very carefully in order to conclude the existence ( or non  existence ) of the kaonic nuclear states decisively in the studies of the in  flight ( @xmath0 ) reactions on the targets like c and o.    finally , we would like to add a few words for the perspectives in formation reactions of kaonic nuclear states .",

    "@xcite , it may be interesting to consider lighter nuclei as targets . in any cases ,",
    "we need to evaluate the effects of the nuclear structure changes to the reaction cross sections , which have not been included in our calculations so far .",
    "the possibilities of the significant changes of the nuclear structure due to kaon were reported not only for lighter nuclei  @xcite but also for heavier nuclei like c and o  @xcite .",
    "the possible changes of the nuclear structures may be expected to reduce the formation cross sections of kaonic nuclear states significantly because of the suppression due to the nuclear transition form factor . on the other hand ,",
    "a kaon wavefunction confined in smaller spatial dimension is expected to be able to bear the larger momentum transfer in the ( @xmath0 ) reactions , and helps to make the cross sections larger .",
    "thus , the quantitative evaluation is quite necessary in order to conclude the size of the observed formation cross sections in refs .",
