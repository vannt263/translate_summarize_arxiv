    "magnetic frustration in spin systems is responsible for complex phase diagrams due to the competition between states that are very close in energy but exhibit fundamentally different properties  @xcite .",
    "although exotic phases with no magnetic order ( possibly having topological order and fractional excitations ) represent the forefront of present research in the field , understanding complex magnetically ordered phases in quantum spin models remains of great interest as well .",
    "indeed , at present spin liquids are found in only relatively small regions of frustrated spin models , such as the @xmath1-@xmath2 model on the square lattice  @xcite or the heisenberg model on the kagome lattice  @xcite . on the other hand , ordered phases are ubiquitous and represent important examples of correlated states  @xcite .",
    "the first step and simplest approximation in describing these phases is obtained by considering spins as classical variables , thus completely neglecting quantum fluctuations .",
    "this approximation is adequate when the spin @xmath9 is large , e.g. , for half - filled @xmath10 or @xmath11 shells in the presence of a large hund coupling ( mathematically speaking , this approximation becomes exact when @xmath12 ) . in order to include quantum corrections ,",
    "a systematic perturbative approach can be constructed by using the so - called holstein - primakoff transformation  @xcite . here , the first - order terms at the @xmath13 level already contain quantum correlations that correctly describe the low - energy spin - wave spectrum .",
    "in addition , within this scheme , it is possible to obtain rather accurate results for the renormalization of the magnetization due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath13 quantum corrections may also select the correct ground state when the classical ground state is highly degenerate , e.g. , for the @xmath1-@xmath2 model on the square lattice for @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this technique becomes very cumbersome when considering higher corrections beyond @xmath13 .",
    "alternative approaches exist , e.g. , a modified spin - wave theory  @xcite , but they too involve complicated perturbative expansions . therefore , identification of simple variational wave functions is useful to go beyond the spin - wave approximation and capture non - perturbative effects . indeed , this approach has been widely used to study different spin models on frustrated lattices  @xcite .    among frustrated spin models ,",
    "a particularly interesting example is the @xmath1-@xmath2 heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice : @xmath15 where the sums @xmath16 and @xmath17 run over all the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor bonds , respectively ; @xmath18 is the spin operator on site @xmath19 . in the following , we consider @xmath20 and @xmath21 as the two bravais vectors defining the honeycomb lattice .    in recent years , a lot of effort has focused on understanding the phase diagram of this model , mainly in the case of antiferromagnetic heisenberg interactions  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath1-@xmath2 model on the honeycomb lattice has a non - trivial phase diagram even at the classical level , since for @xmath22 the ground state has an infinite degeneracy due to the fact that the wave vector @xmath23 can vary on closed contours in the brillouin zone ; see below  @xcite",
    ". the spin-1/2 quantum model has been the subject of recent works , and was shown to exhibit magnetically disordered regions for sufficiently large frustration , which presumably have plaquette and dimer orders  @xcite .    a closely related model that also exhibits a rich phase diagram is the frustrated spin-1/2 @xmath0 model in the honeycomb geometry : @xmath24 by using the fact that @xmath25 , the spin-1/2 @xmath0 model is equivalent to `` non - interacting '' hard - core bosons with hopping amplitudes @xmath26 and @xmath27 at nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor sites , respectively  @xcite . by using exact diagonalizations on small clusters ,",
    "it was suggested that a disordered spin - liquid phase may appear in a narrow regime of intermediate frustration , in between magnetically ordered antiferromagnetic and collinear phases  @xcite .",
    "this scenario is consistent with variational calculations involving partonic wave functions  @xcite .",
    "however , recent density - matrix renormalization group calculations have instead pointed toward an unexpected ordered phase ( with spin order along the @xmath28-axis , which is equivalent to a charge - density wave in the boson language )  @xcite .",
    "both these scenarios are highly unusual and currently the nature of the ground state for @xmath29 is not understood .",
    "both exact - diagonalization and density - matrix renormalization group studies are done in finite systems with highly constrained geometries .",
    "the complex quantum states that these methods select are in competition with other ordered states , including spirals that are often suggested by the classical analysis .",
    "the stabilization of these spirals may be highly frustrated in finite systems , which generates concerns about extrapolating finite - size results to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore , it is important to carry out a systematic study of these spiral states on large lattices and including quantum fluctuation around classical ground states .",
    "this is the focus of our work .",
    "our approach is based on introducing jastrow wave functions that are particularly suitable to describe magnetically ordered states  @xcite .",
    "these variational states are constructed by applying a long - range jastrow factor , which enables us to account for quantum effects , to classical spin waves with a given wave vector @xmath23 and relative phase @xmath30 between the two spins in the unit cell ( the detailed description is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : wavefunction ] ) .",
    "we show that the best jastrow state may have a @xmath23 vector different from the one that minimizes the classical energy . in general , collinear phases",
    "are highly favored over generic spiral ones . in particular , the nel state with @xmath3 remains stable up to @xmath31 in the heisenberg model and @xmath32 for the @xmath0 model ( to be compared with @xmath33 for the classical model ) . moreover , a collinear state with @xmath5 ( and the other two symmetry - related wave vectors ) is remarkably stable in a wide region of the phase diagram , namely , @xmath34 for the heisenberg model and @xmath35 for the @xmath0 model .",
    "while incommensurate spiral states are clearly defeated for small and intermediate values of @xmath8 , they may survive in a relatively small range of frustration , before the @xmath7 state sets in .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "quantum fluctuations in the spin-1/2 case are expected to be strong enough to substantially change the classical scenario .",
    "we would like to emphasize that we consider only two - body correlations ; higher - order terms have been used to improve both the signs and the amplitudes of variational states in frustrated lattices  @xcite . indeed , while our wave function has the correct signs for the unfrustrated case with @xmath89 ( where a marshall sign rule holds ) , in general it does not reproduce the correct ( and unknown ) sign structure .",
    "we would like also to remark that the variational state explicitly breaks the spin su@xmath90 symmetry of the heisenberg model .",
    "this is apparent from the fact that the order parameter is in the @xmath0 plane , and the jastrow factor contains only the @xmath28 component of the spin operator .    since quantum effects may favor states with a different ordering vector than the one selected by the classical model , we compute the energy by optimizing the jastrow parameters for all non - equivalent spin waves allowed by the particular lattice size and study an extensive range of values of @xmath30 in order to determine the state with the lowest possible energy .",
    "it should be emphasized that not all possible @xmath23 vectors are accessible on finite clusters .",
    "this fact is particularly relevant when considering spirals , which may be frustrated on a given finite lattice ; nonetheless , it is still possible to follow the evolution of the wave vector as a function of the frustrating ratio @xmath8 and to detect the stability of collinear phases .    finally , it is important to note that classical states with generic @xmath23 do not in general possess the underlying rotational invariance of the lattice , i.e.",
    ", pairs of spins along different spatial orientations and the same geometric distance apart might be correlated in different ways . when attempting to build correlations on top of such states , those differences are naturally accounted for in our trial states by considering a jastrow factor with parameters @xmath87",

    "in what follows , we explore the extent to which the classical scenario is modified by quantum fluctuations in the spin-1/2 @xmath0 and heisenberg models .",
    "we determine the spin - ordered variational states for @xmath91 by performing extensive monte carlo simulations for various ( @xmath92)-site clusters ( @xmath93 being the number of unit cells along @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) , with @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ( @xmath104 was simulated for a few selected values of @xmath8 ) .",

    "these results show three remarkable effects of quantum fluctuations : ( i ) a prolongation of the stability of the nel antiferromagnetic phase with @xmath3 up to @xmath32 , ( ii ) the extension of the stability of the collinear state from a point at @xmath114 to an entire region @xmath35 , and ( iii ) the extension of the stability of the @xmath7 state from a point at @xmath115 to an entire region with @xmath116 . in particular , we find that spirals i disappear from the phase diagram and only spirals ii occur in the presence of quantum fluctuations , between the collinear and the @xmath7 states . moreover , quantum fluctuations determine an order - by - disorder lifting of the huge classical degeneracy , the wave vector of spiral phases being always along @xmath69-@xmath52 ( finite - size effects may favor wave vectors that are close to but not exactly along the border zone ) .",
    "unfortunately , even on the @xmath108 cluster there are only two @xmath117 points between @xmath69 and @xmath52 and , therefore , it is extremely difficult to follow the evolution of the wave vector for @xmath118 .",

    "[ fig : energyxy ] , the difference in energy between the competing spirals and the collinear and @xmath7 states is very small .",
    "this suggests the possibility that spirals may disappear altogether in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , that quantum corrections favor spirals with relatively short periods such as the collinear and @xmath7 states .",
    "another possibility is that , as one increases the system size , new spirals will appear between the collinear and @xmath7 states , pushing the stability region of the latter state to higher values of @xmath8 .      in fig .",

    "[ fig : eofqj03](a ) for comparison . figure  [ fig : eofqj03](b ) makes apparent that quantum fluctuations dramatically reduce the dependence of the energy on the wave vectors along these lines . furthermore , and more importantly",
    ", the minimum in the energy is shifted from spirals i ( here along @xmath49-@xmath69 ) to the collinear state with @xmath120 .",

    "we also report the value of @xmath122 in eq .   and the classical prediction for the energy . [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on the heisenberg model ,",
    "the trend is similar to the previous one , even though the actual accuracy is always lower than in the @xmath0 model .",
    "the best variational energies are obtained in the unfrustrated regime ( about @xmath123 ) .",
    "again , the worst accuracy appears for @xmath119 , where a non - magnetic phase is expected to occur in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "then a substantial improvement is obtained for @xmath124 , but from there , the accuracy monotonically deteriorates on increasing the frustrating ratio , still remaining below @xmath125 up to @xmath126 .",
