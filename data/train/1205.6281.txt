    "recently , the study of the behavior of ultracold fermi gases with two imbalanced hyperfine states has opened up an interesting new area in many - body atomic physics . in this connection",
    ", extensive studies have been reported that propose various candidates for the pairing state , including the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state @xcite , the bcs - normal phase separation @xcite , the sarma state @xcite , the p - wave pairing state @xcite and the deformed fermi surface superfluid @xcite .",
    "of central importance is the phase separation of a superfluid ( sf ) paired core surrounded by a polarized normal ( n ) phase , where , in addition to theoretical studies @xcite , important experimental work has been carried out @xcite .",
    "such a phase - separation scenario had been proposed by clogston @xcite and chandrasekhar @xcite long ago , who predicted the occurrence of a first - order transition from the n to the sf state .",
    "an interesting result in this connection is the appearance of a temperature difference between the two phases as a consequence of the blockage of energy transfer across the n - sf interface .",
    "this blockage is due to a sf gap , which causes low - energy normal particles to be reflected from the interface . by studying particle scattering off the interface",
    ", the heat conductivity has been calculated @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a polarized fermi system consisting of two spin species with unequal masses in the presence of hf potentials .",
    "we concentrate on the bcs regime with various interaction strengths and numerically obtain the allowed values of the chemical and hf potentials , as well as the mass ratio @xmath3 .",
    "the functional dependence of the heat conductivity of the n - sf interface on the relevant physical parameters , namely the temperature , the mass ratio , and the interaction strength , is studied in detail .",
    "our focus is on energies slightly above the transmission threshold , because we are considering low temperatures . in our calculations",
    ", we therefore use the approximate low - temperature form of the fermi - dirac distribution and regard the pair potential as temperature - independent .",
    "in particular , we show that the interface conductivity starts to drop with decreasing temperature at the temperature , @xmath0 , where the mean kinetic energy of the particles is just sufficient to overcome the sf gap .",
    "the drop is , thus , a result of the blockage of the energy transfer due to the reflection of particles from the interface and signifies a build - up of temperature difference across the interface .",
    "we obtain @xmath0 as a function of the mass ratio and the interaction strength .",
    "the variation of the heat conductivity , at fixed temperature , with the hf potentials and the imbalance chemical potential is also obtained . finally , we single out the particular case of the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixture ( @xmath4 ) , due to its importance in experimental and theoretical studies @xcite . because the range of relevant temperatures increases for larger values of the mass ratio , here",
    "we take the pair potential to be temperature - dependent and use the exact fermi - dirac distribution instead of its approximate low - temperature form .",
    "we consider a polarized fermi gas consisting of two fermionic species ( imbalanced hyperfine states @xmath5 ) of masses @xmath6 and chemical potentials @xmath7 at sufficiently low temperature .",
    "the @xmath8 interaction is assumed to be a contact interaction characterized by the coupling constant @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) with @xmath11 .",
    "for the superfluid phase we define the species - imbalance chemical potential , @xmath12 , and the average chemical potential , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the superfluid hf potential . for the calculation of transmission coefficients , and hence the heat conductivity ,",
    "we need to obtain the solution of bogoliubov - de gennes equations @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the system may be written as @xmath15\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 are the hf and pair potentials , respectively .",
    "we use the approximation that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are independent of @xmath21 . it is noted that in the superfluid phase ( unlike the normal phase ) all the hf potentials are equal @xcite .",
    "the traditional forms of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) are the fermionic quasiparticle operators ( wavefunctions ) . by using these expressions and the commutation relations between @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    ", one can straightforwardly obtain the bogoliubov - de gennes equations @xmath30u(\\bm{r}\\uparrow)+\\delta v(\\bm{r}\\downarrow)=eu(\\bm{r}\\uparrow)\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta^{\\star}u(\\bm{r}\\uparrow)-[h(\\bm{r}\\downarrow)+u(\\downarrow)]v(\\bm{r}\\downarrow)=ev(\\bm{r}\\downarrow).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one obtains the second set of equations by interchanging @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in the @xmath33-channel , we take @xmath34 for the particle - like and @xmath35 for the hole - like wavefunctions .    to proceed ,",
    "let us take the n - sf interface to be in the @xmath36 plane and introduce the superscript @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) for the solutions in the sf ( n ) phase .",
    "we also introduce @xmath39 $ ] for the n phase , and @xmath40 $ ] for the sf phase , where @xmath41 refers to particle , hole and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) denotes the component of the wave vector @xmath44 parallel ( perpendicular ) to the interface . notice that @xmath45 appears as a subscript ( superscript ) for the n ( sf ) phase throughout our notation .    from the bogoliubov - de",
    "gennes equations we obtain the relations , @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 ( mass ratio ) , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "thus for the n phase we write @xmath51 as for the sf phase , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath56 , etc .",
    "are to be determined by matching the wave functions and their derivatives at @xmath36 , of course @xcite .    denoting @xmath57 , for @xmath58",
    ", particle - like and hole - like excitations both occur in the sf side , but andreev reflection @xcite is forbidden . however , for @xmath59 , we have particle - like and hole - like excitations , as well as normal and andreev reflections @xcite . in other regions ,",
    "the particle has insufficient energy to excite the sf side and , thus , the transmission coefficients vanish .",
    "we , therefore , restrict our attention to the above two regions , which we shall denote by i and ii , respectively .",
    "moreover , our focus is on energies slightly above the transmission threshold ( @xmath60 ) , because we are considering low temperatures .    denoting the @xmath61-component of the current density by @xmath62 , the transmission coefficient is given by @xmath63 , where the superscripts t and i refer to the transmitted and incident quasi - particle current densities , respectively .",
    "the general form of @xmath64 ( for @xmath33-channel ) is @xmath65\\nonumber \\\\ -\\frac{i}{2m_{\\downarrow}}[-v^\\star(\\bm{r}\\downarrow)\\nabla v(\\bm{r}\\downarrow)+v(\\bm{r}\\downarrow)\\nabla v^\\star(\\bm{r}\\downarrow)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the heat conductivity ( for @xmath33-channel ) is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the fermi - dirac distribution , which , in the low temperature limit @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , reduces to @xmath71 ( up to a proportionality constant ) , where @xmath72 the right hand side is the minimal energy attained by the @xmath33 spectra , which is positive ( in order to have a gapped spectrum ) and independent of the hf potentials .    in the mass asymmetric case , analytical calculation of the heat conductivity in the bcs regime ( unlike the deep bcs regime",
    "in which the andreev approximation is valid ) is a formidable task , especially when hf potentials are present .",
    "we , therefore , approach the problem numerically and examine the effect of the hf potentials and mass asymmetry in regions i and ii . we begin by obtaining the allowed range of values for all the relevant parameters in the bcs regime . to this end , we use the following standard relations",
    ". the hf potential of the superfluid phase , obtained by using the fermionic anticommutation relations for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , is given by the number equation @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "similarly , the gap equation is given by @xmath75 the above integrals can be calculated using @xcite",
    "@xmath76^{1/2}}=-\\frac{\\pi}{\\sin \\pi\\lambda}\\:(1+x^{2})^{\\lambda/2}p_{\\lambda}(\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{1+x^{2}}})\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the legendre function . equations ( [ u ] ) and ( [ gap ] ) , thus , yield @xmath78 \\label{range}\\ ] ] where @xmath79^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "since @xmath80 , using ( [ range ] ) we find @xmath81 this relationship determines the allowed values of @xmath82 by fixing @xmath83 in the bcs regime . through ( [ range ] )",
    "we thus find @xmath84 , @xmath14 , @xmath20 , and the latter yields @xmath85 via the clogston limit .",
    "we , therefore , have @xmath86 and @xmath87 as well . in the normal phase we similarly find @xcite @xmath88^{3/2},\\ \\ \\",
    "u(\\downarrow)=-\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}m_{r}a^{5}}{3\\pi}[m_{\\uparrow}(\\mu_{\\uparrow}-u(\\uparrow))]^{3/2 } \\label{us}\\ ] ] which yield the allowed values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 in the bcs regime . for @xmath3 less than a cut - off value @xmath91 ( which depends on the interaction strength ) , we find two solutions for each @xmath92 , satisfying @xmath93 ( for @xmath94 , no real solution exists ) .",
    "since the interactions are attractive the upper bound on the potentials is obvious .",
    "the lower bound implies that the density of the sf phase ( the core region ) exceeds that of the n phase .",
    "this reconciles with the fact that a n - sf interface exists , separating an unpolarized sf from a partially polarized n phase .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath95 for the allowed range of values of @xmath3 in the bcs regime .",
    "the relevant physical parameters in a dilute fermi gas are the temperature , the mass ratio , and the interaction strength .",
    "it is , therefore , important to find how physical quantities depend on these parameters @xcite . for the heat conductivity , ( [ hc ] )",
    "is found to give @xmath96 where @xmath0 is defined by ( [ t ] ) , @xmath97 is the heat conductivity of the n phase , and @xmath98 is the fermi temperature",
    ". the functional forms of @xmath99 and @xmath100 will be discussed shortly .",
    "we note that , as a consequence of ( [ formula ] ) , @xmath101 starts to drop from its maximum value at @xmath102 with decreasing temperature .",
    "this signifies a build up of temperature difference across the interface , which be understood as follows .",
    "according to ( [ t ] ) , at @xmath102 , the mean kinetic energy of the particles is just sufficient to overcome the sf gap .",
    "we , therefore , expect a blockage of energy transfer at lower temperatures , resulting in the reflection of particles from the interface and hence a drop in the interface conductivity .",
    "@xmath0 is an increasing function of @xmath3 , which , for fixed @xmath3 , increases with the interaction strength too ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "as seen , for fixed @xmath103 , the larger the absolute value of @xmath83 ( i.e. , the weaker the interaction ) , the larger is the heat conductivity .",
    "also , in the presence of hf potentials , the maximum value of @xmath105 is almost the same for all @xmath3 for sufficiently weak interactions .",
    "this means that the characteristic relaxation time increases with @xmath3 .",
    "note that for sufficiently high values of the mass ratio , @xmath101 is independent of the interaction strength , provided @xmath106 .        at fixed @xmath107 ,",
    "@xmath101 decreases with increasing @xmath108 , because of the growing interaction strength .",
    "the effect of @xmath85 ( which can be controlled by the species population imbalance ) on @xmath105 is more pronounced in the presence of hf potentials , because the latter affect the threshold line ( @xmath110 ) by changing @xmath111 . however , as seen , the role of @xmath85 diminishes at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "the functional forms of @xmath112 and @xmath0 in ( [ formula ] ) have been determined by the method of least - squares fit .",
    "they are valid for the whole bcs regime and reproduce the above results very accurately : @xmath113\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 the resulting functional dependence of @xmath101 on the temperature and interaction strength is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .          as seen , the role of the potentials becomes more important as the temperature increases .",
    "also , the heat conductivity decreases with @xmath115 , which is understood because of the resulting increase in the scattering length ( and , hence , cross section ) .    as a subsidiary result",
    ", we may also point out that our numerical calculations show that the role of the incident particles ( from the n side ) with energies in region i ( where andreev reflection does not occur ) is much more important in @xmath105 than that of the incident particles / holes with energies in region ii .      here",
    ", we consider in more detail the particular case of the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixture ( @xmath4 ) , due to its importance in experimental and theoretical studies . since @xmath0 increases with @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , for larger values of the mass ratio such as here , the range of relevant temperatures increases .",
    "hence , it would be more appropriate to take the temperature dependence of @xmath20 into account .",
    "we have @xcite @xmath117 where @xmath20 is the zero temperature limit considered in our previous calculations . also , we take the distribution function @xmath68 in ( [ hc ] ) to be the exact fermi - dirac distribution instead of its approximate low - temperature form .",
    "( however , for simplicity , we take hf potentials to be zero . )",
    "we find the following analytic expression for the transmission coefficient of region i : @xmath118^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\times \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{\\chi(\\chi-1)}[(1+m_{r}^{2})(2\\chi-3)+2(m^{2}_{r}-1)\\sqrt{(\\chi-1)(\\chi-2)}]}{\\left[(m_{r}-1)+(\\sqrt{\\chi-2}-\\sqrt{\\chi})[(m_{r}-1)\\sqrt{\\chi}-(m_{r}+1)\\sqrt{\\chi-1}]\\right]^{2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 . by using equations ( [ delta ] ) , ( [ range ] ) , and the definition of @xmath82",
    ", we can obtain the temperature dependence of @xmath120 .",
    "the interface conductivity ( [ hc ] ) is then obtained via numerical interpolation ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "similarly , the functional forms of @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( the maximum values of @xmath101 and @xmath123 , respectively ) have been determined by the method of least - squares fit .",
    "they are @xmath124 fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the graphs of @xmath121 and @xmath122 versus the interaction strength .",
    "it is noteworthy that , since @xmath125 , where the second inequality sign is owing to the fact that @xmath105 is real , the condition for clogston limit ( @xmath126 ) is satisfied more stringently as @xmath3 increases .",
