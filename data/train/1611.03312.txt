    "in order to achieve a better understanding of the fundamental interactions , it is instructive to produce accurate and reliable predictions for the observables that can be measured in the ongoing experimental efforts .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) has been particularly successful in producing valuable and surprisingly accurate predictions .",
    "the experimental confirmation of these predictions provoked inspiration to search for new phenomena .",
    "however , the sm is not a complete and perfect model , in that it is unable to provide adequate explanations for many questions in particle and astrophysics .",
    "one way of addressing these problems is to enlarge the sm with an extended scalar sector .",
    "here we focus on one of the simplest extension of sm by a complex singlet ( csmcs ) @xcite .",
    "such choice for the extension sector have been widely discussed in the literature , see for example the references @xcite .",
    "the csmcs has an additional source of spontaneous cp violation and provides strong enough first - order electroweak phase transition to generate baryon asymmetry of universe ( bau ) .",
    "also in the reference @xcite , it has been argued that to predict an acceptable value for the bau , the smcs should be accompanied with heavy vector quarks ( they are not included here ) . considering a softly broken global u(1 ) symmetry with the potential of the smcs model ,",
    "leads to the so - called constraint smcs ( csmcs ) model .",
    "the model that has been considered here is a part of a larger framework , presented in @xcite , where the extension of the sm by an inert doublet ( with @xmath0 ) and a complex singlet ( cidms ) has been studied , focusing the properties of dark matter .",
    "this model that we consider contains three neutral higgs particles .",
    "we have considered the lightest one to be the 125 gev higgs boson found at the lhc .",
    "the sm - like higgs boson comes mostly from the sm - like su(2 ) doublet , with a small correction from the singlet .",
    "the csmcs contains two additional higgs scalars , @xmath1 and @xmath2 gev , which are taken to be @xmath3 we test the predictions of the sm by collecting precise measurements of observables possibly sensitive to new physics , an example being the campaign to determine the higgs couplings to other sm particles .",
    "then we search of the effects from new particles in colliders , by performing a complete set of high - energy qcd investigations over the lesser known physical territory that is being described by the ssmcs .",
    "it is well - known that the main contribution into the hadronic cross - section of the production of the higgs bosons at the lhc , @xmath4 is the so - called gluon - gluon fusion sub - process , i.e. @xmath5 via a single triangular top - quark loop , see the figure [ fig1 ] part ( a ) . also ,",
    "the higgs boson production accompanied with a single jet or double jets can be traced back to the quark - box loops ( figure [ fig1 ] part ( b ) ) and the quark - pentagon loops ( figure [ fig1 ] part ( c ) ) , respectively . these are , by all means , some higher order corrections to the triangular top - quark loop diagram .",
    "other involving processes ( the @xmath6-fusion sub - process , figure [ fig1 ] part ( c ) , and the @xmath7 bremsstrahlung sub - processes , figure [ fig1 ] parts ( e ) and ( f ) , are expected to produce roughly one tenth of the production rate at the present lhc energies , @xcite ) .",
    "please note that in principle , one have to include the contributions of all quark flavors in such diagrams .",
    "however , limiting our calculations to the top - quark loops can be justified , knowing that the sm higgs boson coupling to the top quark is considerably ( nearly @xmath8 times ) stronger compared to the bottom quark .",
    "this leads to a relative suppression of other quark contributions about 1200 or more .",
    "additionally , in order to have a complete understanding over the dynamics of such processes , one have to account for all of the relevant processes and their higher - order corrections . nevertheless , it has been shown that one can replace such complicated calculation by using a higher - order correction factor ( i.e. the k - factor , @xcite , also see the section [ sec : numeric ] ) . throughout the years numerous theoretical and phenomenological attempts",
    "have been made , trying to explore different aspects and dynamics of the production of the higgs particles at the lhc , within the sm , e.g. the references @xcite .",
    "such calculations are conventionally carried out in the collinear approximation , where the contributing processes are quite complicated even at the lowest order , given the complexity of evaluating the matrix elements of the quark - loops .",
    "however , it is customary to introduce the `` large top - quark mass '' approximation , simplifying the processes ( up to one loop ) through implementing an effective vertex instead of the loop . using this large @xmath9 approximation , the total cross - section of the production of the higgs boson via the @xmath10 sub - process",
    "have been calculated up to the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) qcd accuracy , @xcite .    in the collinear factorization framework ,",
    "the total cross - section of the production of a higgs boson can be written as the partonic cross - section of the involving sub - process ( @xmath11 ) , times the probability of appearing that particular partonic configuration at top of the evolution ladder of the individual hadrons , i.e. , @xmath12      & & \\times \\hat{\\sigma}_{gg \\to h}(x_1,k^2_{1,t}=0,\\mu_1 ^ 2;x_2,k^2_{2,t}=0,\\mu_2 ^ 2 ) .",

    "these functions parametrize the probability of finding a gluon , emitting from the @xmath14th hadron and carrying the fraction @xmath15 of its longitudinal momentum .",
    "@xmath16 is an ultra - violet cutoff , related to the virtuality of the exchanged gluon during the inelastic scattering and @xmath17 are the ( neglected ) transverse momenta of the incoming gluons . omitting the transverse momentum contributions of the incoming partons can seriously lower the precision of the calculations , predominantly in the high center - of - mass events and in the small-@xmath18 regions , @xcite . knowing this have brought up the necessity of introducing some transverse momentum dependent prton distribution functions ( tmd pdf ) , notably the ciafaloni - catani - fiorani - marchesini ( ccfm ) evolution equation @xcite , the balitski - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution equation , @xcite , and the unintegrated parton distribution functions ( updf ) of the @xmath19-factorization , namely the leading order ( lo ) kimber - martin - ryskin ( kmr ) and lo and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) martin - ryskin - watt ( mrw ) formalisms , @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that these updf , specially in the kmr formalism , are very effective in providing successful theoretical descriptions of the existing experimental data , @xcite .    in the present work ,",

    ", we will demonstrate that our framework is capable of producing acceptable predictions for the know sm higgs boson . to do this",
    ", we have calculated the inclusive total cross - section of the production of this particle and compared the results with the existing predictions from other theoretical frameworks as well as the experimental data from the cms and the atlas collaborations , the references @xcite .",
    "afterwards , we present our analysis for the extra higgs particles , going through the benchmarks of the csmcs ( see the section [ sec : smcs ] ) which are in agreement with the latest measurements of the precise electroweak ( ew ) data tests ( i.e. the @xmath20 and @xmath21 parameters ) and the signal strength , @xmath22 .",
    "we hope that this work will provide some insight to the physics of the high - energy qcd events in a realm , beyond the sm .",
    "the outlook of this paper is as follows : in the section [ sec : smcs ] we present a brief introduction to the general structure of the csmcs , including its scalar spectrum , its modifications and improvements over the sm .",
    "section [ sec : prod ] contains a comprehensive description over the utilities and the means for the calculation of the cross - section of the higgs bosons in hadron - hadron collisions , particularly targeting the events that take place at the lhc .",

    "<S> in the present work , we intend to predict the production rates of the higgs bosons in the simplest extension of the standard model ( sm ) by a neutral complex singlet ( csmcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> this model has an additional source of cp violation and provides strong enough first - order electroweak phase transition to generate the baryon asymmetry of universe ( bau ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar spectrum of the csmcs includes three neutral higgs particles with the lightest one considered to be the 125 gev higgs boson found at lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the sm - like higgs boson comes mostly from the sm - like su(2 ) doublet , with a small correction from the singlet . </S>",
    "<S> to predict the production rates of the higgs bosons , we use a conventional effective lo qcd framework and the unintegrated parton distribution functions ( updf ) of kimber - martin - ryskin ( kmr ) . </S>",
    "<S> we first compute the sm higgs production cross - section and compare the results to the existing theoretical calculations from different frameworks as well as the experimental data from the cms and atlas collaborations . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that our framework is capable of producing sound predictions for these high - energy qcd events in the sm . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards we present our predictions for the higgs boson production in the csmcs .    1 cm </S>"
