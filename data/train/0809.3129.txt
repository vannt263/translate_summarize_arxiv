    "understanding the critical properties of the qcd medium and its phase diagram is a central problem in strong interaction physics , which is being addressed in both theoretical and experimental studies .",

    "gluon plasma phase @xcite .",
    "effective models also provide a useful qualitative  description of the chiral phase transition @xcite . here , the expectation that the critical behavior of such models is governed by the same universality class as qcd @xcite is of central importance .",
    "furthermore , recent experimental data from heavy - ion collisions at rhic and sps provide new insight into the properties and behavior of a deconfined medium created in dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of a thermodynamic system may be mapped out by studying  fluctuations and their response to changes of the thermodynamic parameters . in qcd",
    "the fluctuations of conserved charges are particularly pertinent for exploring deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration @xcite .",
    "studies of qcd on the lattice at finite temperature and density show that  the ratio of the quartic to quadratic fluctuations of the net quark number @xmath1 ( kurtosis  . in this letter",

    ", we sacrifice rigor and refer to @xmath1 as kurtosis . ] ) is a valuable probe of deconfinement and chiral dynamics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , both model calculations @xcite and lgt studies @xcite indicate that the inverse compressibility @xmath3 is a useful observable for  identifying the position of the critical end point cep in the qcd phase diagram .    in the limits of high and low temperatures",
    ", @xmath1 depends on the net quark content of the relevant baryon number carrying degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "consequently , one expects a strong reduction of @xmath1 at the confinement - deconfinement transition .",
    "furthermore , the inverse compressibility @xmath3  vanishes at the cep , due to the divergence of the net quark number fluctuations at a critical point , belonging to the @xmath4 universality class @xcite .",
    "the first lgt studies of these observables , which were performed in 2-flavor qcd with a pion mass  of  @xmath5 mev @xcite , confirmed the expected behavior of @xmath1 above and below the deconfinement transition .",
    "however , the results for the inverse compressibility @xmath3 shows no sign of the expected decrease at the crossover temperature @xmath6 ; the lgt results for both @xmath1 and @xmath3 interpolate smoothly between the limiting values in the hadronic and quark gluon plasma phases .",
    "by contrast , results for @xmath1 and @xmath3   obtained recently in 2 + 1-flavor qcd with an almost physical pion mass , @xmath7 mev , exhibit a qualitatively different temperature dependence  @xcite . in these calculations ,",
    "the kurtosis was found to develop a peak whereas the inverse compressibility acquired a dip at the pseudocritical temperature .",
    "these results indicate that , close to the phase transition , these ratios depend on the strength of the explicit symmetry breaking term , i.e. on the value of the pion mass .     in this letter",
    ", we use universality arguments , relating qcd with chiral effective models , to explore the properties of the kurtosis and the inverse compressibility in hot and dense matter .",
    "we focus on the dependence of @xmath1  and @xmath3 on the pion mass near the chiral transition . as an effective model of qcd",
    "we use the quark - meson lagrangian coupled to the polyakov loop in the mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "we show , that the model results for @xmath1 and @xmath3 are consistent with the lgt results and find that the peak / dip structures are indeed strongly dependent on the value of the pion mass . given this ,",
    "we conclude that the non - monotonic behavior of these ratios found in lgt , for an almost physical pion mass , is due to the @xmath8 chiral dynamics of 2-flavor qcd .   since the explicit symmetry breaking in the strange sector is large",
    ", one expects the strange quarks to decouple from the critical fluctuations and consequently that the critical properties , for physical quark masses , are dominated by the up - down sector .",
    "this observation supports the notion that the scaling properties of 2 + 1-flavor qcd are also governed by the @xmath8 universality class .",
    "in order to explore the influence of chiral dynamics on  the above observables we use the effective lagrangian of quark - meson model coupled to the polyakov loop ( pqm model )  @xcite @xmath9 with  @xmath10 being an  effective potential of the gluon field expressed in terms of the traced polyakov loop @xmath11 and its conjugate @xmath12 . the @xmath8 representation of the meson fields is @xmath13 and the corresponding @xmath14 chiral  representation is given by @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , there are @xmath16 mesonic degrees of freedom coupled to @xmath17 flavors of constituent quarks @xmath18 .",
    "the effect of gluons are accounted for by introducing an effective field , which couples to the quarks by means of a covariant derivative @xmath19 here the spatial components of the gauge field are chosen such that their average vanish , i.e. @xmath20 .    in the mean field approximation the thermodynamics of the model is described  by the thermodynamic potential @xcite @xmath21 with the gluonic , mesonic and quark / antiquark contributions , respectively .",
    "the mesonic part of the potential is of the form @xmath22 where the last term describes the interaction of the scalar field @xmath23 with an external field @xmath24 .",
    "this term explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry of the lagrangian and gives the pion a finite mass @xmath25 .    the gluonic contribution to the thermodynamic potential",

    "furthermore , for the parameter @xmath37 we choose @xmath38 mev , the value favored in ref .",

    "3 ( \\ell^ * + \\ell    e^{-(e_p+\\mu)/t})e^{-(e_p+\\mu)/t}\\!\\!+\\!\\!e^{-3(e_p+\\mu)/t}\\right ] \\right\\},&&\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the quark chemical potential and @xmath41 is the  quasi - particle energy with @xmath42 being the constituent quark mass .    in the mean field approximation the three independent fields @xmath23",

    "in the following we focus on the quark sector of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "following the procedure in lgt studies @xcite , we use the taylor expansion in @xmath45 to compute various observables .",
    "in particular the thermodynamic pressure is expressed as @xmath46 with the expansion coefficients @xmath47 the taylor coefficients are generalized susceptibilities corresponding to moments of the net quark number @xcite .",
    "in particular , the first two non - vanishing derivatives ,  @xmath48 and  @xmath49 are the second and fourth order cumulants which are related to fluctuations   of net quark number , @xmath50 , as follows :    @xmath51    with @xmath52 being the quark number susceptibility .",
    "we focus on the  ratio @xmath53 which we define as the  kurtosis of the quark number fluctuations ( see footnote above ) .",
    "we consider the dimensionless ratio of the inverse compressibility and gibb s free energy density @xmath54 , @xmath55 where the inverse isothermal compressibility  of the system is given by @xmath56    before considering  @xmath1 and @xmath3  near the chiral phase transition ,  we first focus on their behavior well above and below the transition region . for high temperatures , i.e.  @xmath57 , the ratio @xmath58 and the polyakov loop @xmath59 .",
    "hence , the quark - antiquark contribution to the thermodynamic pressure ( [ eq : qqbar_pot ] ) converges to that of an ideal gas of quarks , where @xmath60.\\ ] ] thus , in the limit of high temperatures ,   @xmath1 and  @xmath3 are in both models given by @xmath61 where @xmath1 is evaluated at @xmath62 , while for @xmath3 we retain the @xmath40 dependence in anticipation of the application below .",
    "one of the main features of a chiral lagrangian coupled to the polyakov loop is the `` statistical confinement '' which implies , that at small @xmath63 , the effective degrees of freedom are three quark states @xcite .",
    "this is explicitly seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qqbar_pot ] ) , where  for small @xmath64 the polyakov loop  @xmath65 , implying suppression of the one- and two - quark states in the partition sum . consequently , in the boltzmann approximation .",
    "this condition is clearly satisfied for @xmath66 mev since @xmath67 mev . ]",
    "the fermion contribution to the pressure is @xmath68 thus , at low temperatures  the quark / antiquark contribution to the thermodynamic pressure is that of a non - interacting gas composed of  particles and  antiparticles  with   mass @xmath69 and baryon number @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the effective degeneracy of these particles is @xmath72 .",
    "the suppression by a factor @xmath73 is due to the rescaling of the momenta implied by the transformation @xmath74 .",
    "an important feature of the pressure  ( [ asp2 ] ) is the factorization of the @xmath75  and @xmath45 dependence , @xmath76 a similar factorization occurs in the hadron resonance gas model hrg , although with a more complicated function replacing @xmath77 . in the hrg ,",
    "the corresponding function involves a sum over all baryon states @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the polyakov - loop models fail to reproduce the pressure of a resonance gas , even when the hrg is restricted to a gas of nucleons and @xmath78 resonances ( more generally the lowest three - quark multiplets ) and their masses are approximated by @xmath79 .",
    "the origin of this failure is twofold : on the one hand the suppression factor mentioned above and , on the other hand , an incorrect dependence on @xmath80 .",
    "the latter is due to the fact that only states where all three quarks have the same flavor are counted in ( [ asp2 ] ) .",
    "since the hrg seems to provide a satisfactory description of the qcd equation of state at low temperatures  @xcite , the effective model considered here can , strictly speaking , be valid only near the phase transition , where the dynamics is controlled by the chiral symmetry .",
    "however , the model may  also be useful outside the critical region , for computing observables that are not sensitive to details of the mass spectrum .",
    "the kurtosis ( [ kar ] ) and the dimensionless inverse compressibility ( [ kapa ] ) fulfil this criterion at least at low temperatures . indeed , from eqs .",
    "( [ kar ] ) ,  ( [ kapa ] ) and ( [ asp ] ) it follows that the function @xmath77 , which depends on the mass spectrum , cancels in the ratios , leading to    @xmath81    for reference we also give the dimensionless inverse compressibility in the approximation , where @xmath82 and @xmath52 are computed to next - to - leading order in @xmath45 @xmath83    the kurtosis ( [ kar ] ) is strongly dependent on the  net quark content of the baryon number carrying effective degrees of freedom .",
    "for instance , at low temperatures , @xmath84 . consequently ,",
    "if the low - temperature phase is confining , @xmath70 and @xmath85 , as found also in the hadron resonance gas model  @xcite . on the other hand , in the pure quark - meson ( qm ) model ,",
    "i.e. neglecting the effects of the polyakov loop , the relevant fermionic degrees of freedom are single quarks , at all temperatures .",
    "therefore , the corresponding value of the kurtosis in the low temperature limit is @xmath86 .",
    "clearly , in an effective chiral model with quark degrees of freedom , the polyakov loop is essential for obtaining the correct low temperature behavior of the kurtosis  , although they do not yield a realistic description of the pressure at low temperatures , because the dependence on details of the baryon spectrum cancels in the ratio @xmath87 . ] .",
    "we now turn to the temperature dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath3 . by inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ a1 ] ) we conclude that both the kurtosis and @xmath3 are , for fixed @xmath45 , temperature independent far above and below the transition .",
    "however , the high- and low - temperature values differ considerably , implying that the two ratios must vary near the phase transition .",
    "the major contribution to the change of the kurtosis @xmath1 between the low and high temperature limits is due to the change of the relevant baryon number carrying degrees of freedom , from three - quark states to single quarks .",
    "thus , indeed the kurtosis is , as noted in @xcite , an excellent probe of deconfinement .",
    "it is clear from this discussion that , far above and below the transition , @xmath1 and @xmath3  are independent of @xmath0 .",
    "however , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio42_qm ] this is not the case in the phase transition region .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio42_qm ] we also show , that for @xmath88 the kurtosis in both the  pqm and qm models converges fairly rapidly to its  low - temperature limit , independently of the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the temperature ( in)dependence of @xmath1 in both models is consistent with lgt findings  in 2- and 2 + 1-flavor qcd @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed above , only the pqm model correctly reproduces the low @xmath63 limit , @xmath89 .         at high temperatures ,",
    "the kurtosis in the qm model reaches the asymptotic value already at @xmath90 , independently on the  value of the pion mass , in full agreement with lgt results @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the case for the pqm model , where even at @xmath91 , @xmath1 is still about @xmath92 above the ideal gas value .",
    "the different high - temperature behavior of the  pqm and qm models is clearly a consequence of the coupling of the quarks to the polyakov loop rather than an effect of the mean field dynamics , as conjectured in ref .",
    "the ideal gas value of @xmath1 is in the pqm model reached at high @xmath63 if both @xmath58 and @xmath93 .",
    "the first requirement is indeed satisfied already at @xmath94 , but the second is not valid even at @xmath91 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the parametrization of the polyakov loop effective potential in the pqm lagrangian ( [ eq : pqm_lagrangian ] ) .",
    "the parameters of the effective potential were fixed by fitting @xmath36 lattice results , where @xmath43 approaches its asymptotic value very slowly .",
    "this discussion points to a clear limitation of the applicability of the pqm model to the interpretation of lgt results  at high temperatures where e.g. , the interactions of quarks with space - like wilson loops , not included in the pqm model , could be relevant .    near the chiral transition",
    ",  the kurtosis  is strongly dependent on the pion mass . for a physical pion mass",
    ", @xmath1 exhibits a peak in both models .  with increasing @xmath0",
    "the peak height gradually decreases and its position is shifted to larger temperatures , reflecting an increase in @xmath6 .  the dependence of the kurtosis on the pion mass is stronger in the qm than in the pqm model . a comparison with  lgt results",
    "@xcite show that the pqm model yields a much better overall description of the lgt data . for large @xmath0",
    "there is a smooth change of the kurtosis between its limiting high- and low - temperature values , in agreement with 2-flavor qcd on the lattice @xcite . on the other hand ,  for physical @xmath0 , @xmath1 increases at @xmath6 beyond the low - temperature value @xmath95 .",
    "both these results , together with the low temperature limit , are consistent with the lgt results in 2 and 2 + 1 flavor qcd , obtained for @xmath5 and @xmath96 mev , respectively .",
    "the only problem of the pqm model in this context is the high - temperature behavior of @xmath1 , discussed above , while the qm model yields an incorrect low - temperature limit and a too strong dependence on the pion mass near the phase transition .",
    "consequently , we restrict our discussion below to the pqm model .    as a consequence of  @xmath8 scaling , one expects a strong variation of the kurtosis with @xmath0 near the chiral phase transition  @xcite . at @xmath62 , the singular part of the net quark number fluctuations scales as @xmath97 whereas that of the fourth order cumulant is of the form @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the critical exponent of the specific heat . in the @xmath8 universality class",
    ", @xmath100 is small and negative , @xmath101 .",
    "consequently , the regular part dominates in the susceptibility @xmath52 , whereas the singular part of @xmath49 corresponds to a cusp . in the presence of a term that explicitly breaks the @xmath8 symmetry ,",
    "the cusp is smoothened and can , for small pion masses , be seen in @xmath1 as a peak at @xmath6 . for larger @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath49 is dominated by the regular part , resulting in monotonic change of @xmath1 in the transition region .",
    "these expectations , which are borne out in the pqm model , are consistent with lgt results .    at finite chemical potential ,",
    "the singularity is stronger ; @xmath49 diverges at the @xmath8 line whereas the quark number susceptibility @xmath52 develops  a cusp .",
    "furthermore , @xmath52 diverges at the critical end point ( cep ) , in accordance with @xmath4 universality .",
    "consequently , the inverse compressibility ,  introduced in the  eq . ( [ kapa ] ) , is an interesting  observable that can be used to verify the existence of the cep , to identify its position , provided it exists and to establish the universality class of the chiral transition .    in left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_n_chi_qm_pqm_pion ] we show the temperature dependence of the dimensionless inverse compressibility @xmath3 ( [ kapa ] ) computed in the pqm model for fixed @xmath102 and for various values of  @xmath0 .",

    "@xmath3 is independent of @xmath0 and slowly converges  to the ideal gas value ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "similarly as in the case of  @xmath1 ,  @xmath3 deviates substantially from the  stefan - boltzmann result , due to the gentle approach of the polyakov loop to unity .    near the chiral transition , @xmath3  shows a rather  strong dependence on the pion mass . for large @xmath0",
    ", @xmath3  is smoothly increasing between the low- and  high - temperature values .",
    "on the other hand , for a physical value of the pion mass ( @xmath104 mev ) , a dip develops in the vicinity of @xmath6 . as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_n_chi_qm_pqm_pion ] , the value of @xmath3 at the dip drops with increasing @xmath45 .",
    "this is consistent with recent lattice results  @xcite obtained in 2 + 1 flavor qcd for @xmath105 mev .",
    "the agreement of the two - flavor pqm model results with those of 2 + 1 flavor lgt suggests that the lattice results reflect the critical behavior of @xmath8 chiral dynamics .    for the parameters used in our calculations",
    ", the cep appears in the pqm model at @xmath106 .",
    "consequently , at this value of @xmath45 , @xmath3 should vanish at the critical temperature .",
    "it is clear from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_n_chi_qm_pqm_pion ] that @xmath3 clearly reflects the @xmath8 critical dynamics .",

    "although the value of  @xmath3 at @xmath6 drops with increasing @xmath45 , as the cep is approached , it remains different from zero .",
    "this is clearly a consequence of the taylor expansion , since the zero of @xmath3 is due to the singularity   of the quark number susceptibility , which is not reproduced by a polynomial of finite order .",
