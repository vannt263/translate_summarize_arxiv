    "however , the @xmath163 and @xmath164 were first estimated by barker  @xcite by looking at the ratio of the @xmath165 s for the @xmath107 doublet and comparing to shell - model calculations . instead",
    ", we could use our more sophisticated calculations to determine the best isospin - mixing parameters .",
    "if we minimize the @xmath166 with respect to experiment for the four spatial symmetry - conserving transitions , i.e. , those given in the third block of table  [ tab : m1 ] , we find @xmath163 = 0.31(4 ) , compared to the  experimental \" value of 0.21(3 ) used above in table  [ tab : m1 ] and discussed in ref .",
    "the predicted widths for these two isospin - mixing parameters are compared in table  [ tab : imix ] , along with the four other symmetry - changing transitions from the @xmath107 doublet to the ground or first excited state ; the @xmath166 comparison with experiment for these cases is also improved . however , this alternate value for @xmath163 implies a significantly larger i m matrix element @xmath167 kev , compared to the theoretical value for this hamiltonian of @xmath168 kev calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was in good agreement with the earlier empirical value of @xmath169 kev .",
    "the results of our qmc calculations are in fair agreement with experiment when the transitions are between states of the same spatial symmetry . however , when the spatial symmetry of the initial and final states is different , we generally underpredict the reported experimental widths .",
    "the @xmath3 calculations of table  [ tab : e2 ] give large matrix elements for the @xmath170\\rightarrow[44]$ ] transitions and show reasonable agreement with the recently remeasured @xmath153 width .",
    "the calculations underpredict the @xmath170\\rightarrow[431]$ ] transitions from the isospin - mixed @xmath96 doublet to the ground state , although here both theory and experiment have large error bars .",
    "the predicted transitions to the first @xmath96 are smaller , and perhaps not surprisingly unobserved to date . for the @xmath3 transition from the first @xmath107 at 17.64 mev , we significantly overpredict the width , due to a surprisingly large @xmath171 matrix element between @xmath172 $ ] and @xmath173 $ ] symmetry components .",
    "the unobserved transition from the @xmath107 state at 18.15 mev is tiny , due to a vanishing @xmath174 matrix element .",
    "the larger value of @xmath163 discussed above would reduce the discrepancy with experiment slightly .",
    "the qmc results for @xmath2 matrix elements are similar , in that the four symmetry - conserving @xmath175\\rightarrow[431]$ ] transitions are in fair agreement with experiment , once mec contributions are included .",
    "the agreement can be improved further by searching for better isospin - mixing parameters , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , as discussed above .",
    "seven of the eight symmetry - changing @xmath2 transitions are underpredicted by amounts ranging from only 25% to factors of 25 .",
    "the worst matrix element is the same @xmath176 transition that also vanishes in @xmath3 , leading to a decay width for the 18.15 mev state which is 1530 times too small .    even though many of the experimental widths considered in this work have large errors , the serious discrepancies between some of the experimental and calculated values highlight the challenge for theory to accurately predict transition amplitudes between states with dominant admixtures of different spatial symmetry or between states consisting of linear combinations of components of different spatial symmetry and occurring with similar probabilities .    to our knowledge , refs .",
    "@xcite and the present work are the only _ ab initio _ calculations of em transitions in @xmath177 nuclei that include mec contributions .",
    "we find that the calculated @xmath2 matrix elements have significant contributions , typically at the 20 - 30% level , from two - body em current operators , especially from those of one - pion range .",
    "the sizable mec corrections are found to almost always improve the ia results for @xmath2 transitions .",
    "this corroborates the importance of many - body effects in nuclear systems , and indicates that an understanding of low - energy em transitions requires contributions from mec in combination with a complete treatment of nuclear dynamics based on hamiltonians that include two- and three - nucleon forces .",
