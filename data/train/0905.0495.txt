    "the rapidly variable , aperiodic x - ray continuum emission from seyfert agn has long supported the notion that the x - ray emission originates from within a few tens of schwarzschild radii of the central supermassive black hole . in the late 1980 s , _ exosat _ probed x - ray variability on time scales of a few days or less , yielding power spectral density functions ( psds ) covering temporal frequencies down to @xmath6 hz .",
    "these psds established the scale - invariant `` red - noise '' nature , i.e. , larger variability amplitudes toward larger time scales , characterized by a psd which increases toward lower temporal frequencies .",
    "however , no characteristic time scale , such as a `` break '' in the psd power - law slope , was detected ( e.g. , lawrence et al .",
    "1987 ; mchardy & czerny 1987 ; green , mchardy & lehto 1993 ) .",
    "the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) was launched in 1995 ; its unique attributes ( large effective area , high throughput , fast slewing , and flexible scheduling ) permitted multi - time scale monitoring campaigns that probed x - ray variability on time scales from hours to years ( temporal frequencies from @xmath7 hz ) .",
    "the resulting seyfert broadband psds yielded evidence for breaks at temporal frequencies @xmath8 with psd power - law slopes breaking from @xmath92 to @xmath91 above and below @xmath8 , respectively ; the break frequencies corresponded to break time scales @xmath1 of a few days or less ( e.g. , edelson & nandra 1999 ; pounds et al .",

    "it was noted by m03 that a small sample of seyfert psds was consistent with a relation between @xmath1 and black hole mass @xmath3 estimated via reverberation mapping , in the sense that relatively larger - mass black holes are associated with psds with larger values of @xmath1 , albeit with some scatter . using a larger sample , mchardy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) demonstrated that the scatter could be explained by an additional dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath10 , the accretion rate relative to eddington , in that for a given @xmath3 , sources accreting at relatively higher rates have psds shifted toward higher @xmath8 ( smaller values of @xmath1 ) . in the absence of an accurate estimate of @xmath3 by other means , x - ray timing can thus be used to estimate @xmath3 , if @xmath1 and bolometric luminosity @xmath11 are both known .    in this paper , we present the broadband 310 kev psd of ic 4329a , an x - ray bright and variable seyfert located at a redshift of @xmath12 = 0.01605 ( willmer et al .",
    "ic 4329a had been monitored in the optical with the intent of using reverberation mapping to estimate @xmath3 in this object , but the constraints were quite poor ( winge et al .  1996 ; peterson et al .",

    "we also present psds for the 35 , 510 , 1020 , and 2040 kev bands .",
    "section 2 reviews the multi - time scale sampling strategy and describes the observations , data reduction , and light curve sampling .",
    "section 3 describes the methods of measurement and modeling of the psds .",
    "the results of model fits to the psds are presented in @xmath134 . in @xmath135 , the psd break frequency is used to yield an estimate of @xmath3 based on x - ray timing , which we compare to estimates obtained by various other methods .",
    "we followed the observing strategy of edelson and nandra ( 1999 ) , u02 , m03 , etc . , in which a source is monitored with",
    "even , regular sampling on multiple time scales such that the resulting set of light curves yields individual psds covering complementary temporal frequency ranges . with the reasonable assumption",
    "that the underlying psd shape has remained constant throughout all the monitoring observations and/or x - ray luminosity , we expect significant changes in the shapes of agn psds only on timescales of centuries to millennia . ] , the individual psds are combined to produce the final broadband psd .",

    "the background was estimated using the `` l7 - 240 '' background models , appropriate for faint sources ; see e.g. , markowitz , edelson & vaughan ( 2003a ) and edelson & nandra ( 1999 ) for details on pca background subtraction , the dominant source of systematic uncertainty ( e.g. , in total broadband count rate ) in these data .",
    "spectral fitting for each observation was done using xspec version 11.3.2ag , assuming a galactic column of @xmath19 @xmath20 ( kalberla et al .",
    "as the response of the pca slowly hardens slightly over time due to the gradual leak of xenon gas into the propane layer in each pcu , response files were generated for each separate observation .",
    "fluxed light curves were extracted in the 310 kev band by fitting a power - law to that band only ( 210 kev is a `` standard '' hard x - ray measurement band , but the 23 kev effective area of the pca is extremely small , so we use 310 kev here ) .",
    "light curves for the 35 and 510 kev sub - bands and the 1020 kev band were also extracted .",
    "errors on each light curve point were derived from the standard error of 16-s count rate light curve bins within each observation .",

    "it is plotted in figure 1 .",
    "light curves for the 35 and 510 kev sub - bands were also extracted , binned to 5000 s ( 27 points ) .",
    "light curve sampling parameters , including mean net source and background count rates , for all light curves are listed in table 1 .",
    "also listed in table 1 are variability amplitudes @xmath34 ( see vaughan et al .",
    "2003 for definition of @xmath34 and its uncertainty ) for all light curves .",
    "previous works have noted that , from 2 to @xmath920 kev , @xmath34 is generally observed to decrease with increasing photon energy ( e.g. , markowitz , edelson & vaughan 2003a ; miniutti et al .",
    "2007 ) ; possible explanations include the dilution of the observed variability of the coronal power - law component by the compton reflection hump or `` pivoting '' of the power - law component .",
    "the values of @xmath34 for the 35 , 510 , and 1020 kev bands are consistent with this trend ( in the case of the 2040 kev light curve , it is not immediately obvious how much variability is intrinsic and how much is due to the systematic effects discussed in @xmath132 ) .",

    "nonetheless , the 2040 kev psd presented here is , to our knowledge , the first x - ray psd of a seyfert above 20 kev .",
    "psds were measured for each light curve separately , as described in @xmath133.1 .",
    "however , as described in @xmath133.2 , these `` observed '' psds suffer from measurement distortion effects ( aliasing and red - noise leak ) and the errors are not well - determined .",
    "a model - dependent monte carlo method was used to assign proper errors and to recover the intrinsic , underlying psd shape .",

    "initial psd construction closely followed @xmath133.1 of m03 .",
    "light curves were linearly interpolated across gaps , though such gaps were rare .",
    "each light curve s mean was subtracted .",
    "periodograms were constructed using a discrete fourier transform ( e.g. , oppenheim & shafer 1975 ; see also @xmath133.1 of m03 for definitions of fourier frequencies @xmath35 and the periodogram ) .",
    "following papadakis & lawrence ( 1993 ) and vaughan ( 2005 ) , the periodogram was logarithmically binned every factor of 1.6 in @xmath35 ( 0.20 in the logarithm ) to produce the observed psd @xmath36 ; the two lowest temporal frequency bins were widened to accommodate three periodogram points .",
    "the @xmath95 lowest - temporal frequency bins in each individual psd typically contained @xmath3715 periodogram points , precluding us from assigning normal errors .    the individual long- , medium- , and short - term psds were combined to yield the final , broadband observed psds @xmath36 , which are plotted in figure 2 , as well as in the top panels of figures 3 , 4 , and 5 in @xmath38 space .",
    "no renormalization of the individual psds was done .",
    "the constant level of power due to poisson noise was not subtracted from these psds , but instead modeled in the monte carlo analysis below .",
    "visual inspection of figure 2 supports , at first glance , the notion that all five psds are at least roughly consistent in broadband shape .",
    "however , to account for psd measurement effects ( the reader is referred to u02 and m03 for descriptions of aliasing and red - noise leak , and how the method accounts for them ) and to assign proper errors , we use a version of the monte carlo technique `` psresp '' introduced by u02 .",
    "we summarize this technique as follows : one first assumes an underlying broadband model psd shape , and , for each individual observed light curve sampling pattern , one uses the algorithm of timmer & knig ( 1995 ) to generate @xmath39 light curves .",
    "the simulated light curves are each resampled to match the observed light curve , then psds are calculated .",
    "the model average psd @xmath40 , which accounts for the distortion effects , is calculated from the @xmath39 psds ; errors for each psd bin are assigned based on the rms spread of the individual simulated psds at a given temporal frequency bin .",
    "the constant level of power due to poisson noise @xmath41 ( see table 2 ) is added to the model as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the source and background count rates , respectively ; for non - continuously sampled light curves , this must be multiplied by the ratio of @xmath45 , the average sampling time , to the average exposure time per observation . for the hexte light curves , the estimates of @xmath41",
    "were calculated taking into consideration the total number of good detectors ( e.g. , times when cluster a data were not used ) .",
    "the goodness of fit is determined .",
    "a statistic @xmath46 which compares the observed psd @xmath36 to the model average psd @xmath40 , using the errors from the model ( as opposed to using poorly - determined errors from the observed psd ) , is calculated .",
    "the best - fitting normalization of the @xmath47 is found by renormalizing @xmath40 until the value of observed @xmath46 is minimized .",
    "10,000 combinations of the long- , medium- , and short - term psds @xmath47 are randomly selected to model the @xmath46 distribution , comparing @xmath47 to @xmath40 .",
    "the probability that the model psd can be rejected , @xmath48 , is defined as the percentile of the 10,000 simulated @xmath46 values exceeded by the value of the observed @xmath46 .    a range of underlying psd model shapes is thus tested in this way , and the model with the lowest rejection probability ( highest likelihood of acceptance @xmath49 ) can be identified .",
    "we tested psd model shapes consisting of simple unbroken power - law models and singly - broken power - law models ; the quality of each psd precludes more complex shapes such as single or multiple lorentzian components or quasi - periodic oscillations routinely modeled in the psds of x - ray binary systems .",
    "the unbroken power - law model was of the form @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the power - law slope and the normalization @xmath52 is the psd amplitude at @xmath53 , arbitrary chosen to be @xmath54 hz .",
    "@xmath41 is added to each simulated psd but is not explicitly listed here since @xmath41 is different for each psd segment .",

    "the errors on @xmath51 correspond to values 1@xmath56 above the rejection probability @xmath57 for the best - fit value on a gaussian probability distribution ; for example , if the best - fit model had @xmath57=95.45@xmath21 ( 2.0@xmath56 on a gaussian probability distribution ) , errors correspond to @xmath57=99.73@xmath21 ( 3.0@xmath56 ) .",
    "the errors on @xmath52 were determined from the rms spread of the @xmath58 randomly selected sets of simulated psds .",
    "the high rejection probabilities for the 310 , 35 , and 510 kev psds ( each @xmath18 90@xmath21 ) and the residuals plotted in figures 3b and 4b suggest that a more complex psd model shape may be appropriate for these three psds .",
    "the 1020 kev and 2040 kev psds cover less dynamic range in temporal frequency than their @xmath3710 kev counterparts due to the lack of short - term sampling ; the rejection probabilities are consequently much lower , @xmath3790@xmath21 , along with smaller residuals ( figure 5b ) .",
    "to test for the presence of breaks in the psd , we then tested a singly - broken psd model shape of the form    @xmath59 where the normalization @xmath60 is the psd amplitude at the break frequency @xmath8 , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the low- and high - frequency power law slopes , respectively , with the constraint @xmath63 .",
    "( we also tested a more slowly - bending psd model of the form @xmath64 , but given the psd quality , there were degeneracies between @xmath8 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 such that reasonable constraints on @xmath8 could not be attained . )",
    "the range of slopes tested was 0.03.2 in increments of 0.1 .",
    "break frequencies were tested in the log from 7.4 to 4.9 in increments of 0.1 , corresponding to @xmath65 in the linear scale .",

    "the best - fit model parameters , along with likelihoods of acceptance @xmath66 , are listed in table 4 ; residuals are plotted in the bottom panels of figures 3 and 4 for the 310 , 35 , and 510 kev psds .",
    "figure 6 shows contour plots of @xmath62 versus @xmath8 for these three psds at the respective best - fit values of @xmath61 .",
    "we use the ratio of the likelihoods of acceptance @xmath67 between the broken and unbroken power law model fits to establish if a break is significant ( we use @xmath67 at least @xmath9 10 ) . for the 310 kev psd ,",
    "we conclude that a break is significantly detected at @xmath68 hz = @xmath69 hz , which corresponds to a time scale of @xmath2 days .",
    "breaks are also significantly detected in each 35 and 510 kev sub - band psd , with best values of @xmath8 also near @xmath54 hz . because of the limited dynamic range in temporal frequency for the 1020 and 2040 kev psds , the improvement in fit when adding a break to the model is not high , with @xmath70 .",
    "parameters for the broken power - law model are thus listed in parentheses in table 4 for these two psds and data / model residuals are not plotted .",
    "we next explored the possibility that all five psds could be consistent with the same psd shape , namely that of the 310 kev psd , with a low - frequency power law slope equal to 1.0 , a high frequency slope near 2 , and a break frequency @xmath71 hz . we re - tested the 35 and 510 kev psds with a broken power - law model , keeping @xmath61 fixed at 1.0 .",

    "we conclude that the 1020 and 2040 kev psds are at least roughly consistent with the presence of breaks at or near that found in the @xmath3710 kev psds , and with the same @xmath61 , and that the @xmath1810 kev psds probe temporal frequencies primarily below the break frequency .",
    "we have used complementary _ rxte _ and _ xmm - newton _ monitoring of the x - ray bright seyfert agn ic 4329a to measure the 310 kev psd , and we find significant evidence for a break in the modeled power - law slope at a temporal frequency of @xmath0 hz , which corresponds to a break time scale @xmath1 of @xmath2 days .",

    "using the average of these two values yields @xmath118 . finally , nikolajuk , papadakis & czerny ( 2004 ) suggested a prescription to estimate @xmath3 based on short - term ( @xmath119 day duration ) x - ray variability amplitude measurements , provided that the variability amplitude measured probes temporal frequencies above the psd break and that the psd power law slope at high temporal frequencies is 2 ; this assumption is consistent with the current psd results .",

    "however , it is not immediately obvious from the shape of ic 4329a s psd and from the derived value of @xmath10 if ic 4329a is an analog to a high / soft or low / hard state black hole x - ray binary system .",
    "there is not enough temporal frequency coverage below the break in the psd of ic 4329a to determine if the power - law slope of @xmath91 persists for several decades of temporal frequency below the break , which would identify it as an analog of cyg x-1 in the high / soft state ( e.g. , axelsson , borgonovo & larsson 2005 ) ; monitoring covering temporal frequencies down to and below @xmath122 hz would be needed to determine the ultra - low temporal frequency psd shape of ic 4329a .",
    "the psds presented here are roughly consistent with same underlying broadband psd shape at all energies probed : a break near @xmath123 hz , and power - law slopes of @xmath124 and @xmath125 below and above the break frequency , respectively .",
    "the 1020 and 2040 kev psds are probing temporal frequencies primarily below the break frequency but are consistent with the presence of a break in the psd up to 2040 kev .",
    "arvalo & uttley ( 2006 ) noted that an increase in @xmath8 with photon energy is expected in a model incorporating inwardly propagating variations in the local mass accretion rate modifying the central x - ray emission ( lyubarskii 1997 , kotov et al .",
    "2001 ) , with relatively harder x - ray bands associated with more centrally concentrated emissivity profiles .",
    "however , no significant breaks were detected in the 1020 and 2040 kev psds .",
    "the current 35 and 510 kev psds lack the necessary high temporal frequency resolution to discern any dependence of @xmath8 on photon energy . a much more dense temporal frequency sampling covering at least the range @xmath126 hz would be required to adequately test any energy dependence of @xmath8 in this object .",
