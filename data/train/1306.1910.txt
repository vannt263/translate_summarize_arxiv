    "the @xmath1cdm model has successfully explained many important cosmological observations such as the acceleration of the universe and the radial velocity distribution of the galaxies as well as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "besides the motivation of the theoretical completeness , from the viewpoint of the observational data there still leaves some room for the existence of physics beyond @xmath1cdm .",
    "recently , the analysis of the pure cmb data shows that the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom is @xmath2 ( 95% cl )  @xcite , which accommodates the standard model ( sm ) prediction of @xmath3  @xcite within @xmath4 range , while the combined analysis with the measurement of @xmath5 gives @xmath6 ( 95% cl )  @xcite , which is larger than the sm value at around @xmath7 level .",
    "the extra degree of freedom is usually referred to as dark radiation ( dr ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the extra radiating component can be extracted by the probe of the primordial deuterium and helium abundances at the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) epoch  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it has been recently shown that @xmath8 and @xmath9 in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "many models have been used to describe @xmath10 . among them , imposing a new relativistic degree of freedom beyond the sm is a straightforward way  @xcite , but such a scenario can only explain the case in which dr is in an equal amount at the bbn and cmb epoches , namely , @xmath11 .",
    "note that there may be a tension between bbn and cmb for @xmath12 as the current data seems to indicate that @xmath13 . in order to understand such a decrease ( or increase ) of @xmath12 at cmb",
    ", various subtle models have been proposed in which some interactions between dr and dark matter ( dm ) are assumed .",
    "for example , if heavy dm particles can decay into relativistic states , the increase in dr could be interpreted ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for model dependent and independent analyses .",
    "since there is no evidence that the dark sectors are independent to each other , an interaction between dm and dr is quite possible .",
    "models related to this possibility have been widely discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that there are still some drawbacks in these models : some of them blow up @xmath0 in the late time , which is also equivalent to the existence of non - vanishing interaction between dm and dr in the present . in this paper , we propose a unified dark fluid model describing both dm and dr , which can nicely yield the decrease ( or increase ) in @xmath14 without the above drawbacks .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we introduce the unified dark fluid model . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we discuss the extra effective relativistic degree of freedom @xmath0 .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "we start with a dark fluid , in which the energy density is expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the scale factor of the universe , @xmath17 is a small real number , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are positive , which can be determined by the initial condition at some specific time . note that this dark fluid can be viewed as a mixture of dm and dr .",
    "in fact , it is a special case of the new generalized chaplygin gas ( ngcg ) model with the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath20 proposed in ref .",
    "we remark that this model is also inspired by the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) scenario which unifies dm and dark energy ( in the case of the cosmological constant ) in a single fluid  @xcite . for @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ cteq ] ) , the energy density reduces to the sum of matter and radiation forms . for @xmath17 being a small real number , the fluid can exhibit the behavior of both matter and radiation .    from the continuity equation , @xmath22 ,",
    "the pressure of the dark fluid @xmath23 can be derived , and then the eos parameter of the dark fluid can be obtained to be @xmath24 for a small @xmath16 , we have @xmath25 , which is the same as the radiation fluid , while for a large @xmath16 , the fluid behaves like matter with @xmath26 .",
    "similar to gcg , this fluid can be naturally decomposed into two interacting components with constant eos parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath27 , respectively . as a result",
    ", this unified dark fluid model can also be regarded as an interacting dark - sector model in which dm interacts with dr .",
    "subsequently , we can write @xmath28 and @xmath29 . by using @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we derive @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "evidently , @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be naturally determined by the initial condition of the two components , e.g. , the dr and dm densities at the present time .",
    "the energy transfer from dm to dr in unit volume and in unit time can be derived as @xmath34 where the sign of @xmath17 fixes the direction of the energy flow .",
    "a positive @xmath17 makes the energy flow from dr to dm , whereas the negative one reverses the direction . by this definition ,",
    "the energy continuity equations for dm and dr are given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "note that if @xmath37 , the energy transfer @xmath38 can be reduced to @xmath39 .",
    "this kind of the interaction simultaneously involves the two important forms @xmath40 and @xmath41 , studied extensively in the interacting dark energy models  @xcite .",
    "these forms , similar to those obtained from the gcg fluid , are crucial features of the gcg - like model  @xcite .",
    "we remark that once @xmath38 is proportional to the hubble expansion rate @xmath42 , there is a factor of @xmath43 in the radiation dominated epoch .",
    "we will discuss the effect of the interactions on the time evolution of @xmath0 in the next section .",
    "it should be pointed out that although our model is inspired by the gcg and ngcg models , there are some significant differences between the dm - dr interacting model and the dm - dark energy interacting model , in particular when the cosmological perturbations are considered . for example , for the gcg model , when it is considered as a unified model",
    "the perturbation calculations force it to be extremely close to the @xmath1cdm model ( @xmath44 )  @xcite , whereas a much wider range of @xmath17 is allowed , i.e. , @xmath17 may be of the order @xmath45",
    "@xcite , when it is treated as a model of vacuum energy interacting with dm .",
    "the case of the ngcg model is discussed in ref .",
    "the primary cause is that dark energy is a non - adiabatic fluid so that how to treat its pressure perturbation is obscure to some extent .",
    "is negative , its adiabatic sound speed @xmath46 would be imaginary due to @xmath47 ( for the example of constant @xmath48 ) , leading to instability in the theory . in order to fix this problem ,",
    "it is necessary to assume that dark energy is a non - adiabatic fluid and impose a physical sound speed @xmath49 by hand .",
    "usually , @xmath50 is set to be the light speed as if the dark energy fluid is realized by a scalar field , which is what is done in the camb and cmbfast codes .",
    "but such a treatment would also lead to some instabilities , in particular for the @xmath51-crossing models and some specific interacting dark energy models . for more detailed discussions , see ref .  @xcite . ] nevertheless , for the model considered in this paper , since both dm and dr are adiabatic fluids , our model can be treated as a model of unified dark fluid as well as a model of dm interacting with dr . as a result , we expect that the constraints on our model from `` geometry measurements '' and `` structure s growth measurements '' will be consistent owing to the fact that both dm and dr are adiabatic fluids with well defined sound speeds and well treated pressure perturbations .",
    "from the definition of @xmath52 , the extra relativistic energy density exceeding the @xmath1cdm model is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 after the photon was heated at the @xmath55 annihilation epoch .",
    "on terms of the description of our model , dr interacts with dm , which results in the deviation @xmath56 from the standard evolution behavior in the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "consequently , if we identify @xmath57 with @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ rhonu ] ) , we obtain a time evolutionary @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "since dm also differs from the standard scaling @xmath58 , we can write @xmath59 , where @xmath60 represents the departure from the standard result . the explicit form of @xmath60 can be extracted from eq .",
    "( [ eqdensitycom ] ) . hence , according to the decomposition of the model , we have @xmath61 where @xmath62 has been re - parameterized by the value @xmath63 at the present time and a dimensionless parameter @xmath64 , taken around @xmath65 , which is of the same order as the radiation fractional density now .    in fig .",

    "all curves with @xmath64 fixed approach the same @xmath0 at @xmath72 , which are sensitive to the initial condition @xmath63 for @xmath73 . for @xmath66 , @xmath0 is a decreasing function , while for @xmath74 or @xmath75 , it behaves as an increasing one .",
