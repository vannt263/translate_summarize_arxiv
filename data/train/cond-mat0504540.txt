    "dynamics of nonequilibrium electrons and phonons in metals , semiconductors , and superconductors have been the focus of much attention because of their fundamental interest in solid - state physics . in particular ,",
    "electron - phonon interaction is the center of the interest for understanding the nature of nonequilibrium electron relaxation [ electron - phonon ( @xmath2 ) thermalization ] , of dressed electrons ( an electron plus its phonon cloud ) , of phonon self - energy ( real part corresponds to the change in phonon frequency ) , and of phonon - induced electron - electron interaction ( this effect gives the birth of the cooper pair in superconductors).@xcite    in metals , relaxation dynamics of optically excited nonequilibrium electrons has been extensively studied by transient - reflectivity ( tr ) or transient- transmission ( tt ) pump - probe techniques using femtosecond lasers.@xcite the @xmath2 thermalization occurs on a subpicosecond time scale in metals and has been traditionally described by the use of the two temperature model ( ttm).@xcite besides the observation of the dynamics of nonequilibrium electrons , coherent acoustic phonon pulses have been investigated by using the pump - probe angular deflection technique.@xcite the acoustic phonon pulse is generated through transient heating of the sample surface induced by excitation with intense laser pulses .",
    "the response from acoustic phonon pulses is typically observed on a several hundred picosecond time scale ( or gigahertz frequency range ) @xcite . since the electron - phonon thermalization that we are considering takes place on a subpicosecond time scale ( or terahertz frequency range),@xcite coherent optical phonons in metals , which are impulsively excited and decay within a few picoseconds , may play an important role in relaxation of hot electrons .",
    "recently , melnikov _ et al .",
    "_ have observed the surface coherent optical phonon ( @xmath3 = 2.9 thz ) at the surface of gd metal using the second harmonic generation ( shg ) technique.@xcite they focused their attention into the generation mechanism of the coherent optical phonon and coupled coherent magnon .",
    "the surface coherent optical phonon was excited by a transient charge separation at the surface , which is similar proposal to the displacive excitation mechanism ( decp).@xcite furthermore , bovensiepen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied both surface and bulk coherent optical phonons in gd metal using the shg and tr techniques , respectively .",
    "they discussed the transient frequency shifts observed for the both phonons .",
    "et al . _ revealed coherent surface vibration on cs / pt(111 ) system by using the shg technique.@xcite the coherent stretching vibration ( @xmath3 = 2.2 thz ) was generated by resonant impulsive stimulated raman scattering ( isrs),@xcite and the damping of the coherent surface vibration was dominated by pure dephasing caused by hot electrons at absorbate .",
    "thus , the shg technique has mainly enabled studying surface coherent optical phonons on metallic surfaces .",
    "nevertheless , investigations of bulk coherent optical phonons in metals using conventional tr or tt pump - probe techniques are still few mainly because of the very short optical penetration depth in metals stemming from the absorption by free electrons ( drude absorption ) .",
    "therefore the change in the refractive index associated with the coherent phonon oscillations are very weak in the bulk , making it very difficult to measure .",
    "although study of the surface coherent optical phonon in metal surfaces offers interesting applications , e.g. , controlling chemical reactions on metal surfaces , there is also tremendous motivation to observe and control the bulk coherent optical phonon in metals in order to study transient melting as a precursor of phase transition@xcite , as well as controlling electron - phonon scattering.@xcite    in absorbing media , e.g. , in semimetals , resonant isrs has been proposed as the main generation mechanism of the coherent a@xmath4 phonon.@xcite stevens _ et al . _",
    "considered both the standard raman susceptibility and the electrostrictive tensor as the driving force for resonant isrs.@xcite since electrostrictive force is proportional to the dielectric function , the amplitude of the coherent phonon depends on the incident photon energy.@xcite in some metals , interband transition occurs in the near infrared region , which appears as a peak in the imaginary part of the dielectric function , and the interband transition could enhance the amplitude of the coherent phonons through the resonant isrs process .",
    "therefore the realization of generation and observation of bulk coherent optical phonons in metals using the tr pump - probe technique requires ( i ) existence of @xmath5 = 0 optical phonon , which can be observed by raman scattering and ( ii ) a spectral peak in the imaginary part of the dielectric function , which is related to interband transition .",
    "appropriate candidates of the metallic samples that meet the above requirements , are zn , cd , and mg , in which @xmath5 = 0 optical phonon modes were , in fact , observed in raman scattering.@xcite    in this paper , we report on the observation of both bulk coherent optical phonon and nonequilibrium electrons in zn and cd using a femtosecond pump - probe reflectivity technique with high sensitivity of @xmath6 = 10@xmath7 .",
    "the coherent @xmath0 phonon , whose oscillatory frequency is in the terahertz region , is generated by optical excitation of nonequilibrium electrons ( interband transition ) .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations decreases dramatically as the temperature is raised from 7 k to room temperature .",
    "importantly , the temperature dependence of the amplitude of oscillation closely follows the temperature dependence of the subpicosecond electronic transient , suggesting that under the resonant condition both electronic and phononic responses are proportional to the change in the dielectric function .",
    "the relaxation time of the fast electronic response decreases with decreasing temperature , showing saturation at temperatures below 100 k. in fact , this behavior closely follows the temperature dependence of the electron - phonon thermalization time observed in simple metals , such as au , ag @xcite . in order to explain the peculiar temperature dependence of the amplitude of the electronic transient , we have derived a simple model , where the photoinduced change in reflectivity is governed by photoinduced absorption , where the initial states lie near the fermi energy . assuming the so - called two - temperature model @xcite and energy conservation law we were able to reproduce the temperature dependence of the transient amplitude extremely well - further supporting the association of a fast transient with electron - phonon thermalization and correlation between electronic and phononic responses via the dielectric function .",

    "the pump - beam power was varied from 20 to 120 mw , while the probe - beam power was fixed at 5 mw .",
    "the polarizations of the pump and probe beams are orthogonal to each other to avoid picking the scattered pump beam on the detector .",
    "we used a lock - in detection where the pump - beam was mechanically chopped at 2 khz .",

    "therefore the contribution to the signal from the surface oxide layer is negligibly small . at the pump fluence of 9.2@xmath10j/@xmath8 ( 60 mw ) we estimated the maximum electron temperature rise @xmath14 ( assuming a thermalized electron gas ) to be @xmath15 100 k at 7 k.@xcite",

    "one is the initial transient nonoscillatory response because of excitation and relaxation of nonequilibrium electrons ( fast electronic response ) , which decays in a few hundred femtoseconds . since the interband electronic transition near the l - point occurs at around 800 nm ( 1.55 ev),@xcite this interband transition dominates generation of nonequilibrium electron distribution in zn .",
    "the second component is the oscillatory signal due to generation of the coherent lattice vibration ( coherent phonon response ) .",
    "the time period of the observed coherent oscillation is several hundred femtoseconds , corresponding to the bulk @xmath0 optical phonon mode as discussed below .",
    "it is to be noted that in addition to zn and cd samples , we tried to measure coherent optical phonons also in alkaline - earth metal mg ( 0001 ) , however we observed only very weak electronic response and no oscillations in the tr signal ( not shown ) .",
    "the amplitude of the coherent optical phonon is significantly larger in zn than that in cd .",

    "the cosine phase is consistent with the prediction from stevens model [ see eq .",

    "further argument for the displacive nature of the observed transient is the strong correlation between the photoinduced quasiparticle density and the amplitude of the coherent optical phonon observed in both temperature and fluence dependences .",

    "5 we use the same fitting function as used for describing the temperature dependence of the electric transient .",

    "iii , the driving force @xmath117 is the heaviside function convoluted with gaussian and causes displacive behavior for the excitation of raman active mode through resonant isrs process . because im(@xmath38 ) is directly related to photo excitation of nonequilibrium electrons , quasiparticle density should follow im(@xmath38 ) : n@xmath118",

    "we have investigated ultrafast dynamics of coherent optical phonons and nonequilibrium electrons in transition metal zn and cd using a femtosecond pump - probe technique . the optical response in time domain is well fitted by linear combination of a damped harmonic oscillation due to excitation of coherent @xmath0 phonon and a subpicosecond electronic transient .",
    "dynamics of both the nonequilibrium electron distribution and the photoexcited coherent @xmath0 phonon were observed in a wide temperature range from 7 to 295 k. the amplitudes of both the coherent optical phonon and electronic transient show pronounced temperature dependencies . based on the fact that the relaxation time of the fast electronic transient closely follows the prediction of the thermomodulation scenario we analyze the relaxation dynamics in terms of the two - temperature model .",
    "good agreement with the model is obtained between 50 k and room temperature , while below 50 k the model is found to fail similar to studies on simple metals , such as au or ag.@xcite below 50 k a nonthermal electron model @xcite needs to be applied .    in order to account for the temperature dependence of the amplitude we developed a model assuming the photoinduced absorption mechanism , where the signal amplitude is proportional to the photoinduced change in the quasiparticle density .",
    "the model was found to account for the observed temperature dependence over wide temperature range .",
    "importantly , the model predicts a sublinear photoexcitation dependence at low temperatures which was not observed in the excitation range studied . this discrepancy may be due to the failure of the two - temperature model at low temperatures .",
    "the fact that the amplitude of the coherent @xmath0 phonon follows the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the fast electronic transient suggests that under the resonant condition both electronic and phononic responses are proportional to the change in the dielectric function .",
    "the damping and the frequency of the coherent @xmath0 phonon were also found to depend on the lattice temperature , which was explained by anharmonic phonon - phonon coupling , rather than pure dephasing , and by anharmonic frequency shift , respectively .",
    "there was no dependence of the frequency and the damping of the @xmath0 phonon on the pump fluence , suggesting that pure dephasing due to scattering with hot electrons is negligibly small . when increasing the pump fluence up to the millijoule per centimeter - squared range , the red - shift of the coherent @xmath0 mode frequency was observed , which was ascribed to thermal expansion .",
    "since the @xmath0 mode in zn may be sensitive to highly anisotropic compressional behavior of @xmath120 axial ratio in zn crystal ( hcp structure ) , as observed by raman scattering under pressure , controlling the amplitude and the frequency of the coherent @xmath0 phonon will be useful for the study of the gradual anisotropic @xmath121 isotropic transition occuring in zn.@xcite    the authors acknowledge hrvoje petek and viktor kabanov for helpful comments .",
