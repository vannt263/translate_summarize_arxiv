    "in practical realizations of josephson devices @xcite , one has to deal with capacitance disorder caused either by offset charge defects in the junctions or in the substrate ( random offset charges ) @xcite or by imperfections in the construction of the devices , which may lead to random capacitances of the josephson junctions .",
    "random offset charges can not be made to vanish by using a gate for each superconducting island since in large arrays too many electrodes would be necessary ( i.e. , too complicated fabrication procedures ) . in principle , an external uniform charge can be introduced and tuned in josephson junctions arrays ( jja s ) by applying a gate voltage with respect to the ground plane : in ref.@xcite this situation was analyzed experimentally by placing a gate underneath a josephson array and it was observed a sensible variation ( @xmath3 ) of the resistance between the unfrustrated and the fully frustrated array . although from a theoretical point of view charge and magnetic frustrations are dual to each other , experimentally it is possible to tune only the magnetic frustration in a controlled way .",
    "for this reason , it is widely believed that a challenging task for the theory is to develop reliable techniques to investigate the effects of random charge frustration on the phase structure of the arrays .    in this paper",
    ", we shall address the problem of determining the finite temperature phase diagram of jja s with capacitive disorder ( i.e. , with random offset charges and/or random self - capacitances ) . to derive the phase boundary between the insulating and the superconducting phase",
    ", we shall use a mean - field ( mf ) theory approach in the path - integral approach for quantum jja s with offset charges and general capacitance matrices @xcite .",
    "we find that the charge disorder supports superconductivity and that the relative variations of the insulating and superconducting regions depend on the mean value @xmath4 of the charge probability distribution : when @xmath5 , increasing the disorder leads to an enlargement of the superconducting phase .",
    "if the charge disorder is sufficiently strong ( @xmath0 ) , the lobe structure @xcite disappears : in other words , the phase boundary line ( and the correlation functions ) does not depend any longer on @xmath4 . in the following , we shall provide a quantitative analysis of this phenomenon .",
    "we shall consider gaussian , uniform ( as in ref.@xcite ) and @xmath6-like distributions .",
    "for @xmath7 our results agree with the results obtained in refs.@xcite and @xcite . also the randomness of the self - capacitances leads to remarkable effects : the superconducting phase increases with respect to the case where disorder is not present .",
    "we shall also compare the results of the functional mf approach with the molecular mf discussed in appendix b.    the hamiltonian commonly used to describe the cooper pair tunneling in superconducting quantum networks defines the so called quantum phase model ( qpm ) .",
    "in its most general form it is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the phase of the superconducting order parameter at grain @xmath10 .",
    "its conjugate variable @xmath11 ( @xmath12=i\\:\\delta_{{\\bf i } { \\bf j}}$ ] ) describes the number of cooper pairs in the @xmath10th superconducting grain .",
    "the symbol @xmath13 indicates a sum over nearest - neighbor grains only .",
    "the second term in the hamiltonian ( [ qpm ] ) describes the hopping of cooper pairs between neighboring sites ( @xmath14 is the josephson energy ) .",
    "the first term determines the electrostatic coupling between the cooper pairs : @xmath15 is the excess of charge due to cooper pairs ( @xmath16 ) on site @xmath10 and @xmath17 is the capacitance matrix . an external gate voltage @xmath18 gives the contribution to the energy via the offset charge @xmath19 .",
    "this external voltage can be either applied to the ground plane or , more interestingly , it may be induced by charges trapped in the substrate . in the latter situation",
    "@xmath20 is a random variable : the effects of this randomness on the phase diagram are the main object of our investigation .",
    "we shall also treat explicitly the case of random self - capacitance @xmath21 which correspond to a random charging energy @xmath22 .    as is well known @xcite , the qpm ( [ qpm ] ) is equivalent to the boson hubbard model ( bhm ) in the limit of large particle numbers per junction .",
    "the bhm describes soft - core bosons hopping on a lattice fisher89 and is defined as @xmath23 here , @xmath24",
    "( @xmath25 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for bosons and @xmath26 is the number operator . by writing the field @xmath25 in terms of its amplitude and phase and by neglecting the deviations of the amplitude from its average",
    ", we are lead to the qpm ( [ qpm ] ) .",
    "an exact mapping between the two models has been derived in ref .",
    "the hopping term is associated with the josephson tunneling ( @xmath27 ) whereas @xmath28 describes the coulomb interactions between bosons .",
    "the chemical potential in the bhm plays a role analogous to the one of the external charge in the qpm ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "thus a qpm with random offset charge corresponds to a bhm with random on - site energies .",
    "the disordered bhm has attracted much attention during the last decade fisher89,pazmandi95,kisker97,pazmandi97,herbut98,granato98,lee01 . in the pioneering work of fisher _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite the phase diagram at @xmath7 was studied . without disorder ,",
    "the bhm exhibits two types of phases : a superfluid phase and a mott insulating phase , with the latter characterized by integer ( or commensurate ) boson densities , by the existence of a gap for the particle - hole excitations , and by zero compressibility .",
    "the phase structure is determined by the two competing terms of the hamiltonian : the charging energy leads to a charge localization in the array , while the josephson energy induces a phase coherence giving rise to the overall array superfluidity .",
    "when disorder is present , a third , intermediate , phase occurs : the bose glass ( bg ) .",
    "this phase has an infinite superfluid susceptibility , but no gap and finite compressibility .",
    "it was early realized that considering uniform probability distributions there is no bg in the mf fisher89 .",
    "however , it has been shown that introducing a not uniform triangular probability distribution of offset charges the bg phase appears in the mf phase diagram @xcite . a direct mott insulator to superfluid transition without",
    "an intervening bg phase for weak disorder has been recently investigated in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "very recently , the phase diagram of the two - dimensional disordered bhm has been studied at @xmath7 by means of monte carlo simulations @xcite evidencing the existence of a bose glass to superfluid transition in the strong - disorder regime .    in the present paper",
    "we shall consider uniform disorder distributions : our mf approach distinguishes the phases with order parameter @xmath30 equal to zero ( insulating region ) or different from zero ( superconducting region ) , but it can not capture the bg .",
    "therefore , the full phase diagram is much richer than the mf one .",
    "it is obvious that for @xmath31 ( e.g. jj chains @xcite ) the mf fails to provide reliable information .",
    "however , the mf allows us to take a first step towards the understanding of the properties of the disordered jja and bhm at finite temperature .",
    "furthermore , conventional wisdom suggests that for large dimensions the mf approach provides the correct phase diagram of the system .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in section ii , we outline the mf theory for the pure quantum jja and then we compute the free energy averaged over the disorder . in this way we are able to get a general formula for the phase boundary line at finite temperature .",
    "section iii is devoted to the study of the effects of random offset charges with diagonal and nearest - neighbor capacitance matrices . in section",
    "iv we consider random self - capacitances .",
    "to check our results , we study in appendix a the infinite - range hopping limit and provide in appendix b an alternative and more intuitive mf approach for jja s in the presence of capacitive disorder .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "in a functional approach which makes use of the hubbard - stratonovich transformation , the partition function of quantum jja s may be written as @xcite @xmath32 } \\label{13}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 if @xmath35 are nearest neighbors and equals zero otherwise ( i.e. , the hopping term just between nearest neighbors ) .",
