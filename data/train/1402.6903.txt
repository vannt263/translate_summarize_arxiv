    "an oft - ignored aspect of architecture level thermal modeling is the heat spreader .",
    "the _ heat spreader _ is typically a nickel coated copper plate placed between the die and the heat sink ( see figure  [ fig : spreader ] ) .",
    "its main role is to uniformly dissipate the heat generated by the die , and transmit the heat to the heat sink .",
    "the heat sink is a large fin based heat exchanger that is used to effectively dissipate the heat to the surrounding air .",
    "the heat spreader effectively `` spreads out '' the heat and reduces the severity and incidence of thermal hot spots .",
    "given the fact that the heat spreader is nothing more than a metal plate , and does not have a lot of inherent complexity , it has not received a lot of attention by the architecture community . some prior work such as  @xcite ,",
    "have treated it as an isotherm ( equal temperature at all points ) .",
    "we experimentally disprove this hypothesis in this paper .",
    "skadron et .",
    "@xcite treat the spreader as a mesh of points , where each point is a heat source and two adjacent points are connected by a thermal resistance in their widely available thermal modeling tool , hotspot .",
    "however , there has been some recent criticism of the equivalent thermal circuit based approach adopted by hotspot in  @xcite .",
    "these works have reported a mean error of about 10% in hotspot .    ]",
    "we are currently working on developing a new temperature estimation tool . during the course of this work , we wish to look at the spreader from an experimental viewpoint .",
    "there are several reasons for our belief that the spreader warrants a more thorough study .",
    "( 1 ) the conductivity of silicon is roughly 100 w / m - k  @xcite , whereas the conductivity of the spreader is about 400 w / m - k .",
    "consequently , the spreader is a far more efficient lateral conductor of heat than silicon especially at distances of the order of the dimensions of the die .",
    "this has important implications for floor planning , thermal management , and task allocation in multicores .",
    "for example , it is possible for a set of active cores to heat up a set of relatively quiescent cores by passing heat through the spreader .",
    "this will hurt the performance of the relatively inactive cores , as well as long term lifetime reliability .",
    "( 2 ) we can use the spreader temperature data that we collect to calibrate temperature simulators .",
    "( 3 ) we can measure some thermal properties of the spreader and use it to quantify the degradation of the material over time .",
    "we can use this empirical data to perform more accurate fem simulations .",
    "lastly , for intel based chips that integrate the spreader with the die , it is not possible to study the temperature profile of the die independently",
    ". we need to infer its thermal profile by analyzing the temperature gradients on the spreader .",
    "we performed a simple thought experiment as follows .",
    "we consider a die with a large number of cores ( 128 ) , and assumed that there is lateral heat conduction just through the spreader .",
    "we use typical parameters from the hotspot tool ( version 5.0 )  @xcite , and simulated a scenario in which each core dissipates enough power to increase the die temperature measured at the center by 20@xmath0c .",
    "we now turn off a set of cores , and measure the effect that the active cores have on the inactive cores .",
    "we plot the average temperature rise of the inactive cores in figure  [ fig : active ] as a fraction of the number of active cores .",
    "figure  [ fig : mttf ] shows the normalized decrease in the mttf ( mean time to failure ) for three major failure mechanisms : electro - migration , thermal cycling , and stress migration ( see srinivasan et .",
    "@xcite ) . we observe that lateral heat conduction can have a significant impact on inactive cores .",
    "it can heat them up by 10 to 20@xmath0c , and can decrease their mttf by upto 10x .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we observe that experiment ii was inconclusive .",
    "it only reaffirmed the fact that a temperature differential exists across the spreader . to get a better picture ,",
    "we are in the process of setting up a detailed fem simulation framework that will be seeded by parameters obtained from our experiments .",
    "we describe a method to calculate the thermal conductivity of the spreader material ( nickel coated copper plate ) .",
    "the _ thermal conductivity _ of a material is defined as the power that flows across a temperature gradient of 1@xmath0c in an object that has unit length and unit cross - sectional area .",
    "conceptually , it is similar to electrical conductivity , and can be used to find the steady state distribution of temperature .",
    "we use the comparative method .",
    "this method proposes to place the unknown sample ( sliver of the spreader material ) between two samples ( copper wires ) with known thermal conductivity .",
    "both the ends of this ensemble are set to constant temperatures by dipping them in ice and boiling water respectively .",
    "the thermal conductivities are related by the following equation . @xmath1    here",
    ", @xmath2 is the thermal conductivity of copper ( 400 w / m - k ) , and @xmath3 is the unknown thermal conductivity of the spreader .",
    "@xmath4 refers to copper wire 1 , @xmath5 refers to copper wire 2 , @xmath6 refers to the spreader sample , @xmath7 represents the cross - sectional area , and @xmath8 represents the length of the wire .",
    "the temperature gradient , @xmath9 , is measured using thermocouples .",
    "the intuition behind this equation is that there is a constant amount of heat flow in the assembly of wires .",
    "note that equation  [ eqn : comp ] is over - constrained .",
    "we create two sets of equations  ( 1 ) between the spreader and wire 1 , and ( 2 ) between the spreader and wire 2 .",
    "we solve them separately and report the mean value of thermal conductivity .",
    "figure  [ fig : setupcomp ] shows the measurement setup with the two copper wires , spreader sample , and six thermocouples . each adjacent pair of thermocouples measures the temperature difference across a homogeneous section of material .",
    "note that equation  [ eqn : comp ] can be used only when there is exclusively conductive heat transfer through the ensemble .",
    "we need to reduce convective and radiative heat transfer to the maximum extent possible .",
    "consequently , we covered the setup with thermally insulating glass wool .",
    "lastly , we set the reference temperature at both ends using boiling water and ice respectively",
    ". the entire setup is shown in figure  [ fig : fullsetup ] .",
    "we allowed upto 4 - 5 hours for the readings to stabilize . the experimental procedure ( 10 repetitions , thermocouple interchange )",
    "is the same as that mentioned in section  [ sec : exp1 ] .",
    "we obtain a thermal conductivity value of 369 w / m - k ( @xmath10@xmath0c ) . for reference ,",
    "the thermal conductivity of copper is 400 w / m - k , and the thermal conductivity of nickel is 90.9 w / m - k .",
    "in the course of this work , we get an in - vivo estimate of the nature of temperature gradients on the surface of the heat spreader .",
    "we would like to extend our work to make more detailed and elaborate measurements . in specific",
    ", we would like to drill very fine holes ( diameter less than 100 nm ) on the heat sink and measure the temperatures at the center of the spreader also .",
    "lastly , using empirical data collected from our studies , we wish to correlate our measurements with fem based simulations . the final goal is four fold  ( 1 ) create a corpus of empirically measured temperature data , ( 2 ) propose accurate temperature simulation methodologies for semi - conductor packages , and ( 3 ) design new packaging technologies that are more thermally efficient , and lastly ( 4 ) come up with new architectures that can leverage these advances in novel packaging technologies .        j.  srinivasan and s.  adve , `` the importance of heat - sink modeling for dtm and a correction to predictive dtm for multimedia applications , '' in _ proceedings of the fourth annual workshop on duplicating , deconstructing , and debunking ( wddd ) at isca-05 _ , 2005 .",
