    "ever since the establishment of general relativity , the search for the true nature of gravitational field has never ceased . in einstein s geometric description , the gravitational force is regarded as an effect of curved spacetime .",
    "nevertheless , einstein himself proposed in 1920 that `` according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities '' @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , eddington suggested that the deflection of light in a curved spacetime can be imaged as a refraction effect in a flat spacetime @xcite . and",
    "wilson related this refractive index to the variable specific inductive capacity of the `` ether '' near matter , i.e. , suggested an electromagnetic theory of gravitation @xcite .",
    "later , in 1957 , dicke @xcite , pointed out that vacuum polarization @xcite can account for such `` ether '' .",
    "recently , puthoff reemphasized such an interpretation of gravitational field , and suggested an exponential form of the vacuum dielectric constant or vacuum refractive index @xcite .",
    "vlokh further investigated the constitutive coefficients that could characterize the space as matter , and proposed the concept of optical - frequency dielectric impermeability perturbed by a gravitational field @xcite .",
    "the dielectric - like vacuum interpretation of gravitational field has led to successful analysis of the gravitational effects such as the gravitational red shift , the light deflection , the time delay , the gravitational lensing , and so on @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the relation between the gravitational field and the quantum vacuum will be discussed further .",
    "first , the gravitational metric tensor will be analysed and a corresponding graded refractive index in the flat spacetime will be deduced .",
    "this refractive index implies a variable dielectric tensor of the gravitational space , which is essentially related to the polarization of vacuum .",
    "then , through the analysis of the intensity of vacuum polarization , the number density of the virtual charge pairs in vacuum will be found to be a function of the gravitational mass @xmath0 and the distance @xmath1 .",
    "this analysis leads to a polarizable vacuum interpretation of the gravitational force .",
    "finally , the anisotropic propagation of light in a vacuum will be discussed .",
    "the general relativity states that spacetime will be curved by the gravitational matter .",
    "a curved spacetime can be described by the four - dimensional riemann space , where the velocity of light in vacuum is defined as a constant @xmath2 .",
    "the interval @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the proper time ) between the two adjacent points in this space is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the coordinates of the point , for example , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 denotes the coordinate time ) , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the metric tensor @xmath13    for a static and spherically symmetric gravitational matter with mass @xmath0 , the schwarzschild exterior solution gives the metric @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , differing from the radius @xmath1 in flat spacetime , is the radial coordinate of the metric , @xmath18 is the gravitational constant , @xmath19 and @xmath20 have the same meaning as those in the usual spherical coordinates .",
    "the above equation gives the metric tensor @xmath21    in a rectangular coordinate system of flat spacetime , if we set @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 , differing to the constant velocity @xmath2 , is the velocity of light in vacuum at distance @xmath1 from the gravitational centre in flat spacetime ) , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , then eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be rewritten as @xmath27 and the metric tensor will be @xmath28    since the metric tensor of a flat spacetime satisfies @xmath29 , we have @xmath30 @xmath31    considering @xmath32 at infinity , eq .",
    "( 8) gives @xmath33 or @xmath34    combining eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 9 ) , we get the refractive index @xmath35 or through eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 10 ) , we get @xmath36    the above results are in agreement with those obtained through an optical way @xcite .",
    "if we set a new tensor @xmath37 , each of its elements is the square root of the corresponding element of @xmath38 , then we have @xmath39    in weak field approximation , @xmath40 , the tensor becomes @xmath41    the above result implies a variable dielectric tensor @xmath42 of vacuum around gravitational matter : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the constant permittivity of vacuum without the influence of gravitational matter .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 15 ) correspond to a graded refractive index of the vacuum @xmath45 and a variable light velocity in gravitational field @xmath46",
    "it is noticed that the electric displacement vector * d * in a dielectric medium can be written as @xmath47 where * p * represents the polarization of dielectric medium , @xmath48 is the polarization of vacuum @xcite , * e * denotes the electric field intensity .    for the vacuum around gravitational matter , the variable dielectric tensor expressed by eq .",
    "( 15 ) indicates that the intensity of vacuum polarization will be @xmath49    as we know that , the intensity of dielectric polarization is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number density of electric dipoles in the dielectric medium , @xmath52 is the electronic charge , @xmath53 is the stiffness factor .",
    "similarly , we suppose the intensity of vacuum polarization to be @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number density of the virtual charge pairs @xmath56 in the vacuum at a distance @xmath1 from the gravitational mass @xmath0 .",
    "thus we have @xmath57 or @xmath58    in general relativity , a clock at a distance @xmath1 from the gravitational centre is slower than that at infinity .",
    "this effect of time dilatation can be understood as the frequency reduction of the virtual dipoles in gravitational field , that is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the equivalent mass of a virtual dipole at distance @xmath1 , @xmath61 is the corresponding angular frequency at infinity . considering the energy ratio of a virtual dipole at distance @xmath1 to that at infinity @xmath62 we have @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the corresponding equivalent mass at infinity .",
    "( 24 ) and ( 26 ) give the relation @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the stiffness factor at infinity .",
    "therefore @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number density of the virtual dipoles at infinity .",
    "this result is very similar to the number density distribution of gas molecules in a gravitational field : @xmath69 where we have used the relations @xmath70 ( the potential energy of a gas molecule ) and @xmath71 ( the average translational kinetic energy of a molecule ) .",
    "( 28 ) can be rewritten as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of virtual dipoles in a volume of @xmath74 at infinity or in a volume of @xmath75 at a distance @xmath1 from the gravitational centre .",
    "so we have the length relation @xmath76 which increases our understanding of the length contraction effect in gravitational field .",
    "it is the effects of time dilatation described by eq .",
    "( 24 ) and length contraction described by eq .",
    "( 31 ) that leads to the slowing down of the light velocity @xmath23 in a gravitational field as expressed in eq .",
    "( 17 ) , which , in general relativity , is regarded as a constant light velocity @xmath2 in a curved spacetime .",
    "eq .  ( 28 ) tells that the number density of the virtual dipoles in vacuum decreases with the distance @xmath1 from the gravitational centre .",
    "this result indicates that there can be a polarizable vacuum interpretation of the gravitational force .",
    "consider the number density of the virtual dipoles around a @xmath77-charged particle in a gravitational field.,title=\"fig:\",width=259 ]   consider the number density of the virtual dipoles around a @xmath77-charged particle in a gravitational field.,title=\"fig:\",width=259 ]    first we consider a @xmath77-charged particle located at a distance @xmath1 from a gravitational mass @xmath0 as shown in fig .  1 ( a ) . according to eq .",
    "( 28 ) , the number density of the virtual dipoles around the charged particle is @xmath78\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\   \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\nonumber\\\\ = n_{\\textnormal{p}'0 } \\exp\\left[\\frac{3g}{c^2}\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt{x^2+(y+r)^2}}+\\frac{m}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the mass of the particle , @xmath80 is the distance from the particle to a nearby point p(@xmath81,@xmath82 ) , @xmath83 is the distance from the point to the gravitational matter @xmath0 . the corresponding contour map of @xmath55 is shown in fig .  1 ( b ) , where a relatively central contour line has higher value of number density than an outer one . from the figure",
    "we know that , for a given distance @xmath80 , the virtual dipoles in vacuum below the charged particle ( @xmath84 ) are denser than that above the charged particle ( @xmath85 ) . then there is a slightly higher probability for the charged particle to be coupled or `` attracted '' by the virtual dipoles at the lower side , which leads to the downward movement of the charged particle , or in other words , leads to the gravitational force on the particle .    for an electrically neutral particle or neutral matter",
    ", its inner distribution of positive and negative charges will in the same way lead to the effect of gravitational force .",
    "once the gravitational metric tensor is associated with the dielectric tensor of the vacuum , it is natural to have the idea that the tensor may be in a more general form under certain conditions , that is @xmath86 if so , the vacuum in a specific gravitational field will exhibit its anisotropic characteristics in polarization .",
    "for example , a vacuum in a nonstatic gravitational field may no longer keep the relation of @xmath80=@xmath87=@xmath2 and may behave somewhat like a birefringent crystal . in such a case , there may be an anisotropic propagation of light in the gravitational field .",
    "the gravitational birefringence in a vacuum is an analogy of the photoelastic effect . in the latter case",
    ", an isotropic material turns to be anisotropic and shows its birefringent characteristic in light propagation when a stress is applied to the material .",
    "similarly , if altered by a specific electric or magnetic field , an isotropic vacuum may be turned into an anisotropic one just as an isotropic dielectric medium will be . in such a case",
    ", there may be birefringence observed in the altered vacuum as the electro - optic or magneto - optic effect observed in a dielectric medium .",
    "it is delightful that the anisotropic propagation of light in vacuum has attracted both theoretical and experimental interests in recent years @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that substantial observational proof will be found for the birefringence of light in a gravity - or - electromagnetism - influenced vacuum .",
    "the curved spacetime in general relativity is described by a gravitational metric tensor .",
    "it is found that this tensor corresponds to a variable dielectric tensor of vacuum around gravitational matter if viewed in a flat spacetime .",
    "in such a view , the vacuum possesses a graded refractive index , which slows down the velocity of light propagating to a gravitational body .",
    "this medium - like property of gravitational space is attributed to the virtual charge pairs in vacuum .",
    "the increasing number density of virtual dipoles towards to the gravitational centre naturally suggests a polarizable vacuum interpretation of the gravitational force .",
    "in addition , a dielectric tensor of vacuum could be in a more general form than that with equal diagonal elements , which makes it possible that a vacuum under certain conditions turns to be anisotropic .",
    "so , great importance is attached to the observations or experiments searching for anisotropic propagation of light in a vacuum modified by specific gravitational or electromagnetic fields ."
