    "it is widely accepted and proved rigorously in many cases that elementary excitations in disordered media are localized if the disorder is strong enough or / and the energy of the excitations is close enough to the band edges .",
    "the idea dates back to the famous paper @xcite by p. anderson who emphasized , in particular , the aspects related to the transition from localized to delocalized states .",
    "the idea was further developed by n. mott and i. lifshitz ( see e.g. their review works @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it was i. lifshitz who singled out the regime of high disorder or low energy where the localization is most pronounced .",
    "this regime is now known as the strong localization regime . according to i. lifshitz ,",
    "in this case , the pertinent realizations of the random potential have the form of a collection of deep potential wells which are so rare and whose form is so irregular that the quantum mechanical probability for tunnelling through a macroscopic number of the localization wells vanishes .",
    "the study of localization and relevant physical characteristics of disordered systems can be reduced to the study of moments of the density operator @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the ( one - body ) hamiltonian of the system . by using the coordinate representation ,",
    "we can write the @xmath2-th moment ( @xmath2-th correlation function ) as follows : @xmath3where the @xmath4 denotes averaging with respect to the disorder .",
    "the simplest case of the correlation function ( [ kl ] ) , corresponding to @xmath5 , @xmath6 : @xmath7i.e .",
    ", to the average of the local density of states @xmath8 , is known as the density of states ( dos ) of the system .",
    "i. lifshitz suggested a non - perturbative method of computing the asymptotic form of the dos in the strong localization regime @xcite .",
    "the above description of typical realizations of the random potential is implemented in this method by the assumption of independent quantization of a quantum particle in each localization well ( see @xcite ) , thus the complete localization of a particle in an exponential neighborhood of each well . a rigorous proof of the complete and exponential localization in the strong localization regime was given by j. frhlich and t. spencer fr - sp:83,ma - sc , pa - fi:92 .",
    "in both these important results of the localization theory the tunnelling between the localization wells plays no significant role . in lifshitz s argument , other wells are simply ignored .",
    "the crucial ingredient in the rigorous proof of the complete localization in the strong localization regime is a rather sophisticated probabilistic extension of the kolmogorov - arnold - moser theory ( known as the multi - scale analysis ) which allows one to verify that tunnelling between wells is strongly suppressed , and therefore does not change qualitatively the picture , suggested by the independent wells quantization assumption .",
    "the dos determines equilibrium properties of a disordered system in the one - body approximation , i.e. , of the ideal fermi gas in a random external field .",
    "the study of kinetic properties of the gas and of interaction effects requires the knowledge of higher moments ( [ kl ] ) of the density operator @xmath9 , especially the second moment @xmath10 .",
    "important quantities that can be expressed via @xmath10 are the density - density correlator and the current - current correlator @xcite .",
    "these correlators allow us to answer relevant questions concerning the nature of localization and the behavior of the conductivity and other physical characteristics .",
    "the complete localization of states in a certain interval of energies implies that the zero temperature d.c .",
    "conductivity vanishes if the fermi energy lies in this interval ( see @xcite for a proof and a discussion ) . on the other hand , since the energies of localized states are dense , the zero - temperature a.c .",
    "conductivity is expected to be non - zero for any non - zero frequency @xmath11 of the external field .",
    "it was n. mott who first proposed resonant  tunnelling between pairs of wells as a mechanism of the low frequency a.c .",
    "conductivity in localized systems @xcite . according to mott",
    ", one can view those states , resulting from independent quantization in each localization well ( localization center in mott s terminology ) , as a kind of bare  states .",
    "they decay exponentially in the distance from the corresponding localization center .",
    "two ( several ) bare states with widely spaced centers but with sufficiently close energies can resonate .",
    "this leads to the two - center states ( resp .",
    "multi center states ) , whose energies are exponentially close in the separation between the centers .",
    "the condition for a pair of wells to be in resonance determines the distance between resonating wells , thereby determining the characteristic value of the dipole moment of two bare states of wells , and the square of the dipole moment is , in essence , the conductivity according to the linear response theory ( see formula ( [ ku2 ] ) below ) .",
    "this observation leads to the following asymptotic expression for the low frequency conductivity : @xmath12 in the case , where @xmath13here @xmath14 is the temperature , @xmath11 the frequency of an alternating external field , @xmath15 the fermi energy ( supposed to be in the localized spectrum ) .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are determined by the fundamental constants and by the random potential .",
    "formula ( [ mott ] ) was discussed in many works ( see e.g. ef - sh:84,ef , ha - jo:91,go , go - co , lgp , mo - da:71,we - co and section 5 ) . however , a consistent `` first principle '' derivation of the formula  is still not available in a general multi - dimensional case .",
    "we mean a derivation based on the kubo formula ( see formulas ( [ ku1])([ku2 ] ) below ) , in which the two - point correlation function is computed for a given random potential in the asymptotic regime ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "the fact that such a derivation is still missing encourages us to present in this paper a heuristic method that allows us to obtain formula ( [ mott ] ) and some other two - point correlation functions ( i.e. , ( [ kl ] ) for @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , and that , we believe , clarifies mott s initial arguments .",
    "the method is based on the above hypothesis on the form of pertinent realizations of the random potential as systems of deep and rare localization wells .",
    "viewing the density of wells as a small parameter of the theory , we apply a version of the virial expansion to compute the leading contribution to the moments @xmath20 of ( [ kl ] ) for @xmath21 . in particular , by applying this procedure to the dos , we find that its leading order is the density of the localization wells .",
    "this shows that the small parameter of the theory is the dos itself , whose smallness is known to be an important condition for localization .",
    "furthermore , we find that the leading order of the pair correlation functions , the a.c .",
    "conductivity in particular , is determined by two - center states , resulting from resonant tunnelling between a pair of localization wells , in agreement with mott s ideas .",
    "this leads to formula ( [ mott ] ) and , therefore , supports the idea of pair approximation in mott s derivation of ( [ mott ] ) . among our other results ,",
    "we mention high peaks of some pair correlation functions ( see ( c1 ) and ( [ c2 ] ) below ) , appearing in a neighborhood of the origin and on the resonating  distance , determined by the frequency of the external field .",
    "analogous peaks were found before in the one - dimensional case for strong localization @xcite as well as in the weak localization regime @xcite .",
    "however , in these cases , the peaks are of the order @xmath22 , while in the general @xmath23-dimensional case , the peaks are of the order @xmath24 , i.e. , much bigger in the regime ( [ cond ] ) ( see also @xcite for a similar result ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline the method . in section 3 the mott formula ( [ mott ] ) is derived . in section 4",
    "we derive asymptotic formulas for binary correlators and in section 5 we comment on our results and on their relations to known results .",
    "it was already mentioned in the introduction that extensive studies of the strong localization regime show that the phenomenon is determined by realizations of the random potential , containing deep and rare potential wells . for a potential unbounded below ( like the poisson potential ( pois ) below )",
    "the large parameter of the theory is the absolute value of the energy and/or the amplitude of the potential .",
    "these two cases of the strong localization regime are manifestations of the simplest mechanism of localization : capturing a quantum particle in strong and rare fluctuations of a random potential .    in other words , for an overwhelming majority of eigenfunctions @xmath25 ,",
    "corresponding to the strongly localized part of the spectrum , there exists a point @xmath26 , the center of the localization well , such that @xmath25 decays as @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is the localization radius of @xmath25 .",
    "the localization centers have to be uniformly and chaotically distributed in space and the distances between them have to be much bigger than the typical localization radii and than the radii of the localization wells .",
    "hence , one has to expect an effective decoupling  between the localization wells .",
    "one obtains a simple form of this picture of the strong localization regime by replacing the random schrdinger operator by the direct sum of operators , each of them defined in a certain cell , containing a single localization well .",
    "this procedure of independent quantization in isolated cells is supported by and even instrumental in studies of the density of states , the interband light absorption coefficient , and other spectral and physical characteristics of disordered systems ( see e.g. mo:93,ef - sh:84,ki - pa:90,lgp ) , as well as of the probability distribution of spacings between adjacent energy levels ( see @xcite ) in the strong localization regime",
    ". however , the procedure is not appropriate in studies of transport properties of disordered systems .",
    "this is why we replace the procedure of independent quantization in isolated cells by the less restrictive assumption , according to which relevant properties of the strong localization regime can be described , assuming that any shortly correlated and smoothly distributed random potential can be replaced by an ( effective ) potential of the form : @xmath29here @xmath30 are the poisson random points of the density @xmath31 modelling the centers of the localization wells , and the random functions \\{@xmath32 } are independent of each others and independent of the @xmath30 .",
    "the \\{@xmath33 } model the shape of the localization wells .",
    "we assume that all @xmath33 s have a finite range and the typical radius @xmath34 of @xmath33 s is related to the typical distance @xmath35 between wells as @xmath36the density @xmath37 of the localization centers is not known and has to be found self - consistently .",
    "the density as well as the shapes of the wells may depend on the energy interval in question .",
    "in other words , we believe that the strong localization regime possesses a certain robustness ( insensitivity ) with respect to a concrete form of random potential , provided that it is translation invariant in the mean , shortly correlated , and smoothly distributed ( the last two properties facilitate the localization because they make it more unlikely that different localization wells are of the same shape , thereby suppressing tunnelling between different localization wells ) .",
    "one may say that our ansatz ( [ veff ] ) replaces impenetrable walls between cells of the independent quantization procedure by a kind of soft  walls , that strongly suppress particle mobility but do not exclude it completely .    to avoid technicalities",
    ", we will choose a simple form of the localization wells , setting @xmath38where @xmath39 is a finite range potential well and \\{@xmath40 } are independent identically distributed random variables , independent of \\{@xmath41 } and assuming arbitrary big positive values according to a smooth probability density @xmath42 .",
    "summarizing , we can write the following formula for the effective potential @xmath43it should be noted that similar random functions are widely used in localization theory as bare  random potentials in the schrdinger equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we mean the potentials of the form @xmath44where @xmath45 is a non - positive function of a finite range ( the single - impurity potential ) . in the case ,",
    "where @xmath46 are independent identically distributed random variables and @xmath47 form a regular lattice , the potential models a substitutional alloy , and in the case , where @xmath48 for all @xmath49 and @xmath47 are completely chaotic ( poisson ) random points of the density @xmath50 , the potential @xmath51models an amorphous medium . assuming that @xmath50 is large , @xmath52 is small but @xmath53 is fixed and shifting the energy by the mean value @xmath54of the potential ( [ pois ] )",
    ", we obtain a gaussian random potential with zero mean and with the correlation function @xmath55 in a more general case , where the @xmath47 are completely chaotic and the @xmath46 are identically distributed random variables , independent of each others and of the @xmath47 , ( [ pot ] ) is a generalized poisson potential .",
    "we would like to stress here that while our effective potential ( [ veff1 ] ) is similar to a generalized poisson one ( because of random @xmath40 s ) , these two should not be identified . in particular",
    ", the density @xmath50 of the impurity centers @xmath47 in ( [ pot ] ) is not the density @xmath37 of the localization centers @xmath30 in ( [ veff1 ] ) ( @xmath37 is usually is much smaller than @xmath50 ) , and the functions @xmath56 in ( [ pot ] ) , modelling the single impurity potential , have little in common with the functions @xmath33 in ( [ veff1 ] ) , modelling the form of the localization wells .",
    "the latter are formed by sufficiently large and dense clusters of impurities in which the inter - impurity distances are much smaller than the typical distance @xmath57 between impurities centers @xmath47 .",
    "for example , if the bare  random potential is given by ( [ pois ] ) , then it can be shown than the number of @xmath58 s in a typical localization well is of the order @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "recall that an important property of the effective potential is the small density @xmath37 of the localization centers ( cf ( [ amu ] ) ) .",
    "we describe now a technique that will allow us to use this property .",

    "it can also be shown that the two - well contribution to the dos is of the order @xmath103 .",

    "<S> we present a method that allows us to find the asymptotic form of various characteristics of disordered systems in the strong localization regime , i.e. , when either the random potential is big or the energy is close to a spectral edge . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on the hypothesis that the relevant realizations of the random potential in the strong localization regime have the form of a collection of deep random wells that are uniformly and chaotically distributed in space with a sufficiently small density . assuming this and using the density expansion , we show first that the density of wells coincides in leading order with the density of states . </S>",
    "<S> thus the density of states is in fact the small parameter of the theory in the strong localization regime . </S>",
    "<S> then we derive the mott formula for the low frequency conductivity and the asymptotic formulas for certain two - point correlators when the difference of the respective energies is small .    </S>",
