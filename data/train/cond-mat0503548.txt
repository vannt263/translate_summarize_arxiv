    "many real - world complex networks have heavy tails in the node degree distribution @xcite .",
    "it was a great discovery @xcite to realize that networks with such a property can be naturally produced by a preferential attachment growth @xcite .",
    "it has become an important issue to work out the consequences of the presence of heavy tails in the degree distribution on topological properties of networks @xcite .",
    "the degree distribution however gives only a crude information about topology of random networks unless it is supplemented by some other information .",
    "let us take as an example @xmath0-regular graphs .",
    "they are defined as graphs with all nodes having degree equal @xmath0 .",
    "the node degree distribution of @xmath0-regular graphs is @xmath1 independently of the graph topology .",
    "a regular equilateral triangulation or a cubic lattice are perfect examples of @xmath2-regular graphs but they have completely different topological and geometrical properties : the triangulation has fractal dimension two while the cubic lattice  three .",
    "one can see the difference when one determines for example the number of nodes in the given distance from the given node .",
    "the two examples of @xmath2-regular graphs are not random graphs so one could argue that maybe if one considered random graphs from the ensemble of @xmath2-regular graphs one would see statistically identical topological and geometrical properties of them . but to answer this question one has to define what a random graph is .",
    "one can do it by introducing a statistical ensemble of graphs @xcite .",
    "this means that one has to specify the set of graphs which one wants to study : as for instance @xmath0-regular graphs , trees , simple graphs , pseudographs , etc .",
    ", their attributes : directed , undirected , eulerian , connected , etc . then one has to define a probability measure on this set by ascribing to each graph from the set a positive number .",
    "this number gives ( after normalization ) the probability that the graph will be selected when the set is sampled randomly .",
    "the statistical properties of the ensemble heavily depend on the choice of the probability measure .",
    "the classical example of this approach is the ensemble of erds - rnyi graphs @xcite .",
    "the set of graphs consists of all graphs with @xmath3 nodes and @xmath4 links having neither multiple- nor self - connections .",
    "the measure in the erds - rnyi ensemble is defined as follows @xcite .",
    "one labels all nodes by the integers @xmath5 to obtain labeled graphs .",
    "such graphs are isomorphic to @xmath6 symmetric adjacency matrices with @xmath4 entries equal to one in the upper triangle ( and symmetrically also in the lower triangle ) .",
    "each labeled graph ( adjacency matrix ) has the same statistical weight .",
    "the partition function reads : @xmath7 the index @xmath8 stands for homogeneous and will be explained later .",
    "the first sum runs over all labeled graphs , the second over graphs ( = unlabeled graphs ) . by a graph",
    "we mean graph s topology that is the shape or skeleton which one obtains when one removes the labels .",
    "the number @xmath9 of distinct labelings ( adjacency matrices ) of the graph @xmath10 depends on @xmath10 and thus some graphs are more whereas some are less probable in this ensemble .",
    "one should realize that the definition assumes that a ) we can distinguish the vertices of the graph , b ) we are only interested in properties that do not depend on the labelings .",
    "the permutation of indices neither changes graphs topology nor physical quantities measured on this graph .",
    "the model has thus permutation symmetry and one should divide out the volume of the permutation group .",
    "one could explicitly write the factor of @xmath11 instead of @xmath12 in the sum .",
    "however , as long as @xmath3 is fixed this factor is constant and therefore can be pulled out in front of the sum and skipped as an irrelevant normalization of the partition function .",
    "one should keep it in any formula for an ensemble with varying @xmath3 as we will do in the next section ( see for example ) .",
    "the origin of this factor is the same as in classical statistical mechanics for identical particles .",
    "these assumptions are reasonable for many real ",
    "world examples of graphs , but one must be aware that they can be violated . for example when considering chemical compounds we must treat the vertices of the same kind as indistinguishable similarly as in quantum statistics",
    ". then we should use an ensemble where each graph topology has the same weight : @xmath13 . in practice",
    "such a definition turns out to be much more difficult to handle @xcite .",
    "also the ensembles , where the probability of selecting a given graph depends on its labels , appear naturally when one considers ensembles of growing networks @xcite .    in the erds - rnyi ensemble ( [ hg ] )",
    "all labeled graphs are equiprobable .",
    "one can however weight the graphs in a way which depends on their topology : for example one can introduce correlations between neighboring nodes degrees @xcite , one can favor loops @xcite which are very rare for the erds - rnyi graphs , or one can introduce a weight which modifies the node - degree distribution @xcite . in the last example",
    "one does it by modifying the partition function to the following form : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the degree of @xmath0-th node and @xmath16 is an arbitrary weight function .",
    "one can tune the weight function @xmath16 in order to obtain graphs with a desired probability distribution . in this way one can produce for example scale - free graphs with the barabsi - albert degree distribution @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we apply the concepts of statistical mechanics like statistical ensembles , partition function , averages over ensemble , and so forth to study random graphs . within this approach",
    "one has already obtained many interesting results @xcite .",
    "this approach is a straightforward generalization of the erds - rnyi ideas .    at the first glance",
    "one can think that the statistical mechanics is not adequate for growing networks which are not in equilibrium .",
    "indeed such ensembles can not be understood as equilibrium ensembles with the gibbs measure , having temperature etc .",
    "one should rather understand them as follows .",
    "imagine that one repeats the process of growth many times independently and each time one terminates it when the network reaches a given size .",
    "one obtains a collection of networks which occur with a certain probability .",
    "this perfectly defines an ensemble of graphs @xcite .",
    "it is not an equilibrium ensemble but all methods of statistical mechanics work , so one can use them . in order to distinguish growing networks which are inhomogeneous from homogeneous graphs discussed above ( for which all nodes are treated equally as for instance for erds - rnyi graphs ) we shall call the growing networks - _ causal _ , and the networks obtained from arbitrarily labeled graphs - _",
    "the difference will become clear in the next section .",
    "anticipating some results , the causal and homogeneous networks have different geometrical features even if they have identical node - degree distributions .",
    "vertices of a growing network can be labeled by integers representing the order of attachment to the network .",
    "it is clear that not all possible labelings of the underlying graph can be realized in this way ( see figure [ fig : causal - graph ] ) .",
    "we will call those that can be  _",
    "causal _ labelings or equivalently we will say that the labels are causally ordered .",
    "a necessary condition for a causal labelings is that a ) root has the smallest label and b ) one can connect every vertex to the root by a path ( not necessarily the shortest ) in such a way that the labels on it are increasing from the root .",
    "it implies a condition that every vertex except the root must have at least one neighbor with a smaller label .",

    "the difference between the two is that only causal labelings are allowed here . the second sum in ( [ cg ] ) is done over all graphs @xmath10 .",

    "when one samples graphs randomly in the homogeneous graphs ensemble ( [ hg ] ) one thus observes different probabilities of graphs ( topologies ) occurrence than in the ensemble of causal graphs .",
    "this can be illustrated by calculating various quantities for random tree graphs ( branched polymers ) for which the calculations can be done analytically @xcite .",
    "let us give a short account on results of those calculations .",
    "we shall discuss ensembles of planted rooted trees .",
    "each graph in such an ensemble is connected and has no loops .",

    ".     graphical representation of the self - consistency equation .",
    "the bubble contains the grand - canonical sum over planted rooted trees .",
    "each tree is weighed with the size factor @xmath26 and the small circle representing a single node gives additional factor @xmath27 . ]",
    "an advantage of using the grand - canonical partition function is that one can deduce a closed formula @xcite expressing @xmath28 as a function of itself : @xmath29 which can be graphically represented as in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the meaning of this graphical equation is the following .",
    "any rooted tree can be constructed by joining stems of a certain number of trees at a common node and attaching a new common stem to this node .",
    "if one sums over all trees in each bubble on the right - hand side of the graphical equation shown in figure [ fig1 ] , one obtains a sum over all trees also on the left - hand side . in order to obtain the partition function",
    "@xmath28 one has to take care of the power of @xmath27 which counts the number of vertices .",
    "we see that the new tree has by one vertex more than all subtrees used in the construction so one has to multiply the right - hand side by @xmath27 . in order to avoid overcounting while joining @xmath0 trees , which now form @xmath0 branches of the new tree",
    ", one has to divide out the factor @xmath30 which counts the number of indistinguishable ways in which one can put the trees together .",
    "thus the expression @xmath31 which represents the composition of @xmath0 subtrees is divided by @xmath30",
    ". finally , one has to sum over @xmath0 to include all branching possibilities at the root . in this way one reproduces the partition function @xmath32 on the left - hand side and @xmath33 on the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "using the equation one can determine @xmath22 by inverse laplace transform ( here written as a contour integral ) : @xmath34 changing the integration variable from @xmath27 to @xmath35 and by means of one obtains @xmath36 this result tells us that there are @xmath37 labeled planted rooted trees of size @xmath3 .",

    "can deduce the number of all labeled trees without any marked vertex . on a tree with @xmath3 vertices",
    "one can mark one of @xmath3 vertices , so the number of trees with a marked vertex must be @xmath3 times larger than the total number of labeled trees .",
    "thus the number of labeled trees of size @xmath3 is @xmath42 .",
    "this is the classical result derived first by cayley ( see reference @xcite for general introduction on counting graphs ) .",
    "let us come back to planted rooted trees , but now consider only causally labeled ones .",
    "for the trees we have exactly one path joining any given vertex and the root and along this path labels must increase from the root outwards ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "one can derive @xcite a self - consistency equation for causal planted rooted trees similarly to .",
    "it has the same logical structure as the graphical equation shown in figure [ fig1 ] but the causality imposes a requirement on labels ordering .",
    "a careful analysis of the consequences implied by this requirement shows that one obtains the following self - consistency equation for causal trees @xcite : @xmath43 this equation can be solved for @xmath44 yielding : @xmath45 and hence : @xmath46 thus there are @xmath47 causally labeled planted rooted trees .",
    "for example , there is one for @xmath38 , one for @xmath39 and two for @xmath40 , etc .",
    "one can easily find these trees among all labeled trees in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "causally labeled trees form a small subset of all labeled trees : the fraction of causally labeled trees @xmath48 quickly disappears when the size of the system grows . one may ask whether the statistical properties of this subset are identical as of the whole set .",
    "the answer is that they are completely different .",
    "probably the most striking difference is that the causal trees are much more compact and have much smaller linear extent than homogeneous trees .",
    "one can quantify this statement by checking how the average distance between nodes depends on the size of the tree .",
    "one defines geodesic distance @xmath49 for each pair of vertices @xmath50 as the number of links of the ( shortest ) path between @xmath51 and @xmath52 . to get the average distance",
    "one averages @xmath49 over all pairs of nodes on the tree and over all trees in the ensemble .",
    "the result is that for homogeneous trees the average distance behaves for large @xmath3 as @xcite : @xmath53 while for causal ones @xcite : @xmath54 the power - law growth of the linear extent @xmath55 with the system size means that homogeneous trees have fractal dimension @xmath56 , while the behavior @xmath57 that the fractal dimension of causal trees is @xmath58 .",
    "the separation of vertices on a causal tree is very small and the whole tree structure is compactly concentrated around the oldest part of the tree .",
    "this can be well illustrated by studying the two - point correlation function @xmath59 : @xmath60 the delta function @xmath61 selects only pairs @xmath50 separated by @xmath62 edges .",
    "the two - point function can be thus interpreted as the probability that two randomly chosen nodes of the tree are separated by @xmath62 links .",
    "alternatively it can be interpreted as the distance distribution giving the fraction of nodes at a distance @xmath62 from a randomly chosen one . by construction , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the average distance between vertices is given by the mean value of the two - point function : @xmath65 the two - point function gives a very valuable information about the distance distribution in the given ensemble of graphs . in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we compare the two - point function @xmath66 for homogeneous and @xmath67 for causal trees of the same size @xmath68 .",
    "the distance distribution functions for the homogeneous ( circles ) and causal trees ( diamonds ) for @xmath68 .",
    "error bars for data points represented by circles are smaller than the symbol size . ]",
    "one sees that indeed the typical causal trees are much shorter than homogeneous .",
    "the distance distribution for causal trees is much more concentrated .",
    "one can analytically derive the shape of the two - point function @xmath66 for homogeneous trees in the limit of @xmath69 . in this limit",
    "one can approximate the shape by a function of a continuous variable : @xmath70 where @xmath51 is a positive constant .",
    "we have : @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the large @xmath3 limit the two - point function becomes effectively an @xmath3-independent function of the scaling variable @xmath73 : @xmath74 when one draws the two - point functions for different system sizes as a function of the scaling variable the corresponding curves collapse to a universal shape independent of @xmath3 .",
    "it will be illustrated below for the scale - free graphs .",
    "the situation is completely different for causal ( growing ) trees @xcite .",
    "first of all , the mean distance @xmath75 grows like @xmath76 and not like @xmath77 .",
    "second of all , the two - point functions @xmath78 for different sizes do not collapse after the rescaling @xmath79 .",
    "if the scaling hold , the dispersion of @xmath78 would grow like @xmath80 .",
    "we shall see below that it grows only like @xmath76 .",
    "let us first calculate the average number of vertices of the causal tree @xmath81 in the distance @xmath62 from the root - a quantity which is closely related to the two point function .",
    "since the causal tree is constructed recursively by adding new vertices we can write the following recursive relation : @xmath82 which tells us that the new vertex added in the distance @xmath62 from the root must be linked to a vertex in the distance @xmath83 .",
    "the factor @xmath84 is just the probability of choosing one out of @xmath3 vertices on the tree , and @xmath85 is the probability that we choose a vertex in the distance @xmath83 from the root . dividing @xmath81 by @xmath3",
    "we obtain the probability that a randomly chosen node is at distance @xmath62 to the root : @xmath86 multiplying eq .",
    "( [ eq : nrec ] ) by @xmath87 and summing over @xmath62 we can calculate moments @xmath88 of this probability distribution . in particular , the first two moments read : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the harmonic number . because @xmath91 for large @xmath3 , the mean distance @xmath92 behaves as @xmath76",
    "but the dispersion @xmath93 grows also logarithmically .",
    "so if one introduced a scaling variable @xmath79 , one would have in the limit @xmath94 : @xmath95 and @xmath96 , so it is not a good scaling variable .",
    "actually , one can solve the recursion relation ( [ eq : nrec ] ) using a generating function formalism .",
    "one obtains in the limit @xmath94 : @xmath97,\\ ] ] where , as mentioned before , both @xmath98 and @xmath99 grow logarithmically .",
    "the function @xmath100 is closely related to @xmath67 , the two - point function we introduced before . for large growing trees",
    ", @xmath100 becomes almost identical to @xmath67 , because in almost all cases if one randomly chooses a pair of vertices , the shortest path between them goes through the root . only if the two lie on the same branch , the shortest path does not contain the root , but the probability that they are on the same branch vanishes for @xmath101 .",
    "thus for large tree the difference between @xmath67 and @xmath100 is in the proportionality factor in the average distance : @xmath102 .",
    "to summarize , the two point function behaves in a completely different way for causal and homogenous trees .",
    "also the other statistical characteristics of the causal trees are different from those for the homogeneous trees . for instance",
    "one can determine the node degree distribution averaged over trees in the ensemble : @xmath103 here @xmath104 is the degree of node @xmath51 , the sum runs over all nodes of the tree , and the average is over all trees in the ensemble . if one calculates this distribution for the homogeneous trees one obtains : @xmath105 while for causal trees : @xmath106 again we see the difference between the set of all labeled trees and the subset of causally labeled trees .",
    "so far we have discussed the ensembles of unweighted graphs : each labeled graph has had a statistical weight equal to @xmath11 independently of its shape .",
    "one can easily extend those considerations to the ensembles of weighted graphs , in particular to an ensemble of graphs for which the statistical weight includes a factor depending on node degrees .",
    "for instance , one can analytically solve a model of trees ( both causal and homogeneous ) whose statistical weight is a product of weights depending on individual node degrees .",
    "for each node one introduces a weight which is a function of the number of edges emerging from it . by tuning the weights one can obtain trees with a desired degree distribution .",
    "however , the following question arises : assume that we have two ensembles of trees with the same node degree distribution .",
    "in the first ensemble we have all labeled trees and in the second only causally labeled ones .",
    "we now remove labels from the trees .",
    "all we have is the graph topology .",
    "can we distinguish whether a given graph topology comes from homogeneous or causal graph ensemble ?",
    "one can answer this question in the affirmative .",
    "let us sketch the solution .",
    "we will generate scale - free tree graphs by tuning the nodes weights . introducing this to the model",
    ", one has to modify the right - hand side of the self - consistency equations .",
    "the exponential series which we used before in equations and to generate equally weighted trees has to be substituted by : @xmath107 here @xmath16 is the node weight which depend only on node s degree @xmath108 .",
    "it can be also interpreted as branching ratio that a link will split into @xmath109 links . in the previous case the weights @xmath110 were identical for all @xmath108 s . in order to produce scale - free networks with the barabsi - albert distribution :",
    "@xmath111 one has to choose @xmath112 for causal trees and @xmath113 for homogeneous trees . in the limit of @xmath114",
    "these two ensembles have identical node - degree distributions @xmath115 . to illustrate this we show in figure [ fig4 ] node degree distributions obtained by monte - carlo simulations of causal and homogeneous trees with the appropriately chosen branching weights .",
    "one can see that they perfectly follow the distribution .",

    "we have considered four ensembles of trees : ( a ) homogeneous uniformly weighted , ( b ) causal uniformly weighted , ( c ) homogeneous with the ba scale - free distribution , ( d ) causal weighted with the ba scale - free distribution .",
    "the average distance between nodes in a scale - free system is generally smaller than in a random one : so graphs in the ensemble ( c ) have on average smaller diameter than in ( a ) and in ( b ) than in ( d ) .",
    "this effect is well known .",
    "it is related to the presence of nodes with high degree which cluster around themselves many vertices just in distance one .",
    "another effect which is less known is that the causality lowers the distances between nodes on the graph .",
    "the effect caused by causality is even stronger than by scale - free tails : the graphs in ( b ) have diameter much smaller than those in ( a ) , and similarly those in ( c ) than those in ( d ) .",
    "one observes big changes if one imposes the causality constraint .",
    "the reason why causality plays such an important role in enhancing the small world effect is related to the fact that the oldest vertices , in addition to having highest degrees , cluster with each other forming a kernel of the graph with extremely high connectivity .",
    "remaining nodes tidily surround this compact kernel making the whole graph structure jampacked . in figure [ fig6 ]",
    "we compare the distance distribution @xmath116 for the cases ( a ) , ( c ) and ( d ) for the same system size .",

    "statistical ensemble of causal trees discussed in the previous section is for the weights @xmath149 @xcite equivalent to an ensemble of trees obtained by a growth process with the linear attachment kernel @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "the map between these models is mathematically exact . for non - linear kernels",
    "the two models slightly differ but both display the same features . if one applies a superlinear attachment kernel in the growth process : @xmath150 for @xmath151 one sees the appearance of a singular node which has the degree proportional to the size of the tree .",
    "if one applies a sublinear kernel @xmath152 , the degree distribution will be suppressed exponentially for large @xmath108 .",
    "the linear kernel is marginal in the sense that it lies exactly between the phase with the singular node and the exponential tail .",
    "a very similar situation takes place for homogeneous trees but the mechanism of the emergence of the singular node is different . the model can be mapped onto a balls - in - boxes model @xcite . in order to obtain scale - free trees one has to choose appropriate vertex weights of the model . any deviation from the fine - tuned values results in either the appearance of the singular node or the exponential suppression in the node degree distribution , exactly as for growing networks . roughly speaking ,",
    "if we denote the fine - tuned scale - free distribution @xmath153 ( the second case in the equation below ) we have three possible scenarios : @xmath154 in the first case the typical fluctuations of the node degree are of order @xmath155 independently of @xmath3 . in the third case there is a singular node with an extensive number of links @xmath156 .",
    "this is equivalent to the backgammon condensation of the balls - in - boxes model @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the singular node makes the system to be even more compact than for scale - free graphs .",
    "the distance between nodes increases slower than logarithmically since many vertices are in the closest neighborhood of the singular node . in the extreme case which corresponds to the star topology",
    " a vertex surrounded by @xmath20 vertices  the average distance is smaller than two and is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "is the condensation a feature of the tree graph ensemble , or it is observed for ensembles of graphs as well ? we have studied this question for homogeneous scale - free graphs and pseudographs . in our conventions graphs do not have multiple- and self - connecting edges while pseudographs do . for graphs ,",
    "the condition that they have neither multiple- nor self - connections acts as strong constraints on the graph structure which are sometimes called structural constraints @xcite .",
    "in particular they strongly prevent the system from developing a power - law tail in the node - degree distribution for finite size systems @xcite .",
    "it also turns out they prohibit the condensation which we discussed above .",
    "so far we have not found any evidence for the backgammon condensation for graphs and the emergence of singular node on the graph . on the contrary , for pseudographs",
    "the situation is very much like for trees and one observes the condensation .",
    "we simulated a canonical ensemble of homogeneous pseudographs with @xmath4 links and @xmath3 vertices , with the distribution @xmath157 .",
    "this was achieved by tuning the node degree weights , similarly as we have described for trees before , and by adjusting the ratio @xmath158 by choosing @xmath159 to the mean value of the distribution @xmath160 .",
    "indeed the system produced the desired distribution .",
    "the next step was to check how the system reacts on the change of the number of links .",
    "we had increased the number of links @xmath4 while keeping the number of nodes @xmath3 constant so that the ratio @xmath161 exceeded @xmath162 .",
    "the system reacted as follows .",
    "the distribution of the bulk part was as before equal to the desired power - law distribution @xmath157 but the system additionally produced a singular node which took the surplus of links .",
    "the presence of the singular node is manifested as a peak in the distribution .",
    "the position of the peak moves linearly with the system size and the peak departs from the main body of the distribution .",
    "its height is proportional to @xmath84 since it is a probability of picking up one out of @xmath3 vertices .",
    "the situation is depicted in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "this is an example of the backgammon condensation @xcite .",
    "if one adds more links , then the surplus will go to the singular node .",
    "one can see this effect by comparison of the plots in the left- and right - hand side of figure [ fig8 ] which differ by the ratio @xmath163 and the positions of the peak correspondingly .",
    "left : the node degree distribution for scale - free pseudographs with @xmath164 which is above the condensation threshold @xmath165 of the ba distribution .",
    "the main part of the distribution goes along the limiting ba curve ( solid line ) .",
    "the peak represents the singular vertex .",
    "its position moves linearly with the system size @xmath166 .",
    "right : the same for larger link density : @xmath167.,title=\"fig : \" ]   left : the node degree distribution for scale - free pseudographs with @xmath164 which is above the condensation threshold @xmath165 of the ba distribution .",
    "the main part of the distribution goes along the limiting ba curve ( solid line ) .",
    "the peak represents the singular vertex .",
    "its position moves linearly with the system size @xmath166 .",
    "right : the same for larger link density : @xmath167.,title=\"fig : \" ]    if one chooses the ratio @xmath163 to be smaller than @xmath168 the system generates an exponential tail in the node degree distribution .",
    "this is again what one expects from the balls - in - boxes model .",
    "the reason why this analogy works for pseudographs and does not for graphs is that for pseudographs the degrees of individual vertices are almost independent of each other except of the global constraint @xmath169 , while they are in a subtle way correlated for graphs due to the structural constraints .",
    "we have applied methods of statistical mechanics to compare ensembles of homogeneous and causal ( growing ) networks .",
    "we have shown that the causality strengthens the small world effect due to clustering of nodes with high connectivity in the kernel of the graph .",
    "in particular , for homogeneous random trees the average inter - node distance scales as @xmath77 while for causal networks as @xmath76 .",
    "we have compared two ensembles of random trees with barabsi - albert distribution and observed that despite they have identical degree distribution , the causal trees have much smaller diameter than the corresponding homogeneous trees .",
    "we have also discussed the stability of the scale - free distributions . for growing network",
    "such distributions emerge for linear attachments kernels . if the attachment is slightly perturbed the system either exponentially suppresses nodes with higher degree or develops a singular node with a degree proportional to the total number of links .",
    "the first type of perturbation corresponds to sublinear while the second to superlinear kernels .",
    "similar instabilities are observed for homogeneous pseudographs .",
    "scale - free distributions require a fine - tuning of the weight parameters .",
    "a slight perturbation , as before , also leads either to the exponential suppression or to the emergence of a singular node on the graph . in this case",
    "the singular node emerges as a result of a condensation of the backgammon type @xcite .",
    "this is essentially a review paper .",
    "most of the results presented above were obtained by the krakow - orsay collaboration , including jerzy jurkiewicz and andr krzywicki .",
    "we wish to thank jerzy and andr for their contribution .",
