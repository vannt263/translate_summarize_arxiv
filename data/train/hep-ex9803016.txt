    "investigation of strange hadron formation at @xmath9 and @xmath10 interactions is of a great interest by several reasons . on the one hand , as in any other hadron - hadron collisions , the particles with nonzero strangeness can be formed only as a result of sea @xmath11 quarks production and of their subsequent hadronisation under condition of open strangeness .",
    "the study of such conditions gives the information on peculiarities of @xmath12-pair formation and of their hadronisation mechanism .",
    "on the other hand , availability of various data on strange particle formation permits to carry out comparative analysis of nonzero strangeness hadrons formation peculiarities at @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath9 interactions @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "this allows to investigate the excess mechanism of strange mesons and barions formation at @xmath9 collisions in comparison with @xmath14 interactions .",
    "the comparison of neutral strange particle formation gives evidence concerning the statement about @xmath14 and nonannihilated @xmath9 interactions equivalence [ 4 ] .",
    "the main contribution to the formation of new heavy quarks at ( @xmath16 ) intermediate energies should give the light valence quarks and antiquarks annihilation subprocesses : @xmath17    the large contribution of valence quarks annihilation to hard subprocesses is established quite reliably .",
    "for example , the yield of @xmath18 particles at @xmath3 @xmath9 interactions exceeds the yield at @xmath14 interactions @xmath19 12 times [ 5,6 ] .",
    "it was shown [ 3,7 ] that at @xmath13 the main excess in the strange particle formation cross section at @xmath9 interactions is connected with @xmath9 annihilation process .",
    "the mesons multiplicity increases with energy in @xmath9 annihilation processes , as at other hadron interactions [ 8 ] , and the valence quarks and antiquarks of initial nucleons can be a part of different secondary mesons .",
    "for production of new @xmath12 pairs at @xmath9 annihilation can be spent a significant part of total energy as compared to @xmath14 interactions .",
    "this is caused by the fact that at @xmath14 interactions part of the total energy ( @xmath19 50 @xmath20 ) is consumed by leading quarks - spectators which , according to existing knowledge , have a week influence on the process of secondary hadrons formation [ 9 ] .",
    "but at @xmath9 annihilation all quarks and antiquarks of initial system can take part in the process of new @xmath12 pair formation . in quark - parton models ,",
    "based on @xmath21 principles , such mechanism of particle production at @xmath9 interactions is realized through annihilation or exchange of more than one @xmath22 pairs . in quark models based on the dual topological unitarization scheme @xmath9 annihilation",
    "is described by `` three - chain '' diagram [ 10 ] in which all three @xmath22 pairs take part in creation of new @xmath23 pairs .",
    "present article deals with the experimental study of the strange @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 particles generation process at @xmath24 interactions .",

    "the @xmath30-pulses of @xmath31 400 kv and @xmath19 @xmath32 duration were produced and shaped by bipolar marx generator and blumlein line [ 13 ] .",
    "the chamber was filled with helium - neon gas mixture @xmath33 at atmospheric pressure .",
    "the memory time of @xmath34 was achieved by a slight admixture of @xmath35 .",
    "the sensitive volume of the chamber was viewed by @xmath36 objectives , each equipped with two - stage image intensifier [ 14 ] .",
    "in addition , the triggered events could be directly controlled by means of television monitor .",
    "the experiment was performed at serpukhov proton synchrotron , using an unseparated beam of negatively charged particles with momentum of @xmath3 .",
    "the beam was composed of @xmath37 and @xmath38 and @xmath39 in @xmath40 ratio and had a momentum spread of @xmath41 .",
    "the nuclear targets were placed in the visible volume of the chamber along the beam line with the spacing of @xmath42 .",
    "the total thickness of all targets corresponded approximately to @xmath43 of the proton absorption length .",
    "the elliptic target disks were mounted inside cylindrical mylar boxes .",
    "a telescope consisting of two scintillation counters located behind the magnet of spectrometre served as a detector designed to single out the events of nonelastic interactions of beam particles in target .",
    "signal of simultaneous starting operation of both counters was switched on for anticoincidence with the signal of incident particles , forming a `` trigger of interaction '' of corresponding particle in the target of spectrometer . on trigger",
    "signal the starting of streamer chamber took place .",
    "the detector excluded the events with negatively charged secondary particles for which the square of transferred 4 momentum equals in average to @xmath44 .",
    "at the same time a great part of the events of elastic scattering was excluded while the losses of non - elastic events were equal to 3 @xmath20 according to the evaluations on the basis of the data of [ 15 ] .",
    "a more detailed description of the detector can be found in [ 16 ] .",
    "about @xmath45 frames of photographic film were scanned , and @xmath46 inelastic @xmath47 interactions with deuterium , lithium , carbon , sulphur , copper and lead nuclei were found . at the scanning stage all secondary two - prong stars @xmath48 ( further refereed to as vees ) were selected . they possibly are originated from the decays of neutral strange particles emitted from the primary interaction vertex . a double scan of the film ensured @xmath19 99 @xmath20 efficiency in detecting the vees .",
    "all tracks associated with the primary vertex , as well as the vertex and the tracks of a vee , were first measured and then geometrically reconstructed in the chamber volume .",
    "events were retained for further analysis if :    ( a ) .",

    "( the mean uncertainty in the noncoplanarity angle is @xmath53 ) .",
    "vees rejected according to this criterion are mostly due to two - prong inelastic interaction or three - body decays of neutral particles .",
    "a vee passing the above coplanarity selection was then kinematically fitted to each of four hypotheses ( @xmath54 ) by the method of least squares for three degrees of freedom @xmath55 . to resolve the @xmath48/@xmath56- ambiguity ,",

    "; but @xmath132 remains constant within the error .",
    "the average magnitudes of @xmath5 and @xmath6 yields are equal both on hydrogen and on deuterium [ 3,17 ] , as far as the c - symmetry at @xmath128 interactions assumes the equality of probabilities of @xmath5 and @xmath6 hyperons generation in events with identical multiplicity .    the @xmath133-dependencies of yields of @xmath134 mesons and @xmath5 and @xmath6 hyperons generated by reactions @xmath135 are shown in fig.@xmath136 .",

    "more rapid fall of @xmath159 is observed as compared to @xmath160 .",
    "the obtained results were compared with those on @xmath7 based on quark - gluon - string model [ 11 ] .",
    "the universality of strings hadronisation is assumed in this model .",
    "this means the identity of multiple processes , taking place at inelastic @xmath14 and nonannihilation @xmath161 interactions , since the processes of annihilation and diffraction are absent in lund model .",
    "the model describes a wide sphere of phenomena from formation of charmed and beauty particles and effects of the fine gluons in hard processes to production of particles in soft interactions of hadrons with nucleons and nuclei [ 22 - 24 ] .    in @xmath7 ( version [ 25,26 ] )",
    "based on lund model for soft hadron - hadron collisions the longitudinally - excited state is formed , i.e. the string between valence quarks ( antiquarks ) and diquarks ( antidiquarks ) of each hadron is stretched . the string is fragmented into hadrons by breakage . in the case of hadron - nuclear interaction projectile hadron interacts more than once and obtained objects in excited states collide with nucleons before they passing through nucleus . since the hadron fragmentation time is more than the internucleonic distance the string stretched by projectile particle does not have a time for fragmentation and continues to interact with nucleons of nucleus . as a result",
    "we have some number of strings fragmented into hadrons outside the nuclei .",
    "the comparison of present experimental results with @xmath7 calculations shows a small difference in the neutral strange particle yields .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that @xmath161 annihilation is not taken into account in the model .    in experiments on heavy nuclei",
    "the value of @xmath162 yield should be even more and the value of @xmath163 yield should be approximately the same as in calculations since the probability of annihilation increases with increasing the atomic number [ 21,27 ] .",
    "thus , the experimental results can be interpreted as follows : some differences in yields of @xmath4 mesons between the model and the experimental data is the consequence of the existence of annihilation channel at @xmath164 interactions . at the same time , a part of @xmath4 mesons ( produced basically in annihilation channel ) has time for secondary interactions in nucleus .",
    "this leads to the increase of @xmath5 hyperon yield , as the threshold energy of @xmath165 production is @xmath166 [ 28 ] .",
    "the experiment shows that @xmath6 hyperon yield , as was mentioned above , is practically independent of the atomic number , though the model predicts their small increase . within the error",
    "their yield is equal to that of @xmath5 hyperons for hydrogen and deuterium , and coincides with model prediction .",
    "this can be explained as follows :    the probability of annihilation processes increases with increasing the atomic number .",
    "but , on the one hand , this does not give the contribution to production of @xmath6 hyperons .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath4 mesons , produced in annihilation channel , can not create @xmath6 hyperons because of large threshold energy ( @xmath167 [ 28 ] ) .",
    "the problems connected with other characteristics of @xmath164 interactions with production of neutral @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 particles will be considered in further publications .",
    "namely , the associated multiplicities of nucleons and negative mesons to the neutral strange particles ; the inclusive characteristics of neutral strange particles and their dependencies on mass number of target nuclei will be investigated .",
    "in the present article we have investigated the production of neutral strange particles in the processes of @xmath164 collisions at incident @xmath3 momentum in wide range of nuclear targets @xmath168 .",
    "the yields of @xmath4 mesons and @xmath5 and @xmath6 hyperons have been defined in dependence on mass number of nuclei in reactions @xmath135 .",
    "the experimental results have been compared with theoretical predictions based on @xmath7 code .",

    "the yield of @xmath6 hyperons in process @xmath98 remains constant within experimental error @xmath171 .",
    "thus the relative yields @xmath172 and @xmath173 , where @xmath148 is the effective number of interactions in nuclear .    \\4 .",
    "experimental values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 particles yield slightly exceed the similar value predicted by @xmath7 code , but their @xmath133 dependencies coincide within the error .",
