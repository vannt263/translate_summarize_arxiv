    "this problem has received increased attention recently , following the development of mean - field theories   as well as of powerful combinatorial algorithms   for its numerical study  . as a result of these efforts ,",
    "a deeper understanding of the rigidity transition has emerged , although some open questions remain .",
    "bethe lattice calculations for rp  @xcite with an adjustable number @xmath2 of degrees of freedom at each site have been used to obtain the behavior of the spanning cluster density @xmath3 as a function of @xmath4 , the dilution ( bond or site ) parameter . for @xmath5 one",
    "has usual ( scalar ) percolation , displaying a continuous transition with @xmath6 .",
    "but for any @xmath7 , the order parameter @xmath8 has a discontinuity at a finite critical value @xmath1 .",
    "thus the rigidity transition is discontinuous for @xmath9@xcite .",
    "other mf approximations also predict a first - order rp transition  @xcite    on triangular lattices on the other hand , there is a divergent correlation length and the rp transition is _ second order _",
    "@xcite , but in a different universality class than usual percolation  @xcite .",
    "some of the numerical evidence in 2d is consistent with a small discontinuity in the order parameter @xmath8 , or a very small value for @xmath10 , but the precise interpretation of this evidence is still a matter of debate  @xcite . in three dimensions",
    "the rigidity transition is undoubtedly second - order  @xcite .",
    "it is at present unclear in which fashion the rp transition becomes discontinuous as the dimensionality increases .",
    "is there something like an upper critical dimension for rp , beyond which it is first - order ? or does it get increasingly `` first - order '' ( i.e. @xmath11 ) as @xmath12 ? this analysis is further complicated by the fact that the character of the transition is _ lattice _ dependent .",
    "hypercubic lattices in which sites have @xmath13 degrees of freedom each can not be rigid if they are diluted , but are rigid if undiluted and if they have appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "thus on hypercubic lattices the rp transition is `` trivially first - order '' at @xmath14 , in any dimension .",
    "similar considerations apply to directed lattices .",
    "bethe lattices are directed by construction , since there is only one path between any two given sites . on directed lattices ,",
    "rigid connectivity takes a particularly simple form .",
    "imagine a rigid boundary to which a site with @xmath2 degrees of freedom must be rigidly attached by means of rotatable springs ( central forces ) .",
    "each spring , or bond , restricts one degree of freedom .",
    "thus the minimum number of bonds required to completely fix this site is @xmath2 .",
    "propagation of rigidity on directed lattices is then defined in the following terms : a site ( with @xmath2 degrees of freedom ) at `` time '' @xmath15 is rigidly connected to a boundary at @xmath16 if and only if it has @xmath2 or more neighbors at _ earlier _ times who in turn are rigidly connected to the boundary .",
    "thus , in contrast to _ undirected _ rigidity , which requires complex algorithms   that presently limit the maximum sizes to approximately @xmath17 sites  @xcite , directed rigidity percolation ( drp ) can be studied by means of a simple numerical procedure , and on much larger systems .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , on any _ directed _ lattice , rigidity percolation is equivalent to _ bootstrap percolation _",
    "( bp ) , a modified percolation problem in which a site belongs to a cluster if at least @xmath18 of its neighbors also do  .",
    "bootstrap percolation on undirected lattices attempts to describe certain systems in which atoms behave magnetically only if they are surrounded by a `` large enough '' number of magnetic neighbors .",
    "a second reason for interest in bp is the search for novel critical behaviors in percolation  @xcite , but the present understanding of this problem indicates that bp is either `` trivially first - order '' with @xmath14 or second - order and in the universality class of scalar percolation  @xcite .",
    "early studies of semi - directed @xmath19 bp on square lattices seemed to indicate a transition at a non - trivial @xmath4  @xcite , but rigorous arguments  @xcite later showed that @xmath14 in this case . to our knowledge",
    "there are no published studies of directed bootstrap percolation ( dbp ) displaying a second - order transition .",
    "it has been recently conjectured  @xcite that any continuous transition in a nonequilibrium process with a scalar order - parameter , and a non - fluctuating , non - degenerate absorbing state must be in the same universality class as directed percolation(dp )  . according to this ,",
    "drp - dbp would belong to the dp universality class in all dimensions for which it has a continuous transition .",
    "it is thus interesting to study rp on finite - dimensional directed lattices of increasing dimensionality , both to test this conjecture and to understand in which fashion drp becomes discontinuous as @xmath12 . in this article",
    "we report on our results for directed rigidity percolation ( drp , equivalent to dbp ) on several ( 1@xmath201)-dimensional lattices displaying first- and second - order phase transitions .",
    "* a*-0.3cm-0.3cm-0.3 cm    0.5 cm    if the drp transition is second - order , we pay particular attention to the determination of critical indices associated with the spreading of rigidity , as described in the following  @xcite . as usual in the study of directed processes , we define @xmath21 to be the asymptotic density of `` active '' ( rigid ) sites , which is equivalent to the probability @xmath22 that , at large times @xmath15 , a randomly chosen point be rigidly connected to a totally rigid boundary at @xmath16 .",
    "if the dilution parameter @xmath4 is lower than a critical value @xmath1 , rigidity does not propagate and @xmath23 .",
    "if the transition is second - order , immediately above @xmath1 one has @xmath24 .",
    "if the evolution starts from a _",
    "finite _ rigid cluster or `` seed '' at @xmath16 instead of a rigid boundary , one defines @xmath25 as the probability that the cluster grown from this seed still be `` active '' at time @xmath15 .",
    "if the transition is second - order , @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 . at @xmath1",
    "this quantity decays as @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 the temporal ( or parallel ) _ correlation length _ exponent : @xmath32 of a cluster grown from a finite seed at @xmath1 behaves as @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the critical index associated with the decay length @xmath36 of perpendicular or `` space '' correlations : @xmath37 .",
    "averages are taken only over clusters still alive at time @xmath15 .",
    "finally , the average mass of a cluster grown from a finite seed at @xmath1 behaves as @xmath38 where @xmath39  @xcite .    for comparison",
    "we also simulate numerically usual directed percolation ( dp , which corresponds to @xmath5 ) . in the dp case",
    "a simple argument shows that @xmath40 because of time - reversal symmetry : consider for simplicity bond dilution and choose an arbitrary point @xmath41 at time @xmath15 . any configuration of occupied bonds connecting @xmath42 to the boundary at @xmath16 , and thus contributing to @xmath43 , when reflected in the time direction , contributes to @xmath25 if now a point - like seed is located at @xmath41 .",
    "since both the original and the time - inverted configuration have the same probability , @xmath44 exactly for bond - diluted dp and therefore @xmath40 .",
    "notice that this equality implies @xmath45 .",
    "* a*-0.3 cm -0.3 cm -0.3 cm    0.5 cm    although no such time - reversal symmetry exists for drp , we find that @xmath40 also in this case .",
    "furthermore we find that drp belongs to the dp universality class , i.e. has exactly the same critical indices .",
    "thus , there is no separate universality class for directed rigidity percolation as there is for _ undirected _ rigidity percolation .",
    "this is consistent with a recent conjecture  @xcite according to which any nonequilibrium process with a single absorbing state will belong to the same universality class as dp .",
    "we also studied the surface critical behavior   of drp , by means of simulations in the presence of an absorbing boundary . in the dp case ,",
    "the presence of the absorbing wall is known to only modify the survival exponent @xmath46 .",
    "we find that this is also the case for drp , and the new exponent is also consistent with the one obtained for dp with a wall .    in section  [ sec :",
    "simulations ] we present our numerical results for drp on directed lattices , with and without absorbing walls , and estimate the relevant critical indices associated to the second - order transitions .",
    "section  [ sec : triangular ] describes drp on a directed triangular lattice .",
    "this case has a first - order transition at @xmath0 , and can be solved exactly for @xmath47 .",
    "in order to simulate drp we store a binary variable per site , indicating whether the given site is or not rigidly connected to the boundary at @xmath16 .",
    "we use the by now standard techniques of multispin - coding ( msc )  @xcite , which allow us to store 64 binary variables in an integer word , and also to update all of them simultaneously .",
    "since interactions are short - ranged in the time direction , we only need to keep in memory a maximum of three consecutive lines of the system and we do this by means of three linear arrays which are reused periodically .    we have considered three different oriented lattices : square , triangular and 5n - lattice ( see later ) .",
    "the first two of them display trivial behavior ( i.e. rigid only at @xmath0 ) and the third one presents a continuous drp transition at a non - trivial @xmath1 . in the first place we discuss drp on a square lattice as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : latexample]a .",
    "each site at time @xmath15 has two neighbors at time @xmath48 .",
    "this is the minimum number of neighbors needed for rigidity with @xmath49 and thus any amount of dilution is enough to impede propagation of rigidity .",
    "therefore square lattices are not rigid at any @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath0 , rigidity propagates only if boundary conditions are appropriate ( e.g. rigid , or periodic , but not open ) .",
    "any finite rigid cluster of size @xmath51 shrinks to zero in @xmath51 time - steps , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : finiteclusters]a .",
    "the same would happen on directed @xmath13-dimensional hypercubic lattices if @xmath52 .",
    "we next consider the triangular lattice , oriented as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : latexample]b .",
    "each site has three neighbors at earlier times . despite the number of neighbors being larger than the minimum required ( two ) ,",
    "this lattice is also unable to propagate rigidity if diluted by any amount . to see why this is so ,",
    "consider fig .",
    "[ fig : finiteclusters]b , where one starts from a finite cluster of rigid sites ( black sites ) at @xmath16 .",
    "if the lattice is undiluted ( @xmath0 ) , this cluster would just propagate unchanged in `` time '' .",
    "if the lattice is diluted by any amount , this rigid cluster would gradually shrink and eventually disappear .",
    "thus for this lattice @xmath14 , the same as for the square lattice .",
    "in contrast , finite - size effects are expected to be quite strong on the triangular lattice , since the lifetime of a finite rigid cluster diverges as @xmath53 , no matter its original size .",
    "also boundary effects are different since now propagation of rigidity can exist without periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we discuss this case in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : triangular ] .",
    "in order to have a nontrivial @xmath1 for drp , we use triangular lattices augmented with two further bonds per site .",
    "these extra bonds connect layers @xmath15 and @xmath54 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : latexample]c .",
    "this makes a total of five neighbors per site and we call this the 5n - lattice for simplicity .",
    "now consider what happens when starting from a finite cluster of rigid sites on an undiluted 5n - lattice .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : finiteclusters]c , the size of the rigid cluster _ expands _ in time with a constant angle if @xmath0 .",
    "thus there will be a nontrivial value @xmath1 , above which rigidity propagates forever .",
    "we find that the drp transition is second - order on this lattice . for comparison",
    "we also simulate dp on the square lattice .",
    "we next discuss our numerical results for drp on the 5n - lattice , and compare them to dp on the square lattice .",
    "we typically start our simulations from a finite seed of contiguous rigid sites and let the system evolve for @xmath55 timesteps ( or until all activity dies out ) and measure the survival probability @xmath56 , cluster width @xmath57 and average mass @xmath58 as a function of time .    0.5 cm    in a first set of simulations we estimate the critical density @xmath1 for drp on site - diluted 5n - lattices , by measuring @xmath59 at different values of @xmath4 and identifying the one for which the asymptotic behavior is closest to a straight line in a log - log plot ( figure [ fig : p_t ] ) . from these data we estimate @xmath60 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath56 , which shows appreciable curvature for off - critical values of @xmath4 , the slopes of the cluster mass @xmath58 and the meandering width @xmath61 in a similar log - log graph show little variation when @xmath62 . for dp on site - diluted square lattices ,",
    "we use the estimate  @xcite @xmath63 .    0.5 cm    figure  [ fig : nowall]a shows @xmath64 for drp ( 5n - lattice ) and dp ( square lattice ) at their respective critical values . assuming power - law corrections to ( [ eq : p - decay ] )",

    "@xmath61 behave as shown in figures [ fig : nowall]b and c respectively . from these data we estimate @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the more precise values  @xcite @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , suggesting that drp and dp are in the same universality class .    in order to further test whether drp has the same critical behavior as dp",
    ", we also studied drp in the presence of an absorbing wall ( drpw ) . for dp with an absorbing wall ( dpw ) it is known   that the survival exponent @xmath46 is replaced by @xmath76 , while @xmath31 and @xmath35 remain unchanged .",
    "therefore only @xmath77 is expected to change due to the presence of the absorbing wall .",
    "our results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : wall ] , and from them we obtain @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . notice that @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 no longer add up to one since @xmath84 and @xmath76 are independent exponents .",
    "these results are entirely consistent with the values obtained for dpw by other authors  @xcite .",
    "this case is marginal as already advanced , since any amount of dilution will destroy rigidity and thus @xmath14 , but on the other hand the lifetime of finite clusters is not finite as on the square lattice , but diverges as @xmath85 . as we show now ,",
    "it is possible to obtain finite - size effects analytically for @xmath86 .    *",

    "we do not need to specify for the moment whether we are dealing with bond or site dilution . for short times all sites",
    "are rigidly connected to the lower boundary , but soon some non - rigid sites , or `` defects '' , will appear in the presence of either bond or site dilution .",
    "the smallest possible defect is a single non - rigid site , which happens with probability @xmath88 per site on site - diluted lattices ( one missing site ) and with probability @xmath89 per site on bond - diluted lattices ( two or three missing bonds ) .",

    "[ fig : defects]a .",
    "all sites directly above these will have only one rigid neighbor and thus fail to be rigid , creating a `` defect wall '' .",

    "if one of these boundary sites fails to be rigid , all sites above it will also not be rigid . in this case",
    "the rigid boundary is displaced by one unit , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : defects]b .",
    "therefore , for small but nonzero @xmath88 , the rigid wall in fig .",
    "[ fig : defects]b moves rightwards with an average velocity @xmath93 which equals the probability for a boundary site to fail to be rigid .",

    "this picture of the rigid - non - rigid transition is related to the polynuclear growth model ( png)@xcite , which has been extensively studied in the area of crystal growth . for our discussion of drp",
    "we only need a few results which can be derived by means of simple arguments .    0.5 cm    assuming one knows the cone angle @xmath94 and the defect density @xmath90 , it is easy to calculate the density of rigid points @xmath43 after @xmath15 timesteps on a system of infinite width .",
    "a point @xmath42 will be rigidly connected to the rigid boundary located at @xmath16 if it has not suffered the effect of any defect . in other words , if no defect has nucleated inside a `` cone '' with downwards opening angle @xmath95 and whose vertex sits at @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath96 be the area of this cone .",
    "since defects nucleate randomly in space - time with density @xmath90 , their number inside any given area @xmath97 is a poisson - distributed random variable with average @xmath98 .",
