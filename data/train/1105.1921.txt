    "in this paper we investigate the time dependent schrdinger - newton equation ( henceforth abbreviated sn - equation ) : @xmath1 it can be thought of as ordinary time - dependent schrdinger equation , @xmath2 with a newtonian gravitational potential @xmath3 sourced by a mass distribution associated to @xmath4 itself , that is @xmath5 , so that @xmath6 the re - coupling of @xmath4 via ( [ eq : newton ] ) into ( [ eq : schroedinger ] ) results in the non - linear and non - local self - interaction seen in ( [ eq : schroedingernewton ] ) .",
    "physical intuition suggests this self - interaction to cause a slow down of dispersion which should be the more pronounced the higher the value of @xmath7 is chosen .    in @xcite",
    "it was surprisingly found on the basis of numerical computations that gaussian wave packets of width @xmath8 start shrinking in width if the mass parameter exceeds @xmath9 .",
    "this is surprising in view of the fact that simple analytical estimates suggest this type of behaviour to occur much later , namely at the said initial width for mass values between around @xmath0 .",
    "the authors of @xcite observed this discrepancy and encouraged a check of their results , which we performed .",
    "the result is , that our numerical studies now fully confirm the high mass values so that no discrepancy between numerical and simple analytical estimates seem to occur .",
    "the special attention to typical width dimension of @xmath8 stems from actual molecular interferometry experiments in which the wave nature of complex molecules has been demonstrated ; see , e.g. , @xcite for an overview .",
    "the molecules used in @xcite were tetraphenylporphyrin @xmath10 with mass @xmath11 and the more complex and more massive fluorofullerene @xmath12 composed of 108 atoms and of total mass @xmath13 .",
    "the grating period and grating thickness were about @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .    for further discussion",
    ", we now collect some background material concerning the sn - equation  ( [ eq : schroedingernewton ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : schroedingernewton ] ) can be derived from the following action ( we write @xmath16 instead of @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the complex conjugate of @xmath4 ) : @xmath19=\\int { \\mathrm{d}}t \\biggl\\{&\\frac{i\\hbar}{2}\\int { \\mathrm{d}}^3x \\bigl(\\psi^*(t,\\vec x)\\dot\\psi(t,\\vec x ) -\\psi(t,\\vec x){\\dot\\psi}^*(t,\\vec x)\\bigr)\\nonumber\\\\ -\\,&\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\int { \\mathrm{d}}^3x \\bigl(\\vec\\nabla\\psi(t,\\vec x)\\bigr)\\cdot \\bigl(\\vec\\nabla\\psi^*(t,\\vec x)\\bigr)\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : nonlocalactionforsn } + \\,&\\frac{gm^2}{2}\\iint { \\mathrm{d}}^3x\\,{\\mathrm{d}}^3y\\ , \\frac{\\vert\\psi(t,\\vec x)\\vert^2\\,\\vert\\psi(t,\\vec y)\\vert^2}{\\vert\\vec x-\\vec y\\vert } \\biggr\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath4 and @xmath18 are to be varied independently .",

    "inserting the solution @xmath21 into ( [ eq : localactionforsn ] ) then leads to ( [ eq : nonlocalactionforsn ] ) .",
    "we usually restrict attention to solutions which are square integrable over space , so that solutions of the time dependent sn - equations are paths in the hilbert space @xmath22 .",
    "we shall see below that time evolution preserves the norm ( this follows from the symmetry under phase transformations ) .",
    "symmetries of ( [ eq : schroedingernewton ] ) are :    1 .",
    "constant phase shifts @xmath23 with constant @xmath24 .",
    "this symmetry of the equation of motion is also a symmetry of the action ( [ eq : nonlocalactionforsn ] ) . hence there is a conserved noether current which turns out to be just the same functional of @xmath4 as in ordinary schrdinger theory . in particular",
    ", the space integral over @xmath25 is time independent .",
    "2 .   proper orthochroneous galilei transformations @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes spatial rotations , @xmath28 boost transformations , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 space and time translations respectively , and where @xmath31 collectively stands for @xmath32 . these generate the inhomogeneous ( proper orthochronous ) galilei group which acts via proper ray - representations on wave functions as follows : @xmath33 note that except for the phase @xmath34 , this is just the transformation of a scalar function on spacetime under the diffeomorphism @xmath35 .",

    "a convenient choice is ( compare  @xcite ) @xmath37\\,.\\ ] ] it is immediate that the self - interaction term in ( [ eq : schroedingernewton ] ) and ( [ eq : nonlocalactionforsn ] ) does not affect galilei invariance of the equation of motion .",
    "moreover , ( [ eq : galileitrans-2 ] ) is also a symmetry of the action so that 10 conserved quantities result .",
    "the expressions for total momentum and angular momentum are again the same functionals of @xmath4 as in ordinary schrdinger theory , but that for total energy will clearly include the non - linear interaction .",
    "3 .   whereas the proper orthochroneous galilei transformations exclude space and time inversions , the latter are also symmetries of the sn - equation . to define them ,",
    "let @xmath38 and @xmath39 be the following diffeomorphisms of @xmath40 : + [ eq : defreflectiondiffeos ] @xmath41 + the unitary transformations of space inversion and the anti - unitary transformation of time inversion ( or better `` reversal of motion '' ) on wavefunctions is then defined by + [ eq : defreflectiontrans ] @xmath42 + where @xmath43 denotes complex - conjugation .",
    "it is easy to check that if @xmath4 solves the sn - equation then @xmath44 and @xmath45 also solve it .",
    "4 .   there is a scaling equivariance between sn - equations of different mass parameters @xmath7 .",
    "the precise statement is this : let @xmath46 be the multiplicative group of positive real numbers .",
    "it acts by scaling transformations on spacetime : @xmath47 where @xmath48 are real numbers characterising the action .",
    "it also acts on the complex numbers : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is yet another real number .",
    "now , since the group acts on @xmath40 ( via @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 ( via @xmath53 ) it also acts on @xmath54 ( via @xmath55 ) and hence on graphs of functions @xmath56 .",
    "the transform of a function ( via @xmath57 ) is then defined to be the function uniqueley corresponding to the transformed graph : @xmath58 where in the last step we just used that each @xmath59 is a bijection .",
    "hence @xmath60 or , in simpler terms , @xmath61 as already mentioned , we wish to consider normalised wave functions .",
    "the scaling ( [ eq : scalingactionfunctions-1 ] ) preserves normalisation iff @xmath62 , i.e. iff @xmath63 .",
    "solutions to the sn - equation for all positive mass parameters @xmath7 then correspond to special paths on the unit sphere in hilbert space .",
    "we ask under what conditions the action ( [ eq : scalingactionfunctions-1 ] ) transforms solutions @xmath4 to the sn - equation for mass parameter @xmath7 to solutions @xmath64 for some mass parameter @xmath65 .",
    "we have + [ eq : scalingtrans ] @xmath66 + where @xmath67 is the potential function @xmath68 denoting the sn - equation symbolically by @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 iff each term scales with the same factor . according to ( [ eq : scalingtrans ] )",
    "this is the case iff @xmath71 i.e. iff @xmath72 first of all this means that @xmath65 is a power of @xmath73 times @xmath7 .",
    "this power may without loss of generality be taken to unity , for if @xmath74 were equal to @xmath75 we could take @xmath76 as new and equally good scaling parameter and everythig that follows were true for @xmath77 instead of @xmath73 .",
    "so from @xmath78 we see from ( [ eq : snsymm-3 ] ) that @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and hence @xmath81 . to sum up",
    ", we have shown that @xmath82 satisfies the sn - equation for mass @xmath83 if @xmath4 satisfies the sn - equation for mass @xmath7 .    the stationary version of ( [ eq : schroedingernewton ] ) is obtained by replacing @xmath84 with the energy @xmath85 .",
    "it has a unique ( up to translations , of course ) spherically symmetric stable ground state . the ground state minimises the energy functional which",
    "is given by the negative of the second and third term in ( [ eq : nonlocalactionforsn ] ) .",
    "existence and uniqueness of the ground state were first shown by lieb  @xcite , albeit motivated in completely different physical context ( one - component plasmas ) in 1976 by choquard .",
    "hence lieb called it the _ choquard equation _ , which is mathematically equivalent to the stationary sn - equation .",
    "numerical studies led to the following value for the ground - state energy to @xmath86 times @xmath87 . ]",
    "@xmath88 where @xmath89 is the planck mass .",
    "a rough intuition for the width , @xmath90 , of the mass distribution @xmath5 in the ground state is obtained by schematically writing the total energy as sum of the kinetic and potential term and replacing the laplacian in the first by @xmath91 and the double integral in the third term of ( [ eq : nonlocalactionforsn ] ) by @xmath92 : @xmath93 minimising in @xmath90 then gives @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the planck length .",
    "the rough energy ( [ eq : roughenergy ] ) at the rough minimum ( [ eq : roughgroundstatediameter ] ) is @xmath96 which compares reasonably with ( [ eq : groundstateenergy ] ) .    clearly , we would not trust the stationary solution in this newtonian picture if the support of the mass distribution @xmath5 had a spatial extent not much larger than @xmath7 s schwarzschild radius @xmath97 .",
    "now , the condition @xmath98 is equivalent to @xmath99 which means that we should not let @xmath7 come too close to the planck mass ( though note the 4th powers ) .",
    "finally we note the dimensionless form of ( [ eq : schroedingernewton ] ) that one obtains by introducing a spatial length scale @xmath100 .",
    "using dimensionless spatial coordinates @xmath101 and a dimensionless time @xmath102 according to @xmath103 and rescaling @xmath104 so as to keep @xmath105 normalised with respect to @xmath106 , we get @xmath107 with dimensionless coupling constant @xmath108 note that the combination @xmath109 which determines the coupling had to be expected from scale invariance  ( [ eq : snsymm-4 ] ) .",
    "we consider now the time - dependent sn - equation for initial values given by a spherically symmetric gaussian wave packet of width @xmath90 : @xmath110 we have then two free parameters , @xmath90 and @xmath7 , and we ask for the regions in this two - parameters space in which significant inhibitions of the usual free dispersion occur .",
    "for simplicity we will refer to such a behaviour as a `` collapse '' , even though it is clear that neither the integal over @xmath111 nor the volume of the support of @xmath111 ( which is infinite ) change .",
    "we start by presenting four different analytical arguments , all of which suggest that a collapse of the wave packet sets in whenever the dimensionless coupling @xmath112 in ( [ eq : dimensionlesscoupling ] ) approaches unity .",
    "let us first give a rough estimate for the critical mass by a nave calculation , in which we demand equilibrium between the acceleration of the peak probability density and the acceleration due to gravitation for a point mass .",
    "the free solution ( without gravitational potential ) for the problem at hand is @xmath113 the radial probability density , @xmath114 , has a global maximum at @xmath115 taking the second time derivative we obtain the peak s acceleration    @xmath116    this we now compare to newton s law for the gravitational acceleration @xmath117 at time @xmath118 . using @xmath119 , we get @xmath120 for @xmath121{\\mu m}$ ] this yields a threshold mass for collapse of about @xmath122{kg}$ ] or @xmath123{u}$ ] .",
    "it was noted by harrison _",
    "_  @xcite that only initial data of negative energy can show inhibitions of dispersion .",
    "this can be used to provide a lower mass bound for collapsing behaviour in a mathematically rigorous way .",
    "the result strongly contradicts the collapse mass found in @xcite .",
    "define the kinetic energy @xmath124 , the potential energy @xmath125 , and the total energy @xmath126 respectively by    @xmath127    the second moment , defined by @xmath128 then has the following second order time derivative : @xmath129 but @xmath3 ( and therefore also @xmath125 ) is everywhere negative due to the maximum principle which means that for positive energy @xmath126 , @xmath130 is a convex function of time .",
    "hence , in terms of the second moment it is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for a collapsing wave packet , that its initial data has negative energy .",
    "we can now easily calculate the energy of the spherically symmetric , real gaussian wave packet .",

    "we consider the ground state of the spherically symmetric sn - equation found by moroz _",
    "_ in  @xcite .",
    "in order to do this we need to rescale the sn - equation in a suitable fashion in order to to compare our form of the equation , which explicitly contains the mass parameter , with the form solved in  @xcite , in which @xmath7 does not appear . in order to understand how to transform solutions of one form into solutions of the other , we use scale invarianvce .    in a first step we substitute @xmath135 into the stationary sn - equation    [ eq : stationary_sn ] @xmath136 \\ , \\psi(\\vec{x})\\,,\\\\ \\delta \\phi(\\vec{x } ) & = 4 \\pi \\ , g \\ , m \\ , { \\vert \\psi(\\vec{x } ) \\vert}^2\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it then takes the following form :    [ eq : stationarysn ] @xmath137    this can be further simplyfied if written in terms of the rescaled function @xmath138 , where @xmath139 .",

    "therefore @xmath145 this means that the rescaling changes the norm of @xmath141 and the following statement holds :    suppose that @xmath146 satisfy .",
    "for a given mass value @xmath7 let @xmath73 be the rescaling parameter for which the norm of @xmath147 is @xmath148 then the wave function defined by @xmath149 is a normalised solution to the stationary sn - equation   with mass parameter @xmath7 .",
    "putting equations   together we obtain a formula that gives us a normalised wave function satisfying the stationary sn - equation ( [ eq : stationarysn ] ) with mass parameter @xmath7 for any unnormalised solution @xmath141 of ( [ eq : sn - equation_for_omega ] ) : @xmath150     found by moroz _",

    "@xmath179     +   +   +    inserting and into  , the final result can now be stated as @xmath180 @xmath181 and @xmath182 are plotted in figure [ fig : plot_ab ] . while @xmath183 shows an attractive behaviour ( i.e. the wave function grows for small values of @xmath184 ) , @xmath185 shows a repulsive behaviour .",
    "thus , the attractive behaviour gets dominant for large masses , as expected .    in figure [ fig : plot_phi ]",
    "the second order derivative of @xmath186 is plotted for several values of the mass @xmath7 .",
    "one can see that there is a repulsive behaviour for @xmath187 which turns with increasing mass and is completely attractive for masses @xmath188 . we therefore expect the collapse of the wave function to happen at about 58 @xmath189 .",
    "our numerical methods do not differ in principle from those used in @xcite .",

    "@xmath207 the wave packet spreads , but slower than the free solution for zero potential spreads .",
    "the larger the mass , the slower the spreading becomes compared to the free solution . + for masses below @xmath208 the difference to the free solution is hardly identifiable . * for masses @xmath209 we observe a collapsing wave packet .",
    "the shrinking behaviour was verified for masses up to @xmath210 .",
    "* we have no results for larger masses , yet , as for reliable results one needs to increase both the temporal and spatial resolution with increasing mass , and therefore the runtime of the calculation also increases .      in figure",
    "[ fig : rp ] we plot the time evolution for the global maximum of the probability density .",
    "the collapsing behaviour for masses not less than @xmath213 is obvious .",
    "also note the oscillations for larger time values which are due to the packet penetrating itself .",
    "there also seems to be some equilibrium distance to which the wave packet collapses , which might correspond to a stationary solution .",
    "the chaotic behaviour for the curve corresponding to @xmath214 is probably due to numeric effects .",
    "we also plot the radius @xmath215 within which 90% of the probability are located , i.e. @xmath216 against time .",
    "one can see from figure [ fig : r90plot ] , where @xmath217 is plotted for a mass of @xmath0 , that it is reasonable to define a collapse time by the minimum of this plot , which then is about 30000 seconds .      while interferometry experiments might still be feasible at masses of order of the collapse mass of @xmath0 that we found ,",
    "another experimental constriction occurs .",
    "as can be seen from figures [ fig : rp ] and [ fig : r90plot ] the time scale beneath which the collapse takes place is of the order of several hours . for experimental tests one would like to take this time scale down to a reasonable value .",
    "hence , we plot in figure [ fig : mass_time ] the time it takes the solution of the full sn - equation to differ from the solution of the free schrdinger equation in its full width at half maximum by a certain percentage against the mass .",
    "figure [ fig : mass_time](a ) shows that the coherence time needed decreases with increasing mass .",
    "according to figure [ fig : mass_time](b ) it takes , for example , about 3 minutes for the solution for @xmath218 to differ from the free solution by one per cent .    consequently on one hand , if keeping the width of the wave packet constant , for an experimental test of the sn - equation by means of e.g. molecular inteferometry one needs to maximise not only the mass but also coherence time and the sensitivity regarding the detection of deviations from the free schrdinger equation .    but note that on the other hand , we also could make use of the scaling law to decrease the collapse time .",
    "if we simultaneously increase the mass by factor of @xmath73 and decrease the width by a factor of @xmath219 the collapse time decreases by a factor of @xmath220 .",
    "thus , for a mass of @xmath221 , for example , observed with a grating period of 0.5 nm one should in principle be able to observe a collapsing wave packet causing a loss of interference with a coherence time of approximately 300ms .",
