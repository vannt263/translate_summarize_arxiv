    "one of the major uncertainties in modern astrophysics is the issue of whether the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is universal or , alternatively , determined by environmental effects .",
    "galactic globular clusters and rich , compact magellanic cloud star clusters are ideal laboratories for providing strong constraints on the universality of the imf , in particular because they are essentially single age , single metallicity systems for which statistically significant samples of individual stars over a range of masses can easily be resolved .    although the standard picture , in which stars in dense clusters evolve rapidly towards a state of energy equipartition through stellar encounters  with the corresponding mass segregation  is generally accepted , observations of various degrees of mass segregation in very young star clusters ( e.g. , de grijs et al .",
    "2002a , b and references therein ) suggest that at least some of this effect is related to the process of star and star cluster formation itself .",
    "the effects of mass segregation in star clusters , with the more massive stars being more centrally concentrated than the lower - mass stars , clearly complicates the interpretation of an observed luminosity function ( lf ) at a given position within a star cluster in terms of its imf . without reliable corrections for the effects of mass segregation , hence for the structure and dynamical evolution of the cluster , it is impossible to obtain a realistic global cluster lf . quantifying the degree of actual mass segregation is thus crucial for the interpretation of observational luminosity and mass functions ( mfs ) in terms of the imf , even for very young star clusters .",
    "the time - scale for the onset of significant dynamical mass segregation is comparable to the cluster s dynamical relaxation time ( spitzer & shull 1975 , inagaki & saslaw 1985 , bonnell & davies 1998 , elson et al .",
    "a cluster s characteristic time - scale may be taken to be its half - mass ( or median ) relaxation time , i.e. , the relaxation time at the mean density for the inner half of the cluster mass for cluster stars with stellar velocity dispersions characteristic for the cluster as a whole ( spitzer & hart 1971 , lightman & shapiro 1978 , meylan 1987 , malumuth & heap 1994 , brandl et al .",
    "1996 ) , and can be written as ( meylan 1987 ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the half - mass ( median ) radius ( in pc ) , @xmath3 the total cluster mass , and @xmath4 the typical mass of a cluster star ( both masses in @xmath5 ) .",
    "although the half - mass relaxation time characterises the dynamical evolution of a cluster as a whole , significant differences are expected locally within the cluster . from eq .",
    "( [ trelax.eq ] ) it follows immediately that the relaxation time - scale will be shorter for higher - mass stars ( greater @xmath4 ) than for their lower - mass companions . from this argument",
    "it follows that dynamical mass segregation will also be most rapid where the local relaxation time is shortest , i.e. , near the cluster centre ( cf .",
    "fischer et al .",
    "1998 , hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) .",
    "the relaxation time in the core can be written as ( meylan 1987 ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the cluster core radius ( in pc ) , @xmath8 ( km s@xmath9 ) the velocity scale , and @xmath10 the mean mass ( in @xmath5 ) of all particles in thermal equilibrium .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that even the concept of a `` local relaxation time '' is only a general approximation , as dynamical evolution is a continuing process . the time - scale for a cluster to lose all traces of its initial conditions",
    "also depends on the smoothness of its gravitational potential , i.e. the number of stars ( bonnell & davies 1998 ) , the degree of equipartition reached ( e.g. , hunter et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the slope of the mf ( e.g. , lightman & shapiro 1978 , inagaki & saslaw 1985 , pryor et al .",
    "1986 , sosin 1997 ) , among others .",
    "in addition , as the more massive stars move inwards towards the cluster centre , their dynamical evolution will speed up .",
    "this process will be accelerated if there is no ( full ) equipartition ( cf .",
    "inagaki & saslaw 1985 ) , thus producing high - density cores very rapidly , where stellar encounters occur very frequently and binary formation is thought to be very effective ( cf .",
    "inagaki & saslaw 1985 , elson et al . 1987 ) .",
    "this may accelerate the mass segregation even more significantly ( e.g. , nemec & harris 1987 , de marchi & paresce 1996 , bonnell & davies 1998 , elson et al .",
    "this process will act on similar ( or slightly shorter ) time - scales as the conventional dynamical mass segregation ( cf .",
    "nemec & harris 1987 , bonnell & davies 1998 , elson et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we obtained f555w and f814w _ hst / wfpc2 _ imaging observations of two young compact lmc clusters , ngc 1805 ( @xmath11 myr ) and ngc 1818 ( @xmath12 myr ) , covering a large range of radii ( see de grijs et al .",
    "2002a for observational details ) .",
    "the radial dependence of the lf and mf slopes indicate clear mass segregation in both clusters at radii @xmath13 ( de grijs et al .",
    "2002a , b ) .    in fig .",
    "1a we show the dependence of the cluster core radius on the adopted magnitude ( mass ) range . for both clusters",
    "we clearly detect the effects of mass segregation for stars with masses @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "stars with masses @xmath16 show a similar concentration , while a trend of increasing core radius with decreasing mass ( increasing magnitude ) is apparent for lower masses .",
    "elson et al .",
    "( 1987 ) estimated the central velocity dispersion in ngc 1818 to be in the range",
    "@xmath17 km s@xmath9 . combining this central velocity dispersion , the core radius of @xmath18 pc ( de grijs et al .",
    "2002a , b ) , and the cluster age of @xmath19 myr , we estimate that the cluster core is between @xmath20 and @xmath21 crossing times old , so that dynamical mass segregation in the core should be well under way .",
    "although we do not have velocity dispersion information for ngc 1805 , it is particularly interesting to extend this analysis to this younger ( @xmath11 myr ) cluster .",
    "we know that its core radius is roughly half that of ngc 1818 ( de grijs et al .",
    "2002a , b ) , and its mass is a factor of @xmath11 smaller .",
    "simple scaling of eq .",
    "( [ trelax.eq ] ) shows then that the half - mass relaxation time of ngc 1805 is @xmath22 as short as that of ngc 1818 ; if we substitute the scaling laws into eq .",
    "( [ tcore.eq ] ) , we estimate that the central velocity dispersion in ngc 1805 is @xmath23 smaller than that in ngc 1818 . from this argument",
    "it follows that the cluster core of ngc 1805 is @xmath24 crossing times old .",
    "however , since strong mass segregation is observed out to @xmath25 and @xmath26 in ngc 1805 and ngc 1818 , respectively , for stellar masses in excess of @xmath27 , it is most likely that significant primordial mass segregation was present in both clusters , particularly in ngc 1805 ( cf . fig .",
    "1b ) .    within the uncertainties",
    ", we can not claim that the slopes of the outer mfs in ngc 1805 and ngc 1818 are significantly different , which therefore implies that these clusters must have had very similar imfs .",
    "in fact , in de grijs et al .",
    "( 2002c ) we extended our study of mass segregation in clusters of various ages to a sample of six rich lmc clusters , selected to include three pairs of clusters of similar age ( roughly @xmath28 and @xmath29 yr old ) , metallicity , and distance from the lmc centre , and exhibiting a large spread in core radii between the clusters in each pair .",
    "the large spread in core radii in any given cluster pair was chosen because the core radius distribution of rich lmc clusters systematically increases in both upper limit and spread with increasing cluster age ( e.g. , mackey & gilmore 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "all clusters show clear evidence of mass segregation : ( i ) their luminosity function slopes steepen with increasing cluster radius , and ( ii ) the brighter stars are characterized by smaller core radii .",
    "_ for all sample clusters",
    "_ , both the slope of the luminosity function in the cluster centres and the degree of mass segregation are similar to each other , within observational errors of a few tenths of power - law slope fits to the data .",
    "this implies that their _ initial _ mass functions must have been very similar , down to @xmath30 ( cf .",
