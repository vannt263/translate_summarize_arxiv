    "understanding the formation and evolution of large scale structure ( hereafter lss ) in the universe is one of the foremost problems in cosmology . in the standard approach to studying lss ,",
    "one starts with a model for the primordial mass density fluctuations , uses analytical approximations or numerical simulations to predict the ensemble averaged statistical properties of galaxy clustering , and compares them with those of the observed galaxy distribution , assuming that we observe fair sample of the universe .",
    "however , we can not expect a simulation started from random initial conditions to reproduce the specific structures observed in a galaxy redshift catalog , even if the _",
    "statistical _ properties of the galaxy clustering are correct .",
    "reconstruction analysis is a complementary approach to the study of lss in which one works backward from the observed galaxy distribution to the initial mass density fluctuations in the same region of space , then evolves these model initial conditions forward in time to the present day using an n - body code .",
    "the reconstruction method incorporates assumptions about the properties of primordial fluctuations , the values of cosmological parameters , and the `` bias '' between the galaxy and mass distributions .",
    "these assumptions can be tested by comparing in detail the evolved reconstruction to the original galaxy redshift data . a by - product of the analysis is a detailed model for the origin and evolution of familiar , well studied structures in the local universe , such as the great attractor , the perseus - pisces supercluster , and the sculptor void .    in this paper , we present the results of reconstruction analysis of the iras point source catalog redshift survey ( hereafter pscz , saunders et al .",
    "1995 ; canavezes et al . 1998 ) , using the `` hybrid '' method described by narayanan & weinberg ( 1998 , hereafter nw98 ) .",
    "first , we create the galaxy density field smoothed with a gaussian filter of radius @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 ) , correct for the effects of bias and redshift - space distortions , and derive the smoothed initial mass density field by tracing the evolution of these density fluctuations backward in time .",
    "we then evolve these initial density fluctuations forward using an n - body code , assuming a value for @xmath1 , and compare in detail the clustering properties of the reconstructed pscz galaxy distribution to those of the input galaxy distribution , either assuming that galaxies trace mass or selecting galaxies from the n - body particle distribution using a biasing prescription . for our purposes , therefore , a model of structure formation consists of a value of @xmath1 , a bias factor @xmath6 that gives the ratio of rms galaxy and mass fluctuations on a scale of @xmath7 , and an explicit biasing scheme that specifies how galaxies are to be selected from the large scale mass distribution .",
    "all of our models assume that structure grew by gravitational instability from gaussian primordial fluctuations  these are the implicit assumptions of the method itself .",
    "we reconstruct the catalog using 15 different models and quantify the accuracy of each using a variety of clustering statistics .",
    "even if the model assumptions are correct , we do not expect to reproduce the observed structure exactly , because we begin with imperfect data and because the method can not invert gravitational evolution in the strongly non - linear regime .",
    "for each statistic , we therefore rank the accuracy of the model s with respect to the reconstructions of ten mock catalogs derived from the outputs of n - body simulations of the model under consideration .",
    "finally , we use these ranks to evaluate the success of the for each model , to constrain @xmath1 , and to test models of bias between the mass and iras galaxy distributions in the real universe .    the hybrid technique ( nw98 ) that we use for our analysis",
    "combines the complementary desirable features of the mapping method ( weinberg 1992 ) , which assumes gaussian primordial fluctuations and a monotonic relation between the smoothed initial mass density field and the smoothed final galaxy density field , and the dynamical methods of nusser & dekel ( 1992 ) and gramann ( 1993a ) , which are based on the momentum and mass conservation equations , respectively , under the approximation that the comoving trajectories of mass particles are straight lines ( the zeldovich [ 1970 ] approximation ) . in the hybrid method",
    ", we first recover the smoothed initial density field from the smoothed final mass density field using a modified form of the dynamical methods , then gaussianize this recovered _ initial _ density field to robustly recover the initial fluctuations even in the non - linear regions ( an approach also used by kolatt et al . 1996 ) .",
    "for a that incorporates biased galaxy formation , we precede the dynamical step with a step that maps the smoothed galaxy density field monotonically to a smoothed mass density field with the theoretically expected ( non - linear , non - gaussian ) pdf . the hybrid method is described and tested in detail in nw98 , who show that it can reconstruct a galaxy redshift survey more accurately than either the method or the dynamical methods alone .",
    "comparison of the hybrid method to a variety of alternative schemes , including the path interchange approximation ( piza ) method of croft & gaztaaga ( 1997 ) , is given by narayanan & croft ( 1999 ) .",
    "earlier attempts to reconstruct observational data include the reconstruction of the perseus - pisces redshift survey of giovanelli & haynes ( 1989 ) by weinberg ( 1989 ) using the gaussianization technique and the reconstruction of the iras @xmath8jy redshift survey ( @xcite ) by kolatt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) using the dynamical scheme of nusser & dekel ( 1992 ) .",
    "this dynamical scheme was also used by nusser , dekel & yahil ( 1995 ) to recover the pdf of the initial density field from the iras @xmath8jy redshift survey .",
    "the primary requirements for a redshift survey to be suitable for analysis are : ( a ) good sky coverage and depth , so that the gravitational influence of regions outside the survey boundaries is small , ( b ) dense sampling to reduce shot noise errors , and ( c ) a well understood selection function , to allow accurate construction of the observed galaxy density field . with respect to these criteria , is a substantial improvement on samples used in previous analyses , and it is the best all - sky redshift survey that exists today .",
    "the pscz is a redshift survey of all galaxies in the iras point source catalog whose flux at @xmath9 is greater than @xmath10jy .",
    "it contains about @xmath11 galaxies distributed over @xmath12 of the sky , excluding only some regions of low galactic latitude where the extinction in the @xmath13 band as estimated from the iras @xmath14 background is greater than 1.5 mag .",

    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we describe the hybrid reconstruction method used to reconstruct galaxy redshift surveys , outline the assumptions involved in the analysis , and list all the steps involved in reconstructing the catalog in the order in which they are implemented . in  3 , we describe the various models that we use to reconstruct the catalog , and our construction of the mock catalogs for each model from the outputs of n - body simulations . in  4 , we illustrate the results of reconstruction analysis for 6 of our 15 models , using a variety of statistics .",
    "we quantify the accuracy of the reconstruction of a model using a `` figure - of - merit '' for each statistic , and rank the with respect to all the mock catalogs for that model .",
    "we summarize the results of reconstructing the catalog for the full set of 15 models in  5 , and describe the criteria for classifying a model as accepted , or rejected , based on its rankings .",
    "we review our results and discuss their implications in  6 , drawing general conclusions about the value of @xmath1 , the amplitude of mass density fluctuations , the bias between iras galaxies and mass , and the viability of gravitational instability with gaussian initial conditions as an explanation for the structure observed in the redshift survey .",
    "a brief overview of our results can be obtained from figures 3 , 7 , and 13 , and table 2 .",
    "we reconstruct the galaxy distribution in the catalog using the `` hybrid '' method of nw98 .",
    "we refer the reader to nw98 for a detailed discussion of the method , including its general motivation and tests of its accuracy on n - body simulations . here",
    "we provide a summary of the assumptions made in the (  2.1 ) , justification of our choice of smoothing length and sample radius for (  2.2 ) , and a step - by - step description of the procedure as applied to pscz (  2.3 ) .",
    "reconstruction analysis of a galaxy redshift catalog incorporates a number of assumptions , at various stages .",
    "these include assumptions about the cosmological parameters , about the nature of the primordial mass density fluctuations , about the process of structure formation , and about the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "the assumptions in our analysis are :    ( 1 ) : : :    structure formed by gravitational instability .",
    "the reconstruction    procedure traces the evolution of density fluctuations backward in    time under the assumption that the lss formed from the gravitational    instability of small amplitude fluctuations in the primordial mass    density field .",
    "this assumption is also implicit when the    power - restored initial density field is evolved forward in time using    a gravitational n - body code .",
    "( 2 ) : : :    the primordial density fluctuations form a gaussian random field , as    predicted by simple inflationary models for the origin of these    fluctuations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; bardeen , steinhardt , & turner    1983 ) .",
    "this assumption is the basis of the step of the procedure .",
    "( 3 ) : : :    the values of @xmath1 and the bias factor    @xmath16 , where    @xmath17 is the rms fluctuation of the    mass ( iras galaxy ) distribution in spheres of radius    @xmath7 .",
    "we vary these assumptions from one to another .",
    "we use the value of @xmath1 in correcting for    redshift - space distortions and in forward evolution of the    reconstructed initial conditions .",
    "we use the value of    @xmath18 to normalize the forward    evolution simulations .",
    "note that throughout the paper we use    @xmath6 to refer to the rms fluctuation bias on the    @xmath7 scale .",
    "( 4 ) : : :    the shape of the primordial power spectrum .",
    "in contrast to the    amplitude @xmath19 , changes to the power spectrum    shape make little difference to our results , because the shape is used    only to compute corrections to or extrapolations of the initial power    spectrum recovered from the observational data .",
    "( 5 ) : : :    the evolved galaxy density field is a monotonic function of the    evolved mass density field , once both are smoothed over scales of a    few @xmath20 .",
    "this assumption , together with the value of    @xmath19 and the assumption of gaussian initial    conditions , allows us to recover the smoothed mass density field from    the smoothed galaxy density field in preparation for the time - reversed    dynamical evolution .",
    "( 6 ) : : :    an explicit biasing scheme , i.e. , a prescription for relating the    underlying mass distribution to the observable galaxy distribution .",
    "this scheme does not influence the recovery of initial conditions , but    it is needed to select galaxies from the n - body simulation evolved    from these initial conditions , and hence to compare the to the input    data .",
    "most of our biasing schemes have a single free parameter that    controls the strength of the bias .",
    "we set the value of this parameter    to obtain the desired bias factor @xmath6 ( assumption 3 ) .      since the is a flux - limited survey , the number density of galaxies in the catalog decreases with distance from the observer .",
    "consequently , the shot - noise in the pscz galaxy distribution increases with distance .",
    "however , the procedure in the analysis relies on the assumption that the rms amplitude of galaxy density fluctuations remains the same throughout the reconstruction volume and that the contribution to these fluctuations from shot - noise in the galaxy distribution is negligible .",
    "in order to ensure that the shot - noise remains small and does not increase with distance from the observer , we create a volume - limited pscz sub - catalog in which the number density of galaxies remains constant throughout the reconstruction volume .",
    "much of the diagnostic power of the reconstruction analysis stems from the fact that non - linear gravitational evolution transfers power from large scales to small scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ; little , weinberg , & park 1991 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this power transfer erases the information about the initial mass fluctuations on scales below the non - linear scale ( fourier wavenumbers @xmath21 ) .",
    "consequently , a reconstruction method that recovers the initial fluctuations accurately up to the non - linear scale @xmath22 can reproduce many features of the evolved structures even on smaller scales @xmath23 , though not , of course , the finer details of these features . since the rms fluctuation of the iras galaxy distribution in spheres of radius @xmath24 is about 0.7 ( saunders , rowan - robinson & lawrence 1992 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , we need to recover the initial density field accurately at least up to this scale in order to take advantage of the power - transfer phenomenon .",
    "we will therefore reconstruct the pscz catalog using a gaussian smoothing length of @xmath4 , which corresponds to a top - hat smoothing scale of about @xmath25 .",
    "we create the volume - limited sub - catalog by selecting all the galaxies in the pscz located within a volume - limiting radius that are bright enough to be included in the survey even when they are located at this volume - limiting radius .",
    "we choose this volume - limiting radius , @xmath26 , based on a compromise between two conflicting requirements .",
    "first , the reconstruction volume should be large enough that it contains many independent smoothing volumes .",
    "this criterion pushes us to choose a large value for @xmath26 .",
    "second , the shot - noise in the galaxy distribution of the volume - limited catalog should be small and remain constant with distance from the observer .",
    "this condition requires a uniformly high number density of galaxies , pushing us to adopt a smaller volume - limiting radius . since we reconstruct the catalog using a gaussian smoothing length of @xmath4 , we fix @xmath26 so that the mean inter - galaxy separation at @xmath26 is @xmath27 .",
    "we adopt this criterion @xmath28 based on the rule of thumb suggested by weinberg , gott , & melott ( 1987 ) , to obtain the largest possible volume while keeping shot - noise in the galaxy distribution small enough to have little effect on the smoothed galaxy density field .",
    "we compute the number density of galaxies as a function of the distance from the observer in the pscz catalog using the maximum - likelihood method described by springel & white ( 1998 ) .",
    "we find that the number density of galaxies drops to @xmath29 at a distance of @xmath30 from the observer .",
    "we then select all the galaxies in the pscz catalog that are bright enough to be included in the survey even if they are placed at a distance of @xmath0 from the local group .",
    "the galaxies selected in this manner are then included in the sub - catalog , which is thus volume - limited to @xmath30 .",
    "the luminosities at @xmath9 of the galaxies in this sub - catalog satisfy the condition @xmath31 ( for @xmath32 ) .",
    "the steps involved in reconstructing a @xmath0 , volume - limited subset of the catalog for a given set of model assumptions are as follows : create an all - sky galaxy distribution by `` cloning '' the galaxy distribution to fill in the regions excluded in the pscz survey . the catalog does not include galaxies in regions of low galactic latitude where there is substantial obscuration by dust",
    ". however , this region could be dynamically important , since the perseus - pisces supercluster and the hydra - centaurus supercluster are both located close to the galactic plane and could even extend across it .",
    "hence , we fill in the region with galactic latitude @xmath33 , using the cloning technique introduced by lynden - bell , lahav & burstein ( 1989 ; see also yahil et al .",
    "we divide this region into 36 angular bins of @xmath34 in longitude and divide the redshift range in each angular bin into bins of @xmath35 . in each longitude - redshift bin",
    ", we assign @xmath36 artificial galaxies , where @xmath36 is equal to a random poisson deviate whose expectation value is equal to the average density of the corresponding longitude - redshift bins in the adjacent strips @xmath37 , times the volume of the bin .",
    "if there is a real galaxy in any of these longitude - redshift bins , we include it in place of an artificial galaxy .",
    "we fill the masked regions at high galactic latitudes with a random distribution of artificial galaxies having the observed mean density .",
    "the flux distribution of the artificial galaxies is identical to those of the real galaxies in the pscz catalog .",
    "we tested ( using mock catalogs ) alternate methods of handling the mask region , including assigning galaxies at random locations within the mask region at the mean galaxy density , as well as ignoring all the galaxies in the mask region .",
    "we found that the cloning technique always leads to the most accurate reconstruction of the galaxy distribution .",
    "however , the mask region does not influence analysis as much as it influences say , the analysis of the cosmological galaxy dipole ( rowan - robinson et al . in preparation ) . select a volume - limited galaxy distribution from the flux - limited pscz catalog",
    "so that the shot - noise in the volume - limited catalog is small and remains constant throughout the volume .",
    "based on the selection function of the pscz survey , we choose the volume - limiting radius @xmath30 , where the mean inter - galaxy separation is @xmath38 .",
    "compute the smoothed galaxy density field in redshift space .",
    "we create the pscz galaxy density field in redshift space by cloud - in - cell ( cic ) binning ( hockney & eastwood 1981 ) the volume - limited galaxy distribution onto a @xmath39 cubical grid that represents @xmath40 on a side .",
    "the local group observer is at the center of this cube , and the three sides of the cube are oriented along the axes of the supergalactic coordinate system . since the dynamical component of the hybrid method traces the evolution of the gravitational potential backward in time , it is necessary to model the gravitational field in the regions beyond the boundaries in order to reconstruct the density field accurately near the edges of the volume - limited catalog .",
    "we therefore supplement the volume - limited density field with the density field in an annular region @xmath41 thick beyond the volume - limiting radius of @xmath0 .",
    "we form the density field in this annular region by weighting each galaxy by the inverse of the selection function of the flux - limited pscz survey at the location of the galaxy .",
    "the full galaxy density field is therefore constructed from a volume - limited catalog in the region @xmath42 and from a flux - limited catalog in the region @xmath43 .",
    "we fill the regions beyond @xmath44 with uniform density equal to the mean density of the galaxy distribution in the volume - limited catalog , @xmath45 .",
    "we smooth the galaxy density field using a gaussian filter of radius @xmath4 .",
    "we account for boundary effects in computing the smoothed density field @xmath46 by using the ratio smoothing method of melott & dominik ( 1993 ) , _",
    "sm(*r * ) = , [ eqn : smmask ] where @xmath47 is the smoothing filter , and the mask array @xmath48 is set to 1 for pixels inside the survey region and to 0 for pixels outside the survey region .",
    "the rms amplitude of the galaxy density field smoothed with a gaussian filter of radius @xmath49 is @xmath50 .",
    "monotonically map the galaxy density field onto a theoretically determined pdf of the underlying mass distribution . in an unbiased model ,",
    "the galaxy density field is identical to the mass density field , so we skip this step entirely . in a biased model , we derive the mass density field using the pdf mapping procedure described in nw98 .",
    "we first assume a value for the bias factor @xmath6 and estimate the rms linear mass fluctuation using the equation _ 8 m = , [ eqn : bdef ] where @xmath51 and @xmath19 are the rms fluctuations in @xmath52mpc spheres in the non - linear galaxy density field and the linear mass density field , respectively .",
    "we use an n - body code to evolve forward in time an ensemble of initial mass density fields , all drawn from the same assumed power spectrum , and all normalized to this value of @xmath19 .",
    "we then derive an ensemble - averaged pdf of the smoothed final mass density fields from the evolved mass distributions of these simulations .",
    "while reconstructing the pscz catalog using a model that corresponds to this value of @xmath19 , we derive a smoothed final mass density field by monotonically mapping the smoothed pscz galaxy density field to this average pdf .",
    "this step implicitly derives and corrects for the only monotonic local biasing relation that is simultaneously consistent with the observed galaxy pdf , the assumed shape of the power spectrum and value of @xmath6 , and the assumption of gaussian initial conditions .",
    "correct for the effects of redshift - space distortions .",
    "the peculiar velocities of galaxies distort the mapping of galaxy positions from real space to redshift space , making the line - of - sight a preferred direction in an otherwise isotropic universe . since we need the real space mass density field to recover the initial mass density fluctuations , we need to correct for these redshift - space distortions . on small scales ,",
    "the velocity dispersion of a cluster stretches it along the line - of - sight into a `` finger of god '' feature that points directly toward the observer ( e.g. , @xcite ) , thereby reducing the amplitude of small - scale clustering . to correct for this effect , we first identify the clusters in redshift space using a friends - of - friends algorithm that uses a transverse linking length of @xmath53 and a radial linking length of @xmath54 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; moore , frenk , & white 1993 ; gramann , cen , & gott 1994 ) . for each cluster",
    ", we then shift the radial locations of its member galaxies so that the resulting compressed cluster has a radial velocity dispersion of @xmath55 , roughly the value expected from hubble flow across its radial extent . on large scales , the distortions arise from coherent inflows into overdense regions and outflows from underdense regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . to remove these distortions , we apply the following iterative procedure , which is a modified version of the method suggested by yahil et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and gramann et al .",
    "this method is described in detail in nw98 , and we give only a brief outline here . after deriving the mass density field in step ( 4 ) , we predict the velocity field using the second order perturbation theory relation ( @xcite ) , = f(_m)h",

    "we repeat these three steps until the corrections to the galaxy positions become negligible , which usually occurs within 3 iterations .",
    "apply the dynamical scheme to evolve the fluctuations backward in time .",
    "we compute the gravitational potential from this smoothed mass density field using the poisson equation , then evolve this gravitational potential backward in time using our modified version of the gramann ( 1993 ) method .",

    "this step enforces a gaussian pdf for the initial mass density fluctuations and yields robust reconstructions even in the non - linear regions .",
    "restore power to the recovered initial density field .",
    "non - linear gravitational evolution tends to suppress the small - scale power in the reconstructed density field , beyond the suppression due to the gaussian smoothing alone .",

    "fortunately , we can use the mock catalogs themselves to understand the correlations between the different statistics . using all 150 mock catalogs , we computed the covariance matrix of the ranks of the nine statistics , and we also computed the distribution of mock catalog ranks for each statistic conditioned on the catalog having a rank of 10 for one of the other statistics . both analyses led to the same conclusion : the nine statistics fall into five groups , and ranks within each group are correlated but ranks in one group are essentially uncorrelated with ranks in another group .",

    "the high    velocity dispersion of clusters in an @xmath3 model    suppresses the small scale correlations in redshift space , while the    large scale bulk flows , whose amplitude is proportional to    @xmath269 , enhances the correlations on large    scales .",
    "therefore , the reconstructed @xmath231 has a    shallower slope compared to the true @xmath231 , although    the rms fluctuations ( in redshift space ) of the two galaxy    distributions are similar , by construction .",
    "( 3 ) : : :    of the five models with @xmath154 , e1thb1.3 is the    only accepted model that reconstructs the catalog as well as its own    typical mock catalog . while the model e1unb1.0 is clearly rejected ,    the models e1plb1.3 and e1plb1.8 are accepted because one mock catalog    in each of these models is reconstructed worse than the catalog , and    the model e1plmdb1.3 is accepted because there are two mock catalogs    that are reconstructed worse than the catalog . thus , although four of    the five models with @xmath3 are accepted , most of    them are only moderately successful in reconstructing the catalog .",
    "( 4 ) : : :    in figure 13 , there are five models that lie on , or close to , the    constraint @xmath270 . of these",
    ", the models    o4unb1.0 and o4sqeb1.0 are clearly rejected , the models e1plb1.8 and    l2plb0.77 are accepted because there is one mock catalog that is    reconstructed worse than the catalog , while the model o3plb1.4 is    accepted because there are two mock catalogs that are reconstructed    worse than the catalog .",
    "all these models are at best only moderately    successful in reconstructing the catalog .",
    "this leads us to conclude    that the low - normalization constraint    @xmath270 ( corresponding to    @xmath271 ) , inferred from    the simplest interpretation of the velmod ( @xcite ) and redshift - space    distortion ( @xcite ) analyses of the @xmath8jy redshift    survey , is only marginally successful in reconstructing the catalog .",
    "here we have assumed that    @xmath272 to convert an    estimate of @xmath178 into a constraint on    @xmath265 . while this relation is    valid in a deterministic , linear bias model , in the case of a more    general biasing relation between galaxy and mass distributions , the    relation between @xmath6 and @xmath273 also    includes terms arising from the non - linearity and the stochasticity of    the biasing relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "we are currently investigating the    extent to which the estimates of @xmath178 using    different techniques , including potent , velmod , and the anisotropy of    the redshift - space power spectrum , are sensitive to the details of the    biasing scheme ( berlind , narayanan , & weinberg , in preparation ) .",
    "( 5 ) : : :    there are seven models including e1thb1.3 , o2plb0.5 , o4mdb0.7 ,    o4sab0.9 , l3plb0.62 , l4plb0.64 , and l5plb0.54 , in which the catalog is    reconstructed better than at least three mock catalogs corresponding    to that model .",
    "these models are the most successful in reconstructing    the properties of the galaxy distribution in the catalog . except for    the model e1thb1.3 ,",
    "all these models have @xmath274    and require that @xmath275 ( hence    @xmath276 ) , i.e. , that iras galaxies be antibiased with    respect to the mass distribution on a scale of @xmath7 .    however , we are unable to pin down the bias factor more precisely : the    model o4sab0.9 , with a small antibias , and the model o2plb0.5 , with a    large antibias , both reconstruct the catalog very well .",
    "most of the    successful models require that @xmath277    ( except the model o4sab0.9 , which requires    @xmath278 ) ( 6 ) : : :    the model o4sab0.9 , in which iras galaxies are related to the mass    according to the predictions of the semi - analytic galaxy formation    model , reconstructs the catalog very well .",
    "this accurate    reconstruction of the catalog is a non - trivial success of the    semi - analytic model , since the models o4unb1.0 and o4sqeb1.0 , with    quite similar values of @xmath1 and    @xmath19 but with different biasing relations , are    both clearly rejected .",
    "this sensitivity of the to the _ nature _ of the    biasing relation demonstrates that the analysis of a galaxy redshift    survey can distinguish between different _ bias models _ , and not just    between different values of the bias factor @xmath6 .",
    "conclusions @xmath279 are based on reconstructing the catalog under the general assumptions that the primordial mass density fluctuations form a gaussian random field and that the bias between iras galaxies and mass can be characterized by a local , monotonic function .",
    "while the assumption of gaussian initial fluctuations enables us to constrain the nature of the biasing relation , we could also use analysis in a complementary mode , i.e. , to test the level of non - gaussianity of the initial fluctuations , given our current state of knowledge of the galaxy formation process . in this regard ,",
    "the successful for a model ( o4sab0.9 ) based on a physically motivated theory of galaxy formation and cosmological parameter values supported by independent constraints supports the standard hypothesis that primordial fluctuations were not far from gaussian .",
    "there are several natural directions for extending this analysis using observational data . in this paper",
    ", we have compared the properties of the to the input galaxy distribution in redshift space alone .",
    "however , every model predicts both the real - space galaxy distribution and the fully non - linear peculiar velocity field at every point within the volume .",
    "we can then compare the velocity field predicted for any model with the observed peculiar velocities of galaxies in , say , the mark iii catalog ( @xcite ) or the sfi catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a comparison will be more accurate than a comparison involving the velocity field predicted using linear theory .",
    "the amplitude and the non - linear components of the velocity field serve as good diagnostics of the allowed values of @xmath1 and @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we can correct for inhomogeneous malmquist bias when comparing the observed density and velocity fields by using the reconstructed line - of - sight density and velocity distributions to every galaxy .",
    "alternatively , we can circumvent the effects of malmquist bias by working directly in redshift space itself ( @xcite ) .    in order to understand the galaxy formation process",
    ", it is necessary to study the relative bias between different types of galaxies as well as the absolute bias between the galaxy population as a whole and the underlying mass .",
    "for example , it is now well known that optical galaxies are more strongly clustered than iras galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "reconstruction analysis of the galaxy distribution in the optical redshift survey ( santiago et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ) , using a set of models similar to the ones discussed in this paper , will give us independent constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath19 and enable us to test whether optical galaxies trace the underlying mass .",
    "since the optical redshift survey and probe similar regions of space , the initial conditions derived from of the two data should be consistent with each other , and it should be possible to reproduce one catalog beginning with the initial conditions derived from the other by changing only the biasing model used to select galaxies from the evolved mass distribution .",
    "reconstruction analysis is thus a powerful tool to constrain the ranges of allowed values of cosmological parameters and the details of the galaxy formation process .",
    "for example , we can discriminate between models with low and high values of @xmath1 , and between models with different values of @xmath19 ( hence , different values of @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , if the cosmological parameters and the mass power spectrum can be determined precisely using other constraints , such as type ia supernovae , cosmic microwave background anisotropies , the lyman-@xmath130 forest , or weak lensing , then analysis can focus on deriving the biasing relation between the different galaxy distributions and the underlying mass distribution .",
    "knowledge of these relations will , in turn , provide strong tests of numerical and semi - analytic models for galaxy formation .",
