    "tidal interaction leads to synchronisation and orbital circularisation of close binary stars ( eg .",
    "zahn 1977 , hut 1981 ) .",
    "it may also result in double star or star - planet systems that undergo close encounters in marginally unbound orbits becoming tidally captured into highly eccentric orbits that then begin to circularise ( eg . press & teukolsky 1977 ) .",
    "a process of this kind is believed to account for giant exoplanets in close orbits with periods of a few days ( eg .",
    "weidenschilling & marzari 1996 , rasio & ford 1996 ) .",
    "the determination of the tidal evolution requires the calculation of the response of the tidally perturbed body .",
    "this involves energy and angular momentum exchange between its normal modes and the orbit leading to its evolution . in a companion paper ,",
    "ivanov et al . ( 2013 ) , subsequently referred to as paper 1 , we developed general procedures for calculating tidal energy and angular momentum exchange rates , for bodies in periodic orbits , that are associated with an identifiable regular spectrum of low frequency rotationally modified gravity modes , for rotating stars with realistic structure .",
    "these are likely to give rise to the dominant tidal response in bodies with stratification , where the tidal forcing frequencies significantly exceed the inverse of the convective time scale associated with any convection zone , so that any effective turbulent viscosity is inefficient .",
    "this is also expected to be the case for rotating stars , when the dominant tidal forcing frequencies as viewed in the rotating frame exceed twice the rotation frequency with the consequence that inertial modes are not efficiently excited in convective regions .    in paper 1",
    "we also gave expressions from which the energy and angular momentum transferred to stellar modes of oscillation as a result of parabolic encounters can be calculated .",
    "a process that could lead to tidal captures and also governs the initial phase of orbital circularisation when the orbit is very eccentric ( eg .",
    "ivanov & papaloizou 2004 ) .",
    "evaluation of the response arising from normal modes requires calculation of mode eigenfrequencies and corresponding overlap integrals that determine the strength of mode coupling with the tidal potential ( eg . press & teukolsky 1977 ) .",
    "this procedure was discussed in some detail in paper 1 for the case when the traditional approximation , appropriate for low frequency modes in stratified layers , was adopted .",
    "we remark that , as discussed in more detail in paper 1 , tidal phenomena such as energy and angular momentum exchange through parabolic encounters , or orbital evolution in the regime of so - called moderately strong viscosity ( eg .",
    "zahn 1977 , goodman @xmath0 dickson 1998 ) , where propagating rotationally modified gravity waves attain short wavelengths , and so are dissipated before reaching boundaries from which they can be reflected , are such that results are independent of the precise specification of the dissipation process . in this regime ,",
    "the wave dissipation should also occur on a time scale that is significantly longer than the locally excited wave period which will also be characteristic of the time for excitation due to tidal perturbation .",
    "in this paper we apply the formalism developed in paper 1 , where only sun - like stars were considered , to calculate the normal modes and their associated overlap integrals for a range of tidal forcing frequencies for two models of a rotating solar mass star with different ages , as well as several models of more massive rotating stars , with different ages . the dependence of these quantities on the existence and extent of convective regions and the transition between convective and radiative regions is elucidated . we also compare results obtained from the normal mode approach of paper 1 to those obtained from direct numerical simulations of parabolic encounters ( eg .",
    "papaloizou & ivanov 2010 ) delineating when there is good agreement between the two approaches .",
    "our results are then applied to the tidal capture and initial orbital circularisation of giant exoplanets for both prograde and retrograde orbits and also the tidal capture of stars to form binary systems in stellar clusters ( eg .",
    "fabian , pringle @xmath0 rees 1975 , press @xmath0 teukolsky 1977 ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the stellar models for which we calculated the quantities that enable their exchange of energy and angular momentum under tidal gravitational perturbation due to a companion to be calculated .",
    "these quantities are the overlap integrals and the low frequency rotationally modified @xmath1 mode spectrum and they are discussed in detail in paper 1 .",
    "we consider models in the range of @xmath2 with a variety of ages .",
    "as indicated in paper 1 , the extent of any convective envelope and/or core plays a significant role in determining the strength of tidal interaction as also does the detailed form of the transition between convective and radiative regions .    in section 3",
    "we discuss the properties of the numerically calculated mode spectra and overlap integrals for the stellar models considered .",
    "we also derive the rotational splitting coefficients which give the first order shifts of mode eigenfrequencies as a result of stellar rotation .",
    "in the non rotating case , the overlap integrals were found to be markedly larger for sun - like stars as compared to either a polytrope with index 3 or more massive models with much less extensive convective regions .",
    "this is because of the convective envelope and is expected from the theory developed in paper 1 .",
    "the overlap integrals are also calculated for rotating models under the neglect of centrifugal distortion and the adoption of the traditional approximation as indicated in paper 1 .",
    "results for angular velocities of rotation in units of the critical rotation rate in the range @xmath3 are presented .",
    "we go on to apply our results to evaluate the energy and angular momentum exchanged as a result of a parabolic encounter with a companion .",
    "these enable the possibility of tidal capture from unbound orbits to be assessed .",
    "in addition the time scale for the initial stages of orbital circularisation to occur for low planetary mass companions is estimated .",
    "we compare energy and angular momentum transfers obtained through the normal mode / overlap integral approach to results obtained from solving the encounter problem as an initial value problem numerically ( papaloizou & ivanov 2010 ; ivanov & papaloizou 2011 ) for the full range of rotation rates and for pericentre distances that are not too large to make calculation intractable . both prograde and retrograde encounters are considered .",
    "we found that the methods are in good agreement apart from the situation where the system is close to pseudosynchronization . in this case",
    "the effective tidal forcing frequencies are comparable to the rotation frequency and inertial modes , not taken into account in the normal mode approach can play a significant role . as the characteristic",
    "tidal forcing frequencies are expected to be significantly larger than stellar rotation frequencies , inertial modes are unlikely to be excited in the star during the initial stages of the formation of close in giant planet orbits of hot jupiters. accordingly we do not pursue the issue of inertial modes further in this paper .    finally in section 5 we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "we remark that as in our earlier work ( ivanov & papaloizou 2011 ) , which considered polytropic models with index , 3 , we find that tidal interaction with the central star is significantly stronger for retrograde orbits and that it could play a significant role in the circularisation process for giant planets , so potentially reducing the amount of potentially destructive energy dissipation in the planetary interior .",
    "the basic definitions and notation adopted in this paper are the same as in paper 1 .",
    "we use either a spherical coordinate system @xmath4 or associated cylindrical polar coordinate system @xmath5 with origin at the centre of mass of the star .",
    "when viewed in an inertial frame , the unperturbed star rotates uniformly about the @xmath6 axis with angular velocity @xmath7 . for our reference frame",
    ", we adopt the rotating frame in which the unperturbed star appears at rest .",
    "our calculations are for rotating stars of different masses and ages . as in paper 1 centrifugal distortion",
    "is neglected with the consequence that equilibrium structures are not modified by rotation . therefore standard spherically symmetric models are used .",
    ".radii , masses , ages and mean densities for models used in our calculations .",
    "radii , masses and mean densities are expressed in units corresponding to the present day sun , stellar ages are expressed in years.[t1 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we consider models of stars of masses @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 of different ages .",
    "stellar masses are expressed in solar masses ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "radii , @xmath13 are expressed in solar radii ( @xmath14 ) and ages , expressed in years , are given in table [ t1 ] .",
    "additionally , we have calculated all quantities of interest for a stellar model consisting of a polytrope with index @xmath15 the mass and radius are scaled to solar values and the adiabatic index @xmath16 this serves as reference model for our analysis and is referred to as model 1p .",
    "all realistic stellar models apart from model 1b were kindly provided to us by i.w .",
    "the numerical code used to obtain these models is discussed in roxburgh ( 2008 ) .",
    "model 1b is for the present day sun .",
    "it is discussed in christensen - dalsgaard et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . unlike models described elsewhere in a similar context ( see mcmillan , mcdermott @xmath0 taam 1987 ) our models have metallicity appropriate for population i stars .",
    "the zero age hydrogen mass fraction x=0.7 and the mass fraction of heavy elements z=0.02 for all models .",
    "convective heat transport is described by a standard form of mixing length theory ( kippenhahn et al .",
    "2013 ) . mixing in convective and semi - convective zones",
    "is dealt with by incorporating diffusion into the equations governing the evolution of the chemical abundances ( see eggleton 1972 ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is taken to be @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the convective velocity and @xmath19 is the mixing length .    as is discussed in paper 1 when low frequency gravity modes are considered ,",
    "their important properties are found to be mainly determined by the functional forms of the density , @xmath20 and the brunt - v@xmath21is@xmath21l@xmath22 frequency @xmath23 . in particular , the locations of stably stratified radiative regions , where @xmath24 and the behaviour of @xmath23 in the neighbourhood of transitions from stably stratified to convective regions , are particularly significant .",
    "for the models described here the functional forms in these transition regions are strongly affected by the evolutionary history of the chemical composition profiles .",
    "although chemical diffusion is included , the coefficient is zero in radiative regions and large in convective regions so that mixing is efficient there .",
    "this results in the possibility of very rapidly varying or even discontinuous abundance profiles according to how the boundary between a radiative and convective zone moves with evolution .",
    "suppose this interface moves with speed @xmath25 we can form the dimensionless quantity @xmath26 the latter ratio being the ratio of the convection time scale to the evolutionary time scale .",
    "on dimensionless grounds we might expect the width of the transition region , @xmath27 between a convective and radiative zone would be given by an expression of the form @xmath28 where the form of the function @xmath29 is determined by the way the diffusion coefficient vanishes as the radiative zone is entered and the evolutionary history .",
    "simple modelling suggests that @xmath29 is a monotonic function of its argument , with the variation being more rapid for diffusion coefficients with more rapid cutoffs .",
    "for example a linear variation is expected when the diffusion coefficient inside the radiative region vanishes as @xmath30 , with @xmath31 being a distance of one mixing length away from a retreating convection zone boundary .",
    "note that , @xmath32 , is very small leading to the possibility of very thin transition layers when the evolutionary history is such that the composition in a convective zone differs significantly from its immediate surroundings .",
    "at such a transition the mean molecular weight changes while hydrostatic equilibrium enforces continuity of the pressure .",
    "there is a then a rapid change in the density with an associated spike in the density gradient and the square of the brunt - v@xmath21is@xmath21l@xmath21 frequency .",
    "as this results from the density gradient , a large effect can be produced with there being only small jumps in the density or chemical profile .",
    "plots of the density @xmath33 and the square of the brunt - v@xmath21is@xmath21l@xmath21 frequency , @xmath34 against radius , for the models used in our calculations are given in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig4 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we illustrate these two quantities the two models with @xmath35 discussed in detail and adopted in paper 1 .",
    "note that negative values of @xmath36 that occur in convective regions are not shown .",
    "these models exhibit a similar and rather simple structure .",
    "they have a radiative core and convective envelope with a transition at a similar total radius fraction .",
    "the young sun - like star , model 1a , has a smaller radius than model 1b , which corresponds to the present day sun .",
    "it accordingly has a larger mean density and is therefore , less susceptible to tidal influence from a perturbing companion with a given orbital period .",
    "models 1.5a-1.5c , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , are for a star of mass @xmath37 at different ages .",
    "their structure is more complex than that of sun - like stars .",
    "the youngest model 1.5a ( plotted with dotted curves ) is similar to models 1a and 1b in that it also has convective envelope with a convective core being absent .",
    "we remark that a weak density inversion occurs very close to the surface in these models .",
    "this is a well known effect that occurs as hydrogen is ionised in convective envelopes where the energy transport due to convection is inefficient ( see eg . latour 1970 ) .",
    "the ionisation zone is very thin in such cases , and such that the reduction in the mean molecular weight , that occurs with weak pressure variation there , causes the density inversion .",
    "the density in these layers is very small and so they do not affect any of the tidal response calculations presented in this paper significantly .",
    "however , on account of the general similarity of the models , we expect that the overlap integrals , @xmath38 characterising the strength of tidal interactions and discussed in detail in paper 1 , will have similar properties to those obtained for sun - like stars .",
    "but , the density at the base of convection zone , expressed in terms of the mean density @xmath39 , @xmath40 is smaller than the corresponding quantity for models 1a and 1b .",
    "we find @xmath41 and @xmath42 for model 1.5a , and either of models 1a or 1b respectively .",
    "the analytic wkbj theory developed in paper 1 predicts that the overlap integrals , being determined by the presence of a convective envelope , are proportional to @xmath43 in the limit of sufficiently small eigenfrequencies ( see equations ( 111 ) , ( 113 ) and ( 115 ) of paper 1 ) .",
    "accordingly , we expect that for a given value of the eigenfrequency , @xmath44 values for model 1.5a will be smaller than those for younger models , by a factor corresponding to the square root of the ratio of the respective values of @xmath45 here we recall that as the mode spectrum is dense the overlap integrals are regarded as continuous functions of frequency .",
    "let us note that energy and angular momentum exchanges due to tides associated with a normal mode are , in general , proportional to the square of the appropriate overlap integral ( see paper 1 ) .",
    "that means that in a situation where the contribution from the convective envelope and the region of its boundary with the inner radiative zone determines the value of the overlap integral , energy and angular momentum exchanges are approximately proportional to @xmath46 , see also equation ( 13 ) of goodman @xmath0 dickson ( 1998 ) .",
    "our expectation is confirmed by calculation , see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . the evolved models 1.5b and 1.5c have both convective envelopes and convective cores .",
    "however , @xmath47 at the base of convective envelope is relatively small , being @xmath48 for model 1.5c and @xmath49 for model 1.5b .",
    "this has the consequence that the contribution to the overlap integrals associated with the presence of a convective envelope is strongly suppressed .",
    "models 1.5b and 1.5c also have convective cores .",
    "but , the transition region between the radiative region and the convective core is extremely sharp in these models ( see discussion in section [ modeldesc ] above ) , and must be considered as a discontinuity for eigenfunctions with characteristic wavelength larger than the typical size of the transition zone .",
    "the width of the latter , @xmath50 is of the order of or smaller than the grid size with @xmath51 , @xmath52 for models 1.5b and 1.5c , respectively .",
    "we emphasise that the detailed form of this transition region should be determined from a complete treatment of convection , including overshoot , see eg . roxburgh ( 1978 ) ,",
    "zahn ( 1991 ) , and the effects of stellar rotation , etc .",
    "this can not be undertaken at present .",
    "however , when eigenfunctions have typical wavelengths larger than the size of the transition zone , one can not assume that the brunt - v@xmath21is@xmath21l@xmath21 frequency increases as a power of distance from the boundary of the convective region and perform a standard wkbj analysis that assumes the response wavelength is significantly shorter than the transition width .",
    "accordingly estimates of quantities characterising tidal interactions , such as overlap integrals or related quantities , for example the quantity @xmath53 used by zahn ( 1977 ) , based on this assumption are not valid .",
    "let us estimate typical periods of modes , where such calculations are potentially formally invalid .",
    "for definiteness we consider model 1.5b .",
    "we assume that the width of the transition zone is as small as suggested by our numerical model . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we see that for this model , the value of brunt - v@xmath21is@xmath21l@xmath21 frequency at the maximum of the spike close to the convective core is @xmath54 and the radius of convective core @xmath55 in our dimensionless units .    from the wkbj theory applied to gravity waves ,",
    "the characteristic wavelength , @xmath56 , can be estimated through @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the eigenfrequency and it is assumed that the star is non - rotating , see eg .",
    "christensen - dalsgaard ( 1998 ) . on the other hand @xmath59 should be larger than the width of the transition region , estimated above as @xmath60 or smaller .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath61 in natural units for this inequality to be valid . from table 1",
    "it follows that this corresponds to periods @xmath62 .",
    "this means that estimates based on a standard wkbj analysis may be inapplicable for all periods of interest .",
    "let us stress , however , that the width of the transition region may be much larger than was assumed in order to obtain this estimate ( see discussion in section [ modeldesc ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the forms of the density and the square of brunt - v@xmath21is@xmath22l@xmath21 frequency for models with @xmath63 .",
    "the youngest model , model 2a ( dot - dashed curve ) is fully radiative . we expect that for this model , overlap integrals are suppressed at low frequencies as compared to models with convective regions .",
    "the overlap integrals associated with such models are expected to decrease with eigenfrequency , @xmath58 , faster than any power of @xmath64 as happens for a polytropic star represented as model 1p .",
    "thus , tidal interactions determined by low frequency gravity modes become rather inefficient in this case .",
    "models 2b-2d are similar to those with mass @xmath37 with the difference that the convective envelope is practically absent .",
    "therefore , contributions to the overlap integrals coming from the envelope region should be very small .",
    "there are also almost discontinuous transitions from radiative envelopes to convective cores .",
    "thus we conclude that previous estimates of the strength of tidal interactions based on the regular behaviour of @xmath36 close to this transition may need revision .",
    "finally , in fig [ fig4 ] we plot the density and square of the brunt - v@xmath21is@xmath22l@xmath21 frequency for a model of a young star with @xmath65 .",
    "the structure of this model is rather simple and similar to the cases of evolved stars with @xmath63 .",
    "there is no convective envelope in this model and , again , there is a quite sharp transition between the radiative region and convective core .",
    "in this section we consider the quantities that determine the tidal interactions for given orbital parameters and properties of decay of free stellar oscillation either due to viscosity or non - linear effects .",
    "these are the eigenfrequencies of free pulsations @xmath66 , normalised overlap integrals @xmath67 , and , in case of small rotational frequency @xmath68 , the coefficients @xmath69 which determine the splitting of eigenfrequencies due to rotation in the non - rotating frame .",
    "we discus how these quantities depend on stellar structure    the overlap integrals are discussed in detail in paper 1 . here we briefly recall them for completeness . in general , @xmath67 is given by the expression @xmath70 where it is implied that the inner scalar product of any two complex vectors @xmath71 and @xmath72 is determined by integration over the cylindrical coordinates @xmath73 and @xmath6 as @xmath74 here @xmath75 denotes the complex conjugate , @xmath76 is the spherical function , @xmath77 is the lagrangian displacement vector corresponding to a particular eigenmode with eigenfrequency @xmath66 .",
    "it is assumed that in all expressions the dependence of @xmath77 on the azimuthal angle @xmath78 , @xmath79 , is factored out . in general the azimuthal mode number ,",
    "@xmath80 is such that @xmath81 however , we shall consider only @xmath82 below as this is the most important case ( see paper 1 ) .",
    "the norm @xmath83 is determined by the expression @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an integro - differential self - adjoint operator , which when operating on @xmath86 gives the restoring acceleration due to the action of gravity and pressure forces .    when the star is non - rotating the overlap integrals reduce to the form given by press @xmath0 teukolsky ( 1977 ) .",
    "a similar expression can be obtained in the so - called traditional approximation discussed below and in paper 1 . in that case",
    "we have @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in the expressions ( [ q4 ] ) and",
    "( [ q5 ] ) @xmath92 and @xmath93 give the radial dependences of the radial component of the displacement vector and the angular components , respectively , in the traditional approximation .",
    "the quantities @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are functions of @xmath97 , their explicit form and the dependence on @xmath97 are discussed in paper 1 .",
    "note that @xmath98 is an eigenvalue associated with acceptable solutions of the laplace tidal equation .",
    "when the star does not rotate , the laplace tidal equation reduces to the legendre equation , the solution of which is the associated legendre function .",
    "we then have @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and the expressions ( [ q4 ] ) and ( [ q5 ] ) reduce to their standard form as given by e.g. press @xmath0 teukolsky ( 1977 ) and ivanov @xmath0 papaloizou ( 2004 ) .",
    "hereafter we express all quantities of interest in natural units .",
    "thus , eigenfrequencies are expressed in terms of the natural stellar frequency @xmath102 and the overlap integrals in terms of @xmath103      let us first discuss the eigenfrequencies and overlap integrals for non - rotating models . in this case we set @xmath104 and @xmath105 in ( [ q4 ] ) and ( [ q5 ] ) , respectively .",
    "eigenfrequencies , and eigenfunctions were obtained by a shooting method described in section 5.2 of paper 1 . here",
    "we note that we integrated the standard full set of four equations describing adiabatic pulsations ( eg .",
    "christensen - dalsgaard 1998 ) to find these quantities for relatively large values of eigenfrequencies @xmath106 depending on the particular model .",
    "these were then used to evaluate the overlap integrals . for smaller eigenfrequencies ,",
    "the cowling approximation is used to find the eigenfrequencies and the expression ( 78 ) of paper 1 was employed to find the overlap integrals .",
    "this expression is equivalent to the original one presented above provided the cowling approximation is used to find eigenmodes .",
    "we checked that in the intermediate region for which @xmath107 both methods give practically the same results .",
    "the advantage of using the expression ( 78 ) of paper 1 in the low frequency limit is the fact that the integrand in this expression is less oscillatory in comparison to the integrand in the original expression , thus allowing us to significantly increase accuracy of determination of @xmath67 in this limit where the eigenfunctions contain a large number of nodes .",
    "models of massive stars have very rapid variations of of @xmath36 , see figs [ fig2]-[fig4 ] in the transition regions between radiative envelopes and convective cores , . since the characteristic radial extent of these variations can be of the order of the initial stellar model grid size a treatment of discontinuities may be needed .",
    "we prefer , however , to avoid this situation in our approach . to deal with this issue",
    ", we worked with computational grids which had a much larger number of grid points than were originally used to represent the structure of the stellar models .",
    "state variables were interpolated onto our more refined grid as smooth functions .",
    "there were then no discontinuities in the eigenfunctions on the refined grid , see figs [ eigenfun ] , [ eigenfun1 ] .",
    "the results of calculations of overlap integrals are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5]-[fig8 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the results for models 1p , 1a and 1b . since the polytropic model 1p has been discussed extensively elsewhere ( eg .",

    "this is due to the fact that @xmath67 corresponding to sun - like stars has contributions arising from the presence of a convective envelope .",
    "these decay as a power of @xmath58 in the limit @xmath109 while the overlap integrals of the polytropic model may be shown to decay faster than any power of @xmath110 note that the overlap integrals for the solar model have also been calculated recently by weinberg et al ( 2012 ) .",
    "our calculations for the model 1b agree quite well with their results .",
    "it is of interest to note that the overlap integrals for this model are not monotonic at large frequencies .",
    "this effect is even more prominent for the models with @xmath37 and @xmath111 discussed below , where several peaks in the values of @xmath67 at values of frequencies corresponding to pressure modes are observed , see figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "since this effect is not important for our purposes we do not discuss it here .",
    "however , we would like to mention that it appears to be rather generic , e.g. it is present in the dependence of @xmath67 on @xmath58 in a model of red giant star , see fuller et al ( 2012 ) .",

    ", only model 1.5a has overlap integrals larger than those of the polytrope at small values of @xmath110 as discussed above this is because of the fact that this model has a rather extended convective envelope . from our analytical theory developed in paper 1",
    ", it follows that in the case of model 1.5a , the contribution determined by the presence of this region should be roughly three times smaller than that arising for sun - like stars . as seen from [ fig6 ] , this is confirmed by our numerical results .",
    "more evolved models 1.5b and 1.5c have rather small overlap integrals in the range of frequencies plotted .",
    "they are even smaller than those of the polytropic star .",
    "this indicates that tidal interactions determined by the excitation of eigenmodes in the shown range of frequencies are relatively weak for these models .",
    "results for stars of mass @xmath63 are shown in fig .",
    "this case is rather similar to the previous one .",
    "however , the more massive stars do not have well pronounced convective envelopes and , therefore , their overlap integrals are rather small for the range of frequencies shown , being several times smaller than those for a polytropic star . finally , in fig . [ fig8 ] the overlap integrals of a young star with @xmath65 are shown .",
    "they are rather similar to , though slightly smaller than those of a polytropic star for the range of frequencies shown .",

    "namely , as follows from the discussion above , the values of the radial contributions to overlap integrals for stars with extended convective envelopes are mainly determined by contributions coming from the convective envelope and from the vicinity of the base of the convective zone .",

    "it turns out that in case of retrograde rotation , the value of @xmath94 corresponding to the frequencies , where this minimum is observed , is approximately equal to thirty , and , therefore , the main contributions to the overlap integrals are strongly suppressed .",

    "interestingly , the energy transfers for models 1a and 1b are quite close to each other regardless of the fact that the overlap integrals corresponding to model 1a are larger than those of model 1b .",
    "this is explained by observation that the number of eigenmodes contributing to the tidal interaction is larger in the case of model 1b .",

    "the energy transfer found giersz ( 1986 ) is significantly smaller than we obtain in this paper .",
    "since our results are obtained using three independent methods , we believe that the giersz ( 1986 ) result underestimates the energy transfer , though the origin of the discrepancy is unclear .",

    "the fact that the model of present day sun , model 1b , can be tidally excited more efficiently than the corresponding polytropic model , leads to the conclusion that taking into account realistic stellar models can significantly increase estimates of the contribution of tides exerted on the star for the orbital evolution of jupiter mass exoplanets on highly eccentric orbits .",
    "the enhanced tidal interaction can produce a significant change of the orbital semimajor axis in a time of less than @xmath201 years when @xmath202 note that this contribution can be further amplified for stars rotating in the opposite sense to that of the orbital motion , as discussed in lai ( 1997 ) , ivanov @xmath0 papaloizou ( 2011 ) and below .",

    "however , it is important to point out that , for a given @xmath205 the circularisation times , @xmath162 , corresponding to the more massive models are significantly smaller than those for the sun - like models .",

    "this disagreement is possibly determined by the fact that we use the cowling and traditional approximations to calculate the eigenspectrum in the normal mode approach .",

    "in fact there are two corrections , the first arising from the truncation of the envelope at @xmath270 is expected to increase @xmath134 by about an order of magnitude ( ogilvie 2013 ) . the second , due to the fact that the envelope is on top of a more centrally condensed model than the polytrope and so has a lower base density , is expected to decrease @xmath134 by a similar factor , thus in order to make rough estimates , we simply assume these effects approximately cancel out .",
    "use of ( [ pi2005 ] ) for @xmath271 gives @xmath272 which is about five times the value indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] .",
    "this indicates that inertial modes are likely to be significant under conditions of pseudosynchronization for @xmath261 similar estimates indicate that is is also the case for @xmath259    in support the above discussion , we comment that the excitation of inertial waves is seen in our simulation of the prograde encounter of model 1b with @xmath196 and @xmath273 to illustrate this , contours of the product of the lagrangian displacement in the @xmath78 direction and @xmath274 are shown in an upper quadrant at a time after the encounter is over and the energy transfer has been completed in fig.[figsection ] .",
    "the square of this quantity is proportional to the kinetic energy density of the disturbance associated with motion in the @xmath78 direction .",
    "the presence of rotationally modified @xmath1 modes is evident in the radiative core .",
    "inertial waves are seen in the convective envelope .",
    "these show some reflections and graze the boundary with the radiative core as would be expected for critical latitude phenomena ( see papaloizou & ivanov 2010 ) .    when @xmath256 the agreement between two approaches is less good .",
    "the difference between @xmath134 is typically a factor of two for the prograde encounters and a factor of three for retrograde encounters at larger @xmath248 the fact that such retrograde encounters give a larger disagreement can be explained by the shift of the eigenfrequencies of the dominant excited modes as viewed in the rotating frame .",
    "these propagate against the sense of rotation of the star towards larger absolute values as @xmath158 increases . in this case",
    "both the traditional and cowling approximations used in our normal mode approach become less appropriate .    in fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] we plot the amount of angular momentum transferred , @xmath275 as a function of @xmath248 for prograde encounters , in contrast to @xmath276 @xmath137 changes sign at a value of @xmath203 where the star rotates at the pseudosynchronization rate .",
    "accordingly , we plot the absolute value of @xmath137 in this figure .",
    "the form of @xmath277 for prograde encounters is non - monotonic , having a deep minimum for @xmath278 where @xmath279 .",
    "when @xmath280 @xmath137 is positive ( ie . directed in the sense of stellar rotation ) , on the other hand when @xmath281 it is negative . in the case of retrograde encounters",
    "@xmath137 is always positive ( ie . directed in the sense of the orbital motion ) .",
    "the behaviour of the deviation between the direct numerical and normal mode approaches is similar to that found for @xmath247 we see again a better agreement for prograde encounters , with the exception of the encounter having @xmath262 and @xmath196 , where the deviation is rather large .",
    "this may be explained as before .",
    "overall , our results indicate quantitative agreement between the two approaches when the angular frequency is relatively small , say , @xmath282 except for rotation rates close to @xmath283 for faster rotators the agreement is not so good with the direct numerical approach giving values of @xmath134 that are a factor of @xmath284 smaller for retrograde encounters and a factor of @xmath284 larger for prograde encounters as long as @xmath285 these discrepancies probably arise from the neglect of inertial waves in the normal mode treatment as well as use of the traditional approximation and the neglect of self - gravity .",
    "excitation of inertial waves would cause @xmath134 to increase near to pseudosynchronization while the neglect of self - gravity and the use of the traditional approximation become less appropriate for modes excited at the high relative forcing frequencies that occurs for large retrograde stellar rotation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig19 ] we plot the energy transfer in the inertial frame , @xmath250 related to @xmath134 and @xmath137 through equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "as for the angular momentum transfer , it is negative for prograde encounters with @xmath286 , where @xmath287 , and , therefore , absolute values are plotted .",
    "the energy exchanged for prograde encounters has a sharp minimum at @xmath288 , which moves towards larger values of @xmath159 as the magnitude of @xmath112 decreases .",
    "note that @xmath136 is always positive for retrograde encounters .",
    "let us recall that solid , dashed , dot dashed and dotted curves apply to @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 and @xmath226 , respectively . together with these results",
    "we also show the energy transfer calculated adopting the perturbative approach where it is assumed that the overlap integrals are not modified by rotation and the eigenfrequencies can be calculated using ( [ eq0 ] ) .",
    "the respective curves are represented by dot dot dashed lines .",
    "symbols on these lines show different values of @xmath289 with circles , squares and diamonds corresponding to @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , respectively .",
    "remarkably , the perturbative approach agrees quite well with the one based on the traditional approximation , especially for retrograde encounters , even for the largest value of @xmath222 adopted . in the case of prograde encounters",
    "there is quantitative agreement when @xmath290 , and , accordingly , @xmath291 .",
    "since the perturbative approach does not require the calculation of the overlap integrals for every given value of @xmath265 the evaluation of @xmath250 is simplified to a great extent .",
    "it suffices to use the overlap integrals obtained for non - rotating stars together with the frequency splitting coefficients , @xmath292 given above for a number of stellar models ( see eg .",
    "ivanov @xmath0 papaloizou 2011 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig20 ] we plot the characteristic timescale of evolution of the semimajor axis given by equation ( [ eq3 ] ) as a function of @xmath293 the line styles are as for fig . [ fig17 ] .",
    "it is seen that for a given value of @xmath205 retrograde encounters have smaller values of @xmath162 than the corresponding prograde encounter .",
    "one can see , that for fast rotators , rotation has a significant influence on the strength of tidal encounters ( see also lai 1997 and ivanov @xmath0 papaloizou 2011 ) . for example , when @xmath294 the binary system may significantly change its semimajor axis in less than @xmath295yrs for @xmath296days and @xmath297days for prograde and retrograde encounters , respectively .",
    "although stellar rotation significantly slows down in time this effect may contribute to explaining observed exoplanetary systems containing hot jupiters with a significant mismatch between directions of their orbital angular momentum and the rotation axis of their central stars .    in fig .",
    "[ fig21 ] we show the tidal capture radius @xmath167 for the rotating 1b model . as seen from this fig .",
    "the value of @xmath167 is larger for retrograde encounters as compared to prograde encounters as was first noted by lai ( 1997 ) .",
    "this effect is prominent only when either , the rotation rate is quite large , or the characteristic relative velocity , @xmath298 , is small .",
    "it is instructive to compare the dependence of @xmath167 on the rotation rate found here with results of lai ( 1997 ) , bearing in mind , however , that in that work , a tidal encounter of a @xmath299 polytrope having @xmath300 and @xmath301 with a point mass with @xmath302 was considered .",
    "when @xmath303 we find @xmath304 and @xmath305 for prograde and retrograde encounters with the rather large value , @xmath306 on the other hand lai ( 1997 ) gives values of @xmath307 and @xmath308 for the same encounter , but with @xmath309 .",
    "the ratio of the radii is approximately @xmath310 in both cases .",
    "since the rotation rate of our model is smaller , the relative variation of the capture radius produced by changing from retrograde to prograde rotation is somewhat larger in models of stars with realistic sun - like structure as expected .    finally , in figs .",
    "[ fig22]-[fig25 ] we plot the same quantities as in figs .",
    "[ fig17 ] , [ fig18 ] , [ fig20 ] and [ fig21 ] , but for the rotating model 1.5a .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath7 are @xmath311 , @xmath312 and @xmath225 the results behave in a similar way to those found for the rotating sun - like star , with the difference that the transfers of energy and angular momentum for a given value of @xmath203 are smaller for the more massive star , as is found in the non - rotating case .",
    "the evolution timescales @xmath162 are , however , larger for the sun - like star due to its larger average density .",
    "for example , model 1.5a with @xmath313 gives an evolution timescale of less than @xmath295years for retrograde encounters , when the orbital period after circularisation @xmath314 days .",
    "of course , as in the previous case , in order to make realistic calculations , one must take into account the evolution of the stellar structure as it affects the mean density of the star , as well as the braking of the stellar rotation with age .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the energy and angular momentum transferred to a number of population i stellar models with different masses , ages and states of rotation through dynamical tides , as a result of an encounter with a companion on a parabolic orbit .",
    "the results were used to estimate the initial evolution time scale of the semimajor axis of a highly eccentric orbit .",
    "complementary methods based on calculation of the normal mode response and a direct numerical approach involving the solution of the encounter problem as an initial value problem were used .",
    "these showed quantitative agreement for small and moderate rotation rates @xmath315 as long as the distance of closest approach was small enough that the stellar angular velocity is less than the so - called pseudosynchronization frequency .",
    "it was shown that when the energy and angular momentum transferred is expressed in natural units that factor out the dependence on stellar mass and radius so that encounters are characterised by the tidal parameter , @xmath203 these quantities depend significantly on the stellar structure .",
    "the tidal transfers are significantly larger for models having sufficiently extended convective envelopes .",
    "thus , when @xmath316 other things being equal , the non - rotating 1.5a model undergoes an energy transfer approximately @xmath317 times larger than occurs for models 1.5b and 1.5c , which is explained by the presence of a more extended convective envelope .",
    "however , as the solar models 1a and 1b have more extended convective envelopes than models 1.5b and 1.5c which are older than model 1.5a , the energy transferred to them is greater .",
    "the effect increases in significance for larger values of @xmath248 thus when @xmath316 it is a factor of @xmath318 times larger .",
    "since the models of more massive stars with @xmath319 and @xmath11 that we considered essentially do not have convective envelopes , the energy transferred to them , expressed in natural units , is rather small .",
    "thus model 5a has a value of @xmath134 ten times smaller than that for model 1b when @xmath261 stellar rotation was found to play an important role , with dynamic tides being significantly amplified for retrograde encounters , and weakened for prograde ones , see also lai ( 1997 ) and ivanov @xmath0 papaloizou ( 2011 ) .",
    "we studied the effect of rotation using the direct numerical approach , the normal mode approach adopting the traditional approximation , and also simply treating the effects of rotation by perturbation theory . in the latter treatment",
    ", it was assumed that the overlap integrals are not modified by rotation but that eigenfrequencies are shifted by an amount proportional to the product of the splitting coefficient @xmath118 and rotation frequency @xmath265 as expected from first order perturbation theory .",
    "it was shown that the perturbative approach gives results in quantitative agreement with the treatment based on the normal mode approach with the traditional approximation , even for fast rotators , as long as the energy transferred in the inertial frame @xmath250 was positive , being approximately equivalent to the condition that the star rotated at less than the pseudosynchronization rate .    as implied by our discussion in section 4.5 ,",
    "this is also the condition for the forcing frequencies to be large enough that the excitation of inertial modes is not expected to play an important role .",
    "a condition for this to apply for prograde encounters can be approximately found by requiring that the characteristic forcing frequency , @xmath320 exceed @xmath321 making use of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , we obtain the condition as @xmath322 noting that for a typical rotation period of a t tauri star of @xmath323 days and solar parameters , equation ( [ eq2a ] ) gives @xmath324 days , the implication is that the excitation of stellar inertial modes do not play a significant role in the tidal capture of hot jupiters into final prograde orbits with periods of a few days .",
    "this simplifies applications of the theory to particular systems since use of the the perturbative approach requires only the calculation of the overlap integrals , and the splitting coefficients for a given non rotating stellar model .",
    "these are provided for all models considered in this paper .",
    "in addition to the methods described above , we also applied the purely analytic approach developed in paper 1 to the solar model 1b , and showed that it gave results differing from those obtained numerically by at most 40 per cent in the range @xmath325 .",
    "it is important to stress again that the energy and angular momentum transfers are significantly larger for this model as compared to models of more massive stars and a reference model of @xmath175 polytrope .",
    "the stellar mean density plays an important role in applications to particular astrophysical systems .",
    "this is because tides become relatively more efficient for radially extended low - density objects .",
    "in particular , timescale @xmath162 for the evolution of the semimajor axis , considered as a function of the orbital period after the period of circularisation @xmath205 becomes smaller for more rarefied evolved massive models regardless of the fact that other effects , such as possessing a smaller convective envelope , act in the direction of making tidal interaction less efficient as discussed above .",
    "thus , @xmath162 is less than @xmath295yrs for non - rotating models 1b and 1.5c when @xmath326days and @xmath327days , respectively . for fast rotators this time",
    "can be significantly reduced for retrograde encounters .",
    "thus , in the case of a 1.5a model rotating with the angular frequency @xmath313 @xmath328yrs when @xmath314days .    when the theory of dynamic tides is applied to particular astrophysical processes , such as the tidal circularisation of exoplanet orbits starting with a high eccentricity induced by gravitational scattering , or the process of tidal capture of stars in stellar clusters , it is important to calculate the overlap integrals and the coefficients @xmath329 for a grid of stellar models of different ages .",
    "it is also important to understand the evolution of the stellar structure , and rotation rate as a function of time .",
    "the outcome of tidal evolution may differ significantly for stars with different masses and different rotational history .",
    "as discussed in paper 1 the overlap integrals are also important for discussing the tidal evolution of binaries with small orbital eccentricity . in particular , for forcing frequencies large enough that inertial modes are not expected to be excited , they fully determine the effect of tidal interactions in the regime of moderately large viscosity , see eg .",
    "goodman @xmath0 dickson 1998 and paper 1 . the results of zahn ( 1977 ) can only be recovered only when the overlap integrals are @xmath330 this dependence approximately holds for sun - like stars in the limit of @xmath331 . it is determined by the functional form of the square of the brunt - v@xmath21is@xmath332l@xmath21 frequency in the neighbourhood of the transition from radiative to convective regions .",
    "in particular the @xmath333 dependence of the overlap integrals requires that , in the neighbourhood of the transition , the square of the brunt - v@xmath21is@xmath332l@xmath21 frequency is a linear function of the difference between a given radius and the radius of the transition .",
    "this assumption may not be valid for a massive star , where the transition from the radiative envelope to the convective core can be extremely sharp .",
    "in particular , the zahn ( 1977 ) theory does not apply to binaries with ultra - short periods @xmath334 , where the overlap integrals decrease much faster with @xmath64 see the discussion of figs .",
    "[ fig5]-[fig8 ] in the text .",
    "a theory appropriate for large orbital periods must consider the origin of , and take into account , possible rapid variations of the the brunt - v@xmath332is@xmath21l@xmath21 frequency in the neighbourhood of the convective to radiative transition .",
    "this is left for future work .",
