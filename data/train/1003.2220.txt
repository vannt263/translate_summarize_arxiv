    "subdivision schemes are efficient iterative procedures for generating finer and finer grids of points in @xmath3 and are used to design smooth curves or surfaces . starting with some initial grid of points",
    ", a binary scalar subdivision scheme computes the coordinates of the finer grid points @xmath4 , inheriting the topology of the coarser ones , via local averages @xmath5 these averaging rules depend on the coefficients of the corresponding subdivision mask @xmath6 which we assume to be some finitely supported sequence of real numbers .",
    "if the mask is chosen appropriately , the grids with the vertices @xmath7 , as @xmath8 goes to infinity , can be interpreted as approximations of the values of a limiting curve or surface .",
    "the locality of the method and its algorithmic simplicity ensure that the subdivision recursion is fast , efficient , and easy to implement .",
    "these features and the connection between subdivision and other multiresolution methods have led to an increasing popularity of subdivision in computer graphics , in computer aided geometrical design , and in wavelet and frame constructions . for more details on subdivision we refer the interested reader to the pioneering work in @xcite or to the more recent survey @xcite and the references therein . for basic details on wavelet and frame constructions see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the limit of a convergent subdivision scheme is not known analytically .",
    "nevertheless , various analytical properties of the limit can be read off the mask symbol @xmath9 which  due to the finite support of the mask  is a @xmath0-variate laurent polynomial . in the univariate",
    "setting , the properties of convergent subdivision schemes are well - understood",
    ". the symbol @xmath10 of any convergent univariate subdivision scheme possesses the : it can be written as @xmath11 for some integer @xmath12 , with the laurent polynomial @xmath13 satisfying some additional properties to ensure the convergence and smoothness of the subdivision limit , see @xcite . since the coefficients of @xmath14 sum to @xmath15 ,",
    "this factorization property tells us that convergence of the subdivision scheme implies that its mask can be written as an affine combination of shifted versions of b - spline symbols @xmath16 .",
    "thus , any reasonable univariate subdivision scheme uses b - spline symbols as its building blocks , a fact which is very crucial for designing new efficient subdivision processes , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to present results which aim at replacing the factorization property of univariate schemes by a of multivariate schemes , see theorems  a  c below . theorem  c deals with the case @xmath17 and is crucial for studying the properties of subdivision schemes .",
    "it tells us that the mask symbol of any reasonable bivariate subdivision scheme can be decomposed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and the symbols @xmath20 are laurent polynomials normalized by @xmath21 . here , @xmath22 are the normalized mask symbols of three - directional box splines , @xmath2 refers to the order of polynomial reproduction of the subdivision operator @xmath23in the wavelet literature also denoted as order of accuracy of the mask  and the list @xmath24 is as in theorem  [ thm : twodjkgen ] .",
    "the advantage of such a decomposition result is obvious , not only for the purpose of classifying the zoo of subdivision schemes , but also as a starting point for constructing new schemes or for enhancing the properties of the schemes according to specific requirements .",
    "we believe that the use of the building blocks @xmath25 in the above decomposition is the appropriate generalization to the bivariate case of the normalized univariate b - spline symbols , since @xmath25 correspond to a class of well - known bivariate spline functions whose order of global smoothness and whose order of polynomial reproduction match in the same way as in the univariate case , see the notes at the end of section  [ ssec : prop ] .",
    "we consider , therefore , this paper to be also an interesting contribution to the box spline literature .",
    "the methods employed in this paper are of algebraic nature , as well as other results on subdivision dealing with polynomial reproduction , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  6 ) .",
    "it is well - known that the necessary conditions for the convergence of a subdivision scheme are equivalent to the fact that the mask symbol @xmath26 is a properly normalized element of a certain ring of laurent polynomials : the symbol must belong to the ideal @xmath27 , or to its power @xmath28 , depending on the order @xmath2 of the polynomial reproduction of the scheme . for definitions of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , see and , or see the zero conditions of order @xmath2 in .",
    "this algebraic property of @xmath26 has been studied in detail in the papers by sauer @xcite and by mller and sauer @xcite , which also motivated us to consider these ideals once again .",
    "note that the factorization property says that @xmath26 belongs to the principal ideal generated by some b - spline symbol , while the decomposition property tells us that @xmath26 is in the ideal generated by a particular set of box spline symbols .",
    "mller and sauer have given other sets of generators for these ideals , putting the emphasis on the algebraic properties of these generators .",
    "we consider it one of our main achievements that we were able to relate the generators of the ideals @xmath28 to a well - known class of spline functions , see @xcite .",
    "box spline subdivision has been studied thoroughly in the literature , see @xcite , where such box spline schemes also appear under a different name . in the three - directional case , for example ,",
    "their mask symbols are given by @xmath30 .",
    "starting with section 2 , we restrict ourselves to working with the ideals of the ring of @xmath0-variate polynomials instead of the ring of laurent polynomials .",
    "note that any laurent polynomial can be shifted to produce a polynomial .",
    "it is done by multiplying the laurent polynomial with a factor @xmath31 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a unit in the ring of laurent polynomials .",
    "this results in a shift of the support of the mask .",
    "such a shift does neither affect the convergence and regularity of the scheme , nor does it change the zero conditions of any order .",
    "we , therefore , assume that the mask is supported in @xmath32 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 1 we introduce some notation and background on scalar subdivision schemes with dilation matrix @xmath1 . in section 2",
    "we show how the zero conditions of order @xmath33 on the mask symbol @xmath26 determine the structure of the symbol of any convergent binary subdivision scheme .",
    "this result is given in theorem  a and is a crucial step toward understanding the case @xmath34 . as in the multivariate case",
    "the factorization property is replaced by the decomposition property , it is important to reduce the number of the terms of this decomposition or , equivalently , to minimize the number of the generators for @xmath27 , see theorem  [ thm : jboxgen ] , theorem  [ thm : jboxgenmod ] .",
    "section 3 contains our main results , theorems  b and  c , dealing with powers of @xmath27 .",
    "the fact that the ideal @xmath28 is generated by the appropriate products of the elements of @xmath27 makes the proof of theorem  b straightforward , if one is not interested in reducing the number of terms of the corresponding decomposition .",
    "we address the latter issue only in the case @xmath17 , as this case is of special interest in subdivision .",
    "the corresponding result is stated in theorem  c. in section  4 we illustrate the result of theorem  c with several bivariate examples .",

    "we say that the subdivision scheme @xmath61 is convergent , if for any starting sequence @xmath62 , there exists a uniformly continuous function @xmath63 such that @xmath64 and @xmath65 for some initial data @xmath46 .",

    "theorem  a is also crucial for understanding the structure of the symbol @xmath26 satisfying condition  z@xmath80 for @xmath34 .",

    "the modified generators @xmath86 have a useful algebraic property : they factor into @xmath0 linear polynomials .    since all convergent subdivision schemes satisfy condition z@xmath79 , we start with a characterization of the polynomial ideal @xmath87 and later , in section  3 , of its powers @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",

    "thus , theorem  a explains why such affine combinations were successfully studied before , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite for examples of bivariate and univariate schemes .",
    "from the point of view of algebraic geometry , theorem  a tells us that the system of box spline symbols @xmath82 in the representation generates the ideal @xmath27 .",
