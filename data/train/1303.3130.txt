    "the recent experimental developments in the field of ultracold dipolar gases have opened up fascinating prospects for the study of systems exhibiting dipole  dipole interaction ( ddi ) @xcite .",
    "bose  einstein condensates ( becs ) of magnetic atoms have been realized using chromium @xcite , erbium @xcite , and dysprosium @xcite",
    ". however , atomic magnetic moments are small ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the bohr magneton ) , and therefore the effects of the ddi observed with these systems have remained perturbative up to now @xcite .",
    "the recent realization of the ultracold heteronuclear molecules rbk @xcite and nak @xcite , which both carry electric dipole moments of the order of @xmath3 debye , offer a promising route towards stronger ddi effects , but quantum degeneracy still remains to be achieved with these systems .",
    "rydberg atoms boast much larger dipole moments but yield challenging experimental problems associated with time and length scales @xcite .",
    "the ddi is anisotropic and long  ranged , and dipolar gases thus allow for the quantum simulation of more general hamiltonians than those accessible with non  dipolar neutral particles , whose interaction is described by the standard @xmath4wave interaction @xcite .",
    "trapping a dipolar system into lower dimensions stabilizes it with respect to two ",
    "body @xcite and many  body @xcite instabilities caused by the attractive part of the 3d ddi .",
    "this has prompted detailed studies of dipolar systems in 2d and quasi2d @xcite , bilayer @xcite , and quasi1d @xcite geometries .",
    "experiments involving dipolar bosons in optical lattices have recently been performed both with atomic becs @xcite and non  condensed dipolar molecules @xcite . up to now , their standard theoretical description has relied on the extended bose  hubbard model ( ebhm ) accounting for the interaction between nearest and more distant neighbors @xcite . the 1d ebhm has revealed the occurrence , beyond the standard mott ",
    "insulator ( mi ) and superfluid ( sf ) phases , of a mass density wave ( mdw ) phase @xcite and a haldane insulator phase @xcite .    the proper description of specific atomic systems by lattice models such as the ebhm requires a careful mapping between models and physical systems .",
    "this has already been pointed out for the hubbard model @xcite , but the non  trivial effects associated with long  range and anisotropic interactions are even more important . as a first step in this direction , we analyze the important role played by the dipolar  induced resonance ( dir ) @xcite , which is a low  energy resonance occurring when the dipole strength is varied .",
    "we show that the dir affects both the two  body and the many ",
    "body physics of the system ( see e.g.  @xcite about the bec  bcs crossover ) .    in this article",
    ", we consider a quasi1d lattice system of bosonic dipoles in the tight  binding regime @xcite .",
    "we assume that the dipole moments are aligned perpendicularly to the trap axis .",
    "in this situation , a single dir occurs .",
    "accounting for it requires going beyond the single  band ebhm .",
    "we develop a novel atom  dimer extended bose  hubbard model , which is the minimal model capturing the dir . even at this level , we find that the dir has a strong impact on the many  body phase diagram as compared to previous descriptions @xcite .    the scattering and bound  state properties of the ddi have been studied numerically for free ",
    "space models @xcite , and for 3d and 2d lattice systems @xcite . in our quasi1d geometry , we model the ddi using an effective potential obtained by averaging the transverse degrees of freedom into the harmonic  oscillator ground state @xcite : @xmath5 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the dipolar length , with @xmath7 being the dipolar strength .",
    "the range of this potential is determined by the oscillator length @xmath8 in the strongly  confined directions @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the term @xmath11 is the strength of the @xmath4wave contact interaction for a 3d scattering length @xmath12 @xcite , which can be manipulated using a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "it competes with the ddi to determine the stability and the phase of the system @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath13 unless otherwise specified . under this assumption ,",
    "( [ eq : v1d ] ) still contains a contact term proportional to @xmath14 . the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : v1d ] ) amounts to neglecting the role of confinement  induced resonances @xcite .",
    "their interplay with the dir might lead to even richer physics , which we are currently investigating .",
    "the basic building block of our many  body lattice hamiltonian ( eq .  ( [ eq : atdimebhm ] ) ) is provided by the solution of the two  body problem in a single lattice site .",
    "hence , we solve for the ground  state of two dipolar bosons in a 1d harmonic well , with the trapping frequency @xmath15 and the oscillator length @xmath16 .",
    "the center  of  mass and relative motions are decoupled , and the relative motion is governed by the hamiltonian : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the interparticle distance , @xmath19 is its conjugate momentum , and @xmath20 is the reduced mass .",

    "we seek its ground state numerically , by considering the restriction of @xmath22 onto a subspace spanned by a finite number of basis states @xmath23 .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath14 , @xmath24 supports either no bound state or a single one .",
    "the bound state is present for large enough values of @xmath14 , and its entrance coincides with the occurrence of the dir .",
    "the ` bare ' bound state supported by the attractive contact part of @xmath25 plays a key role .",
    "its wavefunction is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , and its cusp at @xmath28 can not be reproduced by projecting @xmath29 onto any finite number of harmonic oscillator eigenstates which are all smooth at @xmath28 .",
