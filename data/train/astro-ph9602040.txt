    "measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies have already had a tremendous impact on the field of cosmology .",
    "( for a review see @xcite . )",
    "future measurements promise to greatly increase this impact .",
    "new experiments will be measuring the anisotropies with increasing resolution and accuracy , and our theoretical understanding has advanced to the point where tremendous significance can be attached to these new data .",
    "recently@xcite it was realized that the degree of coherence in the perturbations at early times will be reflected in striking features in the angular power spectrum .",
    "these features should allow observations to clearly differentiate among several competing models of structure formation . as illustrated in fig [ f4plus ] ,",
    "the nature of the effect involves the degree to which the so - called `` secondary doppler peaks '' are present in the angular power spectrum .",
    "it is worth noting that various types of perturbations ( including certain `` decoherent active '' perturbations as discussed in @xcite and @xcite ) can produce secondary peaks .",
    "it is the presence or absence of these peaks that concerns us here .",
    "the purpose of this _ letter _ is to analyse the design parameters required for a satellite to determine the presence or absence of secondary doppler peaks .",
    "we first describe the fundamental methods and assumptions which are used throughout our discussion .",
    "then we step through a series of pairs of curves . in each pair ,",
    "one curve has `` standard '' secondary peaks and one does not .",
    "for each pair , we delimit the `` design parameter space '' which is able to resolve the differences between the two .",
    "our methods are the following .",
    "we work entirely in `` @xmath0 space '' , where the @xmath0 s represent the angular power spectrum of microwave anisotropies converted to an angular power spectrum using spherical harmonics in the standard way . on a case - by - case basis",
    "we consider pairs of curves @xmath0 which represent key differences one might wish to resolve .",
    "the `` design parameters '' of the experiment are represented by an effective `` beam width '' @xmath1 and pixel noise @xmath2 which are converted into the expected variance in the @xmath0 for a satellite of given fractional sky coverage @xmath3 , using an extension of the formula derived in @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the total number of pixels on the cut sky .",
    "each pixel subtends a patch of dimensions @xmath7 .",
    "we are assuming a gaussian beamshape , and hence a beam function of the form @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath9 .",
    "we model limited sky coverage by simply reducing the number of independent modes per @xmath10 by the constant factor @xmath3 for all @xmath10 .",
    "this procedure is motivated in @xcite , where the authors find the naive `` guess '' @xmath11 to be essentially correct .",
    "we emphasise that we view eqn [ eqn1 ] as a simple tool for generating realistic variances for the @xmath0 s as a function of the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath12 , and @xmath3 . how these effective parameters are related to the fundamental design parameters of a given satellite involves understanding specific problems such as the process of foreground subtraction .",
    "we do not deal with these issues here .",
    "technically , the independent modes @xmath13 which contribute to the @xmath0 s are only orthogonal when considering the whole sky . the orthogonal functions for a partial sky ( besides being fewer , as already discussed ) will tend to get contributions from several @xmath13 s .",
    "we expect this fact not to invalidate the rough arguments below for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , a major factor in the whole procedure is counting up the right number of independent modes .",
    "the factor @xmath3 in eqn [ eqn1 ] ensures that we are doing this correctly ( at least for large @xmath10 ) .",
    "secondly , for reasonably large sky coverage only a handful of nearby @xmath10 s would be mixed to form the true orthogonal functions , and since the @xmath0 s ( and the error bars ) are not too rapidly varying with @xmath10 , we expect the error bars on the true orthogonal functions to be well estimated by those of the related @xmath0 s . finally , although the first two arguments probably break down for low values of @xmath10 , the results presented here do not depend crucially on what is happening at low @xmath10 , so we expect overall not to be making any serious errors .",
    "we are trying to address the question : `` given two theoretical curves f(l ) and g(l ) , which part of parameter space contains the experiments which can confidently distinguish between them ? '' . to quantify this",
    "we calculate the `` distance '' @xmath14 between the two curves as @xmath15 using the errors as constructed above . under the assumption of near - gaussianity , @xmath14 will be nearly @xmath16-distributed and we can estimate the confidence @xmath17 with which the curves can be distinguished for this particular experiment , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the incomplete gamma function .",
    "we then find a sharp boundary in parameter space between a region of nearly certain distinguishability and a region where experiments fail to distinguish the two curves .",
    "these are plotted in the top panels of figs 2 - 5 . in regions above the heavy curve ,",
    "there is greater than @xmath20 probability of confusing the two curves , and below the curve there is less than @xmath21 probability of confusion .",
    "note that the @xmath22 coordinate in the top panel is noise ( in @xmath23 ) per unit @xmath1 , where @xmath1 ( in arc minutes ) is the @xmath24 coordinate . in each of figs 2 - 5",
    "the lower panel shows the two curves used , as well as the error bars associate with the point indicated with a @xmath25 in the upper panel .",
    "( the @xmath24 axis is in units of @xmath26 . )      in this _ letter _",
    "we take the view that there are very strong reasons to go for maximum sky coverage . as well as",
    "investigating the low @xmath10 behaviour of the @xmath0 s , a single satellite will allow a wide range of scales to be studied . even though individual ground based experiments can pin down a rather narrow range of smaller angular scales , piecing several such results together into a coherent picture",
    "can be tricky , not the least because of the need to get the correct relative normalisation . as we discuss below",
    ", the range of possible angular power spectra is quite varied , and we regard the coherent picture which only a satellite can produce to be essential to extracting clear cosmological information from the cmb . for example , in @xcite magueijo and hobson argue that a long duration low sky coverage interferometry experiment would give a simple way to detect the secondary peaks in fig 2 , but such an experiment would be unable to differentiate the curves in fig 5 .    throughout this _",
    "letter _ , we take the sky fraction @xmath27 .",
    "this seems to be a reasonable `` maximum '' sky coverage which avoids excessive foreground contamination . as a consequence of large sky coverage ,",
    "one obtains a large number of independent data points at small angular scales .",
    "this adds to the ability of the satellite to resolve the secondary peaks , and is the origin of the sharp contrast we find between the `` resolving '' and `` non - resolving regions '' .",
    "as we have already seen in fig [ f4plus ] a given low - coherence theoretical model ( such as cosmic strings ) may well have an angular power spectrum which differs from `` similar '' high coherence model on _ all _ scales .",
    "figure [ c1 ] shows the case of two similar curves , one with and one without secondary oscillations . clearly these curves are sufficiently different to allow a large ( but still limited ) range of experiments to distinguish between them .    however , we are faced with several theoretical uncertainties which would allow coherent and decoherent model builders to fit the data once it has come in .",
    "cosmic string models are relatively unconstrained at low @xmath10 .",
    "even after these have been pinned down , there will be a wide range of different types of `` decoherent '' models based , for example , on different types of cosmic defects .",
    "uncertainties about the details of the inflaton potential will continue to add flexibility to inflationary predictions .",
    "both scenarios are affected by the uncertainties in the values of cosmological parameters such as @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , as well as uncertainties in the ionization history .",
    "the fact that the primary peak can occur in the same position for defect and inflation models with different @xmath28 generates a further degeneracy .",
    "one of the exciting opportunities offered by the coherence issue is that by searching for secondary doppler peaks one can have an impact on theoretical cosmology which transcends these uncertainties .    in what follows ,",
    "we step through a series of pairs of curves , each illustrating the kind of pressure that searching for secondary peaks can put on satellite design . in each case , one of the curves has no secondary peaks , and is forced to match the other ( oscillating ) curve to varying degrees .",
    "many of these curves are constructed `` by hand '' , rather than being calculated from a particular detailed model .",
    "we feel that the prevailing theoretical uncertainties justify this approach . in fig [ c2 ]",
    "we have forced the two curves from fig [ c1 ] to match exactly at low @xmath10 .",
    "much higher resolution experiments are required to resolve the difference between these two curves , since the differences emerge only in the high @xmath10 region .    in fig [ c18 ] , we have made a further modification of the curves in fig [ c2 ] so that the curve with no secondary oscillations tracks the inflation curve as much as possible .",
    "the useful region in satellite parameter space is reduced even further .",
    "cosmic string models tend to produce primary peaks at rather small angular scales , so it is not surprising that looking for the secondary oscillations makes high demands on the resolution .",
    "suppose however , that the position of the primary peak is at the larger angular scale indicated in the standard @xmath32 cdm model .",
    "one would still want to search for the presence of secondary peaks , as a test for coherence .",
    "figure [ c17 ] shows that even for this case the resolution required to test for secondary oscillations is considerable .",
    "note that the experiment indicated by the @xmath25 can easily resolve the primary peak , but is unable to investigate the presence of secondary oscillations .",
    "the search for secondary oscillation in the cmb angular power spectrum holds a deep significance for the field of cosmology .",
    "we have argued that a thorough search requires a satellite with sufficient resolution .",
    "the main point of this _ letter _ is to make sure that such a satellite gets built .",
    "there are four satellite proposals presently under consideration and we outline their resolving power here .",
    "it is not trivial to translate the realistic error bars ( after eg foreground subtraction ) into the two parameters used here .",
    "still , @xcite suggests that the `` fire '' satellite can be roughly described by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and psi by @xmath35 and @xmath36 of these two , the lower resolution error bars ( psi ) appear on fig [ c18 ] ( the figure which places the greatest demands on satellite design ) .",
    "we conclude that both of these experiments would be effective in searching for secondary oscillations .",
    "( the psi experiment is actually rather close to the edge of the `` resolving '' region . )",
    "the cobras / samba proposal has been analysed in @xcite .",
    "even the most pessimistic analysis from @xcite implies an even greater resolving power than that of psi or fire .",
    "the design parameters for the fourth proposal , map@xcite , are not public information .",
    "the presence or absence of secondary doppler peaks in the cmb power spectrum is of fundamental interest .",
    "our analysis emphasizes small beamwidth as a crucial design parameter for their detection , and thus strengthens the case for a high resolution cmb satellite .",
