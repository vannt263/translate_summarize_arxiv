    "the relative time - of - flight ( tof ) for showers can also be measured with the emcal with a timing resolution of about @xmath72  ns for the present data .",
    "this measurement can be used to reduce the contribution from hadrons and other backgrounds that are out of time from the expected arrival for a photon .      to record a significant sample of events containing a or meson with large transverse momentum ( @xmath52 ) , a high energy photon trigger is used .",
    "a trigger tile is defined as a @xmath73 array of emcal towers , and , for the present analysis , the energy in a @xmath73 array of tiles ( or @xmath74 towers ) is summed and compared to the trigger threshold . to reduce loss at the edge of a tile , these groups of @xmath74 towers overlap . for this analysis",
    ", we use two trigger thresholds , one at 1.4  gev and one at 2.1  gev . for diphoton decays , these are maximally efficient at parent meson energies of @xmath75  gev and @xmath76  gev , respectively . since the reset time of the trigger , @xmath77 140  ns , is longer than the @xmath77 106  ns between bunches , two separate trigger circuits are used to read out even and odd - numbered crossings .",

    "each arm has 64 quartz crystal erenkov radiators attached to photomultiplier tubes .",
    "the bbc also functions as the minimum - bias ( mb ) collision trigger for this dataset , with a requirement that at least one photomultiplier tube fire in each arm and that the timing of the hits reconstructs to a collision with a @xmath81-vertex within 30  cm of the nominal ip .",
    "the yield of mb triggers in crossings where the data acquisition system was ready to take data was used to determine the luminosity .",
    "the second luminosity monitor , the zero - degree calorimeter ( zdc )  @xcite , comprises two arms located @xmath82  m from the ip along the beam axis , covering @xmath83 . each arm is composed of three sections of hadron calorimeter composed of optical fibers for erenkov sampling sandwiched between layers of tungsten absorber .",
    "the three sections constitute a total of 5 nuclear interaction lengths . as the arms lie beyond the bending magnets , which serve to separate the two beams outside the experimental area but",
    "also sweep away charged particles from the interaction , the zdc primarily triggers on neutrals .",
    "a zdc trigger requires a minimum energy deposit in each arm of nominally 20  gev .",
    "the measurements require longitudinal polarization .",
    "four spin rotator magnets ( two in each ring ) located outside of the phenix interaction region rotate the beam polarization from the stable vertical direction to the longitudinal direction before the ip and back to vertical afterward .",
    "a position - sensitive shower - maximum detector , composed of vertical and horizontal scintillator strips , is located between the first and second sections in each zdc arm .",
    "it is used in conjunction with the zdc to measure an azimuthal asymmetry in forward neutron production with a magnitude of 0.07  @xcite during transverse polarization running ( with the spin rotators turned off ) .",
    "this asymmetry should vanish when the beam polarization vector is perfectly longitudinal .",
    "the size of the residual asymmetry can therefore be used to determine the remaining transverse component , and thus the degree of effective longitudinal polarization . in 2009 at @xmath55  gev , the fraction of the polarization along the longitudinal direction in the blue beam was @xmath84 and in the yellow beam @xmath85 .",
    "events used in this analysis require a mb trigger in coincidence with a high energy trigger in the emcal .",

    "clusters centered on towers that are markedly noisy or dead , or centered on towers neighboring a markedly noisy or dead tower , are discarded .",
    "clusters centered within two towers of the edge of each emcal sector s acceptance are also excluded .",

    "the distribution among towers of the total energy deposited is compared with the expected distribution for an electromagnetic shower , based on results from test beam data .",
    "the resulting cut is 98% efficient for photons .",
    "the other two cuts are discussed in more detail below .    also of concern",
    "is background of clusters from previous events ; since they can be from crossings with a different bunch helicity combination , the asymmetries are affected .",
    "photons from meson decays in previous events are effectively removed by the trigger requirement described in section  [ ss : meson_sel ] .",
    "the tof cut is effective in targeting the remaining clusters of this type .",
    "one method to remove charged hadrons is to veto photon candidates with associated ( charged particle ) hits in the pc3 .",
    "however , to not unnecessarily remove real photons that pair - converted before the emcal , but outside of the magnetic field , a two - sided cut was developed .     from three particle classes , which leave clusters in the emcal ( solid grid behind pc3 ) : ( a ) photons that convert outside of the magnetic field prior to the emcal , and have very small @xmath87 , ( b ) charged hadrons that bend in the magnetic field , and so have moderate sized @xmath87 , and ( c ) photons that do not convert , and",

    "thus we should retain clusters with small @xmath87 .",

    "thus there will be some energy - dependent @xmath87 region associated with these particles which can be used to exclude them from the analysis .",

    "[ f : theta_cv_window ] for clusters in the pbsc with energies below @xmath95  gev , above which the deflection of charged hadrons in the magnetic field becomes too small to make a clear separation in @xmath87 . due to the decreased response of the pbgl to hadrons ,",
    "no additional benefit for the charge veto cut on top of the other cuts was found and the charge veto cut was not applied .",
    "in contrast , when selecting on pbsc clusters with energy @xmath96  gev , the charge veto cut improved the statistical uncertainty on @xmath94 in the 11.5  gev/@xmath31@xmath52 bin by @xmath97 when applied on top of all other cluster cuts .",

    "[ f : theta_cv_yields ] for different @xmath87 requirements .",
    "it is clear that the signal to background ratio for the meson is significantly smaller for clusters with a moderate @xmath87 , due to hadron contamination in the photon candidates .",

    "the effect of this mass shift was studied and found to have a negligible impact on the final asymmetries .      a particular hardware - based effect that became apparent with increases in the instantaneous luminosities delivered to the experiments in 2009 involved the readout electronics for the emcal .",
    "when the trigger fires , the signal in each emcal tower is compared with an analog - buffered value from 424 ns , or four crossings , earlier . due to the long decay time of an emcal signal , any energy deposit occurring in the three previous crossings is read out .",
    "pileup is negligible due to the fine lateral segmentation of the emcal , so only the combinatorial background is affected . in the 2009 run ,",
    "the likelihood for a collision in at least one of three previous crossings was significant at about @xmath98 .",
    "one cut in particular that can reduce this effect is the tof cut .",
    "the tof for a given emcal cluster is given relative to @xmath99 , the initial time of the collision as measured by the bbc .",
    "photon candidates in this analysis are required to reach the emcal within @xmath100  ns of the expected tof for a photon , which removes low energy hadrons and other out of time clusters but also reduces the contribution of clusters from previous crossings .",
    "although the circular buffering in the emcal readout makes the tof measurement insensitive to timing offsets that are multiples of the beam - crossing period , the fact that different crossings have independent @xmath99 effectively smears the tof distribution .",
    "this is the dominant effect in increasing the likelihood of previous - crossing clusters to have a tof outside the cut window .",
    "this background can be studied in more detail by analyzing specific sets of crossings that follow one- or two - bunch empty crossings and therefore contain a smaller number of previous - crossing clusters .",
    "we define the following crossing selections for study based on the number of previous crossings that can contribute clusters given a four - crossing ( current plus three ) memory :    * @xmath101 : the three previous crossings are empty * @xmath102 : one of the three previous crossings is filled * @xmath103 : two of the three previous crossings are filled * @xmath104 : all three previous crossings are filled . *",

    "figure [ f : emcalmemory_with_tof_cut ] shows the efficiency of ( fraction of events passing ) the tof cut on the various selections .",
    "the efficiency decreases as the selection moves away from the empty crossings and the previous - crossing cluster background increases , indicating that the tof cut is more effective at removing this specific type of background than the total background .",
    "also , from selection @xmath101 to @xmath104 , the relative efficiency in the peak region decreases by about @xmath106 compared to a decrease of roughly @xmath107 in the high mass background efficiency .",
    "the smaller change for the peak region is due to the trigger cut ( see next section ) removing true mesons from previous crossings .",
    "as expected , there is no significant change in cut efficiency between selections @xmath104 and @xmath105 since the buffer encompasses only three previous crossings .",
