    "research on plane couette flow has long been hampered by the absence of states intermediate in complexity between laminar plane couette flow and three - dimensional turbulence .",
    "intermediate states can be created , however , if a thin wire oriented in the spanwise direction is inserted in an experimental setup @xcite .",
    "no longer subject to squire s theorem , this perturbed configuration undergoes a bifurcation to a three - dimensional steady or quasi - steady state .",
    "the 3d states contain vortices oriented in the streamwise direction and of finite streamwise extent , localized around the ribbon . as the wire radius is reduced , the reynolds number threshold for the bifurcation and the streamwise extent occupied by the vortices increase , while the range of reynolds numbers over which the 3d steady states exist decreases .",
    "we have carried out a numerical study corresponding to the experiments of @xcite , focusing primarily on the largest wire radius used . in a previous study @xcite",
    ", we carried out a linear and weakly nonlinear stability analysis of this configuration . here , we present a detailed bifurcation diagram for this case .",
    "our calculations show a rich bifurcation structure with many types of solutions : stable and unstable ; steady , periodic , and aperiodic ; and of different symmetries .",
    "some of these solutions persist as the wire radius is reduced .",
    "the time - dependent navier - stokes equations have been solved using the spectral element code prism @xcite written by henderson . instead of a wire , we have used a ribbon of infinitesimal streamwise ( @xmath3 ) extent whose cross - channel ( @xmath4 ) height is taken equal to the diameter of the wire and whose length in the homogeneous transverse ( @xmath5 ) direction is infinite . for most of the current study",
    "the computational domain is @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 where @xmath9 is approximately the numerically determined critical wavelength .",
    "periodic boundary conditions have been imposed at @xmath10 and at @xmath11 and no - slip conditions at the channel walls @xmath12 and at the ribbon @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the ratio @xmath15 of the ribbon height to that of the channel is set to @xmath16 except where otherwise specified . in the @xmath17 directions , we use @xmath18 computational elements ,",
    "each of which is covered by a grid of @xmath19 collocation points or interpolating polynomials . in the @xmath5 direction ,",
    "we use 32 fourier modes or gridpoints .",
    "( simulations were also conducted in a reduced spanwise domain @xmath20 with 16 fourier modes . )",
    "this leads to a total of 143840 gridpoints or basis functions per velocity component . to compute each asymptotic state required between 500 and 10000 nondimensional time units ( i.e. units of channel width / velocity difference ) , which in turn required between 3 and 60 cpu hours on each of 16 processors of a cray t3e .",
    "some tests of the adequacy of our numerical resolution and streamwise domain size are reported in @xcite .",
    "the resolution for complex three - dimensional flows has been checked by increasing the polynomial order from 7 to 11 and the number of fourier modes from 32 to 64 .",
    "figure [ combined ] shows @xmath21 , the energy in the @xmath5-dependent modes for all the steady states we have calculated for @xmath22 , and serves as a bifurcation diagram .",
    "each branch is distinguished by its symmetry .",
    "the geometry and basic 2d flow have o(2 ) symmetry in the periodic spanwise direction @xmath5 , i.e. translations @xmath23 and reflections @xmath24 , in the @xmath17 plane , they have centrosymmetry @xmath25 .",
    "the 2d branch loses stability via a circle pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath26 , breaking the translation symmetry in @xmath5 .",
    "the critical spanwise wavelength is approximately @xmath27 and the critical wavenumber @xmath28 .",
    "the circle pitchfork bifurcation is subcritical , and so the 3d states created branch leftwards and are unstable ; we can not calculate them with the methods used here .",
    "these states have reflection symmetry in @xmath5 and centro - symmetry in @xmath17 ; we call them 3d symmetric states",
    ". the centro - symmetry can visualized as follows : at the ribbon location at @xmath13 , four small vortices are present .",
    "the upper two vortices persist for @xmath29 , while the lower two persist for @xmath30 .    the 3d branch changes direction and is stabilized by a saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath31 .",
    "its stability is short - lived , however , lasting only until a pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath32 .",
    "the pitchfork bifurcation creates new stable branches with only the pointwise symmetry @xmath33 ; we call these 3d asymmetric states",
    ". figure [ 240 ] illustrates this symmetry breaking by showing two different velocity fields at @xmath34 .",
    "the symmetric 3d field on the left has two different reflection symmetries , satisfying both @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the asymmetric 3d field on the right satisfies only the single reflection symmetry @xmath37 .",
    "the difference between symmetric and asymmetric 3d fields can also be seen in figure  [ r350y ] discussed below .",
    "although the symmetric 3d branch is unstable , we can continue to calculate it by imposing reflection symmetry in @xmath5 .",
    "it is further destabilized , however , by a hopf bifurcation at @xmath38 , beyond which we have not followed it .",
    "the asymmetric 3d branches change direction and are destabilized by a second saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath39 .",
    "surprisingly , time - dependent simulation at @xmath40 from an initial asymmetric state at @xmath41 leads to a metastable state with half the imposed wavelength of @xmath27 , or equivalently , twice the wavenumber of @xmath42 . the evolution in time of the energies @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the @xmath45 and @xmath46 spanwise fourier components is shown in figure [ timeseries ] .",
    "the initial field at @xmath41 and the metastable state at @xmath40 are shown in figure [ 400 - 450 ] .",
    "this transition is _ symmetry - restoring _ since the field is invariant under translation in @xmath5 by @xmath47 .",
    "the metastable state persists during @xmath48 , when @xmath43 is near zero .",
    "the metastable state is the @xmath47 branch created from the 2d branch by a circle pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath49 ; see figure [ combined ] .",
    "calculations show that it branches rightwards .",
    "each of the two halves of the field is symmetric under reflection in @xmath5 about its midplane @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath47 branch undergoes another pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath52 , analogous to that undergone at @xmath53 , creating branches which do not have this reflection symmetry . from figure",
    "[ 400 - 450 ] , it can be seen that the vortices in the @xmath47 field remain somewhat circular ; their cross - channel height is reduced along with their spanwise extent .",
    "the absence of vortices near the upper and lower walls could indicate that the streamwise velocity profile is more stable in this region than that near the center .",
    "when the @xmath47 branch is created at @xmath54 , it is necessarily unstable to wavelength doubling in a domain of size @xmath55 , because its parent 2d branch is already unstable to @xmath55 modes .",
    "we are able to calculate the @xmath47 branch from its creation at @xmath54 ( and , for @xmath56 , its asymmetric version ) by using a domain of size @xmath47 .",
    "however , we emphasize that during its appearance as a metastable state , it is calculated in the full domain of size @xmath55 , i.e. it has been stabilized to wavelength doubling .",
    "we propose a possible mechanism for this stabilization : at @xmath57 , the asymmetric @xmath55 branches change direction and stability .",
    "if the unstable asymmetric @xmath55 branches terminate on the symmetric @xmath47 branch in a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation @xmath58 , then the symmetric @xmath47 branch will be stabilized to @xmath55 perturbations for @xmath59 , as will the asymmetric @xmath47 branch for @xmath56 .",
    "however , this bifurcation scenario sheds no light on the subsequent evolution from the metastable @xmath47 state to irregular oscillations , as shown in figure [ timeseries ] for @xmath60 .",
    "irregular oscillations persist when the reynolds number is reduced until @xmath61 , where the flow reverts to the steady asymmetric @xmath55 branch .",
    "we believe these states to correspond essentially to the turbulent flow observed in unperturbed plane couette flow for @xmath62 @xcite , both because of the closeness of the lower bound in reynolds number , and because of their appearance and streamwise extent ( see figure  [ r350y ] ) .",
    "because lack of resolution can produce spurious time dependence , we have verified that these dynamics persist with increased numerical resolution .",
    "figure [ events ] shows the evolution of the energy @xmath63 and @xmath43 in the zero and @xmath45 spanwise fourier components at @xmath64 .",
    "turbulent states at @xmath64 are illustrated via streamwise velocity contours in figures [ r350y ] and [ r350z ] .",
    "figure [ r350y ] shows the symmetric , asymmetric , and @xmath47 steady states , in the @xmath65 midplane ( @xmath66 ) , as well as two instantaneous snapshots of turbulent states @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath43 is locally maximal and minimal , respectively ( see figure [ events ] ) .",
    "figure [ r350z ] shows the asymmetric steady state and two instantaneous snapshots of turbulent states at @xmath67 , 630 in the @xmath17 midplane ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the deviation from plane couette flow is highly localized around the wire at @xmath13 for the steady states , but extends over the entire streamwise domain for the turbulent states .    in the experiments @xcite , streamwise vortices",
    "are observed for @xmath70 , compared to our threshold of @xmath71 .",
    "their wavelengths are between 5.2 and 5.7 , as compared with our critical @xmath72 .",
    "intermittency is observed experimentally for @xmath73 and turbulence for @xmath74 , in close agreement with our observation of @xmath75 .",
    "spatial period - halving events are also observed in the experiments @xcite , as in our transition from the @xmath55 to the @xmath47 metastable state .",
    "this period - halving transition should be amenable to bifurcation - theoretic analysis .",
    "an important question is the dependence of this scenario on ribbon height @xmath15 .",
    "results from calculations performed for two smaller heights , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , are given in table [ rhodep ] .",
    "for both of these ribbon heights , the 2d flow undergoes a circle pitchfork bifurcation to a 3d eigenmode . because the critical wavenumber , denoted by @xmath78 , changes very little with @xmath15 , we have given more precise values for @xmath79 in table [ rhodep ] in order to specify the @xmath15 dependence . the fact that @xmath78 is relatively insensitive to @xmath15 provides evidence for the idea that this instability arises from the underlying unperturbed plane couette flow rather than depending sensitively on the perturbing ribbon .",
    "( we have used the same domain with spanwise periodicity @xmath80 to calculate all secondary bifurcations . ) the critical reynolds number @xmath81 increases as @xmath15 decreases , as expected from the absence of linear instability at finite @xmath82 for plane couette flow .",
    "both aspects of the @xmath15-dependence of the transition to three dimensionality are also observed in the experiments .    for @xmath76 ,",
    "the bifurcation scenario is similar to that at @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath83 increases more slowly as @xmath15 decreases than does @xmath81 , lending support to the hypothesis that branches of steady 3d states might continue to exist as @xmath15 approaches zero , although disconnected from the 2d branch .",
    "however , @xmath57 decreases , so that the reynolds number range over which _ stable _",
    "steady 3d states exist is smaller , as is also observed experimentally . specifically , the branch of unstable 3d states bifurcating subcritically from the 2d flow occupies the reynolds number range @xmath84 , which increases from 31 for @xmath16 to 65 for @xmath76 , while the branches of stable 3d states occupy the reynolds number range @xmath85 which decreases from 223 for @xmath16 to 147 for @xmath76 .",
    "we note that @xcite and @xcite have attempted to compute steady states of plane couette flow containing streamwise vortices by continuing taylor vortex flow . in the plane couette flow limit , they find that the solutions which persist are analogues of wavy taylor vortex flow , here streamwise traveling waves , and exist for @xmath86 .    for @xmath87 , we have been unable to find any stable steady 3d states , despite extensive searching .",
    "thus table [ rhodep ] lists only the primary instability @xmath81 and @xmath78 for @xmath88 .",
    "we observe irregular oscillations for all the initial conditions , reynolds numbers , and spatial resolutions we have tried .",
    "this is in contrast to the experiments @xcite , in which approximately steady states containing streamwise vortices are observed for @xmath15 even smaller than 0.043 .",
    "calculations at intermediate ribbon heights would clarify whether , when , and how the stable steady 3d states disappear as @xmath15 is reduced .",
    ".dependence of bifurcations on ribbon height @xmath15 .",
    "see figure [ combined ] and text for description of bifurcation sequence .",
