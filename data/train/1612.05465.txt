    "debris discs represent the final stage of the planet formation process .",
    "the dust observed in these systems is thought to be replenished through collisions between solid bodies @xcite , and are therefore expected to be gas depleted .",
    "however , a few debris discs show the presence of small amounts of circumstellar gas . whether this gas is remnant of the early disc stages ( primordial ) or of secondary origin ( e.g. brought to the gas phase by photodesorption or by cometary activity ) is a matter of contemporary debate @xcite .",
    "circumstellar gas was first discovered around @xmath1  pictoris over 40 years ago when @xcite noticed the presence of narrow ca  ii absorption lines located at the centre of @xmath1  pic photospheric lines .",
    "subsequent to the first imaging of the debris disc around @xmath1  pic by @xcite , @xcite observed similar features both in ca  ii and na  i. the radial velocities of the absorptions coincided with the radial velocity of the star , and were attributed to circumstellar gas orbiting the star .",
    "variable absorption features have been indentified , attributed to the evaporation of solid kilometer - sized bodies falling into the star @xcite .",
    "over a dozen other debris discs with circumstellar gas absorption features have been indentified with this method , such as hr  10 @xcite , hd  32297 @xcite , 49  ceti @xcite , hd  172555 @xcite , hd  21620 , hd  110411 , hd  145964 , hd  183324 @xcite , and @xmath2  leo @xcite . detecting gas in discs using absorption lines",
    "is difficult since the gas disc must be favorably oriented close to edge - on in order to be detected . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantage of this method is that it is sensitive to much lower gas column densities compared to direct observations of gas emission .    in this work",
    "we study the optical spectra of 16 debris disc host stars in order to search for gas - bearing @xmath1 pictoris - like systems .",
    "one of the main difficulties of this technique is to rule out interstellar ( is ) absorption features , which may be very similar in profiles and strength to circumstellar lines .",
    "this requires careful analysis of the line characteristics @xcite .",
    "the sample consists of 16 debris disc host stars taken from the catalogue of @xcite having spectral types ranging from b8 to f7 ( as listed in the michigan spectral catalog for southern stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sample was selected in terms of their low dust fractional luminosities , with all stars having l@xmath3/l@xmath4 values less than those investigated by @xcite being selected in order to choose true debris discs .",
    "dust fractional luminosities were computed by fitting a black - body to the observed spectral energy distributions ( sed ) .",
    "the stellar seds were approximated using templates from the library of stellar atmospheres by @xcite , for models with @xmath5 and solar metallicity .",
    "figure  [ seds ] shows the results from the sed fitting routine , where both the observed sed and the fitted _ stellar + dust blackbody model _ model are plotted .",
    "l@xmath6/l@xmath4 values in our sample are found to range between 1.8@xmath7 and 7.5@xmath8 .",
    "we estimate our method to be accurate to factors of 2 - 3 by comparing our @xmath9/@xmath10 results with values already published in the literature @xcite .    based on their dust fractional luminosities ,",
    "these systems are expected to be in a more advanced evolutionary stage than the sample studied by @xcite .",
    "all stars have _ hipparcos _ distances available @xcite .",
    "spectral standards of three spectral types were also observed in order to allow for spectral classification and removal of telluric absorption lines .",
    "table  [ sample ] summarizes the properties of our sample , where we have listed the properties of our observed target sample along with those of the 3 observed spectral standards ( hr  5558 , hr  5670 and hr  6045 ) .",
    "optical echelle spectroscopy of the 16 debris disc host stars was obtained using the ucl echelle spectrogaph ( ucles ) at the 3.9 meter anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "all observations were taken on the night of may 20@xmath11 2000 .",
    "a log of the observations is given in table  [ log ] , including the slit - width and seeing values .",
    "the 31.6  g / mm grating was used in conjunction with the mit / ll  ccd .",
    "observations were carried out with two wavelength settings in order to cover the blue region of the spectra between 3834 - 5440  @xmath12 , and between 5550 - 9900  @xmath12 in the red .",
    "the red observations were optimized for the study of h@xmath13 , he   i and the na  i d - lines , whilst the blue exposures covered the ca  ii k and h lines as well as several metallic lines in the 4000 - 5000  @xmath12 region .",
    "the spectral resolution , estimated from measuring the @xmath14 of thorium - argon arc lines , was 0.115  @xmath12 ( @xmath15 km s@xmath16 ) at ca  ii k ( 3933.663 @xmath12 ) , corresponding to a resolving power of @xmath17 .",
    "at the location of the na  i d - lines , in the red part of the spectrum ( 5889.951  @xmath12 ) , the spectral resolution and resolving power were found to be 0.171  @xmath12 and @xmath18 respectively .",

    "the lack of known interstellar absorption features within the velocity ranges of the lines seen in both hd  75416 and hd  166841 ( which coincide with the stellar velocities ) leaves open the question of the nature of these features .",
    "hd  75416 ( @xmath25  cha ) is known to host an evolved protoplanetary disk , possibly transitioning into the debris disk phase @xcite .",
    "re - observation of these two sources in order to search for variability , together with observations of stars in adjacent lines of sight , could help to disentangle the origin of these features .",
    "the non - detection of atomic gas absorption towards the co - rich hd  181237 debris disc system is consistent with this system being seen close to pole - on @xcite .",
    "the most compelling evidence for a circumstellar gas is seen in one of the two velocity components of the absorption seen in the spectrum of hd  110058 ( at + 12  km  s@xmath16 ) .",
    "the good agreement with the stellar velocity , the ca  ii / na  i column density ratio close to unity , the lack of known interstellar clouds or shells at the correct velocities in hd  110058 s direction , and the fact that the disc is observed close to edge - on strongly suggest that the absorption is caused by atomic gas present in hd  110058 s disc .",
    "the additional mike data provides compelling evidence that the component at + 12  km  s@xmath16 arises in the circumstellar environment of hd  110058 .",
    "the detection of optical absorption gas features towards hd  110058 , adds to the many similiarities with the @xmath1 pic system ( age , dust fractional luminosity , orientation , and presence of both atomic and molecurlar gas ) . in the latter ,",
    "the gas is believed to be of secondary origin , i.e. produced by the release of atomic and molecular species by volatile - rich bodies @xcite .",
    "future studies of this new @xmath1 pic - like system could provide further information on the origins of gas in debris discs .",
