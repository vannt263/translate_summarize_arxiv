    "the exponential increase in the demand for mobile data traffic imposes great challenge on the cellular network . in recent years",
    ", a heightened attention has been focused on massive multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) systems , in which each base station ( bs ) is equipped with hundreds of antennas and serves tens of or more users simultaneously @xcite-@xcite . because the large number of bs antennas can effectively average out noise , fading and to some extent , noncoherent interference , massive mimo achieves significant gains in both spectral efficiency and radiated energy efficiency , and",
    "thus is envisioned as a promising key enabler for the next generation cellular network @xcite-@xcite .",
    "thus far , most of the literature on massive mimo assume a conventional architecture built on ideal hardware .",
    "however , this assumption is not well justified , since the hardware cost and circuit power consumption scale linearly with the number of bs antennas and thus soon become practically unbearable unless low - cost , energy - efficient hardware is deployed which however easily suffers from impairments . assuming an additive stochastic impairment model , the authors of @xcite examined the impact of hardware impairments on both spectral efficiency and radiated energy efficiency of massive mimo .",
    "the authors of @xcite obtained scaling law that describes how fast the tolerance level of impairments increases with the number of bs antennas while reaping much of the performance gain promised by massive mimo .",
    "the authors of @xcite examined the accuracy of widely used additive or multiplicative stochastic impairment models by providing a hardware - specific deterministic model and performing comparative numerical studies .    due to the favorable property of low cost , low power consumption and feasibility of implementation @xcite-@xcite , low - resolution analog - to - digital converters ( adcs )",
    "have also attracted ubiquitous attention in the field of energy - efficient design for wireless communication systems . for nyquist - sampled real gaussian channel ,",
    "the authors of @xcite established some general results regarding low - resolution quantization , showing that for a quantizer with @xmath0 bins , the capacity - achieving input alphabet should be discrete and needs not have more than @xmath0 mass points .",
    "the authors of @xcite designed a modified minimum mean square error ( mmse ) receiver for mimo systems with output quantization and proposed a lower bound to the capacity . in @xcite , the authors investigated a practical monobit digital receiver paradigm for impulse radio ultra - wideband ( uwb ) systems .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite examined the impact of one - bit quantization on achievable rates of massive mimo systems with both perfect and estimated channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite addressed the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) capacities of both single input multiple output ( simo ) and mimo channels with one - bit output quantization .    despite its great superiority in deployment cost and energy efficiency ,",
    "one - bit quantization generally has to tolerate large rate loss , especially in the high snr regime @xcite , thus highlighting the indispensability of high - resolution adc for digital receiver . besides , the great overhead of pilot - aided channel estimation under one - bit quantization is also a big concern @xcite-@xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus motivated by such consideration , in this paper we propose a mixed - adc architecture for massive mimo systems in which one - bit adcs partially , but not completely , replace conventionally assumed high - resolution adcs .",
    "this architecture has the potential of allowing us to remarkably reduce the hardware cost and power consumption while still maintain a large fraction of the performance gains promised by conventional architecture .    for such mixed - adc massive mimo , although the channel capacity is still the maximum mutual information between the channel input and the quantized channel output vector , from an engineering perspective , however , the mutual information maximization problem appears to be not completely satisfactory in providing engineering insights . because in this situation , the mutual information is high - dimensional integration and summation which do not yield closed - form simplification as in linear gaussian channels .",
    "generalized mutual information ( gmi ) @xcite-@xcite , on the other hand , allows one to analytically characterize the achievable date rates of low - complexity linear receivers that are particularly favorable for massive mimo systems , and thus we leverage it to address the performance of the mixed - adc architecture . as a performance metric for mismatched decoding , gmi has proved convenient and useful in several important scenarios such as fading channels with imperfect csi at the receiver @xcite , channels with transceiver distortion @xcite-@xcite and analysis of bit - interleaved coded modulation @xcite .    exploiting a general analytical framework developed in @xcite",
    ", we obtain a series of analytical results .",
    "first , we consider a fixed simo channel where the bs is equipped with @xmath1 antennas but only has access to @xmath2 pairs of high - resolution adcs and @xmath3 pairs of one - bit adcs , and derive a closed - form expression of the gmi .",
    "this enables us to optimize the linear combiner and further explore the asymptotic behaviors of the gmi in both low and high snr regimes that in turn suggest a plausible adc switch scheme .",
    "besides , the benefit of dithering is also investigated , for which we propose a simple but effective dithering scheme , which achieves remarkable rate gain , especially for the case of small @xmath2 .",
    "the analysis is then extended to the scenario of ergodic fading channels where , instead of directly working with the exact gmi , we derive lower and upper bounds of the gmi , which are shown to be very tight by numerical study .",
    "moreover , numerical results reveal that the mixed - adc architecture with a small number of high - resolution adcs suffices to attain a large portion of the channel capacity of conventional architecture and meanwhile outperforms antenna selection with the same number of high - resolution adcs ideal rf chains available at the bs . ] . the robustness of the mixed - adc architecture against imperfect csi is also investigated . in this paper",
    ", we only utilize the high - resolution adcs to perform channel estimation , and thus the deduced estimation error is gaussian distributed in rayleigh fading channels , allowing us to analytically characterize the resulting gmi as well as its lower and upper bounds .",
    "numerical results show that the lower and upper bounds are again very tight and that there is only a marginal rate loss due to imperfect csi .",
    "finally , we apply our analysis to the multi - user access scenario .",
    "the corresponding numerical results indicate that when equipped with a small number of high - resolution adcs , the mixed - adc architecture also achieves a large fraction of the achievable rate of conventional architecture and again outperforms antenna selection with the same number of high - resolution adcs .",
    "in addition , energy efficiencies of the mixed - adc architecture and of antenna selection are compared , taking that of conventional architecture as a baseline .",
    "numerical results reveal that under the same spectral efficiency loss , both the mixed - adc architecture and antenna selection achieve significant energy reduction .",
    "moreover , the mixed - adc architecture always outperforms antenna selection , especially in the multi - user scenario . in summary",
    ", the mixed - adc architecture strikes an attractive balance between spectral efficiency and energy efficiency , for both single - user and multi - user scenarios .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sect : system architecture ] outlines the system model .",
    "adopting gmi as the performance metric , section [ sect : gmi and combiner ] establishes the theoretical framework for fixed simo channels , based on which the optimal linear combiner and the asymptotic behaviors of the gmi in both low and high snr regimes are explored . besides , performance improvement through dithering is also investigated .",
    "then , section [ sect : ergodic fading channel ] extends the theoretical framework to ergodic fading channels and evaluates the the effects of imperfect csi on the system performance .",
    "section [ sect : multi - user ] applies the theoretical framework to the multi - user access scenario .",
    "furthermore , energy efficiency of the mixed - adc architecture is assessed in section [ sect : energy efficiency ] .",
    "numerical results are presented in section [ sect : numerical ] to corroborate the analysis .",
    "finally , section [ sect : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",

    "notation : _ throughout this paper , vectors and matrices are given in bold typeface , e.g. , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , while scalars are given in regular typeface , e.g. , @xmath6 .",
    "we use @xmath7 and @xmath8 to represent the 1-norm and 2-norm of vector @xmath4 , respectively , and let @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the conjugate , transpose and conjugate transpose of @xmath5 , respectively .",

    "we use @xmath22 to denote the sign function of a complex number @xmath6 , and @xmath23 to denote the natural logarithm of positive real number @xmath6 .",
    "several scenarios will be addressed in this paper , including fixed simo channels , ergodic fading simo channels with perfect or imperfect csi at the receiver , and multi - user channels with multiple single - antenna users and a multi - antenna bs . in this section ,",
    "we describe the fixed simo channel model , and the remaining scenarios will be introduced in later sections .        as aforementioned ,",
    "we consider a single - user system , where a single - antenna user communicates with an @xmath1-antenna bs .",
    "moreover , we consider a narrow - band channel model . ] , for which the channel vector @xmath24 is fixed throughout the transmission of the codeword and is assumed to be perfectly known by the bs .",
    "then the received signal at the bs can be expressed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the complex signal transmitted at the @xmath27-th symbol time , @xmath28 models the independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "complex gaussian noise vector , and @xmath29 is the codeword length .    in practice",
    ", the received signal at each antenna is quantized by a pair of adcs , one for each of the in - phase and quadrature ( i / q ) branches , so that further signal processing can be performed in the digital domain . despite of this , most of the literature on receiver design assume adc with virtually infinite precision for the tractability of analysis . for a large bs antenna array , however ,",
    "such assumption is no longer justified since the cost and energy consumption of conventional architecture scale linearly with the number of bs antennas , which will soon become the system bottleneck .",
    "therefore , we propose a mixed - adc architecture in which only @xmath30 high - resolution adcs are available and all the other @xmath31 adcs are with only one - bit resolution .",
    "we further let the i / q outputs at each antenna be quantized by two adcs of the same kind .",

    "to make the expression compact , we introduce @xmath38 and rewrite as @xmath39 then , we define an adc switch vector @xmath40^{t}$ ] , which follows the subsequent restriction @xmath41 and should be optimized according to the channel @xmath24 so that the limited number of high - resolution adcs will be well utilized to enhance the system performance .    for transmission of rate @xmath42 ,",

    "@xmath57 , as the codeword length @xmath29 grows without bound . with @xmath58 pairs of one - bit adcs ,",
    "the channel capacity @xmath59 is less than @xmath60 due to information loss during quantization .    as discussed in the introduction , instead of numerically evaluating @xmath59 , in the following",
    ", we adopt the nearest - neighbor decoding rule at the decoder , and leverage the general framework developed in @xcite to investigate the gmi of the mixed - adc architecture .",
    "the gmi acts as an achievable rate and thus also a lower bound of @xmath59 . to this end",
    ", we introduce a linear combiner to process the channel output vector , as illustrated in figure [ fig : systemmodel ] .",

    "decides the received message as the one that minimizes . here",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath67 is adopted to adjust the power imbalance between the channel input @xmath26 and the processed output @xmath68 contributed collectively by the channel , one - bit quantization and the linear combiner , and should be selected appropriately for optimizing the decoding performance .",

    "the corresponding @xmath77 is @xmath93    noticing that @xmath87 is a positive semidefinite hermitian matrix , from we have @xmath94 where the inequality follows from cauchy - schwartz s inequality , which holds equality if and only if @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath96 .",
    "the subsequent corollary demonstrates that the mixed - adc architecture achieves better performance than antenna selection with the same number of high - resolution adcs .",

    "numerical results are given by figure [ fig : fig_4 ] assuming @xmath221 , indicating that the gap between lower and upper bounds is still virtually negligible .",
    "on the other hand , though there is a noticeable rate loss due to channel estimation error , the mixed - adc architecture with a small number of high - resolution adcs still achieves much of the the channel capacity of the conventional architecture with perfect csi .",
