    "the solar corona is permeated by invisible magnetic field lines , which can be illuminated by filling with hot coronal plasma , also called `` coronal loops '' or `` strands '' .",
    "they are supposedly field - aligned in regions with a low plasma-@xmath8 parameter .",
    "the geometry of such coronal loops can be characterized by the curvi - linear 3-d coordinates @xmath9 $ ] of a potential or non - potential magnetic field line ( as a function of the loop length coordinate @xmath10 ) along the loop axis , and by the cross - sectional width variation @xmath11 in transverse direction to the loop axis .",
    "both properties are controlled by the magnetic field . since cross - field transport",
    "is inhibited in a low plasma-@xmath8 corona , plasma can only move along field lines , and thus the spatial organization of the coronal heating mechanism is to some extent preserved in the cross - sectional geometry and topology of loop cross - sections . in particular , we are interested in the size of the thinnest loop strands , which have been postulated in so - called `` nanoflare heating '' scenarios and may be detected now with the most recent instruments with the highest spatial resolution .",
    "thus we are interested in the spatial organization and statistical distributions of loop cross sections , which may provide us clues about the geometry of the elusive coronal heating mechanism .",
    "previous studies on the width of coronal loop cross - sections have been focused on the finest widths that could be spatially resolved with a particular telescope ( i.e. , bray and loughhead 1985 ; loughhead et al .  1985 ; aschwanden and nightingale 2005 ; winebarger et al .  2013 ;",

    "while theoretical models require the knowledge of the relevant coronal heating mechanisms , which are still elusive at this time , there exists essentially no theoretical prediction of the statistical distribution of loop widths in the solar corona that could be tested with current high - resolution data .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated in recent work that the statistical distributions of physical parameters in nonlinear energy dissipation processes can be modeled in terms of _ self - organized criticality ( soc ) _ models ( bak , tang , and wiesenfeld 1987 ) , in geology ( e.g. , sand piles or earthquakes ) , as well as in a large number of astrophysical phenomena ( e.g. , solar and stellar flares , pulsar glitches , soft x - ray gamma repeaters , blazars , etc . , for a recent review see aschwanden et al .",
    "in essence , _ soc is a critical state of a nonlinear energy dissipation system that is slowly and continuously driven towards a critical value of a system - wide instability threshold , producing scale - free , fractal - diffusive , and intermittent avalanches with powerlaw - like size distributions _ ( aschwanden 2014 ) . if we consider coronal heating events on the most basic level , in the sense of an elementary energy dissipation episode in a single loop structure , it is not much different in a solar flare or in a nanoflare ( for scale - free or self - similar processes ) , and may be produced by the same physical mechanisms ( of magnetic reconnection , plamsa heating , and cooling by thermal conduction and radiative loss ) , except that flares have a higher degree of spatial complexity ( with multiple loops and strands ) than nanoflares ( within a single strand ) .",
    "the power law behavior in the temporal and spatial distributions of the ohmic heating simulated in a 3d mhd model has been interpreted in terms of a soc system specifically for the case of coronal heating ( bingert and peter 2013 ) .",
    "almost every ( nonlinear ) instability produces  avalanching events  over some scale - free range , in contrast to the statistics of linear random events that usually form a gaussian probability distribution with a preferred typical ( spatial ) scale . therefore , the measurement of the statistical distribution of loop widths should tell us at least whether the underlying coronal heating mechanism is a linear random process ( leading to a gaussian distribution ) or a nonlinear dissipative process ( leading to a power law distribution ) .",
    "a size distribution exhibits a power law function over a restricted range @xmath12 $ ] only ( called the `` inertial range '' or `` scale - free range '' ) , and is bound by a lower limit @xmath13 for the smallest observed size , and by an upper limit @xmath14 for the largest and rarest observed size , often close to the system size . the lower limit",
    "is affected by the sensitivity threshold of the observations and the instrumental spatial resolution .",
    "the finite spatial resolution modifies the measured width also , in a predictable manner , as it can be modeled with the point spread function of the imaging instrument .",
    "these effects have never been modeled for loop width measurements , which is now possible in large statistical samples , thanks to powerful new tools of automated loop recognition software that has been developed recently ( aschwanden , de pontieu , and katrukha 2013a ) .",
    "we will use recent high - resolution data from the _ atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) _ instrument ( lemen et al .",
    "2012 ) onboard the _ solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) _ ( pesnell et al .",
    "2011 ) , and _ hi - c _ data ( kobayashi et al .",
    "2014 ) to test theoretical predictions of loop width distributions . in section 2",
    "we start with an analytical description of statistical width distributions . in section 3",
    "we describe the applied data analysis method , which includes automated pattern recognition and _ principal component analysis ( cpa ) _ techniques . in section 4 we conduct monte - carlo simulations of our automated loop width detection algorithm , in section 5 we apply this algorithm to high - resolution aia / sdo and hi - c images , in section 6 we discuss the results in the light of previous loop width measurements , and in section 7 we present the conclusions .",
    "the physical parameter of interest here is the `` loop width '' , which we will define in terms of the equivalent width of the radial loop cross - sectional flux profile @xmath15 in section 3.2 ( eq .",
    "14 ) , being equivalent to the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "in order to model size distributions of loop widths in a realistic manner we have to include threshold effects due to the finite sensitivity and spatial resolution of the instruments , which are characterized in terms of a point spread function .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the statistics of nonlinear energy dissipation events often exhibit a power law - like function in their size distribution .",
    "a most general testable prediction that can be made for scale - free nonlinear energy dissipation processes is the so - called _ scale - free probability conjecture _ ( aschwanden 2012 ) , which universally applies to _ self - organized criticality ( soc ) _ systems ( bak et al .",
    "1987 ) , and predicts a power law distribution @xmath16 for length scales @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the euclidean dimension of the system . if we use the widths @xmath20 of coronal loops as the length scale of the cross - sectional area over which an `` avalanching '' mechanism dissipates energy and heats a particular coronal loop , the euclidean dimension of cross - sectional areas is @xmath21 , and thus a power law distribution of @xmath22 is expected . the diagram shown in fig .",
    "1 depicts 3 sets of loops ( with widths of @xmath20=1 , 1/2 and 1/4 ) , which are packed into 2-d areas with identical sizes ( @xmath23 ) , yielding bundles of @xmath24=1 , 4 , and 16 strands , as expected from the size distribution specified in eq .",
    "even when a fraction of the packing area is used only ( e.g. , @xmath25 as illustrated with dark - grey loop areas in fig .  1 ) , the relative probability or size distribution follows the same statistical power law relationship as specified in eq .",
    "( 1 ) .      the scale - free range of a size distribution ( for instance of widths @xmath26 ) exhibits an ideal power law function for the differential occurrence frequency distribution , which is characterized with a power law slope @xmath3 , @xmath27 however , there are at least four natural effects that produce a deviation from an ideal power law size distribution , which includes : ( 1 ) a physical threshold of an instability ; ( 2 ) incomplete sampling of the smallest events below a theshold ; ( 3 ) contamination by an event - unrelated background ; and ( 4 ) truncation effects at the largest events due to a finite system size , which all can be modeled with a so - called _",
    "`` thresholded power law '' _ distribution function , also called pareto [ type ii ] or lomax distribution ( lomax 1954 ) , @xmath28 which was found to fit flux distributions of solar and stellar flare data well , in the scale - free range @xmath29 ( aschwanden 2015 ) .",
    "the additive constant @xmath30 turns a power law function into a constant for small values @xmath31 at the left side of a size distribution ( fig .",
    "2a ; dashed curve ) , a feature that fits some data , but not all .",
    "examples for different phenomena are shown in fig .",
    "8 of aschwanden ( 2015 ) , based on data presented in clauset et al .",
    "the functional shapes of size distributions are shown in fig .  2 , which shows the ideal power law slope at @xmath32 ( eq .  2 ; thin solid line in fig .",
    "2a ) , and the thresholded power law function ( eq .  3 ; dashed line in fig .",
    "2a ) , where the threshold is set at @xmath33 , all shown on a log - log scale in fig .",
    "since we are going to analyze the contributions of the thinnest loop strands to the size distribution of loop widths , we have to include a number of effects that set a lower limit on the measurement of loop widths , such as the finite instrumental spatial resolution and loop background noise , which we discuss in more detail with a quantitative example in section 2.5 .",
    "at this point we combine these effects into the variable @xmath0 , which represents an absolute lower limit in the theoretical model distribution of loop widths @xmath20 . the effectively detected loop width ( or observed loop width ) @xmath20 can be defined in terms of adding the true loop width @xmath34 and the combined broadening effects expressed in @xmath0 in quadrature , @xmath35 so that the true width @xmath34 can be obtained from the observables @xmath20 and @xmath0 , @xmath36 substituting the variable @xmath37 into the thresholded distribution function @xmath38)$ ] @xmath39 ( eq .",
    "3 ) , where we denote @xmath40 ( in eq .  5 ) and @xmath41 ( in eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) , and inserting its derivative , @xmath42 , we obtain then the theoretical size distribution @xmath43 of apparent ( or modeled observed ) loop widths @xmath20 , @xmath44 which is shown in fig .  2a ( dash - dotted line ) as a function of the normalized width @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the spatial resolution causes an upturn with an excess above the thresholded power law distribution right near @xmath46 , while no events are detected below the limit @xmath47 . however , the sharp peak at @xmath48 may not be observable , because the loop width measurements have inherently some uncertainties that smooth out such sharp peaks in the observed size distributions , and show the most frequent detections at a peak value of @xmath49 , rather than at the absolute limit @xmath48 ( see numerical simulations in section 4 and point - spread functions of euv imaging instruments , compiled in table 3 and references therein ) .      in our data analysis ,",
    "the width @xmath20 of a loop cross - section is measured from the equivalent width of a gaussian - like loop flux profile , where a local background is subtracted with a lowpass filter , and the high - frequency data noise is filtered out with a highpass filter .",
    "this method , as well as many others , produce uncertainties in the loop width measurement of order of one pixel for the thinnest loop strands , mainly because the true background flux profile is unknown and perturbed by data noise . as a consequence ,",
    "the size distribution of loop widths exhibits a smooth drop - off towards the minimum value at @xmath50 .    in order to provide a realistic analytical model of a size distribution that can reproduce such an absolute cutoff value we have to replace the threshold parameter @xmath51 with a reciprocal function @xmath52 that has a singularity at @xmath53 , @xmath54 where we introduced an arbitrary constant @xmath55 , to be determined .",
    "this type of distribution contains the desired singularity at @xmath56 , and setting it to zero for smaller values @xmath57 enforces an absolute lower cutoff at @xmath56 .",
    "we explore the maximum of this distribution function by setting the derivative to zero , i.e. , @xmath58 , and find that the peak value @xmath1 of the distribution function ( eq .  7 ) is related to the constant @xmath55 by , @xmath59 while the maximum value @xmath60 of the distribution function at @xmath1 amounts to , @xmath61 inserting the constant @xmath55 ( eq .",
    "8) into the distribution function @xmath43 ( eq .  7 ) yields then , @xmath62 this definition of a size distribution has the following properties , which are illustrated in fig .  2 : ( 1 ) the distribution has two regimes , a scale - free range at large values @xmath63 that follows a power law function , and a smooth cutoff range at small values @xmath64 ; ( 2 ) a peak of the distribution @xmath65 at the value @xmath66 ; ( 3 ) the size distribution is completely defined in the entire range of @xmath67 with an absolute lower cutoff at @xmath68 ; ( 4 ) the distribution function can be represented with four parameters ( @xmath69 , or more conveniently expressed in terms of the peak parameters , @xmath70 , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 . since the parameter @xmath0 is a constant for a given instrument , only the three parameters @xmath73 need to be optimized in a fitting procedure for each data set .",
    "a family of such size distributions with various peak values @xmath1 is depicted in fig .",
    "we will see that this type of power law distribution with a smooth cutoff range @xmath74 $ ] suits the observed size distributions much better ( figs .",
    "6h , 10h , 14h ) than the thresholded power law function with the threshold constant @xmath75 ( eq .  3 ) , or the sharply peaked power law function with a lower cutoff at the spatial resolution @xmath0 ( eq .  6 ) .",
    "let us discuss the physical meaning of the minimum loop width @xmath0 that we introduced in the previously defined theoretical distributions .",
    "the major contribution to the minimum detected loop width is the instrumental point - spread function @xmath76 .",
    "typically , the instrumental point - spread function of euv or soft x - ray telescopes amounts to @xmath77 pixels of the ccd detectors , mostly dictated by the electronic charge spreading .",
    "for instance , the azimuthally - averaged point - spread function of the transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) has been determined with a blind iterative deconvolution technique to be @xmath782.5 pixels , or @xmath79 ( golub et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "in addition , the measured loop widths are affected by data noise in the subtracted background counts in every pixel , which is most severe for faint loops on top of a strongly varying background , especially since we apply a high - pass filtering technique ( rather than a gaussian fitting of loop cross - section profiles ) . from numerous tests we evaluated that this loop width broadening component has a standard deviation of @xmath80 pixel . a more detailed discussion of this quantity including quiet - sun background counts , poissonian photon noise , readout noise , digitization noise , lossless compression , pedestal dark current , integer subtraction , and spike residuals is given for the trace instrument in aschwanden et al .  ( 2000c ) .    combining these loop width broadening effects by summing in quadrature we specify an observed loop width @xmath20 by , @xmath81 where @xmath34 represents the unknown true width for a given loop segment .",
    "a quantitative example is illustrated in fig .",
    "4e , where a mean fwhm width of @xmath82 pixels is measured from 75 loop cross - sections .",
    "if we estimate a point - spread function width of @xmath83 pixels , a data noise component of @xmath84 pixel , we obtain with eq .  ( 11 ) a true loop width of @xmath85^{1/2 } \\approx [ 2.9 ^ 2 - 2.5 ^ 2 - 1.0 ^ 2]^{1/2 } \\approx 1.1 $ ] pixels .",
    "thus , the expected minimum observed loop width for unresolved loop strands ( with @xmath86 pixel ) is @xmath87^{1/2 } \\approx 2.7 $ ] pixels .    in summary ,",
    "the following symbols are used for loop widths : @xmath20 is generally used for the observed ( or modeled observed ) loop width , @xmath34 is the true ( fully resolved ) loop width , @xmath0 is the minimum width in the theoretical model distribution , @xmath88 is the simulated loop width , @xmath76 is the point - spread function , and @xmath89 is the broadening due to background subtraction data noise . in the numerical simulations , an instrumental point - spread function with a width of @xmath83 pixels is applied .",
    "our data analysis method consists of two major steps : ( 1 ) the automated loop detection , and ( 2 ) a _ principal component analysis ( pca ) _ applied to generate loop width distributions .",
    "the automated detection of features with a large range of spatial scales is not trivial , especially when small and large structures coexist and blend into each other , or overlap with each other , as it is the case for a solar corona image with many different loops along any given line - of - sight .",
    "we make use of an already existing automated loop detection code , the so - called _ oriented coronal curved loop tracing _ code occult-2 ( aschwanden et al .",
    "2008c , 2013a ; aschwanden 2010 ) , which is customized for automated detection of curvi - linear coronal ( or chromospheric ) loops ( or fibrils ) with relatively large curvature radii , compared with their cross - sectional width .",
    "the numerical code , written in the _ interactive data language ( idl ) _ is publicly available in the _ solarsoftware ( ssw ) _ library , with a tutorial given at _http://www.lmsal.com/@xmath90aschwand/software/tracing/tracing@xmath91tutorial1.html_ .",
    "the occult-2 code can be applied to any 2-d image with an intensity ( or flux ) distribution @xmath92 , from which the cartesian coordinates @xmath93 $ ] of a set of 2-d curvi - linear structures as a function of their length coordinate @xmath10 are determined .",

    "unsharp masking_.    the numerical algorithm of automated curvi - linear pattern detection works as follows .",

    "3 ) , @xmath102 = \\arctan{\\left({dy / ds \\over dx / ds}\\right ) }      \\ .\\ ] ] in addition , the curvature radius @xmath103 of the local ridge is determined also in order to obtain a second - order polynomial approximation of the traced loop structure . a geometric diagram of the parameterized first and second - order elements measured in a single point of a curvi - linear ridge is shown in fig .",
    "then the same direction is extrapolated in second - order as an approximate prediction for the continuation of the loop direction .",
    "the exact direction of the traced loop segment at the next loop coordinate @xmath104 is then evaluated by maximizing the cross - correlation coefficient between the ( generally gaussian - like ) subsequent loop cross - sectional profile @xmath105 $ ] compared with the previous profile @xmath106 $ ] .",

    "the automated loop detection continues from @xmath109 to @xmath110 in the first loop segment step , and then from @xmath111 to @xmath112 in the second loop segment step , and so forth .",
    "the end of the first half loop segment occurs when the bipass - filtered flux values drop below a selectable threshold ( typically set at one standard deviation of the flux of the background variation ) .",
    "the code traces then the second half of the loop segment in the same way , except in reverse direction , starting from the initial maximum value at @xmath113 $ ] .",

    "is then erased in the bipass - filtered image , so that an already traced loop segment is not used multiple times in the tracing of a new structure .",
    "this procedure of detecting the first loop is then continued at the location of the next image maximum @xmath117 $ ] and repeated for the structure with the second - highest contrast , and so forth , until the zero floor or a preset threshold value in the bipass - filtered image is reached . in the end the code produces a list of @xmath118 $ ] loop coordinates for @xmath119 loop segments , each one containing @xmath120 coordinate points .",
    "there are a few control parameters that can be set in the occult-2 code , such as the maximum number of traced structures @xmath121 per image or wavelength , the highpass filter @xmath95 , the lowpass filter @xmath96 , the minimum accepted loop length @xmath122 , the minimum allowed curvature radius @xmath123 , the field line step @xmath124 along the ( projected ) loop coordinate , the flux threshold @xmath125 ( in units of the median value of positive fluxes in the original image ) , the filter flux threshold @xmath126 ( in units of the median value in the positive bipass - filtered fluxes ) , the maximum allowed gap @xmath127 with zero or negative fluxes along a traced ridge . in our analysis",

    "we will present some parametric studies in section 4 in order to investigate systematic trends of the algorithm .",
    "the occult-2 code applies a bipass - filter to an image @xmath92 , consisting of a highpass filter with a selectable smoothing boxcar length @xmath95 , and a lowpass filter with a boxcar length @xmath96 .",

    "an example of an automatically traced loop with extraction of the loop width profiles in perpendicular direction to the loop axis is shown in fig .",

    "4e , the mean loop width is found to be @xmath145 pixels , where the uncertainty mostly results from the point - spread function , the noisy background , and multiple overlapping loop strands .",
    "the automated measurement of loop widths is performed in steps of @xmath146 pixels along each loop segment , which typically yields 10 - 100 times more width measurements than loop detections .    for the detection of structures with cross - sectional widths covering a range of two decades",

    "2004 ; casini et al .  2005 ; cadavid et al .  2008 ; zharkova et al .  2012 ) .",
    "hence , we can run the automated loop detection for every image multiple times with independent ( orthogonal ) bipass filters @xmath148 , in order to obtain a completely sampled range of width measurements .",
    "the smallest smoothing boxcar width ( @xmath149 pixel ) approximately corresponds to the instrumental resolution , while an upper limit of @xmath150 pixels covers about two orders of magnitude in the range of width measurements , with @xmath151 pixels .",
    "the choice of filters by powers of 2 yields a uniform distribution of widths @xmath152 on a logarithmic scale , @xmath153 .",
    "the occult-2 code yields then a number of detected loop structures @xmath154 for each selected width @xmath155 .",
    "this yields directly a frequency occurrence distribution ( or size distribution ) @xmath43 of loop structures , which is generally displayed on a @xmath156 ( number versus size ) plot .",
    "in other words , the option of width filters in the occult-2 code can be directly used for the measurement of size distributions @xmath43 .",
    "of course , structures that are detected on relatively large scales of @xmath157 mm , are likely to consist of more complex structures ( e.g. , arcades of loops ) , rather than traditional field - aligned monolithic loops .",
    "the size distributions can have different functional shapes , each one being a characteristic of the underlying physical process .",
    "for instance , random measurements of linear processes yield a gaussian normal distribution , while nonlinear dissipative processes yield a power law distribution . by measuring the size distribution ,",
    "we obtain thus a diagnostic of the underlying ( linear or nonlinear ) physical generation mechanism .",
    "in order to test and validate the numerical code to measure the size distributions @xmath43 of loop widths @xmath20 within a specified range , we present a basic monte - carlo simulation ( section 4.1 ) , and investigate the effect of finite spatial resolution on the inferred loop width size distribution @xmath43 ( section 4.2 ) .",

    "we run the automated loop detection code occult-2 on each of the 7 images , using a threshold of @xmath175 standard deviations ( in the bipass - filtered image ) , we require a minimum length of @xmath130 pixels for the selected loop length segments , and show the detected loop tracings in fig .  6 ( red curves ) , which appear to be fairly complete in all filters , as judged by visual detection . comparing the detected structures with the theoretically simulated image ( fig .",
    "5a ) on a pixel - by - pixel basis , we find that 80% of the simulated image pixels are retrieved with the correct values , using the automated occult-2 code .",
    "then we fit the histograms of loop widths , which includes 152,564 loop widths measurements in 1254 loop segments detected in 7 different filter images . for the power law slopes of the resulting width distributions",

    "we tested input values of the power law slope in the range of @xmath177 in the simulations , but obtained invariably values of @xmath178 after auto - detection with our multi - scale sampling method .",
    "a method for the power law slope retrieval can in principle be designed by eliminating multiple countings of loops , but this requires a unique definition of the mathematical function of loop cross - section profiles , which is an ambiguous task and is not necessary for the measurement of the size distribution of the smallest loop strands here .    inspecting the peak of the size distribution of widths @xmath165",

    "the present study therefore does not discriminate between `` classical coronal loops '' and `` loop - like transition region phenomena '' , nor does it disentangle the 3d topology of nested loop structures . nevertheless , the sampling is complete in the 2d image plane ( thanks to the automated loop detection algorithm ) , and thus no ad hoc assumptions of loop selection criteria are applied , which makes it more suitable to compare with theoretical models of statistical distributions , rather than a hand - picked sample of selected ( loop ) structures .",
    "the detection of a lower cutoff for the widths of the smallest loop strands depends crucially on the spatial resolution or pixel size of the image . in a monte - carlo simulation",

    "the finest loop widths have been detected preferentially in euv , while the loop widths measured in soft x - rays and optical wavelengths tend to be significantly larger , and are found to be largest in radio wavelengths .",
    "this can be explained because coronal loops in euv and soft x - rays are produced by optically thin bremsstrahlung , which yields a better contrast than the partially optically thick free - free and gyroresonance emission in radio wavelengths .    in table 3",
    "we also list the pixel size @xmath268 and the spatial resolution @xmath269 of the instruments . in fig .",
    "18 we can clearly see at one glance that the smallest loop widths are almost always measured a significant factor above the instrumental pixel sizes , which is partially explained by the point - spread function that typically amounts to 2.5 pixels in current euv imagers ( trace , aia / sdo , stereo , iris , hi - c ) .",
    "interestingly , the same ratio of @xmath245 is also found in our present work , which corresponds to the optimum detection efficiency of our automated loop tracing algorithm ( using bipass filters ) in the case of the monte - carlo simulations , besides the effects of the point - spread function in the analyzed aia and hi - c data . since every loop width measurement is subject to noise in the background , which causes some scatter in the order of a pixel size , for instance @xmath270 ( pixels ) in the example shown in fig .",
    "the lowest width measurements can be as low as @xmath271 pixel using the equivalent - width method ( eq .  14 ) .",
    "some measurements shown in fig .",
    "18 exhibit even smaller widths than one pixel , because the authors attempted to determine the true width after deconvolution of the point - spread function , i.e. , @xmath272 ( eq .  4 and fig .",
    "virtually all studies that report loop width measurements are based on a single loop or a small number of visually selected ( hand - picked ) loops , which may contain the smallest features visible in an image , but they are not representative samples that would allow us to derive the entire width distribution of all coronal loops seen in an image .",

    "our continuously developing technology has faciliated tremendous improvements in astronomical high - resolution observations , so that the available spatial resolution improved by a factor of about 300 over the last 35 years . in particular , the measurement of coronal loop diameters improved from @xmath292 mm ( davis and krieger 1982 ) down to @xmath293 mm with the current hi - c observations ( peter et al .",
    "2013 ; brooks et al .  2013 , 2016 ) .",
    "our new finding of a preferred spatial scale of @xmath255 km for coronal loops calls for a physical explanation of this particular value .",
    "this peak width value @xmath1 separates the two regimes of a smooth cutoff range ( @xmath294 ) and of a scale - free power law distribution at larger values ( @xmath295 ) .",
    "one obvious physical scale is the granulation structure of the photosphere , discovered by sir william herschel in 1801 .",
    "the spatial size of the time - varying granulation is measured by a combination of high - pass and low - pass filtering in the spatial frequency domain with subsequent thresholding , which segments granular and intergranular lanes .",
    "alternative procedures are `` lane - finding '' schemes that are based on local gradient detection ( spruit et al .",
    "1990 ) . with the latter method , the smallest granules , near the observational limit , were found to have a most frequent size of 290 km .",
    "the size distribution peaks at @xmath296 km , then shows a slow decline in number up to a diameter near 1500 km , and then a rapid decline towards the largest granule sizes ( brandt 2001 ) .",
    "modern measurements with the _ new solar telescope at big bear _ , show a peak in the occurrence distribution of granule sizes shifted further down to @xmath297 km ( abramenko et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "if we adopt the magneto - convection of photospheric granular cells as the primary driver of local magnetic reconnection processes ( in the chromosphere , transition region , and corona ) , for instance see numerical mhd simulations by gudiksen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) or bingert and peter ( 2013 ) , we would expect a congruence between the magnetic reconnection area and the cross - sectional loop heating area ( aschwanden et al .",
    "2007a , b ) .",
    "the diffusion region of a local magnetic reconnection process essentially defines the spatial scale of a local heating event , and therefore the cross - sectional area of a coronal loop .",
    "our new result of a preferred cross - sectional scale of @xmath298 km , which appears to be perfectly comparable with the most frequent granular scale , adds an additional constraint to the geometry of the heating process , besides ten other arguments that have been discussed earlier in the context of the coronal heating paradox ( aschwanden et al .",
    "2007a , b ) .    the second school of thought deals with unresolved `` microscopic '' structures .",
    "the `` nanoflare heating '' scenario ( klimchuk 2006 ) builds on parker s ( 1988 ) conjecture that tangential misalignments of the magnetic field between adjacent flux tubes sporadically reconnect , driven by the braiding random motion of coronal loop footpoints in the photosphere .",
    "since magneto - convection of the photosphere plays an important role as driver for magnetic braiding , which applies to both schools , the major difference between the monolithic and the nanoflare heating scenario is mostly the assumed spatial scale of the heating region , which contrasts the macroscopic view versus the microscopic view .",
    "there is a general consensus that broad loops are likely to consist of bundles of finer strands , as alluded to in fig .  1 ,",
    "but the crucial question remains what the finest scale of a composite loop is . in the scale - free regime of a width distribution , a power - law like distribution function is generally observed that extends from @xmath299 down to the peak value @xmath1 , where it breaks down by some unknown cutoff mechanisms . if nanoflares on finer scales exist , we would expect that the power law function extends to lower values than the observed cutoff , while the apparent peak width occurs at @xmath245 due to the finite resolution",
    ". however , our crucial observation of @xmath300 in hi - c data contradicts this assumption that most frequent nanoflare strands exist at smaller spatial scales than @xmath301 km .",
    "this implies a physical limit , similar to the observed lower limit of granule sizes .",
    "therefore we conclude that the hi - c data are not consistent with a nanoflare scenario with most frequent loop strands at @xmath302 km .",
    "in addition , current nanoflare scenarios have difficulties to explain the isothermality of macroscopic loops ( aschwanden and nightingale 2005 ; aschwanden 2008 ) , but see recent modifications in terms of `` nanoflare storm '' scenarios ( klimchuk 2015 ) .    the best efforts to model parker s",
    "nanoflare scenario do not show a clear structuring across the ( large - scale ) magnetic field . in the turbulent ( reduced ) mhd model of rappazzo",
    "et al .  (",
    "2008 ) current sheets ( along the large - scale magnetic field ) form throughout the computational domain .",
    "no obvious structuring of the current sheets into bundles are found , where the heating is concentrated and which ( in a more realistic model ) could give rise to a coronal loop .",
    "so there is the need for an external process that would lead to a cross - field scale producing loops of finite width , and the photospheric magneto - convection is a good candidate for this .",
    "besides the consequences of loop width statistics on coronal heating models , there are numerous implications for coronal electron density measurements also .",
    "the emission measure of optically thin plasma , observed in euv and soft x - rays , depends on the column depth , which is set equal to loop diameters for coronal loops with a circular cross - section .",
    "thus , the density in coronal loops can only be determined if their diameter or width is known , such as sxt / yohkoh measurements of soft x ray - bright flare loops ( aschwanden and benz 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , measurements of coronal widths are essential for all theoretical models that require an electron density , such as calculations of the thermal energy , coronal filling factors , gyro - synchrotron emissivity , alfvn speed , or coronal seismology . such consequences will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "in this study we explore the distribution of coronal loop widths with the aia / sdo and the hi - c instrument , which provide the highest spatial resolution available among current solar euv imagers .",
    "particular emphasis is given to the simultaneous data gathered during the hi - c rocket flight on 2012 july 11 .",
    "the scientific motivation for this study is the investigation of limits on the finest loop strands , which represent the `` rosetta stone '' of coronal heating models in discriminating microscopic ( nanoflare strands ) versus macroscopic ( monolithic ) loops . for this purpose",
    "we calculate analytical functions for the expected size distribution of loop widths , conduct numerical monte - carlo simulations to develop a diagnostic tool to discriminate whether the finest detected loop strands are spatially resolved or not , and analyze aia and hi - c data to apply this diagnostic tool to find fundamental limits on the smallest loop strands .",
    "we briefly summarize the results and conclusions in the following .    1 .",
    "we apply the occult-2 code for the automated detection of curvi - linear structures in euv images from aia and hi - c .",
    "this code is able to measure @xmath303 loop widths in a hi - c image .",
    "while previous loop widths have been measured only in small numbers and produced non - representative samples , this code allows us to obtain complete size distributions of loop widths , extending over two orders of magnitude , which was not possible with previous manual methods .",
    "we applied bipass filters ( consisting of a low - pass and high - pass filter ) , with a series of independent filter width components that increase by a factor of two over two orders of magnitude , which corresponds to orthogonal basis functions in principal component analysis methods .",
    "this range of spatial scales is suitable to reconstruct power law - like size distributions of loop widths .",
    "while no coronal loop model exists that predicts the size distribution of loop widths , we make use of the self - organized criticality approach , which predicts a power law function with a slope that depends on the ( spatial ) fractal dimension of a nonlinear energy dissipation system .",
    "we generalize the ideal power law function by including threshold effects and corrections due to finite instrumental spatial resolution .",
    "we introduce a smooth ( lower ) cutoff , which leads to a new analytical formulation of the size distribution function over the entire range @xmath304 $ ] , characterized by 4 free parameters : the minimum width @xmath0 , the peak width @xmath1 , the peak number @xmath305 , and the power law slope @xmath3 .",
    "4 .    from monte - carlo simulations of euv images with numerous loops that follow a prescribed power law distribution with a lower cutoff and random fluxes",
    "we explore how the peak width ( or most frequently occurring width ) @xmath1 depends on the lower cutoff in the width distribution of loop strands , using different pixel sizes @xmath4 ( to mimic different spatial resolutions ) .",
    "we find that loop distributions that have a peak at @xmath306 contain unresolved strands , while larger width ratios indicate resolved structures at a pixel size @xmath4 . in the case of resolved structures",
    ", we find a relationship between the minimum strand width @xmath0 and the critical resolution @xmath4 that separates the two regimes of resolved and unresolved loop widths , i.e. , @xmath307 , which can be used to diagnose the lower cutoff of a completely sampled loop width distribution .",
    "the aia 193  image rescaled to pixel sizes ranging from @xmath195 to @xmath308 yields size distributions of loop cross - section widths that have a peak at an invariant ratio of @xmath309 , while a slightly higher value is obtained near the full resolution , which indicates according to our numerical simulations that the structures are marginally resolved at the full resolution of @xmath187 , and that the most frequent value of the loop size distribution has a value of @xmath310 km .",
    "the hi - c 193 image that was observed simultaneously with the aia 193  image , sampled at full resolution of @xmath311 , yields a size distribution of loop widths peaking at @xmath312 , which indicates according to our numerical simulations that all structures are over - resolved at the full resolution . when we re - scale the hi - c image in the range of @xmath313 , we find a most frequent loop width of @xmath281 km .",
    "we identified 52 studies that contain loop width measurements , observed in optical , h@xmath94 , ly@xmath94 , soft x - rays ( sxr ) , extreme ultra - violet ( euv ) , and radio wavelengths , which report values over a range of @xmath314 mm .",
    "all previous measurements were carried out on single loops or a small number of loops , while this study samples for the first time loop cross - sections over a scale range of two orders of magnitude in each image .",
    "the finest loop widths have been detected with iris and hi - c have a lower limit of @xmath315 km and a peak value of the most frequently observed ( resolved ) loop width of @xmath255 km .",
    "the closest confirmation is the hi - c study of brooks et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , which shows 91 loops with a low cutoff of @xmath316 km and a peak at @xmath317 km .",
    "the coronal loop widths inferred here , with a peak value of @xmath255 km and a minimum of @xmath318 km agrees with the size of the most frequently occurring granule sizes in the photosphere . we conclude that this geometric congruence supports coronal heating models that are driven by photospheric magneto - convection and operate most frequently on a macroscopic scale of @xmath286 km , rather than nanoflare heating models that involve unresolved loop strands beyond the spatial resolution of current instrumentation .",
    "this is the first study that finds an absolute lower limit on the width of coronal loops , based on automated measurements with large statistics , from which the size distribution of loop widths can be sampled and diagnostic criteria can be derived that are capable to distinguish whether the finest loops observed in a high - resolution image are resolved or not , for a given instrument . since a size distribution contains much more information than a single case measurement , this statistical approach with automated loop detection and size distribution modeling offers more powerful tools to test coronal heating models than previous single point measurements , which all are not representative samples of the entirity of all coronal loops .",
    "if the inferred absolute lower limit on loop widths holds up in complementary future studies , we may conclude that we are hitting the rock bottom of loop width sizes",
    ". a major consequence may be the irrelevance of ( hypothetical ) unresolved nanoflare structures .",
    "we acknowledge useful comments from an anonymous referee and discussions with harry warren , jim klimchuk , karel schrijver , and amy winebarger .",

    "<S> in this study we analyze _ atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) _ and hi - c images in order to investigate absolute limits for the finest loop strands . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a model of the occurrence - size distribution function of coronal loop widths , characterized by the lower limit of widths @xmath0 , the peak ( or most frequent ) width @xmath1 , the peak occurrence number @xmath2 , and a power law slope @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our data analysis includes automated tracing of curvi - linear features with the occult-2 code , automated sampling of the cross - sectional widths of coronal loops , and fitting of the theoretical size distribution to the observed distribution . </S>",
    "<S> with monte - carlo simulations and variable pixel sizes @xmath4 we derive a first diagnostic criterion to discriminate whether the loop widths are unresolved @xmath5 , or fully resolved ( if @xmath6 ) . for images with resolved loop widths </S>",
    "<S> we can apply a second diagnostic criterion that predicts the lower limit of loop widths as a function of the spatial resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the loop widths are marginally resolved in aia images , but are fully resolved in hi - c images , where our model predicts a most frequent ( peak ) value at @xmath7 550 km , in agreement with recent results of brooks et al . </S>",
    "<S> this result agrees with the statistics of photospheric granulation sizes and thus supports coronal heating mechanisms operating on the macroscopic scale of photospheric magneto - convection , rather than nanoflare braiding models on unresolved microscopic scales . </S>"
