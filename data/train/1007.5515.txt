    "the two most popular candidates for particle dark matter are a wimp ( with particular emphasis on the lsp in gravity - mediated susy breaking models ) and the qcd axion .",
    "however , in a wide range of technicolor and hidden sector gauge mediation models , the most natural dark matter candidate is a neutral particle carrying an approximately conserved baryon number like quantum number in the hidden sector @xcite .",
    "the relic abundance of this particle is not thermal , but is determined by a primordial asymmetry generated in the very early universe .",
    "such models do not have the `` wimp miracle '' , but do open up the possibility of explaining the ratio between baryon and dark matter densities @xcite .",
    "we have two primary motivations for interest in these candidates .",
    "gauge - mediated susy breaking resolves many of the otherwise puzzling flavor ( and perhaps cp ) problems of gravity mediation , but does not usually have a natural wimp ( see however , @xcite ) .",
    "axion dark matter is also potentially problematic in gauge mediation @xcite , especially for direct mediation models of the kind studied recently by two of the authors @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to get the superpartner of the axion to decay in a way that does not spoil nucleosynthesis .",
    "a much more pragmatic reason for interest in these _ dark baryons _ is that they will generically have magnetic , and perhaps electric , dipole moments . as a consequence ,",
    "their signals in terrestrial dark matter detectors are _ very different from those of conventional wimps_. the infrared tail of dipole charge scattering can dramatically change the cross sections for very low recoil energies . as we will see , dark baryons can give low energy signals even for very large masses .",
    "in addition , some of the dipole scattering cross sections are very different for different nuclear targets , and lead to different conclusions in comparing the implications of one experiment for another .",
    "we will , for example , show that there are particular dark baryon parameters that are compatible with _ all _ claims about direct detection experiments , including dama .",
    "more generally , we find that it is typical to have larger rates in dama than in other experiments , because of the properties of iodine , but not always enough to account for the discrepancy between dama and cdms / xenon .",
    "another interesting feature of the infrared tail of dipole scattering is that it allows for rather large masses of the dark baryons , consistent with experimental observations .",
    "since most direct mediation or technicolor models will have dark baryon masses in the range of a few gev to a few tens of tev , this remark is quite significant .",
    "this paper is an update of @xcite , which includes predictions for all current and planned dark matter direct detection experiments .",
    "we have carefully redone the calculations to determine whether disagreements with other papers in the literature were significant , and we verify the results of @xcite are correct .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : dmdm ] we quickly review the theory of fermions with magnetic and electric dipole moments .",
    "we also include the appropriate differential cross sections with nuclei and compare them with the usual differential cross section obtained from a wimp with constant contact interactions .",
    "section [ sec : exp ] discusses the current and planned dark matter direct detection experiments and summarizes the relevant features of each experiment .",
    "sections [ subsec : cdmsxenon ] and [ subsec : dama ] focus on cdms / xenon and dama respectively .",
    "cdms and xenon contour plots for the magnetic and electric dark matter land factors are shown in function of the dark matter mass for several exposures .",
    "dama plots for the magnetic and electric dipole moment modulation amplitudes are shown as functions of the nuclear recoil energy , and are compared to dama data .",
    "finally we discuss the implications of fermionic dark matter with dipole moments and conclude in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "physical parameters and computations are shown in appendix [ app : efflag ] .",
    "the magnetic and electric dipole moment operators for fermionic dark matter ( dm ) are the only dimension @xmath0 operators coupling to the sm and thus are the most relevant operators for fermionic dm direct detection experiments . for a fermionic dm @xmath1 of mass @xmath2 ,",
    "the effective lagrangian is @xcite @xmath3 where the fermionic dm magnetic and electric gyromagnetic ratios are @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively with @xmath6 the dark sector scale and @xmath7 the cp - violating scale . due to the intrinsic p and t violation of the fermionic dm electric dipole moment operator",
    ", the electric dipole moment operator must be suppressed in any model that is consistent with experimental constraints on cp violation .",
    "we have parametrized this suppression by writing the small @xmath8 in terms of a ratio of scales .",
    "we emphasize that there might be models in which cp violation is suppressed instead by powers of a dimensionless coupling . the scale @xmath9 would not then be a threshold for new physics .        the lagrangian equation ( [ eqn : efflag ] ) gives the fermionic dm a magnetic dipole moment @xmath10 and an electric dipole moment @xmath11 consistent with the usual definitions . in strongly - coupled theories the fermionic dm land factors @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 should be numbers of order one while in weakly - coupled theories they should be numbers suppressed by a loop factor .    for direct detection experiments the magnetic and electric dipole moment differential cross sections in the non - relativistic limit in the lab frame",

    "finally @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the appropriate form factors ( see appendix [ app : efflag ] for more details ) . for a dark matter particle of general",
    "spin @xmath25 the cross sections above are multiplied by @xmath26 .",
    "notice that the magnetic dipole moment differential cross section equation ( [ eqn : crossm ] ) has a spin - independent ( si ) and a spin - dependent ( sd ) contribution . the latter comes from the coherent coupling of the magnetic dipole moment with the nuclear charge current in the fermionic dm rest frame .",
    "notice moreover that the si contribution to the magnetic dipole moment differential cross section as well as the electric dipole moment differential cross section have an infrared ( ir ) enhancement .",
    "this is in contrast with the usual constant contact interaction differential cross section for wimps in the non - relativistic limit which is _ not _ enhanced in the ir .",
    "indeed , the differential cross section for s - wave nucleon scattering in the non - relativistic limit is ( see appendix [ app : efflag ] ) @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the total cross section per nucleon while @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the reduced masses of the fermionic dm - nucleus and fermionic dm - nucleon system respectively .",
    "this difference significantly changes the cross section for low nuclear recoil energies .",
    "finally , in order to compare theory with experiment , the total number of events seen for each experiment must be computed from the differential scattering rate per unit detector mass equation ( [ eqn : diffscatrate ] ) . all other relevant physical parameters and computations",
    "are discussed in appendix [ app : efflag ] .",
    "for example the form factors is given by equation ( [ eqn : fcfs ] ) and the fermionic dm speed distribution in the lab frame is given by equation ( [ eqn : dmfv ] ) .    before focusing on the experiments",
    ", we would like to emphasize that the dm energy loss @xmath31 , due to elastic scatterings with the constituents of the earth s atmosphere and the earth s crust , @xmath32 is completely negligible for generic gyromagnetic ratios of the size we assume , contrary to the claim of@xcite . here",
    "@xmath33 is the number of atoms per unit volume in the earth s atmosphere and earth s crust ( which we approximate by silicon only ) , @xmath34 is the distance traveled in the earth s atmosphere and the earth s crust by the fermionic dm before reaching the experiment and @xmath35 is the differential cross section .",
    "the dm loss of energy is several orders of magnitude smaller than the dm initial kinetic energy in the lab rest frame and is therefore unimportant .",
