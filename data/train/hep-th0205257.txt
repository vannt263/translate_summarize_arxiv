    "compactification of euclidean space @xmath7 , such as @xmath8 , famously leads to integral quantization of certain topological charges , such as the usual four - dimensional topological charge commonly associated with instantons . yet",
    "practically since instantons were invented , there have been indications of fractional topological charge @xcite , whose existence could interfere with compactification .",
    "the basic issue we address in this paper is whether compactification for euclidean @xmath0 @xmath1 yang - mills - chern - simons ( ymcs ) theory is a mathematical hypothesis , which could be abandoned , or whether there are dynamical reasons for expecting it .",
    "if the theory has either a chern - simons ( cs ) level @xmath2 less than a critical value @xmath9 for gauge group @xmath10 @xcite , or a fundamental higgs field , there can exist solitons with cs number of @xmath11 , such as sphalerons and distinct linked center vortices , or solitons with arbitrary real cs number , such as writhing center vortices .",
    "a condensate of such solitons , taken naively , violates compactness and , if it has an interpretation at all , requires integrating over all non - compact gauge transformations as collective coordinates .",
    "we find that candidate vacua in the dilute - gas approximation have the lowest energy when the total @xmath3 is integral and @xmath12 is compactified to @xmath13 .",
    "we find an interpretation for this dynamical compactification in terms of a domain - wall `` sphaleron '' supplying enough fractional cs number to compensate for the total cs number of the bulk solitons .    in other circumstances , such as for fractional @xmath14 topological charge ,",
    "dynamical compactification apparently occurs , sometimes through @xcite the formation of a string that joins enough fractional objects so that their total charge is integral . or compactness of center - vortex sheets may ensure @xcite topological confinement of @xmath14 topological charge .",
    "pisarski @xcite claims that tp monopoles in georgi - glashow theory with a cs term added ( ggcs theory ) are joined by strings .",
    "any attempt to separate out a half - integral set of topological charges joined by strings requires the introduction of enough energy to stretch and ultimately break the string .",
    "this in turn supplies new fractional topological charges that enforce compactification .",
    "@xcite argue that in ccgs the long - range monopole fields already decompactify the space and allow arbitrary cs number ; summing over these arbitrary values leads to suppression of tp monopoles . for the condensed - matter analog ,",
    "@xcite challenges the conclusion of @xcite , on different grounds , which are somewhat related to ours . )",
    "more recent developments require modifications of the views of @xcite .",
    "several authors @xcite have pointed out that the tp monopole is actually like a nexus , with its magnetic flux confined into tubes that are , for all practical purposes , the tubes of center vortices .",
    "these tubes , which join a monopole to an anti - monopole , are the natural candidates for the strings pisarski @xcite claims to exist , although his claim is not based on finding any stringlike object in ccgs .",
    "we find no evidence for strings joining sphalerons , and none is expected since if every @xmath0 cross - section of @xmath14 space had an even number of sphalerons , the @xmath14 space would have to have topological charge which is an even integer .",
    "but there is no such restriction in @xmath14 .    in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with a ymcs theory with extra mass terms , which can either be due to quantum effects or added explicitly .",
    "for ymcs theory with no explicit mass terms it has been argued @xcite that if the cs level @xmath2 is less than a critical value @xmath15 , the cs - induced gauge - boson mass is not large enough to cure the infrared instability of the underlying ym theory . in this case a dynamical mass ( equal for all gauge bosons ) is generated just as for the ym theory with no cs term . in ym theory it is known that quantum sphalerons of cs number @xmath11 exist @xcite , as well as center vortices with various cs numbers",
    "@xcite estimates @xmath9 for gauge group @xmath10 .",
    "but for @xmath16 , ymcs with no matter fields is essentially perturbative , and in the same universality class as witten s topological gauge theory @xcite which has only the cs term in the action ; there are no solitons of finite action @xcite .",
    "there are also sphalerons @xcite and center vortices for ym theory with an elementary higgs field in the fundamental representation ; this theory is quite close in behavior to ym theory with no matter fields and @xmath17 .",
    "a fundamental assumption of the present paper is that if these isolated sphalerons or center vortices exist , a condensate of them is allowed , and that we can learn something about this condensate through conventional dilute - gas arguments",
    ". this assumption could fail if the sphalerons are somehow so strongly coupled that the dilute - gas approximation is qualitatively wrong , but it is not our purpose to investigate this possibility .",
    "certainly , lattice evidence for a center vortex condensate in qcd suggests that there is some sense to the dilute - gas approximation .",
    "the sphaleron @xcite is the prototypical example of an isolated non - compact soliton in @xmath0 gauge theory ; it nominally has chern - simons number ( @xmath3 ) of @xmath11 , instead of the integral value demanded by compactification . no apparent problems",
    "arise until one adds a cs term @xcite . for odd cs level @xmath2 ,",
    "an odd number of sphalerons is detectable in the partition function and elsewhere as a non - compact object , which seems to break gauge invariance and in any event leads to peculiar signs for physical objects . in this hybrid theory with integral and odd cs level @xmath2",
    ", we do not admit arbitrary non - compact gauge transformations , but we do admit a condensate of sphalerons , each with @xmath5 . in sectors with an odd number @xmath18 of sphalerons , the total cs number @xmath19 is half - integral and non - compact .",
    "we argue that it is energetically favorable to form a domain - wall `` sphaleron , '' which may live on the surface at infinity and which also carries half - integral cs number .",
    "the total cs number of the explicit sphalerons and the domain wall is now integral , its energy is lowered , and the theory is dynamically compactified .",
    "next we explore the consequences of admitting not only non - compact solitons but also non - compact gauge transformations",
    ". then the cs number of any isolated @xmath0 gauge - theory soliton is essentially arbitrary , since it can be changed by a large non - compact gauge transformation of the form @xmath20;\\;\\;\\alpha ( \\infty )",
    "\\neq 2\\pi n.\\ ] ] this gauge transformation does not change the action ( aside from the cs term itself ) or equations of motion of the soliton , and therefore corresponds to a collective coordinate .",
    "as we will see , integrating over @xmath21 as a collective coordinate does not automatically compactify the space ; it simply gives it a higher vacuum energy density ( and infinitely higher energy for infinite volume ) than it would have if the solitons allowed compactification .",
    "again we expect the energy of the vacuum to be lowered by formation of a domain - wall sphaleron .",
    "the sphaleron is not the only object in @xmath1 @xmath0 ym or ymcs theory with half - integral cs number . in the center vortex - nexus view of gauge theories",
    "@xcite @xmath14 topological charge is carried ( in part ) by the linkage of center vortices and nexuses @xcite ; the @xmath0 projection of such linkages is that center vortices , which are closed fat strings of magnetic flux , carry cs number through mutual linkage as well as the self - linkage of twisting and writhing @xcite of these strings . in their simplest linked configuration , which consists of two untwisted but linked loops",
    "whose distance of closest approach is large compared to the flux - tube thickness , they carry a mutual link number @xmath22 , which is an integer , and a cs number of @xmath23 , just like a sphaleron .",
    "but there are isolated configurations that carry essentially any link or cs number @xcite .",
    "these are individual center vortices with writhe .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for mathematically - idealized ( dirac - string ) vortices",
    ", one can apply calugareanu s theorem , which says that the ribbon - framed self - linking number @xmath24 is an integer and a topological invariant , although not uniquely defined , and that @xmath25 where the writhe @xmath26 is the standard gauss self - linking integral and @xmath27 is the twist or torsion integral .",
    "neither @xmath27 nor @xmath26 is a topological invariant , and neither is restricted to take on integer values . since the cs number is proportional to the writhe , even without making general non - compact gauge transformations , one has the phenomenon of essentially arbitrary cs number for an isolated soliton .",
    "the effect of these center vortices is much the same as if we admit non - compact gauge transformations .",
    "one difference is that for spatially - compact center vortices the cs density is localized , while for non - compact gauge transformations the associated cs density always lies on the surface at infinity .    a center vortex with writhe ]    for physical center vortices , where dirac strings turn into fat tubes of magnetic flux , the same picture holds , although for different reasons . for such fat tubes ,",
    "the standard integrals for @xmath27 and @xmath26 are modified , and there is no sharp distinction between twist and writhe @xcite .",
    "the modified integrals depend on the details of the mechanism that fattens the flux tubes ( which may be thought of as the generation of a dynamical mass by quantum effects arising from infrared instability of the ym theory ) .",
    "there is no reason for @xmath27 or @xmath26 to be integers , or even fractions such as @xmath11 . in physics language ,",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath26 are dependent on collective coordinates of the vortex .",
    "so the situation should be somewhat similar to that for sphalerons .",
    "if cs numbers can take on arbitrary values , how can @xmath14 topological charge , which is the difference of cs numbers , be restricted to integral values ?",
    "the answer , of course , is @xmath14 compactness , which is not related to @xmath0 compactness ; a non - compact @xmath14 space may have only compact @xmath0 cross - sections .",
    "compactness in @xmath14 constrains the cs numbers whose difference is the topological charge , so that not every pair of @xmath0 condensates of cs number can occur in a compact @xmath14 space .",
    "we give some simple examples , analogous to the pairing of crossings ( sphalerons ) in a compact @xmath0 space , to show how these constraints arise .",
    "these examples interpret the net change in cs number as arising from a dynamic reconnection process , in which center vortices change their link number ; only certain kinds of dynamic reconnection are allowed by compactness .",
    "the point of reconnection , when two otherwise distinct vortices have a common point , is simply the point of intersection of center vortices in the previously - studied picture of @xmath14 topological charge as an intersection number of closed vortex surfaces ( plus linkages of these surfaces with nexus world lines ) @xcite ; such intersection points come in pairs for compact vortex surfaces .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    1 .   even if compactification is not assumed _",
    "a priori _ , and solitons possess collective coordinates amounting to arbitrary @xmath3 for every soliton , the lowest - energy candidate vacuum state of a ymcs theory is one which is compact . the energetic favorability of compactification we describe by _ dynamical compactification_. 2 .",
    "there is no evidence for strings that locally bind sphalerons into paired objects ; instead , there is evidence for a domain - wall `` sphaleron '' carrying half - integral cs number if the bulk sphalerons also carry half - integral cs number .",
    "sphalerons can be mapped onto over- and under - crossings of knots occuring in closed fictitious abelian field lines associated with the non - abelian cs term .",
    "there is always an even number of crossings for compact knots , and so an odd number of crossings of closed knot components must be compensated by an odd number of crossings elsewhere .",
    "the domain - wall sphaleron acts as a superconducting wall that confines the closed fictitious field lines to a compact domain , where they must close and have an integral cs number .",
    "fat self - linked center vortices can also carry arbitrary @xmath3 associated with collective coordinates ; we expect phenomena similar to those found for sphalerons .",
    "5 .   for a compact @xmath14 condensate of center vortices and nexuses ,",
    "living in the product of a @xmath0 space and a ( euclidean ) `` time '' variable , possible time - dependent reconnection of vortices that would change link numbers is constrained by compactness to yield integral topological charge .",
    "6 .   if fermions are added , we show that half - integral fermion number and half - integral cs number go together , and identify an extra fermion number of @xmath11 with a fermion zero mode at infinity , which is a zero mode of the domain - wall sphaleron at infinity .",
    "this result generalizes to the case of arbitrary cs number as well .",
    "7 .   in the ggcs model , strings exist that bind tp monopoles to tp anti - monopoles and restore compactification ; these strings are essentially those of center vortices , while the tp monopoles are like nexuses .",
    "in this section we establish notation , review the properties of solitons with the usual spherical _ ansatz _ in massive ymcs theory , and remark that every configuration in the functional integral for ymcs theory has a conjugate related by a euclidean cpt - like transformation .",
    "the action of ymcs is complex , so its classical solitons can be complex too",
    ". then the cs action @xmath28 defined in eq .",
    "( [ csaction ] ) below may be complex , and its real part is not interpretable as a cs number .",
    "we will always define @xmath29 , where the integer @xmath2 is the cs level .",
    "in general a large gauge transformation only changes the imaginary part of @xmath28 , and so this identification makes sense .",
    "but one may also ask whether it makes sense at all to discuss complex solitons as extrema of the action ; certainly , as pisarski @xcite points out , this is quite wrong in some circumstances .",
    "the other possibility is to use only solitons of the real part of the action , and simply evaluate the cs term at these solitons .",
    "of course , this works fine in @xmath14 , where the theta term adds nothing to the equations of motion .",
    "@xcite argues that in ymcs there is a complex ( but self - conjugate ) spherically - symmetric soliton much like a sphaleron ; the particular case studied there had purely real cs action and hence no cs number .",
    "we show here that the would - be sphaleron of ref .",
    "@xcite can easily be promoted to a sphaleron with @xmath3= @xmath11 .",
    "one knows @xcite that with no cs term , @xmath0 ym theory with no matter terms is infrared - unstable and non - perturbative , requiring the dynamical generation of a gluon mass @xmath30 of order @xmath31 for gauge group @xmath10 , where @xmath32 is the gauge coupling .",
    "if this theory is extended to ymcs theory , it appears ( at least from one - loop calculations @xcite ) that the chern - simons gauge - boson mass @xmath33 is too small to cure the infrared instability , and so generation of dynamical mass is still required .",
    "the estimates of the critical level @xmath15 are based on one - loop calculations of the gauge - invariant pinch - technique ( pt ) gauge - boson propagator @xcite and may not be very accurate , but unpublished estimates of two - loop corrections by one of us ( jmc ) suggest that the existence of a finite @xmath15 is well - established .",
    "the one - loop calculations give @xmath34 for @xmath1 .",
    "the generation of a dynamical mass generally leads to confinement , via the creation of a condensate of center vortices @xcite and nexuses @xcite .",
    "the long - range effects essential for confinement come from pure - gauge parts that disorder the wilson loop ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , give it an area law ) by fluctuations in the gauss linking number of vortices and the wilson loop .",
    "define the usual anti - hermitean @xmath1 gauge - potential matrix with the gauge coupling @xmath32 incorporated by : @xmath35 where the component form @xmath36 is the canonical gauge potential .",
    "the euclidean ym action is : @xmath37 to this can be added the chern - simons action : @xmath38.\\ ] ] the sum @xmath39 is the ymcs action @xmath40 . throughout this paper",
    "we will define the cs number @xmath3 as the _ real _ part of the integral in eq .",
    "[ csaction ] : @xmath41 it is only from this real part that phase or gauge - invariance problems can arise .",

    ", the cs mass may not be large enough to cure the infrared instabilities of ymcs with no matter fields , and a dynamical mass is generated .",
    "this mass is the same for all gauge bosons .",

    "this dynamical - mass effective action is the same , for our purposes , as if one added a fundamental higgs field , as in the weinberg electroweak action .    because the action is complex , in general we must deal with complex values for the gauge potentials and matter fields",

    ", there is no reason to restrict the path integral to real fields .",
    "there is an elementary theorem , essentially a euclidean cpt theorem , applicable to complex ymcs gauge fields and any scalar fields , such as the fields @xmath56 of the gg model discussed later . given any configuration of gauge and scalar fields for which the actions evaluated on this configuration have the values @xmath57 ,",
    "we define a conjugate configuration by : @xmath58 or in component language : @xmath59 the possible sign change of the scalar field @xmath60 reflects any intrinsic parity .",
    "then the cpt - transformed configuration has actions @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "note that @xmath3 changes sign under conjugation .    below we will look for solitons of the ymcs action plus matter terms .",
    "generally these solitons , like the action itself , will be complex .",
    "they can be divided into two types : 1 ) those configurations that transform into themselves under cpt , which we call self - conjugate , and 2 ) those that transform to another configuration .",
    "self - conjugate configurations have _ real _ action , including the cs term .",
    "it is easy to see that if any configuration of type 2 ) satisfies the complex equations of motion then so does its cpt conjugate , and both are admissible solitons if either is .",
    "examples of type 1 ) solitons are given in @xcite , for the ymcs action with dynamical mass generation .",
    "these solitons can not be said to possess topological properties as expressed through the cs term , since the cs number @xmath3 vanishes .",
    "however , from this self - conjugate soliton it is easy to generate solitons that are not self - conjugate with any desired cs number .",
    "we review the sphaleron - like complex soliton @xcite of the action @xmath65 ( see equations ( [ action ] , [ dynmass ] ) ) . using the notation of @xcite , a spherical soliton",
    "is described by four functions of @xmath66 : @xmath67 @xmath68 the equations of motion , found by varying both @xmath69 and @xmath45 , are : @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73^{\\prime}-\\frac{2}{r^2}(\\phi_1\\sin \\beta + \\phi_2 \\cos \\beta ) \\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the chern - simons mass at level @xmath2 and the prime signifies differentiation with respect to @xmath66 .",
    "these equations reduce to those of @xcite at @xmath75 . as in @xcite , eq . ( [ eom4 ] ) , which is the variational equation for @xmath45 , is not independent of the other three equations .",
    "it can be derived from them by simple manipulations because there is still an abelian gauge degree of freedom : @xmath76 the boundary conditions are : @xmath77    first consider the case @xmath75 .",
    "then @xcite there is a solution where @xmath78 is real and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are pure imaginary .",
    "this corresponds to a self - conjugate soliton , so the cs action is purely real ( that is , the cs integral @xmath81 in eq . ( [ csaction ] ) is pure imaginary ) .",
    "this is easily checked from the explicit form @xmath82.\\ ] ]    if any solution of the equations of motion is gauge - transformed as in eq .",
    "( [ abelg ] ) , it remains a solution to these equations and all contributions to the action are unchanged except , of course , for the cs part of the action . if we start with the self - conjugate soliton above , and transform it with a function @xmath83 such that @xmath84 one sees that the soliton is no longer self - conjugate , and in general all three functions @xmath85 are complex .",
    "this choice of boundary conditions for @xmath86 removes an integrable singularity in the original self - conjugate sphaleron , but does not change the ym and mass parts of the action . the change in the cs integral , because it does not affect the equations of motion , is necessarily a surface term : @xmath87 the new sphaleron has @xmath5 , as appropriate for a sphaleron .",
    "the immediate objection is that one could as well choose any value for @xmath21 , and change the sphaleron s cs number to any desired value .",
    "integration over this collective coordinate might cause sphalerons to be confined in pairs ( as argued in @xcite for tp monopoles in the ggcs model ) .",
    "however , it does not quite happen that way for sphalerons .",
    "we next show that integrating over @xmath88 for all sphalerons does increase the free energy , but does not lead immediately to confinement of sphalerons in pairs .",
    "in such a case , compactification becomes the preferred state dynamically .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , sphalerons ( and center vortices ) present a challenge to the usual view of compact ymcs , since these solitons in isolation violate compactness and lead to problems with gauge invariance . in this section we consider several cases , beginning with the internally - inconsistent but instructive case in which @xmath2 is integral and only compact gauge transformations area allowed but there is a condensate of ( non - compact ) sphalerons . for odd @xmath2 the energy density of the vacuum",
    "is changed in sign from the case of even @xmath2 , which raises the vacuum energy by an infinite amount . in the next case",
    ", @xmath2 is still an integer but we allow large gauge transformations of the form @xmath89 $ ] with arbitrary @xmath21 . since the action of a sphaleron depends on @xmath83 only through the cs phase factor , this variable can be treated as a collective coordinate and integrated over .",
    "we will see that this integral again raises the free energy , suggesting that the compactified theory is preferred on energetic grounds .",
    "finally , we consider the case of general @xmath2 , including spatially - variable @xmath2 , and non - compact gauge transformations and find , analogous to lscher s work @xcite in @xmath14 , that if @xmath2 takes on a non - integral value in a bounded domain and an integral value outside it , this domain or `` bag '' has a positive energy , scaling with the bag volume , above the integral-@xmath2 vacuum .",
    "this last case gives us a clue to what actually causes the ostensibly non - compact theory to compactify .",
    "we find no evidence for strings that would join pairs of sphalerons together , nor do the collective coordinate integrations reduce the theory to the zero - sphaleron sector .",
    "instead , we argue in sec .",
    "[ knotsec ] that among the collective coordinates for large gauge transformations with any value of @xmath90 , there is the possibility of formation of a domain - wall sphaleron that places half - integral cs number on a closed surface surrounding an odd number of sphalerons , to add to the half - integral cs number present from the sphalerons inside .",
    "this domain wall itself has no energy , and is a pure - gauge object ; it can be moved around , deformed , and so on , without changing the physics .",
    "it acts as a superconducting wall that causes the fictitious abelian field lines associated with non - abelian cs number to be confined to the interior of the domain wall , or in other words to be compact .",
    "our arguments are based on the assumption that a condensate of sphalerons in ymcs theory can be treated in the dilute - gas approximation , or equivalently that all solitons are essentially independent .",
    "when a cs term is present in the action , the partition function @xmath91 is the usual expansion as a sum over sectors of different sphaleron number : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the partition function in the sector with @xmath18 sphalerons ; the subscript @xmath94 indicates a sum over collective coordinates of the sphalerons ; @xmath95 is the action ( including cs action ) of a sphaleron and the omitted terms indicate corrections to the dilute - gas approximation . to be more explicit , we separate the sum over collective coordinates into kinematic coordinates , such as spatial position , and gauge collective coordinates .",

    "so the non - compactified theory has in a higher free energy than the compactified theory .",
    "( non - compactification also leads to a number of other unphysical results in the dilute - gas approximation , which we will not dwell on here . )    now consider the case of non - compact gauge transformations .",

    "since the fictitious field lines are closed , this can only happen if the field lines run along the surface of the sphere @xmath164 and at some point return to the vicinity of the sphaleron and close .",
    "schematically , the field lines look like those depicted in fig .",
    "the bounding surface @xmath164 acts as a superconductor for the abelian field lines .",
    "( of course , this bounding surface need not literally be a sphere , but it can be any surface with the topology of @xmath145 that encloses the sphaleron . )",
    "once the field lines are compactified in this way , there is no problem interpreting the hopf invariant in terms of linkages of two of this family of closed curves . on the other hand , if @xmath165 never reaches @xmath162 , it is easy to see from the explicit form of eq .",
    "( [ abelsphb ] ) that the field lines never return to the vicinity of the sphaleron , but continue on to infinity .",
    "a third important property is that in the vicinity of the sphaleron the field lines are sheared so that any two lines , projected into a plane , cross each other .",
    "below we will interpret this crossing as a contribution to the linkage of knotted field lines .",

    "this suggests that in some sense a sphaleron is the topological equivalent of a single crossing , with ( as one quickly checks ) an even number of crossings needed for describing the linkage of closed compact curves .",
    "of course , since a sphaleron is localized , one needs to interpret the crossings in figs . 1 or 2 as being infinitesimally separated .",
    "this in itself is not necessary for understanding the topology but it is necessary for interpreting the topology in terms of localized sphalerons",

    "( [ stline ] ) by which the two components are separated out of the plane at their crossing points , that is , whether there is an overcrossing or an undercrossing .",
    "as long as one presents the knots as being quasi - two - dimensional , which means that their components lie in one plane except for infinitesimal displacements into the third dimension for crossings , there are no other contributions to the integral for @xmath22 , because the triple product in its definition vanishes for curves lying in a plane . as a result , in the present interpretation of link number , the link number can be thought of as being localized , in units of @xmath11 , to points where the components of the knot appear to cross .",
    "this is quite similar to the interpretation in @xmath14 @xcite of @xmath1 topological charge as occurring in localized units of @xmath11 .",

    "if there is an odd number of explicit crossings in any finite region , then compactification requires a domain - wall sphaleron , which acts as a superconducting wall for the abelian field lines , compactifying them , and induces an odd number of extra crossings so that the total number of crossings is even .",
    "any compact knot possesses an even number of crossings and hence an integral cs number .",

    "this mode may be interpreted as the normalizable zero mode of a sphaleron at infinity .",
    "we have brought earlier work on the behavior of tp monopoles in ggcs theory up to date , by noting that whether there is a cs term or not added to the gg action , the screening of tp monopole fields by the meissner effect or by the generation of dynamical mass leads to tubes of flux , essentially center vortex tubes , joining every monopole to an anti - monopole .",
    "the result is a compactified theory .    the general conclusion ,",
