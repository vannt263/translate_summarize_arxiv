    "our simulations at larger masses show that the transit radius lies close to the 100 mbar level for @xmath148 .    according to formation and structure models of hot ( @xmath81000k ) sub - neptunes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "atmospheric masses corresponding to the radii given in table  1 were estimated from the 1000k structure models of @xcite .",

    "[ fig : evolution ] , the atmosphere structure would be modified in a short time .",
    "it is also not possible that corot-24b is the remnant of a more massive planet ( e.g. , hot - jupiter or hot - saturn ) , because the escape rates of such massive objects are not high enough to affect significantly the planet s mass over the main - sequence lifetime of the host star @xcite .",
    "both escape rates , i.e. @xmath65 and @xmath66 , depend on the adopted euv flux and heating efficiency @xmath69 .",
    "for this reason we tested the effect of a higher / lower euv flux or @xmath69 on the results .",
    "a different euv flux affects both @xmath65 and @xmath66 rates in a similar , though not identical , way .",
    "a variation of a factor of @xmath82 in the euv flux would lead to a variation on the @xmath67 ratio of @xmath80.3 , which in terms of planetary radius corresponds to @xmath50.1 .",
    "variations in @xmath69 also affect both escape rates . in this case",
    "we estimate that a factor of @xmath82 difference in the heating efficiency would lead to a variation on the planetary radius of @xmath50.1 . from the comparison of the escape rates of the hot - jupiter hd209458b described in sect .",
    "[ sec : modelling ] we expect that the use of a different hydrodynamic code would lead to mass - loss rates consistent with those presented here within a factor of @xmath82 , which , in terms of the derived planetary radius of corot-24b , corresponds to @xmath80.1 .",
    "we further tested the effect of varying  ( 1070@xmath9140k ; * ? ? ? * ) , finding that variations in  up to 200k have a negligible impact on the results .",
    "on the basis of planetary formation models calculated for planets in the 110  range , one can estimate the core radius @xmath76 of a planet on the basis of its mass if @xmath83 as @xmath84 , depending upon the exact composition @xcite .",
    "taking into account that , hence the 100 mbar level , can not be too close to @xmath76 ( the planet needs sufficient atmosphere to produce the observed ) , from fig .",
    "[ fig : lhyvslen ] it follows that corot-24b should have a minimum mass of @xmath85.0 , with a core radius in the @xmath81.551.68  range and  at the 100 mbar level in the @xmath81.92.2  range .",
    "these values yield an average density of 2.94.6g@xmath11 .",

    "we conclude therefore that , accounting for the uncertainties on , the `` true '' radius @xmath86 of corot-24b is @xmath830 - 60% smaller than the one measured by the transit . for the solar system gas giant planets ,",
    "is by definition set at the 1bar pressure level . by setting this pressure level at  and following the same procedure described in sect .",
    "[ sec : indentifying ] , we obtained again that  would be about 2.2   ( see fig .  [ fig : lhyvslen ] ) .",

    "the atmosphere is hydrostatic near , while it becomes hydrodynamic and cools adiabatically above 5 . for the cooler and more massive planet , corot-24c",
    ", the atmosphere is hydrostatic above  and the temperature increases up to 3000k due to the euv heating . above 10",
    "the atmosphere cools adiabatically . for corot-24b ,",
    "[ fig : profiles ] shows that assuming = 2.2  and = 5.7 ,  lies near the 110@xmath87bar pressure level .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] , the absorption at the level of the transit radius can not be caused by h@xmath13 rayleigh scattering and the alkali lines are too narrow to produce broad - band absorption . at such a high altitude , absorption could be for example produced by clouds , though cloud formation models based on tio@xmath13 calculated for hd189733b (  similar to that of corot-24b ) suggest formation pressures of about 0.1 mbar @xcite .",
    "by comparing the escape rates obtained from a hydrodynamic code with the maximum possible euv - driven escape rate calculated from the energy - limited formula , we discovered that for the h@xmath88-dominated close - in sub - neptune corot-24b the planetary radius , by definition set at the 100 mbar pressure level , is 30 - 60% smaller than the observed transit radius .",
    "additional considerations on the range of possible planetary core radii allowed us to constrain the most likely values of the planetary mass and radius to lie in the range 5.05.7  and 1.92.2 , respectively .",
    "the kepler satellite has discovered several similar , low - density `` sub - neptunes '' and it is very likely that the transit radii measured for the vast majority of these planets also differs from the true planetary radius , therefore introducing a systematic bias in the measured radii .",
    "this has dramatic implications for example in the determination of the mass - radius relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and for planet population synthesis studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our results may also help explaining some of the discrepancies discovered between the planet radius distribution observed by kepler and that derived from population synthesis models @xcite .",
    "this has also profound implications for our understanding of the structure of the large number of transiting low - mass exoplanets expected to be observed and discovered in the near future by the cheops , tess , and plato space missions and characterized by jwst .",
