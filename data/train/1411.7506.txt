    "unconventional superconductors including cuprates , iron - based systems , and heavy fermion materials constitute interesting classes of materials that currently evade quantitative theoretical modelling@xcite .",
    "a fundamental outstanding question is , of course , the origin of the superconducting phase itself . for most of these materials",
    ", the superconductivity takes place in close proximity to a magnetically ordered phase which may coexist with superconductivity in a limited doping range . for the cuprates ,",
    "this coexistence region has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically on both the electron- and hole - doped sides of the phase diagram . in the latter case ,",
    "the so - called stripe order and its effects on superconductivity remain an active area of research.@xcite    for the iron - based materials , a magnetic @xmath0 stripe ordered phase generally precedes the superconducting phase .",
    "the emergence of a coexistence region of static magnetic and superconducting order at intermediate doping levels depends on the particular material family ; whereas the 122 systems exhibit a coexistence region at the foot of the magnetic dome@xcite , this is not the case for most of the 1111 compounds ( sm-1111 being an exception.@xcite ) for both hole- and electron - doped ba-122 , the coexistence region has been extensively studied and constitutes a topic of controversy with some measurements suggesting meso - scale phase separation while others indicate microscopic coexistence.@xcite initial measurements suggested that k substitution ( hole doping , out - of - plane ions ) led to phase separation@xcite whereas more recent experiments are in agreement with microscopic coexistence.@xcite co substitution ( electron doping , in - plane ions ) in the underdoped regime of ba-122 seems to produce microscopic phase coexistence where superconducting and magnetic orders compete for the same electronic states.@xcite the latter is in agreement with neutron diffraction measurements finding a reduction of the magnetic bragg peak intensity upon entering the superconducting state,@xcite even though changes of the volume fraction can produce the same effect .",
    "most recent experimental studies find that co doped ba-122 samples exhibit volume - full coexistence at @xmath1 , while above this doping level superconductivity and magnetism do not coexist microscopically , but rather consist of inhomogeneous distributions of frozen ( or slowly fluctuating ) magnetic islands in the superconducting host.@xcite a recent @xmath2as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) study , consistent with this latter scenario , found an inhomogeneous cluster spin glass coexisting with superconductivity up to @xmath3@xcite in agreement with earlier muon spin rotation ( @xmath4sr ) measurements.@xcite a similar short - range cluster spin glass phase has been also recently found near optimal ( electron ) doping in ni - doped ba-122.@xcite    the experimental results discussed in the above section exemplifies well the fascinating parameter dependence of the iron pnictides ; the properties of the resulting many - particle ground state depend on the particular compound and the specific doping method .",
    "other recent examples of this behavior includes several mn - substituted samples revealing unusual competitive effects between magnetism and superconductivity as well as the emergence of new high - temperature impurity - induced magnetic phases.@xcite    it is important to further study the coexistence region of the iron pnictides because it can provide crucial information about the ground state properties of these systems .",
    "this is evident , for example , in the fact that the detailed superconducting gap structure inside and outside the coexistence region are closely linked.@xcite furthermore , theoretical studies find that the mere presence of the coexistence region is evidence for @xmath5 pairing symmetry of the superconducting phase and incommensurability of the magnetic order.@xcite hence , the coexistence region can be used as a guide for theoretical models , since the competition between the superconducting and magnetic orders can only be obtained with the correct gap structure , and a complete quantitative description requires correct orbital content of the order parameters as well . for the case of ba-122",
    "there is an additional interesting question of what happens to the two distinct transitions , magnetic versus nematic - structural , in the coexistence phase.@xcite theoretically , a quantitative theory of superconducting pairing from spin fluctuations in the coexistence phase is highly complex , especially for multi - band iron - based materials , due to the folding of the fermi surfaces by the magnetic ordering .",
    "only a limited number of microscopic studies exist for the calculation of pairing potentials within the symmetry - broken sdw phase.@xcite    exploring the consequences of external magnetic fields in the coexistence region constitutes a probe of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism . in the cuprates",
    ", neutron scattering has revealed that application of an external magnetic field perpendicular to the cuo@xmath6 planes causes a pronounced enhancement of the elastic incommensurate ( stripe ) magnetic order at doping levels in a range : @xmath7@xcite at larger doping values , the static stripe order is absent , but can be induced by application of a magnetic field.@xcite for the iron pnictides , the influence of a magnetic field on the neutron scattering cross section is less explored at present .",
    "previous neutron studies on ni - doped ba-122 mainly focussed on the effects of an external magnetic field in reducing the neutron resonance in the inelastic response.@xcite similar results were obtained for the resonance in the superconducting state of fese@xmath8te@xmath9.@xcite for underdoped ba(fe@xmath10ni@xmath11as@xmath6 , the influence of an in - plane magnetic field on the static ( but short - range ) antiferromagnetism was investigated recently by wang _",
    "et al._,@xcite who found field - enhanced static antiferromagnetic scattering below the superconducting critical transition temperature @xmath12 k at the expense of spectral weight at the resonance .",
    "open questions remain , however , about the field dependence of the magnetic and superconducting volume fractions discernible only by local probes .    here",
    "we perform a systematic neutron and @xmath4sr experimental study combined with theoretical modelling of the interplay between magnetic and superconducting order in the coexistence region of .",
    "we verify earlier experimental studies of this composition in finding a nano - scale coexistence of magnetic and superconducting orders exhibiting strong competition as a function of temperature.@xcite more specifically , the magnetic moments are strongly suppressed below @xmath13 .",
    "however , as a function of external magnetic field the magnetism can be recovered similar to what has been observed for the cuprates.@xcite using a microscopic model with realistic band structure and including superconductivity and magnetic correlations , we explain the experimental observations .",
    "in particular , we show how vortices in the superconducting condensate can locally pin magnetic @xmath0 ordered regions giving rise to the field - enhanced static magnetic scattering in the superconducting state .",

    "however , no evidence of incommensurability was found in this sample , the antiferromagnetic bragg peaks are resolution limited.@xcite the doping range between @xmath29 in ba-122 is generally referred to as the coexistence region . here ,",
    "both neutron scattering@xcite and transverse field @xmath4sr@xcite measurements provide clear evidence for a direct competition between the superconducting and magnetic order parameters on a nanometer scale .",
    "the magnetic order parameter is anomalously suppressed below @xmath13 and the excellent agreement between neutron diffraction and transverse field @xmath4sr , which unlike neutron diffraction is a local probe , suggests that both techniques probe the same magnetic state,@xcite which must then persist throughout the whole crystal .",
    "in addition , neutron diffraction excludes the possibility that the suppression of the magnetic order parameter could be due to a magnetic phase transition or a spin reorientation.@xcite    infrared optical spectroscopy performed on clearly shows that the superconducting energy gap exists for all electronic states@xcite at low temperature . at the same time , the magnetic volume fraction extracted from @xmath4sr measurements are found to be @xmath30,@xcite see also fig .",
