    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) are a new mysterious class of radio transients observed at frequencies around @xmath12 .",
    "they are characterized by short intrinsic durations ( @xmath13 ) , large dispersion measures ( @xmath14 ) , and high galactic latitudes @xcite .",
    "the observed dms have a large excess with respect to the galactic value in the high galactic latitude directions from which the frbs are observed , suggesting an extragalactic or even a cosmological origin @xcite . the observed dm should have a large contribution from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "if redshifts of frbs can be measured , one may combine the dm and @xmath0 information to perform cosmological studies @xcite . claimed @xcite .",
    "the case is however controversial @xcite . ]    in previous works @xcite , in order to constrain the cosmological parameters with frb observations , one needs to first subtract the host galaxy contribution , @xmath15 ( which includes contributions from the host galaxy interstellar medium and the plasma associated with the frb source ) , from the observed value , dm@xmath16 , in order to obtain the dm from the intergalactic medium , @xmath17 .",
    "if one has @xmath17 and redshift @xmath0 measured for a sample of frbs , many interesting cosmological applications are possible .",
    "however , @xmath15 is a poorly known parameter , which depends on the type of the host galaxy , the site of frb in the host galaxy , the inclination angle of the galaxy disk , and the near - source plasma contribution @xcite .",
    "another complication is @xmath17 depends on @xmath18 @xcite , where @xmath19 is the current baryon mass density fraction of the universe and @xmath20 is the fraction of baryon mass in the intergalactic medium .",
    "both values have to be inferred from other cosmological observations .    in this paper , we study the first derivative of the @xmath21 relation , and find that the @xmath22 slope ( where @xmath23 is the extragalactic dispersion measure of the frb ) , @xmath24 , can be used to infer @xmath25 .",
    "we further show that @xmath26 and cosmological parameters ( @xmath9 in @xmath10cdm cosmology and @xmath11 ) can be independently inferred by applying a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) fit to a sample of frbs whose dm and @xmath0 are measured .",
    "the observed dispersion measure of an frb is given by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath17 and @xmath15 denote the contributions from the milk way , intergalactic medium and the frb host galaxy ( including interstellar medium of the host and the near - source plasma ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath28 can be well constrained with the galactic pulsar data @xcite , and is a strong function of the galactic latitude @xmath29 , e.g. @xmath30 for @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for @xmath33 . for a well - localized frb",
    ", @xmath28 can be extracted with reasonable certainty .",
    "we then define extragalactic dispersion measure of an frb as @xmath34    since @xmath35 is consistent with essentially all observational constraints , in the rest of the paper we focus on this model with @xmath36 enforced .",
    "considering local inhomogeneity of igm , we define the mean dispersion measure of the igm , which is given by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 @xmath39 is the current hubble constant , @xmath19 is the current baryon mass density fraction of the universe , @xmath20 is the fraction of baryon mass in the intergalactic medium , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the hydrogen and helium mass fractions normalized to 3/4 and 1/4 , respectively , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the ionization fractions for hydrogen and helium , respectively . for frbs at @xmath45 , both hydrogen and helium",
    "are fully ionized @xcite .",
    "one then has @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .    in an effort of investigating the first derivative of the @xmath21 relation ,",
    "we first define @xmath48 since @xmath47 for @xmath45 , @xmath49 essentially depends only on the cosmological parameters @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath51 relation and @xmath49 as a function of @xmath0 are presented in fig.[fig1 ] for @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "one can see that @xmath49 is around 1 at @xmath53 .",
    "it initially rises and monotonically decreases with @xmath0 after reaching a peak .",
    "observationally , one can not directly measure @xmath17 , so that @xmath49 can not be directly measured .",
    "since @xmath54 and @xmath0 are the directly measured parameters , we next define @xmath55 in view of the dispersion of both @xmath56 and @xmath57 in different directions at a same @xmath0 , we have introduced the average values @xmath58 and @xmath59 at redshift @xmath0 ( in practice they are the average values in a certain redshift bin centered around @xmath0 ) . for a host galaxy at redshift @xmath0 , due to cosmological redshift and time dilation",
    ", its observed @xmath15 is a factor of @xmath60 of the local one @xmath61 @xcite . if we assume that the properties of frb host galaxies have no significant evolution with redshift , then @xmath62 , and @xmath63 one can see that due to the non - zero value of @xmath64 and a @xmath0-dependent @xmath65 , @xmath66 shows a different behavior from @xmath67 ( fig.[fig2 ] ) : @xmath68 for @xmath69 , and @xmath70 for @xmath71 .    since for standard cosmological parameters , @xmath72 at @xmath53 , one can estimate @xmath64 using a sample of frbs at low redshifts .",
    "let us consider a sample of frbs with @xmath73 . according to eq.([beta ] )",
    ", one can derive @xmath74 where the over - line symbols denote an average over all the frbs in the sample at @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the slope of linear fitting in the @xmath0 range in log - log space .",
    "in particular , for @xmath69 , one has @xmath77 one can see that a sample of frbs at low @xmath0 would give a rough estimate of the host galaxy dm , @xmath64 .",
    "on the other hand , due to @xmath78 at @xmath79 , one has @xmath80 , which means that one can obtain the cosmological parameters by measuring @xmath5 at high redshift .",
    "in particular , for flat @xmath10cdm models , @xmath5 at high-@xmath0 would give a direct measure of @xmath9 .",
    "finally , the absolute value of @xmath65 at a given @xmath0 depends on the @xmath81 parameter ( eq.([eq : k ] ) ) .",
    "_ as a result , the three unknown parameters , @xmath82 , @xmath9 , and @xmath81 , are defined by different properties of the @xmath22 plot , and therefore can be independently inferred from the @xmath83 data of a sample of frbs . _",
    "to prove this , in this section we apply monte carlo simulations to show that one can use the mcmc method to infer the three unknown parameters .",
    "we adopt the flat @xmath84 parameters recently derived from the _ plank _ data : @xmath85 @xcite . for the fraction of baryon mass in igm",
    ", we adopt @xmath86 @xcite . as a result",
    ", one has @xmath87 .",
    "we assume that the redshift distribution of frbs satisfies @xmath88 @xcite , a phenomenological model for grb redshift distribution .",
    "since grbs trace star formation history of universe , this model may stand for all frb models invoking associations of frbs with star formation .",
    "the true redshift distribution of frbs depends on the underlying progenitor system(s ) of frbs , which can take different forms from this simple formula ( e.g. for the @xmath0 distributions tracing star formation or compact star mergers , see approximate analytical expressions in @xcite ) . however , different models only slightly modify the distributions of @xmath0 of the simulated samples , but would not affect the global shape and scatter of the @xmath22 plot we are modeling . as a result , for the purpose of the simulations here , the explicit form of @xmath0 distribution does not affect the results .",
    "we generate a population of @xmath89 frbs at different redshifts between @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the redshift cutoff . at higher redshifts @xmath92",
    ", frbs might be too dim to detect .",
    "also larger dm values would make the pulses more dispersed to evade detection .",
    "because @xmath28 is reasonably known , we simulate @xmath93 .",
    "we assume a normal distribution of @xmath94 ) , where @xmath95 is given by eq.([dmigm ] ) and its random fluctuation @xmath96 is adopted .",
    "the distribution of @xmath61 is also assumed as normal .",
    "we simulate a number of @xmath89 frbs , and apply the model to blindly search for input parameters .",
    "the likelihood for the fitting parameters is determined by @xmath97 statistics , i.e. @xmath98 ^ 2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 represents the sequence of frb in the sample .",
    "we minimize @xmath97 , and then convert @xmath97 into a probability density function .",
    "we use the software _ _ emcee _ _ to obtain the probability distribution of the fitting parameters . to test the goodness of the method",
    ", we assumed that @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and simulated two samples of frbs . the first sample has @xmath102 and the latter has @xmath103 .",
    "the analysis results are presented in the top panel of fig.[fig3 ] for @xmath102 , which give @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "these values are all close to the initial input parameters , suggesting that the mcmc method is a powerful tool to extract the three unknown parameters . for @xmath103 , as shown in the bottom panel of fig.[fig3 ] , we obtain @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 . the results are even closer to the input values . in fig.[fig3 ] , the contours are shown at 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , and 2 @xmath110 , respectively .    in order to analyze the effect of @xmath91 , we perform simulations with @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath101 and @xmath103 . for @xmath111 , as shown in the top panel of fig.[fig4 ] , we obtain @xmath107 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . for @xmath112 , as shown in the bottom panel of fig.[fig4 ] , we obtain @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "one can see that the results are still close to the input values , even for lower cutoff values at @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "next , we test how the range of @xmath82 affects the results .",
    "we fix @xmath100 and @xmath103 , and perform simulations with @xmath118 and @xmath119 . for @xmath118 , as shown in the top panel of fig.[fig5 ] , we obtain @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 . for @xmath119 , as shown in the bottom panel of fig.[fig5 ] , we obtain @xmath107 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "our results show that for a certain average value , a larger random fluctuation @xmath125 leads to a larger systematic error of @xmath64 , but the inferred parameters are still close to the input values . on the other hand , for a certain @xmath125",
    ", the average value has little effect on the systematic error of @xmath64 but does affect that of @xmath126 .",
    "in this paper , we discuss how to apply dm and @xmath0 information of future frbs to study cosmology .",
    "different from previous methods @xcite , we do not need to assume the very uncertain host galaxy contribution to dm in the frb sample .",
    "instead , we show that by considering the slope parameter @xmath5 , one may estimate the mean value of host dm , @xmath127 , using a sample of low-@xmath0 frbs . combining with frbs detected at relatively high-@xmath0 ( @xmath128 )",
    ", one may also constrain @xmath9 ( within the framework of the flat @xmath10cdm model ) and @xmath81 ( and hence , @xmath11 ) .",
    "this is because the three parameters mainly define three different properties of the @xmath129 relation : @xmath9 defines the high-@xmath0 slope , @xmath81 defines the global normalization ( @xmath130-interception ) of the plot in the high-@xmath0 regime , and @xmath82 ( along with @xmath81 ) defines the low-@xmath0 slope and normalization .",
    "we perform monte carlo simulations to verify our claim , and find that @xmath82 and cosmological parameters can be indeed extracted from a sample of frb using mcmc fitting .",
    "deriving @xmath82 from the data plays an essential role to identify the progenitor systems of frbs . in our definition",
    ", @xmath82 includes the interstellar medium of the frb host galaxy and near - source plasma .",
    "if frb hosts are milky - way - like , since most frbs come out from high latitudes from their host galaxies , the contribution from the host ism would be much less than @xmath131 .",
    "if one measures @xmath132 in the future , the main contribution of @xmath82 would be from the near - source plasma .",
    "the value of @xmath64 would therefore place constraints on the various frb models proposed in the literature @xcite .    obtaining a reasonably large sample of frbs with @xmath0 measurements may not be easy , due to the lack of a bright counterpart in other electromagnetic wavelengths hours after the burst @xcite .",
    "there are three possibilities to identify frb redshifts in the future : 1 . with very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi )",
    "observations , one may pin down the precise location ( and therefore a possible host galaxy ) of an frb , especially for dedicated observations on the repeating frbs such as frb 121102 @xcite ; 2 . shorten the delay time of follow - up observations , and try to perform multi - wavelength follow - up observations within minutes after the frb trigger to catch the afterglow in the brightest phase @xcite ; 3 . appeal to operation of wide - field frb search and wide - field x - ray , optical surveys to increase chance coincidence of detecting frb counterparts during the prompt phase to catch the bright early afterglow @xcite or prompt frb emission in other wavelengths @xcite . in any case , in the next few years , a few reasonable host galaxy candidates within the positional uncertainty of some frbs may become available , so that the analysis proposed in this _",
