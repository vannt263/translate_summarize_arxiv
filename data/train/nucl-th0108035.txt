    "the effective masses of the vector mesons ( @xmath0,@xmath1 and @xmath2 ) in the hot and dense matter have attracted a lot of interest in the recent past , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "brown and rho came with the hypothesis that the vector meson masses drop in the medium according to a simple ( br ) scaling law @xcite , given as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the pion decay constant and asterix refers to in - medium quantities .",
    "there have been approaches based on qcd sum rules @xcite which confirm such a scaling hypothesis @xcite with a saturation scheme that leads to a delta function at the vector meson pole and a continuum for higher energies for the hadronic spectral function .",
    "it is however seen that such a simple saturation scheme for finite densities does not work and a more realistic description for the hadronic spectral function is called for @xcite . using an effective lagrangian model to calculate the hadronic spectral function ,",
    "it is seen that such a universal scaling law is not suggested for in - medium vector meson masses @xcite .    in the conventional hadronic models",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , the masses of the vector mesons stay constant or increase slightly , in the mean field approximation , i.e. , when the polarization from the dirac sea is neglected @xcite . with the inclusion of quantum corrections from the baryonic sector ,",
    "however , one observes a drop in the vector meson masses in the medium in the walecka model @xcite .",
    "this medium modification of the vector meson masses plays an important role in the enhanced dilepton yield @xcite for masses below the @xmath1 resonance in the heavy ion collision experiments @xcite .",
    "it has been emphasized recently that the dirac sea contribution ( taken into account through summing over baryonic tadpole diagrams in the relativistic hartree approximation ( rha ) ) dominates over the fermi sea contribution and @xmath5 is caused by a large dressing of @xmath6 cloud in the medium @xcite .",
    "it was earlier demonstrated in a nonperturbative formalism that a realignment of the ground state with baryon - antibaryon condensates was equivalent to the relativistic hartree approximation @xcite .",
    "the ground state for the nuclear matter was extended to include sigma condensates to take into account the quantum correction effects from the scalar meson sector .",
    "such a formalism includes multiloop effects and is self consistent .",
    "the methodology was then generalized to consider hot nuclear matter @xcite as well as to the situation of hyperon - rich dense matter @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we study the effect of such quantum corrections on the in - medium vector meson masses .",
    "we organize the paper as follows .",
    "we first briefly recapitulate the nonperturbative framework used for studying the quantum correction effects in hot nuclear matter in section ii .",
    "the medium modification of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson masses are considered in section iii .",
    "we also examine the effect of quantum corrections on the in - medium vector meson masses in dense hyperon - rich matter in section iv , where it is observed that the medium modification to the strange vector meson ( @xmath2 ) is small compared to that of the vector @xmath0 meson .",
    "this is because , in the hyperonic matter with quantum effects taken into account @xcite , the masses of the hyperons remain rather insensitive to density , unlike the in - medium nucleon masses which change appreciably with density , and further , because the @xmath2-mesons do not couple to the nucleons @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath0 meson mass gets contribution also from the nucleonic sector . in section",
    "v , we summarize the results of the present work and discuss possible outlook .",
    "we briefly recapitulate here the vacuum polarisation effects arising from the nucleon and scalar meson fields in hot nuclear matter in a nonperturbative framework @xcite .",
    "the method of thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) is used here to study the  ground state \" ( the state with minimum thermodynamic potential ) at finite temperature and density within the walecka model .",
    "the temperature and density dependent baryon and sigma masses are also calculated in a self - consistent manner in the formalism .",
    "the ansatz functions involved in such an approach are determined through minimisation of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "the lagrangian density in the walecka model is given as @xmath7 in the above , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the fields for the nucleon , @xmath9 , and @xmath0 mesons with masses m , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 respectively . the quartic coupling term in @xmath9 is necessary for the sigma condensates to exist , through a vacuum realignment @xcite .",
    "we retain the quantum nature of both the nucleon and the scalar meson fields , whereas , the vector @xmath0 meson is treated as a classical field , using the mean field approximation for @xmath0meson , given as @xmath13 .",
    "the reason is that without any quartic or any other higher order term for the @xmath0-meson , the quantum effects generated due to @xmath0-meson through the present variational ansatz turns out to be zero .    the hamiltonian density can then be written as @xmath14 with    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17    we may now write down the field expansion for the nucleon field @xmath8 at time @xmath18 as @xcite @xmath19 e^{i\\bfm k\\cdot \\bfm x } d\\bfm k,\\ ] ] with @xmath20 and @xmath21 as the baryon annihilation and antibaryon creation operators with spins @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the spinors associated with the particles and antiparticles respectively @xcite",
    "similarly , we may expand the field operator of the scalar field @xmath9 in terms of the creation and annihilation operators , at time @xmath18 as @xmath26 in the above , @xmath27 .",
    "the perturbative vacuum is defined corresponding to this basis through @xmath28 .    to include the vacuum polarisation effects for hot nuclear matter",
    ", we shall now consider a trial state with baryon  antibaryon and scalar meson condensates and then generalize the same to the finite temperatures and densities @xcite .",
    "we thus explicitly take the ansatz for the trial state as @xmath29 with @xmath30\\ ] ] here @xmath31 and @xmath32 is a trial function associated with baryon - antibaryon condensates .",

    "@xmath41 corresponds to a classical field of the conventional approach @xcite .",
    "clearly , the ansatz state is not annihilated by the operators , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "hence @xmath2-mesons do not have any mass modification in nuclear matter , but get modified in strange hadronic matter .",
    "the hyperon - rich dense matter has been studied earlier in a nonperturbative treatment @xcite including the vacuum polarizations from the baryons ( nucleons and hyperons ) and scalar meson sector .",
    "this has been done in the context of structure of neutron stars and so the condition of electrical charge neutrality has been imposed for the study of the strange hadronic matter . in the present section ,",

    "we first discuss the effect of quantum corrections on the in - medium nucleonic properties for the hot nuclear matter @xcite . in fig . 1",
    ", we plot the temperature dependence of the nucleon mass for various values of the baryon density .",
    "the quantum corrections arising from the sigma field has the effect of the softening of the equation of state , and , a higher value for the effective nucleon mass as compared to the rha .",
    "the effective nucleon mass was seen to increase with the vacuum polarisation effects arising from the baryons as compared to the mft calculations @xcite .",
    "though for @xmath153 , the effective nucleon mass decreases monotonically with temperature , for higher values of densities , the nucleon mass first increases and then decreases as a function of temperature @xcite .",
    "the variation in the nucleon mass is very slow upto a temperature , t@xmath154 150 mev , beyond which there is a fast decrease .",
    "though qualitative features are same for the in - medium mass with inclusion of quantum effects from the scalar meson sector , it is observed that such effects lead to a higher value for the nucleon mass .",
    "we next study the temperature and density dependence of the vector mesons in the hot nuclear matter . in figure 2",
    ", we plot the @xmath0 meson mass as a function of the temperature for various densities , with the @xmath155 coupling along with the scalar coupling @xmath156 , determined from the nuclear matter saturation properties .",
    "in particular , for rha , @xmath157 , and with quantum corrections from scalar mesons for self coupling , @xmath85=1.8 , @xmath158 , respectively @xcite . in walecka model , the dirac sea has been shown to have a significant contribution over the fermi sea , leading to a substantial drop in the omega meson mass in the nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "specifically , at saturation density at @xmath159 , the decrease in the omega meson mass from the vacuum value , is around 150 mev in rha , whereas with sigma quantum effects , the drop in the mass reduces to around 117 mev .",
    "a similar reduction in the mass drop , as compared to the rha was also observed when scalar field quantum corrections were included within an one loop approximation @xcite , unlike the approximation adopted here , which is self - consistent and includes multi - loop effects .",
    "this means that the quantum corrections do play an important role in the medium modification of the vector meson masses . in the present work",
    ", it is seen that the quantum corrections from the scalar mesons , over those arising from the baryonic sector , have the effect of giving rise to a higher value for the @xmath0-meson mass .",
    "this again is related to the fact that effective nucleon mass is higher when such quantum effects are taken into account . in figure 3",
    ", we illustrate the medium modification for the @xmath1 meson mass with the vector and tensor couplings to the nucleons being fixed from the nn forward dispersion relation @xcite .",
    "the values for these couplings are given as @xmath160=0.55 and @xmath161=6.1 .",
    "we notice that the decrease in the @xmath1 meson with increase in temperature is much sharper than that of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "such a behaviour of @xmath1-meson undergoing a much larger medium modification was also observed earlier @xcite , with the relativistic hartree approximation for the nucleons .",
    "this indicates that the tensor coupling plays a significant role for the @xmath1 meson , which is absent for the @xmath0 meson . with inclusion of quantum corrections from the scalar meson",
    ", the qualitative comparison between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 vector mesons remains the same , though these effects are seen to lead to larger values for the vector meson masses .    in the vector and tensor couplings of the @xmath1 meson to the nucleons as determined from the nn forward scattering processes @xcite as considered above , any medium dependence of these couplings",
    "have not been taken into account .",
    "we shall next consider the mass modification for the @xmath1 meson , with the nucleon @xmath1 coupling , @xmath162 as determined from the symmetry energy coefficient , @xmath163 , given as @xcite @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the fermi momentum of nuclear matter at saturation density , @xmath166 . in our calculations , we choose @xmath167 mev , which gives the value for the nucleon - rho meson coupling as @xmath162 = 6.82 , 7.0 , for rha and @xmath85 = 1.8 , respectively .",
    "however , in considering such a medium dependence of the vector coupling , it is assumed that the temperature dependence of such coupling is much smaller compared to its density dependence , and hence has not been taken into account in the present work .",
    "we take the tensor coupling as a parameter in our calculations . since the medium dependence of the tensor coupling is not known as yet .",
    "the in - medium mass of the @xmath1 meson is plotted in figure 4 for baryon density @xmath168=0.5 .",
    "it is observed that the @xmath1 meson mass has a strong dependence on the tensor coupling . for the same tensor coupling @xmath154 6 ,",
    "the @xmath1 meson mass is much lower ( @xmath169 0.33 ) when the medium dependence of the vector coupling constant is taken into account through the symmetry energy , as compared to the value ( @xmath170 ) , when @xmath171 is fixed from the n - n forward scattering processes .    in figure 5 ,",
    "the effective baryon masses , @xmath172 , in the hyperon matter are plotted as a function of the baryon density at zero temperature , for rha , and , with quantum corrections also from scalar mesons .",
    "the variation of the hyperon masses are slower as compared to the nucleon masses .",
    "this is a reflection of a smaller coupling of hyeprons to the scalar sigma field @xcite .",
    "further , we note that the decrease in the effective baryon mass with density , is slower when quantum corrections from the sigma mesons through condensates are taken into account as was the case for nuclear matter @xcite .    the medium modification for the vector mesons ( @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) in the hyperonic matter are plotted in figure 6 .",
    "one observes that the strange meson @xmath2 has smaller modification to the mass as compared to that of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath2-meson does not couple to the nucleons and also , the hyperon masses are rather insensitive to the changes in the baryon densities as may be seen in figure 5 .",
    "the strange meson ( @xmath2 ) mass modification observed as small compared to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson masses is in line with the earlier observations @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have considered in the present paper , the vector meson mass modifications due to quantum correction effects in the hot and dense matter .",
    "the baryonic properties as modified due to such effects subsequently determine the vector meson masses in the hot and dense hadronic matter .",
    "it has been recently emphasized that the dirac sea contribution dominates over the fermi sea , thus implying that the vacuum polarisation effects arising from the baryonic sector do play an important role in the vector meson properties in a medium . in the present work ,",
    "we study the effect of quantum corrections arising from the scalar meson over those resulting from the baryon sector ( given through the summing over baryonic tadpole diagrams in the relativistic hartree approximation ) .",
    "the quantum corrections from @xmath9-meson give rise to a higher value for the vector meson masses .",
    "also , it is observed that the strange vector meson ( @xmath2 ) has smaller medium modification in the hyperon matter as compared to the @xmath0-meson similar to earlier observations .",
    "this is a reflection of the facts that , firstly , the hyperon masses have much smaller modification as compared to that of nucleons and , also , secondly , the @xmath2-meson does not couple to the nucleons , whereas @xmath0-meson does have appreciable contribution from the coupling to the nucleons .",
    "the vector meson properties being modified in a medium have an important role to play in the dilepton production in relativistic heavy ion collisions and it will be interesting to investigate how the dilepton yield gets affected due to the quantum corrections in the hot and dense matter .",

    "<S> the medium modification of vector meson masses is studied taking into account the quantum correction effects for the hot and dense hadronic matter . in the framework of quantum hadrodynamics , the quantum corrections from the baryon and scalar meson sectors </S>",
    "<S> were earlier computed using a nonperturbative variational approach through a realignment of the ground state with baryon - antibaryon and sigma meson condensates . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of such corrections was seen to lead to a softer equation of state giving rise to a lower value for the compressibility and , an increase in the in - medium baryonic masses than would be reached when such quantum effects are not taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> these quantum corrections arising from the scalar meson sector result in an increase in the masses of the vector mesons in the hot and dense matter , as compared to the situation when only the vacuum polarisation effects from the baryonic sector are taken into account .    </S>",
