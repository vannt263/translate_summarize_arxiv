    "one of the most important legacies of the _ cobe _ satellite for the inflationary cosmology was its emphasis that observations had reached a quality where the inflationary prediction for the density perturbations could no longer be taken to be the scale - invariant harrison ",
    "zeldovich spectrum .",
    "that paradigm was quickly replaced by a new one , where the spectrum is approximated by a power - law in wavenumber , with spectral index @xmath0 giving the scale dependence .",
    "different inflation models predict different values for this spectral index , and the high accuracy with which @xmath0 can potentially be observed ( bond , efstathiou & tegmark 1997 ; zaldarriaga , spergel & seljak 1997 ) promises very strong discrimination between different inflation models @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of whether future observations , in particular high - accuracy microwave background anisotropy measurements by satellites such as _ map _ and _ planck _ , might be of such stunning accuracy that even the power - law approximation may prove inadequate .",
    "this has long been known to be the case for ` designer ' models of inflation @xcite , where one tunes sharp features into the power spectrum by careful placement of strong features in the potential of the inflation field , at just the point where perturbations on cosmologically observable scales are being created .",
    "such models have long been regarded as rather unnatural , but retain interest as they are eminently testable by combinations of microwave background and large - scale structure observations .    a more pertinent question concerns whether the breaking of the power - law might be detectable in the types of models regarded as theoretically most appealing .",
    "such models are of the slow - roll type ( see liddle & lyth 1993 for a review ) .",
    "several papers had pointed out that the spectral index would not be constant in typical models ( barrow & liddle 1993 ; copeland et al .",
    "1993 , 1994a ) , and an analysis of a range of slow - roll models was given by kosowsky & turner who wrote down a general formula for the scale dependence using the slow - roll expansion . since their paper , however , theoretical prejudice has moved towards a subset of slow - roll inflation models , the so - called hybrid inflation models @xcite .",
    "these models have the disappointing feature observationally that any gravitational wave contribution to the microwave anisotropies is expected to be negligible @xcite , but at least in some cases this appears to be compensated by a possible detectability of the scale dependence of the spectral index .",
    "an important question is the influence of the possible scale dependence on estimates of all other cosmological parameters , through the extra degeneracies introduced .",
    "we shall show that the cosmological parameters are only mildly affected .",
    "one of the crucial roles of microwave anisotropy experiments is to estimate cosmological parameters .",
    "these can be divided into two types .",
    "the cosmological parameters , such as the hubble parameter , the density parameter and parameters describing the dark matter , give the evolution of the background space - time .",
    "the second set of parameters describe the density perturbations which lead to the anisotropies .",
    "the simplest assumption , which coincides with the prediction of most inflation models and which we shall adopt throughout , is that the perturbations are adiabatic and gaussian - distributed , in which case they are completely specified by the form of the density perturbation spectrum .",
    "it goes without saying that the more parameters we believe are needed to describe a data - set , the worse determined they will be , so the input power spectrum plays a crucial role in the parameter estimation .",
    "assuming at least that the power spectrum is suitably slowly varying , the best way to proceed ( see e.g.  lidsey et al .",
    "1997 ) is to expand its logarithm as a taylor series in @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the comoving wavenumber ) about some wavenumber @xmath4 , and truncate after some number of terms , i.e. @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the spectrum of the curvature perturbation , defined as in liddle & lyth , which is scale - independent for a harrison",
    " zeldovich spectrum , which corresponds to @xmath7 .",
    "obviously @xmath4 is best chosen near the center of the range probed by the observations in question , but we will be more precise about this below .    the harrison ",
    "zeldovich spectrum amounts to truncating this expansion after one term , and the power - law approximation to truncating it after the second term .",
    "we shall investigate the possible inclusion of the third and fourth terms .    whether or not the power - law approximation is accurate",
    "clearly depends on the range of scales probed , measured by the size @xmath8 reaches for a given data set . for _ planck _ , which probes a range of multipoles from @xmath9 to about @xmath10",
    ", this term reaches about @xmath11 on either side of the central value .",
    "it is known that _",
    "planck _ can measure the spectral index @xmath0 of a perfect power - law spectrum to an accuracy of better than @xmath12 ; however this does not directly lead to an estimate of the uncertainty in @xmath13 since this uncertainty also depends on the sensitivity of the given experiment to the power spectrum as a function of scale .",
    "instead , we determine the errors on the first two derivatives of @xmath0 by including them in the set of parameters to be determined from the data and using the fisher matrix , as we now describe .    in principle , a brute - force maximum likelihood approach would give the best estimates of a set of cosmological parameters from a cmb anisotropy data set , in the sense that the expected variances of the estimates are minimized .",
    "in practice , such an approach would not be feasible for the quantity of data expected from the next generation of experiments ( for example , satellite experiments will produce cmb maps with at least @xmath14 pixels ) .",
    "however , recent work on data analysis techniques suggests that near - optimal estimates of parameters could be achieved using computationally feasible algorithms @xcite . in any case",
    ", it is useful to consider what the smallest possible error bars on the parameter estimates will be and these can be calculated in a straightforward way using the fisher information matrix , @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the covariance matrix for the parameter estimates is then the inverse of this matrix , and in particular the standard error for the estimate of parameter @xmath16 is @xmath17 .",
    "this approach was used by jungman et al . to determine the accuracy with which cosmological parameters could be determined from observations of temperature anisotropies , making use of a semi - analytical method to calculate the required angular power spectra and allowing for a variation in the spectral index with scale .",
    "bond et al .",
    "repeated their analysis , calculating the angular power spectra with a numerical boltzmann code for greater accuracy , but did not consider deviations from a power - law perturbation spectrum .",
    "the improvement in parameter estimates when polarization information is included was investigated by zaldarriaga et al .  .",

    "we calculate parameter uncertainties for two different specifications for the _ planck _ satellite  one for four channels of the high frequency instrument ( hfi ) with no polarization capability ( using the experimental parameters of bond et al .  1997 ) and one for the 140 ghz channel of the hfi with polarizers ( using the parameters of zaldarriaga et al .",
    "1997 ) . in both cases",
    "we take the usable sky area as @xmath77 .",
    "in addition to the specifications of the experiment being considered , the estimated parameter errors also depend on the underlying cosmological model from which the data is drawn and on the choice of parameters to be determined from the data . for the latter",
    "we adopt a subset of the variables used by bond et al . along with the derivatives of the scalar spectral index mentioned above .",

    "the normalization of the power spectrum is given in terms of the band - power corresponding to the filter for the given experiment , @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider the inflationary parameters : @xmath84 which is the ratio of the tensor to scalar quadrupole moments , and the scalar spectral index @xmath0 and its derivatives . they are discussed more fully in the next section . for the underlying cosmology",
    "we take a standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model , with the following parameters ; @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath7 , @xmath91 .    the calculation of the fisher matrix eq .",
    "( [ fisher ] ) requires the derivatives of the angular power spectra with respect to each parameter , @xmath92 .",
    "we determine these derivatives with finite differences , with the power spectra calculated using the cmbfast code @xcite .",
    "for some parameters these derivatives vary significantly within @xmath93 of the target value , indicating that for these directions of parameter space the likelihood function is not well fit by a gaussian . in these cases",
    "we use an iterative method such that the step size for each parameter used to calculate the derivative is approximately equal to its estimated @xmath93 error . we have found that the resulting gaussian approximation gives a good fit to the true likelihood function , in particular correctly reproducing the strong correlations between some parameters .",
    "however , this dependence of the results on the details of the algorithm demonstrates that the given parameter errors should be taken as a guide only .",
    "other uncertainties in the fisher matrix approach are considered by magueijo & hobson .",
    "there is also freedom in the choice of the scale about which to expand the power spectrum , @xmath4 of eq .",
    "( [ psexp ] ) .",
    "the estimated errors on @xmath0 and its derivatives are particularly sensitive to the choice of this scale , with values varying by an order of magnitude for different choices within the observed range of scales .",
    "however , an appropriate choice of @xmath4 can minimize these error estimates .",
    "in fact , when the true power spectrum is such that only @xmath0 and @xmath13 are non - vanishing it can be shown that @xmath4 can be chosen so that the error on @xmath0 is unchanged from the case of a power - law spectrum , and is uncorrelated with @xmath13 .",
    "this is because a scale exists at which the introduction of @xmath94 does not contribute to the mean value of @xmath0 , the mean being weighted by the error estimation procedure .",
    "for the non - polarized configuration this optimal choice is @xmath95 mpc@xmath96 , while for the polarized configuration it is @xmath97 mpc@xmath96 .",
    "although in principle there is no guarantee that this is still the case when higher derivatives are present in the power spectrum , in practice we find that the above choices for @xmath4 give approximately the same errors on @xmath0 and @xmath13 when @xmath98 is included .",
    "we therefore give error estimates evaluated at these scales , bearing in mind that the errors at other scales can be much larger .",
    "the resulting parameter errors are displayed in table  [ errors_tab ] , for the two different experimental configurations and for increasingly general forms of the inflationary perturbation spectrum . for a power - law spectrum our estimates are in good agreement with those of other workers , and do not change substantially when the power - law assumption is relaxed , except that as noted above the errors on @xmath0 and its derivatives increase dramatically at scales away from @xmath4 .",
    "it should be remembered that these values are not exact one - sigma errors , given the uncertainties of the fisher matrix formalism mentioned previously .",
    "the results for the spectra from slow - roll inflation are by now extremely well known .",
    "we follow the definitions of liddle & lyth .",
    "the spectrum @xmath99 of the curvature perturbation @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 here @xmath102 is the potential of the scalar field driving inflation , and @xmath103 is one of three slow - roll parameters defined by @xmath104 where a prime indicates derivative with respect to the scalar field @xmath105 .",
    "note that @xmath103 is positive by definition . despite the square",
    ", @xmath106 can be either positive or negative ; the square is to indicate that it is second - order in the slow - roll expansion , which is an expansion in @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "these parameters must be less than one for the slow - roll approximation to be valid .    at a given point on the potential , corresponding to the location where the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ psexp ] ) is carried out , the slow - roll parameters are in general independent since the derivatives can be freely chosen .",
    "there are further ones corresponding to higher derivatives but we do nt need them in this paper .",
    "the equations of motion for inflation give the slow - roll result @xmath108 which allows us to compute the spectral index and its derivative with respect to the potential .",
    "the formulae are remarkably simple ; the spectral index is @xcite @xmath109 and its derivative is @xcite @xmath110    along with these , another crucial inflationary observable is the influence of gravitational waves , relative to density perturbations , on large - angle microwave background anisotropies , given by @xcite @xmath111    combining these equations gives @xmath112 which was first given by kosowsky & turner .",
    "remember that in general @xmath106 is independent of the other two parameters , and that it can be positive or negative . in fig .  1 we show the expected scale dependence under the assumption that @xmath113 ;",
    "since in general it is unconnected to the first two this should be a good guide though obviously it is possible for some degree of cancellation to occur .",
    "for example , in the power - law inflation model the @xmath106 term precisely cancels the scale dependence , though this is a very special situation .",
    "= 6.3 cm +    as we confirmed in section [ s : ian ] , gravitational waves are only detectable ( at 95% confidence level ) if @xmath114 even if cosmic microwave background polarization is measured @xcite .",
    "the most optimistic scenario for measuring the scale dependence is if we can assume that all higher derivatives are negligible , and then with polarization a 95% confidence detection is possible if @xmath115 . studying the first term of eq .",
    "( [ scaldep ] ) , we immediately see that for it to be important then the tensors have to be detectable , by some margin .",
    "much more interesting is the second term , because provided @xmath0 is not too close to unity , it can give a detectable contribution to the scale dependence even if @xmath116 is not itself detectable ( though @xmath84 can not be very small ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  1 ; there exist regions where @xmath117 but where @xmath118 .",
    "in fact , hybrid inflation models often have undetectable @xmath84 but @xmath0 significantly different from unity . the final @xmath106 term in eq .",
    "( [ scaldep ] ) is in general independent of the others and so nothing can be said directly , other than that _ a priori _ it is as likely to reinforce the scale dependence as partially cancel it .    in conclusion , then , there exist significant parameter regions , including ones currently observationally viable , where the scale dependence of the spectral index can be measured . in such cases , it provides extra information concerning the inflation model which would not otherwise be available . in some cases ,",
    "the scale dependence is measurable even when the tensor contribution is not .",
    "we end with a brief description of a particular type of inflation model where @xmath13 is detectable .",
    "stewart has recently presented two interesting models , the idea being to use quantum corrections to flatten the potential of the inflaton sufficiently to allow it to support an inflationary epoch .",
    "the argument is not difficult to reproduce .",
    "typical inflation models require a non - zero scalar potential energy @xmath119 . in supergravity",

    "stewart pointed out that if @xmath105 has either gauge or yukawa couplings , to vector or chiral superfields with soft supersymmetry breaking masses squared of order @xmath124 , then quantum corrections will renormalize the mass of @xmath105 leading to a one - loop renormalization group effective potential of the form @xmath125 \\label{effpot}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 is the one  loop suppression factor , @xmath127 , with the expression being valid for @xmath128 .",
