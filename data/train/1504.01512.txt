    "<S> * spin - orbit effects @xcite have the potential of radically changing the field of spintronics by allowing transfer of spin angular momentum to a whole new class of materials . in a seminal letter to nature @xcite , kajiwara _ et al . _ showed that by depositing platinum ( pt , a normal metal ) on top of a 1.3  @xmath0 m thick yttrium iron garnet ( yig , a magnetic insulator ) , one could effectively transfer spin angular momentum through the interface between these two different materials . </S>",
    "<S> the outstanding feature was the detection of auto - oscillation of the yig when enough dc current was passed in the pt . </S>",
    "<S> this finding has created a great excitement in the community for two reasons : first , one could control electronically the damping of insulators , which can offer improved properties compared to metals , and here yig has the lowest damping known in nature ; second , the damping compensation could be achieved on very large objects , a particularly relevant point for the field of magnonics @xcite whose aim is to use spin - waves as carriers of information . </S>",
    "<S> however , the degree of coherence of the observed auto - oscillations has not been addressed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we emphasize the key role of quasi - degenerate spin - wave modes , which increase the threshold current . </S>",
    "<S> this requires to reduce both the thickness and lateral size in order to reach full damping compensation @xcite , and we show clear evidence of coherent spin - orbit torque induced auto - oscillation in micron - sized yig discs of thickness 20  nm . *    when spin transfer effects were first introduced by slonczweski and berger in 1996 @xcite , the authors immediately recognized that the striking signature of the transfer process would be the emission of microwave radiation when the system is pumped out of equilibrium by a dc current . since the spin transfer torque on the magnetisation is collinear to the damping torque , there is an instability threshold when the natural damping is fully compensated by the external flow of angular momentum , leading to spin - wave amplification through stimulated emission . using analogy to light , </S>",
    "<S> the effect was called swaser @xcite , where sw stands for spin - wave . until 2010 , </S>",
    "<S> all swaser devices required a charge current perpendicular to the plane to transfer angular momentum between different magnetic layers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this implied that the effect was restricted to conducting materials . </S>",
    "<S> the situation has radically changed since spin - orbit effects such as the spin hall effect ( she ) @xcite are used to produce spin currents in normal metals . here </S>",
    "<S> a right hand side rule links the deflected direction of the electron and the orientation of its spin . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the creation of a pure spin current transversely to the charge current , with an efficiency given by the spin hall angle @xmath1 . using a metal with large @xmath1 , such as pt , </S>",
    "<S> a charge current flowing in plane generates a pure spin current flowing perpendicular to the plane , which can eventually be transferred through an interface with ferromagnetic metals , resulting in the coherent emission of spin - waves @xcite , but also with non - metals such as yig @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic mechanisms of transfer of angular momentum between a normal metal and a ferromagnetic layer are quite different depending on the latter being metallic or not . in the first case , </S>",
    "<S> electrons in each layer have the possibility to penetrate the other one , whereas in the second case the transfer takes place exactly and solely at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus much more sensitive to the imperfection of the interface . </S>",
    "<S> still , a direct experimental evidence that spin current can indeed cross such an hybrid interface is through the so - called spin pumping effect @xcite : adding a normal metal on top of yig increases its ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) linewidth @xcite , which is due to the new relaxation channel at the interface through which angular momentum can escape and get absorbed in the metal . </S>",
    "<S> this effect being interfacial , the broadening scales as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the thickness of yig . even for yig , </S>",
    "<S> whose natural linewidth is only a few oersted at 10  ghz , it is hardly observable if @xmath3 exceeds a couple hundreds of nanometers . for these thick films </S>",
    "<S> though , the spin pumping can still be detected through inverse spin hall effect ( ishe ) . in a normal metal with strong spin - orbit interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the pumped spin current is converted into a transverse charge current . </S>",
    "<S> this generates a voltage proportional to the length of the sample across the metal , which can easily reach several tens of microvolts in millimeter - sized samples . since the first experiment by kajiwara _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , many studies reported the ishe detection of fmr using different metals on yig layers @xcite , hereby providing clear evidence of at least partial transparency of the hybrid yig@xmath4metal interfaces to spin currents . </S>",
    "<S> due to onsager relations , these results made the community confident that a spin current could thus be injected from metals to yig and lead to the swaser effect .    from the beginning </S>",
    "<S> it was anticipated that the key to observe auto - oscillations in non - metals was to reduce the threshold current . </S>",
    "<S> the first venue is of course to choose a material whose natural damping is very low . in this respect yig is the optimal choice . </S>",
    "<S> the second thing is to reduce the thickness since the spin - orbit torque ( sot ) is an interfacial effect . </S>",
    "<S> this triggered an effort in the fabrication of ultra - thin films of yig of very high dynamical quality @xcite . for 20  </S>",
    "<S> nm thick yig films with damping constant as low as @xmath5 , a striking result was that there were no evidence of auto - oscillations in millimeter - sized samples at the highest dc current possible in the top pt layer @xcite , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , before it evaporates . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning at this point that reducing further the thickness or the damping parameter of such ultra - thin yig films @xcite does not help anymore in decreasing the threshold current , as the relevant value of the damping is that of the yig@xmath4pt hybrid , which ends up to be completely dominated by the spin - pumping contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> but most notably , none of these high - quality ultra - thin yig films display a purely homogeneous fmr line . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for that is well known . in such extended films , </S>",
    "<S> there are many degenerate modes with the main , uniform fmr mode , which through the process of two - magnon scattering broaden the linewidth @xcite . a striking evidence of these degenerate modes can be obtained by parametrically pumping the sw modes . </S>",
    "<S> it reveals an uncountable number of modes which are at the same energy as the fmr mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> any threshold instability will be affected by the presence of those modes , as learnt from lasers where mode competition is known to have a strong influence on the emission threshold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the next natural step was to reduce as well the lateral size in order to lift the degeneracy between modes through confinement . </S>",
    "<S> the first microstructures of yig appeared revealing that the patterning indeed narrowed the linewidth through a decrease of the inhomogeneous part @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is clear in the perpendicular geometry , where magnon - magnon processes are suppressed owing to the fact that the fmr mode lies at the bottom of the sw dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not the case in the parallel geometry where the fmr mode is not the lowest energy sw mode . </S>",
    "<S> even then , we showed that the linewidth in a micron - sized yig@xmath4pt disc could be still tuned thanks to sot @xcite . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we describe the direct electrical detection of auto - oscillations in similar samples and show that the threshold current is increased by the presence of quasi - degenerate sw modes .    </S>",

    "<S> the 20  nm thick yig layer is grown by pulsed laser deposition @xcite and the 8  nm thick pt layer is sputtered on top of it @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their physical parameters are summarized in table i. we stress that the extended yig film is characterized by a low gilbert damping parameter @xmath10 and a remarkably small inhomogeneous contribution to the linewidth , @xmath11  oe . </S>",
    "<S> each microdisc is connected to electrodes enabling the injection of a dc current @xmath7 in the pt layer , and a microwave antenna is defined around it to obtain an inductive coupling with the yig magnetisation , as shown schematically in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : mat ]        first , we monitor with a spectrum analyser the voltage produced in the antenna by potential auto - oscillations of the 4 @xmath0 m yig disc as a function of the dc current @xmath7 injected in pt . the in - plane magnetic field @xmath12  koe is applied in a transverse direction with respect to @xmath7 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a . </S>",
    "<S> this is the most favorable configuration to compensate the damping and obtain auto - oscillations in yig , as spins accumulated at the yig@xmath4pt interface due to she in pt will be collinear to its magnetisation . </S>",
    "<S> color plots of the inductive signal measured as a function of the relative polarities of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b  e . at @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> , we observe in the power spectral density ( psd ) a peak which starts at around 2.95  ghz and @xmath14  ma and then shifts towards lower frequency as @xmath7 is increased ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) , a clear signature that spin transfer occurs through the yig@xmath4pt interface . </S>",
    "<S> the linewidth of the emission peak , lying in the 1020  mhz range for @xmath15  ma , also proves the coherent nature of the detected signal . </S>",
    "<S> an identical behaviour is observed at @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the psd remains flat in the two other cases ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c  </S>",

    "<S> therefore , an auto - oscillation signal is detected only if @xmath18 , in agreement with the expected symmetry of she .    in order to characterize the flow of angular momentum across the yig@xmath4pt interface </S>",
    "<S> , we now perform ishe - detected fmr spectroscopy on our microdiscs . </S>",
    "<S> the configuration of this experiment is similar to the previous case , but now the antenna generates a uniform microwave field @xmath19 to excite the fmr of yig while the dc voltage across pt is monitored at zero current ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , we perform the reciprocal experiment of the one presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . as described in the introduction , a voltage @xmath20 develops across pt when the fmr conditions are met in yig . </S>",
    "<S> this voltage changes sign as the field is reversed , which is expected from the symmetry of ishe , and shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b , where the fmr spectra of the 4  @xmath0 m and 2  @xmath0 m microdiscs are respectively detected at 1  ghz and 4  ghz . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that for a given field polarity , the product between @xmath20 and @xmath7 must be negative to compensate the damping @xcite , which enables to observe auto - oscillations in fig </S>",
    "<S> . 1 .    from these ishe measurements , the dispersion relation and frequency dependence of the full linewidth at half maximum of the main fmr mode can be determined , as shown in figs . 2c and 2d , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> 4b respectively present the inductive signal @xmath8 detected in the antenna coupled to these two discs as a function of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the configuration is the same as depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a , with a slightly larger bias field set to @xmath50  koe . </S>",
    "<S> one can clearly see a peak appearing in the psd close to 3.6  ghz in both cases , at a threshold current of about @xmath51  ma in the 4  @xmath0 m disc and @xmath52  ma in the 2  @xmath0 m disc . </S>",
    "<S> these two values correspond to a similar threshold current density in both samples of @xmath53 , in agreement with our previous study @xcite . as the dc current </S>",
    "<S> is varied towards more negative values , the peaks shift towards lower frequency ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4c ) , at a rate which is twice faster in the smaller disc . </S>",
    "<S> this frequency shift is mainly due to linear and quadratic contributions in @xmath7 of oersted field and joule heating , respectively @xcite ( from the pt resistance , the maximal temperature increase in both samples is estimated to be @xmath54c ) . at the same time , the signal first rapidly increases in amplitude , reaches a maximum , and then , more surprisingly , drops until it can not be detected anymore , as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4e , which plots the integrated power _ vs. _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of power measured in the 4  @xmath0 m disc ( 2.9  fw ) is four times larger than the one measured in the 2  @xmath0 m disc ( 0.7  fw ) , which is due to the inductive origin of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be estimated from geometrical considerations , @xmath55 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 is the magnetic constant , @xmath57 the diameter of the disc and @xmath58 the angle of uniform precession ( the prefactor @xmath59 accounts for microwave losses and impedance mismatch in the measured frequency range with our microwave circuit ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the same @xmath58 , the inductive voltage produced by the 4  @xmath0 m disc is thus twice larger than by one produced by the 2  @xmath0 m disc , hence the ratio four in power . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the maximal angle of precession reached by auto - oscillations is found to be about @xmath60 in both microdiscs @xcite . finally , the disappearance of the signal as @xmath7 gets more negative is accompanied by a continuous broadening of the linewidth , which increases from a few mhz to several tens of mhz ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this rather large auto - oscillation linewidth is also consistent with a small precession angle , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , a small stored energy in the yig oscillator @xcite .    by repeating the same analysis as a function of @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> , we can determine the bias field dependence of the auto - oscillations in both microdiscs . </S>",
    "<S> the onset frequency and threshold current at which auto - oscillations start are plotted in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4f and 4 g , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the onset frequency in the 4  @xmath0 m and 2  @xmath0 m microdiscs is identical and closely follows the dispersion relation of the main fmr mode plotted as a continuous line . </S>",
    "<S> the small redshift towards lower frequency , which increases with the applied field , is ascribed to the joule heating and oersted field induced by @xmath7 ( the kittel law in figs . 2c and 4f </S>",
    "<S> is obtained at @xmath61  ma ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the main fmr mode is the one which couples the most efficiently to our inductive electrical detection , because it is the most uniform . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we conclude that the detected auto - oscillations are due to the destabilisation of this mode by sot .    in order to reach auto - oscillations , </S>",
    "<S> the additional damping term due to sot has to compensate the natural relaxation rate @xmath62 in yig . </S>",
    "<S> given the transparency @xmath63 of the yig@xmath4pt interface and the spin hall angle @xmath1 in pt , this condition writes : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the section of the pt layer . the homogeneous contribution to @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> is given by the gilbert damping rate , which for the in - plane geometry is : @xmath66 we remind that this expression is obtained by converting the field linewidth to frequency linewidth through @xmath67 . if only the homogeneous contribution to the linewidth is taken into account , the threshold current @xmath68 is thus expected to depend linearly on @xmath6 , as shown by the dashed lines plotted in fig . </S>",

    "<S> in fact , it is the total linewidth that truly quantifies the losses of a magnetic device regardless of the nature and number of microscopic mechanisms involved . even in structures with micron - sized lateral dimensions , </S>",

    "<S> the presence of these sw modes is also known to play a crucial role in sot driven dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the strongly non - equilibrium distribution of sws promoted by sot in combination with nonlinear interactions between modes can lead to mode competition , which might even prevent auto - oscillations to start @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> 4e ) _ vs. _ @xmath7 are reminiscent of the presence of these quasi - degenerate sw modes . </S>",
    "<S> a meaningful interpretation of these experimental results is that as the fmr mode starts to auto - oscillate and to grow in amplitude as the dc current is increased above the threshold , its coupling to other sw modes  whose amplitudes also grow due to sot  becomes larger , which makes the flow of energy out of the fmr mode more efficient . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the inductive signal , as non - uniform sw modes are poorly coupled to our inductive detection scheme . at the same time , it enhances the auto - oscillation linewidth , which reflects this additional nonlinear relaxation channel .    the smaller inhomogeneous linewidth in the 2  @xmath0 m disc ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2d ) results in a field dependence of the threshold current closer to the one expected for the purely homogeneous case ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 g ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that reducing further the lateral size of the microstructure will allow to completly lift the quasi - degeneracy between spin - wave modes @xcite , as predicted by micromagnetic simulations , which show that this is obtained for lateral sizes smaller than @xmath74 m . </S>",
    "<S> this could extend the stability of the auto - oscillation for the fmr mode , and experimental techniques capable of detecting sws in nanostructures @xcite should be used to probe this transition . very importantly for the field of magnonics , it was recently shown that this constraint on confinement could be relaxed in one dimension such as to produce a propagation stripe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other strategies might consist in using specific non - uniform sw modes or to engineer the sw spectrum using topological singularities such as vortices , or bubbles , which could be most relevant to design active magnonics computational circuits . </S>"
