    "recently a methodology for calculating charge fluctuations in gated hybrid normal - superconducting systems has been formulated @xcite . in this letter",
    "we implement this methodology for one particularly relevant and enlightening example .",
    "we study the system depicted in fig . 1 , i.e. a gated n - s system in a high magnetic field , where the transport in the normal region is governed by edge states",
    ". we focus on calculating the charge fluctuations in the edge states in the region @xmath0 .",
    "this work coincides with recent experimental and theoretical research into the properties of hybrid normal - superconducting structures in high magnetic fields @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we first calculate the unscreened charge fluctuations for a general n - s structure ( sec .",
    "2 ) . then we proceed to incorporate screening into the problem ( sec .",
    "3 ) , enabling us to calculate the spectra of charge fluctuations in a gated n - s structure .",
    "we show that these spectra , at equilibrium , are determined by two quantities : the charge relaxation resistance , @xmath1 , and the electrochemical capacitance @xmath2 . in the presence of transport",
    ", we find that @xmath1 is replaced by @xmath3 , called here the schottky resistance , which reflects the shot noise of the structure",
    ". then we focus on one particular example ( sec .",
    "4 ) an n - s structure in a high magnetic field , see fig .",
    "1 . in particular we are interested in the charge fluctuations in the edge states in the region @xmath0 of fig .",
    "1 which can be measured by observing the current fluctuations at the gate @xmath4 . we consider a general case of a single edge state and an arbitary scatterer and more than one edge state in the case where the scatterer is a quantum point contact .",
    "consider a conductor where we have one normal lead and one superconducting lead , we can write an effective    @xmath5 scattering matrix for this system , @xmath6 where the @xmath7 are elements of the scattering matrix describing the process of an electron ( @xmath8 ) or hole ( @xmath9 ) entering from the normal lead and an electron ( @xmath10 ) or hole ( @xmath11 ) returning to the normal lead . making use of this @xmath12-matrix @xcite we can write down the local particle density of states elements at position @xmath13 as @xmath14 \\label{pdos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the electron / hole degrees of freedom ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 .",
    "the functional derivatives are taken at the equilibrium electrostatic potential @xmath21 . to give an example",
    ", @xmath22 is the hole density associated with an electron and a hole current amplitude incident from the normal lead and reflected back into the normal lead as an outgoing hole amplitude . with the help of this basic expression we can now find both the average density of states as well as the fluctuations .",
    "the total bare charge fluctuations in the conductor are given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 the hole density of states of a region @xmath0 of the conductor is @xmath25 where @xmath26 \\label{hdos}\\ ] ] and the electron density of states is @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "\\label{ppdos}\\ ] ] the trace is over open quantum channels , @xmath29 is the injectivity of electrons ( holes ) ( @xmath30 ) , from the normal lead into the conductor , given a change in the particle ( hole ) potential ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the fluctuations of the bare charge in a region @xmath0 of interest can be found from the charge operator @xmath32 given by @xmath33 \\label{nfluct}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the zero - frequency limit of @xmath34 is given by eq .",
    "( [ pdos ] ) . in eq .",
    "( [ nfluct ] ) , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) creates ( annihilates ) an incoming electron / hole ( @xmath37 ) in the normal lead .",
    "the true charge fluctuations must be obtained by taking into account the coulomb interaction and below we show how to obtain the true charge fluctuations from the fluctuations of the bare charges .",
    "consider an n - s system where we have a gate , coulomb coupled , to a region , @xmath0 , of the normal part of the system . then , assuming the gate has no dynamics of its own , the charge in the region coupled to the gate is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the operator for the internal potential of the conductor .",
    "also we can determine the charge @xmath40 as the sum of the bare charge fluctuations @xmath32 and the induced charges generated by the fluctuating induced electrical potential . in the random phase approximation",
    "the induced charges are proportional to the average frequency - dependent density of states @xmath41 times the fluctuating potential .",
    "hence , the net charge can be written as @xmath42 , this is the direct analogue of the result for a system with two normal leads @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath43 where @xmath44 and the total density of states is @xmath45.\\ ] ] we now wish to find the fluctuation spectra of the internal potential @xcite @xmath46 solving the above and making use of the fact that @xmath47 we find @xmath48 \\label{eq : fluct}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 + f_{\\beta}(e^\\prime)[1-f_{\\alpha}(e)].\\ ] ] in the above the sum is over all degrees of freedom @xmath51 , the fermi functions @xmath52 are defined such that @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the energy of a particle ( hole ) ( @xmath56 ) in the normal reservoir , which is at a chemical potential @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the fermi function at the condensate chemical potential of the superconducting lead ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "now we wish to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluct ] ) at equilibrium and zero temperature , to leading order in @xmath60 .",
    "we find @xmath61 with an equilibrium charge relaxation resistance @xmath62 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] also we find at zero temperature to leading order in @xmath63 that @xmath64 with a schottky resistance @xmath65 ^ 2}.\\ ] ]",
    "we now wish to consider the structure shown in figure 1 .",
    "if there is only one edge state then we can proceed to consider the situation when the gate only _ sees _ the edge state in the area @xmath0 . in this case a particle ( hole ) transversing the length _",
    "seen _ by the gate acquires a phase @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , this phase is determined by the potential in this region .",
    "this simplifies the s - matrix given by eq .",
    "( [ seff ] ) to @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the probability of normal reflection ( @xmath70 ) from the n - s structure , @xmath71 is the probability of andreev reflection ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 .",
    "we can then write , for the edge state described by the above scattering matrix , @xmath74 and that @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the particle ( hole ) ( @xmath77 ) density of states in the normal lead .",
    "after some algebra and assuming @xmath78 we can compare the charge relaxation resistance for the n - s structure ( @xmath79 ) and the same structure but with both leads being normal ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "we find @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "hence in equilibrium we find for the spectra of the charge fluctuations that @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the prescence of an applied voltage we find the schottky resistances @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the probability of normal reflection when we have replaced the superconducting lead with a normal lead .",
    "hence the non - equilibrium charge fluctuations are given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 the results above are for one edge state but the striking difference between the results for a n - s system",
    "as compared to a system where both leads are normal occurs when more than one edge state is present . to consider this scenario we shall focus on the particular example of our scattering region being a quantum point contact",
    "for such a system only one quantum channel opens at a time , i.e. for all other open channels the transmission through the quantum point contact is 1 , in the case of an ideal superconducting interface this implies that , for these open channels @xmath90 .",
    "hence , considering an additional edge state which has perfect transmission through the quantum point contact then this state generates no extra noise , and no extra contribution to screening , i.e. the total added charge is zero ( @xmath2 for this state is zero ) , thus eqs .",
    "( [ sqqw ] ) and ( [ sqqv ] ) remain valid , where @xmath70 and @xmath72 are the reflection probabilities for the opening quantum channel .",
    "this is in contrast to what happens to @xmath91 and @xmath92 where , again no noise is added , but an extra screening charge is @xcite for each edge state added , thus reducing the charge fluctuations seen in the gate , as more edge states are introduced .",
    "in this work we have shown how to calculate the screened charge fluctuations in a gated n - s structure , we then proceeded to focus on the example of how charge fluctuations in the edge states of an n - s system differ from those of a normal system .",
    "the most startling difference is that for the example of a quantum point contact scatterer the screened charge fluctuations are unaffected by the presence of extra edge states .",
    "this is in contrast to the normal case @xcite .",
    "this can be understood in the context of the electrochemical capacitance which for the n - s system is given by @xmath93 for perfect andreev reflection @xmath94 in contrast to the normal system where the electrochemical capacitance is given by @xmath95 which for finite @xmath96 and @xmath97 implies @xmath98 .",
    "comparing the two above equations we see that the introduction of andreev reflection reduces the electrochemical capacitance .",
    "it has been shown elsewhere that fluctuations in the charge in normal structures , as characterized by @xmath1 and @xmath3 , determines the dephasing rate @xcite .",
    "we expect that such a relationship is also true for normal superconducting hybrid structures .",
    "finally induced currents have been observed in gates which are coupled to normal conductors @xcite .",
    "here we see , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cmuns ] ) , that charging is reduced in the presence of andreev reflection and in the extreme case of perfect andreev reflection the charging is zero ."
