    "ice giant planets , such as uranus and neptune , have been known to exist for several hundred years . on july 10 , 2011 one complete neptunian orbit",
    "will have occurred since it was discovered on september 23 , 1846 from the calculations of le verrier and adams . over the past 15 years",
    ", the number of planets known outside of our solar system has grown to be more than 500 . yet our time baseline combined with the sensitivity of our measurements have not yet allowed us to probe into regions of parameter space where we might discover ice giants around solar analogs .",
    "microlensing surveys are producing insights into the frequency of giant planets beyond the `` snow line '' @xcite , but statistics regarding the orbital properties of ice giants remains unknown and formation scenarios are deprived of the kinds of data that now exist for jupiter analogs in exoplanetary systems .",
    "the internal structure of uranus and neptune are known to differ quite dramatically from that of jupiter and saturn @xcite .",
    "much work has been performed on the formation mechanisms for the giant planets , but contention still remains between the competing ideas of core accretion and disk instability scenarios ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the required timescales and current orbital configuration of the solar system giant planets favour a core accretion model , but the formation of uranus and neptune are still poorly understood @xcite . without other examples of ice giants to draw upon , it is difficult to understand where our ice giants formed , timescales for their migration , and their overall contributions to the orbital stability of the present solar system orbits .    as we approach the heliocentric birthday of neptune s discovery , it is appropriate to ask how close we are to discovering a twin to uranus or neptune elsewhere . with instrumentation improvements of radial velocity surveys and time baselines now stretching out beyond the orbit of jupiter , we are slowly entering a phase where the detection of uranus and neptune analogs is becoming more likely . here",
    "we provide detailed detection simulations of our giant planets from an external perspective , concentrating on the detectability of uranus and neptune .",
    "we describe the expected radial velocity and photometric signatures and provide scaling laws for application to detection thresholds for ice giants orbiting late - type stars which serve as far more feasible targets in the short - term .",
    "we compare these to imaging and astrometric experiments and assess the relative detection prospects .",
    "the formation of uranus and neptune in situ is problematic using core accretion models due to the lack of disk material .",
    "a proposed solution builds the ice giants in the same vicinity as jupiter whereupon they are scattered outwards once jupiter develops its gas envelope @xcite .",
    "subsequent interactions with the kuiper belt is likely to have both stabilized and circularized the orbits of uranus and neptune to their present orbital configuration @xcite .",
    "more detailed models of the formation mechanisms have since had success in explaining the relative chemical abundances now seen in uranus and neptune @xcite .",
    "even though theories regarding the formation of uranus and neptune are becoming more sophisticated , these still remain the only ice giants for which we have detailed orbital information from which such models may be constructed .",
    "a key factor is the location of the `` snow line '' , which is the radial distance from the center of a protostellar disk beyond which water molecules can efficiently condense to form ice . for our own system , this is approximately at the radius of the asteroid belt , @xmath0  au .",
    "the formation mechanisms required for the production of ice giants are therefore likely to be highly dependent upon the disk mass and the production of jupiter analogs which may either disrupt their formation or scatter them to a larger semi - major axis . in exoplanetary systems",
    ", we can expect to find ice giants in a range of orbital configurations , including high eccentricities , depending upon their formation circumstances .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]                figure [ phass ] shows the predicted phase signature for the solar system giant planets at optical wavelengths .",
    "the top panel includes all four planets . with each successive panel ,",
    "the planetary signatures are removed in order of increasing semi - major axis until only the signature of neptune remains .",
    "there are several key aspects to note here .",
    "firstly , the amplitude of these signatures , shown in the figure and also in table [ phatab ] , are below what is currently accessible . for comparison ,",
    "the ellipsoidal variations detected by @xcite for the planet hat - p-7b using kepler data was of amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "secondly , this does not take into account ring structures such as the prominent ring system of saturn @xcite , and so the phase signature is underestimated for some planets .",
    "thirdly , these signatures are significantly lower than the solar variability , which was compared to the photometric variability found amongst kepler stars by @xcite .",
    "the question of whether one could maintain precise photometric stability over long timescales is a related problem which is detector dependent .",
    "fourthly , this does not include contamination from the terrestrial planets .",
    "as shown in equation [ fluxratio ] , the inverse relation of the star ",
    "planet separation will generally dominate over differences in planetary radii .",
    "venus , for example , has an albedo of 0.65 which , combined with the much smaller semi - major axis , leads to a maximum flux ratio of @xmath2 or 43% for that of jupiter .",
    "thus , the possible presence of much smaller terrestrial planets can not be ignored .    by using the same examples as those described in section [ scaling ]",
    ", we can test how this seemingly dire situation were to change if neptune were to be found in different situations . if we place neptune at the snow line of a solar - type star ( @xmath3  days ) , then the predicted maximum flux ratio increases to @xmath4 , just slightly lower than that of venus . if however , neptune were to be located at the snow line of a late m dwarf ( @xmath5  days )",
    ", then the predicted maximum flux ratio becomes @xmath6 .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude below the flux ratio detected in hat - p-7 by @xcite .",
    "however , such flux ratios are not beyond the reach of planned coronographic missions and thirty - meter class telescopes and may provide an opportunity to not only detect an ice giant but to characterize the atmosphere .",
    "the limits on using astrometry for detecting outer planets have been explored by @xcite , and further investigated by combining with radial velocity data by @xcite .",
    "direct imaging of exoplanets has had recent success , such as the discovery of the planetary system orbiting the nearby star hr  8799 with semi - major axes as small as 14.5  au @xcite .",
    "the techniques of astrometry and imaging are distinct from the previous two methods investigated as they ( a ) are more sensitive to long - period orbits and ( b ) depend upon the distance to the system .",
    "they are further distinctive in that they are more sensitive to face - on orbits rather than edge - on orbits for which the radial velocity , transit , and ( often ) phase variation techniques typically favour .",
    "an addition factor for the imaging technique is the dependence upon the age of the system since young planets ( @xmath7  gyr ) will have self - luminous properties .",
    "the amplitude of the astrometric signature is given by @xmath8 according to the exoplanet data explorer , the distribution of distances to the host stars for the known radial velocity planets peaks at @xmath9  pcs , due largely to the observational biases in the target selection .",
    "neptune viewed from this distance has an angular separation from the sun of 0.86  arcsec but a predicted astrometric signature of 44  @xmath10arcsec .",
    "however , a neptune - mass planet located at the snow line of a late m dwarf has an angular separation of 0.007  arcsec and a predicted astrometric signature of 1.2  @xmath10arcsec .",
    "thus , if such techniques are to be used for attempting the detection of ice giants , actual solar analogues are preferred targets over late - type stars .",
    "current and future coronographic experiments may play a role in probing the regime of ice giants as sensitvities and angular resolutions increase .",
    "@xcite , for example , tabulates the inner working angle of selected future ground - based imaging instruments which lie in the range 0.030.17  arcsec , compared to 0.0350.850  arcsec for james webb space telescope ( jwst ) instruments .",
    "the formation and subsequent migration of ice giants appear to have played a major role in the overall formation and evolution of the outer solar system .",
    "whether this is generally true of other solar - type systems and the frequency of such ice giants remains to be seen .",
    "the current sample of exoplanets is probing deeper into this regime in terms of mass but needs a longer time baseline to establish the period sensitivity to detect true uranus / neptune analogues .",
    "as existing radial velocity surveys continue to monitor known exoplanet hosting stars and simultaneously improve instrument precisions , the growing sample will slowly push further into the regime of the ice giants .",
    "the regime is also being explored by the kepler and corot missions using the transit technique from space where it is the mission duration and not the observational window function that constrains the detection of long - period planets .",
    "detecting photometric phase variations poses significant technological challenges in the short - term and astrophysical challenges including intrinsic stellar variability and contamination from interior terrestrial planets .",
    "the current situation favours exploring neptune - mass planets beyond the snow line of late - type stars , where the required precision and timescales are significantly less , and will reveal the formation mechanisms in these environments .",
    "results from the kepler mission are allowing the study of transit timing variations which are sensitive enough to detect longer - period planets in those systems .",
    "in addition , continuing microlensing surveys have enough current sensitivity to provide a statistical census of ice giants through which we can determine the frequency of these objects , though not necessarily their orbital and physical characteristics .",
    "it has been demonstrated by @xcite that precision photometry of @xmath11% can be achieved with large telescopes through the use of narrow - band filters .",
    "simulations of current and planned coronagraphs by @xcite indicate that long - term stability may indeed be possible for exoplanet searches .",
    "future large ground - based telescopes , such as the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) , the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) , and the giant magellan telescope ( gmt ) , as well as space - based coronographic missions , may thus provide the needed precision for more direct detections via phase variation signatures and imaging .",
    "the author would like to thank kaspar von braun , jason wright , suvrath mahadevan , and chas beichman for several useful discussions .",
    "i would also like to thank the referees , whose comments helped to improve the quality of this work .",
