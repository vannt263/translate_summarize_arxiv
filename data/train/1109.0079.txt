    "over time , there has been much interest in the study and generation of exactly solvable potentials in quantum mechanics .",
    "one of the simplest techniques to carry out these purposes is the supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) , which is based on the intertwining relationship . in fact , this technique together with the factorization method and darboux transformation are equivalent procedures for generating solvable hamiltonians from a given initial one @xcite . in the simplest case of this approach",
    "both hamiltonians are related by a first - order differential operator .",
    "however , the fact that the zeros of the transformation function are mapped into singularities of the new potential imposes certain restrictions on this method .",
    "an alternative to avoid this difficulty is to employ the susy qm of higher order ( for more details and applications see @xcite ) .",
    "the most elementary version of such a generalization is the confluent second - order susy qm @xcite , for which the two involved factorization energies converge to the same value .",
    "however , the main problem for implementing this method has to do with the difficulty to calculate certain integrals which arise in the treatment .",
    "on the other hand , it has been shown @xcite that in the confluent case the wronskian formula is preserved if solutions closing a jordan chain of length two are used as seeds for implementing the algorithm . in this article",
    "we will take advantage of this fact by introducing a differential version of the technique which will preserve as well the general wronskian formula and will avoid to evaluate the previously mentioned integrals . in this way",
    ", an alternative calculational tool will be available for implementing the confluent second - order susy qm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we shall review the standard approach to the second - order susy qm for the confluent and non - confluent cases . a differential version of the wronskian formula for the confluent case will be presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    "this alternative method will be applied to the free particle and the single - gap lam potentials .",
    "a summary of our original results and some conclusions are contained in section 5 .",
    "in the second - order susy qm one typically starts from the following intertwining relationship @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 the aim is to determine @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 supposing that the initial potential @xmath5 is known .",
    "the solution to this problem is given by @xmath6 where @xmath3 must fulfil the non - linear differential equation @xmath7 and @xmath8 are two integration constants . in order to solve it",
    "is used the ansatz @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are functions to be determined . substituting in equation",
    ", it turns out that @xmath12 and the following ricatti equation must be satisfied @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the initial problem defined by equations ( [ 2s_entrelaza]-[2s_bmas ] ) has been reduced to find the function @xmath15 and , consequently , to solve equation ( [ 2s_ricatti ] ) .",
    "this riccati equation can be linearized by using @xmath16 , which leads to the following stationary schrdinger equation for @xmath17 : @xmath18 the kind of seed solution @xmath19 employed for constructing the transformation depends on the factorization energy @xmath20 and , consequently , on the sign of @xmath21 . for @xmath22 one",
    "gets the so called real and complex cases while for @xmath23 the confluent one is obtained .",
    "let us denote the two different factorization energies by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which includes both , the real and complex cases .",
    "note that the ansatz indeed gives place to two equations @xmath27 by subtracting both it is obtained @xmath28\\ } ' , \\label{solg}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the wronskian of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "substituting in one gets @xmath34\\}''.\\label{newv}\\ ] ] this expression has been used to construct a wide variety of potentials @xmath35 departing from a given initial one @xmath36 by choosing two appropriate solutions of .",
    "in fact , this treatment is so versatile that it can be implemented by taking as seeds even the gamow vectors , which gives place to complex potentials with known spectra ( see e.g. @xcite ) .      in the confluent case ( @xmath23 )",
    "both energies converge to just one , @xmath38 , and the ansatz of equation becomes @xmath39 this bernoulli equation has a general solution given by @xmath40\\}',\\ ] ] where @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 being real constants which can be chosen at will in order to avoid singularities in @xmath3 .    on the other hand , let us consider the following pair of generalized eigenfunctions of @xmath17 , of first and second rank , associated to @xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45 which is known as jordan chain of length two . by solving equation for @xmath46 through the method of variation of parameters , supposing that @xmath47 is given , we get @xmath48 moreover , by using the following wronskian identity @xmath49 which is valid for two differentiable arbitrary functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 , it is straightforward to show that @xmath50 therefore , the wronskian formula of the non - confluent second - order susy qm given by equation is preserved for the confluent case @xcite . moreover , it can be used to construct a one - parameter family of exactly solvable potentials for each solution @xmath47 of the initial stationary schrdinger equation associated to @xmath44 . however , if @xmath47 has an involved explicit form the task of evaluating the corresponding integrals is not simple . in the next section",
    "we shall present an alternative version of the wronskian formula for the confluent case which will make unnecessary the evaluation of the integrals of equations and .",
    "let us look for now the general solution of equation in a slightly different way .",
    "let @xmath47 denote once again the given solution of .",
    "it is well known that the general solution of the inhomogeneous second - order differential equation takes the form : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the general solution of the homogeneous equation and @xmath53 denotes a particular solution of the inhomogeneous one .",
    "since the homogeneous equation is of second order , it has two linearly independent solutions .",
    "they can be taken as @xmath47 and its orthogonal function @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 .",
    "the last equation can be immediately solved for @xmath54 , yielding @xmath56 then , it turns out that @xmath57 with @xmath58 .    in order to find the particular solution @xmath53 ,",
    "let us suppose from now on that @xmath47 and its parametric derivative with respect to @xmath44 , @xmath59 , are well defined continuous functions in a neighbourhood of @xmath44 .",
    "hence , by deriving equation with respect to @xmath44 it is obtained : @xmath60 where the partial derivatives of @xmath47 with respect to @xmath44 and @xmath61 have been interchanged .",
    "it should be clear now that ( compare equations and ) @xmath62 is the particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation we were looking for .",
    "finally , the general solution of equation is given by @xmath63 from this equation we can easily calculate the wronskian of the two solutions of the jordan chain as @xmath64 thus , the general wronskian formula of equation becomes now @xmath65\\right\\ } '' , \\label{dv}\\ ] ] which represents an alternative way to calculate the new potential @xmath33 through the confluent second - order susy transformation .",
    "note that a special case of equation has been addressed previously , for @xmath66 and the free particle potential @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the particular solution @xmath59 was taken directly as the seed solution @xmath46 and thus the constant @xmath67 , which arises from the non - trivial term involving the orthogonal function @xmath54 ( see the second term of the right hand side of equation ) , never appears in those treatments .",
    "an additional point is worth to remark : without the constant @xmath67 the confluent second - order susy partner potential @xmath35 will often have singularities .",
    "the freedom we have here for choosing this constant endows us with the possibility to generate families of non - singular potentials for a wide set of factorization energies .",
    "we are going to use equation now to implement a confluent second - order susy transformation for two simple systems .",
    "the first of them is the free particle , where both the differential and the integral versions of the confluent susy qm are easily applicable since the derivatives and the integrals involved are not difficult to calculate .",
    "the second one is the single - gap lam potential , for which the previously found integral equation is not easy to apply , since the integrals of elliptic functions are complicated to evaluate . as far as we know ,",
    "the confluent second - order susy transformation has been never applied before to this potential .",
    "the free particle is not subject to any force so that the corresponding potential is constant ; without loss of generality , let us take @xmath68 .",
    "in order to obtain non - singular confluent second - order susy partner potentials one has to use as transformation function , in general , a solution @xmath47 to the stationary schrdinger equation such that @xmath69 . this is achieved by demanding that @xmath47 vanishes at one of the boundaries of the @xmath61-domain ( see @xcite ) . in particular , for the free particle these solutions are @xmath70 with the condition that @xmath71 and @xmath44 satisfy the ` dispersion relation ' @xmath72 .",
    "we are going to use one of these solutions to perform the susy transformation , e.g. , @xmath73 ; the other case can be obtained through a spatial reflection .",
    "thus , the parametric derivative can be calculated using the chain rule as @xmath74 we can evaluate easily the wronskian of @xmath47 and @xmath59 by using once again equation : @xmath75 now , replacing into for calculating the confluent second - order susy partner potential @xmath33 of the free particle it is obtained : @xmath76 due to the ` dispersion relation ' ( @xmath77 ) there is a natural restriction on the factorization energy , namely , @xmath78 . besides , in order to obtain non - singular transformations the parameter @xmath67 has to be restricted @xcite . indeed , for @xmath73 we have that the non - singular domain is given by @xmath79 , and reparametrizing as @xmath80 , @xmath81",

    "it is worth to note that this result has also been obtained through first - order susy qm and by using the integral formulation of the confluent case @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that any non - singular susy transformation which departs from free particle and creates just one bound state leads precisely to a pschl - teller potential ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "an illustration of a confluent second - order susy partner potential @xmath35 , generated through this formalism from the free particle , is shown in fig .",

    "following the formalism of this work we have obtained a one - parameter family of non - singular potentials for each @xmath87 .    for the free particle",
    "the integral and differential wronskian formulae have been applied easily , since the involved integrals can be simply evaluated .",
    "nevertheless , there are some other potentials for which the calculation of the corresponding integrals looks complicated but the differential formalism can be applied straightforwardly .",
    "we will show next an example of this situation .",

    "the potentials have @xmath93 band edges which define @xmath94 allowed and @xmath94 forbidden bands .",
    "they belong to a class of finite - gap periodic systems where the non - linear supersymmetry plays an important role .",
    "for example , lam potentials have been used to model a non - relativistic electron in periodic electric and magnetic field configurations which produce a 1d crystal @xcite .",
    "in addition , these potentials admit isospectral super - extensions @xcite and they can be used to display hidden symmetries in quantum dynamical problems , specially in soliton dynamics @xcite . note that lam potentials are particular cases of the associated lam potentials , which have been studied previously in the context of higher - order susy qm @xcite .    .",

    "this can be achieved by choosing @xmath47 as one of the two bloch functions associated to @xmath44 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the real and imaginary half - periods of @xmath91 @xcite , and @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the non - elliptic weierstrass functions @xcite .",
