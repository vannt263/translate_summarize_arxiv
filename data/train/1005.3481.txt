    "the question whether interacting fermions form a landau fermi liquid state at low temperatures or rather transform into something commonly referred to as singular or non - fermi liquid is a very fundamental one .",
    "a theoretical description requires at least a qualitative understanding of the low temperature phase in order to address the relevant degrees of freedom in that phase .",
    "but for strongly interacting electronic systems this information is usually lacking , and the low - energy degrees of freedom might be very different from free electrons .",
    "however , the fermi liquid picture is often appropriate at low temperatures and energies .",
    "reasons for this can be found in the stability of the fermi liquid fixed point of the renormalization group analysis@xcite or phase space arguments.@xcite in both approaches , the analyticity of the scattering vertices is crucial for the arguments .    in situations ,",
    "where the fermi liquid description fails , the origin for this is linked to low - dimensionality of the system , long - range interactions , nested fermi surfaces or the proximity to a quantum critical point , just to name a few ( see , e.g.  refs .  ) .",
    "the quasiparticle concept might still be valid , but the scattering rate is strongly enhanced and shows an unusual , i.e.  non - quadratic , temperature and frequency dependence .",
    "alternatively the quasiparticle concept may also break down completely .    in this work",
    "we will focus on the single - band hubbard model which is a minimal model for strongly correlated electron systems , and obtain a non - perturbative approximative solution by means of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft).@xcite within dmft , where only local correlations are included , the generic low temperature state of the metallic hubbard model is a fermi liquid.@xcite this is expected , since the low temperature phase of the spin-@xmath1 single impurity anderson model  the model onto which the hubbard model is mapped within dmft  is a local fermi liquid under the assumption of a `` well behaved '' medium.@xcite the fermi liquid reveals itself via a low - energy many - body bandstructure forming around the fermi level at low temperatures.@xcite due to the neglect of momentum dependent correlations in dmft the heavy quasiparticles possess the non - interacting fermi surface.@xcite a characteristic low - energy scale @xmath0 is associated with this lattice version of the kondo effect and marks the temperature scale for local - moment screening and the emergence of coherent quasiparticles .    on the other hand",
    "it is known from perturbation theory and renormalization group treatments , that a van hove singularity of the non - interacting density of states ( dos ) in the vicinity of the fermi level lead to a marginal@xcite or non - fermi liquid form of the self - energy.@xcite this should be contrasted to nested fermi liquids,@xcite where due to the nesting property of the fermi surface the phase space volume for low - energy scattering is also strongly enhanced and unusual low - energy properties emerge as well.@xcite    van hove singularities are a consequence of maxima or saddle points in the dispersion relation @xmath2 .",
    "for periodic energy bands in a crystal a certain number of these van hove singularities must occur on topological grounds ( see , e.g.  ref . ) .",
    "for example , all of the cubic lattices have noticeable van hove singularities in space dimensions @xmath3 , typically logarithmic divergences or square - root cusps .",
    "anomalous low - energy behavior can already be anticipated by recognizing , that the usual arguments of microscopic fermi liquid theory break down if a maximum or saddle point of the dispersion relation @xmath2 is found at the fermi level .",
    "then , @xmath2 _ can not _ be approximated by a linear dispersion , i.e.@xmath4 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 the fermi wave vector . around these points a quadratic ( maximum ) or hyperbolic ( saddle - point ) functional dependence @xmath7 results , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two linear independent directions in momentum space .",
    "the arguments leading to a quadratic fermi liquid energy and temperature dependence of the scattering rate , i.e.   im@xmath10 , are thus not applicable . instead , the phase space volume for scattering is strongly enhanced and anomalous @xmath11- and @xmath12-dependencies may result .",
    "if the singularity occurs in the vicinity of the fermi level , strong modifications of the low - energy and temperature properties are still expected due to a pinning effect.@xcite    in the present work we show that the non - fermi liquid signatures which were encountered in previous studies@xcite of the self - energy and transport properties can also occur in the paramagnetic phase of a strongly correlated metal within dmft .",
    "we use the two - dimensional square lattice with nearest and next - nearest neighbor hopping , @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "for @xmath15 the dispersion relation @xmath2 has saddles at the @xmath16 points in the brillouin zone ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this leads to a logarithmic divergence in the non - interacting dos , which is located at the fermi level @xmath18 for @xmath19 and moved to finite energies for @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting anomalies consist of an unusual maximum in the imaginary part of the self - energy im@xmath21 in the vicinity of the fermi level at low but finite temperatures .",
    "the concept of quasiparticles remains valid but they are strongly scattered at the flat parts of the dispersion relation and the fermi liquid formation is disturbed .",
    "the anomalous double well structure persists over a range of doping and next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath14 . at zero temperature and for half - filled square lattice",
    "the double - well structure is removed and the self - energy vanishes at the fermi level .",
    "even though the self - energy exhibits a non - fermi liquid energy dependence , the quasiparticle weight is still finite .",
    "the pinning of the van hove singularity to the fermi level , which has previously been found,@xcite is explicitly observed in the correlated metal .",
    "qualitatively similar non - fermi liquid signatures are also observed in more advanced theories which include nonlocal correlations.@xcite these features are usually attributed to the presence of strong nonlocal antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "however , in the present approach nonlocal correlations are not included and we argue that an interpretation _ exclusively _ in terms of nonlocal correlations is too simplified .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theo ] we shortly present the hubbard hamiltonian and the basic equations of dmft .",

    "the correlation self - energy enters only as an unspecified parameter [ via @xmath43 and is obtained from the solution of the effective impurity model for a given medium @xmath40 .",

    "we average over eight different discretizations@xcite of the conduction band to minimize the errors .",
    "we also performed finite temperature dmft(nrg ) calculations which were in accord with the dmft(enca ) results and confirmed the existence of the anomalous structures in the self - energy .",
