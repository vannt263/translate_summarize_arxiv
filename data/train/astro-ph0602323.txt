    "before the launch of _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ , the x - ray data provided strong support for the model of cooling flows @xcite .",
    "the x - ray imaging data of galaxy clusters showed a temperature decrease into the centers of these systems , typically by a factor of two from the ambient temperature of about 4 - 10 kev ( 5 - 12@xmath810@xmath9 k ) . within the inner 100 kpc ,",
    "the radiative cooling times for the hot gas is shorter than a hubble time , leading to the apparent inevitability that the gas would radiatively cool to much lower temperatures , and this is the basis of the cooling flow model with cooling rates of 30 - 1000 m@xmath3 yr@xmath10 .",
    "however , the existence of cooling flows has often been questioned by observers in other wavebands , who find some evidence for cooled gas and star formation , but at a level far below the rate inferred from the x - ray data @xcite .",
    "consequently , it was anticipated that _",
    "xmm _ grating spectra would show strong emission from gas that was well below the ambient temperature of the medium , representing the substantial amounts of cooling gas . while the _ xmm _ data showed the expected luminosities of the high ionization line , such as to , the emission from the lines that trace cooler gas were missing ( e.g. , , ; @xcite ) .",
    "according to these line ratios , the gas was not obviously cooling below about 2 kev ( @xmath11 k ) .",
    "either some heating mechanism turns on at 2 kev , preventing the gas from cooling further , or the gas continues to cool but these lines are not produced , due to metal inhomogenieties , turbulent mixing with cooler gas , or heating by agns @xcite .",
    "there is still good evidence for significantly cooler gas ( e.g. , 10@xmath12 k gas in perseus ) , which may be the end product of the cooling flow @xcite . however , unless one can find gas at temperatures between 10@xmath12 k and 10@xmath13 k , we would have to consider an alternative picture for the cooler gas , where it is mass lost from galaxies @xcite .",
    "a particularly good tracer of cooling gas is the @xmath1 1032 , 1038 doublet , because it dominates the radiative cooling function where it is present ( @xmath14 k ) , it can not be produced by photoionization by stars , and it lies above 912  , so it is accessible with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) . this line has been detected in abell 2597 by @xcite where they report a cooling rate of about 40 m@xmath15 yr@xmath4 within the inner 36 kpc of the cluster .",
    "they also report a nondetection , for abell 1795 , and @xcite report nondetections for abell 2029 and abell 3112 . here",
    "we report on _ fuse _ observations of abell 426 ( the perseus cluster ) , abell 1795 ( off - center observations ) , and awm 7 , all clusters that are bright in x - rays and originally expected to contain cooling flows .",
    "we find evidence for emission from perseus and abell 1795 and discuss the importance of these observations in light of x - ray and other related observations .",
    "we use a hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "all of the _ fuse _ observations were obtained with the large aperture ( 30square ; _ lwrs _ ) in time - tag mode .",
    "the observations were screened for particle outbursts , with the resulting good data separated into day and night components . each individual detector segment for each observation was combined using the procedure ttag_combine before applying the calfuse pipeline ( origianally , version 2.4 was used but we also tried version 3.0 , which led to no noticable changes for the spectral region of interest ) . for observations obtained during the day ,",
    "the background is significantly higher than for observations taken at night .",
    "the background is composed of a combination of discrete airglow lines ( e.g. , from h@xmath16 , , n@xmath17 ) plus a diffuse scattered component .",
    "for the data taken during the day , this background is often stronger than the weak signals that we seek , so we usually used the data obtained during nighttime ( discussed separately for each of our targets ) . for the perseus cluster and awm 7",
    ", the redshifted doublet falls near 1050  , and in this regions the channel with the highest s / n is the lif1a .",
    "as the addition of other channels reduces the s / n , we discuss only the lif1a data for these clusters . for abell 1795 ,",
    "the line is shifted into the 10951098    region , where the only useful detector is the lif2a channel . for purposes of displaying the data ,",
    "the spectra are binned and smoothed , although for the extraction of line fluxes , the unsmoothed data were used .",
    "this is one of the most frequently observed clusters and it was one of the most compelling cases for cooling flows , as it showed an x - ray surface brightness distribution with a sharply peaked diffuse emission , extensive filaments from 10@xmath12 k gas , and ongoing star formation @xcite .",
    "it also hosts an agn with strong extended radio emission ( 3c 84 ) and the central object has been listed as a seyfert 1.5 galaxy as well as a bl lac type object .",
    "in addition to the central dominant galaxy , ngc 1275 , at a redshift of 5264 km s@xmath4 , there is a higher velocity gaseous component , at about 8200 km s@xmath4 ( first noted by @xcite ) , which contains warm ionized gas , neutral gas , and molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the emission line gas is seen over a 6diameter region , which is similar in size to the cooling radius of the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "consequently , only a fraction of the cooling gas may be contained in the lwrs ( 30  square centered on ngc 1275 ; figure [ fig : a426_halpha ] ) , so we may be missing a considerable amount of cooling gas , although this pointing contains the brightest h@xmath18 emitting gas and x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the data were taken in 16 october 2002 , with a total exposure time of 29.1 ksec , of which 13.0 ksec is night data , used in our analysis .",
    "several emission lines are detected , including ly@xmath16 and both lines near the redshift of ngc 1275 ( figure [ fig : a426_ovi ] ) .",
    "the analysis of these lines is complicated by a variety of absorption lines , mostly from the galaxy , but also from material within the perseus cluster . from the milky way , we see strong absorption lines from h@xmath17 in addition to the usual atomic lines , but this is to be expected given the low galactic latitude and high extinction in this direction ( a@xmath19 = 0.70 mag ; @xcite ) .",
    "this absorption affects the strong @xmath20 1032 line , which is absorbed on its blue and red sides by galactic h@xmath17 .",
    "in addition , there is absorption due to h@xmath17 from the higher redshift system in perseus ( 8200 km s@xmath4 ) , but this is to be expected as molecular gas was previously known to exist at this velocity @xcite .",
    "fortunately , no strong absorption features occur near the weaker line , so we are able to obtain a line flux . for the @xmath20 1038 line ,",
    "the flux is 2.9 @xmath8 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 ( @xmath2 0.4 @xmath8 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 ) , the line center is at 1055.9 @xmath2 0.1  , and the width is 0.7 @xmath2 0.2   ( fwhm ) , while for the 1032   line , the flux is 2.9 @xmath8 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 , which we regard as a lower limit due to the absorption .",
    "it is difficult to correct the strong line for absorption in a reliable manner , so we use the line ratio ( of 2:1 ) and the strength of the @xmath20 1038 line to infer the strength of the stronger line to be about 5.8 @xmath8 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 ( @xmath2 0.9 @xmath8 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 ) . after making an extinction correction , f(@xmath20 1032 ) = 4.2 @xmath8 10 - 14 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 ( @xmath2 0.6 @xmath8 10@xmath23 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 ) , and for a distance of 75.2 mpc ,",
    "the luminosity in the @xmath20 1032 line is 2.9 @xmath8 10@xmath24 erg s@xmath4 ( @xmath2 0.4 @xmath8 10@xmath24 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "in addition , the ly@xmath16 line is detected in emission , which was expected since ly@xmath18 was detected previously .",
    "the cluster has a mean redshift z = 0.062476 @xmath2 0.00030 @xcite and the velocity dispersion of the cluster is 810 km s@xmath4 ( @xmath25z = 0.0027 ) . the velocity of the central dominant galaxy is slightly higher , at z = 0.06326 .",
    "this cluster has a filament that extends about 40   to the south of the central dominant galaxy and is detected in both optical emission line gas as well as diffuse x - rays @xcite .",
    "the filament is at least a factor of two cooler than the ambient cluster gas and the radiative cooling time is 3 @xmath8 10@xmath26 yr , about the age inferred from its length and velocity .",
    "we obtained an observation at this off - center location with the lwrs ( 30  south of the cd galaxy ) , and in addition , we reanalyzed the central pointing ( originally discussed by @xcite ) , which contains the central dominant galaxy , the peak of the x - ray emission , and a significant fraction of the 10@xmath5 k gas .",
    "the total exposure time of the central pointing is 37.1 ksec , of which 17.0 ksec were useful nighttime data , and those are the observations used below .",
    "the central galaxy has an apparent magnitude of 15.2 , so if the ratio of v to fuv flux was typical for an early - type galaxy ( e.g. , ngc 5846 ) , the flux near 1115   ( 1050   in the rest frame ) would have been about 5 @xmath8 10@xmath27 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 ( after @xcite ) , but the observed flux is 2.7 @xmath8 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 , about five times larger ( figure [ fig : a1795_ovi_n1399 ] ) .",
    "there is a range in the fuv to v flux of early - type galaxies @xcite , and some luminous galaxies are a magnitude brighter in their fuv flux ( e.g. , ngc 1399 ) , so it is possible that starlight from an old population can account for half of the fuv continua . the remainder , if not most of the fuv continua , is probably due to young stars , as discussed by @xcite in their imaging study of the center of abell 1795 with the optical monitor on _ xmm _ , which has uv channels .",
    "when we scale the uv continuum of ngc 1399 to the region beyond 1110    ( 1044   in the rest frame ) , the two most significant features in the entire lif2a spectrum occur at 1096.8   and 1106.4  .",
    "this first feature corresponds to the location of the strong line at the redshift of the central galaxy and the optical emission line gas in abell 1795 .",
    "we believe that the second feature is associated with young hot stars that have been formed recently and create much of the uv continuum .",
    "there can be a few significant spectral differences for hot stars in this wavelength range @xcite .",
    "the spectrum rises from the minimum caused by ly@xmath16 absorption ( 1091  ) , although the feature is typically 10  fwhm and damped , leading to the slow rise in both the young hot stars ( figure [ fig : a1795_hotstars ] ) and the old hot stars in ngc 1399 ( figure [ fig : a1795_ovi_n1399 ] ) .",
    "young hot stars can have a wind , and depending upon the mass flux , p - cygni profiles can occur @xcite , which causes the peak near 1104.51109.5    ( 1038.51043.5   in the rest frame ) , corresponding to the peak observed in the lif2a spectrum .",
    "the weak line is not apparent , but its wavelength corresponds to an absorption feature in an o / b star . if we subtract the hot star stellar atmosphere from the spectrum , an emission line would appear at the location of the @xmath20 1038 line , so it is possible that both lines exist .    in trying to determine the strength of the strong line , we note that a strong galactic absorption line would lie near the line center . using the stellar continua as a baseline",
    ", we find that the line flux is 2.3 @xmath8 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 ( @xmath2 0.6 @xmath8 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 ) , with a line center at 1069.9 ( z = 0.0630 ) and a line width of 2.3   fwhm . the absorption - corrected flux for the strong line is 2.7 @xmath8 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 ( @xmath2 0.7 @xmath8 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 ) , and for a distance of 268 mpc , the luminosity is 2.3 @xmath8 10@xmath24 erg s@xmath4 ( @xmath2 0.6 @xmath8 10@xmath24 erg s@xmath4 ) .    the line emission from the central pointing was listed as an upper limit by @xcite .",
    "since that time , improvements in the pipeline processing have reduced the noise in the spectral extraction and our understanding of the underlying stellar continuum has improved .",
    "there was also a concern of significant airglow contamination with the strong line from n@xmath17 when pointing near the illuminated disk of the earth , the strongest near the line being at 1098.1   ( there is a much stronger n@xmath17 line at 1034  ) . in comparing the night - only data with the day - plus - night data ,",
    "there is a tremendous reduction in the 1034   line , and a small fraction of the emission at 1098.1   decreases .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the 1098.1   airglow line contributes significantly to the line , especially as it is to the red of the line defined by its fwhm .",
    "although it is not central to the primary science , the @xmath20 977 line is detected in the lif1a channel ( figure [ fig : a1795_ciii ] ) .",
    "it is the strongest feature in that channel not due to airglow and has a central wavelength of 1038.5  , with a flux of 4.2@xmath8 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 @xmath2 0.5 @xmath8 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 .",
    "the observation for the off - center pointing of abell 1795 was taken at two times in 2004 , with total exposure times of 6.49 ksec and 18.86 ksec , although we are using only the night data since the background is significantly lower , leading to a higher s / n for the final spectra .",
    "the final useful night time data had exposure times of 4.48 ksec and 12.7 ksec or a total time of 17.2 ksec .",
    "we use the combined night spectrum for the analysis , in which the airglow lines from oxygen and nitrogen are so weak as to be undetectable .",
    "the detector with the highest s / n in the wavelength region where the redshifted emission would occur is the lif2a channel , and the strongest feature in this channel occurs at 1095.1  , which is approximately the redshifted wavelength of the @xmath20 1032 line , z = 0.06122 ( figure [ fig : a1795off ] ) .",
    "this line is 370 km s@xmath4 to the blue of the mean redshift of the cluster , which has a velocity dispersion of 810 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , the optical emission line gas is also blueshifted at this location by 100 - 200 km s@xmath4 , and the line width is broad and extends to the velocity of the emission @xcite .",
    "this line is detected at the 3 @xmath28 level and with a flux of 1.4@xmath810@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 @xmath2 0.5@xmath810@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 , and the fwhm is 1.0 @xmath2 0.2  .",
    "the weaker line , which is not detected , would have been a 1.5 @xmath28 feature . to be conservative",
    ", we view this as a possible detection and discuss it accordingly .",
    "a very faint stellar continuum is present as well , with a peak emission in the 1105 - 1120   range ( 1040 - 1053   in the rest frame ) , as expected for a hot stellar continuum from young stars ; the zero point is too uncertain to place a secure flux level on the continuum .",
    "another feature that one might expect , either from cooling gas or photoionized gas , is the @xmath20 977 line , and there is a marginal detection of this line at the 2 @xmath28 level , 1.4@xmath810@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 @xmath2 0.7@xmath810@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 .",
    "the cluster awm7 is a nearby x - ray bright cluster with an elliptical galaxy at the center , at a velocity of 5194 km s@xmath4 .",
    "it lies at l , b = 146 -15.6 and the extinction is e(b - v ) = 0.116 mag @xcite .",
    "it was observed on 26 september 2003 with a total exposure time of 21.1 ksec , but the s / n is highest when using the night - only data , which comprises 14.1 ksec .",
    "the spectra show no features at all , aside from the usual h@xmath16 airglow line . from the noise characteristics of the spectrum ,",
    "we derive a 3@xmath28 upper limit of 3@xmath810@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 to an line of width 300 km s@xmath4 .",
    "after correction for extinction , the strong line has an upper limit to its luminosity of 8 @xmath8 10@xmath29 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the ovi luminosities can be converted into mass cooling rates using radiative cooling models .",
    "since these ovi lines carry the cooling through this temperature region , the line strength is the product of the thermal energy of the gas at 10@xmath0 k and the rate at which matter is cooling through that region @xcite .",
    "factors such as the metallicity of the gas , departures from thermal equilibrium , and whether the gas is isochoric or isobaric only modify the line strength modestly . for the conversion from l(@xmath201032 ) to a mass cooling rate",
    ", we use the value discussed by @xcite ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , of @xmath30 = ( l(@xmath201032)/9@xmath31 erg s@xmath4 ) m@xmath15 yr@xmath4 . using this conversion ,",
    "the upper limit to the cooling rate for awm 7 is 9 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 within r = 6.1 kpc , and the detected cooling rate for abell 426 is 32@xmath25 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 within the central r = 6.2 kpc . for abell 426 ,",
    "the cooling radius is about an order of magnitude larger than the _ fuse _ aperture and the optical emission line gas region is also considerably larger , so we may be missing much of the emission .",
    "therefore , we regard this cooling rate as a minimum value .",
    "the cooling rate for the central pointing of abell 1795 is about 26@xmath27 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 in the central r = 22 kpc region .",
    "if we treat the off - center pointing as a detection , it represents an additional 16@xmath26 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , or a total measured in the cluster of 42@xmath29 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 . once again , much of the cooling gas may not be contained within our apertures , so the total cooling rate for the cluster is likely to be larger .",
    "we can compare our measurements with the three other rich clusters that have been observed with _",
    "fuse _ , abell 2597 , abell 2029 , and abell 3112 @xcite .",
    "when we convert these published values to the same hubble constant and cooling rate scale , the upper limits for abell 2029 and abell 3112 are 27 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ( r = 27 kpc ) , and 25 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ( r = 26 kpc ) , while for abell 2597 , the detected value is 35 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ( r = 30 kpc ) . in summary , of the six clusters",
    "observed , three are detected in the lines .",
    "there are other characteristics that distingish the clusters detected in from those that were not .",
    "the three clusters , abell 426 , abell 1795 , and abell 2597 have extensive optical emission lines and also have evidence for recent or ongoing star formation . although the other galaxy clusters were considered cooling flow clusters from their broad - band x - ray data , they are not known to have optical emission line filaments or star formation , such as abell 2029 @xcite .",
    "it had been suggested by others that the combination of peaked x - ray emission with short cooling times , optical emission line gas , and young stars constituted a strong case for the cooling flow paradigm ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the counterargument was that the cooled gas was mass loss from a recently stripped galaxy , and the disturbance had led to star formation in the gas @xcite . in this view , the gas does not cool from the hot ambient cluster medium .",
    "however , the presence of emission shows that , at least in some clusters , gas is cooling through the 10@xmath0 k regime at a rate of at least 30 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 .",
    "the original cooling flow estimates for these clusters are typically an order of magnitude larger .",
    "either the emission that we detected is only a fraction of the cooling gas , which is possible since the apertures cover only a fraction of the cooling flow region , or the cooling rate is an order of magnitude lower than originally estimated .",
    "a significantly lower cooling rate would , in general , be consistent with the weak x - ray cooling lines , and models have been developed along these lines @xcite .",
    "we can compare the cooling rates inferred from the emission with the constraints from the x - ray data , and in particular , the _ xmm _ rgs data .",
    "there is not yet a published rgs spectrum for abell 426 , but there are analyses for both abell 1795 and abell 2597 .",
    "the epic plus rgs spectrum for abell 2597 implies an x - ray cooling rate of 50@xmath210 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ( adjusted for the h@xmath32 used here ) and a cooling radius of about 90 kpc @xcite .",
    "this cooling rate is somewhat greater than the value that we measure , suggesting that cooling gas may extend beyond the _ fuse _ lwrs aperture .",
    "if the cooling rate increases linearly with radius out to the cooling radius , as suggested by theory @xcite , the value inferred from the _ fuse _ data would become 50 - 60 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , the same as found from the x - ray data .",
    "the study that includes abell 1795 @xcite places an upper limit to the cooling of 30 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , which may be in conflict with the data that implies 3040 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 .",
    "if such a conflict exists , it would imply that non - steady cooling of material is involved , such as turbulent mixing layers @xcite , although there are other possibilities @xcite .",
    "this promising line of study of emission is limited by the sensitivity of current instrumentation .",
    "natural follow - up observations , such as the mapping of throughout the potential cooling region will have to wait for future missions .",

    "also , we would like to thank birgit otte and renato dupke for their comments and suggestions in writing this paper .",

    "<S> a prediction of the galaxy cluster cooling flow model is that as gas cools from the ambient cluster temperature , emission lines are produced in gas at subsequently decreasing temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> gas passing through 10@xmath0 k emits in the lines of @xmath11032 , 1035 , and here we report a _ fuse _ study of these lines in three cooling flow clusters , abell 426 , abell 1795 , and awm 7 . </S>",
    "<S> no emission was detected from awm 7 , but is detected from the centers of abell 426 and abell 1795 , and possibly to the south of the center in abell 1795 , where x - ray and optical emission line filaments lie . in abell 426 , these line luminosities imply a cooling rate of 32@xmath26 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 within the central r = 6.2 kpc region , while for abell 1795 , the central cooling rate is 26@xmath27 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ( within r = 22 kpc ) , and about 42@xmath29 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 including the southern pointing .    </S>",
    "<S> including other studies , three of six clusters have emission , and they also have star formation as well as emission lines from 10@xmath5 k gas . these observations are generally consistent with the cooling flow model but at a rate closer to 30 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 than originally suggested values of 10@xmath610@xmath7 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 . </S>"
