    "how has the environment affected the star formation properties of spiral galaxies in clusters ?",
    "previous measurements of the global star formation rates at h@xmath0 , uv , and far - infrared wavelengths of cluster spirals show that some cluster spirals have reduced global star formation ( kennicutt 1983 , bicay & giovanelli 1987 , kodaira et al .",
    "1990 , moss & whittle 1993 ) , others have similar global star formation rates ( kennicutt , bothun , & schommer 1984 , gavazzi et al .",
    "1991 , donas et al .",
    "1990 ) , and some have enhanced star formation rates ( moss & whittle 1993 , bennett & moss 1998 ) with respect to field counterparts .",
    "studies of the spatial distributions of star formation have been more limited and have usually concentrated on field spiral samples ( e.g. , hodge & kennicutt 1983 ; ryder & dopita 1993 ; phillips 1993 ; gonzlez delgado et al . 1997 ; hameed & devereux 1999 ) . based on these studies , star formation tends to be distributed over much of the optical disk , often concentrated along spiral arms and in rings . to date",
    "there has been little comparison of high resolution spatial distributions of star formation for large samples of cluster and field galaxies .",
    "such comparisons could help reveal where in the disk star formation has been reduced or enhanced in cluster galaxies , leading to strong constraints on the environmental mechanisms which transform cluster galaxies .",
    "the r and h@xmath0 images presented in this paper are part of an extensive study of the spatial distributions of massive star formation in nearly 100 virgo cluster and isolated spiral and lenticular galaxies .",
    "the main goal of the work is to better understand the relative distributions of star formation in cluster and isolated spirals and to probe the role of the environment in the star formation properties of cluster spirals .",
    "the sample presented in this paper is drawn from the nearby virgo cluster of galaxies .",
    "the virgo cluster is an excellent laboratory for studies of star formation histories since it is near enough that galaxy morphology can be examined in detail .",
    "it has also been surveyed at many different wavelengths , including aperture h@xmath0 ( kennicutt 1983 ) , hi ( warmels 1988 , cayatte et al .",
    "1990 , hoffman et al .",
    "1989 ) , co ( kenney & young 1989 ) , near - ir ( boselli et al . 1997 ) , radio continuum ( kotanyi 1980 ) and x - ray ( boehringer et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the structure and membership of the cluster are well - studied ( binggeli , sandage , & tammann 1985 ; binggeli , tammann , & sandage 1987 ; binggeli , popescu , & tammann 1993 ; yasuda , fukugita , & okamura 1997 ; gavazzi et al .",
    "1999 , schindler , binggeli , & boehringer 1999 ) .",
    "because the cluster has not yet relaxed , there is a enhanced likelihood of detecting ongoing environmental alteration .",
    "this paper presents continuum - subtracted h@xmath0+[n ii ] and broadband r images of 63 bright spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "r and h@xmath0 profiles are derived from surface photometry of the images .",
    "isophotal radii , disk scalelengths , integrated fluxes , and concentration parameters are measured from the radial profiles .",
    "total h@xmath0 fluxes derived from 50 of the images presented here have already been published in young et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , although the calibration has been adjusted in this paper .",
    "this study marks the first presentation of h@xmath0 spatial distributions for a large and highly complete sample of virgo cluster spirals .",
    "( previous results based on h@xmath0 images and surface brightnesses for several virgo cluster spirals are found in kennicutt 1989 ) in addition , this study presents r surface photometry , which has been relatively rare for virgo cluster spirals .",
    "( some r surface photometry is available for several galaxies within large surveys , e.g. , de jong & van der kruit 1994 ) .",
    "in fact , even total r magnitudes have previously been published for only about half of this sample ( pierce & tully 1988 ; schroeder & visvanathan 1996 ) .",
    "this paper is part of a series .",
    "images and radial profiles of 30 isolated spiral galaxies are presented in koopmann & kenney ( 2001a ) .",
    "concentration parameters derived from the r radial profiles and h@xmath0 fluxes normalized by the r fluxes are used in koopmann & kenney ( 1998 ) to show that the hubble classification scheme is inadequate in describing the morphology of at least 25% of virgo cluster spirals .",
    "the radial distributions of r and h@xmath0 light of the virgo cluster and isolated galaxies are analyzed and compared in koopmann & kenney ( 2001b ) .",

    "the rest of the cluster has a filamentary structure , some of which is extended at least partially along the line of sight .",
    "one filament is the southern extension region of the cluster , which is a cloud of galaxies located adjacent to and at about the same distance as the central components ( binggeli et al .",
    "three clouds of galaxies , the w ( de vaucouleurs 1961 ) , w , and m ( ftaclas et al .",
    "1984 ) clouds , are projected on the cluster ; studies consistently place these clouds in the near - background at about two times the distance of the cluster .",
    "membership information from the virgo cluster catalog ( binggeli et al .",

    "figure  [ virloc ] shows a map of the locations of sample galaxies , with the projected regions of different clouds indicated .",
    "sample galaxies are located throughout the cluster , with a range of 1 - 10@xmath3 projected distance from m87 .",
    "possible members of the w , w , and m clouds were avoided ; however the data of binggeli et al .",
    "( 1993 ) suggest that 4 galaxies in our sample may be located in these clouds ( ngc 4189 , ngc 4303 , ngc 4527 , and ngc 4536 )",

    "we assume a distance of 16 mpc for the virgo cluster ( jacoby et al . 1992 ; yasuda et al .",
    "1997 ; kelson et al .",
    "most of our analyses were designed to be distance - independent , since we will compare to a sample of isolated galaxies of different distances .",
    "hence the possibility of a significant depth of the virgo cluster will not influence most of our conclusions .",
    "the virgo cluster sample galaxies range in type from s0-sm .",
    "the galaxies were chosen to have b@xmath1 brighter than 13.5 ( corresponding to m@xmath4 of -17.5 at an assumed distance of 16 mpc ) and inclinations mostly @xmath5 75@xmath3 .",
    "seven of the 63 galaxies have higher inclination ; some of these were observed in the same field of view as target galaxies .",
    "observations of 50 of the galaxies were obtained as part of a study of star formation rates and efficiencies in 120 spiral galaxies ( young et al .",
    "this study had as selection criteria iras flux cutoffs of s@xmath6 @xmath7 5 jy or s@xmath8 @xmath7 10 jy .",
    "thirteen additional galaxies , mostly of cataloged hubble type s0-sa , were observed as part of the current study and were not constrained by the iras flux criteria .",

    "note that several galaxies have mixed classifications like sc / sa and that there are disagreements between the two major classifiers for a number of galaxies .",
    "the important issue of morphological classification is addressed further in koopmann & kenney ( 1998 , 2001b ) .",

    "characteristics of the filters used in the observations are given in table 5 .",
    "the fields - of - view of the observations were large enough to image each galaxy to at least an isophotal radius of 24 mag arcsec@xmath12 and , in most cases , sufficient blank sky to accurately estimate the sky background of the chip .",
    "r observations of several of the larger virgo galaxies obtained in the late 1980 s were repeated with larger format ccd s in the 1990 s to obtain a larger field - of - view .",
    "observations of the spectrophotometric standard stars from the lists of massey et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and hamuy et al .",
    "( 1992 ) were made for the calibration to absolute flux .",
    "most observations obtained between 1992 and 1997 included exposures of landolt standards ( 1992a ) to derive the extinction coefficient .",
    "all images were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded using 5 - 10 dome - flats and/or twilight sky flats . for images taken at the ctio 0.9-m , illumination corrections derived from twilight sky flats applied to the dome - flattened images significantly improved the flatness of the r sky background ( from @xmath13 2 - 3% to @xmath51% ) .",
    "standard iraf ( tody 1993 ) tasks were used for the processing steps .",
    "for some galaxies , 2 - 3 exposures were obtained .",
    "the images were registered and aligned using the centroids of bright stars , and averaged using the _ combine task in iraf , with cosmic ray rejection based on the noise parameters of the ccd . in the case of seeing differences , images were convolved with a gaussian function to the worst seeing before combining . for these images and single exposure images ,",
    "the _ bclean task in the software package figaro and the _ imedit task in iraf were used to remove cosmic rays . _ _ _      extinction coefficients were derived from exposures of landolt standards where possible .",
    "otherwise the standard extinction curve at kpno or ctio was used .",
    "most of the r and all the h@xmath0 images were flux calibrated based on spectrophotometric standard stars ( massey et al .",
    "1988 , hamuy et al .",
    "1992 ) .    for most of the observations ,",
    "the filter response curve was convolved with the spectrum of the standard to compute the expected flux within the filter .",
    "this approach is especially important for flux calibration of images in the harris r filter .",
    "the h@xmath0 calibrations prior to 1992 were made by approximating the total flux expected in the filter by integrating the magnitude of the standard at the central wavelength of the filter over the filter band width .",
    "this approximation has an accuracy on the order of 1 - 2% for the narrow - band h@xmath0 filter , well below the error contributed from other sources .",
    "this approximation is not appropriate for the broadband r filters , particularly the harris r filter , due to its complex transmission curve .      because we wish to compare r profiles , fluxes , and size scales within the virgo sample and to the comparison isolated sample ( koopmann & kenney 2001a ) , standardization to the harris r system",
    "is necessary .",
    "galaxies observed in nearly mould r were transformed to harris r. because no transformation equation was available in the literature , one was derived through observations of a series of landolt ( 1992a ) standard stars in both filters .",
    "the transformation was well described by a simple multiplicative factor , with no color dependence : @xmath14 where f@xmath15 is the flux in r and f@xmath16 is the flux in the nearly mould r filter . however",
    ", the scatter in the multiplicative factor introduces an additional 4% error in the r fluxes of galaxies observed in the nearly mould r filter .",
    "all quantities derived from the r photometry presented in this and succeeding papers are calibrated to the harris r system .",
    "r flux values can be converted to r magnitudes using a zero point of 13.945 , which was derived from comparison of spectrophotometric standard star absolute fluxes and magnitudes listed by landolt ( 1992b ) .",
    "this relationship was also used to flux calibrate two r images for which spectrophotometric standards were not available .",
    "there are few previous measurements of r surface photometry for virgo cluster galaxies .",
    "total r magnitudes are presented by pierce and tully ( 1988 ) for 22 galaxies in our sample , and by schroeder & visvanathan(1996 ) for 33 galaxies in our sample .",
    "we find a correlation between the total r magnitudes and our isophotal ( to 24 r mag arcsec@xmath12 ) magnitudes for both sets of data , as shown in figure  [ rphotcomp ] .",
    "the pierce & tully magnitudes are 0.25 magnitude higher in the median than our isophotal magnitudes , with a 5% uncertainty in the slope of a linear correlation .",
    "the schroeder & visvanathan magnitudes are 0.11 magnitude higher in the median , with a 3% uncertainty in the slope of a linear correlation .",
    "the h@xmath0 images are calibrated to absolute flux units .",
    "no correction was made for contamination by the 2 [ n ii ] lines ( @xmath10 @xmath10=6548.1 , 6583.8  ) , which also lie within the filter bandpass .",
    "this assumption is based on the work of kennicutt & kent ( 1983 ) and kennicutt ( 1992 ) , who evaluate the relative [ n ii ] contribution to the flux in h ii regions .",
    "they find a median [ n ii]/h@xmath0 of 0.53 , with a scatter that is significantly smaller than the scatter in overall h@xmath0 emission strengths in spiral galaxies .",
    "hereafter we will abbreviate h@xmath0+[n ii ] as h@xmath0 .",
    "h@xmath0 observations prior to 1992 were originally calibrated using the barnes and hayes ( 1984 ) standard star manual .",
    "the fluxes based on this system appear in young et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in this paper",
    ", we adjust the calibration to the standard star measurements of massey et al .",
    "( 1988 ) for consistency between different observations and our isolated sample ( 11 - 20% lower in flux depending on standard and filter ) .",
    "the measured h@xmath0 fluxes are well correlated with those measured by kennicutt & kent ( 1983 ) for 23 galaxies in common , as shown in figure  [ koopkenn ] .",
    "the solid line shows a one - to - one correlation . there is a considerable scatter , with some individual galaxies deviant by @xmath7 30% . however , most galaxies agree within 30% and the mean difference for the whole sample is close to 0 .",
    "the differences for individual galaxies are most likely due to uncertainties in the continuum subtraction background sky levels , as discussed in sections  [ skyerr ] and  [ hacssect ] .",
    "the most important source of error in the broadband radial profiles of the outer disks of galaxies is the uncertainty in the sky background .",
    "it is therefore critical to obtain as flat a sky background as possible and carefully measure the uncertainty in the sky level .",
    "the standard deviation in the background and the uncertainty in the overall sky level were determined by measuring 4 - 6 blank regions of the sky , and by examining line and column plots , which were especially useful in detecting large scale gradients .",
    "standard deviations and uncertainties in the overall sky level are listed in table 3 in units of @xmath17 erg cm@xmath12 s@xmath19 ( a zeropoint of 13.945 may be used to convert the r values to magnitudes ) .",
    "occasionally a planar gradient remained in the sky background after processing , particularly in images obtained during bright time .",
    "where necessary , and where adequate blank sky was available , a planar surface was fit ( using _ imsurfit in iraf ) to the sky background and subtracted from the image to improve sky flatness . where higher order gradients remained , usually due to improper flat fields or scattered light , the effect was incorporated into the sky background error . _    the uncertainty in the r sky is typically 0.5 - 2% , except for cases in which the galaxy fills much of the ccd frame .",
    "the sky background error tends to be higher in the narrow - band h@xmath0 , ranging from 1 - 6% .",
    "waller ( 1990 ) describes the use of broadband filters to continuum subtract narrow - line observations .",
    "we follow his procedure .    before continuum subtraction ,",
    "the r and h@xmath0 images were background subtracted , aligned , and convolved to the same fwhm .",
    "the r image was scaled to the h@xmath0 image based on aperture photometry of 5 - 15 foreground stars .",
    "this scale factor often needs adjustment , especially since the foreground field stars and the galaxy may be different in color .",
    "adjustments were made iteratively until a satisfactory subtraction was obtained over the majority of the galaxy disk .",
    "uncertainties in the scale factor and therefore in the estimate of the continuum level are 2 - 5% .",
    "although these numbers appear small , they can result in a much higher uncertainty in the measured h@xmath0 flux or surface brightness , since the continuum overwhelms the h@xmath0 emission ( see section  [ errors ] . )",
    "an additional source of uncertainty is the assumption of a constant scale factor across the galaxy , especially if there are significant color changes caused by changes in stellar populations across the disk .",
    "assumption of a constant scale factor for the central regions and the disk is particularly problematic ( see rand 1996 ) .",
    "often central regions have negative residuals when the disk is well fit .",
    "examples in this sample include ngc 4569 , which has a very blue nucleus ( see also keel 1996 ) , ngc 4694 , and ngc 4527 .",
    "ideally , foreground unsaturated stars should disappear if the images have been carefully registered and the seeing matched .",
    "however , the point spread functions are often non - gaussian and different in the r and h@xmath0 filters due to a number of factors , including the difference in the thicknesses of the r and h@xmath0 filters , slight collimation errors , slight guiding errors , and differences in the focus between the two frames .",
    "therefore , residuals often remain on the brighter stars due to imperfect continuum subtraction .",
    "( in some cases , there are systematic patterns in the stellar residuals which can be used as a diagnostic for the accuracy of the telescope collimation . )",
    "the relative fluxes of the star in the r image and the residuals in the h@xmath0 continuum subtracted image ( summing the absolute value of counts ) are usually on the order of 1 - 2% .",
    "residuals near the galaxy were removed using the pixel replacement routines in the iraf task _ imedit .",
    "_    examination of the stellar residual pattern for images taken during the february 1995 run at kpno 0.9-m telescope revealed a slight mismatch between the pixel scales of the r and h@xmath0 images .",
    "the iraf tasks geomap and geotran were used to rescale the images to the same pixel scale before continuum subtraction .",
    "the use of a broadband r filter as a substitute for an off - line narrowband filter allows significant observing time savings , making a survey of this size practical . however , there is a trade - off in accuracy ( see pogge 1992 ) for two reasons .",
    "broadband and interference filters often differ in thickness and response to light , so can cause differing point - spread functions and even small plate scale differences , as noted above .",
    "in addition , the larger bandwidth of the r filter means that the derived value of the continuum is less certain and may be subject to color effects across the filter .",
    "even small uncertainties in the continuum level are important , since they cause large uncertainties in the h@xmath0 flux , especially in regions of weak or diffuse emission .",
    "to estimate the extent of error due to the use of a broadband filter rather than a narrowband filter , we compared 2 h@xmath0 continuum subtracted images of the galaxy ngc 4102 , kindly provided to us by shardha jogee .",
    "these images were taken during our february 1995 run .",
    "in one , the continuum was derived from an image taken with a narrowband h@xmath0 offline filter ( @xmath10 = 6653  , @xmath20 = 68  ) and in the other , from a harris r image .",
    "stellar residuals are present in both continuum - subtracted images and differ by 2 - 3% in the total flux ( summing the absolute value of residual counts ) .",
    "the total h@xmath0 flux of the galaxy is the same to within 3% .",
    "the radial profiles in h@xmath0 have the same shape and no systematic dependence on the continuum - subtracting filter .",
    "aperture photometry of low h@xmath0 surface brightness areas in the galaxy results in a 5 - 10% difference between the images , with the offline filter producing lower fluxes .",
    "a significant part of these differences can be attributed to uncertainties in the sky level and scale factor in each image .",
    "based on these tests , we conclude that the r filter does a reasonable job at continuum subtracting h@xmath0 , with error contributions smaller than the other sources of uncertainty , with the probable exception of galaxies with very weak h@xmath0 emission .    in summary",
    ", systematic errors typically cause a 20 - 30% uncertainty in total h@xmath0 fluxes and surface brightnesses .",
    "before surface photometry can be performed on an r image , the stars must be removed or masked .",
    "daophot ( stetson 1987 ) was used to find stars across the image .",
    "rather than removing the stars ( which involves an iterative determination of the point spread function across the chip and does not ever fully remove stars ) , we chose in most cases to make a pixel mask image . in the first pass",
    ", sources found within the area of the galaxy disk were excluded from the mask , since hii regions are also detected by daophot .",
    "stars superposed on the disk and stars missed by daophot were masked by hand using iraf centering and the _ badpiximage routine .",
    "members of galaxy pairs were masked in a similar manner before surface photometry was derived .",
    "mask images were also necessary for the h@xmath0 image in the case of galaxy pairs or severe stellar residuals from stars which were saturated in the r image . _",
    "r and h@xmath0 images and surface photometry are presented for each galaxy in figure  [ virim ] .",
    "galaxies are ordered according to ngc / ic number , with morphological information indicated on the plots .",
    "derived photometric scalelengths are indicated in the surface photometry plots , as described in the figure caption .",
    "deriving a radial profile of a galaxy consisted of several steps : determination of center , the axial ratio ( ratio of minor to major axis lengths ) and position angle , careful measurement of sky background error , and the surface photometry . in this section , we discuss the derivation of the radial profiles , quantities derived from the profiles , and the errors .",
    "the center of the galaxy was determined from the r image using centroiding via the _ center task in iraf .",
    "several of the galaxies ( ngc 4299 , ngc 4419 , ngc 4424 ) had no obvious central peak or had a central region contaminated by bright hii regions . in these cases , the center was determined from inner isophotes or midpoints between peaks . _",
    "radial profiles were derived by assuming fixed values of the axial ratio and position angle , which were determined by examination of the outer isophotes .",
    "starting values of axial ratio and position angle were determined by eye from the outer isophotes of the galaxy and/or literature inclination values ( e.g. , rc3 , warmels 1988 ) . for several galaxies , including 2 of low inclination ,",
    "axial ratios and/or position angles determined from hi maps ( warmels 1988 ) were used . for other galaxies ,",
    "the axial ratios and position angles were adjusted as necessary to give a good fit to the outer isophotes .",
    "the conversion of axial ratios to inclination angles is not well - determined ( e.g. peletier & willner 1991 ) .",
    "the standard conversion is @xmath21 , where i is the inclination , q is the axial ratio , and q@xmath22 is the intrinsic axial ratio ( hubble 1926 ) .",
    "the intrinsic axial ratio is often assumed to be 0.2 ( holmberg 1958 ) but it may vary with type ( e.g. bottinelli et al . 1983 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the conversion to inclination is most serious for galaxies of high inclination and so is not a major source of error for this study , since most sample galaxies have inclinations less than 75@xmath3 .",
    "for example , the difference in inclination calculated by assuming an intrinsic axial ratio of 0 versus 0.2 is 3@xmath3 at 70@xmath3 .",
    "( in section  [ errors ] , we show the uncertainty in the radial surface brightness profiles is minor for a 5@xmath3 error in the inclination . )",
    "adopted axial ratios and position angles are listed in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of table  [ rtab ] .",
    "the inclination calcalated using the standard conversion with intrinsic axial ratio of 0.2 is given in parentheses after the axial ratio . the random uncertainties in the estimation of the inclination and position angle from the outer isophotes",
    "are typically 2 - 3 @xmath3 , except in the indicated cases .",
    "galaxies which have derived inclination and position angle significantly different from literature values are noted in the table .",
    "the h@xmath0 profile was measured using the same center , inclination , and position angle as for the r image .    in most cases ,",
    "r profiles of the galaxies were also derived by allowing the position angle , axial ratio , and center to vary with radius .",
    "this approach is useful in studying the variation in the position angle of bars , rings , and the intrinsic variation in the position angle or axial ratio , which might indicate a recent dynamical disturbance .",
    "position angle and/or axial ratio differences with radius are present in several galaxies in our sample .",
    "however , elliptical annuli which are allowed to vary with radius are influenced by spiral structure and are prone to errors in low surface brightness regions .",
    "in addition , the intention of this study is not to study galaxy structure in detail , but to obtain a general profile for each galaxy , which will allow us to compare the profiles and derived quantities such as concentration . for our purposes , the differences between profiles derived using fixed elliptical annuli and those using varying elliptical annuli are mostly small .",
    "a typical example is shown in figure  [ fixfl ] .      with the center , axial ratio , position angle , and sky background uncertainties determined ( as described in section  [ skyerr ] ) ,",
    "radial profiles were derived using a surface photometry program written within the interactive data language environment , hereafter _",
    "_ sphot allows determination of realistic errors , input of a bad pixel mask image , a correction for masked pixels to derive total flux , and simultaneous measurements of isophotal radii , concentration parameters , and integrated fluxes . _",
    "_    the center , axial ratio , position angle , and sky level uncertainty are read into _ sphot .",
    "if there is a mask image , the input image is first multiplied by the mask .",
    "surface photometry is begun at a radius equal to one - half of the fwhm .",
    "the minimum annulus width is equal to the fwhm , and the width increases by 10% of the fwhm for each annulus , so that larger annuli are used in the outer regions where the s / n is smaller .",
    "the program calculates the surface brightness based on the unmasked pixels whose centers fall within a given annulus .",
    "the area of the annulus is calculated using the semimajor and semiminor axes of the annulus and the flux is calculated by multiplying the surface brightness by this area .",
    "this compensates for the flux from fractional and masked pixels within the annulus . _",
    "the r radial profiles were calculated out to a radius where the error in the surface brightness exceeded the signal .",
    "the errors in radial profiles are discussed in the next section .",
    "the outermost radius of visible hii regions was determined in advance from inspection of the images , and the h@xmath0 profile was halted just outside this radius . in some cases , especially for galaxies with faint outer disk star formation or galaxies with scattered background light or poor flat fields ,",
    "this radius was beyond the point in the profile where sky uncertainty errors overwhelmed the azimuthally averaged signal . in the plots of radial profiles in figure  [ virim ] ,",
    "we indicate this radius , but plot the h@xmath0 radial profile to the outermost hii region to emphasize the extent of star formation .",
    "all profiles were corrected to face - on assuming complete transparency in the disk , i.e. , the correction 2.5log(a / b ) was applied .",
    "the assumption of complete transparency is oversimplified , especially at inner radii , but since correction factors for internal extinction are poorly known , no corrections were made .",
    "( see giovanelli et al .",
    "1994 for more discussion . )",
    "the inclination corrected radial profiles of individual galaxies are plotted with the images of the galaxies in figure  [ virim ] .",
    "there are several sources of errors in the calculation of the surface brightness at each radius .",
    "processing errors contribute a relatively small percentage of the total error , and the readnoise of the chips is low .",
    "random error is the dominant source of error in the inner regions of the surface brightness profiles and an important source of error in the integrated flux measurements .",
    "it is traced by the standard deviation in the background ( e.g. , newberry 1991 ) , which was determined using _ fitsky or _ imstat in iraf . in the outer parts of the profiles , large numbers of pixels are averaged to give the surface brightness , so the random error is small . in the ideal case of an accurately determined sky , the total error would be due only to the random error and would be equal to the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "however , the systematic error in determining the sky brightness overwhelms the small random error in the outer regions .",
    "it is therefore critical to obtain as flat a background as possible for deep surface photometry .",
    "the total error in the profiles was calculated by adding in quadrature the contributions from the random error and the sky uncertainty ( section  [ skyerr ] ) . _ _    not included in the error calculation for individual galaxies are errors in the absolute flux calibration ( @xmath13 5% ) and errors in the continuum subtraction .",
    "figure  [ radercs ] shows typical errors in the h@xmath0 radial profile due to 2% and 5% errors in the continuum level .",
    "this figure illustrates the sensitivity of h@xmath0 surface brightness to even small uncertainties in the continuum scale factor .",
    "the radial profile is sensitive to errors in the inclination .",
    "inclination errors are largest for highly inclined galaxies and galaxies with strong spiral arms . for most galaxies in this sample ,",
    "the inclination is uncertain to less than 3@xmath3 , as determined from the outer isophotes .",
    "the typical variation in the radial profile due to an error of 5@xmath3 in inclination is shown for a high inclination ( 70@xmath3 ) galaxy , ngc 4419 , and a low inclination ( 26@xmath3 ) galaxy , ngc 4394 in figure  [ incer ] .",
    "the uncertainty in the radial profile is small even in the case of the high inclination galaxy .",
    "a quantity useful as a galaxy size indicator is an outer isophotal radius measured in a broadband filter .",
    "r isophotal radii at 24 and , if possible , at 25 mag arcsec@xmath12 , were determined by interpolation of the radial profiles .",
    "90% of the galaxies have measured radii at the 25 mag arcsec@xmath12 isophote .",
    "table  [ rtab ] lists the isophotal radii in units of arcsecs in columns ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) and the corresponding total r fluxes within the isophotal radius in columns ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "total h@xmath0 fluxes were measured in three different ways .",
    "total fluxes to the radius of the outermost hii region were measured through a polygonal aperture , defined by the extent of h@xmath0 emission , using the _ polyphot task in iraf .",
    "this result can be compared to the total flux measured within the outermost elliptical annulus , measured within the surface photometry program . because the sensitivity varied between images , we also measured an integrated flux within the radius , r@xmath23 , at which the surface brightness falls to 17x10@xmath24 erg cm@xmath12 s@xmath19 , a sensitivity level met by all the images .",
    "the three measures of the h@xmath0 flux are comparable .",
    "the total flux determined by surface photometry and aperture photometry are the same within a few percent .",
    "the total flux is on the average 10% higher than the flux within r@xmath23 , but with a scatter ( standard deviation ) among galaxies of about 16% .",
    "this is similar to the isolated sample , which has total fluxes about 20% higher than the flux within r@xmath23 , with a 20% scatter .",
    "two virgo galaxies with low surface brightness , ngc 4643 and 4698 , had total fluxes 3 and 9 times , respectively , higher than the flux to r@xmath23 .",
    "finally , the h@xmath0 flux within 0.3r@xmath25 and h@xmath0 concentration ( section  [ haconc ] ) were measured .",
    "table  [ hatab ] presents quantities derived from the h@xmath0 surface photometry .",
    "_      an isophotal radius is one type of radial normalizer .",
    "another radial normalizer which suffers less from intrinsic surface brightness variations between galaxies is the exponential disk scalelength .",
    "the derivation of disk scalelengths is less subject to sky background problems and small frame size than derivation of isophotal radii , since the whole radial range of the light profile is used .",
    "however , the measurement of a disk scalelength is more complicated than that of a simple isophotal radius , because it is usually derived by non - linear fitting of an exponential function to the radial profile .",
    "fitting bulge and disk models to radial profiles is a tricky task , subject to the form of the models chosen , uncertainties due to the projection of a three - dimensional distribution into the sky , seeing corrections , contamination of the profiles by star forming regions , bars , rings , dust ( e.g. , giovanelli et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 ) , and uncertainties in the background values .",
    "the greatest uncertainties are in fitting a proper bulge , especially given the discussion over exponential vs. devaucouleurs laws ( see kormendy 1992 , courteau et al .",
    "1996 , de jong 1996a ) . in order to derive a disk scalelength",
    ", we fit traditional r@xmath26 bulge and exponential disk models to the profiles , using the iraf / stsdas non - linear fitting task , _ nfit1d .",
    "we warn that extreme care must be used in applying this task , since it is very sensitive to complexities in the radial profile . the task attempts to compensate for deviations from a pure bulge + disk profile by overestimating the contribution of the bulge and/or by overemphasizing the inner disk fit compared to the outer disk fit .",
    "we report only the disk scalelength because of the 4 parameters that varied in the bulge - disk decompositions , we find that this parameter is the most stable .",
    "( this was also noted by de jong 1996b , who find that r@xmath27 is more stable than the central disk surface brightness . )",
    "even so , different authors often derive different scalelengths , so we attempted to test the full range of possible disk scalelengths by fitting different radial ranges with different assumptions for the central component . among isolated galaxies ( koopmann & kenney 2001a ) and most of the virgo cluster sample ,",
    "the disk scalelength typically varies by 10 - 15% for the different fits .",
    "the central disk surface brightnesses are more dependent on the assumed form of the central component .",
    "the disk scalelength and estimate of uncertainty in arcseconds appear in columns ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) of table [ hatab ] .",
    "disk scalelengths could not be fit to two virgo cluster galaxies ( ngc 4383 , ngc 4586 ) .",
    "the virgo sample has a higher proportion of complex profiles : 20% ( 11/53 ) of virgo cluster galaxies have derived disk scalelengths which are uncertain by @xmath7 20% , compared to 0% ( 0/27 ) of the isolated sample galaxies ( koopmann & kenney 2001a ) . _",
    "if the surface brightness of disks were self - similar and all disks were exponential with measurable scalelengths , r@xmath25 would be perfectly correlated with r@xmath27 .",
    "we find that the correlation between these two quantities is good , with a measured ratio of r@xmath25/r@xmath27 of 3.23@xmath280.72 for the virgo cluster , compared to 3.16 @xmath28 0.56 for the sample of isolated galaxies ( koopmann & kenney 2001a ) .",
    "these values are similar to that found by giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "given the systematic effects of differing surface brightnesses on isophotal radii and the difficulties of model fitting and unknown extinction values on disk scalelength , it is not obvious which radial normalizer is a better indicator of galaxy / disk size .",
    "we compared results based on both normalizers , but found that our main conclusions are independent of the normalizer .",
    "because more galaxies could be included in the analysis and because of the more uncertain nature of disk scalelength fitting , we chose to normalize by r@xmath25 .      because of the subjectivity of the hubble classification and the difficulty in deriving model - independent bulge - to - disk ( b / d ) ratios ( section  [ diskscale ] )",
    ", we also measured a central r light concentration index .",
    "central light concentration parameters are objective tracers of the radial light distribution of a galaxy ( e.g. , morgan 1958 ; devaucouleurs 1977 ; okamura et 1984 ; kent 1985 ; abraham et al .",
    "1994 , koopmann & kenney 1998 ) .",
    "concentration parameters are correlated to b / d or bulge - to - total light ratio ( devaucouleurs 1977 ; okamura et 1984 ; kent 1985 ; eder 1990 , but see naim et al .",

    "1994 , smail et al .",
    "1997 , van den bergh 1997 ) and they are somewhat dependent on a galaxy s surface brightness ( e.g. , abraham et al .",
    "unlike b / d , concentration parameters are independent of models assumed for galaxy components .",
    "we define a central r light concentration parameter similar to abraham et al .",

    "the c30 values are computed directly from the surface photometry .",
    "we find no correlations between c30 and total r magnitude within r@xmath25 , inclination of the galaxy , or angular distance from m87 .",
    "there is a mild dependence on surface brightness , which causes higher surface brightness galaxies to have a higher c30 .",
    "c30 can be approximately translated to b / d using the following mean [ c30,b / d ] pairs : [ 0.3,0.1 ] , [ 0.4,0.3 ] , [ 0.5,0.8 ] , [ 0.6,1.0 ] .",
    "these numbers are meant to only suggest a rough scale for c30 , particularly since the scatter of these numbers is at least @xmath280.1 , due to uncertainties in the determination of both c30 and b / d .",
    "the correlation between central light concentration and hubble type is discussed in koopmann & kenney ( 1998 , 2001b ) .      in order to compare the concentrations of r and h@xmath0 light",

    "this quantity is listed in column 7 of table  [ hatab ] .",
    "a ch@xmath0 of 1 thus indicates that all of the h@xmath0 emission is located within 0.3r@xmath25 .    to compare the relative distributions of r and h@xmath0 light , we normalize ch@xmath0 by c30 : @xmath32 . for example",

    "we call these galaxies st ( spirals with severely truncated star - forming disks ) , since they do not fit the standard hubble classification criteria ( see koopmann & kenney 1998 ) .",
    "st galaxies are extreme examples of what van den bergh et al .",

    "the more general virgo - type morphology is due to the truncation of the star - forming disk in cluster galaxies , which is the primary cause of the reduction in star formation rates ( kennicutt 1983 ) in virgo cluster galaxies ( koopmann & kenney 2001b ) .",
