    "cantilevers of micrometer size are nowadays present in many applications , ranging from chemical and biological sensors@xcite to scanning probe microscopy@xcite . in many cases , these tiny mechanical systems operate in a fluid environment ( air or water for instance ) which has a great influence on their dynamical behavior : the viscosity of the medium will broaden the structural resonances while the added mass due to the fluid moving along with the cantilever will shift their frequencies .",
    "a few theoretical models have been proposed to account for these effects @xcite , and validated experimentally @xcite . among the prediction of these approaches ,",
    "the power spectrum of thermal noise induced fluctuations is of particular interest for its applications in atomic force microscopy ( afm ) or micro - electromechanical systems ( mems ) .",

    "the cantilever is sketched on fig.[fig : cantilever ] .",
    "its length @xmath6 is supposed to be much larger than its width @xmath0 , which itself is much larger than its thickness @xmath1 .",
    "we will limit ourself in this study to the flexural modes of the cantilever : the deformations are supposed to be only perpendicular to its length ( along axis @xmath2 of fig.[fig : cantilever ] ) and uniform across its width .",
    "theses deformation can thus be described by the deflection @xmath5 , @xmath4 being the spacial coordinate along the beam normalized by @xmath6 , and @xmath3 the time .",

    "when the cantilever is moving inside a fluid , the force acting on the cantilever can be decomposed into 2 components : the force corresponding to the hydrodynamic load @xmath32 due to the motion of the beam in the fluid , and the actual external driving @xmath33 .",
    "following sader s approach @xcite , the hydrodynamic load can be approximated by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the hydrodynamic function corresponding to the rectangular cantilever beam and @xmath36 the density of the fluid .",
    "the real part @xmath37 of @xmath38 corresponds to the added mass due the fluid moving along with the cantilever during its motion ( normalized to @xmath39 , the mass of a cylinder of fluid of diameter @xmath0 and length @xmath6 ) , and the imaginary part @xmath40 to the viscous drag . to solve the equation of motion of the cantilever in the fluid ,",
    "let us decompose the deflection @xmath41 and external driving @xmath33 on the orthonormal basis of the normal modes @xmath42 : @xmath43 we note here that this decomposition is also valid in the real time space , with amplitude @xmath44 and external driving @xmath45 of each mode simply being the inverse fourier transform of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "these 2 variables are coupled by the hamiltonian @xmath48 of the system .",
    "indeed , let us compute the infinitesimal work @xmath49 of @xmath50 when the deflection changes by @xmath51 : @xmath52 for a reversible transformation , we can write @xmath53 , hence @xmath54 this last equation shows that the amplitude @xmath55 and external driving @xmath56 of each mode are coupled variables by the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "we can thus apply the fluctuation dissipation theorem @xcite : the power spectrum density @xmath57 of fluctuation of amplitude for mode @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath61 the temperature of the thermostat and @xmath62 is the imaginary part of its argument .",

    "[ eq : beam fourier ] leads to the following equation for each mode : @xmath63 the amplitude @xmath55 of each mode is thus governed by the equation of motion of an oscillator with stiffness @xmath64 , mass @xmath65 and damping coefficient @xmath66 , forced by external driving @xmath56 . if @xmath35 is a slow varying function of the frequency , close to its resonance each mode behaves like an harmonic oscillator . using the above expression , eq .",
    "[ eq : s_beta_n - fdt ] can be rewritten as @xmath67 with @xmath68 . in general , dissipation couples the modes calculated from the non - dissipative equations , but within the approximation of position independent dissipative forces ( eq  [ eq : f_hydro ] ) , the noises are uncorrelated",
    ". we can thus write a generic expression of the power spectrum density of the deflection using eq .",
    "[ eq : w = sum beta_n phi_n ] : @xmath69 this last equation is in agreement with the one derived by dorignac et al .",
    "@xcite in a more complex framework .",
    "to test the validity of the above formalism , we measure the thermal noise of a commercial afm cantilever ( budget sensor bs - cont ) with the following nominal geometry : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "the cantilever is made of silicium and is coating - less , thus for theoretical expressions we used the tabulated values of si for the young modulus ( @xmath73 for si@xmath74 , the usual crystalline orientation along the length of afm cantilever ) and density ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the length and width were checked with an optical microscope , and the thickness is inferred from the resonance frequency of the cantilever ( from eq .",
    "[ eq : omega_n ] ) , which eventually leads to @xmath70 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "the measurement is performed with a home made interferometric deflection sensor @xcite , inspired by the original design of schonenberger @xcite with a quadrature phase detection technique @xcite : the interferences between the reference laser beam reflecting on the base of the cantilever and the sensing laser beam on the free end of the cantilever directly gives a calibrated measurement of the deflection @xmath78 , with very high accuracy .",
    "we illustrate in fig.[fig : measurement ] the performance of our detection with the power spectrum density ( psd ) of a rigid mirror ( in black ) : the background noise of our system is as low as @xmath79 , just @xmath80 higher than the shot noise limit of our detection system .",
    "typical noise of a measurement in a commercial afm would be at least two orders of magnitude higher .     to @xmath81 range .",
    "we clearly see the two first flexural modes of the mechanical beam , well above the background noise of the apparatus acquired on a rigid mirror .",
    "the difference between the measurement and the background noise spectrums gives a full view of the behavior of the thermal fluctuations of the cantilever in this frequency window .",
    "for comparison , the typical noise floor of a well tuned and calibrated commercial afm is plotted : only the resonances could be studied , the remaining part of the spectrum would be useless . ]     and eq .",

    "we plot in fig.[fig : measurement ] the psd of thermal noise driven deflection at the free end of the cantilever ( in green ) . we clearly see in this spectrum the two first modes of oscillation of the mechanical beam , around @xmath82 and @xmath83 , but we also have a lot of information out of these resonances as the measurement is always above the background noise of the system .",
    "if we subtract this background noise spectrum from the measurement ( blue curve ) , we have an estimation of the thermal noise of the system on the whole @xmath84 to @xmath81 frequency interval , which we can compare to the theoretical expectation of the model presented in the previous section",
    ". the same measurement in a commercial afm would yield much less information , as it would be limited to the resonances , and we would not have any information between them or at low frequency .    in fig.[fig :",

    "20 , 21a and 21b of ref .",
    "@xcite , as it correspond to the first two resonances and the extension to higher order modes of ref .",
    "@xcite is not necessary .",
    "the first model ( fig.[fig : model](a ) ) corresponds to eq .",
    "29a of the original article of sader @xcite , where the frequency dependence of the thermal noise forcing as been omitted .",
    "both resonances are really well described with this model , but the off - resonance behavior is not : the low frequency noise measured is not flat as expected by the model , which also slightly underestimates the noise the intermediate region .",
    "the second model ( fig.[fig : model](b ) ) corresponds to eq .",
    "17a of ref .",
    "@xcite , a corrected expression of the thermal noise proposed by green and sader ( see ref .",
    "44 of @xcite ) to account for frequency dependance of the dissipation following the approach of paul and cross @xcite .",
    "let us first note that this expression is dimensionally incorrect , as it is homogeneous to @xmath85 and not to @xmath86 , so we had to rescale the formula by @xmath87 to match the first resonance .",
    "however , this model perfectly describes the frequency dependance of the first mode , catching the slow variation of the noise in the low frequencies .",
    "the behavior of the second mode could also be well described , but it would need a higher rescaling factor .",
    "we came to the conclusion that the scaling factor is mode dependent , and conducted the analysis of the previous part to derive the correct expression .",
    "indeed , it can easily be shown that the frequency behavior of each mode ( eq .  [ eq : s_beta_n ] ) is exactly the same as in ref .",

    "[ eq : s_beta_n ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : psdw ] , and see that we match the whole power spectrum density of fluctuation of deflection : both resonances , low frequency and intermediate region are very well described by the model .",

    ", we used the sader approach to describe the effect of the surrounding fluid ( added mass and viscous drag ) . using the fluctuation dissipation theorem for each flexural modes of the system",
    ", we derived a general expression for the power spectrum density of fluctuations as the sum of the contribution of the different modes .",
    "this prediction has been compared with an experimental measurement on a commercial afm cantilever in a frequency range covering the 2 first resonances .",
    "a very good agreement has been found on the whole spectrum , with no adjustable parameters but the thickness of the cantilever .",
    "this analysis can be very useful in the afm area , where the thermal motion of the cantilever is of great practical importance ( as a lower bound to measurable forces or as a mechanical driving on its own ) : it is not limited to a fit of resonances only , but gives an _ a priori _ knowledge of the cantilever noise on the whole frequency spectrum .",
