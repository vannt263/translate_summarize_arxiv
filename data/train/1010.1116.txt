    "optimal control of molecular alignment is crucial for applications of liquid crystal films . thus far ,",
    "many sophisticated techniques have been developed for obtaining homogeneous alignment in a desired direction : mechanical rubbing treatment @xcite , surface - polarization effect @xcite , surface coating @xcite and photoalignment @xcite are only a few examples to mention . when employing these techniques ,",
    "topological defects are regarded as unwanted matters and thus they are eliminated artificially . under certain conditions , however , topological defects can have beneficial effects on the alignment control of liquid crystal molecules @xcite as well as of guest particles embedded in a liquid crystal medium @xcite .",
    "the positive effects result largely from topological constraints for the molecular orientational field ( @xmath3 director field ) that is confined in a closed curved substrate .",
    "in fact , the director field over closed curved surfaces strongly depend on the positions and charges of topological defects distributed on the surfaces , which implies the controllability of the director field through the defect manipulation .",
    "such the utilities of topological defects may be enhanced when combined with the geometric potential effect .",
    "it is known that topological defects in curved liquid crystal films experience a surface - curvature - induced potential , attractive or repulsive depending on the local geometry of the surface @xcite .",
    "therefore , a better understanding of the correlation between curvature variation of the underlying surface and favourable configurations of topological defects will shed new light on molecular alignment control of liquid crystal films .",
    "a gaussian bump is one of the exemplary curved surfaces for studying the correlation mentioned above .",
    "it has a continuous rotation symmetry around a vertical axis , showing a positive ( negative ) gaussian curvature close to ( far from ) the top of the bump [ see fig . [",
    "fig : geometry](a ) ] .",
    "the coexistence of a positively curved region and a negatively one on the same surface allows a simultaneous observation of the curvature effects at the two distinct regions with oppositely - signed gaussian curvature .",
    "earlier work suggested that when a nematic liquid crystal film is placed on a gaussian bump , a point disclination with @xmath4 charge is trapped to the top of the bump due to the curvature potential @xcite .",
    "contrariwise , we have found in the previous work that point disclinations are attracted to the inflection point of the bump regardless of their charges @xcite .",
    "these two results appear controversial ; a possible clue to resolve the controversy is the difference in the assumed bump widths between the two existing studies . in the former study ,",
    "the bump width is sufficiently small , so that the bump is covered almost entirely by a single disclination as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry](c ) .",
    "this situation is expressed by saying that the coherence length @xcite , @xmath5 , of the nematic order fluctuation exceeds the scale of the bump width ( see  [ sec : method ] for the definition of @xmath5 ) .",
    "in contrast , the latter study was based on the assumption that the bump width is larger enough than the coherence length and the system can involve many small disclinations [ see fig . [",
    "fig : geometry](b ) ] .",
    "it is thus reasonable to conjecture that the ratio of the bump width to the coherence length plays a decisive role in determining the stable position of disclinations on a gaussian bump .",
    "furthermore , the two contrasting results imply the existence of a threshold ratio across which the stable position of disclinations alters .    in the present letter",
    ", we prove our conjecture by showing a sudden shift in the stable position of a @xmath4 disclination with increasing the bump width .",
    "once the bump width exceeds a threshold value , the stable position is suddenly switched from the top to the inflection point of the bump .",
    "the positional shift is described by a power law function of the bump width , as is analogous to the second - order phase transitions of various physical systems whose properties are characterized by power - law behaviors .",
    "the present result thus indicates a novel kind of phase transition that is peculiar to curved nematic films .",
    "( a ) sketch of a gaussian bump characterized by the width @xmath0 and the hight @xmath6 .",
    "the region inside ( outside ) the dashed circle with radius @xmath0 possesses a positive ( negative ) gaussian curvature .",
    "( b , c ) disclination embedded in the gaussian bump .",
    "the coherence length @xmath5 of the nematic order fluctuation measures the spatial extent of desclinations ( hatched regions ) in which the director field @xmath7 is arranged in a radial manner . ]",
    "we consider point disclinations in a nematic liquid crystal membrane having a gaussian bump geometry .",
    "the bump is described by a position vector @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are right - handed orthogonal basis vectors [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry](a ) ] .",
    "the constant @xmath0 , which we call the bump width , determines the inflection point of the bump at which @xmath12 .",
    "a dimensionless parameter @xmath13 quantifies the convexity of the bump ; @xmath14 for the flat plane , and @xmath15 for a spiky bump .",
    "we fix @xmath16 throughout the paper , as a result of which spatial variation of the surface curvature is smooth and sufficiently slight to be accessible in experiments .    our aim is to evaluate the stable position of a disclination constrained on the gaussian bump . it is solved by calculating the elastic free energy @xmath17 of the director field @xmath18 around the disclination core , since @xmath17 takes a minimum at the stable position to be evaluated .",
    "we assign the core of a @xmath4 disclination at @xmath19 with arbitrary @xmath20 , and assume that the disclination is endowed with the coherence length @xmath5 of the nematic order fluctuation .",
    "the latter assumption ensures a radial pattern of @xmath7 within a circular region @xmath21 having the radius @xmath5 centered at the core [ i.e. , the hatched regions depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : geometry](b ) and [ fig : geometry](c ) ] . slightly deviates from an exact circle due to the finite curvature of the surface .",
    "in fact , we define the perimeter of @xmath21 by the locus of points whose distances from the core are equal to @xmath5 in the sense of geodesic distance .",
    "therefore , the perimeter is distorted a bit from the exact circle . ] the radial pattern of @xmath7 is gradually distorted with increasing distance from the core ; in fact , two - point correlation in the director orientation disappears if the points are well separated by a distance larger than @xmath5 .",
    "a typical value of @xmath5 is on the order of tens micrometers as can be estimated from polarization microscope images of liquid crystal films @xcite .",
    "the continuum elastic theory states that @xmath17 associated with the disclination reads as @xcite @xmath22 \\right\\ } \\mbox { , } \\label{eq : energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a vector operator whose components @xmath24 are the covariant derivative @xcite on the curved surface .",
    "the constant @xmath25 is the thickness of the liquid crystal film ; @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the elastic constants associated with splay , bend and saddle - splay distortions of the field @xmath29 , respectively @xcite . the integration range in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) is restricted to the finite circular region @xmath21 , despite of slow decay in the elastic energy density with distance from the core ; we will revisit this issue in ",
    "[ sec : discussions ] . to avoid the divergence in @xmath17 at the core , we introduce an inner cut - off @xmath30 around the core according to the formula @xmath31 , in which @xmath32 is the nematic - isotropic transition temperature and @xmath33 is the temperature of the system @xcite .    in actual calculations , we set @xmath34 and @xmath35 by referring to the experimental observation @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are those of 4-methoxybenzylidene-4@xmath36-butylaniline ( mbba ) : @xmath37 pn , @xmath38 pn at room temperature @xcite .",
    "since the corresponding value of @xmath28 was not yet measured , we set @xmath39 pn on the basis of the relation @xmath40 that involves the twist coefficient @xmath41 pn for mbba @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : energyplot](a ) shows the disclination energy @xmath17 as a function of the core position @xmath42 .",
    "the normalized bump width , @xmath43 , ranges from @xmath44 to @xmath45 . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the curve of @xmath17 is convex downward , showing a minimum at @xmath47 .",
    "the energy scale of the potential depth corresponds to @xmath48 at a temperature of @xmath49 , which is by far larger than the thermal excitation energy at room temperature .",
    "hence , this downward peak implies that a disclination is trapped to the annulus region having the radius of @xmath50 surrounding the bump top [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : halocon](a ) ] .",
    "we call this annular distribution of disclinations by the halo  phase , according to the discussion in ref . @xcite .",
    "what deserves attention is the @xmath0-driven transition of the downward peak profile .",
    "it follows from fig .",
    "[ fig : energyplot](a ) that both the position and magnitude of the peak are insensitive to the decrease in @xmath43 until it reaches a specific value of @xmath51 .",
    "a drastic change takes place at @xmath51 ; the downward peak in @xmath17 is replaced by a plateau that extends from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "this plateau means that the disclination can move freely within a finite circular region centered at the bump top .",
    "it is also found that a further decrease in @xmath43 gives rise to a new downward peak in @xmath17 at @xmath52 .",
    "that is , when the bump width @xmath0 is comparable to ( or smaller than ) the coherence length @xmath5 , then the disclination is trapped at the bump top [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : halocon](b ) ] ; this result is in complete agreement with the earlier observation @xcite .",
    "we call this defect configuration by the convergence  phase .",
    "we have seen that the peak of @xmath17 appearing at @xmath54 is gradually shifted from the inflection point @xmath55 to the top ( @xmath56 ) of the bump with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows the @xmath0-dependence of the normalized peak position @xmath57 . for a large bump width ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath17 takes the minimum at @xmath59 implying the halo phase . the disclination halo shrinks with decreasing @xmath0 , and",
    "finally it converges at the bump top when @xmath60 .",
    "these results indicate the continuous phase transition ( i.e. , of the second order ) of the stable disclination configuration on the gaussian bump ; the system undergoes the transition from the halo phase to the convergence phase across the threshold @xmath61 .",
    "this is the main finding of the present letter .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath62 in the halo phase is described by a power law of the form @xmath63 the inset of fig .",
    "2(b ) evidences the power - law behavior of eq .",
    "( [ eq_shima ] ) with the exponent @xmath64 , which holds over the two orders of the lateral axis .",
    "we thus believe that the present result is a precursor of an untouched configurational phase transition peculiar to curved liquid crystal systems , though further studies are needed to establish its universality and physical interpretation .",
    "the transition of the stable defect configuration we have demonstrated is a consequence of the following two @xmath17 variations caused by reducing @xmath0 : a slight @xmath17-increase to the right of the arrow @xmath65 marked in fig .",
    "2(a ) , and a rapid @xmath17-decrease to the left of @xmath65 .",
    "in this section , we give an outline of the physical mechanisms of the two @xmath17 variations , while a detailed formulation that describes them will be given elsewhere .    the rapid decrease in @xmath17 to the left of @xmath65 originates from a suppression of the splay deformation of the director field @xmath66 around the bump top .",
    "suppose that a @xmath4 disclination is placed near the top of a broad bump as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry](c ) . since @xmath5 and @xmath67",
    "are constants , a reduction in @xmath0 leads to a lowering of the bump hight @xmath6 remaining the disclination area @xmath21 be fixed . as a result , the disclination is allowed to cover the whole bump . in the latter situation ,",
    "adjacent directors ( thick line segments in the plots ) distributed close to the outer edge of @xmath21 tend to be parallel to each other . eventually , the first integrated term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) , @xmath68 , which represents the contribution from the splay deformation of @xmath69 , is suppressed by reducing @xmath0 .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath17 at @xmath70 drops off when @xmath0 decreases .    a parallel argument to the above accounts for the slight increase in @xmath17 to the right of @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyplot](a ) .",
    "suppose a @xmath4 disclination on the skirt ( i.e. , at @xmath71 ) of the bump .",
    "if the disclination area @xmath21 intersects the circle @xmath72 around the bump top , then it covers a positively - curved region ( @xmath73 ) and a negatively - curved one ( @xmath74 ) . at the negatively curved region , a reduction in @xmath0 yields an enhancement of the splay deformation which leads to the slight increase in @xmath17 at @xmath75 .",
    "a mathematical proof of the splay enhancement has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the data shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : energyplot](a ) and [ fig : energyplot](b ) are derived from a specific gaussian bump shape characterized by the parameter @xmath76 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry](a ) ) .",
    "we also confirmed that , when @xmath77 , the system exhibits the same configurational transition across @xmath1 .",
    "a slight increase in @xmath1 with @xmath78 was observed within the range of @xmath78 , reflecting further splay suppressions and enhancements in disclinations whose cores locate at @xmath52 and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the value of @xmath80 is insensitive to the change in @xmath78 .",
    "it should be stated that our discussion is based on the model given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) , in which contributions from the outer region than the circle @xmath21 are ignored . in actual nematic layers ,",
    "a @xmath4 disclination has a profile of the elastic energy density that decays logarithmically with distance from the core .",
    "hence , contributions far from the core may be relevant to the stable position of the disclination , thus should be taken in account in order to obtain a quantitatively accurate value of @xmath1 . the geometric potential approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite will be a clue to solve this issue .    before closing the letter , we suggest the following system could allow experimental tests of our theoretical predictions ; it is a thin liquid crystal film coating a randomly corrugated substrate .",
    "the film involves many disclinations and bumps with various sizes ; therefore , we will observe simultaneously the two effects , halo and convergence patterns depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : halocon ] , by tuning the surface corrugation .",
    "we also mention that such the corrugated substrate can be synthesized by polymer adhesion with patterned surfaces as demonstrated in ref . @xcite .",
    "we have found a continuous transition of defect configurations in nematic films confined on a gaussian bump .",
    "depending on the ratio @xmath43 , the system exhibits either of two defect distribution patterns : the halo phase ( @xmath81 ) and convergence phase ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the stable position @xmath62 of defects turned out to obey the power law @xmath83 with the exponent @xmath64 under the present condition .",
