    "a considerable amount of experimental and theoretical research has recently been consecrated to the study of the structural and electronic properties of the oxygen deficient ( or cuo@xmath3 ) planes of superconductors of the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2-type .",
    "it has been known for some time that these planes play an important role in the superconductivity of the ybco compounds by regulating the hole concentration in the cuo@xmath0 planes@xcite .",
    "there is now evidence that they also have an interesting physics of their own @xcite .",
    "the basic components of the cuo@xmath3 planes are cu@xmath4o@xmath5 chain fragments in which cu and o atoms form a linear alternating chain . under stoichiometric conditions , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "all chains are ( ideally ) infinitely long . away from stoichiometry",
    "the length of the chains follows a certain distribution determined by @xmath8 and the temperature but the physical properties of the chain planes are dominated by the longest chain fragments@xcite .",
    "band structure calculations@xcite for yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath9 show that the dispersion of the chain - derived bands which cross the fermi level in the directions perpendicular to the chains is much weaker than that in the direction of the chains .",
    "this suggests that , to a first approximation , the latter may be viewed as decoupled from each other and from the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "if this is correct , important @xmath10 fluctuation effects are expected in the charge and spin excitation spectra of the cuo@xmath3 planes .",
    "a recent inelastic neutron scattering study@xcite of a yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath11 crystal shows that such effects are indeed visible in the phonon spectrum of the chain planes .",
    "their signature is the presence of purely inelastic satellites around the structural bragg peaks at positions that correspond closely to the value of @xmath12 for the one - dimensional chains predicted by the band structure calculations@xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the spin fluctuation spectrum of long cu@xmath4o@xmath5 chains in the framework of a one - dimensional model of strongly interacting fermions .",
    "most of the paper deals with the @xmath13 case but we briefly discuss the extension of our calculations to finite temperatures in the concluding section .",
    "our main results are the following .",
    "the spin - spin correlation function of the chains is given by the convolution of two functions .",
    "one is the dynamic structure factor of a one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet on a fictitious lattice that contains a number of sites equal to the total number of holes in the chain .",
    "this factor describes the part of the dynamic that results from the exchange interactions between the spins in the chain .",
    "the second factor , related to the density - density correlation function of the itinerant oxygen holes , takes into account the perturbation of the spin configurations that arise from the motion of the latter .",
    "the magnetic intensity is modulated along the direction of the chains @xcite and is peaked at an incommensurate position , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the nominal oxygen hole concentration in the chains ( see below ) .",
    "the lineshape of the energy - integrated peak , very asymmetric , is quite different from that obtained for a one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "the intensity at @xmath16 is distributed over an energy range given by the fermi energy of the holes . however",
    ", enough intensity remains at low energies that observation of these excitations by inelastic neutron scattering might be feasible .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "the model used to describe the cu - o chains is presented in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the calculation of the ground state spin - spin correlation function is described in [ sec : corr ] . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss our results and their connection with experiment .",
    "the simplest microscopic model for the cu - o chains is the @xmath10 emery hamiltonian@xcite defined by :    @xmath17    here , @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the o and cu sites , respectively , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are annihilation operators for holes of spin @xmath22 on cu and o sites , the occupation number of a hole with spin @xmath22 is @xmath23 and @xmath24 . hopping is only allowed between nearest neighbors .",
    "the values of the charge transfer gap and of the on - site coulomb repulsion appropriate for the description of the cuo chains are@xcite @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the cu - o transfer integral . in the following we shall measure energies from the position of the cu level and set @xmath28 .",
    "an additional parameter , the charge of the fragment , has to be fixed in order to completely define the problem . taking the cu@xmath29 and o@xmath30 configurations as reference states",
    ", one may easily see@xcite that a neutral fragment with @xmath31 cu atoms contains @xmath32 holes .",
    "however , because of the transfer of charge between the cuo@xmath3 and the cuo@xmath0 planes the number of holes in the chains , @xmath33 with @xmath34 , deviates from this value@xcite . in a naive picture",
    "in which all the cu ions in the chain are in the cu@xmath35 state , @xmath15 is simply the concentration of oxygen holes .",
    "it is experimentally known @xcite that the hole concentration in long chain fragments is @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , for the systems discussed here , @xmath37 .",
    "it is however interesting to treat @xmath15 as a free parameter and study the dependence on concentration of different physical quantities .",
    "the emery hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ 1 ] gives a good a description of the static electronic properties of the chain fragments@xcite but it can only be properly treated with numerical methods such as quantum monte carlo or exact diagonalization that are not well suited for the calculation of the dynamic susceptibility .",
    "there is a limiting case , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 finite but large , in which a more tractable model@xcite can be derived from eq .",
    "[ 1 ] . in this limit",
    "the cu occupation @xmath41 is unity and charge fluctuations on the cu sites only appear in virtual processes generated in perturbation theory by the kinetic energy term . in the 2nd order in @xmath42",
    "we generate a process in which an o hole hops from a site @xmath18 to an adjacent o site , @xmath43 leaving the spin _ sequence _ in the lattice unchanged@xcite .",
    "this process , whose amplitude is @xmath44 , is described by a tight - binding model for _ spinless _ free fermions defined on the oxygen sublattice :    @xmath45    in the same order in @xmath42 there is an exchange interaction between a spin on an oxygen site and the spins on neighboring cu sites with coupling @xmath46 .",
    "finally , if there is no o hole on a site @xmath18 the cu spins on sites @xmath47 still interact antiferromagnetically with a coupling constant that is of the fourth - order in @xmath42 , @xmath48 .",
    "the spin part of the interaction is thus described by a @xmath10 heisenberg hamiltonian given by :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the number of oxygen holes in the system , @xmath51 is the total number of spins in the system and @xmath52 are spin 1/2 operators .",
    "the nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath53 or @xmath54 depending on whether @xmath55 is a cu - o or a cu - cu pair , respectively .    since the couplings @xmath56 depend upon the instantaneous hole distribution , the spin and charge degrees of freedom of the system are coupled and the total hamiltonian is not exactly solvable in general",
    ". however , in the special case @xmath57 an exact solution can be found .",
    "this is because if the exchange coupling is the same for all pairs of spins regardless of the charge configuration , the hamiltonian becomes the sum of two independent terms each of which is exactly solvable .",
    "in the case of the cu - o chains the ratio of couplings @xmath58 is not unity but , as shown elsewhere@xcite , their _ static _",
    "magnetic correlations are quite accurately described by an effective homogeneous model .",
    "it seems therefore natural to try and use it to compute the time - dependent correlation functions as well .",
    "this is the approach that we follow in this paper .",
    "the appropriate parametrization of the effective model may be determined variationally .",
    "if we construct a trial ground - state wave function as the product of separate wavefunctions for the spins and for the holes and then determine the individual components by minimizing the total energy of the system , we obtain the effective model    @xmath59    where @xmath60 and we have omitted an energy shift that can be absorbed in a redefinition of the chemical potential of the holes .",
    "we find @xmath61 for @xmath62 .    in spite of the simple form of @xmath63 the spin - spin correlation function ,    @xmath64    is non - trivial because the relationship between @xmath65 and @xmath66 is not simple@xcite .",
    "the difference between the coordinates of a spin measured in the real and in the fictitious lattices is determined by the number of holes located to its left . in terms of @xmath67 , the fourier transform of the spins on the fictitious lattice",
