    "general relativity in spacetime dimension @xmath3 larger than four supports black brane solutions that , unlike in lower dimensions , are not uniquely characterized by their asymptotic charges ( mass , spin , gauge charges ) .",
    "an example of this situation is the kaluza - klein black hole , a solution of the einstein equations consisting of a black hole embedded in a compactified spacetime , for instance @xmath4 . because of the lack of uniqueness in @xmath5 , this system exhibits a range of phases , characterized by the horizon topology , as the period @xmath6 of the @xmath7 is varied . for @xmath6",
    "much larger than the horizon length scale , the horizon topology is @xmath8 corresponding to an isolated black hole . as @xmath6 becomes of order @xmath9 one finds uniform and non - uniform black string phases with horizon topology @xmath10 .",
    "there is evidence to support the conjecture that uniform string decays  @xcite proceed via a topology changing phase transition into a black hole final state ( see  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "other proposals for the final state of the unstable black string can be found in  @xcite .",
    "understanding the dynamics of the black hole / black string phase transition is important for a variety of reasons .",
    "apart from being a toy model for studying the physics of topology change in higher dimensional general relativity , it is also relevant for its connection to gauge / gravity duality in string theory  @xcite .",
    "also , the kaluza - klein black hole plays a role in the phenomenology of scenarios where gravity is strong at the tev scale , and production of higher dimensional black holes at the lhc becomes a possibility",
    ".    there does not exist an analytic solution of the einstein equations describing a black hole in the background @xmath0 with @xmath11 ( however , see  @xcite ; for @xmath12 , a closed form metric can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for generic values of the ratio @xmath13 one must resort to numerical simulations in order to find solutions .",
    "these have been carried out in  @xcite . here",
    ", we will consider the asymptotic region of the phase diagram in which the parameter @xmath14 is much less than unity , and analytic solutions can be found perturbatively .",
    "although this region of parameter space is likely to be far from where the black hole / black string transition is expected to take place , it is a region that can be mapped out analytically .",
    "these perturbative calculations provide a useful test of the numerical simulations , and by extrapolation , may give qualitative information on the full phase diagram of solutions .",
    "the @xmath1 corrections to the thermodynamics of a small black hole in the background @xmath4 have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite to leading order for arbitrary @xmath3 , and in ref .",
    "@xcite to order @xmath2 for @xmath15 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the order @xmath1 corrections were calculated by employing a specialized coordinate system  @xcite for the entire spacetime .",
    "alternatively , the approach taken in  @xcite is to split the spacetime into a region near the black hole where the solution is the @xmath3-schwarzschild metric , @xmath16 weakly perturbed by compactification , and a far region in which the metric can be parametrized in terms of asymptotic multipole moments ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a systematic discussion of this procedure ) .",
    "these two solutions are then patched together in an overlap region , yielding a relation between the short distance parameters ( the scale @xmath9 of the @xmath3-dimensional schwarzschild metric ) and the mass @xmath17 and tension @xmath18 as measured by an observer far from the black hole .",
    "this behavior can be traced to the short distance singularities of the @xmath3-dimensional flat space green s function .",
    "a prescription for handling such divergences at leading order in @xmath1 can be found in  @xcite . ] . as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "all thermodynamic quantities relevant to the phase diagram can be calculated given the asymptotic  charges \" @xmath19 .    here",
    ", we propose a different method for calculating the phase diagram in the perturbative region @xmath20 , based on the effective field theory approach applied to extended gravitational systems developed in  @xcite .",
    "since in the @xmath20 limit there is a large hierarchy between the short distance scale @xmath9 and the compactification size , it is natural to integrate out ultraviolet modes at distances shorter than @xmath9 to obtain an effective lagrangian describing the dynamics of the relevant degrees of freedom at the scale @xmath6 . in the resulting eft , the scale @xmath9 only appears in the wilson coefficients of operators in the action constructed from the relevant modes . ignoring horizon absorption  @xcite and spin  @xcite ,",
    "these long wavelength modes are simply the metric tensor @xmath21 coupled to the black hole worldline coordinate @xmath22 .",
    "the couplings of the particle worldline to the metric can be obtained by a fairly straightforward matching calculation , although one expects that all operators consistent with symmetries ( diffeomorphism invariance , worldline reparametrizations ) are present .",
    "although clearly there are some similarities between the eft approach and the matched asymptotics of  @xcite , there are several advantages to formulating the @xmath1 expansion in the language of an eft :    * in the eft , it is possible to disentangle the terms in the perturbative expansion that arise from the finite extent of the black hole , which scale like integer powers of @xmath13 , versus  post - newtonian \" corrections due to the non - linear terms in the einstein - hilbert lagrangian that scale like integer powers of @xmath23 and are therefore also equivalent to powers of @xmath1 . *",
    "the eft has manifest power counting in @xmath1 .",
    "this means that it is possible to determine at what order in the expansion effects from the finite size of the black hole horizon first arise . as we will show in the next section , the first finite size correction , which in the eft manifests itself through a non - minimal coupling of the black hole worldline to the riemann tensor arises at order @xmath24 . for a fixed @xmath3 the finite size effects , for example the tidal distortion of the black hole horizon , will contribute to the thermodynamic variables at order @xmath25 relative to the leading order result .",
    "thus the finite horizon effects become as large as @xmath2 as @xmath26 .",
    "this also indicates that the results of refs .",
    "@xcite are not sensitive to the specific structure of the kaluza - klein black hole , but rather reflect the thermodynamics of structureless point particles .",
    "* in the eft , calculations can be carried out using the standard tools of field theoretic perturbation theory . in particular",
    ", the perturbative expansion has a diagrammatic interpretation in terms of standard feynman diagrams .",

    "<S> we study the thermodynamics of small black holes in compactified spacetimes of the form @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this system is analyzed with the aid of an effective field theory ( eft ) formalism in which the structure of the black hole is encoded in the coefficients of operators in an effective worldline lagrangian . in this effective theory </S>",
    "<S> , there is a small parameter @xmath1 that characterizes the corrections to the thermodynamics due to both the non - linear nature of the gravitational action as well as effects arising from the finite size of the black hole . using the power counting of the eft </S>",
    "<S> we show that the series expansion for the thermodynamic variables contains terms that are analytic in @xmath1 , as well as certain fractional powers that can be attributed to finite size operators . </S>",
    "<S> in particular our operator analysis shows that existing analytical results do not probe effects coming from horizon deformation . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , we work out the order @xmath2 corrections to the thermodynamics of small black holes for arbitrary @xmath3 , generalizing the results in the literature . </S>"
