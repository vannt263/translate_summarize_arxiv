    "binaries of compact objects , such as black holes ( bhs ) and/or neutron stars , are one of the main targets for gravitational - wave ( gw ) observations .",
    "when the binary members are widely separated , their slow inspiral can be well - described by the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation , a perturbative _ asymptotic _ expansion of the `` true '' solution of the einstein equations .",
    "the small expansion parameter in the pn approximation is @xmath13 , where @xmath4 is the orbital velocity of the binary and @xmath14 is the speed of light .",
    "asymptotic expansions , however , must be used with care , as the inclusion of higher - order terms does not necessarily lead to an increase in accuracy .",
    "therefore one would like to determine the optimal order of expansion and the formal region of validity of the pn asymptotic series  @xcite , i.e.  the order and region inside which the addition of higher order terms increases the accuracy of the approximation in a convergent fashion .    in a previous paper ( @xcite , henceforth paper i ) ,",
    "two of us investigated the accuracy of the pn approximation for quasicircular , nonspinning ( schwarzschild ) , extreme mass - ratio inspirals ( emris ) . by comparing the pn expansion of the energy flux to numerical calculations in the perturbative teukolsky formalism",
    ", we concluded that ( i ) the region of validity of the pn expansion is largest at relative 3pn order ",
    "i.e. , order @xmath15 ( throughout this paper , a term of @xmath16 is said to be of @xmath17pn order ) ; and ( ii ) the inclusion of higher multipoles in numerical calculations is necessary to improve the agreement with pn expansions at large orbital velocities .",
    "the fact that the region of validity is largest at 3pn could be a hint that the series actually _ diverges _ beyond 3pn order , at least in the extreme mass - ratio limit .",
    "this paper extends our study to emris for which the more massive component is a _ rotating _ ( kerr ) bh .",
    "the present analysis focuses on the effect of the bh spin on the accuracy of the pn expansion .",
    "we generalize the methods presented in paper i to take into account certain pathological behaviors of the _ error function _",
    ", used to determine the region of validity .",
    "this generalization may also be applicable to comparable - mass systems .",
    "a surprising result we find is that the edge of the region of validity ( the maximum velocity beyond which higher - order terms in the series can not be neglected ) , normalized to the velocity at the innermost stable circular orbit , is weakly dependent on the kerr spin parameter @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , this edge is roughly in the range @xmath18 $ ] for almost all pn orders , irrespective of @xmath9 .",
    "this suggests , perhaps , that the ratio @xmath7 is a better pn expansion parameter than @xmath13 , when considering spinning bhs .",
    "another surprising result is related to the behavior of the edge of the region of validity as a function of pn order . in the nonspinning case",
    ", two of us found that beyond 3pn order , @xmath19 , this edge seemed to consistently decrease with pn order  @xcite .",
    "this was studied up to @xmath20 , the largest pn order known for the nonspinning case . in the spinning case , however , the series is known only up to @xmath21 , and we are thus unable to conclusively determine if the trend found in the nonspinning case persists .",
    "higher - order calculations will be necessary to draw more definite conclusions .",
    "numerical ( or in this case , perturbative ) calculations of the energy flux rely on multipolar decompositions of the angular dependence of the radiation . by comparing the convergence of the multipolar decomposition to the convergence of the pn expansion of the energy flux",
    ", we find that for @xmath22 the inclusion of multipoles up to and including @xmath11 seems necessary to achieve the level of accuracy of the best - known ( @xmath12 ) pn expansion of the flux .",
    "these conclusions are also largely independent of the spin parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : flux ]",
    "we present the energy flux radiated by quasicircular , equatorial kerr emris in the adiabatic approximation , as computed in pn theory @xcite and with accurate frequency - domain codes in bh perturbation theory @xcite . in section [ sec : validity ] we discuss the region of validity of the pn approximation in terms of the normalized orbital velocity @xmath7 and of the normalized orbital radius @xmath23 , where isco stands for the innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "we consider both corotating and counterrotating orbits . in section [ sec : multipoles ] we study the number of multipolar components that must be included in the _ numerical _ flux in order to achieve sufficient accuracy .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : concl ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we follow the same notation as in paper i. in particular , from now on we will use geometrical units ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "in the pn approximation , the gw energy flux radiated to infinity by a test particle in a circular orbit and on the equatorial plane of a kerr bh is given by  @xcite [ pnexp ] f^(n)=f_newt . this flux is known up to @xmath12 when including spins , and up to @xmath24 in the nonspinning case .",
    "the leading ( newtonian ) contribution is f_newt = v^10 , where @xmath25 and @xmath0 are the test particle mass and kerr bh mass , respectively .",
    "as we are here interested in the accuracy of the pn approximation , we will ignore the flux of energy going into the horizon , which can not always be neglected when building waveform templates .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 contain both spin - independent and spin - dependent terms , where the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath9 is related to the kerr bh spin angular momentum via @xmath28 .",
    "these coefficients can be found in eq .",
    "( g19 ) of @xcite , so we do not list them explicitly . ] .",
    "note that logarithmic terms only appear at 3pn and 4pn ( i.e. , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) , and that the @xmath31 for @xmath32 are known _ only _ in the spin - independent limit .    throughout this paper @xmath4",
    "is the orbital velocity , defined as @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the small body s orbital frequency ) , and related to the boyer - lindquist radius @xmath5 by [ r - solve ] = , whose inverse is [ kepler ] v = ^-1/3 . at the isco we have @xcite [ risco ] & = & 3+z_2 - , + z_1&&1+(1-a^2)^1/3 , + z_2&&(3a^2+z_1 ^ 2)^1/2 , [ z1z2 ] where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) corresponds to corotating ( counterrotating ) orbits .    using eqs .   and  ( [ risco ] )",
    ", we also have = .",
    "the isco velocity can be found by replacing @xmath37 in eq .   into the velocity - radius relation ( [ kepler ] ) .",
    "the velocity @xmath8 and the radius @xmath38 are displayed graphically in fig .",
    "[ visco ] . observe that , although @xmath39 as @xmath40 , @xmath8 is bounded by @xmath41 .",
    "isco velocity ( @xmath8 , top panel ) and radius ( @xmath38 , bottom panel ) as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "here and elsewhere we use the convention that a negative spin parameter refers to counterrotating orbits.,width=321 ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "until now , we compared the pn approximation to numerical results that were considered to be virtually `` exact '' .",
    "this was justified because the teukolsky code computes as many multipoles in the angular decomposition of the radiation as needed to achieve an accuracy of @xmath42 at any given orbital velocity . while this is manageable in frequency - domain calculations , sometimes accurate calculations of a large number of multipoles are not possible in extreme mass - ratio _ time - domain _ codes , or in numerical relativity simulations of comparable - mass binaries : cf .",
    "@xcite for an analysis of multipolar decompositions of the radiation from comparable - mass binaries and @xcite for more recent numerical work to overcome these difficulties . as advocated in several papers @xcite , emris",
    "provide a simple playground to study the number of multipolar components required to reach a given accuracy in the pn approximation ( or in one of its resummed variants ) .",
    "figure  [ multipoles ] shows a comparison of the convergence of the multipolar decomposition versus the convergence of the pn expansion of the energy flux .",
    "this plot generalizes fig .  7 of paper i in two ways : ( i ) it uses more accurate numerical data , and ( ii ) it considers the effect of the central bh spin on the number of multipolar components required to achieve a given accuracy",
    ".    we fix three values of the orbital velocity ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) and we plot @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the @xmath17th approximant of the pn energy flux and @xmath48 is the numerical energy flux truncated at the @xmath49th angular multipole .",
    "some features are immediately visible from this plot :    * even at low orbital velocities ( @xmath43 ) , it is necessary to include multipolar components up to and including @xmath50 to achieve an accuracy better than @xmath51 in the flux ; on the other hand , including up to @xmath11 we obtain results that are as accurate as those that would be obtained including more multipoles . * for an orbital velocity @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) the best - known pn flux and numerical calculations always disagree at levels of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) or larger .",
    "this is obviously due to the slower , nonmonotonic convergence of the pn approximation in this regime .",
    "some nontrivial features of the pn approximation are again well - visible here : for example , as pointed out repeatedly in this paper , when @xmath54 and @xmath44 the 3pn ( @xmath55 ) expansion performs much better than higher - order expansions .",
    "this may well be accidental , and in fact it does not hold when @xmath45 , as then @xmath56 is ( most likely accidentally ) better . * as a rule of thumb , the inclusion of multipoles up to and including @xmath11 seems necessary to achieve the level of accuracy of the best - known ( @xmath12 ) pn expansion of the flux in the kerr case .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the spin parameter @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , @xmath9 has hardly any effect on the number of multipolar components that must be included in the flux to achieve a desired accuracy .",
    "we extended the method proposed in paper i to determine the formal region of validity of the pn approximation for quasicircular emris of compact objects in the equatorial plane of a kerr bh .",
    "the boundary of the formal region of validity is defined as the orbital velocity where the `` true '' error in the approximation ( relative to high - accuracy numerical calculations ) becomes comparable to the series truncation error ( due to neglecting higher - order terms in the series ) .    for quasicircular , equatorial kerr emris ,",
    "the pn expansion is known up to 4pn , and our estimate of the region of validity can only be pushed up to 3pn .",
    "our main results are shown in fig .",
    "[ conv ] ( in terms of orbital velocity ) and in fig .",
    "[ conr ] ( in terms of orbital radius ) . at fixed but arbitrary spin parameter @xmath9 ,",
    "the 3pn approximation has no obvious advantage when compared with other pn orders . at fixed pn order @xmath17 , fig .",
    "[ conv ] shows an interesting trend : when normalized by the isco velocity @xmath8 , to a very good approximation the region of validity does not depend on @xmath9 .",
    "we should emphasize that our results say nothing about the absolute accuracy of the pn approximation : they only suggest relational statements between the @xmath17th and the @xmath57th - order approximations .",
    "for velocities within the region of validity of the asymptotic series , all we can say is that the @xmath17th order approximation has errors that are of expected relative size . for larger velocities , the @xmath58th- and",
    "higher - order terms become important , and should not be formally neglected . if we can tolerate errors larger than those estimated by the @xmath57th order term ( at the risk that higher - order approximations may be less accurate than lower - order ones ) we can surely use the pn expansion beyond the realm of its formal region of validity .",
    "this , however , would force us to lose analytic control of the magnitude of the error , as given by the next order term .",
    "the meaning of this caveat is well illustrated by the counterrotating case with @xmath54 : it is clear from fig .",
    "[ result ] that the 3.5pn and 4pn approximations do _ not _ represent an improvement over the 3pn approximation ( and in fact perform quite badly ) beyond the realm of the region of validity .    future work could concentrate on studying whether resummation techniques , such as pad  @xcite or chebyshev  @xcite , enlarge the formal region of validity , using the methods developed here .",
    "this would allow us to identify optimal resummation methods , which , in turn , affects resummed waveform models for emris , like the effective - one - body approach  @xcite .",
    "moreover , one could attempt to establish whether there is a correlation between the accuracy of the energy flux , as measured by the asymptotic methods developed here , and the accuracy of the waveform model , as required by gw detectors .",
