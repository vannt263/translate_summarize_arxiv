    "in the last decade , many authors have proposed cosmological models driven by a time dependent vacuum energy density , @xmath5 .",
    "the leitmotiv of such an idea is related to two basic difficulties of the standard @xmath6cdm model ( constant vacuum energy density ) .",
    "one is that a dynamical @xmath7-term may solve the so - called cosmological constant problem because in this case the vacuum energy density relaxes to its present value and one may argue that @xmath6 is small today because the expanding universe is too old .",
    "the other is that a dynamical-@xmath6 may also solve the so - called cosmic coincidence problem , i.e. the fact that the time - varying matter energy density and the ( constant ) vacuum energy density have the same order of magnitude nowadays .",
    "since long ago , many different phenomenological decay laws for @xmath7 were proposed in the literature ( see @xcite for the oldest literature and @xcite for more recent articles ) .",
    "the predictions of the latest models have also been confronted with the available observational data and the results compared with the predictions of the standard @xmath6cdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "there are also some attempts to justify theoretically a  running vacuum \" and the plethora of phenomenological decaying vacuum laws based on different methods , as for instance , the thermal instability of a de sitter spacetime @xcite and the renormalization group technique in curved spacetimes @xcite .",
    "some alternative approaches try to represent the interacting @xmath7 models through a lagrangian description @xcite , by a mixture of a scalar field interacting with the radiation bath @xcite , as in the so - called warm inflationary model @xcite , or still based on the quantum mechanics probability of unstable states @xcite .",
    "recently , a large class of nonsingular models , where the vacuum energy density evolves phenomenologically as a truncated power - series in the hubble parameter , has been proposed @xcite ( its dominant term @xmath8 ) .",
    "this class of models has some interesting features , among them : a new mechanism for inflation with no exit problem which evolves smoothly from a primeval de sitter state to the radiation phase , its late - time cosmic expansion history is very close to the concordance and it also furnishes a smooth link between the initial and final de sitter stages through the radiation and matter dominated phases .",
    "more recently , a comparison with the observations has also been carried out by gomez - valent and sol @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the production of primordial gravitational waves ( gw ) for a particular case of this class of nonsingular models , when @xmath9 behaves like @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the constant bare vacuum energy density , @xmath2 is the hubble parameter and @xmath3 is the primordial inflationary scale . the gw equation is derived and its time - dependent part numerically integrated since the primordial de sitter stage .",
    "as we shall see , for higher frequencies ( @xmath4 khz ) the predicted spectrum departs from the standard inflationary prediction , and , as such , these models are distinguishable if high frequency gravitational wave detectors become operative and reach the expected sensitivity in the near future . in general grounds ,",
    "this signal reinforces the possibility of a new observational approach to inflationary physics , and provides additional motivation in the search for stochastic background of gravitational waves at high frequencies @xcite ) .",
    "it is also argued that similar results remain valid for generic decaying vacuum cosmologies with an initial de sitter stage supported by a power - law @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "0.1 in    let us now consider that the universe is described by a flat friedmann - lemitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) geometry . in the co - moving coordinate system ,",
    "the background line element reads ( @xmath14 ) :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the scale factor and the conformal time , @xmath17 , was used in the last expression .",
    "the einstein equations in the above background read @xmath18 where a dot means time derivative . to solve the above set of equations one needs the functional form of @xmath7 and the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "as remarked before , it will be assumed here that the @xmath9-term is given by a particular case of the general class studied by perico et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also lima and maia @xcite )    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the bare cosmological constant . by assuming that the material medium obeys the eos , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a different constant for each era",
    ", one may show that the scale factor and the hubble parameter obey the following equations ( from now on , without loss of generality we consider @xmath23 ) :    @xmath24- ( 1 + \\omega)\\lambda_{b } = 0 .",
    "\\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the standard cosmic concordance model equations are recovered by taking the limits @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( @xmath6cdm ) . for @xmath2",
    "sufficiently large , the term proportional to @xmath20 can also be neglected .",
    "further , for @xmath27 and @xmath25 the hubble parameter reads : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an integration constant .",
    "we see that the transition from an early de sitter ( @xmath30 ) to the radiation phase ( @xmath31 ) is analytically described . in terms of the conformal time ,",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , ( [ eq9 ] ) become : @xmath32- ( 1 + \\omega)\\lambda_{b } = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where primes denote derivative with respect to @xmath33 . by fixing the eos parameters , the integration constants for each era",
    "are obtained by imposing the continuity conditions for @xmath34 and @xmath35 at the transition times between two subsequent eras .",
    "the classical tensor metric perturbation in the flrw flat metric ( [ eq1 ] ) takes the form :    @xmath36,\\ ] ]    where the perturbation @xmath37 is small , @xmath38 , is transverse - traceless and satisfy the gauge constraints : @xmath39 .",
    "now , by assuming that the vacuum energy - momentum tensor has null tensor perturbations , the first order evolution of @xmath40 is given by @xcite :    @xmath41    whose solution can be fourier expanded in the standard way @xcite : @xmath42 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 are the mode functions , @xmath44 is the comoving wave vector , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are complex numbers , and @xmath47 is the symmetric , transverse - traceless polarization tensor .",
    "now , by recalling that the comoving wave number is given by    @xmath48    and inserting the solution ( [ hij ] ) into ( [ heq ] ) , it is readily seen that the temporal part yield a differential equation valid for both polarizations ( henceforth we drop the index @xmath49 )    @xmath50    where we have introduced the convenient quantity , @xmath51 , whose continuity also guarantees the continuity of the first derivative of the scale factor . by using the auxiliary function , @xmath52",
    ", the above equation assumes the form first derived by grishchuck @xcite : @xmath53 this is the basic equation which allow us to obtain the associated physical quantities like the wave amplitude , energy density and power spectrum .",
    "the scale of the `` grishchuck potential '' , @xmath54 , as compared with the wave - number determines the behavior of the limiting solutions for @xmath55 .",
    "the solutions are oscillatory , @xmath56 , when @xmath57 holds .",
    "the high - frequency modes in this case are diluted by the cosmic expansion since @xmath58 . in the opposite regime",
    "one finds @xmath59 so that the amplitude remains constant . in this case , the damping of the waves due the universe expansion is avoided , a phenomenon usually referred to as _ adiabatic amplification _",
    "@xcite .    in figures",
    "[ fig1]a and",
    "[ fig1]b we show the behavior of the quantities @xmath60 and @xmath61 during the transition from the early de sitter stage to the radiation phase . for the sake of clarity ,",
    "both quantities were expressed in terms of a convenient variable , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the time when @xmath64 is reached . as shown below eq .",
    "( [ eqh ] ) , the value of @xmath65 depends on the scale @xmath3 . in the variable @xmath66 ,",
    "the maximum of @xmath67 for the decaying vacuum model occurs at @xmath68 while for the abrupt case the maximum is delayed ( @xmath69 .",
    "the interesting point here is that such a transition in our model is smooth and can analytically be followed in terms of the scale factor and the quantity @xmath67 .",
    "0.1 in    let us now determine the generated spectrum of the gravitational waves . during the transition from inflation to radiation ( inf - r ) ,",
    "the gw equation ( [ mu ] ) assumes the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 . from section [ section cosmology ]",
    "one finds that the quantity @xmath72 for @xmath27 reads :    @xmath73    where we have at @xmath63 the maximum value @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the conformal time of equality of the energy densities of radiation and matter .",
    "since at early times the spacetime is essentially de sitter , we may choose a solution of the above equation satisfying the _ adiabatic vacuum _ @xmath76 constraint @xcite . using this condition",
    "we find : @xmath77    the above expression for @xmath78 , as well as its derivative @xmath79 , provide the initial conditions for the numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq_mu_inf ] ) .",
    "consequently , the evolution of the gravitational waves can be traced until @xmath75 from which the scale factor and waveforms behave as in the usual @xmath6cdm scenario .",
    "in addition , from the standard definition , we also find the resulting present power spectrum of the relic gws in this model : @xmath80    in figure [ fig2]a we show the present day root - mean - square ( rms ) amplitude of the gravitational waves as a function of the physical frequency @xmath81 for the decaying vacuum model , which is related to the power spectrum via @xmath82 . for comparison",
    ", we also show the rms amplitude for the abrupt three phase transition model ( de sitter , radiation and matter ) with @xmath83 . for simplicity , we have not included a late time @xmath20 dominated epoch since the same effect for both models is obtained , namely , a little smaller value of @xmath84 for the complete gw spectrum . notice the remarkable superposition of both spectra for almost the entire spectral range .",
    "the models are distinguishable only at very high frequencies , which are displayed in detail in figure [ fig2]b , where we show the spectrum of the density parameter @xmath85 . in this figure",
    ", we have fixed the value of @xmath3 for the abrupt transition model and considered some possible values of @xmath3 for the decaying vacuum cosmology .    at high frequencies",
    "the two models predict distinct spectra for a given value of @xmath3 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , such an effect can be understood in terms of the behavior of @xmath86 and @xmath61 .",
    "since the decaying vacuum model evolves smoothly from a de sitter towards a radiation era , the shape of @xmath86 for the transition and the consequent lower value of @xmath87 ( for the same @xmath3 ) result in a lower high frequency gw production .    on the other hand , there is no adiabatic amplification for frequencies @xmath88 so that we have introduced a cut - off at @xmath89 in these graphs . for a given @xmath3 value , the cut - off frequency for the abrupt transition model",
    "is twice the cut - off frequency for the decaying vacuum model .",
    "however , since we have freedom to choose @xmath3 for the @xmath6(h)-model , different cut - off frequencies are allowed ( see fig . [",
    "fig2]b ) . in principle ,",
    "even for different values of @xmath3 , the shape of the curves predicted by the at and st models are quite different thereby suggesting a possible test for the underlying inflationary mechanisms .",
    "we have investigated the production of gravitational waves in the context of a flat nonsingular decaying vacuum cosmology .",
    "the dynamical @xmath6(h)-term was phenomenologically modeled as @xmath90 .",
    "this kind of model undergone a smooth transition from an early inflation to the standard radiation phase which can analytically be described @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the model explain the present day entropy content of the universe stored in the relic radiation @xcite without necessity of a non - adiabatic reheating stage .",
    "such scenario are free of horizon and  graceful exit \" problems , and are also in agreement with the observations at low and intermediate redshifts since it evolves to the standard @xmath20cdm cosmology .",
    "therefore , the scenario provides an interesting framework to compare the production of gravitational waves from an early de sitter phase with the predictions of the standard approach ( inflation plus radiation and subsequent eras ) .",
    "the solutions for the gw equation were numerically obtained .",
    "the result provides a simple and definite example that the details of the transition from the early de sitter to the radiation phase can play an important role in the generation of the gw spectrum .",
    "the identified lower gw production for high frequencies ( @xmath4 khz ) is a remarkable signature of the @xmath6 decay model ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1]b and [ fig2]b ) .",
    "although far exceeding the frequencies ( and sensitivity ) of the existing gw detectors in ground - based experiments and space - based successors like lisa , new kinds of interferometers and detectors operating in a frequency range high enough to test primordial gw have been discussed in the recent literature @xcite ) .",
    "the high frequency behavior shows that the model is not only distinguishable from the abrupt inflationary scenario but can also provide a crucial test for the underlying mechanism as predicted in some multi - field inflationary models ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we stress that the model discussed here is a starting point for the investigation of more complex and rich decaying vacuum cosmologies , like the general class proposed in ref . @xcite .",
    "such models with @xmath91 deserves a closer scrutiny since they furnish a complete cosmological history . in principle , although the details might be dependent on the power @xmath92 , similar results to the ones derived here should be expected because the entire class also evolves through a smooth transition from de sitter to the radiation .",
    "a detailed analysis involving the generation of gravitational waves in this more general framework will be discussed in a forthcoming communication .",
