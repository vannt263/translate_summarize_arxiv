    "ideas are typically required when thermostats are to be included .",
    "nevertheless , several approaches to hamiltonian thermostats have been developed .",
    "here we consider various approaches pioneered by bill ashurst , carl dettmann , denis evans , wm .",
    "g. hoover , tom leete , gary morriss , shuichi nos , and les woodcock over a span of about 25 years@xcite .    the simplest thermostat type maintains a ( nearly ) constant kinetic energy by `` rescaling '' the velocities at the end of each computational timestep . for a more elegant , but equivalent , _ continuous _ approach to rescaling , see the `` gaussian isokinetic '' method described in section iib and illustrated in section vii . for @xmath1",
    "cartesian degrees of freedom the kinetic - theory relation , @xmath2 defines the kinetic temperature @xmath3 .",
    "thermostats based on @xmath3 can be applied to an entire system , or separately to two or more subsystems . with this _ ad hoc _ rescaling approach , @xmath4 there is no difficulty in maintaining several temperatures in specified parts of a single nonequilibrium system , as did ashurst in his ph d thesis research@xcite .    kinetic theory and",
    "the gibbs - boltzmann development of thermodynamics based on ideal - gas thermometry certainly suggest that the kinetic temperature , @xmath3 , is both the simplest and the most fundamental of the many possible `` temperature '' types .",
    "there are alternatives . among the many possible temperatures based on particle coordinates , rather than velocities , the simplest  on which we focus here ",
    "is based on the mean - squared forces , @xmath5 .",
    "this definition of a configurational temperature is derived directly from the potential energy @xmath6 and its space derivatives : @xmath7 this somewhat cumbersome relation appears as an aside in landau and lifshitz classic 1958 text@xcite .",
    "it was also recently rediscovered by rugh , and has subsequently been much discussed@xcite .",
    "this configurational representation of temperature follows most simply from an integration by parts , in the canonical ensemble : @xmath8 @xmath9    about ten years after woodcock and ashurst s introduction of the rescaling isokinetic thermostat in the early 1970s , hoover and evans discovered that the isokinetic velocity - rescaling equations of motion can be derived from gauss principle of least constraint@xcite .",
    "fifteen years after this discovery , dettmann and morriss@xcite found a straightforward hamiltonian approach to these same motion equations .",
    "previously , leete and hoover had derived a hamiltonian formulation which likewise maintained the velocity - based kinetic energy @xmath10 constant@xcite .    a hamiltonian generating the gauss-principle isokinetic equations of motion was not found until 1996@xcite . in the meantime",
    "nos had discovered his canonical - ensemble thermostated dynamics , which is related to two rather different hamiltonians@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is twofold .",
    "first , we explore the relation of the hoover - leete kinetic thermostat work to its successors .",
    "a 2007 literature search shows only a single reference to it@xcite .",
    "we also explore the consequences of a `` landau - lifshitz '' configurational thermostat based on the canonical - ensemble definition rediscovered by rugh .",
    "the nos - hoover equations of motion@xcite are a standard approach to carrying out canonical - ensemble dynamics at a particular temperature @xmath11 .",
    "this approach uses _ feedback _ , controlling the fluctuating kinetic energy with a `` friction coefficient '' or `` control variable '' @xmath12 .",
    "the frictional feedback force is @xmath13 .",
    "the time rate of change of the friction coefficient is based on the current value of the kinetic energy @xmath14 relative to the desired mean value @xmath15 .",
    "the equations of motion also include a characteristic time @xmath16 which determines the time - range over which the feedback acts : @xmath17/\\tau ^2 \\ .\\ ] ] in most cases , including our @xmath18 model studies described in detail in sections v - ix , a reasonable choice of @xmath16 corresponds to a typical collision time or vibration time .",
    "such a choice typically provides gibbs equilibrium canonical phase - space distribution with a gaussian distribution for the friction coefficient @xmath12 : @xmath19 evidently the amplitude of the fluctuations of @xmath12 varies as @xmath20 , where @xmath1 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "thus its effect on the dynamics vanishes in the large - system limit .",
    "_ nonequilibrium _ situations are quite different . by using two or more different friction coefficients ( or `` thermostat variables '' ) temperature differences",
    "can be established , leading to heat flow .",
    "then the corresponding phase - space distributions are no longer smooth and gibbsian , but instead become fractal , with the underlying phase - space trajectories satisfying the second law of thermodynamics infinitely more probable than those violating the law@xcite . in the equilibrium case there is a close connection of nos - hoover mechanics to hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "we describe this connection next .      in 1984",
    "shuichi nos discovered a hamiltonian consistent with gibbs constant - temperature canonical ensemble , @xmath21 he was able to derive the nos - hoover equations of motion described above from his hamiltonian by an artificial `` time scaling '' .",
    "in july of 1996 carl dettmann@xcite discovered a simpler approach to the nos - hoover equations of motion .",
    "dettmann s _ vanishing _ hamiltonian is @xmath22 \\equiv 0 \\ .\\ ] ] provided that dettmann s hamiltonian is set equal to the special value , zero , nos s time - scaling variable @xmath23 can be eliminated .",
    "then the nos - hoover equations of motion result _ without the need for any time scaling_. it needs to be emphasized that this @xmath24 trick does _ not _ work for the prototypical _ nonequilibrium _ case of a system with two different temperatures . in a two - temperature system the two different variables @xmath25 are necessarily coupled and can not both be eliminated , so that dettmann s @xmath24 trick does not work .    there is a special case of nos - hoover dynamics that deserves special mention , the `` isokinetic '' case in which the temperature is constant .",
    "this corresponds to the choice @xmath26 . for isokinetic mechanics dettmann and",
    "morris discovered the special hamiltonian detailed next .",
    "soon after dettmann discovered a hamiltonian route to the nos - hoover motion equations , dettmann and morriss@xcite discovered a related approach to isokinetic ( constant temperature , provided that temperature is defined by the kinetic energy ) hamiltonian dynamics : @xmath27 as usual , the equations of motion follow by differentiation : @xmath28 the accelerations which follow , using the identity , @xmath29 are then exactly the same as those from the isokinetic equations of motion given above : @xmath30",
    "the hamiltonians corresponding to the isokinetic gauss-principle and nos - hoover velocity - based approaches are not the only such means of thermostating equilibrium systems . a straightforward application of nonholonomic lagrangian mechanics , as well as the familiar hamiltonian mechanics outlined in leete s master s thesis@xcite , lead to another type of isokinetic mechanics .",
    "these two equivalent forms of mechanics , both of which can be used to keep the _",
    "velocity_-based kinetic energy @xmath31 constant , while allowing the momentum - based kinetic energy @xmath32 to vary , proceed by modifying the @xmath33 , rather than the @xmath34 , equations .    to distinguish the two different kinetic energies we use the notation :",
    "@xmath35 let us begin with the lagrangian case : @xmath36 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the _ velocity_-based kinetic energy , @xmath37 , and the lagrange multiplier @xmath38 has the task of maintaining @xmath31 at its initial value , @xmath39 , as the motion proceeds .",
    "lagrange s equations of motion follow from the usual textbook differentiations of the lagrangian with respect to the velocities and coordinates : @xmath40 now multiply the @xmath41 equation by @xmath42 and sum : @xmath43 the value of the lagrange multiplier @xmath44 follows : @xmath45 where the last expression , which completes the identity , follows from the hamiltonian given just below .    with leete s help , hoover discovered , in 1979 , that the _ velocity_-based kinetic energy @xmath31 can alternatively be kept constant by using the ( constant in time ) hoover - leete hamiltonian : @xmath46 where @xmath6 is again the usual potential energy and @xmath47 is its initial value .",
    "the constancy of the kinetic energy is easy to see .",
    "the equations of motion , @xmath48 imply that the velocity - based kinetic energy does not vary : @xmath49 \\equiv k_0 \\ .\\ ] ] at the same time , except in the equilibrium case with a large number of degrees of freedom , there is no guarantee that the momentum - based kinetic energy @xmath32 is similar in magnitude to @xmath39 .",
    "but , provided that @xmath50 initially , leete s equations of motion do match the gaussian isokinetic ones to second order , @xmath51 through the second derivatives , @xmath52 , but differ in the _ third _ derivatives , where the meansquared constraint force in the isokinetic case is less than the hoover - leete analog , in accordance with gauss principle of least constraint@xcite .",
    "the constraint of constant temperature in hamiltonian mechanics contradicts the thermodynamic notion that the energy and temperature can not be varied independently in a system of fixed composition and volume .",
    "both @xmath53 and @xmath54 are _ constants _ of the motion , using leete s approach .",
    "provided that the initial conditions are wisely chosen , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 corresponding to the _ same _ thermodynamic state , this approach _ can _ certainly be used to determine equilibrium properties .",
    "we will see , in section viii , what the ( rather strange ) consequences of this thermostat are away from equilibrium .",
    "a ( much ) more complicated hamiltonian thermostat , conserving the force - based _ configurational _ temperature @xmath55 , can be based on straightforward ( though quite tedious ) holonomic hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "a proper configurationally thermostated hamiltonian conserves not only the hamiltonian but also the configurational temperature , @xmath56 here @xmath57 is boltzmann s constant , which we set equal to unity in the numerical work .",
    "a molecular dynamics simulation based on this definition of temperature follows standard hamiltonian mechanics , as the temperature constraint is just a ( complicated ) holonomic ( coordinates only ) constraint .",
    "the simplest procedure begins with the system lagrangian , augmented with a lagrange multiplier @xmath44 which constrains @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian has the form , @xmath59    for success , the initial conditions have to be chosen to correspond to both the desired temperature , @xmath60 , and to the condition @xmath61 .",
    "then , to begin the analytic work , differentiate the temperature equation , @xmath62 , twice with respect to time .",
    "the two time differentiations , using the chain rule , give first @xmath63 and then @xmath64 . by substituting the constrained equations of motion : @xmath65 for the @xmath66 , we obtain the lagrange multiplier @xmath44 . for further details of this calculation ,",
    "see section ix .",
    "the numerical work can be checked by noting that both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are constants of the motion when the calculation is error free .",
    "the @xmath0 model gets its name from the functional form of a quartic `` tethering potential '' , @xmath69 , which links each particle to a fixed lattice site with a cubic restoring force : @xmath70 in the pedagogical simulations which follow we will choose the tethering force constant equal to unity , @xmath71 .",
    "nearest - neighbor particle pair interactions in the @xmath0 model are governed by hooke s law : @xmath72    aoki and kusnezov have carried out a variety of pedagogical heatflow simulations for this model in both one and three space dimensions@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 model has a finite fourier conductivity in one dimension .",
    "the numerical work carried out by aoki and kusnezov established the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity , @xmath73 .",
    "for simplicity in the one - dimensional work which we carry out here , we always choose the nearest - neighbor separation @xmath74 equal to unity .",
    "we also choose the strength of the hookes - law interaction @xmath75 equal to unity . as was abundantly demonstrated by aoki and kusnezov , the combination of a site - based tethering potential with a hookes - law pair potential provides the usual fourier conductivity , with the heat flux proportional to the ( sufficiently small ) temperature gradient .",
    "in what follows we apply four different thermostat constraints to this potential model , using four different dynamical approaches : nos - hoover , gaussian isokinetic , hoover - leete isokinetic , and landau - lifshitz isoconfigurational .",
    "a numerical solution of the heat flow equation for the one - dimensional chain , @xmath76 can be obtained by runge - kutta integration , with a rescaling of the temperatures within the reservoir regions at the end of each timestep accounting for the source and sink terms @xmath77 in the flow equation .",
    "figure 1 shows a fully - converged temperature profile obtained in this way , using hot and cold temperatures of 0.26 and 0.24 , with 400 mesh points .",
    "the spatial gradient operations were replaced by finite - difference approximations : @xmath78 with appropriate subscript changes accounting for the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "with a periodic system composed of four parts , `` hot '' , `` newton@xmath79 '' , `` cold '' , and `` newton@xmath80 '' , each part containing @xmath81 particles , the equations of motion are @xmath82/\\tau ^2 \\ ; \\ ] ] @xmath83/\\tau ^2 \\ ; \\ ] ] in the hot and cold regions , and @xmath84 in the two newtonian regions .",
    "the @xmath18 force @xmath85 depends upon the three coordinates @xmath86 and also includes the tethering force , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the lattice site for the @xmath89th particle in the perfect lattice .",
    "the initial velocities and displacements were selected randomly within ranges : @xmath90 with @xmath91 or @xmath92 chosen to reproduce the desired stationary reservoir temperatures , 0.26 and 0.24 .",
    "the _ average _ temperatures , both kinetic and configurational , from the last half of a 400-particle , 40-million timestep simulation , @xmath93 are shown in figure 2 , along with a comparison solution of the macroscopic heat flow equation . the agreement is quite good , as would be expected from aoki and kusnezov s work .",
    "simulations with two _ gaussian isokinetic thermostats _ , with the same timestep , @xmath94 , and the same equilibration and averaging intervals , produced similar results , maintaining the initial kinetic temperatures throughout .",
    "the averaged profiles , along with a corresponding continuum solution , are shown in figure 3 . again",
    "the agreement , for both the kinetic and the configurational temperatures , is perfectly satisfactory .",
    "the instantaneous ( at time @xmath95 ) values of the total heat added ( from time 0 to time @xmath95 ) to the `` hot '' reservoir as well as that removed from the `` cold '' reservoir are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the sum of the two necessarily oscillates about zero as @xmath95 increases .",
    "straight lines drawn through the data provide an estimate for the fourier conductivity in agreement with the results of aoki and kusnezov s work .",
    "the two conventional thermostat types , nos - hoover and gaussian isokinetic , show that either method can be used to simulate the simple two - temperature heat flow problem .",
    "results with the hamiltonian isokinetic thermostats : @xmath96 where the fixed hot and cold kinetic temperatures @xmath97 are fixed by the initial conditions , but come to differ from the unconstrained momentum - based temperatures @xmath98 . unlike the nos - hoover and gaussian isokinetic profiles ,",
    "the hamiltonian - based profiles show _ no temperature gradients at all_. see figure 5 .",
    "instead there are discontinuities between the fixed kinetic temperatures and the adjacent constant values of the unconstrained newtonian regions . in the latter regions the kinetic and configurational temperatures equilibrate , and match the unconstrained configurational temperature of the thermostated regions . in the thermostated regions",
    "there is no such equilibration .",
    "evidently there are no heat fluxes in the system either . by constraining not only the energy ( through the constant hamiltonian driving the motion ) but also the kinetic temperatures , the system is evidently prevented from supporting heat flow .",
    "the hamiltonian nature of the motion equations also prevents the formation of the multifractal phase - space distributions associated with nonequilibrium stationary states@xcite . a more detailed analysis of the reasons for the failure of this hamiltonian approach",
    "could perhaps be based on a detailed analysis of the microscopic equations describing heat flux@xcite .",

    "this is to choose the velocities equal to zero so that @xmath116 .",
    "a typical profile using two configurational thermostats is shown in figure 6 .",
    "just as in the hoover - leete isokinetic case there is no equilibration of the constrained temperature ( here configurational ) .",
    "the unconstrained kinetic temperature equilibrates throughout the system to a value dependent upon the initial conditions .",
    "evidently the landau - lifshitz constrained configurational thermostat is quite useless for nonequilibrium work .",
    "the results obtained with the gaussian isokinetic and nose - hoover thermostats are quite consistent with the past history of their use over the last quarter century@xcite . for these familiar thermostats",
    "there was no problem in reaching a nonequilibrium steady state with temperature profiles and heat fluxes very similar to those expected from macroscopic hydrodynamics using fourier s law .",
    "on the other hand , the results obtained with _ purely hamiltonian _ mechanics , using either the hoover - leete constrained isokinetic or the landau - lifshitz constrained configurational thermostats were both unexpected and thought - provoking . both hamiltonian approaches stably constrained their target temperatures in the two reservoir regions .",
    "nevertheless temperature differences led to no net heat flow and the computed temperature profiles bore no resemblance to the predictions of hydrodynamics . the kinetic and configurational temperatures , though _ unequal _ in the constrained reservoirs , @xmath117 \\ , \\ ] ] _ were _ equal ( to yet a third nearly - constant temperature ) in the unconstrained bulk newtonian regions : @xmath118 \\ .\\ ] ] these results emphasize the fact that _ nonhamiltonian _ dynamics is absolutely necessary to the realistic modeling of nonequilibrium systems .",
    "a direct proof / understanding of the failure of the hamiltonian systems to show a nonvanishing heat flux would be most welcome .",
    "this work was first presented at a mexico city workshop organized by francisco uribe at universidad autnoma metropolitana - iztapalapa in january , 2007 .",
    "subsequently , a shorter version was presented at the schrdinger instutite workshop , in wien , honoring the 65th birthday of herr professor doktor harald posch .",
