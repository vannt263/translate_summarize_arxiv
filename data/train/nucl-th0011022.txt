    "since we are still a long way from calculating the scattering and electromagnetic production of mesons on baryons directly from qcd , effective field - theoretical descriptions in terms of purely hadronic degrees of freedom are usually employed to compute such processes .",
    "qcd is assumed to provide the justification for the parameters or cutoff functions used in the various approaches . at threshold ,",
    "su(2 ) chiral perturbation theory has been moderately successful to describe pion photo- and electroproduction ; attempts to expand these techniques into the su(3 ) arena to eta and kaon production are still in their infancy . in the resonance region one",
    "usually relies on effective lagrangian approaches where a potential or driving term is defined that includes standard nonresonant @xmath10-,@xmath11- , and @xmath12-channel poles along with resonances in each of these channels as bare fields which are then dressed through the final - state interaction .",
    "only the dressed @xmath10-channel poles above threshold are identified with physical resonances , the nonpolar part is considered background for the particular process ( even though it may contain bare baryon resonances in the @xmath12-channel ) .",
    "while dynamical models involving various approximations for the bethe - salpeter equation are becoming increasingly successful in the description of pion photoproduction , the hadronic final state interaction in kaon photoproduction has usually been neglected . without rescattering contributions the @xmath13-matrix is simply approximated by the driving term alone which is assumed to be given by a series of tree - level diagrams @xcite .",
    "clearly , neglecting the final meson - baryon interaction in the full meson photoproduction @xmath13-matrix automatically leads to violation of unitarity since flux that can `` leak out '' into inelastic channels has not been properly accounted for . enforcing unitarity",
    "dynamically requires solving a system of coupled channels with all possible final states .",
    "the most recent coupled - channels approach within an effective lagrangian framework has been developed by feuster and mosel @xcite and extended to higher energies and additional channels by waluyo _",

    "nucleon resonance parameters are extracted by simultaneously analyzing all available data for reactions involving the initial and final states @xmath14 and @xmath15 up to @xmath16 gev .",
    "the calculations employ the @xmath17-matrix approximation , placing both intermediate particles on their mass shell .",
    "this procedure still allows for the resonance widths to be generated dynamically , while the real part of the self - energy is absorbed in an effective resonance mass that is determined by the fit .",
    "our understanding of the kaon - baryon interaction is still much poorer than our knowledge of the pion - nucleon force , exemplified by the uncertainty in the kaon - hyperon - nucleon coupling constants @xmath18 and @xmath19 . unlike the well established pion - nucleon interaction which yields a pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath20 around 13.7 ,",
    "the kaon coupling constants extracted from different reactions ( from hadronic to electromagnetic ) have much larger uncertainties , as shown in table[tab : cct ] .",
    "most isobar models for kaon photoproduction over the last 30 years have left the leading @xmath21 couplings as open parameters to be determined by the data . constraining these values to within the su(3 )",
    "range gave results which were overpredicting the data by up to a factor of 10 .",
    "therefore , when left as free parameters the couplings came out to be significantly smaller than the su(3 ) range . on the other side , most extractions based on hadronic reactions yielded couplings constants well within the su(3 ) limits .",
    "this discrepancy suggested that an important piece of physics has been left out in isobar models : the extended structure of the hadrons , parametrized in terms of a hadronic form factor .",

    "thus , for this most basic case , the addition of a fourth contact - type graph is not necessary for preserving gauge invariance . in all other instances ,",
    "however , one needs additional currents to ensure gauge invariance and thus current conservation . for bare hadronic vertices with pseudovector coupling ,",
    "this extra current is the well - known kroll - ruderman contact term .    irrespective of the coupling type , however , most isobaric models with bare vertices show a divergence at higher energies , which clearly points to the need for introducing hadronic form factors to cut off this undesirable behavior .",
    "for example , recent calculations @xcite demonstrated that many models which are able to describe @xmath48 experimental data tend to unrealistically overpredict the @xmath49 channel .",

    "the gauge invariance of the total amplitude is ensured by the self - consistency of these dressing effects , by additional interaction currents and by the effects of hadronic scattering processes in the final state @xcite .",
    "schematically , the interaction currents and the final - state contributions can always be written in the form of an additional contact diagram .",
    "if one now seeks to describe the dressing of vertices on a more accessible , somewhat less rigorous , level , one introduces phenomenological form factors for the individual @xmath10- , @xmath12- , and @xmath11-channel vertices .",
    "then , to ensure gauge invariance and to remain close to the topological structure of the full underlying theory , the simplest option is to add contact - type currents which mock up the effects of the interaction currents and final - state scattering processes .",
    "in addition to the hadronic form factors multiplying the @xmath10- , @xmath12- , and @xmath11-channel diagrams , the longitudinal pieces of the gauge - invariance - preserving additional currents are only determined up to an arbitrary function @xmath52 . for practical purposes ,",
    "one of the simplest choices @xcite for this arbitrary function @xmath52 has been taken to be a linear combination of the form factors for the three kinematic situations in which the dressed vertices appear , i.e. , @xmath53 which introduces two more free parameters to be determined by fits to the experimental data .",
    "this method allows fixing the @xmath21 couplings to the ( approximate ) su(3 ) values and has proven to be flexible and adequate for a good phenomenological description of experimental data .",
    "it has been used in all modern studies on kaon photoproduction in an effective lagrangian framework  @xcite .",
    "ultimately , high - quality data should allow an extrapolation to a born term pole , possibly via dispersion relations , and an extraction of the @xmath54 and @xmath19 coupling constants .",
    "a precise determination of these couplings constants is especially important in view of the fact that the @xmath55 coupling appears to be much smaller than its su(3 ) symmetry value @xcite .      from pion photo- and electroproduction",
    "it is well known that for an adequate description of these electromagnetic processes the vector meson @xmath11-channel contributions play an important role as part of the background . especially for the @xmath57 reaction",
    "the @xmath58 meson is known to be an essential dynamical ingredient .",
    "similarly , the equivalent vector meson with strangeness , the @xmath59(892 ) , has been included in the description of kaon photoproduction from the beginning .",
    "it was not until 1988 , that the pseudovector meson @xmath60(1270 ) was identified as also having an important effect in model fitting @xcite .",
    "similar non - strange pseudovector mesons [ the @xmath61(1170 ) and the @xmath62(1235 ) states ] have never been found to be important in pion photoproduction .",
    "one problem with the standard vector meson contributions in an effective lagrangian framework is their divergence at energies beyond @xmath63 gev .",
    "this is the energy region which is ruled by regge theory which starts from a description of @xmath11-channel regge trajectory exchanges at forward angles .",
    "these trajectories represent the exchange of a family of mesons with the same internal quantum numbers and allow a natural description of the smooth energy and angular dependence observed in the data at high @xmath64 .",
    "reference @xcite has recently applied this approach to high - energy pion and kaon photoproduction by replacing the usual pole - like feynman propagator of a single particle exchanged in the @xmath11-channel by the so - called regge propagator while keeping the vertex structure given by the effective lagrangian for the ground state meson of the trajectory .",
    "for the transition region between @xmath10-channel resonance excitation and @xmath11-channel regge exchange , duality would demand that exchanges are limited to either all @xmath10-channel or all @xmath11-channel contributions . in practice , however , since no resonance model ever includes all @xmath10-channel @xmath65 states the vector mesons must be included as part of the background in some form .",
    "crossing symmetry requires that the same amplitude which describes the @xmath67 reaction should be able to describe the radiative capture process @xmath68 , when the mandelstam variables @xmath10 and @xmath12 are interchanged . due to su(3 )",
    "symmetry breaking crossing symmetry in a rigorous sense can not be maintained since nucleons and hyperons have different excitation spectra .",
    "some studies  @xcite have applied a weaker crossing constraint by including selected hyperon resonances in the @xmath12-channel of the @xmath67 reaction and fitting the radiative capture rate , @xmath68 , for kaons at rest along with the @xmath67 data .",
    "since hyperon resonances propagate in the @xmath10-channel in radiative kaon capture this process would be an excellent tool to constrain @xmath69 properties . in practice , only the capture rate at threshold has been measured ; the energy dependence of this process is unknown .",
    "on the other hand , since hyperon resonances propagate in the @xmath12-channel in @xmath67 they contribute to the background sector - and not to the resonance sector - of the kaon photoproduction process . because of the remaining uncertainties in the background other studies @xcite have refrained from including hyperon resonances .",
    "one of the most contentious issues in the phenomenological description of kaon photoproduction on the nucleon has been the choice of s - channel nucleon resonances in the production amplitude .",
    "many studies have selected resonances that contribute to the kaon photoproduction process by their relative contribution to the overall @xmath51 of the fit  @xcite . since this",
    "is usually done in tree - level calculations connections with other reaction channels are difficult to establish . as a consequence ,",
    "some studies find large couplings of the @xmath71 channel to spin 5/2 resonances , even though neither recent coupled - channels analyses @xcite nor older partial - wave analyses for pionic @xmath71 production @xcite give any indication that such states are important .",

    "nuclear calculations of pion , eta or kaon photoproduction usually need amplitudes that are easy to incorporate , have a straightforward off - shell extension , can be boosted to different lorentz frames and are fast in terms of computer time .",
    "this is especially true for few - body calculations where high - dimensional integrals are solved in momentum space , requiring the subroutine for the elementary operator to be used on the order of @xmath90 times . for this purpose",
    "the elementary amplitude is then parameterized in a form that makes it easy to use , describes the elementary data well and preserves as many of the field - theoretical constraints as possible .",
    "in general , this involves constructing a tree - level amplitude , selecting a limited number of resonances which have been shown to be significant by multichannel analyses and refitting the coupling constants to the experimental data .",
    "work over the last several years has shown that restoring gauge invariance in the presence of form factors is straightforward at the tree level . however , neglecting the final meson - baryon interaction in the meson photoproduction amplitude automatically leads to a violation of unitarity which is more difficult to restore .",
    "one possibility is to allow for energy - dependent phases for each multipole , as is done in the mainz maid pion electroproduction isobar model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , imposing dispersion relations would help to establish the proper analyticity properties of such effective amplitudes .",
    "no such attempts have yet been done for kaon photo- and electroproduction .",
    "with the recent successful completion of the jlab hall c experiment 89 - 009 @xcite which produced discrete hypernuclear states with electrons for the first time , the exploration of hypernuclear structure through electromagnetic probes is becoming a reality .",
    "in contrast to the hadronic reactions @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the @xmath48 process uses , besides the photon , the rather weakly interacting @xmath93 with its mean free path of 5 - 7 fm in the nuclear medium , allowing the process to occur deep in the nuclear interior . in comparison , the @xmath94 and the @xmath95",

    "figure  [ hyplabf1 ] illustrates the differences between the @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath48 production reactions , both in terms of their relative excitation strength and in terms of the structure of the produced hypernuclear spectrum for p - shell hypernuclei . at a strength of several 100 mb /",
    "sr the @xmath91 reaction predominantly excites natural parity states with low angular momentum , such as the ground state @xmath97 or the substitutional state @xmath98 . reduced by about a factor of 50 in cross section , the @xmath92 reaction still excites natural parity levels , but selecting the ones with large angular momentum , such as the @xmath99 and @xmath100 states , reflecting the larger momentum transfer of the process .",

    "this comparison demonstrates that full spectroscopic information can only be obtained with a combination of all three techniques .",
    "the subject of exciting discrete hypernuclear states through kaon photoproduction was studied extensively about 8 - 10 years ago @xcite but has been mostly dormant for the last several years , awaiting data taking .",
    "therefore , the number of planned and approved experiments to take place within the next few years is expected to revive interest in this field .      as shown in detail in ref .",

    "this leads to a differential cross section at @xmath119 which increases as @xmath120 increases , from around 15 nb / sr at 0.84 gev to 330 nb / sr at 2 gev for the particular transition shown .",
    "however , the momentum transfer increases more rapidly for non - zero kaon angles at higher photon energies .",
    "thus , the angular distributions become more forward peaked and fall off more rapidly .",
    "the energy chosen for an experiment therefore depends on the desired result : if the goal is to perform hypernuclear spectroscopy choosing a higher photon energy around 2 gev , while detecting the @xmath93 under @xmath118 would be advantageous .",

    "@xcite shown in fig.[hyplabf7 ] were obtained using the @xmath178 reaction , we propose to rather photoproduce such coulomb - assisted @xmath164-hypernuclear bound states through reactions such as @xmath179 .",
    "this would eliminate the need for a strongly absorbed pion in the initial state and open the possibility to populate deeply bound @xmath164-hypernuclear states .",
    "again , high - resolution detectors are imperative for this kind of second - generation experiment .      in the periodic table of hypernuclei ,",
    "the hypertriton , a bound state consisting of a proton , a neutron , and a lambda , holds a special place as the lightest hypernucleus .",
    "since neither the @xmath124 nor the @xmath165 interactions are sufficiently strong to produce a bound two - body system with @xmath180 , the hypertriton is the first system in which the @xmath0 force , including the interesting @xmath1-@xmath164 conversion potential , can be tested in the nuclear environment .",
    "therefore , the hypertriton plays an important role in hypernuclear physics , similar to the deuteron in nuclear physics .",
    "@xcite has carried out a detailed investigation of this system using faddeev equations and found that binding the hypertriton with its small binding of 130 kev ( with respect to @xmath181 break - up ) , requires a fine - tuning of the @xmath0 @xmath182 amplitude which is found in only few potentials , such as the nsc89@xcite . while this feature makes the hypertriton a fascinating system to study , it is precisely the weak binding that makes this loosely bound system , which displays halo - like features similar to neutron - rich nuclei near the neutron drip line , a difficult system to produce in high - momentum reactions such as @xmath183 .",
    "in contrast to the transition matrix elements for @xmath77-shell hypernuclei [ eq.([eq : basic ] ) ] , the nuclear matrix elements for the process on @xmath184he do not separate into a many - body nuclear structure part and a single - particle one - body integral , but they are evaluated straightforwardly in terms of an integral over all internal momenta and states contributing to the process @xcite",

    "( [ efq1 ] ) reduces the reaction cross section of eq .",
    "( [ msabit ] ) by two orders of magnitude compared to the elementary reaction . as @xmath188 increases ,",
    "the cross section drops quickly , since the nuclear momentum transfer increases rapidly as function of @xmath188 ( see fig .  [ hyplabf2 ] ) .",
    "figure [ hyplabf8 ] also shows the significant difference between the cross sections calculated with the approximation of eq .",
    "( [ msabit ] ) and the full result obtained from eq .",
    "( [ tfi33 ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the `` factorization '' approximation , since the integrations of both spin - independent and spin - dependent amplitudes over the internal momentum weighted by the two wave functions lead to destructive interference and further reduce the cross section .",
    "the cross section for kaon photoproduction is in fact very small , of the order of about 1 nb / sr at most , and even smaller for larger kaon angles .",
    "the underlying reason is the lack of high momentum components in the @xmath189 wave function , inhibiting hypernuclear formation .",
    "nevertheless , the electromagnetic production of the hypertriton has to be compared to the production with strong probes , e.g. @xmath190 whose cross sections also have been predicted to be around 1 nb / sr@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ hyplabf9 ] , @xmath191waves alone are insufficient to describe the reaction . inclusion of the higher partial waves further reduce the cross section by a factor of more than three .",
    "this can be traced to an overlap of @xmath192wave components in the @xmath184he wave function with the dominant @xmath191wave in the hypertriton . in comparison ,",
    "the higher partial waves in pion photo- and electroproduction@xcite decrease the cross section by at most 20% .",
    "[ hyplabf9 ] also compares calculations with @xmath191waves using both a simple analytical model for the hypertriton wave function @xcite and a correlated three - body faddeev wave function @xcite that includes the proper short - range behavior . while the cross sections obtained with the faddeev wave functions does show more structure , the difference in magnitude are only of order 10 - 20% .",
    "calculations coming up on @xmath193he and @xmath193h @xcite will supplement these studies on @xmath194h and , because of their richer spectra , will allow an even closer examination of the @xmath0 force .",
    "due to the sizable momentum transfer to the hypernuclear system the probability of forming such bound states is in fact rather small . ref .",
    "@xcite has estimated this formation probability to be around 5 - 10% of the total @xmath48 strength on nuclear targets , thus most of the kaon production events will come from quasifree production , a@xmath195b , where the kaon can be a @xmath93 or @xmath196 , and the hyperon can be either a @xmath1 or a @xmath164 .      in order to explore the @xmath0 force more directly , hyperon production processes on the deuteron , such as @xmath197 , appear as natural candidates .",
    "the hope is that the pole structure of the @xmath0 scattering operator will have visible effects in such a production process . in a recent study @xcite the @xmath191-matrix pole structure for the @xmath0 system",
    "has been investigated for various presently used @xmath0 forces .",
    "as is well known there is no bound state in the @xmath198 system , but the present potential models support poles of the @xmath191-matrix which are close to the @xmath1 and @xmath164 thresholds . near the @xmath1 threshold",
    "there are two @xmath191-wave virtual states at about @xmath199 and @xmath200 mev , and close to the @xmath164 threshold there is a @xmath201@xmath202 pole which appears at different unphysical sheets of the riemann energy surface depending on the potential used .",
    "this pole causes cusp - like structures in the @xmath124 scattering at the @xmath164 threshold .",
    "their forms and strengths depend on the potential employed .",
    "pioneering work in inclusive and exclusive @xmath93 photoproduction on the deuteron has been done before @xcite based on simple hyperon - nucleon forces .",
    "these calculations suggested that significant @xmath0 final - state interaction effects be present near the production thresholds .",
    "recently , these results were reexamined @xcite using various recently formulated @xmath0 forces @xcite together with realistic @xmath203 forces and an updated elementary photoproduction operator of the @xmath204 pair on a nucleon .",
    "for kaon photoproduction on the deuteron the nuclear matrix element can be conveniently rewritten by applying the mller wave operator generating the final scattering state to the right : @xmath205 since we allow for @xmath206 conversion the state @xmath207 as well as the corresponding free state @xmath208 is a row with a @xmath1 and a @xmath164 component .",
    "the operator @xmath209 applied to the deuteron state obeys the integral equation    @xmath210    equation  ( [ ic6 ] ) contains the elementary operator @xmath211 producing a specific hyperon @xmath31 and @xmath212 is the hyperon - nucleon force including @xmath213 conversion .",
    "figure [ hyplabf10 ] compares inclusive cross sections for @xmath214 in plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) with calculations that include fsi generated with the hyperon - nucleon forces nsc89 @xcite and nsc97f @xcite which both lead to the correct hypertriton binding energy .",
    "the two pronounced peaks around @xmath215 945 and 809 mev / c can be understood in pwia .",
    "they are due to quasi - free processes , where one of the nucleons in the deuteron is a spectator and has zero momentum in the lab system .",
    "this then leads to a vanishing argument @xmath216 in the deuteron wavefunction , which causes the peaks . under this condition",
    "the kinematics of the @xmath155-induced process on a single nucleon fixes the peak positions for @xmath217 in the lab system .",
    "figure  [ hyplabf10 ] shows significant deviations between the plane wave result and the results with fsi based on the nsc89 and nsc97f hyperon - nucleon forces . near the @xmath218 threshold",
    "the fsi enhances the cross section by up to 90% . near the @xmath219 threshold",
    "the effects are even more dramatic .",
    "while nsc89 slightly enhances the cross section , nsc97f leads to a much stronger effect with a prominent cusp - like structure .",
    "the two @xmath0 potentials lead to predictions which differ by up to 35% .",
    "this can be traced back to the location of the @xmath191-matrix pole for the @xmath220 system around the @xmath165 threshold .",
    "each of the two @xmath0 potentials generate a pole in the state @xmath201@xmath202 near @xmath221 .",
    "the potential nsc89 leads to a pole position which in a single channel case would be called a virtual state ( in this case it would lie exactly on the imaginary axis ) .",
    "the coupling of the @xmath1 and @xmath164 channels moves the pole for the nsc97f force away from the positive imaginary axis into the second @xmath222 quadrant . in a time - dependent description",
    "the energy related to that pole position leads to a decreasing amplitude . in the literature , this sort of pole is sometimes referred to as an ` unstable bound state ' .",
    "apparently , the actual pole position depends on the details of the @xmath0 force .",
    "the pole positions are an inherent property of the @xmath0 forces and the actual location chosen by nature should be determined with the help of experimental measurements .",
    "quasifree production on heavier nuclei allows for the study of the reaction process in the nuclear medium as well as final state interaction effects without being obscured by the details of the nuclear transitions as discussed above .",
    "the predictions presented here @xcite are in a dwia framework that has been successfully applied in previous work on quasifree pion photo- and electroproduction @xcite and eta photoproduction on nuclei @xcite .",
    "the key ingredients are :    1 .",
    "the single - particle wave function and spectroscopic factor , usually taken from electron scattering , 2 .   the elementary kaon photoproduction amplitude , 3 .   the distorted kaon wave function which can be taken from kaon elastic scattering in case of the @xmath93 , 4 .",
    "the hyperon - nucleus final - state interaction .    in contrast to hypernuclear production discussed above ,",
    "the reaction is _ quasifree _ , meaning that the magnitude of @xmath223 has a wide range , including zero .",
    "since the reaction amplitude is proportional to the fourier transform of the bound state single particle wavefunction , it falls off quickly as the momentum transfer increases .",
    "thus , we will restrict ourselves to the low @xmath223 region ( @xmath224 500 mev / c ) where the nuclear recoil effects can be safely neglected for nuclei of @xmath225 . the nuclear structure aspects are now contained in the spectroscopic factor , and in the single - particle matrix element of eq .",
    "( [ sixdim ] ) the bound - state @xmath1 wave function has to be replaced by a scattering state , obtained from solving a schrodinger equation with some optical potential .",
    "very few optical potentials have been constructed for the @xmath1 and @xmath164 , mostly due to lack of data . here",
    ", we employ the global optical model of ref .",
    "it is based on a global nucleon - nucleus dirac optical potential fit @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the potential are motivated by the constituent quark model and adjusted to fit the hypernuclear binding energy data .",
    "we use its nonrelativistic equivalent version which has a central and a spin - orbit part , @xmath226 . note that the spin - orbit part is multiplied by a factor that depends on the partial wave under consideration . fig .",
    "[ hyplabf11 ] shows the real and imaginary parts of both @xmath227 and @xmath228 on @xmath229c at 200 mev kinetic energy for the @xmath1 and the @xmath230 . for comparison ,",
    "they are also shown for the proton .",
    "the real parts of the central potential are clearly smaller than the proton potential by around a factor of two , reflecting the fact that lambdas and sigmas have a smaller binding energy in hypernuclei .",
    "the imaginary part of the @xmath164 s central potential is similar in magnitude to that of the nucleon , due to the large @xmath166 conversion width .",
    "the very small spin - orbit potential of the @xmath1 is a reflection of the @xmath124 spin - orbit force which is known to be small .",

    "[ hyplabf12 ] for the reaction @xmath231 at @xmath232=1.4 gev and @xmath233 mev / c under quasifree kinematics . as the kaon angle increases , the kaon energy decreases while the hyperon energy increases . in this particular case",
    ", the kaon and hyperon energies can reach around 500 to 700 mev .",
    "figure  [ hyplabf12 ] shows the differential cross sections as well as two polarization observables , comparing pwia calculations with results that include hyperon and kaon final state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "kaon distortion reduces the cross sections by about 10 - 20% but has little effect on the polarization observables . including the hyperon fsi reduces the angular distributions by up to 30% at forward angles .",
    "again , with the exception of the photon polarization in @xmath234 production , the polarization observables are barely affected by the inclusion of fsi .",
    "this situation is similar to previous findings in quasifree pion and eta photoproduction @xcite .",
    "it opens the possibility to use the polarization observables as a way to study modifications of the basic production process in the nuclear medium .",
    "the magnitudes of the @xmath164 and @xmath235 observables is sizeable and should be measurable .",
    "driven by new experimental results from facilities like jlab and elsa , the field of strangeness production with photons and electrons is experiencing a revival .",
    "experimental proposals , some approved at jlab over ten years ago , are being carried out and begin to produce data of unprecedented quality . in the meantime , our understanding of the elementary production mechanism has evolved significantly over the last decade . within effective lagrangian approaches the need for hadronic form factors has become clear , along with their implications for gauge invariance . born coupling constants ,",
    "long found to be too small in model fits , can now be reconciled with their su(3 ) values and upcoming high - quality data should allow extracting their precise values by extrapolating to a born pole using dispersion relations . in the resonance sector",
    "new coupled - channels analyses are beginning to shed light on the relevant resonances by combining data from kaon photoproduction with information from hadronic strangeness production and with the vast reservoir of data in pion scattering and pion photoproduction .",
    "attempts to describe threshold production through chiral perturbation theory are still in their infancy but may eventually lead to a better understanding of the validity of chiral expansions in the su(3 ) sector . with our knowledge of the elementary kaon production amplitude expanding , predictions for kaon productions on nuclear targets are becoming more reliable . here",
    "the few - body sector is especially appealing due to the rigor of the theoretical calculations .",
    "modern hyperon - nucleon forces can be studied directly in quasifree kaon production on the deuteron .",
    "the @xmath236 and 4 hypernuclei can now be handled theoretically without approximations and , using the nucleus as a spin - isospin filter , place severe constraints on certain parts of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "jlab experiments are just beginning to take advantage of the photoproduction mechanism to excite unnatural parity and high - spin states ; this spectroscopic information will supplement our knowledge of the effective @xmath124 interaction from present hadronic probes employed at kek and bnl . the full power of the almost distortionless @xmath237 reaction to populate deeply bound states in heavier nuclei and study details of the @xmath1 wave function will hopefully be used in second - generation experiments at jlab and mami c. in the coming years , these experimental and theoretical developments should lead to a much improved understanding not only of the @xmath0-force , but also of hadronic physics in the su(3 ) realm in general .",
