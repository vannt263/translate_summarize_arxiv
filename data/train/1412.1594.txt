    "immanants , i.e. , matrix functions connected to irreducible characters of symmetric groups , were introduced and studied by littlewood  @xcite . they are widely used in algebraic combinatorics , e.g. , immanants of certain matrices whose entries are symmetric functions define the schur functions .",
    "the best known immanants are the determinant and the permanent of a matrix .",
    "the determinant is well known from its extended use in linear algebra .",
    "many results on the permanents can be found in the seminal book of minc  @xcite .",
    "other interesting applications are obtained in the connection with positive semi - definite hermitian matrices .",
    "recently they have been used in a mathematical description of three - channel optical networks  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite the authors use immanants to analyze coincidence rates in connection with bosonsampling bosonsampling computation originally introduced in  @xcite .",
    "immanants also appear in statistical physics , see  @xcite .",
    "see also recent experiments on permanents in  @xcite .    for every symmetric group @xmath3",
    "there are several immanants defined , their numbers being equal to the number of corresponding conjugacy classes of the group . in this work",
    "we use immanants to generalize symmetric and antisymmetric orbit functions , families of multivariable complex functions related to weyl groups of simple lie algebras @xmath0 .",
    "these functions can be written as the determinant and permanent of a particular matrix of order @xmath4 , see  @xcite . by considering general immanants of the same matrix",
    "we obtain new families of functions .",
    "we study their properties , e.g. , their symmetries with respect to elements of the weyl group @xmath0 , their products and continuous orthogonality .",
    "symmetric and antisymmetric orbit functions were studied in detail in  @xcite .",
    "their orthogonality relations can be found in  @xcite and their discretization is completely described in  @xcite .",
    "other families of orbit functions are defined in the connection of even weyl subgroups and so - called sign homomorphisms  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "chapter 2 reviews some facts from the theory of characters of finite groups and the definition of immanants of a matrix . in chapter 3",
    "we present the connection between the symmetry group @xmath5 and the weyl group of simple lie algebra @xmath0 , see , for example , refs @xcite .",
    "immanants functions of @xmath6 are then defined in chapter 4 , including examples and properties for the particular case @xmath7 .",
    "the main result lies in chapter 5 , where we generalize some properties of immanants functions and we prove theorem  [ maintheorem ] describing continuous orthogonality of immanant functions .",
    "we conclude with several remarks in chapter 6 .",
    "immanants are a generalization of the determinant and permanent of a matrix defined using irreducible characters of symmetric groups . in this subsection we list some well known facts about irreducible characters which will be used in what follows . for a good review of the theory of immanants of finite groups",

    "it can be written as a union of its conjugacy classes .",
    "irreducible characters @xmath9 map each class to a complex number . the number of conjugacy classes equals the number of irreducible characters .",
    "the values of characters are then listed in so - called character tables , see table  [ characters ] .",
    "row orthogonality relations hold , i.e. , for every irreducible characters @xmath10 we have @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the order of the group @xmath8 and @xmath13 is the kronecker delta .",
    "it also holds that for every element @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that if every @xmath14 is conjugated to its inverse then all the characters have real values .",
    "this is a case for example for all the symmetry groups .",
    "finally , we will need the following formula for the convolution of characters  @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the degree of the character @xmath18",

    "let @xmath20 be a matrix of order @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
