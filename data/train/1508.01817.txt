    "one of the fundamental characteristics defining charge transport properties of any disordered material is a density of states ( dos ) @xmath0 , i.e. a distribution density of random energy @xmath1 of a charge carrier hopping in the bulk of the material . in some situations",
    "the very functional form of @xmath0 could be used for a quick estimation of the relevant transport properties of the material .",
    "for example , if the dos decays fast for @xmath2 , then the non - dispersive quasi - equilibrium transport regime eventually takes place for @xmath3 and the stationary density of occupied states @xmath4 is developed ( we assume here the boltzmann statistics ) .",
    "let the maximum of this distribution is located at @xmath5 . in quasi - equilibrium regime",
    "the limiting step for the charge transport is a carrier escape from deep states where carrier hops up in energy to perform a corresponding transition in space .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the final energy of such hop is located somewhere near the maximum @xmath6 of the dos .",
    "hence , a rough estimation of the temperature dependence of the carrier drift mobility @xmath7 for low electric field should be @xmath8 with @xmath9 serving as an effective activation energy . for the gaussian",
    "dos @xmath10 typical for amorphous organic semiconductors @xcite , @xmath11 and @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "this simple estimation gives an exact leading asymptotics for the low field mobility temperature dependence in 1d case @xcite and differs from the corresponding asymptotics in higher dimensions by the numeric factor @xmath13 in the exponent @xcite .",
    "more refined approach invoking the conception of so - called transport energy provides even better description of the dependence @xmath7 @xcite , at least for the materials with spatially non - correlated random energy landscape .",
    "experimental data on the mobility temperature dependence suggest that in organic materials @xmath14 ev @xcite and , hence , at the room temperature @xmath15 .",
    "for some materials charge transport has been observed in time - of - flight experiments even for @xmath16 @xcite , though in that case it is highly dispersive .",
    "this means that typically the maximum of the occupied dos , relevant for the quasi - equilibrium transport , is located at the tail of the initial dos .",
    "there is a strong evidence that in organic materials a major contribution to the total dos has the electrostatic origin : it is produced by the interaction of charge carrier with randomly located and oriented static dipoles and quadrupoles .",
    "estimation of the electrostatic @xmath17 taking into account typical dipole and qudrupole moments and concentration of polar molecules provides values in reasonable agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "models of dipolar glass ( dg ) and quadrupolar glass ( qg ) have been suggested for description of random energy landscape in amorphous organic materials . in these models",
    "it is assumed that there is no correlation between orientations of dipoles or quadrupoles .",
    "the models naturally produce highly spatially correlated random energy landscape necessary for realization of the specific poole - frenkel mobility field dependence @xmath18 @xcite .    until now",
    "an accurate calculation of the behavior of the far tails of the dos in dg and qg models has not been carried out . for dg and qg models",
    "the central peak of dos has a gaussian shape if concentration of dipoles and quadrupoles is not too low @xcite .",
    "this shape is essentially guaranteed by the central limit theorem which is not valid for the far tails of the distribution .",
    "typical distribution of dipoles relevant for the main body of dos and for the far tail are qualitatively different ( see fig [ 2_typical_dist ] ( a ) and ( b ) , correspondingly ) . in this paper",
    "we are going to carry out a direct calculation of the functional form of the tails of dos in dg and qg models and estimate a possible effect of the tail shape on charge transport .     in the main body of the dos",

    "let us consider two separate cases , i.e. the cases of pure axial ( aq ) and planar ( pq ) quadrupoles .",
    "note that there is a very distinct difference between density of states in aq and pq glasses .",
    "for pq the inversion @xmath55 that transforms the positive carrier energy to negative one and vice versa is equivalent to the spatial rotation of the quadrupole .",
    "all spatial configurations of the quadrupole have the equal weight , hence , the dos is symmetric around @xmath42 . for",

    "substantial asymmetry is developing only for far tails of the dos because for typical high concentration of quadrupoles the main body of the dos has a gaussian form and , hence , is symmetric .",

    "this asymptotics is valid for both positive and negative @xmath1 .",
    "analogous to the dg model , saddle point approximation is valid for axial and planar quadrupoles if @xmath88 .",
    "this inequality is again valid if @xmath89 .",
    "arbitrary quadrupole is a linear combination of axial and planar quadrupoles . for the corresponding qg model the actual far tail asymptotics",
    "is determined by the contribution of the component providing the slowest decay of dos .",
    "main body of dos in dg and qg models is gaussian and , thus , symmetric .",
    "this means that the effect of the energetic disorder on the transport of electrons and holes is exactly the same if the transport is determined by the main body of dos .",
    "analytic results and computer simulation show that the tails of dos at @xmath90 are still gaussian @xcite .",
    "far tails in the qg model becomes asymmetric and provide inequivalent environment for carriers of the opposite signs .",
    "unfortunately , experimental observation of the quasi - equilibrium charge transport for low temperature @xmath91 is extremely difficult .",
    "still , we could provide some estimations for the low field mobility temperature dependence in the dg model for low temperature . using the approach described in the introduction and estimating the effective activation energy using the position of the maximum of the occupied dos , we obtain for the leading asymptotics @xmath92 this estimation is valid when @xmath93 and the second term in is dominating .",
    "for the axial qg model the corresponding relation is ( for one particular side of dos ) @xmath94\\ ] ] with the trivial modification for the other side of the axial qg dos or for the case of planar qg . in all cases",
    "the temperature dependence becomes weaker in comparison with the gaussian dos due to the more faster decay of the dos tail .",
    "in fact , weakening of the dependence @xmath7 for the time - of - flight experiments at low temperature has been observed previously @xcite , but the experimental photocurrent transients are so dispersive that this effect is better attributed to the non - equilibrium transport .",
    "borsenberger et al .",
    "@xcite showed that in the popular gaussian disorder model transition from the non - dispersive to dispersive transport leads to the change of the low field @xmath7 dependence from @xmath95 to @xmath96 , e.g. the slope of the @xmath97 vs @xmath98 dependence becomes smaller by the factor @xmath99 . in some situations in the low temperature region",
    "the decrease of the slope becomes much greater ( see fig . 11 in @xcite ) , indicating a possibility of the deviation of the shape of the dos from the gaussian one .",
    "measurement of the stationary space charge limited current @xcite or technique of charge carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage ( celiv ) @xcite makes it possible to study the quasi - equilibrium transport even for very low temperature @xmath100 .",
    "unfortunately , analysis of the transport data is not so straightforward as in the case of time - of - flight data .",
    "another important problem is the modification of the mobility field dependence for the non - gaussian dos , it will be considered in a separate paper .",
    "we consider the shape of the far tails of the dos in the models of amorphous organic materials , suitable for the description of charge carrier transport in polar and nonpolar materials ( dg or qg model , correspondingly ) .",
    "it was found that for both models the shape of the tails becomes non - gaussian , but there is a principal difference between two models : in the dg model the dos is exactly symmetric around @xmath42 while in the qg model the dos is generally asymmetric leading to the inequivalence of the energetic landscape for transport of electrons and holes .",
    "deviation of the dos shape from the gaussian one naturally leads to the alteration of the mobility temperature dependence for low temperature : the dependence @xmath7 deviates from the genuine gaussian dependence @xmath101 and becomes weaker ( see and ( [ lowt - aqg ] ) ) .",
    "observation of such dependence could be a serious argument in favor of the non - gaussian dos in the tail region .",
    "unfortunately , any feasible transport experiment should be carried out at the extremely low temperature where time - of - flight transport becomes highly dispersive even for rather thick transport layers . for the quasi - stationary methods such as celiv or space charge limited current - voltage measurements",
    "an extraction of the carrier mobility from the experimental data is not so straightforward .",
