    "the realization of spinor bose - einstein condensation in optical traps@xcite has stimulated enormous interest in magnetic properties of quantum bose gases@xcite . in optical traps , the hyperfine degree of freedom of confined atoms , such as @xmath0 ,",
    "is released and therefore the atom can exhibit magnetism . more intriguingly ,",
    "an exchange - like spin - spin interaction can be present between atoms . in the @xmath1 @xmath0 atoms ,",
    "the interaction is ferromagnetic@xcite , so the @xmath0 gas appears to be a prototype of itinerant - boson ferromagnet@xcite .",
    "ferromagnetism is one of the central research themes in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "two types of ferromagnetism have already been intensively studied : local - moment ferromagnetism and itinerant - electron ferromagnetism .",
    "although particles in these two systems obey different statistics , they both share some common features . for example",
    ", both ferromagnets have a curie point , above which the susceptibility conforms to curie - weiss law .",
    "nonetheless , from the theoretical point of view , the origin of curie - weiss law is quite different for these two systems . in insulators",
    "it is due to local thermal spin fluctuations and can be easily explained in the mean - field approximation . on the other hand , in itinerant - electron ferromagnets",
    "the curie - weiss law may be caused by the mode - mode coupling between spin fluctuations and the theoretical treatment is much more complicated  @xcite .",
    "an appropriate theory is the self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) theory  @xcite which goes beyond the hartree - fock approximation and the random - phase approximation .",
    "the scr theory succeeds in explaining various magnetic properties of itinerant - electron ferromagnets and is also extended to treat the specific heat  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 gas provides opportunity to study the third type of ferromagnetism .",
    "ho  @xcite , ohmi and machida  @xcite have studied its ground state properties and the spin - wave spectrum .",
    "the long wavelength spectrum is linear in @xmath2 , the wave vector , as in the two former cases . in our previous papers",
    ", we have investigated the finite - temperature properties , especially the curie point  @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the phase diagram in itinerant bosons should be more complicated than the other two ferromagnets , because the bose system has an intrinsic phase transition , other than the ferromagnetic transition .",
    "an interesting conclusion we arrived is that its curie point , @xmath3 , is never below the bose - einstein condensation temperature , @xmath4 , regardless of the magnitude of the ferromagnetic coupling  @xcite .",
    "kis - szabo _ et al _ got the same point later  @xcite .",
    "however , thermodynamics of the itinerant - boson ferromagnet has not yet been investigated systematically so far .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to calculate the thermodynamic quantities of ferromagnetic bosons . as in the fermion case ,",
    "the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility are of the most interest . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the mean - field approximation to deal with ferromagnetic interaction , taking the spin-1 bose gas as an example . in section 3 ,",
    "phase transitions are discussed by calculating the free energy and specific heat . in section 4 , the susceptibility above the curie point is calculated .",
    "a summary is given in the last section .",
    "the spin-1 bose gas with ferromagnetic couplings is described by the following hamiltonian , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the quantum field operator for annihilating an atom in spin state @xmath7 at site @xmath8 . for a spin-1 gas , @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 denotes the external magnetic field .",
    "the last term represents the ferromagnetic exchange between two different bosons meeting at site @xmath8 and @xmath11 is the exchange constant .",
    "@xmath12 are the spin operators , which can be expressed via the @xmath13 pauli matrices , for example , @xmath14 within the mean - field approximation , we treat the spin - dependent interactions as a molecular field except of a particle with itself , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ferromagnetic order parameter .",
    "then the effective hamiltonian for the grand canonical ensemble reads , @xmath17 \\hat n_{{\\bf k}\\sigma }     + \\frac{1}{2}\\overline{m}^2i_s n , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the kinetic energy for free particles , @xmath19 is called the molecular field , similar to the stoner theory for fermion gases@xcite ; @xmath20 is the chemical potential ; @xmath21 is the total particle number .",
    "the grand thermodynamic potential can be worked out in a standard way , @xmath22\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\frac{(k_bt)^{\\frac{5}{2}}vm^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{(2\\pi\\hbar^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\\sum_\\sigma      f_{\\frac{5}{2}}\\left ( \\frac{\\mu+\\sigma h}{k_bt } \\right )      + \\frac{1}{2}\\overline{m}^2i_s n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the mass of particle , and @xmath25 is the polylogarithm function defined by @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the mean - field self - consistent equations are derived from the grand thermodynamic potential ,    [ e - sf ] @xmath28+n_0~;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the density of particles , @xmath30 is the density of condensed one and @xmath31 is the magnetization .",
    "@xmath30 is zero unless the temperature is below the bec point @xmath32 .",
    "in our previous investigations , we showed that the system exhibits two phase transitions , the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and the ferromagnetic transition  @xcite .",
    "the condensation temperature @xmath4 and the curie temperature @xmath3 are calculated by solving the self - consistent equations .",
    "we find that @xmath3 is never below @xmath4 for all systems with a finite ferromagnetic exchange ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "however , one can get another solution to the eqs .",
    "( [ e - sf ] ) , with @xmath34 at all temperatures .",
    "it means the system does not undergo a ferromagnetic transition at all , but remains in paramagnetic ( pm ) state at low temperatures .",
    "actually , whether there exists a curie point in the ferromagnetic bose gases is still a controversial question .",
    "some researchers suppose that the bose gas can not be magnetized spontaneously at low temperatures even if the ferromagnetic exchange is present  @xcite .    .",
    "the two curves cross at the temperature @xmath35 , which is just the fm transition point.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in order to single out the physically correct solution , one has to compare the free energy of the the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state and the pm state .",
    "the relation between the free energy and the grand thermodynamic potential has the form : @xmath36 for computational convenience , the temperature @xmath37 and exchange interaction @xmath38 are re - scaled , as did in ref .",
    "[ 8 ] , by the following formula : @xmath39}^{-\\frac{2}{3}}{t}/{t_0}$ ] and @xmath40}^{-\\frac{2}{3}}i_s / ( k_b t_0 ) $ ] , where @xmath41 is the condensation temperature of ideal spin-1 bose gas .",
    "hereinafter , all the numerical results are obtained by setting @xmath42 .",
    "figure 1 shows the free energy of unit volume for the gas with @xmath43 .",
    "it shows clearly that the free energy of fm state is lower than that of the pm state at the low temperature region , which demonstrates that the fm state should be more stable than pm state .",
    "therefore , the low temperature state has a spontaneous magnetization . in experiments , the total spin of the ferromagnetic spinor condensate",
    "is observed to be conserved , which is called the _ spin conservation rule _ in some literatures  @xcite .",
    "however , the spin conservation rule holds only globally , not locally . in the theoretical treatment of ref .",
    "[ 20 ] , the spin conservation rule is imposed by introducing a lagrangian multiplier .",
    "it is overconstrained in some sense , so that the spontaneous magnetization can not be established .",
    "recent experiments and theories indicate some domain structures should be formed and each domain is magnetized  @xcite , where the conservation law for the total spin can be restored naturally .",
    "the fm transition is induced by the fm coupling and the transition temperature is about @xmath44 for the bose gas with @xmath43 .",
    "when the temperature goes down further , the bec then occurs , which is the intrinsic phase transition of bose gases . to demonstrate different features of the two transitions",
    ", we now calculate the specific heat of unit volume , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the internal energy @xmath47 as shown in fig .",
    "2 , for the system with @xmath43 , the specific heat exhibits a jump discontinuity at @xmath44 , from the pm state to the fm state .",
    "this is a characteristic feature of the landau - type of second - order phase transition . and",
    "similar behaviors have been observed in the specific heat of ferromagnetic insulators or itinerant - fermion ferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "the bec occurs at @xmath48 , where the specific exhibits a bend . but",
    "specific heat is continuous at the bec point , similar to that of a free bose gas .",
    "the results indicate that the critical behaviors are different at the two transition points on the mean - field level .     and @xmath49 .",
    "the dotted vertical lines serve to guide the eye to see the transition points.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]",
    "for a ferromagnet , the susceptibility above the curie point is of special interest .",
    "as already studied , the susceptibility is well described by curie - weiss law both in the insulating ferromagnet and the itinerant - electron ferromagnet . in this section",
    "we calculate the susceptibility for the itinerant - boson ferromagnet .",
    "the susceptibility can be derived from eqs .",
    "( [ e - sf ] ) . differentiating both sides of the two equations and removing the term @xmath50 , the following equation are deduced , @xmath51 where @xmath52\\nonumber \\\\     & & -\\left(\\frac{k_btm}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2 } }      \\frac{{\\left [ { f_{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\left ( { \\frac{{\\mu   + h}}{k_bt } }      \\right ) - f_{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\left ( { \\frac{{\\mu   - h}}{k_bt } } \\right ) }      \\right]^2 } } { { \\sum\\limits_\\sigma { f_{\\frac{1}{2 } }      \\left ( { \\frac{{\\mu   + h\\sigma } } { k_bt } } \\right ) } } } ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] above the curie point , the magnetization @xmath53 ( then @xmath54 ) diminishes correspondingly when the external field @xmath10 tends to zero .",
    "so the second term in the above equation is omitted and then @xmath25 has a simple form : @xmath55 thus the zero - field susceptibility of unit volume is given by @xmath56 the susceptibility @xmath57 is a function of the coupling @xmath38 and temperature @xmath37 .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath58 and @xmath57 versus @xmath59 at different given temperatures . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "3 , the susceptibility becomes larger as the coupling @xmath59 increasing .",
    "it is physically reasonable since the the system with larger @xmath59 can be magnetized more easily . at a given temperature ,",
    "@xmath57 diverges as @xmath59 approaches a critical value .",
    "it is worth noting that the inverse of the susceptibility is in a good linear relationship with the coupling .     and",
    "@xmath60.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    the susceptibility versus temperature is shown in fig .",
    "4 . one can immediately find that the susceptibility meet quite well with the curie - weiss law in a very large temperature region . seeing that the curie - weiss law is very difficult to be derived for the itinerant-_fermion _ ferromagnet , it is really surprising that we get it for the itinerant-_boson _ ferromagnet just based on the mean - field approximation .     and @xmath61 . , scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in order to discuss the curie - weiss law in a more explicit way",
    ", we proceed to carry out a semi - analytical calculation to deduce the linear dependence of @xmath58 on the temperature .",
    "the first step is to analyze the temperature dependence of @xmath25 .",
    "it is quite complicated , because the chemical potential @xmath20 is an implicit function of the temperature .",
    "we consider a limit case that the parameter @xmath38 is quite small , when @xmath62 is close to @xmath32 .",
    "so @xmath20 is close to zero in the vicinity of @xmath62 .",
    "according to the asymptotic behavior of the polylogarithm function : @xmath63 and @xmath64 as @xmath65 , we get the following equations from eqs .",
    "( 7a ) and ( 13 ) respectively , @xmath66.\\ ] ] and @xmath67 substitute eqs .",
    "( [ e15 ] ) and ( [ e16 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ e14 ] ) , we get @xmath68 in the vicinity of @xmath3 which is only slightly larger than @xmath69 , eq . ( [ e17 ] ) could be further simplified to @xmath70~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the effective fm transition temperature is defined as @xmath71 so far the curie - weiss law is derived .",
    "we note that the derivation is only valid in small @xmath38 cases .    in the high temperature limit , one can also easily prove that @xmath72 is linearly dependant on @xmath37 .",
    "in this case , @xmath73 has a quite large value , so that @xmath74 according to eq .",
    "( 6 ) . combining eqs .",
    "( 7a ) , ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) , it yields @xmath75 we estimate this equation holds in the range of @xmath76 .",
    "in summary , we calculate thermodynamic quantities of the spinor bose gas with ferromagnetic interactions . such kind of investigations has already been performed intensively for the ferromagnetic fermions , while few as yet for bosons .",
    "based on a mean - field approximation , we show that the system undergos a ferromagnetic phase transition first , then the bose - einstein condensation with the temperature decreasing .",
    "the specific heat shows a jump discontinuity at the curie point and a bend at the bose - einstein condensation temperature , indicating that critical behaviors are different near the two transition .",
    "the more surprising result is that the mean - field theory yield the magnetic susceptibility which satisfies perfectly the curie - weiss law over a wide range of temperature .",
