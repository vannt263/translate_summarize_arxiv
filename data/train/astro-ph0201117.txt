    "light bending by gravity is a classical effect of general relativity ( e.g. misner , thorne , & wheeler 1973 ) . in a spherically symmetric gravitational field ,",
    "the exact bending angle is given by an elliptic integral ( see appendix ) .",
    "the effect plays important role in astrophysics ; e.g. weak bending gives rise to the gravitational lensing phenomenon .",
    "strong bending occurs near compact objects ( black holes and neutron stars ) and crucially affects their emission .    in this letter",

    "we apply this formula to neutron stars and develop a new simple formalism for the light bending effects in pulsars .",
    "we illustrate with pulsars that have two point - like antipodal spots emitting thermal radiation , and compare the results with the exact theory ( pechenick , ftaclas , & cohen 1983 ) .",
    "the advantage of our formalism is that it gives a clear understanding of the bending effects and describes them analytically with almost no losses of accuracy as long as stars with @xmath12 are considered .",
