    "significantly deeper observations were later obtained in 2006 february as part of the irac gto program ( program i d 520 ) .",

    "the data were reduced following standard procedures ( @xcite ) , and source flux densities were measured with psf fitting .",
    "the 99% confidence region of ssg  1 contains two visible - wavelength sources .",
    "the new 24@xmath0 m imaging shows that the source chosen as the most likely submm counterpart by @xcite is responsible for @xmath575% of the 24@xmath0 m emission .",
    "the _ spitzer_/irs observation of ssg  1 was designed according to the recommended ssc set - up . for each slit , there were six pointings along the slit at 24  spacing , all centered on the slit in its narrow dimension .",
    "this is equivalent to the normal point source method except that the target is observed in six different slit positions instead of the usual two , lessening the effects of flat - fielding errors and bad pixels . in 3.1 hours ( the total for the aor , including peakups and overheads ) , there were five cycles of ll1 ( 19.538.0@xmath0 m ) and seven of ll2 ( 14.021.3@xmath0 m ) with 120s ramps at each of the six slit positions .",
    "the data were reduced using the pipeline s15 , cleaned using irsclean , and extracted with smart ( @xcite ) .",
    "two extraction techniques were compared : the first method involved extracting the spectra from the individual images and taking the median spectrum ; the second method was to align the images , and then extract the spectrum .",
    "there was little difference in the final spectrum using either technique , and the spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the most prominent features in the ssg  1 spectrum are due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) . for quantitative analysis",
    ", pah can be measured from integrating the flux above a baseline , but this method tends to underestimate the flux density as compared to a profile decomposition method such as the one used by pahfit ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for more detailed consideration of the two approaches ) .",
    "while both methods give similar pah ratios and similar spatial variations of pah strengths , absolute flux densities will differ due to assumptions about the pah profiles .",
    "the additional deep 24@xmath0 m and 1.4ghz imaging of the botes field yielded counterparts in these bands for ssg  1 and 2 with low probabilities of chance association ( @xcite ) .",
    "the more precise positions were then used to identify optical and mid - ir counterparts .",
    "finding counterparts for the three sources in the lockman hole is not straightforward : figure  [ fig : lhstamp ] shows thumbnail images of the fields at various wavelengths . as can be seen , there exist multiple radio detections for two of the 350@xmath0 m objects .",
    "however the _ most likely _ counterparts can be determined with the following rationale :    * lh 350.1 : the 1.4ghz image shows two potential counterparts , but only the southern one is within the 9  sharc  ii beam . in the visible images this appears to be a blend of two sources .",
    "the photometric redshift for this southerly source was obtained using hyper - z ( @xcite ) in conjunction with the @xmath21[3.6][4.5 ] photometry , similar to the approach of @xcite .",
    "the best - fitting solution is a starburst template at @xmath22 .",
    "the northern 1.4ghz object is not associated with any visible - light detection , although it is prominent in the irac and mips images .",
    "those images also show two more sources : an easterly object whose sed suggests it is a star or a low redshift elliptical galaxy , and well to the west , the qso rds 054a at @xmath23 ( @xcite ) , which is not expected to make a strong contribution to the 350@xmath0 m emission .",
    "* lh 350.2 : the 1.4ghz image shows three sources within the beam .",
    "however , the two outermost objects are well - resolved in the visible imaging , suggesting that they are likely to be relatively nearby .",
    "photo - z fitting puts both at @xmath24 , and sed template fitting puts a contribution to the 350@xmath0 m emission of @xmath2520% ( assuming a dust temperature , @xmath26k ) .",
    "therefore , the very red middle object is likely to be the predominant source of the 350@xmath0 m emission with a best - fitting photo - z of 1.21@xmath27 . *",
    "lh 350.3 : there is a strong 24@xmath0 m and weak 1.4ghz source within 6  of the 350@xmath0 m position .",
    "the @xmath14 through 4.5@xmath0 m images suggest that the mid - ir flux is a combination of two sources with the radio position lining up on the redder , western object .",
    "best - fitting photometric redshifts are @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the western and eastern objects respectively . there remains the possibility of a merging system because the secondary solution for the eastern source is @xmath30 . based on the radio identification , the western object is taken as the main source of the submillimeter emission .",
    "[ subsec : lh ]    [ subsec : sed ]",
    "the multiwavelength photometry in table  [ tab : phot ] was used to derive photometric redshifts and thermal emission parameters . following the same approach as @xcite ,",
    "the stardust2 template fit was used ( @xcite ) to simultaneously obtain the photometric redshift @xmath31 , dust temperature @xmath32 , and the 81000@xmath0 m ir luminosity @xmath33 .",
    "templates were based on local starbursts , and @xmath34 was minimised through a levenberg - marquardt technique . for ssg  1 ,",
    "the redshift obtained for the irs spectrum in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] was used in the fit , but @xmath35 agrees well with the @xmath36 from the template fitting .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table [ tab : stardust2 ] , and the best - fitting templates shown in figure  [ fig : sedtemplates ] .    for ssg  1 , ssg  2 , and lh 350.3 the 350@xmath0 m flux density is well fit by the template , but in the cases of lh 350.2 and 3 , the quality of the fit at 350@xmath0 m is clearly affected by the longer submillimeter data , which constrain the slope on the rayleigh - jeans side of the spectrum . additionally , the 24@xmath0 m flux density is useful in determining which side of the peak the 350@xmath0 m datapoint lies .",
    "usually the mid - ir is not used to constrain the restframe far - ir continuum emission because specific dust grains and agn can have a major effect on mid - ir flux densities .",
    "usage of the mips band was checked for a sample of smgs ( from @xcite ) by comparing template fits using measurements at 350@xmath0 m , 850@xmath0 m , and radio with measurements at 24@xmath0 m , 350@xmath0 m , and radio plus long - submillimeter limits .",
    "the two approaches agree within the stardust2 uncertainties .",
    "this indicates our thermal parameters are not noticeably biased by the inclusion of the mid - ir data .",
    "( see @xcite for more details . )    for lh 350.3 , the lack of a defining 1.6@xmath0 m rest - frame stellar continuum feature makes a significant agn contribution plausible , although the relatively low radio flux density would argue against this .",
    "because of the absence of agn templates in stardust2 , the lh  350.3 data were also fit using another routine with a mixture of agn and starburst templates ( @xcite ) . in this template fit ,",
    "the favoured solution is a starburst at @xmath37 ( but without including the radio flux density ) .",
    "therefore we consider lh 350.3 to be , like the rest of this sample , predominantly star - forming . given the photometric redshift estimates from hyper - z , stardust2 , and @xcite , it is possible that lh 350.3 is the most distant galaxy so far discovered at short - submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : sedtemplates ] , all five sources are well fit in the mid - ir by templates that include features associated with star formation , i.e. , a rest - frame 1.6@xmath0 m stellar continuum bump and apparent pah emission . for ssg  1 ,",
    "the presence of pah is confirmed by the mid - ir spectrum , shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "an emission line from [ ] is likely present though blended with possible pah emission at 12.7  .",
    "the dust continuum is relatively flat until ( rest wavelength ) @xmath515.5@xmath0 m .",
    "although the 9.7@xmath0 m silicate absorption is relatively weak , it is within the range seen in local ir - luminous galaxies .",
    "table [ tab : spectrum ] gives the emission feature fluxes , and a standard template ( iras 22491@xmath381808 , an ir - luminous galaxy with moderately strong pah emission ) was used to obtain an overall best - fitting redshift from the spectral features of 1.05@xmath130.01 .",
    "the values of @xmath39 for the 7.7 and 11.3@xmath0 m rest - frame emission ( 6.8 and 2.0@xmath4010@xmath41 ) are consistent with the @xmath39 vs @xmath33 distribution of @xcite for a sample of 850@xmath0m - selected smgs .",
    "( this comparison used the integrated line flux densities with the @xmath33 given in table  [ tab : stardust2 ] ) .",
    "the 7.7@xmath0 m pah luminosity also provides an estimate of the star formation rate ( sfr ) of 340yr@xmath42 following the relation given by @xcite .",
    "given the strong star - forming features in the mid - ir spectrum , this compares favorably with the sfr derived from @xmath33 of 136yr@xmath42 following the relation given by @xcite .",
    "the different survey depths make it complicated to produce fair statistics for number counts .",
    "the lockman hole surveys @xcite were targeted at known sources , and sensitivity for serendipitous sources varied with distance from the target source .",

    "this fraction is reasonable given that the bulk of the background will be generated by galaxies near the break in the differential counts .",
    "it is also consistent with the 30% estimate at @xmath45mjy from the source counts of @xcite .",
    "a lower limit on the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) can be found using the thermal parameters in table  [ tab : stardust2 ] and the comoving volume in @xmath1 .",
    "the conversion from far - ir luminosity to sfr is given by @xcite .",
    "the result for this epoch is 0.017m@xmath46yr@xmath42mpc@xmath47 , much lower than the values presented by @xcite .",
    "this implies the bulk of the 350@xmath0 m contribution to the star formation rate density is from less luminous infrared galaxies and normal galaxies , consistent with observations of ir - luminous galaxies in different bands ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the predictions from source count models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "deeper 8001000  imaging ( e.g. , with alma  @xcite ) of the 350  -selected population would provide a more direct direct comparison of any selection biases .",
    "mid - ir surveys to probe the @xmath1 galaxy population have the advantage of better angular resolution , aiding counterpart identification ( and hence more reliable redshift estimation ) , but a significant disadvantage is that without further far - ir observations , constraints on the rest - frame far - ir thermal emission must be indirectly inferred .",
    "the 350:24 flux density  redshift distribution for the sharc  ii 350@xmath0m - selected smgs compared with the 850 and 1100@xmath0m - selected smgs is shown in figure  [ fig : col ] alongside colors from various templates from @xcite .",
    "the overall distribution suggests that all samples are drawn from the same ir - luminous galaxy population , and the good agreement with the templates suggests these are predominantly luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies .  and",
    "@xmath49  respectively . ]",
    "studies of infrared galaxies are often limited by unavailability of data at wavelengths longer than 24 . in such cases ,",
    "the ir luminosity can be estimated using only the 24@xmath0 m flux density and various sed templates ( @xcite ) combined with an estimated redshift . for the smg samples",
    ", the thermal emission estimates found this way compare surprisingly well with those from stardust2 for @xmath50 as shown in figure  [ fig : ir24 ] .",
    "for these galaxies , the dominant errors on both luminosity predictors will arise from the photo-@xmath17 fitting ; these errors are highly non - gaussian and non - trivial to determine . to some extent",
    ", the agreement in figure  [ fig : ir24 ] can be attributed to small number statistics and selection . the overall variation in the ratio over a wider redshift range",
    "could also imply a heterogenous smg population .",
    "this would be consistent with the color in figure  [ fig : col ] but with a varying degree of agn contribution .",
    "another condition on this sample is the requirement of bright optical , mid - ir , and most importantly radio identifications ; at high redshift , an agn will boost the radio flux density and the emission in other bands ( notably in the mid - ir ) , allowing this type of analysis to be performed",
    ". however none of the sources in the sample appears to be strongly affected by an agn . at higher redshifts",
    "multiwavelength analysis becomes much more difficult .",
    "some of the higher-@xmath17 850/1100@xmath0 m galaxies could simply have incorrectly identified 24@xmath0 m counterparts ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the restframe 12@xmath0 m flux density has been suggested to be a `` pivot point '' for seds ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , giving a fixed @xmath51 for both starbursts and agn .",
    "this correlation was determined from local _ iras _ sources , but at @xmath52 , the rest frame 12@xmath0 m is shifted into the 24@xmath0 m band , and thus the relation at this redshift can be examined directly by our sample .",
    "we expect this relation to hold if the populations are similar .",
    "an observed difference in the populations is that distant mid - ir sources show stronger dust grain emission features around 12@xmath0 m compared to the local ir - luminous galaxy population .",
    "this difference could be due to differing agn fractions @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : spin ] shows the ratio of far - ir luminosity to observed _ spitzer_/mips 24@xmath0 m monochromatic luminosity as a function of redshift .",
    "the ratio flattens out at @xmath52 as the rest frame 12@xmath0 m emission is shifted into the mips 24@xmath0 m band , but the dispersion increases at higher redshift .",
    "this suggests that the local empirical far - ir/12@xmath0 m relation could apply to earlier epochs where the galaxy is undergoing rapid evolution , making rest - frame 12@xmath0 m flux densities a better tracer of ir luminosity @xcite than other mid - ir emission features , e.g. , 7.7@xmath0 m pah selected at @xmath4 . at @xmath53 the silicate absorption feature is redshifted into the mips 24@xmath0 m band and affects the flux density measurement .",
    "this effect is emphasized in figure  [ fig : col ] , where an excess in the 350/24@xmath0 m colours is evident in the model seds , and galaxies in the redshift range where the silicate feature would cause a deficit in the 24@xmath0 m flux ( @xmath54 ) are notably absent from figure [ fig : spin ] .",
    "various studies have suggested that the far - ir luminosity can be deduced solely from mid - ir observations of galaxies . @xcite",
    "have shown that the far - ir luminosity of dusty galaxies observed with _ spitzer _",
    "correlate closely with the corresponding 8 and 24@xmath0 m mid - ir luminosities .",
    "these studies were limited to redshifts @xmath55 by the necessity to use _",
    "bands at 70 and 160@xmath0 m to calculate the far - ir luminosity .",
    "the mid - ir to far - ir luminosity relation was tentatively extended to higher redshifts ( @xmath4 ) by stacking the far - infrared fluxes in the long wavelength _",
    "bands , and these stacked results were used by @xcite to calculate the bolometric luminosity function at @xmath56 . in contrast , our submillimeter observations directly access the high redshift universe without the need for stacking images to obtain far - infrared fluxes . from figure",
    "[ fig : spin ] we observe a tight correlation between the far and mid - ir flux densities in our sample between @xmath2 , but there is a large dispersion in the infrared colours at @xmath57 . for @xmath57 , the 24@xmath0 m band is sampling rest wavelengths shorter than 8@xmath0",

    "<S> the sample includes galaxies discovered in the deepest blank - field survey at 350@xmath0 m ( in the botes deep field ) and also later serendipitous detections in the lockman hole . in determining multiwavelength identifications , the 350@xmath0 m position and map resolution of the second generation submillimeter high angular resolution camera ( sharc  ii ) are critical , especially in the cases where multiple radio sources exist and the 24@xmath0 m counterparts are unresolved . </S>",
    "<S> spectral energy distribution templates are fit to identified counterparts , and the sample is found to comprise ir - luminous galaxies at @xmath1 predominantly powered by star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the first spectrum of a 350@xmath0m - selected galaxy provides an additional confirmation , showing prominent dust grain features typically associated with star - forming galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> compared to submillimeter galaxies selected at 850 and 1100@xmath0 m , galaxies selected at 350  have a similar range of far - infrared color temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> however , no 350@xmath0m - selected sources are reliably detected at 850 or 1100@xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies in our sample with redshifts @xmath2 show a tight correlation between the far- and mid - infrared flux densities , but galaxies at higher redshifts show a large dispersion in their mid- to far - infrared colors . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a limit to which the mid - ir emission traces the far - ir emission in star - forming galaxies .    the 350@xmath0 m flux densities ( @xmath3mjy ) place these objects near the _ herschel_/spire 350@xmath0 m confusion threshold , with the lower limit on the star formation rate density suggesting the bulk of the 350@xmath0 m contribution will come from less luminous infrared sources and normal galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the nature of the dominant source of the 350@xmath0 m background  star - forming galaxies in the epoch of peak star formation in the universe  could be more effectively probed using ground - based instruments with their angular resolution and sensitivity offering significant advantages over space - based imaging . </S>"
