    "empirical knowledge of the inclusive electron - deuteron cross section in the nucleon resonance region is important input for many research activities in nuclear and particle physics .",
    "the most important examples include calculations of radiative corrections to cross sections , extractions of spin structure functions from asymmetry measurements , determinations of structure function moments , and determinations of the vector coupling in models of low energy neutrino - nucleon cross sections .",
    "the latter is of particular importance since the quality of low energy neutrino - nucleon cross section models will become one of the largest uncertainties in the extraction of neutrino oscillation parameters from future long - baseline experiments .    in this paper",
    "we will describe a fit to precision electron - deuteron inelastic cross sections in the resonance region for negative four - momentum transfer @xmath6  @xmath7  10  @xmath8 and final state invariant mass @xmath2 gev . among the advantages over previous fits  @xcite are : inclusion of photoproduction and low @xmath9 data points ; inclusion of several new experimental results ; and the bulk of underlying fit is to the free nucleon ( average of free proton and neutron ) , with fermi motion consistently taken into account in a plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) .",
    "the latter provides for a parameter - free way of describing the broadening of resonance peaks with increasing three - momentum @xmath10 .",
    "the average nucleon transverse cross section fit form is the same as the recent fit to electron - proton data of ref .",
    "@xcite , which uses a set of threshold - dependent breit - wigner forms for all resonances .",
    "the principal difference is that the present fit is to the transverse portion of the cross section only , due to a lack of sufficient virtual photon polarization @xmath11 range in the presently available deuteron data set .",
    "the assumption was made that the ratio of longitudinal to transverse cross sections , @xmath12 , is the same for the free proton and neutron , as supported by a recent analysis of data with @xmath13 gev  @xcite , and also supported by the limited study of the present analysis . with the above assumptions ,",
    "the `` dip '' region between the quasi - elastic peak and the @xmath5 resonance is under - predicted at low @xmath9 , possibly because meson exchange currents ( mec ) and final state interactions ( fsi ) have been ignored  @xcite .",
    "an additional empirical function was used to fill in the missing strength in the `` dip '' region .",
    "the overall structure of the fit can be summarized as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the transverse cross section for a deuteron , @xmath16 is the dip region parametrization ( 6 free parameters ) , and the integral is over fermi momentum @xmath17 of the average free nucleon transverse cross section @xmath18 ( 36 free parameters ) . by simplifying the 3-dimensional integration to a 1-dimensional integration along the direction of the virtual photon , it was possible to simultaneously fit all 42 parameters in a single gradient search minimization .",
    "the minimization was done with respect to an ensemble of approximately 15,000 data points from 9 experiments .",
    "the following section defines terms and kinematic variables .",
    "section iii describes the data sets used .",
    "section iv gives details of the functional form used for @xmath16 and @xmath18 , and how the fermi - smearing integral was simplified .",

    "all the hadronic structure information is contained in @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which are only dependent on @xmath31 and @xmath9 .",

    "we use the subscripts @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 to refer to proton , neutron , average nucleon , and deuteron respectively , where the deuteron cross sections are defined to be per nucleon rather than per nucleus , following the high energy convention .",
    "we define @xmath37",
    "the characteristics of the data sets used in the fit are summarized in table  [ table_dataset ] . the first reference ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) includes results from three early photoproduction experiments .",
    "we only used data from these experiments with beam energies above 800 mev , because at lower energies the more recent photoproduction data of daphne  @xcite has significantly smaller systematic errors .",
    "the jlab clas data  @xcite cover a wide kinematic range with many data points .",
    "the data are reported as values of the structure function @xmath38 , averaged over two different beam energies . since the relative weight from the two beam energies ( with differing values of @xmath11 )",
    "was not given , there is a systematic error in the conversion to @xmath39 that was taken into account in the total error bars .",
    "the early jlab hall c data of niculescu  @xcite cover a similar kinematic range as the clas data , with less data points but smaller statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the more recent jlab hall c data of e00 - 116  @xcite cover the high @xmath9 range with relatively few data points , which nonetheless have very small statistical and systematic errors ( typically a few percent ) . to extend the low @xmath31 region to even higher @xmath9 ,",
    "although with larger relative errors , we included the data of slac e133  @xcite . to cover the lower @xmath9 region ,",
    "we included preliminary data from two jlab hall c experiments : e02 - 109@xmath40  @xcite and e00 - 002  @xcite .",
    "these experiments cover a wide range of @xmath11 for each @xmath41 point with small statistical errors .",

    "this missing strength could be due to mec and fsi in either quasi - elastic or inelastic scattering . whatever the physical cause , we chose a purely empirical form that greatly improved the fit quality .",
    "this dip region additive correction term is given by : @xmath43}/(1 + { \\rm max}(0.3,q^2)/1.265)^8\\ ] ] the unit - less structure function @xmath44 is related to @xmath39 by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the results of the deuteron fit are shown at seven representative values of @xmath9 as a function of @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , along with the 1-@xmath47 error band . in order to span a smaller range on the vertical axis , we plot @xmath44 rather than @xmath39 .",
    "note that the resonant structure , clearly visible at low @xmath9 , is essentially gone for @xmath48 gev@xmath1 , due to the increasing influence of fermi broadening and non - resonant background contributions .",
    "ratios of cross sections for each data point to the corresponding fit value are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] as a function of @xmath31 for six bins in @xmath9 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , 96% of the points lie within 10% of the fit , 76% lie within 5% , and 53% lie within 3% .",
    "overall , the agreement of data and fit is reasonably good at the 3% to 5% level .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] that there are two noticeable oscillations in the ratios at low @xmath31 and @xmath9 : this trend is also seen in the proton fit of ref .",
    "this may indicate the need for additional parameters to describe the photoproduction and very low @xmath9 data . in order to check the assumption that @xmath4 , the data with @xmath49 are plotted in gray ( blue online ) , while those with @xmath50 are plotted in black .",
    "no glaring discrepancy is seen between these two data sets .",
    "a more refined analysis will be performed once the preliminary data of jlab e02 - 109  @xcite and e00 - 002  @xcite are finalized , and results from the very recent jlab e06 - 009  @xcite experiment become available .",
    "the e02 - 109 and e06 - 009 experiments were specifically designed to measure @xmath51 , and cover a large range of @xmath11 at many specific values of @xmath41 .    the ratio of the commonly - used fit of niculescu  @xcite to the present fit are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "that fit tends to systematically lie above the data in the resonance region ( @xmath52 gev ) , and lies well below data at high @xmath31 and low @xmath9 ( outside the kinematic range of that fit ) .",
    "since the present underlying fit is to the average free nucleon , we can use the proton fit  @xcite to obtain predictions for the ratio of neutron to proton transverse cross sections ( or equivalently the ratio @xmath53 ) , as illustrated in fig.[fig : fig4]a .",
    "significant resonance structure is predicted , especially at low @xmath9 and in the region of the @xmath5 resonance , for which the resonant contribution to @xmath53 is expected to be unity by isospin invariance .",
    "these predictions can be tested against the anticipated results of the jlab `` bonus '' experiment  @xcite , which used tagging of low energy backward protons to `` tag '' spectator protons in electron - deuteron scattering ( and hence isolate electron - neutron scattering ) . predicted ratios of @xmath54 that could be extracted from bonus are shown in fig.[fig : fig4]b at three representative values of @xmath9 .",
    "an empirical fit to inelastic electron - deuteron scattering has been performed which describes available data reasonably well ( 3% to 5% level ) in nearly all of the kinematic range than can be accessed at jefferson lab with up to 6 gev electrons and photons : @xmath0 gev@xmath1 and @xmath2 gev .",
    "the fit is useful in the evaluation of radiative corrections to experimental data , for extraction of spin structure functions from asymmetry measurements , and for the evaluation of structure function moments .",
    "since the underlying fit is to an average nucleon , the results can be combined with a proton fit  @xcite to obtain predictions for electron - neutron scattering in the resonance region .",
    "suitably corrected for fermi motion , these can in turn be used to make neutron excess corrections to nuclear structure functions .",
    "once the data from jlab e02 - 109  @xcite , e00 - 002  @xcite , and jlab e06 - 009  @xcite are finalized , we plan to re - do the fit for @xmath55 and @xmath39 separately , rather than making the assumption @xmath4 .",
    "we also plan to use the results of the bonus  @xcite experiment , which to first order will measure the ratio of electron - neutron to electron - deuteron scattering .",
    "fortran computer code embodying the electron - deuteron fit described in this article is available by email request from the authors .",
    "the code includes the fit covariance matrix ( or error matrix ) , and a subroutine to obtain the error on @xmath56 .",
    "the code also includes the proton fit of ref .",
    "@xcite , permitting the determination of electron - neutron cross sections from the deuteron and proton fits .",
    "the same code also includes a simple fermi - smearing model of electron - nucleus cross sections for @xmath57 , using these deuteron and proton fits , as described in ref .  @xcite . the quasi - elastic model described in the appendix",
    "is also included .",
    "this work was supported in part by research grants 0099540 and 9633750 from the national science foundation .",
    "the southeastern universities research association ( sura ) operated the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility for the united states department of energy under contract de - ac05 - 84er40150 .",
    "to model quasi - elastic scattering , we used the same pwia fermi - smearing prescription ( based on the deuteron paris wave function ) as for inelastic scattering , except that the continuous inelastic cross section was replaced by a @xmath58-function elastic cross at @xmath42 .",
    "the elastic cross section was calculated using the nucleon form factors of bosted  @xcite , modified for off - shell effects using the prescription of ref .",

    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qe ] , the model works reasonably well near the quasi - elastic peak at two values of @xmath9 .",
