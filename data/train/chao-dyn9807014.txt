    "to study the complexity of continuous , or discrete , dynamical systems , a large number of concepts have been introduced @xcite .",
    "a non exhaustive list includes the kolmogorov - sinai metric entropy  @xcite , the adler - konheim - mcandrew topological entropy  @xcite , the arnold complexity  @xcite , the lyapounov characteristic exponents , the various fractal dimensions , @xcite the feigenbaum s numbers of period - doubling cascades  @xcite , @xmath0 .",
    "many authors have tried to study and discuss the relations between these various notions in an abstract framework  @xcite .",
    "inequalities have been shown , for instance the metric entropy is bounded by the topological entropy , let us also mention the kaplan - yorke relation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many specific dynamical systems have been introduced enabling to see these notions at work .",
    "some of the most popular are the lorentz system  @xcite , the baker map  @xcite , the logistic map  @xcite , the henon map  @xcite .",
    "each of these systems has been useful to understand and exemplify the previous complexity measures .    here",
    ", we introduce another two - parameter family of mapping of two variables , originating from lattice statistical mechanics for which much can be said .",
    "in particular , we will conjecture an exact algebraic value for the exponential of the topological entropy and arnold complexity .",
    "furthermore , these two measures of complexity are found to be equal for all the values of the two parameters , generic or not ( the notion of genericity is explained below ) .",
    "a fundamental distinction must be made between the previously mentioned complexity measures according to their invariance under certain classes of transformations .",
    "one should distinguish , at least , two different sets of complexity measures , the ones which are invariant under the larger classes of variables transformations , like the _ topological entropy _ or the _ arnold complexity _",
    "@xcite , and the other measures of complexity which also have invariance properties , but under a `` less larger '' set of transformations , and are therefore more sensitive to the details of the mapping ( for instance they will depend on the metric ) .",
    "we now introduce the following two parameters family of birational transformations @xmath1 : @xmath2 which can also be written projectively :    @xmath3    as far as complexity calculations are concerned , the @xmath4 case is singled out . in that case , it is convenient to use a change of variables ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) to get the very simple form @xmath5 : @xmath6 or on its homogeneous counterpart : @xmath7 these transformations derive from a transformation acting on a @xmath8 matrices @xmath9  @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 permutes the entries @xmath12 with @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the homogeneous inverse : @xmath15 .",
    "transformations of this type , generated by the composition of permutations of the entries and matrix inverse , naturally emerge in the analysis of lattice statistical mechanics symmetries  @xcite .",
    "the correspondence  @xcite between transformations @xmath16 and @xmath1 , more specifically between @xmath17 and @xmath1 , is given in appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "it will be shown below that , beyond this correspondence , @xmath17 and @xmath1 share properties concerning the complexity .",
    "transformation @xmath16 is homogeneous and of degree @xmath18 in the @xmath19 homogeneous entries .",
    "when performing the @xmath20 iterate one expects a growth of the degree of each entries as @xmath21 .",
    "it turns out that , at each step of the iteration , some factorization of all the entries occurs .",
    "the common factor can be factorized out in each entry leading to a reduced matrix @xmath22 , which is taken as the representent of the @xmath20 iterate in the projective space .",
    "due to these factorizations the growth of the calculation is not @xmath21 but rather @xmath23 where generically @xmath24 is the largest root of @xmath25 ( i.e. 1.46557123 @xmath26 )  @xcite .",
    "we call @xmath24 the complexity growth or simply the complexity .",
    "this result is a consequence of a _",
    "stable factorization scheme _ given in appendix [ appendixb ] , from which two generating functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be constructed . generating function",
    "@xmath27 keeps track respectively of the degrees of the determinants of the successive reduced matrices and @xmath28 of the degrees of the successive common factors .",
    "the function @xmath27 should not be confused with the parameter @xmath29 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath24 is the inverse of the pole of @xmath28 ( or @xmath27 ) of smallest modulus .",
    "the algebraicity of the complexity is , in fact , a straight consequence of the rationality of functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 with integer coefficients  @xcite .",
    "the same calculations have also been performed on transformations eq .",
    "( [ uv ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ uvt ] ) . in that case",
    ", factorizations also occur at each step , and generating functions can be calculated .",
    "these generating functions are , of course , different from the generating functions for @xmath30 ( see  @xcite ) but they have the _ same _ poles , and consequently the same complexity growth .",
    "one sees that , remarkably , the complexity @xmath24 does not depend on the birational representation considered : @xmath17 for any value of @xmath31 , @xmath1 or the homogeneous transformation eq .",
    "( [ uvt ] )",
    ". it will be usefull to define some degree generating functions @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the degree of some quantities we look at , at each iteration step ( numerators or denominators of the two components of @xmath35 , degree of the entries of the `` reduced '' matrices @xmath22 s , degree of the extracted polynomials @xmath36 s in appendix [ appendixb ] ... ) .",
    "the complexity growth @xmath24 is the inverse of the pole of smallest modulus of any of these degree generating functions @xmath37 : @xmath38      in the @xmath40 case , which corresponds to a codimension one variety of the parameter space ( see appendix [ appendixa ] and [ appendixc ] ) , additional factorizations occur reducing further the growth of the complexity .",
    "the generating functions are modified and the new complexity is given , for @xmath16 , by the equation : @xmath41 i.e. @xmath42 . for @xmath43 , which corresponds to @xmath17 , the equation reads : @xmath44 leading to the complexity @xmath45 .",
    "not surprisingly , the complexity of the mappings @xmath46 for @xmath4 ( see ( [ uv ] ) ) and mapping @xmath43 ( see ( [ yz ] ) ) , are the same : complexity @xmath24 corresponds to the asymptotic behavior of the degree of the successive quantities encountered in the iteration ( see ( [ lambda ] ) ) .",
    "clearly , this behavior remains unchanged under simple changes of variables . note that this complexity growth analysis can be performed directly on transformation @xmath47 , or on its homogeneous counterpart eq .",

    "conversely , all these calculations can be seen as a handy way of calculating the arnold complexity .",
    "all these considerations allow us to design a semi - numerical method to get the value of the complexity growth @xmath24 for any value of the parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the idea is to iterate , with ( [ yz ] ) ( or ( [ uv ] ) ) , a generic _ rational _ initial point @xmath49 and to follow the magnitude of the successive numerators and denominators . during the first few steps , some accidental simplifications may occur , but , after this transient regime , the integer denominators ( for instance ) grow like @xmath23 where @xmath50 is the number of iterations .",
    "typically , a best fit of the logarithm of the numerator as a linear function of @xmath50 , between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , gives the value of @xmath24 within an accuracy of @xmath53 .",
    "an integrable mapping corresponds to a polynomial growth of the calculations : the value of the complexity @xmath24 has to be numerically very close to @xmath54 .",
