    "it is possible that the successful quantum theory of gravity will require a modification of general relativity or quantum theory and that at least one of the two is not fundamental but rather only an effective , emergent theory .",
    "almost all approaches to quantum gravity leave quantum theory intact and the suspicion is largely on general relativity being the effective theory . establishing this is , however , a major challenge .",
    "general relativity describes gravitation as the curvature of spacetime by energy and matter , which means that , if it is only an effective theory , then spacetime must be just an effective description of something more fundamental .",
    "the trouble with this is that most of known physics is formulated in terms of a spacetime geometry .    in approaches where general relativity is considered fundamental enough to hope to obtain a quantum theory of gravity by its quantization ( such as causal dynamical triangulations @xcite , loop quantum gravity @xcite , spin foam models @xcite and group field theory @xcite )",
    ", one needs a mechanism to generate a nearly - flat , classical geometry in the low - energy limit , complete with local observables , to compare theory with experiment .",
    "while progress has been made in such approaches , there are still open questions . in approaches with extra dimensions",
    ", one would like an explanation for why some dimensions are large and others small @xcite . in the realm of emergent gravity approaches , we encounter theories that are formulated in terms of quantum fields on a given geometry ( this includes condensed - matter and analog approaches @xcite , matrix models @xcite and certain formulations of string theory @xcite ) .",
    "the evidence for emergent gravity is , for example , in the form of a spin-2 field , an effective metric , or the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) duality @xcite . inspecting these approaches , however , we find that it is unclear to what extent the geometry used in the initial formulation and its symmetries enter the results .",
    "is the initial fixed geometry an auxiliary structure or does it have a physical meaning ?",
    "a related issue is the notion of locality in a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "locality is a universal property of known physics so it is natural that we have also been looking for a local quantum theory of gravity .",
    "however , there are a number of indications that this may not be correct ( a thorough investigation of this question can be found in @xcite ) . in addition",
    ", some of the main obstacles we encounter in approaches to quantum gravity can be traced to the problem of constructing local observables that quantum gravity inherits from general relativity : there are no local diffeomorphism - invariant observables for pure gravity @xcite .",
    "this problem has become more prominent in recent years because its resolution is necessary to compare theory to experiment .",
    "we believe the question of locality should be addressed by emergent gravity approaches .",
    "one may be justified to expect that , if gravity and geometry are emergent , so must be locality .",
    "a condensed - matter approach to the problem of emergent geometry has recently been proposed through a model called _ quantum graphity _ @xcite . in that model ,",
    "states of the system are supported on the complete graph @xmath2 on @xmath3 vertices in which every two vertices are connected by an edge .",
    "quantum degrees of freedom are associated with edges of the graph : there is a state for each edge which signifies that the edge is turned off and other states which indicate that the edge is on .",
    "thus , the states of the complete system include every possible graph on @xmath0 vertices .",
    "the model describes a _ dynamical graph _ as the answer to the question of whether two vertices in the graph are adjacent or not can vary in time .    at high energy , there is no notion of geometry , dimension or topology in the system . at low energy , however , the system is expected to become ordered in such a way that the subgraph of @xmath2 consisting of the `` on '' edges can be described in terms of a low - dimensional spacetime manifold . near this ground state , the model is closely related to the string - net model of levin and wen @xcite which has emergent @xmath1 gauge degrees of freedom coupled to massive charge particles .",
    "the transition process from high to low temperature , called _ geometrogenesis _ , establishes an emergent notion of locality in the low - energy regime .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the model is not `` nonlocal '' in the sense of adding nonlocal corrections to a local theory .    in this paper",
    "we present a slightly modified and simplified version of the quantum graphity model .",
    "compared to the original model , the version in this paper has a reduced state space associated with each edge .",
    "this allows us to better concentrate on the structural properties of the graph at low energies .",
    "the dynamics of the model is also somewhat different from the original so that there is more natural accommodation of features of the graph such as counting of closed paths . for a certain set of parameters ,",
    "we present evidence that a graph with hexagonal symmetry is at least a local free - energy minimum for the model . the very interesting question of whether the system can generate a three - dimensional lattice in some region of its parameter space is left for future work .",
    "it is useful to relate quantum graphity to existing approaches to quantum gravity .",
    "it is certainly the case that several of the so - called background - independent approaches to quantum gravity are graph - based : loop quantum gravity@xcite , causal sets@xcite , algebraic loop quantum gravity@xcite , and quantum causal histories@xcite , among others .",
    "this is not surprising , since network - based states have a strong relational character , a feature considered desirable in a background - independent context .",
    "quantum graphity also shares with these theories a common central question , the search for the semiclassical , or low - energy , states in the theory .",
    "however , there are also basic differences .",
    "the dynamics of quantum graphity with matter is essentially an extension of the string - net hamiltonian of levin and wen and not a quantization of the einstein equations ( string - nets are tensor product categories , just like spin networks , making the introduction of levin - wen - type dynamics technically straightforward ) .",
    "additionally , the data on the network do not correspond to su(2 ) labels found on spin network states in loop quantum gravity . in quantum graphity",
    ", geometry is identified at the low - energy phase from properties of the network itself .",
    "the outline of the article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s_model ] , we define the model by putting states @xmath4 on the edges of the complete graph @xmath2 .",
    "a @xmath5 state means the edge is `` off , '' or missing , and a @xmath6 state means the edge is on . in sec .",
    "[ s_q_hamiltonian ] , we give the hamiltonian of our model . in sec .",
    "[ s_largegraph ] , we study the model when the number of vertices @xmath0 is large and find that the hexagonal lattice is a good candidate for the ground state for an appropriate choice of parameters .",
    "we consider perturbations over the ground state and find that the hexagonal lattice is thermodynamically stable under local perturbations . in sec .",
    "[ s_moredof ] , we introduce a degeneracy of the on edges : the @xmath6 state is split into @xmath7 .",
    "this allows us to introduce the string - net condensation mechanism of levin and wen @xcite into our dynamics , bringing the model closer to the original quantum graphity system @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ s_graphtheory ] , we initiate a reformulation of our model in graph - theoretic terms , and provide some first observations on the transition from the high- to the low - energy phase . in particular , we compare the transition with processes generating random graphs .    our model introduces a novel mechanism for emergent space and locality and this comes with a new set of questions that need to be investigated in future work .",
    "these include the role of time , temperature , the actual transition between the two phases , and its remnants .",
    "we discuss these in the concluding sec .",
    "[ s_discussion ] .",
    "graph - based , instead of metric - based , theories are attractive implementations of the relational content of diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "the interpretation is that it is the structure of the graph , i.e. the relations between the constituents , that is important to describe physics . as such ,",
    "graphs are probably the most common objects that appear in background - independent theories of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been previously argued in the literature that at the discrete level , spacetime diffeomorphisms should appear as permutation invariance of these fundamental constituents @xcite .",
    "we shall implement this by starting with the complete graph @xmath2 on @xmath0 vertices , an object that is permutation invariant .",
    "the dynamics on the complete graph will be chosen so that it respects the permutation invariance of @xmath2 and depends on natural graph features : vertices , closed paths and open paths .",
    "we first review some useful graph - theoretic properties and techniques .",
    "next , we introduce the necessary quantum mechanical notation and then finally define the hamiltonian models on graphs that we will consider in this paper .      the complete undirected graph on @xmath0 vertices is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "it is a graph in which every two vertices are connected by an edge .",
    "if the vertices are labeled by @xmath8 then @xmath2 has an edge @xmath9 connecting any two @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "any graph @xmath12 on @xmath0 vertices can be regarded as a subgraph of the complete graph @xmath2 ; specifically , it can be obtained by deleting edges from @xmath2 . a convenient way to represent",
    "@xmath12 is via its set of edges @xmath13 or via its @xmath14 adjacency matrixa_ab(g)=\\ {    ll 1&e_abe(g ) + 0 &    . by definition , the adjacency matrix is symmetric and it has zero diagonal .",
    "information about a graph can be obtained from its adjacency matrix with the use of linear algebra . in particular , powers of the adjacency matrix , defined as",
    "follows : [ apowers ]    a^(2)_ab & = _ c a_ac a_cb , + a^(3)_ab & = _",
    "c_d a_ac a_cd a_db , ,    contain information about open and closed paths in the graph . as an example",
    ", the @xmath15 component of the @xmath16 power of @xmath17 denotes the number of ways one can move from vertex @xmath10 to vertex @xmath11 by jumping only along the edges of the graph in a fixed , @xmath18 , number of steps . when @xmath19 and the element considered is on the diagonal , then @xmath20 denotes the number of paths in the graph of length @xmath18 that start and end on the same vertex @xmath10 .    when using the powers of the adjacency matrix to enumerate closed and open paths , it is essential to understand that the numbers computed include paths which traverse certain edges more than once .",
    "for example , in a graph with vertices labeled by @xmath21 and edges labeled by pairs @xmath22 , a sequence such as @xmath23 would be counted as a path of length four from vertex @xmath24 to vertex @xmath25 , irrespective of the fact that the edge @xmath26 is used @xmath25 times in the sequence or that there exist a shorter sequence of edges , namely @xmath27 , that connects the same two vertices .    for future use ,",
    "it is also useful to define the notion of nonretracing paths .",
    "we define a _ nonretracing path _ to be an alternating sequence of vertices and edges , in which any particular edge appears exactly once .",
    "it is useful to specify that nonretracing paths can be _ open _ or _ closed _ and that a nonretracing path is not necessarily a geodesic between two vertices .",
    "a closed nonretracing path is also said to be a _",
    "cycle_. the number of cycles can be computed algorithmically but not with the straight forward use of powers of the adjacency matrix . some questions regarding counting",
    "the number of cycles of a given length can be very difficult ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "we would now like to set up a framework which would allow us to encode the complete graph @xmath2 and its subgraphs as states in a quantum mechanical hilbert space . to do this",
    ", we define a large hilbert space @xmath28 made up of smaller spaces associated with components of the complete graph @xmath2 . in general",
    ", it is possible to associate a hilbert space @xmath29 to each edge @xmath9 and a hilbert space @xmath30 to each vertex .",
    "the total hilbert space of the system would then be the tensor product _",
    "total = [ hhtot ] ^n(n-1)/2 _ edge ^n _ vertex . in the following ,",
    "we specialize to models in which all the degrees of freedom are on the edges of the graph as opposed to both the edges and vertices .    the basic hilbert space associated with an edge is chosen to be that of a fermionic oscillator .",
    "that is , @xmath29 will be [ hhedge ] _ edge = \\",
    "{ |0 , |1 } ; the state @xmath31 is called the empty state and the state @xmath32 is said to contain one particle .",
    "( one can alternatively think of @xmath33 and @xmath34 as being states in the computational basis of a qubit . )",
    "a general state in the total space of edges @xmath35 is [ psiggeneral ] |= _ \\{n } c_\\{n } |n_12|n_13|n_23 , _ i.e. _ , a superposition of all possible states which are themselves tensor products of states @xmath36 associated with single edges ; @xmath37 are occupation numbers and @xmath38 are complex coefficients .    in the graph model , a given edge of the graph is interpreted as being on or off depending on whether the corresponding state has a particle or not .",
    "the collection of on states define a subgraph of the complete graph @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the total hilbert space of edges can be decomposed as ( recall that we ignore degrees of freedom on the vertices ) [ hhtotsum ] _ total = _ g _ g with the tensor sum being over all subgraphs @xmath12 of @xmath2 .",
    "each term in ( [ psiggeneral ] ) corresponds to a state in one of the blocks @xmath39 .",
    "since we treat the vertices as distinguishable , there may be many blocks in the sum that correspond to isomorphic graphs .",
    "acting on the hilbert space of each edge are the usual creation and annihilation operators @xmath40 and @xmath10 .",
    "they act in the usual way , a|0= 0 , a|1= |0 , and obey the anticommutation relation \\{a , a^ } = aa^+ a^a = 1.the other anticommutators are zero , @xmath41 .",
    "there is a hermitian operator @xmath42 , whose action on a state @xmath43 with @xmath44 is [ numberop ] a^a |n= n    reveals the number of particles present in a state .",
    "it is now possible to define operators ( [ numberop ] ) that act on each of the copies of @xmath29 .",
    "these will be denoted by subscripts and defined in the intuitive way , _",
    "n_13 & ( |n_12|n_13 ) + & = ( 1a^a ) ( |n_12|n_13 ) + & = n_13 ( |n_12|n_13 ) .    from the definition of the operators on the middle line",
    ", one can see that number operators acting on different edges commute .",
    "also , since the graphs we are considering are undirected ( that is , the edges are unordered pairs of vertices ) , we identify @xmath45 .",
    "note that the set of operators @xmath46 can be understood as analogous to elements of an adjacency matrix @xmath47 .",
    "that is , the operator @xmath46 gives zero when the state of edge @xmath9 is off and gives @xmath24 when that edge is in an on state . in the previous section",
    "it was shown that it is very useful to define powers of the adjacency matrix as in ( [ apowers ] ) .",
    "it is also reasonable to introduce powers of these number operators .",
    "for example , we define [ npowers ]    n^(2)_ab & = _ c n_ac n_cb , + n^(3)_ab & = _ c_d n_ac",
    "n_cd n_db ,    when the elements of these matrices @xmath48 act on a state , they return a nonzero answer if the state contained a path between two vertices of a certain length @xmath49 passing through edges whose @xmath18 values is different from zero .",
    "thus these operators are quantum mechanical analogs of @xmath50 that count the number of closed and open paths that pass through a vertex ; here these operators count closed and open paths in the on graph only .",
    "there are some differences , however , due to the fact that the creation and annihilation operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 acting on the same edge do not commute .",
    "terms which contain at least two creation operators and two annihilation operators can in principle be ordered in several inequivalent ways . in setups involving the harmonic oscillators",
    ", there is a standard convention for ordering operators called _ normal ordering _ denoted by putting colons around an operator . in this convention ,",
    "all annihilation operators @xmath51 are set to the right of the creation operators @xmath53 for example , the terms in the normal - ordered number operator squared are of the form n_bc n_cd = a^_bc a_bc a^_cd a_cd = a^_bc a^_cd a_bc a_cd .",
    "when @xmath54 , the same two annihilation operators appear on the right . since ( for @xmath44 ) a a |n= 0 , which follows from the anticommutation relations , one finds that [ numbersquared ] n_bc n_cb = 0 .",
    "consequently , whenever a term of @xmath55 with @xmath56 acts on the same edge more than once , that term does not contribute .",
    "therefore , the eigenvalues of operators @xmath57 for each @xmath58 return the number of _ nonoverlapping paths _ between vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 . we will make use of the normal ordering convention and this property , in particular , when defining and analyzing the quantum hamiltonian for the graph model .",
    "we would now like to define a condensed matter like model in which the configuration space is the space of all possible graphs on a fixed number of vertices .",
    "for this purpose we consider hamiltonian function ( operator ) @xmath59 acting on states in the hilbert space @xmath28 defined in ( [ hhtot ] ) .",
    "a hamiltonian operator is usually used to associate an energy @xmath13 with a state @xmath60 .",
    "we do this here using the normal - ordering prescription described above , [ egnormal ] e(g ) = _ g | h| _ g. this notation for the energy should not be confused with the set of edges of a graph ; the meaning of the symbol @xmath13 should be clear from the context .",
    "we would like the hamiltonian to preserve the permutation invariance symmetry of @xmath2 . in a general manner , therefore , we can ask what hamiltonian can be written down for a graph model using the adjacency matrix operators defined in the previous section .",
    "it turns out that there are many terms that can be written down that fit the requirement of permutation symmetry .",
    "the trace @xmath61 or the sum of the off - diagonal elements @xmath62 are simple examples .",
    "tracing or summing over all elements can also be done using powers of @xmath46 , which can be defined as in ( [ npowers ] ) .",
    "other possibilities include first defining an object @xmath63 , taking powers of this object as in @xmath64 for some @xmath65 , and then summing @xmath66 . in the following we choose terms that appear natural from the graph - theoretic perspective .",
    "a basic property of a graph is its distribution of vertex degrees - the number of edges adjoining each vertex . indeed , in graph",
    "theory one often studies the class of @xmath67-regular graphs in which all vertices have a specified and fixed degree ( also called valence ) .",
    "we would like to introduce a term in the hamiltonian that will set a preferred vertex valence and thus effectively restrict the configuration space of the graph model from the space of all possible graphs to the space of @xmath67-regular graphs .",
    "the general form of this valence hamiltonian should depend only on the number of on edges attached to a given vertex , h_v = g_v _ a f_a ( _ b n_ab , v_0 ) . here",
    "@xmath68 is a positive coupling constant and @xmath69 is a free real parameter .",
    "the function @xmath70 should be chosen such that its minimum occurs when vertex @xmath10 has exactly @xmath69 on - links attached to it . the outer sum over vertices",
    "@xmath10 indicates that all vertices in the graph should have the same valence @xmath69 to minimize the total energy .",
    "a specific choice of @xmath71 is h_v = g_v _ a e^ p ( v_0 -_b n_ab ) ^2 where @xmath65 is another real constant .",
    "the exponential is defined by its series expansion in @xmath65 : for example , for the @xmath72 term , [ valpexp ]    e^ p ( v_0-_b n_1b ) ^2 = & 1 + p(v_0 -n_12-n_13- ) ^2 + & + ( v_0 - n_12 - n_13 - ) ^4 + o(p^3 )    the ellipses within the parentheses stand instead of the summation over the other @xmath73 .",
    "qualitatively , the effect of the valence hamiltonian @xmath71 is to set the preferred valence for a graph to @xmath69 and assign an energy penalty for each vertex whose valence is @xmath74 .",
    "it will be important later that this penalty , for each vertex , scales roughly with the exponential of the valence difference squared , [ deltaevscale ] e_v ~e^p ( v - v_0)^2.the details of this scaling are unfortunately somewhat complicated due to the normal - ordering convention .",
    "since the energy of a state is calculated using the normal - ordering convention ( [ egnormal ] ) and this convention implies relations such as ( [ numbersquared ] ) , one has to be careful when considering contributions from terms in which number operators are raised to various powers : contributions such as @xmath75 in the expansion ( [ valpexp ] ) give zero regardless of whether the edge @xmath76 is on or off , and other terms also disappear in this way . despite these issues , it is possible to check explicitly that once the energy is computed up to sufficient order in @xmath65 , the minimum of ( [ valpexp ] ) is indeed at @xmath69 and that the exponential scaling relation ( [ deltaevscale ] ) holds .",
    "the remaining parts of this paper only rely on the qualitative behavior of the valence term .",
    "the next terms that we consider involve powers of the matrix @xmath46 and depend on the number of closed paths present in a graph .    at this stage",
    "we do not wish to introduce a bias for any particular power , say @xmath77 or @xmath78 or @xmath79 , corresponding to a cycle length .",
    "therefore , we would like to write a term for every @xmath49 in the range @xmath80 .",
    "however , since we do want to keep the dynamics of the model quasilocal , we would like to be able to arrange , by adjusting some parameters or couplings , for very high powers of @xmath46 to be relatively unimportant .    there is more than one way to achieve this but we chose a particular form which can be written down compactly as [ hb ] h_b = _ a h_b_a where @xmath81 is rooted at a vertex @xmath10 and is given by [ hba ] h_b_a = -g_b _ b _ ab e^r n_ab . here @xmath82 is a positive coupling and @xmath83 is a real parameter . the exponential is defined in terms of a series expansion , e^r n_ab = _ l=0^",
    "n_ab^(l ) . recall from ( [ npowers ] ) that the operators of @xmath48 return the number of paths of length @xmath49 in the ` on ' graph that connect vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "when these powers of the number operator are normal - ordered , paths that overlap become unimportant and only nonoverlapping paths contribute .",
    "the sum over @xmath11 and the delta function @xmath84 in ( [ hba ] ) together ensure that only closed paths are counted .    by ( [ egnormal ] )",
    "then , this hamiltonian assigns to the graph an energy [ egpaths ] e_b(g ) = - _",
    "a_l=0^ g_b(l ) p(a , l ) that depends on the number of closed paths @xmath85 at each vertex @xmath10 of length @xmath49 . the `` effective '' coupling for each cycle length is given by [ gbeff ] g_b(l ) = g_b . in practice ,",
    "terms with @xmath86 are uninteresting constants , terms with @xmath87 vanish because there are no closed paths of that length , and all terms with @xmath88 vanish because those closed paths are necessarily overlapping .",
    "hence the hamiltonian @xmath89 starts contributing at @xmath77 .",
    "a number of comments about this hamiltonian are in order .",
    "first , ( [ hba ] ) and ( [ egpaths ] ) both have an overall negative sign .",
    "this indicates that a graph has lower energy the more cycles it has . since the system is finite , the hamiltonian is bounded from below and this negative sign does not create any problems . also , the energy associated per node is finite and constant for a regular graph even when the number of vertices goes to infinity ; this is related to the second comment below .",
    "second , it is important to understand which of the various terms contributing to @xmath90 are most important . in graphs with a large number of vertices ,",
    "the number of long cycles at a vertex @xmath10 is often larger than the number of short cycles , @xmath91 . for certain classes of graphs ,",
    "it is possible to estimate the growth of @xmath85 with @xmath49 : for example , all @xmath92-regular graphs have @xmath85 bounded from above by a polynomial of order @xmath93 .",
    "however , the effective coupling @xmath94 multiplying @xmath85 in ( [ egpaths ] ) falls faster than any power for large @xmath49 .",
    "hence it is guaranteed that extremely long cycles do not contribute significantly to the energy of a graph . in this sense @xmath81",
    "is a quasilocal operator that contributes only a finite amount to the energy of a vertex .    for intermediate values of @xmath49 ,",
    "the situation is more subtle .",
    "the effective coupling is maximized at a length @xmath95 for which g_b(l^ * ) > g_b(l ) , ll^*. this scale depends solely on the parameter @xmath83 .",
    "another characteristic length is @xmath96 defined for each vertex by g_b(l_a^ * * ) p(a , l_a^ * * ) > g_b(l ) p(a , l ) , l l_a^**. this second length is graph dependent .",
    "the lengths that are relevant for determining the total energy assigned to a vertex or a graph range from zero to some multiple of @xmath97 .",
    "third and last , note that the parameter @xmath83 is raised to various powers in ( [ gbeff ] ) .",
    "if this parameter is positive , so is the effective coupling @xmath94 .",
    "if this parameter is negative , however , the effective coupling @xmath94 has a different sign for cycles of even and odd lengths . in the latter case ,",
    "even cycles can lower the energy of a graph while odd cycles incur it a positive energy penalty .      the previous terms @xmath71 and @xmath98 can be thought of as being terms in a `` free '' graph model - they are eigenoperators of graph states and do not change the linking structure between vertices .",
    "a general graph model hamiltonian might also have some `` interaction terms '' which change the graph diagram of a graph state . as a matter of principle , in fact ,",
    "interaction terms are necessary in a graph model because they define how a graph state can evolve from one configuration to another .",
    "one might think of many possible interactions for graphs .",
    "however , we would like to impose a restriction of locality on the interactions so that they affect only small local neighborhoods of vertices .",
    "some examples of such possible interactions are shown in fig .",

    "can be formulated as h_(exch ) = g_(exch ) _",
    "abcd^ n_ab ( a^_ad a^_bc a_bd a_ac ) .",
    "the prime on the summation indicates that the vertices @xmath99 are assumed to be all different .",
    "the presence of the number operator @xmath46 in the interaction term ensures that the exchange operation between vertices @xmath99 takes place if and only if the link between vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 is on .",

    "it is possible to generalize these terms such that they exchange or add links between vertices that are more separated from each other .    the couplings @xmath103 and",
    "@xmath104 determine how likely the interactions are to happen .",

    "we begin by noting that regular lattices can be thought of as special regular graphs in which some of the cycles correspond to plaquettes .",

    "note that a @xmath67-process does not consider at all the number of cycles for each vertex , our important second requirement .",
    "what can we say about this point ?",
    "let us focus on the case @xmath211 .",
    "it is known that the probability @xmath212 that a graph chosen at random from the set of all cubic graphs on @xmath0 vertices contains exactly @xmath213 cycles of length @xmath49 ( where @xmath213 is fixed ) goes to pr(t ) ~as @xmath214 .",
    "also , the expected number of cycles of length @xmath49 in a random cubic graph on @xmath0 vertices goes to @xmath215 as @xmath214 . in our model",
    "we must take into account the term @xmath98 in the hamiltonian that depends on the cycles .",
    "because of this term , the graph associated to the ground state of the hamiltonian needs to have a relatively large number of short cycles .",
    "the above observation about the cycle structure in @xmath67-processes does not reflect this behavior .",
    "it follows that @xmath67-processes do not seem to be good candidates to implement the dynamics suggested by our model .",
    "another reason supporting this statement comes from the diameter . for a @xmath67-regular graph @xmath12 on @xmath0 vertices , diam(g)1+_d-1((2+)dnn ) , with probability tending to @xmath24 as @xmath214 .",
    "since @xmath0 is very large in our context , we can consider the above formula as a good approximation .",
    "note that the behavior of diam@xmath216 exhibits an interesting cutoff phenomenon : @xmath217 increases very slowly when @xmath218 but rises quickly for @xmath219 . conjecturing that the graph associated to the ground state of our model has a small hausdorff dimension @xmath220",
    ", the diameter should be proportional to @xmath221 , and this is much larger than the diameter of a @xmath67-regular random graph .",
    "in addition to the above reasoning , we can still observe that random regular graphs can play a role in our mode . by taking @xmath222 , from a simple statistical mechanics argument",
    "suggests that the probability of a vertex having degree @xmath92 is pr ( vv_0 ) ( -e^(v - v_0)^2).when @xmath0 is very large , this can be considered as a good approximation , despite the fact that the probability can not be taken independently for each vertex , given that increasing the degree to one vertex implies increasing the degree of another one .",
    "also , when @xmath223 , the cycles structure does not play a role in determining the ground state .",
    "so , in this extremal case with @xmath222 , we can expect that the graphity model gives rise to a @xmath67-regular random graph .",
    "finally , it is worth commenting on scale - free graphs which have been widely discussed in the literature , also in the context of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "a _ scale - free graph _ is a graph in which the degrees @xmath224 of vertices @xmath92 exhibit the yule - simon distribution pr [ d(v)=k]~k^-.the exponent @xmath225 is often in the range @xmath226 $ ] .",
    "this means that a scale - free graph has a few vertices with very high degree and many vertices with very small degree . because of the valence term @xmath71 in our hamiltonian which gives a high - energy penalty @xmath227 to vertices with different degree from @xmath69 , it is implausible to have vertices with very large degree at low temperature in our model .",
    "it thus appears that many known ways to generate graphs can not reproduce the features implemented through the hamiltonian of our model .",
    "a graph process that would successfully reproduce the dynamics of the hamiltonian would necessarily have to involve a cost function that would preferentially create @xmath228regular graphs with a large number of cycles of prescribed lengths .",
    "defining such a cost function in a plausible way is difficult .",
    "the cost function in principle should take into account a value associated to each edge .",
    "a candidate process could be one that carries on by greedily deleting edges in agreement with the function .",
    "each edge has a cost and at each time - step the edge with the smallest cost is deleted .",
    "the cost of each edge depends on the number of cycles of prescribed lengths that will be in the graph after the deletion of the edge .",
    "the cost function needs to be updated at each time - step , since the deletion of a single edge implies a possibly large variation on the number of cycles in which other edges are contained .",
    "this observation suggests that implementing the behavior induced by the hamiltonian , with the use of a cost function of pure combinatorial nature , is highly expensive from the computational point of view , and it is possibly ill - defined .",
    "for this reason , a mathematical description of a graph process mimicking our dynamics is elusive .",
    "quantum graphity is an explicit model for geometrogenesis , with locality , translation symmetry , _ etc .",
    "_ , being properties of the ground state . in table",
    "[ t_summary ] , we have summarized the properties of quantum graphity at high and low temperatures .    at high temperature ,",
    "the graph representing the state of the system is highly connected and has diameter close to 1 .",
    "there is no notion of locality , as most of the universe is one - edge adjacent to any vertex .",
    "said differently , there is no notion of a subsystem , in the sense of a local neighborhood , since the neighborhood of any vertex is the entire @xmath2 .",
    "the microscopic degrees of freedom are the @xmath229 and @xmath142 labels .    at low temperature ,",
    "the graph has far fewer edges than @xmath2 .",
    "permutation invariance of the state breaks to translation invariance .",
    "subsystems can be defined as subgraphs of the ground state or , better , as the emergent matter excitations , and the dynamics of the emergent matter is local by correspondence with lattice field theory @xcite .",
    "once subsystems are present , _ internal geometry _ can be defined .",
    "this is the relational geometry that is the only physically meaningful notion of geometry , and hence time , for observers inside a system .",
    "the significance of internal time and its relation to general relativity has been discussed extensively , for example , in @xcite .       on a more technical level ,",
    "the model is written in terms of fermionic operators acting on a large hilbert space based on a complete graph . a term in the model hamiltonian ( @xmath98 ) that detects the cycle structure of a graph",
    "is crucially defined using powers of a quantum adjacency matrix and the normal - ordering convention .    while our definition of @xmath98 has the properties that we would like to implement in a graphity model , we find it interesting to point out , as a side remark , that other choices could also be made .",
    "for example , there is some interest in the graph theory literature in a relation counting loops ( in our notation ) of the form e_(g ) = _ l=1^ ( l ) , where , in contrast to ( [ egpaths ] ) of our model , the denominator on the right - hand side is @xmath49 rather @xmath233 and the object @xmath234 denotes the number of prime geodesics in a graph @xmath12 rather than the number of nonoverlapping closed paths .",
    "this quantity @xmath235 is related to the ihara zeta function of a graph ; we refer to the literature for more details @xcite and finish this side remark by saying that we have not looked at the behavior of @xmath235 in a graphity model .    besides the definition of the hamiltonian term @xmath98 that depends on quantum mechanical features , our study of the model is limited to stationary states and is thus mostly classical .",
    "we find evidence to support our conjecture that , for the given set of parameters , the hexagonal lattice , possibly wrapped into a tube or a torus , is a good candidate for the ground state of the model : it has lower energy than other regular graphs with a large number of cycles of length 6 , and it corresponds to at least a local free - energy minimum as found by heuristic arguments looking at small and large local perturbations .",
    "the last argument relies on the notion of emergent locality and the restriction of the possible interactions in the graph to moves that act on small subgraphs .",
    "these arguments could be extended to other ground state lattices in different regions of the parameter space .",
    "there are a number of important open questions",
    ". it would be useful to verify , perhaps numerically , that a locally hexagonal lattice or a similar configuration is the state with minimal energy as conjectured in sec .",
    "[ s_largegraph ] . at the same time , an extension of the model to produce extended three - dimensional spatial lattices would also be worthwhile .",
    "this could perhaps be done , as suggested in the original graphity model @xcite , by setting the preferred valence to @xmath236 .    as the quantum graphity model is based on a hamiltonian ,",
    "it is more akin to condensed - matter physics than to other algorithmic approaches to building a space or spacetime from spins on graphs @xcite .",
    "however , the hamiltonian approach raises an intriguing question regarding the role of temperature .",
    "we model the geometrogenesis transition as a cooling process that suggests the presence of a reservoir at a tunable temperature .",
    "this could be a problem if the graph is to be interpreted as the entire universe .",
    "the question is then whether this external temperature is indeed a physical temperature or some other renormalization parameter .",
    "we believe the model needs to be understood further before this and similar questions can be properly addressed .    another important next step is to study the transition from the high - energy to the low - energy phases and look for possible observable remnants .",
    "the transition is a complicated process and at this stage we only understand it in the limit where @xmath68 is the only nonzero coupling .",
    "one possibility for progress in this direction is to generalize the random graph process to the case where the graph cycles have structure .",
    "a necessary part of this project involves extending string - network condensation to irregular graphs , a question that is of interest independently of this work .",
    "finally , an intriguing goal for the model is to understand the transition from the description of the system in terms of microscopic @xmath237 variables to a more standard representation in terms of matter and geometry .",
    "the way that we normally understand matter and gravity is as two sets of degrees of freedom coupled by a nonlinear relation given by the einstein equations .",
    "normally , we can study each part separately : in the no - gravity limit we have quantum field theory on a fixed background and with no matter we have pure gravity . in our model , the dynamics of the @xmath237 variables serves both to organize the graph into a local regular structure with symmetries and to give rise to the effective u(1 ) matter .",
    "there is no fundamental split into gravity and matter .",
    "since the effective matter and the geometry are different low - energy aspects of the same microscopic degrees of freedom , matter and the geometry can only be decoupled in a certain limit .",
    "it has been conjectured elsewhere that such a relation can give rise to the einstein equations @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to investigate this possibility in the context of our model .",
    "we are grateful to our colleagues at pi and the spinoza institute for comments and discussions during the course of this work .",
