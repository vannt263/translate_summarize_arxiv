    "the construction of new solvable systems is an interesting problem by itself in mathematical physics . in the quantum framework ,",
    "the techniques of supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) @xcite have proved to be one of the simplest and efficient tools to achieve this goal . from the analytical point of view , these basically correspond to a single or multi - step darboux transformations @xcite . applying such transformations to a class of known solvable systems that are guided by primary translationally shape invariant potentials ( tsip ) @xcite , we can generate chains of new potentials , called extensions , which are ( quasi)isospectral to the original potential and whose eigenfunctions are entirely determined in an explicit way .    of particular interest",
    "are the rational extended potentials , i.e. , extensions which are rational in an appropriate variable .",
    "it appears that those obtained from the three confining tsip ( namely , the harmonic oscillator , isotonic oscillator and trigonometric darboux - pschl - teller potentials ) have eigenfunctions which coincide ( up to a gauge factor ) with the exceptional orthogonal polynomials recently discovered by gmez - ullate , kamran , and milson @xcite . during the last five years",
    ", this topic has been the subject of an intense research activity ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in general , for a given primary tsip ,",
    "the possible rational extensions are characterized by one or two multi - indices , which define in a unique way the corresponding extended potentials @xcite .",
    "then , until now , the rationality condition appears quite restrictive , by excluding the possibility to generate families of potentials depending on one or several continuous parameters , which is a very interesting feature of susy qm @xcite .",
    "the one ( @xmath0-)parameter isospectral families are in particular closely connected to one ( multi-)soliton solutions of some nonlinear evolution equations .    in this paper , we show that for the trigonometric darboux - pschl - teller ( tdpt ) potential with some specific underlying parameters , it is nevertheless possible to generate one - parameter families of rational extensions via one - step state - adding darboux transformations . to achieve this goal we use seed functions based on para - jacobi polynomials @xcite .",
    "although noticed by szeg in his classical treatise @xcite , the possibility for the jacobi equation to admit in some cases a general solution that is a polynomial has not been considered in the other standard treatises on orthogonal polynomials .",
    "it has been highlighted only recently by calogero and yi @xcite , who introduced the so - called para - jacobi polynomials .",
    "this result has been now extended by calogero , who has considered in particular a more general second - order linear differential equation , featuring an arbitrary number of free parameters , for which all the solutions are polynomials @xcite , and has also defined the concept of generalized hypergeometric polynomials @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by recalling the essential features of darboux transformations and of the trigonometric darboux - pschl - teller potential ( tdpt ) in secs .",
    "ii and iii , respectively . in sec .",
    "iv , we introduce the para - jacobi polynomials and specify the domain of values of the free parameter for which they are nodeless on the considered interval . in sec .",
    "v , we then use the corresponding eigenfunctions as seed functions for state - adding darboux - bcklund transformations to build a set of extensions of the tdpt potentials , which are regular , rational , and dependent on one continuous parameter .",
    "in addition , we determine explicitly the eigenstates of these extended potentials and give plots for several values of the parameter in the first non - trivial case of the extension .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vi contains the conclusion .",
    "a formal eigenfunction @xmath3 for the eigenvalue @xmath4 of the one - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath5 , is a solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath6 in the following , we simply call eigenfunctions such formal eigenfunctions , employing eigenstates for the eigenfunctions satisfying given dirichlet boundary conditions at the limits of the definition interval @xmath7 . with such dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath7 , @xmath8 is supposed to admit a discrete spectrum of energies and eigenstates @xmath9 where , without loss of generality , we can always take the ground level of @xmath8 at zero ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we suppose also that in the considered domain of eigenvalues , the eigenfunctions can be indexed by a real spectral parameter @xmath11 ( @xmath12 @xmath13 ) which takes integer values @xmath14 when @xmath15 is a bound - state energy .",
    "starting from an eigenfunction @xmath16 of @xmath8 , we define the first - order operator @xmath17 by @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "then , if @xmath20 denotes the wronskian of the functions @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 for @xmath23 , the function defined via the so - called darboux - crum formula @xmath24 is a solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath25 with the same energy @xmath26 as in eq .",

    "nevertheless , we can readily verify that @xmath35 is an eigenfunction of @xmath28 for the eigenvalue @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , by extension , we define the `` image '' by @xmath32 of the seed eigenfunction @xmath33 itself as @xmath37    in general , the transformed potential @xmath28 is singular at the nodes of @xmath16 and for integer values @xmath0 of @xmath38 , @xmath39 is regular only when @xmath40 , that is , when the seed function is the ground state of @xmath8 , which corresponds exactly to the usual susy partnership in quantum mechanics @xcite .",

    "if they are identical , then @xmath33 is nodeless and if they are opposite , then @xmath33 presents a unique zero on @xmath7 . in the first case , @xmath41 constitutes then a regular ( quasi)isospectral extension of @xmath29 .",
