    "galaxy formation is a complex process , involving starbursts , mergers , and strong gas flows ( e.g. , hopkins et  al . 2006 ; brooks et  al .",

    "furthermore , stellar migration and secular processes can change the structure of galaxies at late times ( e.g. , rokar et  al .",
    "2008 ; grand , kawata , & cropper 2012 ) .",
    "therefore , even if we could perfectly locate and age date every star in the milky way , we still could nt say where and with what structural and kinematic properties those stars formed . the only way to establish where a galaxy s stars formed , and hence how it was assembled , is to map the star formation _ while _ those stars were forming .    obtaining and stellar continuum maps of @xmath4 galaxies , with the @xmath5kpc resolution necessary to put constraints on the spatial distribution of star formation , is challenging and has so far only been possible using a combination of adaptive optics and integral field units ( ifus ) on 810 m class telescopes .",
    "these studies paint a complex picture : they find that star forming galaxies at @xmath6 are a mix of `` puffy '' and often clumpy rotating disks , mergers , and more compact dispersion - dominated objects ( e.g. , genzel et  al . 2008 ; shapiro et  al . 2008 ; cresci et  al .",

    "some studies claim that there are trends in the structural properties of as a function of redshift implying that the way galaxies assemble their stars varies fundamentally as a function of cosmic time .",
    "in particular , epinat et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) and kassin et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggest that galaxies become cooler and more rotation - dominated with time , @xmath7 being the epoch of `` disk settling '' .",
    "this is interesting because most of the stars in the disks of galaxies like the milky way were formed in this epoch .",
    "it is now possible to obtain high spatial resolution ( @xmath8kpc ) information on emission at @xmath9 with a high strehl ratio , owing to the near - ir slitless spectroscopic capabilities provided by the wfc3 camera on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . in nelson",
    "( 2012 ) we used data taken as part of the 3d - hst survey to build on previous ground - based studies by mapping the and stellar continuum with high resolution for a sample of 57 galaxies at @xmath9 and showed that star formation broadly follows the rest - frame optical light , but is slightly more extended . here",
    "we stack the  maps of these galaxies to construct high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) radial profiles and measure structural parameters of stellar continuum emission and star formation .",
    "these unique , high spatial resolution data from 3d - hst are combined with kinematics from the near infrared spectrometer ( nirspec ) on the w. m. keck telescope ( mclean et  al .",
    "1998 ) we assume h@xmath10 km s@xmath11mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the selected galaxies appear to lie largely on the upper half of the ` main sequence ' in sfr(ir+uv ) .",
    "[ sel],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the 3d - hst survey , a 248-orbit treasury program on the hubble space telescope , supplies the 2d emission line maps needed to measure the spatial distribution of star formation .",
    "the wfc3 g141 grism provides spatially resolved spectra of all sources in the field .",
    "the wavelength range of the g141 grism , @xmath14 m , covers the h@xmath15 emission line for galaxies in the redshift range @xmath16 .",
    "the survey also provides broad - band near - infrared imaging in the f140w filter , which samples the rest - frame @xmath17 band for @xmath9 . using the same camera under the same conditions to map the both and continuum emission allows us to compare their distributions directly , a crucial advantage of this strategy .",
    "the maps have a spatial sampling of @xmath30.5kpc at @xmath9 ( @xmath18 pixels ) .",
    "the data presented in this paper are based on the @xmath19 pointings , roughly half of the full data set , that were obtained prior to june 2011 see nelson et  al .",
    "the survey , data reduction , and determination of derived quantities ( e.g. redshifts and masses ) are described in brammer et  al .",

    "( 2011 ) .",
    "the 3d - hst grism spectra have high spatial resolution and low spectral resolution ( @xmath20 ) meaning that emission line structure reflects almost exclusively spatial structure ( morphology ) in contrast to data with high spectral resolution where structure reflects velocity ( rotation or dispersion ) .",
    "emission line maps of galaxies are made by subtracting the continuum emission from the two - dimensional spectrum .",
    "the details of the procedure are described in ( nelson et  al .",
    "2012 ; lundgren et  al . 2012 ; schmidt et al .",
    "2012 submitted )    we selected galaxies with redshifts @xmath21 , total f140w ab magnitude @xmath22 , and rest - frame @xmath23 .",
    "we also limited the sample to galaxies with effectively no contaminating flux from the spectra of other nearby objects .",
    "the position of the sample in the @xmath21 star formation rate ( sfr)stellar mass plane is shown in fig.1 .",
    "star formation rates were derived from the ir + uv luminosities as described in whitaker et  al .",
    "the selected galaxies lie predominantly on the upper half of the ` star - forming main sequence ' ( as shown in the histogram of fig 1 ) ( e.g. noeske et  al . 2007 ; daddi et  al .",
    "2007 ; whitaker et  al .",
    "these galaxies were selected in not ir ; while this selection may bias the sample , it may possibly also have the advantage that it adds less uncertainty to interpreting the spatial distribution of star formation due to dust extinction .",
    "we stack the high spatial resolution maps from 3d - hst to create average maps  increasing the s / n and providing for a reliable measurement of the structural properties of to large radii for this sample at @xmath9 .",
    "we divide the sample in three bins based on their h@xmath15 size in order to homogenize the sample and investigate trends with size .",
    "the median stellar masses of the stacks are @xmath24 .",
    "the galaxies are normalized by their f140w flux and centered according to their luminosity - weighted f140w image centers .",
    "we masked the [ sii ] @xmath25 emission in the fit . at our spectral resolution ,",
    "the fwhm of a line is @xmath26 , meaning that  @xmath27 and [ nii ] @xmath28 are unresolved but and [ sii ] are separated by @xmath29 resolution elements .",
    "we rotated the images based on their galfit - derived f140w position angles to align them along their major axes , summed them , and divided the resulting stack by the summed masks .",
    "finally , in order to correct for the effects of the psf , the stacks were deconvolved by adding the galfit - derived psf - deconvolved model to the residuals of the fit , a method developed in szomoru et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "figs.2 and 3 show the stacked , psf - corrected emission .",
    "the s / n in the stacks is high , and the emission is clearly spatially extended .",
    "furthermore , both the rest - frame r - band and maps are clearly elongated .",
    "we quantified the structural properties of the stacks with galfit ( peng et  al .",
    "2002 ) using empirical psfs .",
    "for the continuum and h@xmath15 we find weighted mean axis ratios of @xmath30 and @xmath31()=0.58@xmath32 respectively , consistent with expectations for randomly oriented disks with thickness c / a=0.26,0.33 .",
    "this thickness could be attributed to disks being intrinsically thick at @xmath9 , heterogeneous properties of the galaxies being stacked , the effect of bulges , a selection biased toward face - on galaxies , or noise .",
    "fig.3 shows the radial profiles derived from the stacks .",
    "radial profiles of the psf - corrected stacks were created by summing the flux in elliptical radii .",
    "a 30% correction was applied to account for [ nii ] ( see  4 ) .",
    "all uncertainties were derived by bootstrap resampling the stacks .",
    "the emission ranges from exponential to much less centrally concentrated than exponential .",
    "the stellar continuum emission in all the stacks is nearly exponential .",
    "the radial equivalent width profiles ( right panels of fig.3 ) are flat to within a factor of two and ew()@xmath23 for all stacks within 1.5@xmath33 .",
    "this suggests that the high global ew()s seen in these galaxies are not driven primarily by central starbursts but by strong star formation at all radii .",
    "the derived srsic indices ( fig.2 ) of the and stellar continuum profiles are @xmath34 and @xmath35 with weighted means of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "as shown in van dokkum et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) , structural parameters measured from stacks are close to the mean values for the individual galaxies going into the stacks . the upper limit of @xmath38 for the largest stack reflects the fact that the derived @xmath39 depends somewhat on the details of the fit ( treatment of sky , fitting region ) but always @xmath38 .",
    "we find that the stacked spatial distribution of for galaxies in this sample is exponential or shallower .",
    "all stacks have @xmath40 , implying a bulge fraction of less than 20% ( van dokkum et  al .",
    "the radial profiles ( fig.3 , left ) , seem to show a trend toward lower @xmath41 ( ) with increasing size .",
    "however , this trend is not statistically significant given the errors in the derived srsic indices .",
    "additionally , note that the median galaxy with ew()@xmath23   has a high enough star formation surface density to drive winds out to @xmath42 ( heckman  2002 ) .",
    "a major uncertainty in the interpretation of the radial profile is the effect of differential dust extinction : if some parts of the galaxies are more obscured than others ( see e.g. wuyts et  al .",
    "2012 ) , the derived radial profile of would not reflect the radial profile of star formation . to assess the importance of this effect",
    ", we estimate the extinction as a function of radius .",
    "we determine the extinction from the radial color profile .",
    "the color profile is determined from the combination of the f140w stacks with acs f814w stacks , which can be converted into rest - frame @xmath43 color profiles .",
    "as shown in the left panel of fig.4 , for most of the radial extent of the stacks the color is fairly constant , but it becomes redder inside a radius of 2kpc ( see also szomoru et  al .",
    "2012 ) . to estimate",
    "roughly how color translates into missed star formation , we assume that the star formation that is not captured by will be captured by the ir ( kennicutt et  al . 2009 ) . using photometry from skelton et al .",
    "( 2013 ) in prep , in addition to rest - frame u - v colors and ir - based sfrs from the newfirm medium band survey ( nmbs , whitaker et  al .",
    "2012 ) , empirical relations were derived for the translation of rest - frame u - v colors into star formation corrections : @xmath44    the dust - corrected radial profiles are shown in the right panel of fig 4 .",
    "the smallest galaxies appear to have star formation which is marginally steeper than exponential .",
    "the large galaxies have the largest radial gradients but their implied star formation is still less steep than exponential .",
    "although this analysis assigns the entire observed color gradient to extinction , the centers of the radial color profiles could be red because of dust or age .",
    "importantly , the srsic indices of the star formation in these stacks based on the implied dust correction remain close to one  @xmath45 for each of the stacks , weighted mean=1.0@xmath46 so , even when accounting for dust , the averaged star formation in these galaxies has a nearly exponential spatial distribution .",
    "the flattening of the stacks and the exponential h@xmath15 profiles suggest that the star formation occurs in rotating disks . to test this , we measured kinematics for a subset of this sample using nirspec on the keck ii telescope on april 9 - 10 , 2012 .",
    "the sample comprises eight galaxies chosen from the small  ( 1 ) , middle  ( 5 ) , and large  ( 2 ) stack , which have sizes , masses , srsic indices , star formation rates , and axis ratios representative of the sample as a whole .",
    "we used the low dispersion mode of nirspec with 0.5 `` seeing and a slit width of 0.7 '' , giving a spectral resolution of @xmath47km / s in the @xmath48 band ( compared to @xmath49km / s in the grism spectra ) .",
    "the slit was aligned along the major axis of each galaxy and observations were conducted in a series of four 900s exposures , dithering along the slit .",
    "the data reduction followed standard procedures for long slit spectroscopy ( see , e.g. , van dokkum et  al .",
    "we extracted kinematic information from the two dimensional spectra by fitting a gaussian to the and [ nii ] emission simultaneously at each spatial position along the slit .",
    "the median [ nii]/ is 0.3 . assuming the velocity shear in the two dimensional spectra is due to rotation , we take the rotational velocity to be the velocity difference between the geometrical center of the galaxy and the maximum velocity .",
    "we correct the rotation velocities for inclination angle using the 3d - hst axis ratios .",
    "we calculate one dimensional velocity dispersions by fitting a gaussian to the  emission in the central row of each spectrum .",
    "we calculate the instrumental @xmath50 to be @xmath51km / s by fitting a gaussian to the sky lines .",
    "the intrinsic velocity dispersion is calculated by subtracting the instrumental dispersion from the measured dispersion in quadrature .",
    "we find that all galaxies show velocity shear in their two dimensional spectra , with derived rotation velocities of 90235 km / s uncorrected and 110330 km / s corrected for inclination .",
    "fig.5 shows the rotation curves for one example galaxy for each stack .",
    "these spectra are of the best quality but appear to be representative of the eight .",
    "the velocity profile of the smallest galaxy in fig.3 does not show evidence for a turnover , which means the measured maximum velocity is a lower limit on the rotation velocity at large radii .",
    "we conclude that the kinematics are consistent with the disk interpretation of the structural properties of the emission .",
    "although different classification methods make it difficult to perform a quantitative comparison , our results are qualitatively consistent with the finding that a large fraction of star - forming galaxies at @xmath9 appear to be rotating .",
    "( e.g. , wisnioski et  al . 2011 ; epinat et  al . 2012 ; swinbank et  al . 2012 ) .",
    "the central result of this paper is that the radial distribution of stacked emission in @xmath0 galaxies is close to exponential out to @xmath52 kpc . combined with the axis ratios of the stacks and the kinematics of a subset of the sample , the most straightforward interpretation is that star formation seems typically to occur in disks at @xmath9 at least for galaxies with high ew ( ) . the factor of @xmath53 increase in the star formation rates of galaxies from @xmath54 to @xmath55 ( e.g. , damen et  al .",
    "2009 ; fumagalli et  al .",
    "2012 ) is apparently driven by increased star formation activity in disks rather than a much greater prevalence of merger - driven central starbursts  consistent with other studies ( e.g. , rodighiero et  al .",
    "2011 ; wuyts et  al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "this result raises a number of questions .",
    "first , it is not clear how these galaxies are related to @xmath56 galaxies .",
    "an average galaxy in this sample has a distribution of stars with a srsic index of @xmath57 .",
    "if this average galaxy forms stars with @xmath58 , it will have a lower srsic index at later times .",
    "either we are witnessing the build up of only the latest of late - type galaxies ; these galaxies substantially change where their star formation is occurring between @xmath9 and @xmath56 ; or their stars , once formed , must migrate into a different configuration .",
    "in other words , if these are the ancestors of typical @xmath56 spiral galaxies , their bulges need to be built in some way besides the star formation we are seeing . this could be accomplished by mergers or secular evolution ( e.g. , bournaud , elmegreen , & martig 2009 ; ellison et  al .",
    "these observations could be understood in the context of the following picture : at @xmath59 , disks are gas - rich and turbulent .",
    "as redshift decreases , the gas fraction decreases , and a bar instability grows , increasing the central concentration and central vertical velocity dispersion .",
    "( e.g. , van  den  bosch 2001 ; debuhr , ma , & white 2012 ; forbes , krumholz , & burkert 2012 )    we also note the somewhat surprising presence of a population of large , rapidly - rotating disks with relatively low stellar masses at @xmath9 .",
    "these galaxies have mean @xmath33()=7.3kpc , v=240km / s , @xmath60km / s , and @xmath61 , meaning they are disks 8gyr ago , larger in size than the milky way ( drimmel & spergel 2001 ) and thicker ( freeman 1987 ) , with @xmath62 of the stellar mass ( mcmillan 2011 ) and similar or higher maximum rotation velocities ( bovy , hogg , & rix 2009 ) .",
    "both what these galaxies become in the local universe and how such extended star forming disks were made in an epoch of high disk turbulence are open questions .",
    "the small disks on the other end of the size distribution are also of interest . with",
    "median @xmath33()=1.9kpc , @xmath33(r)=2.1kpc , @xmath63m@xmath64 , and stacked @xmath65 , they more closely resemble compact versions of disky star formers than merger - driven star formation in spheroids ( see also van  der  wel et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) . )",
    "there are several caveats .",
    "first , our sample is not complete in mass or in sfr(uv+ir ) . in future papers ( using the full 3d - hst survey ) we will study the distribution of star formation as a function of these parameters .",
    "second , the distribution of star formation in the stacks is not necessarily representative of individual galaxies . in individual galaxies",
    "the star formation is clumpy ( e.g. genzel et  al .",
    "2008 , 2011 ; frster schreiber et  al . 2009 ; nelson et  al .",
    "2012 , fig.1 ) and it is difficult to quantify the structure . stacking these clumpy objects could be hazardous , but it may also provide more insight than can be gleaned from individual galaxies : assuming that the clumps are transient and `` light up '' a part of the underlying gas disk for a short time ( as in e.g. wuyts et  al .",
    "2012 ) , our stacking technique effectively produces a time - averaged map of the star formation in the galaxies .",
    "finally , dust attenuation remains a key uncertainty , both in the selection and in the interpretation of the profiles .",
    "this can be addressed with maps of the ir emission at the full alma resolution , or by measuring ( spatially - resolved ) balmer decrements .",
