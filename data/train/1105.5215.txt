    "identification of deterministic linear operators from an input - output measurement is an important problem in many fields of engineering .",

    "it is natural to ask under which conditions on the operator , identification from an input - output measurement is possible in principle , and how one would go about choosing the probing signal and extracting the operator from the corresponding output signal .",
    "this paper addresses these questions in generality by considering the ( large ) class of linear operators that can be represented as a continuous weighted superposition of time - frequency shift operators , i.e. , the operator s response to the signal @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the spreading function of the operator @xmath5 . the representation theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "14.3.5 ) states that the action of any continuous ( and hence bounded ) linear operator , under additional mild restrictions , can be represented as in . in the communications literature @xcite ,",
    "operators with input - output relation as in are referred to as linear time - varying channels / systems and @xmath4 is the delay - doppler spreading function . for the special case of linear time - invariant ( lti ) systems , we have @xmath6 , so that reduces to @xmath7 the question of identifiability of lti systems is readily answered by noting that the system s response to @xmath8 is given by its impulse response @xmath9 , which fully characterizes the input - output relation according to .",
    "lti systems are therefore always identifiable , provided that the input signal can have infinite bandwidth and we can observe the output signal over an infinite duration . in the general case ( i.e. , for ltv systems ) , the situation is fundamentally different .",
    "specifically , kailath s landmark paper @xcite shows that ltv systems with spreading function compactly supported on a rectangle are identifiable if and only if the spreading function s support area satisfies @xmath1 .",
    "bello @xcite later pointed out that kailath s identifiability result continues to hold , even if the support region of @xmath4 is scattered across the @xmath10-plane , as long as the total support area satisfies @xmath1 .",
