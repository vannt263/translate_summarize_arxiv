    "the utmost nanotechnology , that is , a method to manipulate a single atom and/or molecule adsorbed on a solid surface has been developed in the last twenty years as an impressive implementation of the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets).@xcite in a recent letter  @xcite we clarified the elementary processes behind one of the pioneering works on single molecule manipulation , the rotation of a single acetylene molecule on the cu(001 ) surface .",
    "@xcite however , the isotope effect in the acetylene / deuterated acetylene rotations on cu(001 ) also discovered in ref .",
    "was left beyond the scope of our letter .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to extend our approach of ref .   in order to give a comprehensive analysis of the stm - induced acetylene c@xmath0h@xmath0 and deuterated acetylene c@xmath0d@xmath0 rotations on cu(001 ) , with a special emphasis on the isotope effects .",
    "the work of stipe , rezaei , and ho  @xcite appeared to be the first thorough and systematic experiment on a single adsorbate manipulation made in combination with stm - iets .",
    "this has been established since then as an indispensable experimental method in order to gain insight into the vibrationally mediated motions and reactions of single molecules with stm ( see , e.g. , in ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "the work  @xcite was also the first where the responsible for modification vibrational mode was not directly excited by the tunneling electrons .",

    "h(d ) stretch mode .",
    "the peak in the @xmath3 plot agreed with the observed iets spectrum ( @xmath4 ) for both systems .",

    ", it is very different from , e.g. , the rotation of a single oxygen molecule on pt(111 ) surface,@xcite where the hindered rotational mode can be directly excited by the tunneling electrons.@xcite    the case of acetylene / cu(001 ) with an indirect reaction pathway is not unique , many other examples of indirect excitation of the reaction coordinate ( rc ) mode have been established , e.g. , the migration of co on pd(110).@xcite however , the rotation of c@xmath0h(d)@xmath0/cu(001 ) demonstrates many peculiar features .",
    "first of all there are the lower and higher thresholds at the bias voltage around 240250  mv and 360  mv for the acetylene rotation , and seemingly only a single threshold at 275  mv for the deuterated acetylene rotation . while it is easy to assign the higher threshold to the c ",
    "h(d ) stretch vibrational mode , the lower threshold and its absence in case of deuterated acetylene has not been previously discussed explicitly .",
    "secondly , the crossover from linear ( single electron process ) to nonlinear ( two - electron process ) dependencies of the rotation rate of the c@xmath0h@xmath0/cu(001 ) with increasing tunneling current has not been well understood .",
    "this nonlinearity becomes more pronounced with increasing the bias voltage .",
    "this is in contrast to the so - called coherent ladder climbing where reaction rate as a function of current approaches to a linear one with the increase of bias voltage .",
    "@xcite    previously , we have shown@xcite that for the c@xmath0h@xmath0/cu(001 ) the rotational probability can be divided into three partial processes @xmath5 where the rates @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the one- and two - electron processes with a higher threshold @xmath8  mv , and @xmath9 is the one - electron combination band process , initiated via inelastic emission by tunneling electron of a pair of acetylene on cu(001 ) vibrational excitations .",
    "we believe that such a splitting can be also done for the deuterated acetylene on cu(001 ) surface .",
    "in this paper we analyse the linear @xmath6 as well non - linear @xmath7 processes for both isotopologues of acetylene on cu(001 ) .",
    "we make the throughout analysis of their vibrational modes and estimate the anharmonic couplings between them .",
    "we also provide the explicit derivation of the excitation rate of the reaction coordinate mode via anharmonic couplings and make the comparison with the experimental results of ref .  .",
