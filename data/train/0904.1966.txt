    "hii galaxies ( or blue compact dwarfs , bcds ) are low - mass and metal - poor galaxies ( 1/50 - 1/3z@xmath7 ) , experiencing strong episodes of star formation , characterized by the presence of bright emission lines on a faint blue continuum @xcite . several studies ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown the existence of an old stellar population underlying the present burst in most of these galaxies , indicating that these objects are not young systems forming their first generation of stars .",
    "the star formation activity in hii galaxies is concentrated in several luminous star clusters ( @xmath21 - 30 pc in size ) spread over the galaxies .",
    "some of these clusters have been associated with super star clusters ( sscs ) , similar to those found in interacting galaxies , such as the antennae @xcite , and some local dwarf galaxies such as henize 2 - 10 @xcite and ngc 1569 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during their evolution",
    ", these clusters ionize the interstellar medium ( ism ) causing the formation of giant hii regions ( ghiirs ) , and release a considerable quantity of mechanical energy into the ism , characterized by supersonic motions ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sweeping up the surrounding medium , removing the gas and dust from the star formation site , while producing structures such as bubbles and supershells .",
    "ultimately , the evolution of these young clusters also causes the freshly produced metals to be dumped into the ism .",
    "oxygen and other @xmath4 elements are produced by massive stars ( @xmath158 - 10 m@xmath7 ) and are released into the ism during their supernova phase .",
    "these metals will be dispersed in the whole galaxy and mixed via hydrodynamic mechanisms in time scales of few 10@xmath16 yrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the spatial distribution of abundances of o , n , etc depends on the recycling time of the ism , the spatial variation of these abundances give important insights about these processes .",
    "the spatial distribution of emission line ratios and of the abundance of certain elements in dwarf galaxies have been studied by different authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these works the radial and spatial distribution of the o / h abundance , obtained from the analysis of their h ii regions ,",
    "have been used as a chemical evolution indicator .",
    "localized nitrogen self enrichment has been measured in a few cases and attributed to the action of strong winds produced by wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but no oxygen localized enrichment systems have been confirmed @xcite . in ghiirs , where only one star formation region is present , it is usually assumed that the abundance of the galaxy and their ism is well represented by the abundance of this single region , assuming that the metals are well mixed and distributed across the galaxy .",
    "the details of the structure of hii galaxies are important to understand their ionization mechanisms , star formation feedback and chemical enrichment .",
    "these issues have been actively addressed in studies of the brightest and nearest systems .",
    "the large and heterogeneous hii galaxy sample @xcite includes a significant number of far less studied objects at larger distances , with small apparent sizes and with relatively low surface brightness .",
    "typically , hii galaxies contain one or a few star formation regions , but h@xmath5 images @xcite of some compact objects have revealed that the central region probably hosts a myriad of unresolved star clusters .",
    "the present facilities , with high spatial resolution and high efficiency instruments on large telescopes ( 8 m ) , allow us to study these more distant objects to derive their observed properties and relate them to the better known nearby galaxies , thus having a handle on the intrinsic properties of star formation as well as possible evolutionary effects .",
    "in this paper we use integral field spectroscopy with gemini multi - object spectrograph and the integral field unit ( gmos - ifu ) at gemini south in order to study the spatial distribution of emission lines , their ratios , extinction , abundances and the kinematic properties of the gas in the interstellar medium of the compact dwarf galaxy um 408 .",
    "um 408 belongs to a subset sample of rare hii galaxies with low metal abundances ( i.e. z@xmath17 1/20 z@xmath7 ) with @xmath18 @xcite , compact morphology , and very small effective radius ( r@xmath19 ) of only 2.1 from previous morphology and surface brightness studies @xcite .",
    "on other hand , @xcite using high resolution spectroscopy derived an abundance of @xmath20 and hi observations @xcite reveal an hi mass of log(m@xmath21)=8.815 m@xmath7 .",
    "um 408 is cataloged by @xcite as a dwarf hii hot spot with a redshift of 0.012 ( v=3598 km s@xmath9 ) with coordinates ra@xmath22 11@xmath23 234 , dec@xmath24",
    "20@xmath25 30(j2000 ) at a distance of @xmath2 46 mpc , and v apparent magnitude of 17.38 . with the present observations , we note that the central part of um 408 encompasses two main star formation regions ( here named a and b ) , as shown by the g - band acquisition images in figure [ image ] .",
    "another faint region , called c , can be seen in the outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "these regions were all unresolved in previous studies .        the observations and data reduction procedures are discussed in section [ obser ] .",
    "section [ results ] gives the results obtained from the 2d emission line maps . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss our results and our conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the observations were performed with the gemini multi - object spectrograph gmos @xcite and the ifu unit ( * ? ? ? * hereafter gmos  ifu ) at gemini south telescope in chile during the night of august 21 and december 31 2004 , using the grating b600@xmath26g5323 ( b600 ) and on january 01 , 2005 with the grating r600@xmath26g5324 ( r600 ) in one slit mode , covering a total spectral range from @xmath23021 to 7225 @xmath27 .",
    "the gmos - ifu in one slit mode composes a pattern of 750 hexagonal elements , each with a projected diameter of 0.2 , covering a total 3.5 @xmath35@xmath1 field of view , where 250 of these elements are dedicated to sky observation .",
    "the detector is formed by three 2048@xmath34608 ccds with 13.5 @xmath28 m pixels , with a scale of 0.073/pixel .",
    "the ccds create a mosaic of 6144@xmath34608 pixels with a small gap between the chips of 37 columns .",
    "table 1 shows the observing log , indicating the instrumental setup , airmass and exposure times , the dispersion , the final resolution and the seeing ( fwhm ) of each observation .",
    "the data were reduced using the gemini package version 1.8 inside iraf .",
    "all science exposures , comparison lamps and spectroscopic twilight and gcal flats were overscan / bias subtracted and trimmed .",
    "the spectroscopic gcal flats were processed by removing the calibration unit plus gmos spectral response and the calibration unit uneven illumination .",
    "twilight flats were used to correct for the illumination pattern in the gcal lamp flat using the task gfresponse in the gmos package .",
    "the twilight spectra were divided by the response map obtained from the lamp flats and the resulting spectra were averaged in the dispersion direction , giving the ratio of sky to lamp response for each fiber .",
    "the final response maps were obtained then by multiplying the gcal lamp flat by the derived ratio .",
    "the resulting extracted spectra were then wavelength calibrated , corrected by the relative fiber throughputs , and extracted .",
    "the residual values in the wavelength solution for 60 - 70 points using a 4@xmath29 or 5@xmath29 chebyshev polynomial typically yielded _",
    "rms _ values of @xmath20.10    and @xmath20.15    for both gratings respectively .",
    "the final spectra cover a wavelength interval of @xmath230215823   and @xmath243717225   for data taken with the b600 and r600 gratings , respectively .",
    "the final spectral resolutions and dispersions are shown in table 1 ( columns 5 and 6 ) .",
    "the flux calibration was performed using the sensitive function derived from observation of the star ltt 3864 for both gratings in december 31 and january 1 .",
    "standard stars were not observed in august .",
    "therefore , the blue part of the spectra was constructed using only the observation obtained in december 2004 .",
    "the 2d data images were transformed into 3d data cube ( x , y,@xmath11 ) using the _ gfcube _ routine and resampled as square pixels with 0.1 of spatial resolution .",
    "the emission line fluxes were measured using the iraf task _ fitprofs _ by fitting gaussian profiles . from these",
    ", we then created the emission line maps used in our analysis ( see section  [ results ] ) .    at shorter wavelength",
    "the ifu spectroscopy and long - slit observations suffer a spatial translation produced by differential atmospheric refraction ( dar ) .",
    "this effect is wavelength dependent , and is produced by the deviation of the light when it passes through the atmosphere due to the variation of the air density as a function of elevation . in order to obtain fluxes corrected of dar",
    ", we used a similar procedure as described in @xcite and also applied by @xcite .",
    "first we splitted the data cube in monochromatic images , and for each image we calculated the centroid of an unresolved point source in the field of view , that in our case corresponds to region a. finally , the various monochromatic maps were aligned by shifting the centroids to the same position .    in figure",
    "[ spec ] we show the resultant spectrum for the two gratings used , obtained from the sum of all gmos - ifu fibers .",
    "figure [ speczoom ] shows a detailed view of the selected emission lines considered in this study .",
    "the spectral resolution of the gmos - ifu observations allow us to resolve the [ oii]@xmath103726,29 doublet lines in a limited number of apertures with a @xmath30=2.32 @xmath31 between the peak of the lines in the integrated spectrum ( see figure [ speczoom ] ) .",
    "the low intensity of [ oii]@xmath103726,29 lines and [ oiii]@xmath114363 are the largest sources of uncertainties in our results .",
    "an automatic procedure to measure these emission line fluxes was not possible , therefore these lines were measured manually using _ splot_.",
    "we used a flux measurement procedure described in the previous section to produce the maps for the following emission lines : [ sii]@xmath116731 , [ sii]@xmath116717 , [ nii]@xmath116584 , h@xmath4 , [ oiii]@xmath115007 , [ oiii]@xmath114959 , h@xmath5 , [ oiii]@xmath114363 , h@xmath32 , [ oii]@xmath103726,29 , h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 continuum and ew(h@xmath5 ) , in a rectangular field of 3@xmath34@xmath1.4 ( see figure [ image ] ) . in order to reduce the number of data points without loosing spatial information and s / n , the data were resampled to 0@xmath1.2 in spatial resolution .",
    "typical s / n ratios for individual pixels ( spaxels in our data cube ) for [ oiii]@xmath115007 are @xmath33700 and @xmath33 500 for regions a and b , respectively . the [ oiii]@xmath114363 line shows a typical s / n ratio @xmath338 and @xmath334 for regions a and b , respectively .",
    "the signal to noise for each emission line is given by the ratio between the emission line peak and the rms of the adjacent continuum .",
    "figure [ line1 ] shows some of the observed emission line maps .",
    "all emission and continuum maps in this figure are in units of @xmath3 10@xmath34 erg @xmath35 s@xmath9 , except for the h@xmath5 equivalent width map , which is in units of @xmath36 . here",
    "0@xmath1.2 @xmath37 50 pc ( distances in this work were computed assuming a hubble constant of h@xmath38=72 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 ) .",
    "since most of the emission lines were measured using an automatic procedure , we filtered the maps assigning the value 0 erg @xmath35s@xmath9 to all pixels with s / n@xmath173 .    the maps in figure [ line1 ] show essentially the same spatial distribution , presenting two well defined and regular regions , that we have labeled a and b. the maximum peak intensity of the h@xmath4 emission line in region a is indicated in the maps by an x symbol . the recombination lines h@xmath4 ,",
    "h@xmath5 and h@xmath32 have very similar spatial distribution to the forbidden lines in figure [ line1 ] , but there is a slight difference in the spatial distribution of [ oiii]@xmath114363 and [ oii]@xmath103726,29 over region b. the last two images in figure [ line1 ] corresponds to the spatial distribution of the h@xmath5 continuum and the ew(h@xmath5 ) , respectively .",
    "it is clear from the maps that the continuum peak is not coincident with the maximum in h@xmath4 emission .",
    "this has been previously reported by other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in some galaxies with single and multiple star forming regions . in ngc 4214 , @xcite and @xcite found that the continuum peak emission was displaced in relation to the line emitting regions where a strong wolf - rayet ( wr ) feature ( heii @xmath114686   ) was also seen .",
    "no wr signatures were detected in the spectra of um 408 .",
    "the largest ew(h@xmath5 ) values in the galaxy are associated with region a , indicating that this region is younger than region b. on the other hand , the h@xmath5 continuum map ( see figure [ line1 ] ) shows the largest values over region b. in section  [ discussion ] , the ew(h@xmath5 ) values are used as a proxy for the starburst ages in order to derive the integrated physical properties of the galaxy and their star forming regions .",
    "the error associated to each emission line ( @xmath39 ) was calculated using the relationship given in @xcite :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the standard deviation in the local continuum associated to each emission line , @xmath42 is the number of pixels , ew is the equivalent width of the line and @xmath43 is the instrumental dispersion in @xmath36 ( see table 1 [ obslog ] ) .",
    "these estimated errors will be used later in the derivation of uncertainties in the oxygen abundance determination and integrated properties .",
    "finally , given that the seeing was 0.8 - 0.9@xmath1 ( @xmath24 pixels in the emission line maps ) , each aperture or pixel of 0.2@xmath1 should be correlated with its neighbor , and the pixel - to - pixel variations in the maps produced from the observed emission line are likely due to the uncertainties attached to the measurement and do not represent real variations .",
    "therefore , we smoothed the emission line ratio , temperature and oxygen abundance maps using a 3@xmath33 box .",
    "/h@xmath5 ratios .",
    "the regions enclosed by circles mark the location of other extinction peaks , probably related to other unresolved star clusters .",
    "the maximum h@xmath4 emission is placed over region a and is indicated by an x symbol .",
    "h@xmath4 contours are overplotted on the maps . ]",
    "the logarithmic reddening parameter c(h@xmath5 ) was calculated from the ratio h@xmath4/h@xmath5 , where the intrinsic value of 2.87 for case b recombination was assumed .",
    "thus , the corrected emission lines are calculated as    @xmath44    where i(@xmath11 ) and f(@xmath11 ) are the dereddened flux and observed flux at a given wavelength , respectively and f(@xmath11 ) is the reddening function given by @xcite as parametrized by @xcite , using appropriated values for the milky way @xcite .",
    "figure [ extinction ] shows the smoothed spatial distribution of c(h@xmath5 ) for the emission line ratios mentioned above .",
    "the reddening parameters c(h@xmath5 ) were set to 0.0 for unrealistic values of h@xmath4/h@xmath5 @xmath17 2.87 .",
    "we observe a range of extinction of @xmath20.02 to 1.04 with average c(h@xmath5 ) value of 0.76 and a standard deviation of 0.17 .",
    "the lowest extinction values are located in the outer part of the field of view ( see figure [ extinction ] ) .",
    "we note also that the maximum extinction c(h@xmath5 ) is close to , but not coincident with the peak of h@xmath4 emission .",
    "a similar result has been reported by @xcite and @xcite for the star formation knots in the galaxies ngc 4214 and mrk 370 , respectively .",
    "apparently , the current starburst episode in this galaxy is sweeping the gas and dust out of the center into the surrounding regions .",
    "the emission line distribution as well as the c(h@xmath5 ) distribution over region a and its elongated shape suggest that this region may contain two or more star forming complexes instead of only one .",
    "these complexes are indicated with circles in the extinction maps .",
    "finally , as the extinction across the galaxy does not show a uniform distribution , concentrating the highest values around the star forming regions , the fluxes of each pixel in the emission line maps were corrected using their corresponding c(h@xmath5 ) value .",
    "the standard bpt diagnostic diagrams @xcite have been used to analyze the possible excitation mechanisms present in um 408 .",

    "red and green crosses correspond to regions a and b , respectively , and the black crosses correspond to the outer parts of the galaxy . the integrated value that represents the sum over all spaxels in our field of view is given by the blue star symbol .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ diag ] divides the diagram into two regions that correspond to line ratios explained solely by photoionization by massive stars and to line ratios where an additional source of excitation must be present , as in the case of active galactic nuclei ( agns ; * ? ? ?",

    "we conclude that the hii regions in um 408 are produced by photoionization by massive stars .",
    "the first step in the abundance derivation is to obtain the electron density and temperature .",

    "the values for regions a and b have been calculated by taking the average over all pixels in each region . using these ew(h@xmath5 ) values we can estimate the cluster ages by comparison with the values obtained from starburst99 model @xcite .",
    "the resulting ages assuming an instantaneous burst and a metallicity of z=0.004 for a salpeter imf with a mass limit of 1m@xmath7 to 100m@xmath7 are 4.83 myrs and 5.00 myrs for regions a and b , respectively . these ages are consistent with both regions being formed simultaneously .",
    "we found integrated luminosities ( assuming a distance of d=46.8 mpc ; pustilnik et al . 2002 ) of log l(h@xmath4)=39.15 , 38.58 and 39.47 erg s@xmath9 for regions a and b and for the integrated galaxy , respectively .",
    "these correspond to a star formation rate of sfr=0.011 , 0.003 and 0.024 m@xmath7 yr@xmath9 , and with a number of ionizing photons log q(h@xmath63)=51.01 , 50.45 and 51.34 photons s@xmath9 for regions a , b and for the integrated galaxy , obtained from the relationships given by @xcite .",
    "the masses of these regions can be estimated by scaling the number of ionizing photons with the models predicted for the corresponding ages .",
    "the stellar masses are 5.17 @xmath3 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 and 2.29 @xmath3 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 for regions a and b , respectively . table [ integrated ] shows the derived integrated properties of the galaxy and its star forming regions .",
    "since its discovery , um 408 was classified as a low abundance galaxy with an integrated value of 12+log(o / h)=7.63 for low resolution spectroscopy @xcite and 7.93 for high resolution spectroscopy @xcite . in this work , we found an integrated abundance ( summing over all spaxels in our field of view ) of 12+log(o / h)=7.87@xmath130.05 .",
    "the synthetic apertures previously mentioned , yield an integrated oxygen abundance of 12+log(o / h)=7.82@xmath130.05 and 7.84@xmath130.06 for regions a and b , respectively .",
    "measuring the abundance in an aperture equivalent with the area where the emission line [ oiii]@xmath114363 was measured we obtain a value of 7.81@xmath130.05 , the same value obtained in the peak of the h@xmath4 emission ( see figure [ abun]b ) .",
    "this result reflects the fact that the integrated values are light weighted and dominated by the galaxy peak emission .    finally , despite the fact that a detailed kinematic analysis is beyond the scope of the present paper , our results confirm that the core dominates the kinematic information of the star forming region , and present a low @xmath14 value , as found by other works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". therefore , a single gaussian fit to the line profile of any aperture encompassing the brightest knot will measure a representative line width of the dominant supersonic motions , somewhat deconvolved by the effects of stellar and sn mechanical energy input .",
    "the effects of stellar or sn feedback will contribute to the broadening of the line profiles , but will only be detectable in the lower density regions at low intensities .",
    "one means to recognize these effects is through the identification of inclined bands in the diagnostic diagrams of intensity vs. @xmath14 as proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the compactness of um 408 and the small range of reliable line widths make the use of the diagnostic diagrams difficult to interpret in this case .",
    "the h@xmath4 line profile is symmetric and well represented by a single gaussian , and does not show prominent low intensity wings in either apertures .",
    "an attempt to deblend a possible additional component to this line profile produced only an upper limit of @xmath64 km s@xmath9 with @xmath65 .",
    "the uniform behavior of o / h abundance in scales of hundreds of pc in low mass galaxies as in um 408 is not without precedent , and is comparable with the observed variation in some dwarf galaxies by other authors . in ngc 4214",
    "( dwarf irregular / wolf - rayet galaxy ) @xcite showed that there is no localized o , n or he abundance gradients , but they found , near the youngest region , an oxygen overabundance of 0.095@xmath130.019 dex .",
    "@xcite , using long slit spectroscopy to study the interstellar medium of the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 1569 , failed to find evidence for o / h gradient from the recent star formation activity .",
    "@xcite studied the local group dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 6822 and measured a difference of @xmath12(o / h)=0.53 dex between the maximum ( 8.43@xmath130.2 ) and minimum value ( 7.90@xmath130.1 ) , with a mean oxygen abundance of 12+log(o / h)=8.11@xmath130.1 using only the hii regions where the [ oiii]@xmath114363 emission lines were detected .",
    "a gradient of -0.14@xmath130.07 dex kpc@xmath9 was measured by lee et al . in a radius",
    "@xmath511.4 kpc , and a slope of -0.16 dex kpc@xmath9 was obtained if measurements from the literature were included , showing the existence of a possible radial gradient in oxygen abundance .",
    "@xcite using vlt / giraffe in the argus mode , observed the dwarf galaxy sbs 0335 - 052e , one of the most metal poor galaxies with an integrated oxygen abundance of 12+log(o / h)=7.30 @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of the oxygen abundance in the ism of sbs 0335 - 052e vary from 7.00@xmath130.08 to 7.42@xmath130.02 , representing a difference of @xmath12(o / h)=0.42 dex .",
    "the maximum value of oxygen abundances in this galaxy does not correspond to the position of one of the identified sscs , but izotov et al .",
    "find a slight trend of a decreasing abundance , interpreted as possible self - enrichment .",
    "however , they argue that the errors in the calculated oxygen abundances and t@xmath47 , n@xmath47 , etc , not considering instrumental and observational uncertainties , lead to consider the oxygen abundance variations in sbs 0335 - 052e may not be statistically significant . more recently , using ifu - pmas observations",
    ", @xcite studied the spatial distribution of some metals over the galaxy iizw70 . in this study",
    "they find a difference of @xmath43(o / h)=0.40 dex between the maximum ( 8.05@xmath130.06 ) and minimum ( 7.65@xmath130.06 ) values of oxygen abundance . in the case of um 408 , the bulk of our observed data points are distributed in a region of @xmath132@xmath14 dispersion around the average value with a difference between the maximum and minimum values of 0.47 dex .",
    "this is , somewhat , in good agreement with previous results in other dwarf galaxies , using in some cases different techniques .",
    "we note that the gradient found in our work , calculated in a spatial scale of hundreds of pc , is similar to the gradients calculated in other studies in scales of kpc .",
    "finally , the two giant regions a and b show a difference of oxygen abundance of only @xmath43(o / h)=0.02 dex , which indicates that these regions show identical chemical properties within the errors . given the ages ( @xmath25 myr ) and stellar masses ( @xmath210@xmath6m@xmath7 ) of these regions",
    ", we expect that hundreds of sns have exploded , producing eventually localized enrichments .",
    "but the absence of chemical overabundances in the ism of um 408 and in the dwarf galaxies studied in the literature lead to conclude that the population of young clusters have not produce preferentially localized overabundances .",
    "these results are compatible with the interpretation that the newly synthesized metals from the current star formation episode may not be in the warm phase of the ism , and thus are not observed at optical wavelengths .",
    "the metals that are observed , however , ought to be from previous events , and may be well mixed and homogeneously distributed over the whole extent of this low mass and compact galaxy .",
    "note that in um 408 , there is no bar induced rotation , or shear , to produce the metal dispersal and mixing as in more massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus there must be another mechanism responsible for the large - scale dispersal and mixing with the ism .",
    "one such hydrodynamic mechanism for the transport and mixing of the metals produced by compact bursts of star formation into the ism has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "this model predicts that the energy injected by core - collapse supernovae change the physical conditions ( density and temperature ) of the interstellar medium , while undergoing a long excursion into the galactic volume .",
    "the injected matter is first thermalized , near the starburst , as it goes through a reverse shock .",
    "this generates the giant pressure that allows for the built up of superbubbles , kpc scale structures that may grow for up to 50 myr .",
    "afterwards , once the sn ii phase is over , the giant superbubble gas begins to cool down by radiation .",
    "this happens first within the parcels of gas that present the largest densities , promoting their thermal instability .",
    "the sudden loss of pressure within densest parcels of gas would immediately trigger the appearance of re - pressurizing shocks emanating from the low density hot gas .",
    "the process leads to a plethora of dense condensations that inevitably will fall and settle within the main body of the galaxy .",
    "the process of cooling and dispersal onto the main body of the galaxy will occur within a few 10@xmath66 yr . for a complete mixing",
    ", the model assumes that a further star formation episode has to occur and through photoionization the metal enrich condensations will expand and be fully mixed with the ism ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this scenario seems plausible and compatible with our analysis for the case of um 408 .",
    "we used gmos - ifu spectrum of the compact hii galaxy um 408 , in order to derive the spatial distribution of emission line ratios , extinction c(h@xmath5 ) , radial velocity v@xmath52 , velocity dispersion @xmath14 , electron temperature and oxygen abundance ( o / h ) as well the integrated properties over an extended region of 3@xmath674@xmath1.4 equivalent to 750 @xmath3 1100 pc in the central part of the galaxy .",
    "below , we summarize our results and conclusions .    1",
    ".   the observed region of the galaxy includes two giant hii regions not resolved in previous studied , here labelled a and b. the sizes of these ionized regions are @xmath2375 and @xmath2250 pc for regions a and b , respectively . another region labelled c was found to the east of region b. we do not observe large scale structures as in other ghiirs and hii galaxies in the monochromatic maps .",
    "the distribution of dust content in the galaxy was derived from the balmer line decrement ( h@xmath4/h@xmath5 ) .",
    "the c(h@xmath5 ) distribution concentrates the highest values close but not coincident with the peak of h@xmath4 emission in each ionized cluster ( a and b ) .",
    "the dust seems to be displaced from the star formation regions by the action of the star cluster winds .",
    "we used [ oiii]/h@xmath5 and [ sii]/h@xmath4 ratios to investigate the possible excitation mechanism over the ism of the galaxy . comparing the data points in the diagnostic diagram with the theoretical model given by @xcite",
    ", we found that all measured h@xmath4 flux arises from gas photoionized by massive stars 4 .",
    "the velocity field ( v@xmath52 ) shows an apparent systemic motion where the east part of the galaxy ( near knot b ) is blueshifted , while the west part ( near knot a ) is redshifted , with a relative motion of @xmath8 km s@xmath9 and a difference between the maximum a minimum values of @xmath233 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the velocity dispersion map shows supersonic values , typical for extragalactic hii regions , ranging values from @xmath8 km s@xmath9 to @xmath59 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the ages of the two giant regions detected in this study , were estimated from their ew(h@xmath5 ) and the starburst99 models , suggesting that they are coeval events of @xmath25 myr with stellar masses of @xmath210@xmath6 m@xmath7 .",
    "we see a marginal difference in the integrated oxygen abundance between these regions of @xmath43(o / h)=0.02 dex .",
    "6 .   finally ,",
    "as found in other nearby dwarf galaxies , we do not observe a gradient in oxygen abundance across the compact galaxy um 408 .",
    "the bulk of the observed data points are lying in a region of @xmath132@xmath14 dispersion ( @xmath14=0.1 dex ) ; therefore , the new metals formed in the current star formation episodes are not observed and reside probably in the hot gas phase ( t@xmath210@xmath68 k ) , whereas the metals from previous star formation events are well mixed and homogeneously distributed through the whole extent of the galaxy .",
    "all results presented here are suggestive that um 408 is an unevolved low metallicity dwarf galaxy , undergoing a simultaneous episode of star formation over the whole optically observed extension , and it is a genuine example of the simplest starbursts occurring in galactic scale , possibly mimicking the properties one expects for young galaxies at high redshift .",
