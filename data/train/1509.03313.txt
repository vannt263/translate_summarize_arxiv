    "over the years , transition metal oxides have represented a traditional platform for strongly correlated electron physics , which has nowadays become a field of its own , encompassing several classes of compounds with one common denominator : the localized character of the low - energy electronic wavefunctions ( with @xmath1 or @xmath2 orbital character ) and the corresponding prominence of coulomb interactions in driving the electronic properties of these materials . in conventional metals or semiconductors , the fermiology is essentially determined by the lowering of the total kinetic energy which becomes possible when a periodic potential supports the delocalization of the local orbitals into extended wavefunctions with a well - defined momentum and a correspondigly homogeneous distribution of the charge density . in correlated electron systems , the on - site coulomb repulsion between two electrons in the same @xmath1 or @xmath2 orbital can overcome the kinetic energy part of the hamiltonian , inducing the electronic system to find new ways to lower its total energy , often by spontaneous breaking of the native symmetries of the lattice ( translational and/or point group symmetry ) .",
    "this tendency leads to the emergence of a rich variety of symmetry - broken electronic phases , and represents a distinctive trademark of strongly correlated systems , spanning across families of compounds otherwise very different from a chemical standpoint @xcite .    within the extended class of correlated electron systems ,",
    "copper oxides represent a unique breed due to the mixed character of the electronic bands , frustrated by the conflicting interplay between the o-@xmath3 states  promoting itinerancy and electron hopping  and the cu-@xmath4 states  which hinder charge fluctuations and are conducive to mott - hubbard physics and an insulating , antiferromagnetic ( af ) ground state @xcite .",

    "these different types of order can involve both the charge sector ( nematic state for @xmath5 , and charge - density - wave for @xmath6 ) and the spin sector ( @xmath5 magnetic order , and spin - density - wave or antiferromagnetism with @xmath6 ) , leading to several proposed forms of intertwined electronic orders @xcite .      in this review",
    "we will focus on charge order , which is defined as an electronic phase breaking translational symmetry via a self - organization of the electrons into periodic structures incompatible with the periodicity of the underlying lattice .",

    "however , due to the spectrometer - characteristic finite energy resolution @xmath196 ( which in the soft x - ray regime ranges between 30mev and 1ev , while hard x - ray spectrometers reach down to 1mev ) , purely elastic scattering can not be experimentally accessed , and it is more appropriate to use the term quasi - elastic scattering , which probes a regime which is static up to a timescale @xmath197 .",
    "from a more practical standpoint , the energy - integrated measurement in most cases yields a reliable representation of the momentum structure of the ordered state , due to fact that the inelastic part of the spectra usually evolves very smoothly and can be discarded as background in rxs , especially if it exhibits a different temperature dependence with respect to the zero energy - loss feature ( see also discussion of fig.[rsxs_ybco_ghiringhelli_fig ] ) .",

    "the first generation of soft x - ray diffractometers also includes two additional rotational degrees of freedom ( denominated @xmath207 and @xmath208 , see again fig.[mechanism_rsxs]c ) , allowing a fine alignment of the sample axes with respect to the scattering plane ( however , @xmath207 and @xmath208 typically cover a limited angular range of @xmath209 to @xmath210 ) .",

    "diffractometers with more circles ( up to 6  3 for the sample , 3 for the detector ) covering an ample angular range are routinely used at higher photon energies ( hard x - rays , @xmath211kev ) , where the added complication of the all - vacuum environment required for soft x - rays is lifted .",

    "in addition , since core states are very tightly bound to their parent nucleus , in a conventional diffraction experiment one mainly probes the ionic lattice in reciprocal space , which is why xrd is used primarily for structural studies . in the second case",
