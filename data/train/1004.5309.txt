    "experiments reporting the accumulation of flux in the center of a superconductor sample immediately after first flux penetration can not be taken as evidence for the presence of a geometrical barrier ; such observations merely reflect the fact that the sample center corresponds to the location of minimal vortex free energy , a situation that stems from the macroscopic distribution of the meissner current and is therefore true regardless of the origin of the barrier .",
