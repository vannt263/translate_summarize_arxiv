    "sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] contain our results along with a discussion . finally , in the last section we present our conclusions .",
    "the three - state majority - vote model with noise is defined by a set of spin variables \\{@xmath13 } , where each spin is associated to one vertex of an erds - rnyi s random graph and can have the values @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the connectivity of a vertex is defined as the total number of bonds connected to it , that is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 if there is a link between the sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 otherwise . a random graph is completely characterized by the mean number of connections per site , _ i.e. _ the average connectivity @xmath1 , and the total number of sites @xmath21 .",
    "the system evolves in time according to the following rules : for each spin we determine the state of the majority of its neighboring spins , that is , all the spins that are linked to it .",
    "with probability @xmath6 the new state of the spin agrees with the majority state of its neighbors and it disagrees with probability @xmath7 , which is known as the noise parameter . in the case of a tie between the three possible states ,",
    "each state is chosen with equal probability @xmath22 . in the case of a tie between two majority states ,",
    "the spin assumes each one of these states with equal probability @xmath23 , and the minority state with probability @xmath7 .",
    "finally , in the case of a single majority state , the two minority states occur with equal probability @xmath24 , and the majority state with probability @xmath6 .",
    "it is clear that the rules just described present the @xmath25 symmetry with respect to the simultaneous change of all states @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the number of neighbors of site @xmath18 in state @xmath28 , therefore @xmath29 . according to the above rules we can write the following probabilities for a given spin to assume the state @xmath30 : @xmath31    the probabilities for the other two states are obtained by the symmetry operations of the @xmath25 group . for example ,",
    "let us consider a neighborhood corresponding to the fourth and fifth rules , where we have a single majority state . in this case , the two minority states ( say , states 2 and 3 ) occur with equal probability @xmath24 , and the majority state with probability @xmath32 .",
    "we can write @xmath33 from the fourth rule , and @xmath34 , from the fifth rule .",
    "it is worth mentioned that the condition @xmath35 (= probability of choosing the majority state 1 ) @xmath36 (= probability of choosing a minority state , either 2 or 3 ) is valid for @xmath37 , and we conclude that @xmath38 is the limit value for the noise parameter in the present three state mv model .",
    "moreover , the probabilities defined by eq.([rules ] ) satisfy @xmath39 .    to study the critical behavior of the model we consider the magnetization @xmath40 , the susceptibility @xmath41 , and the binder s fourth - order cumulant @xmath42 .",

    "we assume the following finite - size scaling ( fss ) relations @xcite @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 , and the universal scaling functions @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 only depend on the scaled variable @xmath60 .",
    "the above fss relations follow from the _ ansatz _ that the correlation length scales with the number of nodes in the graph , that is @xmath61 , which is consistent with an effective dimensionality equal to unity .    from the size dependence of @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    "we can obtain the exponents @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the correlation length exponent @xmath62 is calculated from the size dependence of the derivative of binder s fourth - order cumulant with respect to the noise parameter , @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , we use the hyperscaling relation @xmath64 to estimate the effective dimensionality of the system @xmath65 in order to check the fss prediction for an effective dimensionality equal to unity .",

    "in this case @xmath70 and @xmath71 , thus @xmath72 .",
    "it is also straightforward to check that @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .    in the opposite limit ( @xmath12 ) the system reaches a disordered steady state , where the average of each component of the magnetization vanishes .",
