    "if the af order is instrumentation resolution limited in the nrse measurements , we would expect to find the width of the quasielastic scattering , @xmath70 , to be @xmath89ev .",
    "from the temperature dependence of @xmath70 , we see considerable broadening of the quasielastic scattering above 30 k [ fig .",

    "since our data are collected by rotating the crystals at fixed @xmath107 , we are effectively measuring the mosaic distribution of the longitudinally ordered af phase [ fig .",
    "to understand the microscopic origin of the incommensurate af phase , we consider two possibilities as sketched in figs .",
    "4(e ) and 4(f ) .",
    "if the ordered moments of the incommensurate phase are aligned along the longitudinal ( @xmath4-axis ) direction , the observed incommensurate scattering may be the mosaic distribution of the commensurate af phase in the matrix of the superconducting phase as shown in the green patches of fig .",
    "however , a mosaic distribution of the commensurate af phase should result in a broad peak centered at the af wave vector , in contrast to the observed transverse incommensurate af order .",
    "furthermore , such a model can not explain the magnitude or the doping dependence of the incommensurability .",
    "it also does not account for the expected orthorhombic lattice distortion in the incommensurate af phase .",
    "therefore , this model is unlikely to be correct description of the observsed incommensurate phase . alternatively , if the incommensurate af order arises from the moment amplitude modulation along the @xmath16-axis [ fig .",
    "4(f ) ] , an incommensurability of @xmath108 would require a spin - spin correlation length of @xmath7115 unit cells or @xmath7180  , only slightly larger than the observed @xmath7160   correlation length . in principle ,",
    "an @xmath4-axis aligned moment of the incommensurate af order can not exist in the tetragonal unit cell and must break the @xmath109 rotational symmetry of the underlying tetragonal crystalline lattice [ left inset in fig .",
    "1(a ) ] @xcite .",
    "when incommensurate af order is initially established below @xmath6 , one can observe clear orthorhombic lattice distortion in x - ray diffraction experiments @xcite . when superconductivity sets in below @xmath55 , the orthorhombic lattice distortion and intensity of incommensurate af peaks are gradually suppressed with decreasing temperature @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the picture that incommensurate af order is intimately associated with the orthorhombic lattice distortion . assuming optimal superconductivity in bafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 prefers a true tetragonal structure ,",
    "this means that the incommensurate af phase must be located in the orthorhombic lattice distorted patches in the matrix of the paramagnetic tetragonal phase below @xmath6 [ red region in fig .",
    "4(e ) ] . since the lattice distortion from the tetragonal to",
    "orthorhombic phase must be gradual , one can imagine a scenario where the incommensurate af order arises from the moment amplitude modulation along the @xmath16-axis coupled with the tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition [ red patch in fig .",
    "4(e ) and fig .",
    "4(f ) ] . below @xmath55 ,",
    "the volume fraction of the superconducting tetragonal phase grows with decreasing temperature the expense of the incommenusrate af orthorhombic phase .",
    "although we can not conclusively determine whether this picture is correct , it is consistent with a cluster spin glass ( or amplitude spin glass ) and much different from a spin - density wave in nested fermi surfaces .",
    "the identification that the short - range incommensurate af phase , a general feature in electron - doped iron pnictides @xcite , is a cluster spin glass challenges the notion that the static af order in iron pnictides arises from the itinerant electrons in nested fermi surfaces .",
    "furthermore , since incommensurate af order competes directly with superconductivity @xcite , one can envision a situation where the cluster spin glass coexists and competes mesoscopically with superconductivity near optimal electron - doping .",
    "while these results are consistent with @xmath110sr measurements on bafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 indicating that the disappearance of static magnetism with increasing @xmath7 is driven mainly by the loss of the volume fraction of the magnetically ordered region near optimal superconductivity @xcite , they are different from the underdoped regime where antiferromagnetism and superconductivity coexist homogeneously and compete for the same itinerant electrons @xcite . these results are also consistent with @xmath111fe m@xmath12ssbauer spectroscopy measurements on the same ni - doped bafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 @xcite . with increasing electron - doping , the long - range commensurate af order transforms into a cluster spin glass via the first order fashion . upon further doping ,",
    "the cluster spin glass is replaced by a homogeneous superconducting phase with tetragonal structure .",
    "the behavior of the incommensurate af ordered phase in bafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 is remarkably similar to those of the hole underdoped copper oxides superconductors such as la@xmath112sr@xmath113cuo@xmath114 @xcite and yba@xmath3cu@xmath115o@xmath116 @xcite , where the spin freezing temperature depends sensitively on the energy resolution of the probes .",
    "very recently , incommensurate charge ordering in underdoped copper oxides was also found to compete with superconductivity @xcite .",
    "these results , together with the present finding of a cluster spin glass phase in iron pnictides , suggest that the spin and charge ordering competing with superconductivity may be a general phenomenon in the phase diagram of doped high - transition temperature superconductors .",
