    "though the cosmic strings produced in phase transitions before or during early stages of inflation would have been drastically diluted by the expansion , the formation of defects during inflation can be triggered by a coupling of the symmetry breaking field to the inflaton field or to the curvature of the background spacetime ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the presence of a cosmic string in the period of inflation will lead to the modification of the power - spectrum for vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the cosmic string breaks the homogeneity of ds space and , as a result , the power - spectrum depends on the distance from the string . in the case of a scalar field",

    "an interesting topic for the further investigation is the influence of the fermionic fluctuations , discussed in the present paper , on the power - spectrum from the inflation .",
    "the latter is imprinted in the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the observational data on these anisotropies could constrain the density and the parameters of the cosmic strings at the end of inflation .",
