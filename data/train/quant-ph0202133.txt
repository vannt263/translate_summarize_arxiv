    "in this section we briefly describe the measurement - sensitivity limits due to heisenberg s uncertainty principle , and how , in general , quantum entanglement can be used to achieve this sensitivity .",
    "there are several stages in the procedure where quantum entanglement can be exploited , both in the state preparation and in the detection .",
    "first , we derive the heisenberg limit , then we give the usual shot - noise limit , and we conclude this section with entanglement enhanced parameter estimation .",
    "suppose we have a @xmath11-level system .",
    "furthermore , we use the angular momentum representation to find the minimum uncertainty @xmath12 in an observable @xmath13 that is a dual to the angular momentum operator @xmath14 .",
    "that is , @xmath13 and @xmath14 obey a heisenberg uncertainty relation ( @xmath15 :    @xmath16    when we want minimum uncertainty in @xmath13 ( minimal @xmath12 ) , we need to maximize the uncertainty in @xmath14 ( maximal @xmath17 ) . given the eigenstates @xmath18 of @xmath14 : @xmath19 , let us , for example , take the state of the form latexmath:[$|\\psi\\rangle = ( n+1)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\sum_{m =- n/2}^{+n/2 } e^{i\\phi_m }    @xmath14 .",
    "the variance in @xmath14 is then given by    @xmath21    it immediately follows that the leading term in @xmath22 scales with @xmath1 .",

    "( [ hur ] ) , i.e. , minimum uncertainty , and the expression for @xmath22 , we find that @xmath25 .",
    "by contrast consider a quantum state of the form @xmath26 , which is a binomial distribution of the eigenstates of @xmath14 . the variance in @xmath14 in this case",
    "is given by    @xmath27    which , then , corresponds to the usual shot - noise limit .",
    "this result gives the spread of measurement outcomes of an observable @xmath13 in a @xmath11-level system .",
    "however , it is not yet cast in the language of standard parameter estimation .",
    "the next question is therefore how to achieve this _ heisenberg - limited _ sensitivity when we wish to estimate the value of a parameter @xmath5 in @xmath1 trials .",
    "the shot - noise limit ( sl ) , according to estimation theory , is given by @xmath28 .",
    "we give a short derivation of this value and generalize it to the quantum mechanical case .",
    "consider an ensemble of @xmath1 two - level systems in the state @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the two levels .",
    "if @xmath32 is given by    @xmath33    when we repeat this experiment @xmath1 times , we obtain @xmath34    furthermore , it follows from the definition of @xmath35 that @xmath36 on the relevant subspace , and the variance of @xmath35 given @xmath1 samples is readily computed to be @xmath37 . according to estimation theory @xcite , we have    @xmath38    this is the standard variance in the parameter @xmath5 after @xmath1 trials . in other words , the uncertainty in the phase is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of trials .",
    "this is , then , the shot - noise limit .",
    "quantum entanglement can improve the sensitivity of this procedure by a factor of @xmath2 .",
    "we will first employ an entangled state    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are collective states of @xmath1 qubits , defined , for example , in the computational basis @xmath42 , @xmath43 , as         the relative phase @xmath44 can be obtained by a unitary evolution of one of the modes of @xmath45 . here , in the case of eq .",

    "( [ est ] ) again , we obtain the so - called heisenberg limit ( hl ) to the minimal detectable phase :    @xmath52    the precision in @xmath5 is increased by a factor @xmath2 over the standard noise limit .",

    "gyroscopy and entanglement - enhanced frequency measurements @xcite exploit the @xmath2 increased precision .",
    "the physical interpretations of @xmath54 and the phase @xmath5 will differ in the different protocols .",
    "in the following section we present three distinct physical representations of this construction .",
    "we call this the _ quantum rosetta stone_. of particular importance is the interplay between the created states @xmath45 and the measured observable @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ cosn ] ) . in section [ phasemeas ]",
    "we present three types of quantum states and observables that yield heisenberg - limited sensitivity .",
    "in this section we discuss the formal equivalence between the mach - zehnder interferometer , the ramsey spectroscope , and a logical quantum gate .    in a mach - zehnder interferometer @xcite , the input light field",
    "is divided into two different paths by a beam splitter , and recombined by another beam splitter .",
    "the phase difference between the two paths is then measured by balanced detection of the two output modes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig-1]a ) .",
    "a similar situation , which we will omit in our discussion , can be found in stern - gerlach filters in series @xcite , and the technical limitations of such a device has been discussed by englert , schwinger , and scully @xcite .    with a coherent laser field as the input",
    "the phase sensitivity is given by the shot noise limit @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the average number of photons passing though the interferometer during measurement time .",
    "when the number of photons is exactly known ( i.e. , the input is a fock state @xmath56 ) , the phase sensitivity is still given by @xmath0 , indicating that the photon counting noise does not originate from the intensity fluctuations of the input beam @xcite .",
    "in the next section we will see how we can improve this sensitivity .    in a ramsey spectroscope",
    ", atoms are put in a superposition of the ground state and an excited state with a @xmath7-pulse ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1]b ) . after a time interval of free evolution",
    ", a second @xmath7-pulse is applied to the atom , and , depending on the relative phase shift obtained by the excited state in the free evolution , the outgoing atom is measured either in the ground or the excited state . repeating this procedure @xmath1 times , the phase @xmath5 is determined with precision @xmath0 .",
    "this is essentially an atomic clock .",
    "both procedures are methods to measure the phase shift , either due to the path difference in the interferometer , or to the free - evolution time in the spectroscope .",
    "when we use entangled atoms in the spectroscope , we can again increase the sensitivity of the apparatus .",
    "v    a third system is given by a qubit that undergoes a hadamard transform @xmath57 , then picks up a relative phase and is then transformed back with a second hadamard transformation ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1]c ) .",
    "this representation is more mathematical than the previous two , and it allows us to extract the unifying mathematical principle that connects the three systems . in all protocols , the initial state is transformed by a discrete fourier transform ( beam splitter , @xmath7-pulse or hadamard ) , then picks up a relative phase , and is transformed back again .",
    "this is the standard `` quantum '' finite fourier transform , such as used in the implementation of shor s algorithm @xcite .",
    "it is not the same as the classical algorithm in engineering .    as a consequence ,",
    "the phase shift ( which is hard to measure directly ) is applied to the transformed basis .",
    "the result is a bit flip in the initial , _ computational _ , basis @xmath58 , and this is readily measured .",
    "we call the formal analogy between these three systems the _ quantum rosetta stone_.    the importance of the rosetta stone was that , by giving an example of writing in three different languages : greek , demotic , and hieroglyphics , it enabled the french scholar jean franois champollion to crack the code of the hieroglyphs , which was not understood until his work in 1822 @xcite . in discussing quantum computer circuits with researchers from the fields of quantum optics or atomic clocks , we find the `` quantum rosetta stone '' a useful tool to connect those areas of research to the language of quantum computing  which can be as indecipherable as hieroglyphs to such researchers",
    ".    these schemes can be generalized from measuring a simple phase shift to evaluating the action of a unitary transformation @xmath59 associated with a complicated function @xmath60 on multiple qubits . such an evaluation is also known as a quantum computation .",
    "quantum computing with generalized mach - zehnder interferometers has been proposed by milburn @xcite , and later linear optics quantum computation has been suggested by cerf , adami , and kwiat @xcite .",

    "implementations of quantum logic gates have also been proposed by using atoms and ion traps @xcite . according to our rosetta stone ,",
    "the concept of quantum computers is therefore to exploit quantum interference in obtaining the outcome of a computation of @xmath60 . in this light ,",
    "a quantum computer is nothing but a ( complicated ) multiparticle quantum interferometer @xcite .",
    "this logic may also be reversed : a quantum interferometer is therefore a ( simple ) quantum computer . often , when discussing , heisenberg - limited interferometry with complicated entangled states , one encounters the critique that such states are highly susceptible to noise and even one or a few uncontrolled interactions with the environment will cause sufficient degradation of the device and recover only the shot - noise limit @xcite",
    ". apply the _ quantum rosetta stone _ by replacing the term `` quantum interferometer '' with `` quantum computer '' and we recognize the exact same critique that has been leveled against quantum computers for years .",
    "however , for quantum computers , we know the response  to apply quantum error - correcting techniques and encode in decoherence free subspaces .",
    "quantum interferometry is just as hard as quantum computing",
    "! the same error - correcting tools that we believe will make quantum computing a reality , will also be enabling for quantum interferometry .",

    "<S> a similar improvement in measurement sensitivity can be achieved in the determination of frequency standards and spectroscopy ; an atomic clock using ramsey s separated - oscillatory - fields technique is formally equivalent to the optical mach - zhender interferometer . here </S>",
    "<S> , the two @xmath7-pulses represent the beam splitters . </S>",
    "<S> wineland and co - workers first showed that the best possible precision in frequency standard is obtained by using maximally entangled states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , it was shown by one of us ( jpd ) that this improved sensitivity can be exploited in atom - laser gyroscopes @xcite .    quantum lithography and microscopy </S>",
    "<S> is closely related to this enhanced sensitivity . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> the bottleneck for reading and writing with light is the resolution of the feature size , which is limited by the wavelength of the light used . in classical optical lithography </S>",
    "<S> the minimum feature size is determined by the rayleigh diffraction limit of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the wavelength of the light . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that this classical limit can be overcome by exploiting the quantum nature of entangled photons @xcite .    in classical optical microscopy </S>",
    "<S> too , the finest detail that can be resolved can not be much smaller than the optical wavelength . using the same entangled - photons technique , it is possible to image the features substantially smaller than the wavelength of the light . </S>",
    "<S> the desired entangled quantum state for quantum interferometric lithography yielding a resolution of @xmath10 has the same form of the maximally entangled state discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> 11 . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we present an overview of some aspects of the enhancement by quantum entanglement in interferometeric devices , and we describe another method for the generation of the desired quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows :    in section [ heisenberg ] , we discuss the heisenberg - limited sensitivity and the standard shot - noise limit . following previous work @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we then introduce phase estimation with quantum entanglement . in the next section ( [ rosetta ] ) , we describe a quantum rosetta stone , based on the formal equivalence between the mach - zehnder interferometer , atomic clocks , and a generic quantum logic circuit . in section [ phasemeas ] </S>",
    "<S> we discuss three different ways of achieving the heisenberg limit sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> a brief description of quantum interferometric lithography and the desired quantum state of light is given in section [ litho ] . in section </S>",
    "<S> [ projective ] we discuss quantum state preparation with projective measurements and its application to heisenberg - limited interferometry . </S>"
