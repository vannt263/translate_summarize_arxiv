    "a crucial element of quantum information processing ( qip ) and communication is measurement of a quantum system to access its information content , hence determining optimal measurements is important . as qip steps out from the pages of theory and into the laboratory ,",
    "one has to find implementations given the usual limited resources of the real world .",
    "the most general measurement one can perform on a quantum system is given by a positive operator valued measure ( povm )  @xcite which can be considered as a projective measurement on an extended hilbert space of which the original state resides on a ( proper ) sub - space .",
    "its realization via the neumark extension  @xcite requires , broadly speaking , that the extended hilbert space should have as many dimensions as there are possible outcomes of the povm .",
    "this has been described for atoms or ions  @xcite and for linear optics  @xcite , and povms have been realised on optically encoded quantum information  @xcite .    for many physical systems , however , it is difficult or impossible to find enough extra dimensions , let alone perform operations on the extended system , hence a more efficient method is desirable .",
    "recently , a method was discovered which allows an arbitrary povm to be performed by adding only a single extra dimension to a system , essentially checking the measurement outcomes one by one  @xcite .",
    "however , when the number of possible measurement outcomes becomes large , more time efficient measurement strategies , also carrying a minimal dimensional overhead , would be useful .",
    "it is clear that a sequence of partial conditional measurements implements a final effective povm with many elements  @xcite .",
    "here we show , given any povm , how to construct a suitable binary search tree of two - outcome povms by coupling the original system with a single qubit  ) was stated , but a linear search protocol implied . ] .",
    "this way , a measurement with @xmath0 outcomes can be implemented in @xmath1 steps , resulting in a significant speedup .",
    "existing experimental realizations could easily be adapted to this method  @xcite .",
    "a quantum measurement is often considered to be a projection in a complete basis of the @xmath2-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "however , many experimental measurements are not well described by this .",
    "more generally , we only require of a measurement that the outcome probabilities are positive and sum to one , and satisfy convex linearity over mixtures of states .",
    "this leads to the framework of generalized quantum measurements , where a measurement is represented by a set of positive operators @xmath3 , which sum to unity , @xmath4 .",
    "each outcome @xmath5 is associated with an operator @xmath6 , and occurs with probability @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 is the measured state . hence a generalized measurement is usually called a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) or probability operator measure ( pom ) .    the neumark extension provides a way of performing any povm via projective measurements , albeit in an extended space . without loss of generality ,",
    "assume that each measurement operator @xmath6 is proportional to a one - dimensional projector @xmath9 where @xmath10 is not neccessarily normalized  . if @xmath11 is the number of outcomes and @xmath2 the dimension of the hilbert space , then @xmath12 will hold . if we form the @xmath13 rectangular array @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the computational basis",
    ", then the completeness relation implies that the columns of @xmath16 are orthonormal @xmath11-dimensional vectors .",
    "hence @xmath16 can be completed to an @xmath11-dimensional unitary matrix @xmath17 whose @xmath18 row represents a state @xmath19 in an @xmath11-dimensional extended hilbert space .",
    "the normalized projector @xmath20 corresponds to outcome @xmath5 for the original system .",
    "this procedure corresponds to applying @xmath21 to the extended hilbert space in which the original system is embedded , and then making a projective measurement in the computational basis .",
    "if @xmath11 is large , it may be infeasible to manipulate the required extended quantum system all at once , and we will therefore look at a way to reduce the number of ancillary dimensions by making sequential measurements .",
    "the @xmath22 are sufficient to determine the measurement probabilities , but the post - measurement state is not uniquely defined . however , for any _ realization _ we can find kraus operators @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , which tell us how the quantum state is affected  @xcite .",
    "if outcome @xmath5 is obtained , then the quantum state @xmath8 is transformed to @xmath25 $ ] . a subsequent measurement ,",
    "in general depending on the outcome @xmath5 , acts on this transformed state .",
    "a series of measurements can be viewed as an effective single generalized measurement , the sequence of outcomes determining the cumulative measurement operator .",
    "if the sequence @xmath26 of outcomes have @xmath27 and @xmath28 as corresponding measurement and kraus operators , then the final effective measurement operator and kraus operator are given by    @xmath29    here we assume that the measurement operators and the kraus operators are @xmath30 operators , i.e. the measurements map the system to a hilbert space of the same dimension  . hence , a sequence of measurements requires non - destructive measurement , e.g. indirect measurement of a system by measuring a probe after it has interacted with the system .",
    "a series of binary outcome measurements is shown in figure  [ fig : seq ] .",
    "the simplest probe is a two - level system ( qubit ) , giving a binary measurement , a @xmath2-level probe allowing a @xmath2-outcome measurement .",
    "a unitary operator couples the probe with the system , e.g. via a coupling hamiltonian over a set period . this in general entangles the state of the probe with the state of the system .",
    "measuring the probe performs an indirect measurement of the system . from the stinespring dilation  @xcite , this effectively implements a completely positive map with kraus operators given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the computational basis of the probe .",
    "outcome @xmath5 corresponds to the measurement operator @xmath33 and the conditional post - measurement state is @xmath34}.\\ ] ] by choosing suitable unitaries , any binary outcome povm can be implemented at each stage .",
    "conditioned on the result of the first measurement , a second measurement is performed , a third , and so on ( fig .",
    "[ fig : seq ] ) .",
    "this builds up a binary measurement tree with each pair of branches representing a different binary povm , depending on the previous results .",
    "each node represents the effective measurement operator ( given by eq .",
    "[ eq : seq ] ) obtained at that point .",
    "hence , after @xmath1 measurements , the effective povm may have as many as @xmath35 elements at the lowest level for a @xmath2-level probe .",
    "interacts with the measured system @xmath8 via unitaries .",
    "the probe is measured in the computational basis .",
    "subsequent measurements , determined by @xmath36 , are conditional upon the preceding results @xmath37 .",
    "the probe is reset before each measurement.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "it is easy to build up povms with many elements from a binary measurement tree .",
    "however , given an arbitrary povm with elements @xmath6 , constructing such a measurement tree which implements it is not so obvious . here",
    "we show how it may be done .",
    "it is instructive to look at the simplest non - trivial binary povm tree with @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fourpovm ] ) .",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the binary measurement operators performed at the first and second stage , and @xmath41 denote the cumulative measurement operators .",
    "the following should hold , where @xmath42 :    @xmath43    let us take @xmath44 , @xmath45 and use the ansatz @xmath46 where the moore - penrose pseudo - inverse @xmath47 of an operator @xmath48 is uniquely defined by  @xcite    @xmath49    we shall prove that the @xmath50 so constructed correspond to povm operators and solve the task .     are given by the @xmath51 measurements at each step .",
    "we want to determine what binary measurements @xmath51 are required to implement @xmath52.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    first , since @xmath53 is a positive operator , @xmath54 , with positive eigenvalues @xmath55 and corresponding eigenvectors @xmath56 ; @xmath57 is the rank of @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath58 are positive operators and @xmath59 , so the null space of @xmath60 is contained in the null spaces of @xmath58 , hence @xmath61 for some @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , @xmath63 for some @xmath64 .",
    "we can expand @xmath65 for some unitary @xmath66 , similarly @xmath67 .",
    "hence , we can see that @xmath68 in general , completeness of @xmath69 requires us to modify our original ansatz by adding an extra operator , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is an isometry on the null space of @xmath72 and the coefficients satisfy @xmath73 .",
    "we have defined @xmath74 so that @xmath75 . with this slight modification , it is easy to show that @xmath76 .    .",
    "a sequence of binary outcomes with measurement operators @xmath77 leads to the measurement @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "half of the possible results in the branches below are eliminated at each step.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for a general povm @xmath80 with @xmath81 elements , we first pad the set with null operators until it contains @xmath11 elements for @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tree ] ) . in a convenient change of notation ,",
    "the cumulative povm at the @xmath83 level consists of @xmath84 operators @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a sequence of @xmath87 numbers indicating which of the possible outcomes @xmath88 sit in the corresponding branches below .",
    "a binary povm @xmath89 splits each node into two possible branches , each containing half of the remaining outcomes .",
    "we now determine the binary povms @xmath51 which take us from a higher to lower branch .    at the first level , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . at the second level , from the previous section",
    "we have @xmath92 where we have absorbed the normalization of the @xmath93 operators . at subsequent levels",
    ", we can express the required binary povms as    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the concatenation of the strings @xmath96 and @xmath97 . at the last level @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "note that the unitary freedom @xmath100 leaves the observed probabilities invariant but simply rotates the post - selected states after each measurement .    for an @xmath11 element povm",
    ", we need only a probe qubit and @xmath101 rounds of binary measurements .",
    "let us determine the number of operations required to implement this measurement compared to other methods .",
    "for a measurement with @xmath11 outcomes on a @xmath2-dimensional quantum system , the standard neumark extension requires a @xmath102 unitary transform .",
    "this can be realized with @xmath103 operations between pairs of basis states  @xcite , followed by a projective measurement in the @xmath11-dimensional space .",
    "the realization using just a single extra degree of freedom @xcite requires a @xmath104 unitary transform to be implemented a maximum of @xmath105 times , giving in total a maximum of @xmath106 operations  .",

    "b ) the second ( projective ) measurements depend on the outcome of the first measurement .",
    "if @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) was obtained , then @xmath112 ( @xmath112 ) is measured .",
    "the second binary measurements are projective measurements in the plane perpedicular to the directions of the first measurement and the @xmath113 lie in the direction of the projection of the @xmath6 upon this plane.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as an example of the method , consider the symmetric informationally complete povm of a single qubit , the so - called tetrad measurement , with measurement operators @xmath9 given by  @xcite    @xmath114    although the tetrad povm can be performed in one projective step with the addition of just one extra qubit , it is instructive to demonstrate the binary tree approach using this example .    at the first stage , we are free to choose which two final measurement operators to group together , for instance ,    @xmath115    we are also free to choose the kraus operators @xmath116 using the singular value decomposition . for example ,    @xmath117    where the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are    @xmath118    although @xmath110 and @xmath111 share their eigenbases , we need a full @xmath119 neumark extension binary povm so that the post - measurement state is ready for the next stage .",
    "we couple the system via @xmath120 to a auxiliary probe qubit prepared in the state @xmath121 .",
    "then , projecting the probe onto states @xmath121 and @xmath122 corresponds to operations @xmath123 and @xmath124 on the system .",
    "a suitable coupling @xmath120 is constructed by making a @xmath125 neumark extension of the two - column matrix with its first two rows given by @xmath126 , and last two rows by @xmath127 . in the basis @xmath128 ,",
    "one possible @xmath120 is @xmath129    in this example , the positive operators @xmath130 are invertible so the @xmath131 for the next step are easily obtained as    @xmath132    which gives @xmath133 the @xmath131 are rank one operators but are not hermitian .",
    "we can visualize the sequence of measurements on the bloch ball ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tetrad ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , we provide a constructive proof of the universality of sequential two - outcome povms .",
    "we show how to construct binary measurement trees to implement any generalized measurement through a sequence of indirect binary povms requiring only an extra auxiliary qubit .",
