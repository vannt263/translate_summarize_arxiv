    "the nuclear physics data accumulated up to now indicate that there is an essential difference between spherical and nonspherical nuclei .",
    "this difference does not reduce merely to  nuclear shape effects \" as such , but intimately involves the internal structure of the nucleus .",
    "the shell oscillations of nuclear masses [ 1 ] can serve as an example of the phenomena associated with the difference between the structures of spherical and nonspherical nuclei .",
    "the shell oscillations are due to the ordered grouping of one - quasiparticle levels in spherical nuclei that arises because of the existence of the orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath0 of the quasiparticle [ 1,2 ] .",
    "there is no such ordered grouping in nonspherical nuclei , and the trend of the mass of such nuclei as a function of the number of nucleons is entirely different .",
    "this difference is manifested on a plot of nuclear masses versus number of nucleons as a break in the curve corresponding to a phase transformation from the normal phase ( nonspherical nuclei ) to the  magic phase \" ( spherical nuclei ) [ 3 ] .",
    "the difference between the internal structures of spherical and nonspherical nuclei does not affect only the ground states : the thermodynamic properties of the two phases are also different .",
    "this difference is manifested , for example , in the dependence of the form of the spectra of the @xmath1-ray cascades emitted by heated nuclei on phase of the compound nucleus [ 4,5 ] .",
    "the energy spectrum of a nonspherical nucleus is not distorted by the residual interaction and is essentially of the fermi - liquid type .",
    "spherical nuclei , on the other hand , apparently can not exist without the residual interaction ( this was proved in [ 6 ] for a very simple nuclear model ) , and this interaction has an important effect on their thermodynamic behavior . as was explained in [ 2 ] , the residual interaction must have a certain macroscopic structure , the only interactions between the quasiparticles that are compatible with the observed pattern of the shell oscillations of nuclear masses being those that lead to a quadratic dependence of the width of the diffuse region of the fermi distribution on the orbital angular momentum @xmath0 of the quasiparticle : @xmath2    in this paper we consider the thermodynamics of spherical nuclei on the basis of the simplest model of the residual interaction that has the required macroscopic structure .",
    "the racah - mottelson model was used in [ 2 ] to describe the residual interaction : the hamiltonian for the interaction between quasiparticles on the same @xmath3 level is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the creation and annihilation operators for a quasiparticle whose angular momentum has the @xmath7 projection @xmath8 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this hamiltonian ( see , e.g. , [ 7 ] ) are @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the number of interacting pairs on level @xmath3 , and @xmath12 is the seniority quantum number .    to construct the thermodynamics of spherical nuclei , we need a formula for the degree of degeneracy @xmath13 ( we shall drop the subscript @xmath3 in the rest of this section ) of the racah - mottelson energy levels ( 3 ) .",
    "the symmetry of the zero - seniority ground - state wave function ( see , e.g. , [ 8 ] ) is such that the wave function can be constructed from single - particle wave functions in only one way .",
    "hence the @xmath14 ground state is not degenerate : @xmath15 .",
    "one more quasiparticle can be added to the @xmath14 state in @xmath16 ways ( @xmath17 is the number of combinations of @xmath18 things taken @xmath19 at a time ) , and we thereby obtain an @xmath20 state , so that @xmath21 .",
    "two quasiparticles can be added to the @xmath14 state with @xmath22 quasiparticles in @xmath23 ways , but among them there is one that describes the ground state of @xmath24 quasiparticles , so that @xmath25 .",
    "arguing further in the same way we can prove the following general formula for the degree of degeneracy of the racah - mottelson energy levels by mathematical induction : @xmath26    for the case @xmath27 , @xmath28 , we can use stirling s formula @xmath29 to rewrite eq .",
    "( 4 ) in the form @xmath30.\\ ] ]    now let us find the number @xmath31 of states with seniority @xmath19 and angular momentum projection @xmath32 .",
    "it is clear that the sum of @xmath31 over all possible values of @xmath32 is @xmath13 . in order to find a way of evaluating @xmath31",
    "let us consider the matrix of hamiltonian ( 2 ) in more detail .",
    "the dimension of this matrix is the number @xmath33 of ways in which @xmath34 fermions can be distributed among @xmath18 cells .",
    "( it is easily seen that the sum of @xmath35 over all seniorities @xmath19 possible for the given @xmath34 is @xmath33 . )",
    "the hamiltonian matrix for the @xmath33 basis functions breaks up into blocks corresponding to different values of the quantum number @xmath19 .",
    "however , the block for the states with a given seniority breaks up in turn into still smaller blocks , since the hamiltonian conserves the angular momentum projection @xmath32 , so that different values correspond to different blocks .",
    "finally , the block for states with given fixed values of @xmath19 and @xmath32 also consists of smaller blocks , since different sets of unpaired particles can give rise to the same angular momentum projection @xmath32 .",
    "( here the term  pairing \" is used in a purely kinematic sense , namely , as an expression of the fact that two quasiparticles lie in cells corresponding to the same absolute value but opposite signs of the @xmath7 projection of the angular momentum . ) for definiteness let is consider the case of even @xmath19 ( and hence even @xmath34 ) .",
    "then the  smallest \" blocks in the matrix for hamiltonian ( 2 ) describe states in which there occur some number @xmath36 of unpaired quasiparticles giving a total angular momentum projection @xmath32 , and @xmath37 paired quasiparticles , which have @xmath38 and seniority @xmath39 .",
    "the number of such blocks is equal to the number @xmath40 of ways in which the angular momentum projection @xmath32 can be expressed as the sum of @xmath36 single - particle projections taken from the set @xmath41 ( no two single - particle projections equal in modulus but opposite in sign occurring in the sum ) , while the dimension of each block is equal to the degree of degeneracy @xmath42 of a state of paired quasiparticles that are distributed among @xmath43 free cells and have seniority @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the sum of the dimensions of all the blocks for states with angular momentum projection @xmath32 and seniority @xmath19 is @xmath44 a similar expression can also be written for odd @xmath19 .",
    "direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix for small values of @xmath45 and @xmath34 leads to values of @xmath46 that can be expressed by the formula @xmath47 by definition , @xmath46 is meaningful only for even @xmath19 .",
    "if we assume that formula ( 7 ) is valid for all even seniorities @xmath48 , we can prove that it is valid for seniority @xmath49 in much the same way as eq .",
    "( 4 ) was proved : hence it follows by mathematical induction that ( 7 ) is valid for all even seniorities @xmath50 .",
    "now let us seek the number @xmath51 of ways in which @xmath19 unpaired particles can give a total angular momentum projection of @xmath32 . since the formula for @xmath31 will be used later to describe macroscopic phenomena for which it is essential that @xmath52 , we can set @xmath53 ( also see [ 2 ] ) , so that the single - particle angular momentum projections are the elements of the set @xmath54 .",
    "now we shall construct a generating function for the unknown numbers @xmath55 . to do this we consider the sum @xmath56 taken over the values @xmath57 under the condition that @xmath58 the coefficient of @xmath59 in the sum ( 8) is @xmath60 . to take condition ( 10 ) into account , we make use of the identity @xmath61 in which the integration contour goes around the origin . if we multiply ( 11 ) by ( 8) , we can sum over all the values ( 9 ) independently , without regard for condition ( 10 ) . as a result",
    "we obtain the following expression for the generating function : @xmath62 if we make the substitution @xmath63 in ( 12 ) , the sum over @xmath32 becomes a finite fourier series . using the orthogonality relation @xmath64",
    "we obtain the following expression for the coefficients : @xmath65 now we expand the product of the expressions in parentheses in powers of @xmath66 and extend the integration over the entire real axis , obtaining : @xmath67\\exp\\left[-\\frac{3(z+2 ) }      { 4\\omega^3}m^2\\right].\\ ] ] this operation is legitimate since the integral over @xmath66 converges for @xmath68 and the characteristic values of @xmath7 ( see below ) are such that @xmath69 , so that @xmath70 .",

    "( 18 ) is that @xmath28 .    to calculate @xmath31",
    "it remains to substitute expressions ( 7 ) and ( 18 ) into ( 6 ) and perform the summation .",
    "approximating the right - hand side of ( 7 ) with the aid of stirling s formula and replacing the summation by integration , we obtain @xmath75\\exp(-3m^2/4k\\omega^2)dk}{k(\\omega - s/2-k)\\sqrt{(s/2-k)(\\omega - s/2-k)}},\\ ] ] where @xmath76 the function @xmath77 has a maximum at the point @xmath78 and at that point @xmath79 thus , if @xmath80 then @xmath77 will have a sharp maximum within the integration range , so we can replace the other slowly varying functions by their values at @xmath81 and integrate over @xmath82 from @xmath83 to @xmath84 . as a result we obtain the following final expression : @xmath85\\\\      & \\times \\exp[-3m^2/\\omega s(2\\omega - s ) ] .",

    "this factor can be found by calculating the moment of inertia of a normal fermi liquid by a method similar to that used above .",

    "we can only assert that condition ( 61 ) becomes more important , and may become dominant , for spherical nuclei that lie close as regards number of nucleons to the phase transformation point .",
    "the @xmath1-ray spectra and radiative widths of nuclei that are spherical in the ground state confirm this ( see [ 5,12 ] ) .",
    "we also note that all the equations we have derived relate the average values of the thermodynamic quantities to one another , i.e. , they are valid only when the fluctuations are small .",
    "however , the temperature fluctuations [ 10 ] @xmath170 amount to @xmath171  mev for @xmath172 , so that the thermodynamic formulas can only serve as rough estimates at the excitation energies now being investigated for spherical nuclei .",
