    "in both wireless and wireline communication systems , received signals are often corrupted by carrier - frequency offsets ( cfos ) , due to doppler shift and/or local oscillator drift .",
    "the cfo causes a time - varying rotation of the data symbols , and thus before symbol recovery , it must be estimated and accurately compensated for by the receiver .",
    "the cfo can be estimated via the use of pilots symbols ; however , even a small error in this estimation tends to cause large data recovery errors .",
    "this necessitates transmission of pilot symbols rather often . in single user systems , or in multiuser systems where the transmitters are physically connected to the same oscillator , there is only one cfo that needs to be estimated .",
    "this is typically done via a decision feedback phase lock loop ( pll ) at the receiver .",
    "the pll is a closed - loop feedback control system that can adaptively track both frequency and phase offsets between the equalized signals and the reference constellation .",
    "however , depending on the constellation used during transmission , the pll can have an @xmath0-fold symmetric ambiguity , and thus it has limited cfo acquisition range ; e.g. , @xmath1 for 4qam signals .",
    "moreover , the pll require a long convergence time . to solve these problems ,",
    "several methods have been proposed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite that allow for blind estimation of the cfo and symbols using the second - order cyclo - stationary statistics of the over - sampled received signal .",
    "blind cfo estimation has also been studied in the context of orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( ofdm ) systems , where the cfo destroys the orthogonality between the carriers ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .    in a spatially distributed multiuser antenna system",
    "where data are transmitted simultaneously from multiple antennas , the received signal contains multiple cfos , one for each transmit antenna .",
    "a pll does not work in this case as there is no single frequency to lock onto .",
    "the literature on estimation of multiple cfos is rather sparse . in @xcite ,",
    "multiple cfos were estimated by using pilot symbols that were uncorrelated among the different users . to account for multiple offsets",
    ", @xcite proposed that multiple nodes transmit the same copy of the data with an artificial delay at each node .",
    "the resulting system was modeled as a convolutive single - input / single - output ( siso ) system with time - varying system response caused by the multiple cfos . a minimum mean - square error ( mmse )",
    "decision feedback equalizer was used to track and equalize the channel and to recover the input data .",
    "training symbols were required in order to obtain a channel estimate , which was used to initialize the equalizer .    in this paper , a new approach to blind cfo estimation and symbol recovery",
    "is proposed .",
    "the received base - band signal is over - sampled , and its polyphase components are used to formulate a virtual mimo problem . by applying blind mimo system estimation techniques , the system response can be estimated , and decoupled versions of the user symbols can be recovered , each one of which contains a distinct cfo . by applying a pll ,",
    "the cfo can be mitigated and the transmitted symbols can be recovered .",
    "the estimated mimo system response provides information about the cfos that can be used to initialize the pll , speed up its convergence , and avoid ambiguities usually linked with plls .",
    "we consider a distributed antenna system , where @xmath2 users transmit simultaneously to a base station .",
    "narrow - band transmission is assumed here , where the channel between any user and the base station is frequency non - selective .",
    "in addition , quasi - static fading is assumed , i.e. , the channel gains remain fixed during the packet length .",
    "the continuous - time base - band received signal @xmath3 can be expressed as @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the effect of channel fading between the @xmath6th user and the base station and also phase offset ; @xmath7 is the delay associated with the path between the @xmath6th user and the base station ; @xmath8 is the frequency offset of the @xmath6th user and @xmath9 represents noise ; @xmath10 denotes the transmitted signal of user @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the @xmath14th symbol of user @xmath11 ; @xmath15 is the symbol period ; and @xmath16 is a pulse function with support @xmath17 $ ] .    our objective is to obtain an estimate of @xmath18^t$ ] in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a column permutation matrix and @xmath21 a constant diagonal matrix .",
    "these are considered to be trivial ambiguities , and are typical in any blind problem .",
    "the received signal @xmath3 is sampled at rate @xmath22 , where the over - sampling factor @xmath23 is an integer . in order to guarantee that all the users pulses overlap at the sampling times , the over - sampling period should satisfy : @xmath24 . or , in other words , the over - sampling factor @xmath25 is upper bounded by @xmath26",
    ".    let @xmath27 denote the sampling times .",
    "the over - sampled received signal can be expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the normalized frequency offset between the @xmath6th user and the base station , and the typical element of the virtual mimo channel matrix @xmath30 is given by @xmath31    define the following : @xmath32^t$ ] ; @xmath33 , a tall matrix of dimension @xmath34 ; @xmath35^t$ ] ; and @xmath36^t$ ] .",
    "then , ( [ over - sampled ] ) can be written in matrix form as @xmath37    we could use the training based method of @xcite to solve the mimo system ( [ over - sampled ] ) .",
    "that method assumes that the pilot symbols of different users are uncorrelated .",
    "the cfos are obtained by searching for the location of a peak in the cross - correlation between the discrete - time fourier transform ( dtft ) of a pilot sequence and that of the received signal .    in the following",
    "we show how to estimate cfos and recover the transmitted signals in a bind fashion , i.e. , without the need for pilot symbols .",
    "the advantage of a blind approach is bandwidth efficiency since no bandwidth is wasted transmitting pilot symbols .",
    "let us make the following assumptions .",
    "* @xmath38 for each @xmath39 , @xmath40 is a zero - mean gaussian stationary random processes with variance @xmath41 , and is independent of the channel inputs .",
    "* @xmath42 for each @xmath11 , the sequence @xmath43 is a zero mean with independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "elements having nonzero kurtosis ; i.e. , @xmath44\\ne 0.$ ] the sequences @xmath45 s are also mutually independent . *",
    "@xmath46 the over - sampling factor @xmath25 is no less than @xmath2 .    under assumption ( a2 ) , it is easy to verify that the rotated input signals @xmath47 are also zero mean and i.i.d with nonzero kurtosis . also , the @xmath48 s are mutually independent for different @xmath11 s .",
    "assumption ( a3 ) guarantees that the virtual mimo channel matrix @xmath49 in ( [ matrixform ] ) has full rank with probability one .",
    "if the delays of users are randomly distributed in the interval @xmath50 , then each row of the channel matrix can be viewed as having been drawn randomly from a continuous distribution so that the channel matrix has full rank with probability one .",
    "one can apply any blind source separation algorithm ( e.g. , @xcite,@xcite or @xcite ) to obtain    @xmath51    subsequently , using a least - squares equalizer we can obtain an estimate of the de - coupled signals @xmath52 , within permutation and scalar ambiguities as @xmath53 without loss of generality we can assume that the transmitted signal has unit power . then , on denoting by @xmath54 the @xmath6th diagonal element of @xmath55 , the @xmath56th separated input signal can be expressed as @xmath57    in order to recover the transmitted signals , we still need to mitigate the effect of cfo in each decoupled signal .",
    "this can be done via a pll . by using the decoupled signals as inputs , and the constellation used in transmission as a reference",
    ", the pll can effectively mitigate the cfo by minimizing the feedback error , which is calculated based on the distance of the recovered signal and the closest valid constellation point .",
    "however , depending on the constellation used in transmission , there is a four - fold symmetric ambiguity for mqam signals , or @xmath0-fold symmetric ambiguity for mpsk signals .",
    "for example , for 4qam signals , and an initial cfo value of @xmath58 , the effective tracking range for @xmath59 is @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , depending on the value of the cfo , the pll generally needs a long convergence time , during which the input signals are not correctly recovered .",
    "next we will show that by exploring the structure of the virtual channel matrix , we can obtain an estimate of the cfos , which can then be used to initialize the pll . by doing this",
    ", we can prevent the symmetric ambiguity problem and enlarge the effective tracking range of the pll from @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "also , the convergence time of the pll can be greatly reduced .    by taking the phase of the estimated channel matrix @xmath62",
    ", we obtain @xmath63 where @xmath64 , which accounts for both the phase of @xmath5 and the estimated phase ambiguity in ( [ decouple ] ) .    by applying linear fitting on the @xmath56th column of @xmath65",
    "we obtain the least squares estimate of @xmath66 as @xmath67 we can write @xmath68 where @xmath69 represents estimation error .    on noting that the de - coupled signals @xmath70 in ( [ decouple ] ) are shuffled in the same manner as the estimated cfos in ( [ estcfo1 ] ) , we can use the estimated cfos to compensate for the effects of cfo in the decoupled signals ( [ decouple ] ) and thereby obtain estimates of the input signals as @xmath71    due to errors in the channel estimates , we can only compensate for most , but not all , of the cfo effects in ( [ decouple ] ) and so we can write @xmath72 by subsequently applying a pll to @xmath73 , we can further mitigate the effects of the residual cfo @xmath74 . for 4qam signals ,",
    "as long as @xmath75 , the residual cfo can be effectively removed by the pll .",
    "the initial cfo estimator ( [ estcfo1 ] ) can prevent the symmetric ambiguity of the pll , and can also greatly reduce the convergence time of the pll . from ( [ estcfo ] ) , we can see that the cfo estimator will achieve full acquisition range for the normalized cfo .",
    "in this section , we verify the validity of the proposed method via simulations , under the following assumptions .",
    "the channel coefficients @xmath76 are zero - mean gaussian random variables .",
    "the waveform @xmath77 is a hamming window .",
    "the delays , @xmath7 , @xmath78 are uniformly distributed in the range @xmath50 .",
    "the input signals are 4qam signals .",
    "the blind source separation algorithm used here is the jade method , which was downloaded from http://www.tsi.enst.fr/cardoso/guidesepsou.html .",
    "first we show results for a two - user systems with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , with @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . in fig .",
    "[ received3 ] we show the polyphase outputs @xmath83 . due to the mixing and the cfos",
    "no obvious constellation is visible . in fig .",
    "[ decoupled3 ] , we show the de - coupled signals @xmath84 @xmath85 right after jade . although still rotated by the cfos , two signals @xmath86 @xmath85 are clearly separated . in fig .",
    "[ recovered3 ] , we show the recovered input signals @xmath87 @xmath85 , where we can see that after compensating for the effect of cfos the constellations are recovered .",
    "next we show estimation results averaged over @xmath88 independent channel runs , and @xmath89 monte - carlo runs for each channel . for each channel case , the coefficients @xmath90",
    "were generated randomly , and the continuous cfos where chosen randomly in the range @xmath91 .",
    "the delays , @xmath7 , @xmath92 where chosen uniformly in the range of @xmath50 .",
    "the transmitted signal was 4qam .    the performance of both the pilot - based method and the proposed method at different data lengths and with snr set to @xmath93db is shown in fig . [ cfomse1 ] .",
    "for the pilot - based method , each user transmits a pilot sequence of length @xmath94 , and the pilots are random sequences uncorrelated between different users .",
    "[ cfomse1 ] shows the mean - square error ( mse ) for the cfo estimate ( [ estcfo1 ] ) for different values of the over - sampling factor @xmath25 . the mse is calculated usings @xmath95 ^ 2 = \\frac{1}{k } \\sum_{k=1}^{k}[({\\hat f}_k - f_k)t_s]^2 $ ] .",
    "we can see that by increasing @xmath25 we can improve the estimation accuracy .",
    "[ ber1 ] shows the bit error rate ( ber ) for different values of @xmath25 . for both blind and training methods ,",
    "the ber is calculated based on the recovered signals after the pll . as expected",
    ", the ber performance also improves by increasing @xmath25 .",
    "the proposed method appears to work well even for short data length .",
    "next we show the performance of both methods at various noise levels .",

    "[ ber2 ] , we show the ber performance after the pll for both blind and training based methods .",
    "we see that the proposed blind method has almost the same performance as the training based method for snr values lower than 20db , while the training based method can achieve better ber performance for higher values of snr .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a novel blind approach for identification of a distributed multiuser antenna system with multiple cfos . by over - sampling of the received base - band signal",
    ", the miso problem is converted into a mimo one .",
    "blind mimo system estimation then yields the system response , and mimo input recovery yields the decoupled transmitted signals , each one containing a cfo . by exploring the structure of the mimo system response",
