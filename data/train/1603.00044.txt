    "considerable efforts have been devoted in the last decades for understanding thermo - statistical properties of long - range interacting systems , in particular , the astrophysical systems @xcite .    the motivation for this paper born from the reading of some recent contributions on the thermo - statistics of gravitational clustering phenomenon in cosmology @xcite .",
    "as expected , thermodynamic description provides a different view of this phenomenon beyond the standard picture obtained from observations and @xmath0-body cosmological simulations .",
    "many works available in the literature start from the consideration of conventional ensembles of statistical mechanics such as canonical or gran - canonical ensembles @xcite .",
    "these studies typically involve the calculation of partition function : @xmath1d^{n}\\mathbf{r}d^{n}\\mathbf{p}\\ ] ] associated with a self - gravitating system of @xmath0 non - relativistic particles with hamiltonian @xmath2 .",

    "finally , some conclusions and open problems are summarized in the fifth section .",
    "gravitational clustering is a sudden process of re - organization that leads to development of compact astrophysical structures with negative heat capacities .",
    "although this thermodynamic behavior is regarded as an anomaly from the conventional perspective of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics , its presence is more a rule rather than an exception in the framework of astrophysical systems .",
    "in fact , this behavior plays a fundamental role during their evolution .",
    "it explains , as example , how interior of stars become hotter while shrink under its own gravitational field , a process that enables the occurrence of nuclear fusion reactions among more heavy atomic nuclei along the stellar evolution .",
    "the ubiquitous character of negative heat capacities in astrophysics can be justified through simple arguments as the virial theorem @xcite , or even more elaborated astrophysical models such as antonov isothermal model @xcite and king models of star clusters @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the existence of negative heat capacities has been reported in many other physical scenarios @xcite and its physical relevance is now widely accepted .",
    "nevertheless , there still survive several misconceptions and open questions concerning to this notion .",
    "for example , there is a poorly knowledge in physical community about thermodynamical equilibrium conditions associated with negative heat capacities and their unexpected implications on conventional ideas of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics .",
    "eddington was ones of the first investigators to advertise that a star or a stars cluster expands and cool down by absorbing energy @xcite .",
    "his arguments were based on virial theorem of classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "decades later @xcite , lynden - bell and wood considered the concept of _ negative specific heat _ to explain gravothermal catastrophe of isothermal model of antonov @xcite . while astronomers enjoyed eddington incongruous conclusions , the notion of negative specific heat ( or negative heat capacity ) was received that time with skepticism by the statistical mechanics community @xcite . as already emphasized two years later by thirring @xcite , the known theorem of classical fluctuation theory @xcite : @xmath7 seems to suggest that heat capacity should be _",
    "nonnegative_. thirring himself explained this paradox through the _ inequivalence _ of canonical and microcanonical statistical ensembles .",
    "fluctuation relation ( [ can.fr ] ) can be straightforwardly obtained by combining the first derivatives of canonical partition function ( [ zz ] ) : @xmath8 where @xmath5 , with @xmath4 being environmental temperature ( the system is found in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath or a thermostat ) , and @xmath9 is boltzmann constant . however",
    ", a different perspective is obtained when one starts from microcanonical definition of temperature : @xmath10 accordingly , a closed system exhibits a negative heat capacity when the entropy @xmath11 is a _",
    "convex function _ on the energy .",
    "as extensively discussed by gross @xcite , this mathematical behavior arises in nonhomogeneous systems , such as the long - range interacting systems like the astrophysical ones , or finite systems with short - range interactions that undergo a phase coexistence phenomenon , etc .",
    "thermodynamically speaking , the heat capacity is a _",
    "response function_. if the system macroscopic state is determined by several control variables @xmath12 besides energy , the second order derivatives of entropy can be related to other response functions such as isothermal magnetic and electric susceptibilities , the isothermal compressibility , etc .",
    "consequently , the existence of negative values in the heat capacity is just a particular case of anomalous values in response functions , whose mathematical origin is also related to the existence of states where the entropy is a non - concave function .",
    "a general misunderstanding concerning to states with negative heat capacities is that the presence of this anomaly , by itself , implies thermodynamical instability of these states .",
    "although it could sound strange , _ thermodynamical stability of a given system is not an intrinsic property of the same one , but it crucially depends on the external conditions that were imposed to_. this simple idea has profound and unexpected implications .",
    "let us illustrate the same one for the particular case of systems with negative heat capacities .",
    "following the same arguments of thirring @xcite , let us consider the typical arrangement considered in statistical mechanics : a closed system composed of two finite systems a and b , which are put in thermal contact among them and isolated of any external influence . as usual",
    ", let us assume that the total energy @xmath13 and entropy @xmath14 of the closed system are _ additive quantities _ , @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    ". maximization of entropy @xmath14 at constant energy @xmath13 demands the stationary condition : @xmath17 as well as the _ stability condition _ : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are heat capacities of these systems .",
    "accordingly , systems a and b are found in thermal equilibrium if they exhibit the same temperature and their heat capacities satisfy one of the following stability conditions : ( i ) both systems exhibit positive heat capacities , or ( ii ) a system exhibits a negative heat capacity , e.g. : @xmath21 , and the other a positive heat capacity @xmath22 that satisfies the following inequality @xcite : @xmath23    according to the above result , a system with negative heat capacity is found in thermal equilibrium with other system ( a bath ) that exhibits a finite positive heat capacity .",
    "conversely , thermal equilibrium is not possible if that system is put in thermal contact with a gibbs thermostat ( a heat bath that exhibits an infinite heat capacity ) .",
    "this type of equilibrium situation is the one associated with canonical or gran - canonical ensembles , which are widely employed to perform thermodynamical description of extensive systems of everyday applications . precisely , these systems are under the influence of natural environment , whose heat capacity is regarded infinity for most of practical purposes",
    ". however , canonical or gran - canonical ensembles are unable to describes the existence of negative heat capacities .",
    "since this anomaly is a relevant feature of astrophysical systems , these ensembles can not provide an adequate treatment for them .",
    "in other words , thermo - statistical approaches of gravitational clustering that start from calculation of canonical partition function ( [ zz ] ) are inadequate because of their consideration _ unable the access to fundamental information concerning to thermodynamics of astrophysical systems_.       and @xmath24 , and the third system c a positive heat capacity @xmath25$].,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] +    an unexpected consequence of the above analysis concerns to the called _ zeroth law of thermodynamics _ @xcite .",
    "this rule talks about transitivity of thermodynamic equilibrium : if two systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third system then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other .",
    "although this _ law _ helps to define the experimental notion of temperature , its validity is restricted to conventional short - range extensive systems of everyday applications that exhibit nonnegative heat capacities ( see scheme of figure [ zeroth.eps ] ) . according to thirring stability conditions , two identical systems that were initially prepared in the same macroscopic state ,",
    "can not remain in thermal equilibrium with each other if this state exhibits a negative heat capacity .",
    "this violation of zeroth law of thermodynamics was recently discussed by ramrez - hernndez et al .",
    "curiously , these authors cited thirring s paper @xcite , but they did nt discuss the relevance of inequality ( [ thirring ] ) on explanation of this violation .      fluctuation relation ( [ can.fr ] ) does not mean that the heat capacity is nonnegative .",
    "its true meaning is that only those states with nonnegative heat capacities are _ stable _ under the external conditions associated with canonical ensemble .",
    "according to thirring stability criterium ( [ thirring ] ) , open systems with negative heat capacities can be studied using a _ generalized statistical ensemble _ that involves a thermal contact with a bath with finite positive heat capacity .",
    "this argument was considered by curilef and i to generalize canonical fluctuation relation ( [ can.fr ] ) as follows @xcite : @xmath26 which is now compatible with the existence of negative heat capacities @xmath27 . as usual",
    ", @xmath28 denotes the thermal fluctuation of a given quantity @xmath29 with statistical expectation value @xmath30 .",
    "the presence of the term @xmath31 accounts for the feedback perturbation of the environmental ( or the heat bath ) inverse temperature @xmath32 as consequence of the energy interchange with the system . conventional ensembles of equilibrium statistical mechanics ( e.g. : , canonical or gran - canonical ensembles ) disregard this type of influence of canonical ensemble @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , kittel claimed that the notion of temperature fluctuations is an _",
    "oxymoron_. certainly , temperature parameter of canonical ensemble does not admit thermal fluctuations , in the same way that this ensemble does not describe negative heat capacities .",
    "however , microcanonical definition of temperature @xmath34 does not undergo these limitations . ] . applying this fluctuation relation to a system a that is put in thermal contact with a system b ( environment ) ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath35 stability condition ( [ stab ] ) is now re - derived from positivity of right - hand side of equation ( [ fluct.deriv ] ) .",
    "relation ( [ fluct.deriv ] ) drops to canonical fluctuation relation ( [ can.fr ] ) in the limit @xmath36 , as well as the microcanonical result @xmath37 when @xmath38 .",
    "accordingly , fluctuation relation ( [ etfr ] ) is associated with a family of generalized statistical ensembles that contains microcanonical and canonical ones as particular cases .",
    "notice that these generalized ensembles can be implemented in a physical laboratory with a great accuracy .",
    "classical fluctuation theory that is discussed in most of textbooks of equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite , is a formulation with a restricted applicability .",
    "most of theorems such as the canonical fluctuation relation ( [ can.fr ] ) between the heat capacity @xmath39 and the energy @xmath40 , and other known results as the fluctuation relation : @xmath41 between the isothermal magnetic susceptibility @xmath42 and the total magnetization @xmath43 , provide a wrong treatment to the existence of anomalous values in response functions .",
    "derivation of these theorems invokes approximations like _ gaussian approximation _ , or alternatively , some special system - surrounding equilibrium situations as the ones associated with canonical or gran canonical ensembles , where the thermodynamic parameters of the surrounding ( such its temperature @xmath4 , pressure @xmath44 , magnetic field @xmath45 , chemical potential @xmath46 , etc . ) are regarded as _ unperturbed quantities _ regardless the interaction with the system under consideration . however",
    ", a different perspective is revealed when one avoids the use of these arguments .",
    "for example , fluctuation relation ( [ fluct.deriv ] ) was pioneering derived by challa and hetherington in the framework of montecarlo simulations based on the gaussian ensemble @xcite : @xmath47 \\label{gens}\\ ] ] with parameter @xmath48 , which describes intermediate equilibrium situations between thermal contact with a gibbs thermostat ( canonical ensemble ) when @xmath49 and energy isolation ( microcanonical ensemble ) when @xmath50 .",
    "the form ( [ etfr ] ) is slightly more general , and yet , this is just a particular case of more general fluctuation theorems compatible with anomalous values in response functions . as already shown by curilef and i , these theorems appear as first - order approximations of the following _ exact fluctuation theorem _",
    "@xcite : @xmath51 which represents a fluctuation form of _ le chatelier - brown principle _",
    "@xcite : _ any change in status quo prompts an opposing reaction in the responding system_. here , @xmath52 are the _",

    "formally , this is a _ thermo - statistical analogous _ of heisenberg uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics @xcite , whose existence was postulated by bohr in the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite . by itself",
    ", this result suggests an interesting analogy between statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics @xcite , and therefore , an analogy between thermodynamics and classical mechanics .",
    "a direct consequence of the above exact results is that the external conditions modify the thermodynamic stability and fluctuating behavior of a given system . by itself",
    ", this simple conclusion challenges the conventional understanding of phase transitions and critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "for example , the exact solution of 2d ising model predicts a divergence of the heat capacity at the critical point @xcite . according to canonical fluctuation relation ( [ can.fr ] ) ,",
    "such a divergence implies the divergence of thermal fluctuations of energy .",
    "however , thermal fluctuations of energy described by equation ( [ fluct.deriv ] ) now depend on the presence of bath with finite heat capacity @xmath20 .",
    "this generalized fluctuation relation predicts that energy fluctuations remain finite regardless the divergence of system heat capacity @xmath59 .",
    "this means that divergence of thermal fluctuations observed at the critical point , and other critical phenomena ( e.g. : spontaneous breaking of symmetry , critical opalescence , long - range order , etc . ) , are not intrinsic properties for a given system because of their occurrence also depends on the external conditions .     with periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath60 is the energy per site ) .",

    ", the development of non - homogeneities , such as phase separations in fluids or formation of magnetic domains , will be also observed in this case , but all those effects associated with instability of negative heat capacities within canonical ensemble will disappear , such as bimodality of energy distributions , large thermal fluctuations , long - range statistical correlations , etc .",

    "the advantage is that several difficulties associated with occurrence of phase transitions can be avoided with a _ fine - tuning _ of external conditions .",
    "the present ideas have important implications in understanding the thermodynamics of astrophysical systems .",
    "as expected , the thermodynamic stability ( or instability ) of a given astrophysical system is not an intrinsic property of the same one since it depends on the external influence of other astrophysical systems .",
    "surprisingly , such a dependence on the external conditions is not restricted to its fluctuating behavior and thermodynamic stability : _ every thermodynamic behavior _ of the astrophysical system is considerably affected by any external perturbation because of the _ long - range character _ of gravitation .",
    "this peculiarity is one of the reasons that explains why thermodynamics of astrophysical systems is so radically different from that of extensive systems of everyday practice .",
    "to my knowledge , the pioneering evidence about the relevance of negative heat capacities in astrophysics was provided by eddington @xcite .",
    "he considered the virial theorem : @xmath71 for a 3d system of non - relativistic point particles whose interacting forces exhibit a radial dependence @xmath72 .",

    "therefore , the expectation values of the total kinetic and potential energies are related as @xmath75 , while the total energy @xmath76 . assuming the equipartition relation between kinetic energy and temperature @xmath77 , one obtains the following estimation for heat capacity : @xmath78",
    "although the virial theorem ( [ virial ] ) provides a simplest argument that the heat capacity of astrophysical systems could be negative , the general applicability of this analysis can not be over - estimated .",
    "for example , the heat capacity can be positive when an astrophysical system is confined under an external potential well @xmath79 .",
    "on the other hand , the equipartition relation @xmath77 does not hold if the astrophysical system suffers from the evaporation of its constituents .",

    "specifically , this model considers a self - gravitating gas of identical non - relativistic classical point particles : @xmath96 that is enclosed inside a _ container with a impenetrable wall _ : @xmath97 since this external field exhibits an infinite potential barrier , it fully suppresses the evaporation of system constituents .",

    "however , the present thermo - statistical arguments describe an additional and nontrivial consequence of evaporation : a nonuniform redistribution of particles that arises as a long - range effect of gravitation .",

    "it is possible to verify that thermodynamical behavior of antonov isothermal model depends both on the container shape and its linear dimensions @xcite .",

    "such a _ sensibility _ to the external influence is observed during the occurrence of a critical phenomenon because of the divergence of correlation length @xmath226 @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , systems with long - range interactions , as the astrophysical ones , behave as _ they permanently were in a critical state _ , although with a less dramatic character .",
    "for example , the statistical correlations among particles in conventional extensive systems follow an exponential behavior as @xmath227 $ ] , where the correlation length @xmath226 is comparable to the system linear size near critical point @xcite . for the case of astrophysical systems ,",
    "the two - point correlations are replaced by a power - law dependence as @xmath228 , although one should observe a stronger dependence during the occurrence of gravitational collapse .",
    "some studies in the past revealed that the large - scale distribution of galaxies in the universe seems to follow this type of power - law with exponent @xmath229.@xmath230 @xcite , and presumably , other more complex behaviors are relevant in different length scales @xcite .    the ubiquitous existence of long - range correlations in astrophysical situations is a direct consequence of the long - range character of gravitation .",
    "of course , some macroscopic behaviors can be related to the fact that newtonian gravitation @xmath231 is intrinsically _ scale - free interaction_. a purely classical self - gravitating gas of non - relativistic point particles interacting via newtonian gravitation , as the one described by hamiltonian ( [ sgg ] ) with external potential @xmath232 , has no characteristic energy or linear dimension .",
    "in fact , the characteristic lengths and energies for most of astrophysical models reviewed in this work are determined by the external conditions .",
    "a remarkable exception here is the plummer model , where the characteristic linear dimension of particles distribution ( [ plummer.length ] ) is determined from its own total energy @xmath40 and mass @xmath43 .",
    "this astrophysical model exhibits what it could be regarded as a _ scale - free thermodynamic behavior_. the absence of characteristic lengths is the reason why this model can not describe collective behaviors like gravitational collapse or evaporation disruption .      lynden - bell and wood @xcite employed the notion of negative heat capacity to explain gravothermal collapse of antonov isothermal model @xcite .",
    "their arguments were based on the application of stability condition ( [ thirring ] ) considering the positive heat capacity of _ outer regions _ of the system and the negative heat capacity of its _ _ inner ones _ _ ) two years after publication lynden - bell and wood , these last authors were aware about its existence . according to their own words : _ ... if the outer parts have a specific heat smaller than the magnitude of the negative specific heat of the inner parts , then the outer temperature will increase faster than the inner one .",
    "it will therefore catch up and a possible equilibrium state will be achieved . if however the outer parts are too extensive their specific heat will be large .",
    "conductive transfer of heat from the central parts will then raise the high central temperature faster than it raises the lower temperature of the outer parts .",
    "this is what we call the * gravothermal catastrophe * ... _ ] .",
    "although their reasonings were quite convincing , a re - examination of this situation clarifies that this stability criterion can not be naively applied here .",
    "the derivation of thirring inequality ( [ thirring ] ) involves two strong conditions : ( i ) the _ separability _ of a closed system into two independent subsystems , and ( ii ) the _ additivity _ of the total energy due to the existence of a thermal contact .",
    "none of these conditions is met for the astrophysical situation considered by these authors .    a single astrophysical structure ( e.g. : a star or a stars cluster ) can not trivially divided into subsystems in a way that its total entropy could be expressed as sum of respective entropies of these subsystems .",
    "gravitation is a long - range force , and hence , the constituents a given astrophysical structure are strongly correlated among them .",
    "in fact , it is _ impossible to modify a part of the same one without affecting the whole astrophysical structure_. this very fact is evidenced in each astrophysical model previously considered , including the proper antonov isothermal model .",
    "however , the additivity of the total entropy arises as a good approximation when a closed system is already divided into a very small number of astrophysical structures .",
    ", e.g. : a binary star system , a star cluster and its host galaxy , etc .",
    "such an effective separability is implemented in terms of _ internal _ and _ collective degrees of freedom_.    the separability of a given closed system into subsystems is a pre - requisite for the existence of _ additivity _ for a given physical quantity .",
    "however , the separability itself does not guarantee the additivity .",
    "the additivity of the energy under the _ thermal contact _ represents a good approximation in the framework of large extensive systems of everyday applications since they are driven by _ short - range interactions_. the constituents of each system that are affected by the presence of the other one are mostly located near their surfaces , so that , the total interaction energy associated to thermal contact can be regarded as a _ surface effect _ , which is negligible in comparison to the bulk internal energies of each system . in contrast , the interaction among astrophysical systems involve all their constituting particles because of gravitation is a long - range interaction .",
    "the associated interaction energy among astrophysical systems represent _ bulk effects _ , so that , the additivity of the total energy does not hold in general .",
    "a better understanding about how separability and additivity are extended to astrophysical situations will be analyzed in the subsection [ gen.stat.cond ] .    to avoid any misunderstanding of potential readers , it is important to remark",
    "that gravitational collapse is a type of thermodynamic instability that is present for most of astrophysical systems in any scale .",
    "what is wrong here is the explanation of this phenomenon in terms of separability of a given astrophysical system into independent subsystems .",
    "gravitational collapse is related to presence of negative heat capacities since both behaviors arise as direct consequences of radial dependence @xmath233 of gravitational interaction ( the called short - range divergence ) .",
    "however , one can advertise an additional relationship analyzing the energy dependence of specific heat @xmath92 shown in inset panel of figure [ antonov.eps ] .",
    "the critical energy of gravitational collapse @xmath108 also coincides with the _ eventual vanishing of the heat capacity_. once again , this mathematical behavior may suggests a misleading impression that heat capacity becomes zero as if the system would be decomposed of separable outer and inner parts with the appropriate heat capacity",
    ". however , this behavior is more analogue to the vanishing of heat capacity of quantum gases in the zeroth temperature limit , where their internal degrees of freedom ( e.g. : translational , vibrational and rotational ) are _ effectively frozen_. the astrophysical case is different since the temperature grows when the system approaches the point of gravitational collapse .",
    "the system as a whole undergoes at this critical point a collective fall under its own gravitational field , which leads to a sudden formation of a _ core - halo structure _ and the transformation of potential energy into kinetic . this _ collective process of self - organization _",
    "is necessarily accompanied with a growth of the statistical correlations among the particles .",
    "the number degrees of freedom is effectively reduced here because of they lose their statistical independence , which would explain the sudden reduction of heat capacity per particles .    from a thermo - statistical viewpoint , the gravitational collapse can be related to a new type of collective phenomena : the called _ discontinuous microcanonical phase transitions _ @xcite .",
    "this phase transition involves an exotic type of _ ergodicity breaking _",
    "@xcite , where the system is dynamically trapped in one among two or more different stable configurations that exhibit the same value of energy ( stable configurations with different internal conditions for temperature , central density , pressure , etc . ) .",
    "antonov isothermal model does not show this type of phase transitions since it disregards the _ underlying physics _ in the post - collapse phase . as already discussed in the literature @xcite , the system can find a new branch of stable configurations after gravothermal collapse if the _ quantum behavior _ of particles is taken into account , or even , when the particles exhibit an internal structure like a small _ hard - core _ or _ soft - core _ radius .",
    "thermo - statistics of astrophysical systems is hallmarked by the occurrence of gravitational collapse at low energies and the existence of states with negative heat capacities . among conventional ensembles of equilibrium statistical mechanics ,",
    "the microcanonical ensemble is the only able to describe these macroscopic behaviors .",
    "this statistical ensemble , however , presupposes that the system of interest is put into energetic isolation , which is a situation that does not correspond to actual conditions of astrophysical systems in nature .",
    "most of real astrophysical systems belong to the class of _ open systems _",
    ", that is , systems that are able to interchange energy and matter with other astrophysical systems ( e.g. : stars are part of multiple stars systems ; stars clusters are under gravitational influence of their host galaxy ; galaxies themselves undergo the gravitational influence of other galaxies in a galactic cluster , etc . ) .",
    "usually , open systems in equilibrium are described within canonical or gran canonical ensembles .",
    "although these statistical ensembles are employed in the literature to analyze astrophysical problems , their consideration is merely a theoretical exercise without practical support .",
    "how does one justify the existence of a _ thermal contact _ between an astrophysical system and a gibbs thermostat ?",
    "besides , what physical system meets the necessary requirements to be considered as a good approximation of a gibbs thermostat in the astrophysical scenario ? from a purely theoretical perspective , one can enclose the system inside a container whose walls are kept at constant temperature @xcite , or immerse the astrophysical system into an infinite medium with constant temperature @xcite , among others .",
    "however , all these arguments are based on our practical experience with short - range extensive systems , which is irrelevant to deal with astrophysical problems .",
    "astrophysical systems in nature interact with other astrophysical systems only , which are necessarily coupled among them throughout gravitation .",
    "clearly , these situations do not correspond to the ones considered by conventional statistical ensembles .",
    "the challenge here is the derivation of more suitable statistical ensembles , as example , astrophysical counterparts of canonical and gran canonical ensembles .",
    "why is this subject so important ?",
    "as already emphasized in section [ nhc ] , the thermodynamic behavior of a given macroscopic system actually depends on the external conditions that were impose to .",
    "this situation is known in the literature as _ inequivalence of ensembles _",
    "@xcite . however , the importance of this phenomenon in astrophysical problems is more significant .",
    "the long - range character of gravitation enables that any change in the external conditions will modify the _ system bulk properties _ , such as the equations of state , the response functions , and even , the occurrence of phase transitions .",
    "accordingly , a realistic description of each open astrophysical system requires a full specification of its associated external conditions .",
    "the possible generalization of conventional statistical ensembles for astrophysical scenario requires to face the following question : can two or more astrophysical systems in mutual interaction , each one with a negative heat capacity , remain in equilibrium ( or at least , in a quasi - stationary situation ) ? according to thirring stability conditions ( see in subsection [ thirring ] ) , two systems with negative heat capacities can not remain in equilibrium .",
    "however , a negative answer to the previous question could be in contradiction with astrophysical observations .",
    "most of stars in universe are part of multiple star systems , binary stars as example @xcite . strictly speaking ,",
    "stars are thermodynamic systems with negative heat capacities that are fully able to interchange energy by mean of their gravitational interaction , as example , they undergo heating by tidal interactions @xcite .",
    "if one star gains energy from its companion in a binary system , its temperature decreases while the companion temperature increases , a situation that in some way should speed - up the rate of energy transference .",
    "such a process will unavoidably lead to the gravitational collapse of the star that looses energy and the evaporative disruption of its companion . in principle , this picture could be a regarded as a licit description of final stage of evolution of these systems , but binary stars should remain stable the major part of their life . notice that the stability analysis of these systems concerns both the dynamic stability and the processes of mass transference @xcite .",
    "typically , it is regarded that these stellar systems evolve as _ independent thermodynamic systems _ , which is obviously a simplifying consideration .",
    "this situation could be explained by two reasons : ( i ) the rate of energy transference between the stars in a binary system is extremely low , or ( ii ) there is something _",
    "wrong _ with application of thirring stability conditions in astrophysical situations .",
    "this paradox situation is partially solved from the fact that the starting considerations of thirring stability criteria ( [ thirring ] ) do not apply for the case of astrophysical systems .",
    "two separable astrophysical systems in mutual interaction could support an additive total entropy , @xmath234 .",
    "however , their total energy @xmath13 can not be expressed as the sum of their respective internal energies as @xmath235 because of the long - range character of gravitation .",
    "i think that thermodynamic stability could be possible under certain conditions , but it is necessary to perform a re - examination of thirring stability analysis for astrophysical situations .",
    "before to enter to analyze the conditions of thermodynamic stability , let us discuss about the relevance of _ thermodynamic equilibrium _ for real astrophysical systems . as discussed elsewhere , this is a suitable idealization that is assumed to face the study of conventional systems of everyday applications of thermodynamics .",
    "its existence is postulated in order to introduce the temperature notion , which is keystone that supports other notions , methods and laws of thermodynamics .",
    "conceptually , the existence of thermodynamic equilibrium plays a similar role of the _ law of inertia _ in classical mechanics .",
    "the later one is employed as a pre - requisite to introduce the notion of _ force _ as a quantitative measure of interactions , while temperature differences ( or gradients ) behave as _ generalized thermodynamic forces _ that drive the fluxes of energy and heat among the macroscopic systems . in an analogous way that a real system can not fully be isolated from the incidence of external forces",
    ", the systems in nature can not be found in a rigorous thermodynamic equilibrium . at most",
    ", they exhibit a _ quasi - stationary evolution _ under certain background conditions , where the rate of change of their macroscopic observables is sufficiently slow during the lapse time of interest . for practical purposes ,",
    "such a very slow evolution of macroscopic behavior is sufficient to speak about a sort of _ quasi - equilibrium_. our practical experience evidences that methods of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics can be applied to predict the macroscopic properties of systems in quasi - stationary conditions .    at first glance , the study of real astrophysical systems present serious difficulties .",
    "not only their thermodynamic properties are different , but the external background conditions that operate in a given astrophysical situation are _ non - controllable_. this very fact contrasts with the case of conventional extensive systems that are studied in our laboratories .",
    "the usage of idealizations such as containers with impenetrable walls or non - conducting boundaries is highly nonphysical in the astrophysical scenario .",
    "consequently , the incidence of evaporation and the energy dissipation will always play a significant role here .",
    "does this mean that we should renounce the use of all these thermodynamic idealizations in the case of astrophysical systems ?",
    "on the contrary , concepts and methods of thermodynamics should be adapted to this physical scenario .",
    "in particular , the notion of thermodynamic equilibrium should be replaced by a quasi - equilibrium , which is also relevant to study traditional systems of everyday practice .",
    "is the notion of quasi - equilibrium relevant for real astrophysical systems ?",
    "judge yourself .",
    "stars are open astrophysical systems that continuously release energy and matter to the space .",
    "however , they reach a quasi - stationary evolution with predictable regularities .",
    "the best example of these regularities is the temperature - luminosity ( or color - magnitude ) relation represented by the known hertzsprung - russell diagrams @xcite , as the one shown figure [ hr.eps ] .",
    "moreover , the effective surface temperature of stars and the spectrum of solar radiation can also described with a good accuracy by the laws of black - body thermal radiation .",
    "other example is the case of globular clusters , whose distribution profiles and evolution can be explained with the help of simple statistical models , like king models reviewed in this work @xcite .",
    "galaxies them - selves suffer from gravitational interaction of other galaxies , and they presupposed evolve without the incidence of collisions .",
    "surprisingly , the brightness profiles of galaxies exhibit simple regularities such as vaucouleurs and sersic profiles @xcite , while their associated dark matter haloes also follow other predictable regularities @xcite .",

    "however , the characteristic linear size of the system @xmath482 is duplicated .",
    "it means that the merge leads to a reconfiguration of particles distribution .",
    "hence , the growth of the entropy is related to the fact that the system final volume @xmath483 is four times the initial volume @xmath484 .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of non - extensive character of astrophysical systems .",
    "let us now consider the second situation : the merge of two identical open astrophysical systems ( e.g. : two globular clusters ) that are under the gravitational influence of a third very large astrophysical system ( e.g. : their host galaxy ) .",
    "formally , each system of this situation could be described by king model discussed in subsection [ king.section ] .",
    "let us suppose that these systems evolve in opposite directions along a same circular orbit of around a galaxy with a very large mass @xmath485 .",

    "precisely , the internal energy of these systems is of order @xmath487 , while the interaction energy @xmath488 , where @xmath489 ( tidal radius of equation ( [ tidal.quad ] ) above ) . since @xmath490 .",

    "interestingly , the present situation should also obey an additional restriction : the final configuration of the compound system could be stable if its dimensionless energy @xmath504 is lower than the critical energy of the _ evaporative disruption _ @xmath87.@xmath505 .",

    "separability and additivity under a thermal contact is not longer a licit idealization to study astrophysical systems in mutual thermodynamic interaction .",
    "however , restricted forms of these properties are still possible when there exists an effective separability among the collective and the internal degrees of freedom of these systems .",
    "the collective motions are now responsible to drive the interaction among the astrophysical systems .",
    "this mechanism replaces the conventional thermal contact and introduces significant modifications in thermal equilibrium conditions [ including the stationary conditions ( equalization of temperatures ) and stability conditions ( restrictions over response functions ) ] and the energy transport .",
    "a plausible consequence of this mechanism is that thermal equilibrium could be possible among astrophysical systems with negative heat capacities .",
    "moreover , distribution profiles with very dense cores , which are associated with states with negative heat capacities , favor the stability of collective motions of two interacting astrophysical systems .",
    "thermodynamic behavior of astrophysical systems exhibits a strong dependence on the external backgrounds conditions .",
    "the incidence of a long - range interaction as gravitation imposes that all constituents are strongly correlated among them . in this way , any external influence , even acting on the system boundary , will propagates to the whole astrophysical structure and modifies its macroscopic behavior in a radical way . by itself",
    ", this is why the thermodynamics of astrophysical systems is so rich and challenging . qualitatively speaking , astrophysical systems exhibit general features such as negative heat capacities and gravitational collapse .",
    "however , the concrete quantitative characterization of these macroscopic phenomena depends on the external conditions that affect each astrophysical situation .",
    "although a universal thermodynamic limit for astrophysical systems is not possible , some analogous scaling relations are possible for certain situations . in particular",
    ", the scaling laws ( [ non.extensive.th ] ) can be regarded as the right thermodynamic limit for a three - dimensional self - gravitating gas of identical non - relativistic point particles regardless their classical or quantum nature .",

    "these scaling laws are restricted by the incidence of relativistic effects . according to the arguments presented during comparison with other thermodynamic limits ,",
    "extensivity of entropy seems to be a more general property than any other criterium to establish a scaling behavior for macroscopic observables ( e.g. : the called kac prescription @xcite ) .",
    "conceptually , this idea is quite satisfactory because of the entropy is the central notion of thermo - statistical description .",
    "several analysis presented in this work are far to be complete",
    ". a deeper study of these questions should lead to the new theoretical developments such as the astrophysical counterparts of conventional canonical and gran canonical statistical ensembles , as well as a better understanding of phase transitions and critical phenomena in astrophysics .",
