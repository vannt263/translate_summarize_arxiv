    "in a compton scattering experiment one measures the so - called compton profile ( cp ) , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the ground state electron momentum density . in an independent particle model the momentum density is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the electron wave function.@xcite the summation in eq .",
    "( [ equ:02 ] ) extends over all occupied states . the compton profile , @xmath4 , thus contains signatures of the fermi surface breaks and correlation effects in the underlying three dimensional momentum distribution @xmath1 . since fermi momenta @xmath5 are typically @xmath6 1 a.u .",
    ", a high momentum resolution of @xmath60.1 a.u . is essential in the experiment for delineating fermi surface related fine structure in the cp .",
    "high - resolution compton studies have recently been reported on li,@xcite be,@xcite v,@xcite and cu.@xcite in all these cases , careful comparisons of the shapes of the absolute valence electron cp s , and the structure in the first and second derivatives as well as the directional anisotropies of the cp s , have been made with the corresponding parameter - free theoretical predictions based on the use of the lda .",
    "a similar investigation of li - rich limg disordered alloys where disorder effects were treated using the mean field kkr - cpa approach has also been carried out.@xcite in this way , the band - theory based lda approach has been shown to provide a remarkably accurate description of many aspects of the momentum density associated with the quantum mechanical electronic ground state , including the characteristic fine structure induced by the fermi surface .",
    "more exciting however is the fact that the aforementioned comparisons have for the first time clearly established the presence of systematic deviations between theoretical and experimental momentum densities . in li , the experimental break",
    "@xmath7 in the momentum density at @xmath5 appears to be very small , nearly zero@xcite ; if so , this is very far from the results of electron gas calculations stretching over the last several decades.@xcite in be , the latest compton data@xcite indicates _",
    "electron correlation effects outside the scope of much of the existing theoretical work which is based on treating properties of the homogeneous electron gas.@xcite for these reasons , a renewed interest in the problem of correlation effects on the momentum density beyond the lda is natural,@xcite although much further work is necessary for developing an approach of wide applicability in metals and alloys .",
    "bearing these considerations in mind , there is strong motivation for undertaking high - resolution compton studies of other systems .",
    "our choice of al in this connection is an especially good one because al is trivalent and , therefore , it extends the range of electron densities investigated so far via high - resolution compton .",
    "correlation effects are of course expected to become less important with increasing electron density as the kinetic energy dominates .",
    "also , al has been the traditional touchstone of a free - electron - like metal with a nearly spherical fermi surface ( viewed in the extended zone ) . neither a high - resolution , high - statistics compton measurement , nor a band theory computation of high accuracy in order to identify fermi surface related fine structure in the cp s of al is currently available in the literature.@xcite the goal of the present work is to fill this gap and determine the extent to which the lda describes the momentum density in al .",
    "the existing compton data on al consists essentially of a number of measured cp s using @xmath8-ray sources and solid state detectors at low momentum resolution.@xcite quite some time ago , shiotani _",
    "et al._@xcite obtained the [ 111 ] cp of al at a momentum resolution of 0.08 au , but did not investigate the anisotropy of the cp or the fermi surface signatures therein .",
    "an outline of this article is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the experimental procedures .",
    "section iii gives pertinent details of computations .",
    "in section iv the experimental cp s are analyzed in the light of the band theory predictions as well as a number of other model computations .",
    "the compton results are also compared briefly with closely related positron annihilation spectra .",
    "section v summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "single crystals of al with surface normals oriented along the [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] directions were used .",
    "the thickness of the crystals was about 2 mm .",
    "the reader is referred to sakurai _",
    "et al._@xcite for details of our compton spectrometer , and to tanaka _",
    "et al._@xcite and itou _",
    "et al._@xcite for our data processing procedures .",
    "briefly , the spectrometer consists of a cauchois - type bent - crystal analyzer of si(422 ) with an image plate serving as a position sensitive detector .",
    "the scattering angle is @xmath9 . the synchrotron radiation x - rays from a multipole wiggler installed in the 6.5 gev accumulation ring at the national laboratory for high energy physics are monochromatized by a quasi - doubly bent monochromator to 59.38 kev with an energy resolution of about 80 ev .",
    "the overall momentum resolution is estimated to be 0.12 a.u .",
    "the double compton scattering events were simulated via the monte carlo program of sakai@xcite ; the integrated intensity of the double scattering events was found to be 10% of the single scattering events .",
    "the statistical error of each datum point , given by @xmath10 , is estimated to be less than 0.3 % .",
    "since the data points are not measured equidistantly they are interpolated onto an equidistant mesh of 0.02 a.u . using simple linear interpolation .",
    "the data were numerically differentiated according to @xmath11/[x(i+1)-x(i ) ] +   [ y(i)-y(i-1)]/[x(i)-x(i-1)]\\rbrace$ ] .",
    "no further smoothing or filtering was applied .",
    "the interpolation and differentiation cause some statistical correlation between the data points .",
    "the band structure problem was solved within the all - electron charge self - consistent kkr framework without any free parameter .",
    "exchange - correlation effects were incorporated using the von barth - hedin local spin density ( lsd ) approximation.@xcite the lattice constant was computed to be 7.6534 a.u . by minimizing the total energy ; for comparison , the experimental lattice constant at room temperature is 7.6559 a.u .",
    "the self - consistent crystal potential was obtained by iterating the kkr cycles using an elliptic contour with 48 points in the complex energy plane .",
    "the final charge density is self - consistent to an accuracy of about @xmath12 electrons and the fermi energy to @xmath12 ry .",
    "an angular momentum cutoff @xmath13 was employed .",
    "a free - electron - like fermi surface was found with fermi radii @xmath14 and @xmath15 a.u . ; the free - electron value would be 0.9254 a.u .",
    "the cp s were obtained by first evaluating the three - dimensional momentum density @xmath1 in terms of the momentum matrix element of the kkr green s function@xcite over a fine mesh of @xmath16 * p*-points , covering momenta up to @xmath17 a.u .",
    "this mesh involves 4851 * k*-points in the 1/48-th irreducible part of the brillouin zone with each * k*-point translated into 177 * p*-points by adding reciprocal lattice vectors ; the factor of 48 takes into account the symmetry operations of the cubic point group .",
    "the cp s can then be computed accurately by evaluating the two - dimensional integral of eq .",
    "( [ equ:01 ] ) using a generalized linear tetrahedron method.@xcite the final cp s have been calculated over a momentum mesh containing 151 @xmath18 points in the range 0 - 3 a.u . along each of the three measured directions .",
    "the accuracy of the computed profiles is about 1 part in @xmath19 .",
    "a similar integration technique has been used in our earlier studies of high - resolution cp s of various metals and alloys.@xcite .",
    "the lam - platzman correction@xcite to the cp s was computed using the occupation number density of the uniform electron gas .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the measured and computed cp s of the valence electrons along the [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] directions ; the theoretical cp s are convoluted with a gaussian which represents the experimental resolution of 0.12 a.u .",
    "the experimental valence cp s have been obtained by subtracting the theoretical core cp s from the measured profiles . in this connection , we used the solid - state core wavefunctions which reflect the slight overlap of the @xmath20 core states in al .",
    "the first and second derivatives of the valence profiles have been obtained by numerical differentiation .    in examining the overall shape of the cp s in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , one notes that the experimental points are lower at low momenta compared to the calculated values .",
    "we emphasize that this does not imply that the measured 3d momentum density is lower than the theoretical one at all momenta . to see this , recall that@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the directionally averaged cp which in a cubic crystal may be reasonably approximated by@xcite @xmath23 . \\label{equ:04}\\ ] ] the bottom row in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the differences between the experimental and theoretical second derivatives at @xmath24 are well within the error bars . in view of eq .",
    "( [ equ:03 ] ) , this indicates that the underlying 3d distributions are not significantly different at @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , this result implies that the measured momentum density must be smaller than the theoretical one at momenta approaching the fermi momentum @xmath5 .",
    "this is also borne out by the first derivatives shown in the central row of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] which begin to show differences between experiment and theory only above @xmath25 a.u .",
    "further insight is provided by fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] which shows the spherically averaged 3d momentum density defined by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is obtained via eq .",
    "( [ equ:04 ] ) .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath28 at small momenta reflect partly the large ( correlated ) error bars due to the division of the small derivative by small values of @xmath29 , and partly the ( spherically averaged ) effect of brillouin zone - face interactions to be discussed below . in any event , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] makes it clear that the experimental 3d momentum density lies below the theoretical predictions as one approaches @xmath5 , and that the situation reverses itself above @xmath5 .",
    "the 2nd derivatives @xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] all show a peak at @xmath5 .",
    "there is good agreement between theory and experiment as to the position of the peaks , _ i.e. _ , the value of @xmath5 , but the measured peaks are all lower and broader than the theoretical predictions . although the shapes of the @xmath30 peaks reflect the complex interplay between the effects of experimental resolution , electron correlations and lattice potential on the fermi cut - off in the momentum density , it is evident from figs . [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] that the measured distribution possesses a tail higher than the theory beyond @xmath5 .",
    "these discrepancies between theory and experiment are similar to those reported earlier in li@xcite and other metals@xcite and have their origin in the electron correlation effects beyond the lda which are not treated properly within our theoretical framework .",
    "such correlations are expected to cause ( relative to the independent particle model ) a decrease of the momentum density as one approaches @xmath5 , and a tail at momenta greater than @xmath5 ; as indicated above , both features are qualitatively visible in our comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "notably , the deviations from lda theory are smaller in al than in li . for example , the difference between the theoretical and experimental valence profiles at @xmath24 is approximately 16 % for li and 4.5 % for al,@xcite and the width of the peak at @xmath5 in the second derivatives is 0.23 a.u . in li and 0.15 a.u . in al ; thus , the `` blurring '' of the fermi cutoff is more severe in li than in al .",
    "these characteristic differences between li and al are partly related to the difference in the electron density of the two metals .",
    "the electron density in terms of @xmath31 ( the standard parameter for the volume per electron of valence electrons ) , is 3.21 for li and 2.12 for al .",
    "therefore , the bare coulomb interaction is more effectively screened in al than in li . as shown by a variety of treatments of the homogenous interacting electron gas , as the electron density increases , the kinetic energy dominates , and the momentum density is described more closely by the free - electron rectangular distribution with a step - wise cutoff at @xmath5.@xcite    figure 3 considers the effect of the isotropic lam - platzman ( lp ) correction on the [ 111 ] cp ; results along other directions are similar and are not shown in the interest of brevity .",
    "the theoretical curves in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] include the lp - correction , while those in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] do not . a comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with the last column of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that , although the inclusion of the lp - correction improves things , much of the discrepancy between theory and experiment still remains .",
    "interestingly , ref .",
    "has recently analyzed the correlation correction to the cp s of al in terms of a model which involves the break @xmath7 in the momentum density at @xmath5 as the only free parameter . by adjusting @xmath7 , ref .",
    "finds that the discrepancy between the lda predictions and the measurements can be essentially removed for a @xmath7 value between 0.7 and 0.8 , in reasonable accord with the corresponding theoretical values from various authors which are scattered between 0.76 and 0.85.@xcite there is no inconsistency between the present results and those of ref . .",
    "to see this relationship , recall that the standard lp - correction is defined via@xcite @xmath32 , \\label{equ:06}\\ ] ] where the integral extends over the wigner - seitz cell .",
    "the expression within the square brackets gives the difference between the momentum densities of the interacting and non - interacting _ homogeneous _ electron gas ( denoted by the superscripts ` int ' and ` ni ' ) evaluated at the local density @xmath33 of the physical system and @xmath34 is the corresponding electron density parameter .",
    "equation ( [ equ:06 ] ) thus attempts to take into account inhomogeneities in the electron gas , whereas the semi - empirical model of ref .",
    "replaces the integrand by its value at the average electron density in al .",
    "the matter is quite subtle , and further work is necessary in order to develop a satisfactory treatment of correlation effects on the momentum density in solids .    if the momentum density within the fermi sphere were flat and smooth , the first derivative @xmath35 shown in the middle row of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] would be a straight line up to the cutoff at the fermi momentum .",
    "however , at momenta less than the fermi radius some structure is visible notably in the [ 111 ] and the [ 100 ] derivatives . in this connection",
    ", we note that the fermi sphere overlaps with umklapp fermi spheres centered on the ( 111 ) reciprocal lattice points around the w - points in the brillouin zone .",
    "for example , the hexagonal zone face contains six w - points which all project at ( @xmath36 ) , _ i.e. _ , the point @xmath37 a.u . on the [ 111 ] axis .",
    "similarly , four w points in the first brillouin zone project at 0.41 a.u . and another four at 0.82 a.u . on the [ 100 ] direction .",
    "interestingly , the experimental as well as the theoretical derivatives contain structure around 0.7 a.u . in the [ 111 ] and 0.4 a.u . in the [ 100 ] cp .",
    "this indicates the importance of the k states near the w points with respect to the fine structure in the al cp s .",
    "incidentally , a structure similar to the wiggle around 0.4 a.u . in the [ 100 ] derivative has been observed in positron annihilation 1d - acar measurements by okada _",
    "et al._@xcite and 2d - acar measurements by mader _",
    "et al._@xcite who also ascribed it to zone - face interactions around the w - points .",
    "the directional differences , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , are a measure of the anisotropy . although the maximum difference is about 1 % of the peak value of the profile itself , they show definite structures which can have several origins .",
    "firstly , for different crystal orientations the plane of integration in eq .",
    "( [ equ:01 ] ) sweeps differently through the umklapp fermi spheres centered at the reciprocal lattice points in the higher brillouin zones .",
    "secondly , the fermi surface is slightly distorted from a sphere , as witnessed by the different fermi radii given above , while , thirdly , band - structure effects such as a * p * dependence of the momentum density within the fermi spheres and interactions of the electron bands with the brillouin zone faces with consequent distortion of the wavefunctions will also contribute to the anisotropy .",
    "the importance of the first point can be readily studied using a simple model of a spherical free - electron - like fermi surface surrounded by seven shells of similar umklapp fermi surfaces . the momentum density within each fermi surface",
    "is assumed to be constant and given by the square of the corresponding fourier component of the electron wave function at @xmath38.@xcite the cp for a given direction then consists of a superposition of inverted parabolas , centered at the projections on that direction of the reciprocal lattice points .",
    "the height of each parabola is proportional to the momentum density within the corresponding fermi sphere , while its cut - off points are found by adding or subtracting @xmath5 from the projected center .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the directional differences thus obtained .",
    "the positions of the cut - off points have been indicated by the arrows at the bottom of the graph , together with a symbol which denotes the direction of projection ( @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath41 $ ] ) and the coordinates of the center of the fermi sphere .",
    "it should be noted that many umklapp fermi spheres coincide in projection and therefore these coordinates are not unique ; the simplest set has been noted . the analysis in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows that much of the important structure in the directional differences stems from the @xmath42 umklapp contributions ; the other umklapps play a less important role .    a comparison of fig .  [ fig5 ] with the calculated differences in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows an overall qualitative correspondence in the succession of positive and negative peaks . on a more detailed scale , however , there are significant differences which have their origin in the other factors mentioned above .",
    "notable examples are the peaks around 0.85 a.u . in the @xmath43 }",
    "- j_{[100]}$ ] and @xmath43 } - j_{[110]}$ ] directional differences in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] which have no clear counterpart in fig .",
    "et al._@xcite have ascribed these features to the fact that in the @xmath44 $ ] direction the actual fermi surface bulges out beyond the free - electron fermi sphere in the second brillouin zone while there is a contraction in the third zone .",
    "this will strongly affect the @xmath44 $ ] profile but not so much the other two .",
    "our simple free - electron model of course does not contain this fermi surface distortion effect .",
    "the calculated curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , on the other hand , include all of these factors and reproduce the essential characteristics of the measured differences , although some discrepancies remain .",
    "it may be noted that non - locality of the exchange and correlation potential in li reduces the fermi surface anisotropy@xcite and thus would affect the anisotropy of the cp s . in this vein",
    ", lattice vibrations would reduce the umklapp contributions and hence the anisotropy of the momentum density . in how far such effects can explain the residual discrepancies in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] remains unclear .    in principle",
    ", the anisotropy in the momentum density may be obtained approximately by expanding both the momentum density and the cp s into lattice harmonics , and establishing the relation between the expansion coefficients for the momentum density and those for the cps.@xcite actually , eq .  ( [ equ:05 ] ) represents the @xmath45 term in such a scheme .",
    "however , we have not attempted to analyze our data along these lines since the number of measured profiles is not large enough .",
    "additional information may be gained from a comparison of cp s with the corresponding results of positron annihilation measurements .",
    "both experiments probe the momentum density  in positron annihilation one measures the momentum density of the annihilating electron - positron pair whereas in compton only the electron momentum density is involved . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the first derivative of the one - dimensional angular correlation of positron annihilation radiation ( 1d - acar ) profile measured by okada _",
    "et al._@xcite for the [ 111 ] orientation is compared with the corresponding cp .",
    "the momentum resolution of the 1d - acar is 0.11 a.u . which is almost the same as that of the present cp s .",
    "since the 1d - acar was area normalized to the theoretical 1d - acar calculated by kubo _",
    "et al._,@xcite the peak height at @xmath24 is almost the same as that of the present cp .",
    "the slope at the fermi momentum is steeper in the 1d - acar than in the cp , which is direct evidence for enhancement of the annihilation of positrons with the @xmath46 electrons near the fermi energy predicted first by kahana@xcite on the basis of an interacting electron gas model .",
    "also , the correlation tail for @xmath47 in the 1d - acar is weaker than its counterpart in the cp as a result of the partial cancellation of electron - electron and positron - electron correlation effects.@xcite finally , the fine structure at 0.2 a.u . and 0.7 a.u . is more pronounced in the 1d - acar than in the cp .",
    "this points to less correlation - induced smearing in positron annihilation compared to compton scattering .",
    "we have measured the compton profiles ( cp s ) of al along [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] directions at a photon energy of 59.38 kev and a momentum resolution of 0.12 au .",
    "parallel , highly accurate all - electron computations have been carried out within the lda - based band - theory framework .",
    "comparisons between theory and experiment at the level of the shapes of the cp s , structure in the 1st and 2nd derivatives of the cp s , and anisotropies obtained by taking differences between three pairs of cp s , all show a good level of accord . however , there are discrepancies as well . in comparison to the lda predictions ,",
    "the measured profiles are lower at low momenta , show a fermi cutoff which is broader , and display a tail which is higher at momenta above the fermi momentum .",
    "the inclusion of correlation effects in the lda via the standard isotropic lam - platzman correction improves things slightly , but the essential discrepancies remain .",
    "a model analysis in terms of directionally averaged cp s allows us to get a handle on the 3d momentum density of al ; in this way , we adduce that the experimental 3d density near p=0 does not differ significantly from lda predictions even though the cp s do . in this vein , cp s are computed using a model 3d distribution in which free electron spheres with appropriate weights are placed on reciprocal lattice points ( extending to seven shells around a central sphere ) to represent the higher momentum components in the electronic wave functions ; the results show that a significant amount of fine structure in the cp s is induced by these higher momentum components and by * k*-states near the w - points in the brillouin zone where the free electron spheres overlap .",
    "the present results when compared with those reported earlier on li show clearly that the size of discrepancies between theoretical and experimental cp s is markedly smaller in al than in li ; in particular , theoretical and experimental profiles at @xmath24 differ by 16@xmath48 in li but only by 4.5@xmath48 in al , and the peak width in the 2nd derivative at @xmath5 is 0.23 au in li but 0.15 au in al .",
    "it is thus clear that , with increasing electron density , the conventional picture of the electron gas becomes more representative of the momentum density and that shortcomings of the lda framework in describing the electron correlation effects become less important .",
    "finally , we compare briefly our [ 111 ] cp with the positron - annihilation ( 1d - acar ) measurements of okada et al . , and show that in the case of positron - annihilation the fermi cut - off is sharper and that there is less correlation induced smearing of structures in the acar spectrum . +    it is a pleasure to acknowledge important conversations with bernardo barbiellini .",
