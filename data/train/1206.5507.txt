    "bulges of disk galaxies can be classified into two types : classical bulges and pseudobulges .",
    "pseudobulges show substantial rotational support and disky or boxy / peanut edge - on isophoto shapes .",
    "pseudobulges are thus thought to have formed via secular evolution of discs @xcite .",
    "the standard picture of galaxy formation predicts that galaxies from through hierarchical merging that naturally produces classical bulges .",
    "however , more than half of bulges of nearby large disk galaxies are pseudobulges @xcite .",
    "therefore the high frequency of pseudobulges could be a challenge to the standard cosmology .    investigating formation processes of simulated bulges of disk galaxies",
    "should provide important clues for understanding of bulge formation .",
    "such simulations must resolve detailed structure of galaxies such as shape of bulges .",
    "only recently cosmological simulations with high enough resolution have become possible @xcite .    in this paper , we analyze the bulges of two milky way - sized galaxies formed in @xmath0cdm simulations ; the initial conditions are selected from the aquarius project @xcite : ` aq - c ' and ` aq - d ' in their labeling system .",
    "the simulation presented in this paper include a number of baryonic processes known to be relevant to galaxy formation .",
    "we make use of a model that has already had success in reproducing properties of the local group satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "the details of the simulations please refer to @xcite .",
    "in order to classify bulges , the srsic profile fitting for a surface stellar density profile is frequently used : @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the effective radius and @xmath3 is the surface density at this radius , respectively , and @xmath4 is the srsic index .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is well approximated by @xmath6 .",
    "bulges with @xmath7 are usually classified as pseudobulges .",
    "we show the evolution of the surface stellar density profiles in fig .  1",
    ". we fit each profile by a combination of the srsic and exponential profiles .",
    "we obtain @xmath8 and @xmath9 for aq - c and -d s bulges , respectively ; thus both bulges have pseudobulge - like profiles .",
    "we have confirmed that they not only show pseudobulge - like profiles , but they also have pseudobulge - like ` disky ' bulge shape ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .        in fig .  2",
    ", we show the formation histories of bulges stars , where we distinguish between stars born in the main progenitors ( in situ ) and those brought by accreted satellites ( accreted ) .",
    "as shown in the top panels , most of bulge stars are born in starbursts between redshift 2 and 6 in aq - c and between 2 and 4 in aq - d .",
    "thus , mergers do not contribute to the formation of the bulges .",
    "there is little star formation activity below redshift 1 in the bulge of aq - c ; aq - d s bulge show slight activity at this epoch .",
    "about half of the star formation in the bulge of aq - d below redshift 1 in the gas clumps . the contribution from the clumps is only about 10% .",
    "we have performed @xmath10-body / sph cosmological simulations of galaxy formation , in which two milky way - sized galaxy have formed : aq - c and aq - d . both galaxies have well - defined disks with the bulge - to - disk mass ratio , @xmath11 and 0.3 at redshift 0 . the sersic indices for aq - c s and aq - d s bulges are 1.2 and 1.4 , respectively .",
    "these values suggest that both bulges are pseudobulges .",
    "the pseudobulges mainly form by high - redshift starbursts before redshift 2 .",
    "the evolution of the surface stellar density profiles reveals that the pseudobulge components are already in place at redshift 23 as disky components with small scale length .",
    "the mass of these components at redshift 2 accounts for @xmath12% and @xmath13% of the final pseudobulge mass of aq - c and aq - d , respectively .",
    "these progenitors of the pseudobulges would be observed as high - redshift disks .",
    "the formation scenario of pseudobulges by high - redshift starbursts provides an explanation of pseudobulges in early - type disk galaxies such as s0 and sa galaxies .",
    "pseudobulges do exist in early - type disks and secular evolution may take too long to form such large pseudobulges .",
    "the simulations were performed with t2k - tsukuba at center for computational sciences in university of tsukuba .",
    "this work was supported by grant - in - aid for young scientists ( b : 24740112 ) and by mext hpci strategic program ."
