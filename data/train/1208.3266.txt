    "we expect that our considerations can also be applied to other graph based setups , such as those coming from quiver representations , e.g.  in field theory , or the coordinate changes in cluster algebras and varieties .",
    "mathematically , the initial data we start from is a finite graph @xmath0 together with a separable hilbert space @xmath1 for each vertex @xmath2 of the graph and a unitary morphism for each oriented edge , such that the inverse oriented edge corresponds to the inverse morphism .",

    "back this also yields a matrix representation of the hamiltonian in @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of vertices of @xmath0 .    from the noncommutative geometry point of view",
    "the @xmath3algebra @xmath4 represents a space . if @xmath4 is commutative ( since @xmath4 is unital ) this space can be identified as a compact hausdorff space @xmath7 such that the @xmath3algebra of complex valued continuous functions @xmath8 is isomorphic to @xmath4 . in the applications we consider @xmath7 is the momentum space , which in the commutative case is",
    "the n  dimensional torus @xmath9 and in the noncommutative case @xmath4 is the noncommutative @xmath10torus @xmath11 for a fixed value of @xmath12 , that in physical situations is given by a background b  field .",
    "see below  [ wiregeosec ] .",
    "concrete extended symmetry groups are constructed via a lift of the action of the underlying graph symmetries @xmath13 on this data as re  gaugings .",
    "the lift of the classical symmetries is rather complicated and proceeds in several steps :    \\(1 ) we first establish that the different matrix realizations of the hamiltonian given by choosing different rooted spanning trees and orders are all linked by gauge  transformations  see theorem [ regaugethm ] .",
    "the specific gauge transformations that arise form the re  gauging groupoid @xmath14 .",
    "it acts transitively on the set of all the matrix hamiltonians that can be obtained from the decorated graph by all different choices of data .",
    "using category theory these realizations are just kan  extensions given by pushing forward to the graph obtained by contracting the spanning tree .",
    "\\(2 ) we then show that the gauge transformations can be represented as conjugation with matrices with coefficients in @xmath4 .",
    "we prove that these matrices lead to a noncommutative 2cocycle .",
    "this in turn gives rise to a groupoid extension of @xmath14 .",
    "geometrically this corresponds to a gerbe .",
    "\\(3 ) in the commutative case (  [ compar ] ) , we furthermore show that these matrices give a _ projective _ representation of the re  gauging groupoid . just like in ordinary theory of projective representations",
    "this means that there is a _ bona fide _ representation of a central extension of this groupoid .",
    "\\(4 ) in the commutative setup , if we fix a point @xmath15 and evaluate the matrix hamiltonian with coefficients in @xmath4 at @xmath16 we obtain a matrix hamiltonian with coefficients in @xmath17 that we denote by @xmath18 . in this way we can think of @xmath7 as the base of a family of finite dimensional hamiltonians .",
    "likewise , the re  gauging actions give a groupoid representation in matrices @xmath19 which commute with @xmath20 .",
    "the stabilizer groups of a particular fixed hamiltonian are the sought after enhanced symmetry groups .",
    "\\(5 ) for applications this leaves the problem of identifying the points @xmath16 and the stabilizer groups or at least subgroups . to address the latter question",
    ", we establish that the automorphism group @xmath21 of the graph induces re  gaugings , by pushing forward the spanning tree and the order of the vertices . in this way , the symmetries of the graph give rise to a sub  groupoid of @xmath14 .",
    "going through the construction outlined above , we can restrict to this sub  groupoid and see that at a fixed point of the re  gauging action we get a projective representation of the stabilizer subgroup which leads to possible higher dimensional irreps and thus band sticking .",
    "\\(6 ) in order to identify points of @xmath7 which we take to be @xmath22 for concreteness where such enhanced symmetry groups can occur , we show that under certain assumptions , that hold in all cases of our initial physical interest , the operations of the symmetry group of the graph @xmath21 via re  gaugings lift to an action on the base torus @xmath22 ( theorems [ autothm ] and [ nondegthm ] ) . at points",
    "@xmath23 with non  trivial stabilizer groups , we automatically get a projective representation of these stabilizer subgroups of the automorphism groups of the underlying graph , which commutes with the hamiltonian . hence we get isotypical decompositions , which can give us non  trivial information about the spectrum using the arguments above .    we wish to point out that this approach is broader than that of considering classical symmetries of decorated graphs and in the commutative case generalizes the extensive analysis of @xcite , see  [ classympar ] for details .",
    "we apply all these considerations to the cases of the pdg wire networks and the honeycomb lattice ; see  [ calcpar ] . here",
    "the graph @xmath0 arises physically as the quotient graph of a given ( skeletal ) graph @xmath24 by a maximal translation group @xmath25 .",
    "each edge of the quotient graph is decorated with a partial isometry operator of translation in the direction of any lift of that edge to the graph @xmath26 .",
    "the harper hamiltonian is constructed from these isometries ; in the simplest version ( tight - binding approximation ) , it is simply the summation over them .",
    "this hamiltonian along with the symmetries of the given material are the main input into the noncommutative geometry machine , which constructs a @xmath3algebra that encodes relevant information about the system out of this data .",
    "one main objective is to analyze and understand the branching behavior or stated otherwise the locus of degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "the motivation is that in solid - state physics such degenerate eigenvalues may lead to novel electronic properties , as is the case , for instance , with the dirac points in graphene @xcite .",
    "the key observations are that ( a ) non  abelian extended symmetry groups by themselves can force degeneracies via higher dimensional i.e .",
    "@xmath27 irreducible representations and ( b ) any enhanced symmetries , also abelian ones , give rise to super  selection rules .",
    "the latter ones can facilitate finding the spectrum considerably , since the hamiltonian eigenspace decomposition has to be compatible with the isotypical decomposition of the representation .",
    "complementary to this group theoretic approach there is another one via singularity theory , which is contained in @xcite .",
    "our main result for the pdg and honeycomb networks is that both approaches yield the same classification of degeneracies in the commutative case .",
    "namely , at all degenerate points , which were analytically classified in @xcite , there is an enhanced symmetry group arising from graph automorphisms in the above way which forces the degeneracy . here",
    "the surprising fact is that we find _ all _ the degeneracies and degenerate points through the projective representations of ( subgroups of ) @xmath13 given by re  gaugings .    here",
    "the g  wire network corresponding to the double gyroid which was our original motivator is the most interesting case .",
    "as shown in @xcite there are exactly two points with triple degeneracies and two points with degeneracy @xmath28 , that is two doubly degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "the automorphism group of the graph is @xmath29 .",
    "the representation theory becomes very pretty in this case .",
    "there are two fixed points @xmath30 and @xmath31 on @xmath32 under the whole @xmath29 action .",
    "the projective representation is just the ordinary representation of @xmath29 by @xmath33 permutation matrices at the point @xmath30 which is known to decompose into the trivial and a 3dimension irreducible representation which forces the triple degeneracy .",
    "this result was also found by @xcite , where an initially different system was considered that results in the same spectrum .    at the point",
    "@xmath31 things become slightly more interesting .",
    "there is a projective representation of @xmath29 , but we can show that this projective representation corresponds to an extension which is isomorphic to the trivial extension . hence after applying the isomorphisms we have a representation of @xmath29 and",
    "there is a trivial and a 3-dim irrep , giving the second triple degeneracy .",
    "the elucidates the origin of the symmetry stated in @xcite .",
    "notice that the classical symmetries of decorated graphs would only yield an @xmath34 symmetry at this point , which can not explain a triple degeneracy as there are no 3-dim irreps for this group .",
    "things really get interesting at the two points @xmath35 . here",
    "the stabilizer group is @xmath36 .",
    "the projective representation gives rise to an extension which we show to be isomorphic to the non  trivial double cover @xmath37 of @xmath36 aka .",
    "2 t , the binary tetrahedral group or @xmath38 . using the character table",
    "we deduce that the representation decomposes into two 2dim irreps forcing the two double degeneracies .",
    "these are completely novel results .",
    "we wish to point out that one absolutely needs the double cover as @xmath36 itself has no 2-dim irreps and hence the projective extension is essential .",
    "we also use the fact that the diagonal of @xmath32 is fixed by a cyclic subgroup @xmath39 of @xmath36 in order to determine the spectrum analytically . here",
    "we use the super  selection rules .    for the d and honeycomb case",
    ", we show that the degenerate points which are well known in the honeycomb case and were computed for d in @xcite are all detected by enhanced symmetries .",
    "these however yield abelian representations and hence we have to use the arguments of the type ( b ) , that is super  selection rules , to show that the eigenvalues are degenerate over these points .",
    "similar results to ours have now also been independently found for the d case in @xcite using different methods .",
    "in this section , we show how to construct the @xmath3algebra @xmath4 and the hamiltonian @xmath40 mentioned in the introduction from a graph representation of a finite graph @xmath0 with @xmath6 vertices .",
    "furthermore we embed a copy @xmath4 into @xmath5 and define @xmath41 to be the subalgebra generated by @xmath42 and @xmath4 under this embedding .",
    "the pair @xmath43 is the basic datum for our noncommutative geometry .",
    "given a finite graph @xmath0 we define a groupoid representation of @xmath0 , an association of a separable hilbert space @xmath1 for each @xmath44 and an isometry @xmath45 for each directed edge @xmath46 from @xmath2 to @xmath47 .",
    "this data indeed determines a unique functor @xmath48 from the path groupoid of @xmath0 to the category of separable hilbert spaces .",
    "the path groupoid @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 for short ) of @xmath0 is category whose objects are the vertices of @xmath0 and whose morphisms are generated by the oriented edges , where the inverse of a morphism given by @xmath46 is the one given by @xmath51 .",
    "notice , that we are looking at the morphisms generated by the oriented edges , this means that @xmath52 is the set of paths along oriented edges from @xmath2 to @xmath47 modulo the relation that going back and forth along an edge is the identity .",
    "composition is only allowed if the first oriented edge terminates at the beginning of the second oriented edge .",
    "this is why we only obtain a groupoid and not a group .",
    "in particular , this lets one view the fundamental group @xmath53 in two equivalent fashions .",
    "first as the topological @xmath54 of the realization of a graph , and secondly as the group @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the morphisms in the path groupoid @xmath57 .",
    "the collection of automorphisms in @xmath50 forms a subgroupoid @xmath58 .",
    "it is the disjoint union @xmath59 .",
    "these are the classes of free loops on @xmath0 .",
    "given a groupoid representation as above , set @xmath60 and define @xmath42 by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the @xmath3 algebra of bounded operators on @xmath63 .",
    "we let @xmath4 be the _",
    "@xmath3algebra @xmath53 generates in @xmath62 via the representation .",
    "this is a bit subtle , as the concrete algebra depends on the choice of base point @xmath64 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath65 to emphasize this .",
    "of @xmath50 we denote the @xmath3subalgebra of @xmath62 generated by the morphisms of @xmath66 via @xmath67 by @xmath68 . ]    of course any two choices of a base vertex give isomorphic algebras but there is no preferred isomorphism between them . in the physical situation of wire networks , we are interested in  [ wiregeosec ] , there is however a global identification of these algebras which comes from the embedding of the system into euclidean space .",
    "algebraically we realize this as extra coherence isomorphisms @xmath69 with inverse @xmath70 .",
    "the direct sum of the @xmath71 gives a representation @xmath72 of @xmath4 into @xmath73 .",
    "the algebra @xmath41 is now the sub @xmath3algebra generated by @xmath42 and @xmath74 .",
    "we also set @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath3geometry we are interested in is the inclusion @xmath76 .",
    "we call the system commutative , if @xmath41 ( and hence @xmath4 ) is commutative .",
    "we call the situation _ fully commutative _ if in addition for any all @xmath2 and @xmath47 and any contractible edges path @xmath77 from @xmath2 to @xmath47 @xmath78 .    in the wire",
    " network case , the condition to be fully commutative corresponds to the case of zero magnetic field .",
    "notation : if we choose a fixed base point @xmath64 we will tacitly use the isomorphism @xmath79 to identify @xmath4 and @xmath80 .      if we fix a rooted spanning tree and an order on the vertices , we can identify @xmath81 via a unitary @xmath67 as follows and @xmath42 becomes equivalent to a matrix in @xmath5 .",
    "a spanning tree @xmath82 is by definition a contractible subgraph of @xmath0 which contains all the vertices of @xmath0 .",
    "it is rooted if one of the vertices is declared the root ; denote it by @xmath64 . in order to obtain a honest @xmath83 matrix",
    ", we also have fix an order @xmath84 on all the vertices , where we insist that the root is the first vertex in this order .",
    "that is we fix a rooted ordered spanning tree @xmath85 .    for each vertex @xmath2 of @xmath0",
    "there is a unique shortest path in @xmath82 to @xmath64 .",
    "this defines a choice of fixed isomorphism @xmath86 by translations along the edge path , see  [ isopar ] for details .",
    "assembling these maps gives the desired isomorphism @xmath81 .",
    "pulling back @xmath42 to @xmath87 using this isomorphism , we obtain _ a _ matrix version @xmath88 where we include the subscript to stress that this matrix depends on the choice of rooted ordered spanning tree @xmath89 .",
    "to fix the notation , which we will need later , we give the full details : let @xmath90 be the i  the vertex in the enumeration @xmath84 .",
    "then we obtain a matrix @xmath88 by using the isomorphisms @xmath91 which are defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath92 be the sequence of vertices along the unique shortest path @xmath93 from @xmath64 to @xmath90 in @xmath94 , then @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "given the choice of @xmath89 , we get the corresponding matrix hamiltonian as @xmath97    of course , all the @xmath98 are equivalent , although not canonically . for the equivalence one has to choose a path from one root to the other .",
    "we will exploit this fact extensively below .",
    "after having fixed an initial spanning tree the matrix hamiltonian has a different description .",
    "to each edge @xmath46 from @xmath2 to @xmath47 , we can associate @xmath99 . that is , we can regard @xmath0 as having a weight function on ordered edges with weights in @xmath100 . if @xmath101 is an edge of @xmath94 then with this definition @xmath102 .",
    "an alternative way of viewing this data is as a certain type of quiver representation , we will comment on this more below .      for any finite graph @xmath0",
    "the euler characteristic is @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the rank of @xmath105 which is the same as the `` number of loops '' .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath0 is connected , @xmath106 that is the free group in @xmath104 generators . in the applications @xmath104 is the rank of the lattice of translational symmetries .",
    "one way to view a rooted spanning tree ( @xmath107 is to think of it as fixing a base point @xmath64 and a set of symmetric generators / basis for @xmath108 .",

    "there are @xmath104 of these , one for each non  contracted edge .",

    "the weight function @xmath110 is a representation of @xmath54 lifted to the edges of the graph by the above correspondence .",

    "in all these situations theorem [ nondegthm ] applies .",
    "the upshot of the following calculations together with the analysis of @xcite is :    in all the examples pdg and honeycomb , all the fixed points come from fixed points of the semi  classical action .",
    "moreover the fixed points , stabilizer groups , their extensions and the decomposition into irreps for the case of the gyroid are given in table [ gyroidtable ] .",
    "for the calculations , we note that we are in the fully commutative case and hence corollary [ commcor ] applies .",
    "furthermore the graphs all have transitive symmetry groups , so that we only have to calculate for one source @xmath89 and can then transport the results by push ",

    "the graph @xmath0 in the gyroid case is the full square .",
    "it has symmetry group @xmath29 . with the gyroid weights ,",
    "the graph is faithful and hence the action can be lifted to an action on the torus .",
    "it acts transitively on all ordered spanning trees .",
    "such a spanning tree is fixed by specifying a root and the order .",

    "we fix an initial rooted spanning tree and order as in figure ( [ t12fig ] ) .",

    "a consequence is that the cycle @xmath412 acts as @xmath413 and is the cyclic permutation .",

    "this allows us to compute fixed points and stabilizer groups .",
    "we will first concentrate on non  abelian stabilizer groups .",
    "there are only two fixed points under the full @xmath29 action and these are @xmath417 and @xmath418 .",
    "the group @xmath36 , the subgroup of all even permutations , is the stabilizer group of the two points @xmath419 and @xmath420 .",
    "one can readily check that these are the only non  abelian stabilizer groups .",
    "the other possibility would be @xmath34 , but a short calculation shows that anything that is stabilized by any @xmath34 subgroup is stabilized by all of @xmath29 .",
    "we collect together the matrices @xmath221 needed for further calculation .",
    "again , we fix our initial ordered rooted spanning tree as before .    using short hand notation ,",
    "the matrix for the re  gauging induced by the transpositions @xmath421 from the initial spanning tree to the pushed forward one are @xmath422 the calculation for @xmath423 can be read off from figure [ t12fig ] . for this we read off the matrix @xmath233 from the re  gauging parameter and the matrix @xmath207",
    "is given by the permutation we are considering .",
    "the other calculations are similar .",
    "all other transpositions , viz .  those not involving @xmath194 , simply yield permutation matrices as there is no re  gauging involved .",
    "it is convenient to also have the following matrices as a reference : @xmath424 and finally @xmath425      at @xmath30 , the matrices @xmath426 give the usual representation of @xmath29 on @xmath403 . as is well known this representation decomposes into the trivial representation and an irreducible 3dim representation .",
    "this means that there is an at least 3fold degenerate eigenvalue @xmath247 .",
    "since the trace of @xmath42 is zero , we also know that the eigenvalues satisfy @xmath427 . plugging in @xmath428 , which spans the trivial representation",
    ", we see that @xmath429 and @xmath430 .      in this case , the matrices @xmath426 only give a projective representation .",
    "as one can check @xmath431 while @xmath432 for instance . define the 1cocycle @xmath247 by @xmath433 if @xmath194 appears in a cycle of length @xmath27 and @xmath194 else . so that @xmath434 while @xmath435 .",
    "then one calculates that @xmath436 has a trivial cocycle @xmath380 and thus @xmath263 is isomorphic to a true linear representation of @xmath29 . checking the characters",
    ", one sees again that in this case the irreducible components of @xmath437 , which also commute with @xmath42 are again the one  dimensional trivial representation and the 3dimensional standard representation .",
    "the trivial representation is spanned by @xmath438 .",
    "the eigenvalues are then readily computed to be @xmath194 with multiplicity @xmath196 and @xmath439 with multiplicity @xmath194 .",
    "we would like to remark that the choice of @xmath247 amounts to choosing a different gauge for the root vertex , namely @xmath440 instead of @xmath194 .",
    "notice that already in this case , even though there is no projective extension , our enhanced gauge ",
    "group is necessary . without it",
    "there would only be an @xmath34 action , those elements which involve no re  gauging .",
    "this smaller symmetry group is , however , not powerful enough to force the triple degeneracy , as @xmath34 has no irreducible @xmath196dim representation .",
    "these points are similar to each other .",
    "we will treat the first one in detail .",
    "again , we have only a projective representation of @xmath36 aka .  the tetrahedral group @xmath443 .",
    "namely , @xmath444 .",
    "again we can scale by a 1cocycle @xmath247 .",
    "this time @xmath445 , @xmath446 , @xmath447 if @xmath448 , and @xmath449 if @xmath450 .",
    "the resulting representation @xmath451 is then still a projective representation , but is it a representation of the unique non ",
    "trivial @xmath385 extension of @xmath36 , which goes by the names @xmath452 or the binary tetrahedral group .",
    "this group is well known .",
    "it is presented by generators @xmath453 and @xmath390 with the relations @xmath454 . in @xmath38 (",
    "that is the special linear group of @xmath455 matrices over the field with three elements @xmath456 ) , one can choose @xmath457 and @xmath458 .    for @xmath37 using a set theoretic section @xmath459 of the extension sequence @xmath460&\\z/2\\z\\ar[r]&2a_4\\ar@<1ex>[r]&a_4\\ar@<1ex>[l]^{\\wedge}\\ar[r]&1 } \\ ] ] and @xmath461 as a generator for @xmath385 , we can pick @xmath462 as generators .",
    "now we can check the character table , table [ chartable ] , and find that the representation @xmath463 over the complex numbers decomposes as the sum of two irreducible two  dimensional representations @xmath464 .",
    "in fact , these are the two representations into which the unique real irreducible 4dimensional representation of complex type splits over @xmath17 .",
    "the explicit computation for the representation @xmath465 is as follows .",
    "suppose the @xmath466 , where @xmath467 is the irrep with character @xmath468 .",
    "now @xmath469 , using the character table this implies that the coefficients @xmath470 and furthermore @xmath471 .",
    "we furthermore have that @xmath472 so that @xmath473 which together with ( * ) implies that @xmath474 .",
    "this fixes the decomposition into irreps . as a double check",
    "one can verify that the rest of the equations are also satisfied .",
    "so indeed we find that @xmath441 is a point with two eigenvalues with degeneracy @xmath195 .",
    "it is not hard to find ( e.g.  using the results of  [ superpar ] ) that these eigenvalues are @xmath475 .",
    ".[chartable ] character table of @xmath476@xcite , where @xmath477 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      to illustrate the power of the super  selection rules we consider the action of the cyclic group generated by @xmath478 .",
    "one can easily see that the fixed point set in the @xmath32 is the diagonal @xmath479 .",
    "the matrices @xmath364 actually give a _ bona fide _ representation of @xmath403 .",
    "this is the representation of @xmath39 given by cyclicly permuting the last three factors of @xmath17 .",
    "the action decomposes into irreps as follows : @xmath480 .",
    "where @xmath481 is the 1dimensional representation given by @xmath482 .",
    "the two trivial representations are spanned by @xmath483 and @xmath484 while the representation @xmath481 is spanned by @xmath485 and @xmath486 by @xmath487 .",
    "although we can not extract information about the degeneracies from this it helps greatly in determining the eigenvalues , since there are two irreps with multiplicity one each giving a unique 1dimensional eigenspace for the hamiltonian .",
    "hence we immediately get two eigenvalues . plugging @xmath47 and @xmath487 into @xmath143 one reads off",
    "@xmath488    the sum of the two trivial representations gives a 2dimensional isotypical component .",
    "therefore , we have to diagonalize @xmath42 inside this eigenspace .",
    "it is interesting to note that at the special points it is exactly this flexibility that is needed in order to allow for crossings .    to determine the two remaining eigenvalues @xmath489 and @xmath490",
    ", we apply @xmath42 to @xmath491 . the eigenvalue equation @xmath492 leads to the equations @xmath493 and @xmath494 ,",
    "fixing @xmath495 this gives the quadratic equation @xmath496 which has the two solutions @xmath497    this gives the spectrum along the diagonal which is given in figure [ dispersion ] .",
    "the calculation only involves the classical symmetries without re  gauging .     along the diagonal in @xmath32 ]    in @xcite",
    "the authors also assert that numerically they only found singular points in the spectrum along the diagonal .",
    "the fact that the arising candidates for dirac points are indeed such points and the analytic proof that indeed there are no other singular points in the spectrum is contained in @xcite .",
    "there is nothing much to say here .",
    "there is only the root of the spanning tree which is unique .",
    "the @xmath34 action permutes the edges and their weights .",
    "this yields the permutation action on the @xmath32 .",
    "there is no nontrivial cover and the eigenvalues remain invariant .      here",
    "things again become interesting . permuting the two vertices",
    ", we obtain eight fixed points if @xmath498 .",
    "the matrix for this transposition is @xmath499 .",
    "this gives super  selection rules and we know that @xmath500 and @xmath501 are eigenvectors . the eigenvalues being @xmath502 and @xmath503 at these eight points .",
    "we can also permute the edges with the @xmath29 action . in this case",
    "the @xmath34 action leaving the spanning tree edge invariant acts as a permutation on @xmath504 .",
    "the relevant matrices however are just the identity matrices and the representation is trivial .",
    "the transposition @xmath414 , however , results in the action @xmath505 on @xmath32 , see figure [ t12fig ] .",
    "so to be invariant we have @xmath506 , but this implies that @xmath423 is the identity matrix .",
    "invariance for @xmath507 and @xmath508 and the three cycles containing @xmath194 are similar . but , if we look at invariance under the element @xmath509 we are lead to the equations @xmath510 this has solutions @xmath511 , for these fixed points again we find only a trivial action .",
    "but for @xmath512 these give rise to the diagonal matrix @xmath513 and hence eigenvectors @xmath514 and @xmath515 , but looking at the hamiltonian , these are only eigenvectors if it is the zero matrix @xmath516 .",
    "indeed the conditions above imply @xmath517 .",
    "similarly , we find a @xmath385 group for @xmath518 and @xmath519 yielding the symmetric equations @xmath520 , @xmath521 and @xmath522 .",
    "these are exactly the three circles found in @xcite .",
    "going to bigger subgroups we only get something interesting if the stabilizer group @xmath398 contains precisely two of the double transposition above .",
    "that is the klein four group @xmath523 .",
    "the invariants are precisely the intersection points of the three circles given by @xmath524 and @xmath525 and its cyclic permutations",
    ".    these are three lines of double degenerate eigenvalue @xmath166 .",
    "these are not dirac points since there is one free parameter and hence the fibers of the characteristic map of @xcite are one dimensional which implies that the singular point is not isolated .",
    "this is very similar to the d story .",
    "the vertex interchange renders the fixed points @xmath526 which have eigenvectors @xmath527 as above and eigenvalues @xmath528 and @xmath529 respectively .",
    "the irreps of the @xmath39 action are @xmath530 .",
    "as far as the edge permutations are concerned the interesting one is the cyclic permutation @xmath531 which yields the equations @xmath532 for fixed points .",
    "hence @xmath533 .",
    "we get non  trivial matrices at the points @xmath534 and @xmath535 . at these points @xmath536",
    "are eigenvectors with eigenvalue @xmath166 and @xmath537 , since @xmath538 .",
    "they are exactly the dirac points of graphene .",
    "by considering re  gaugings , we have found the symmetry groups fixing the degeneracies of the pdg and honeycomb families of graph hamiltonians .",
    "the symmetries we used were those induced by the automorphisms of the underlying graphs . in our specific examples , all the graphs were highly symmetric , and hence had large automorphism group . here",
    "we stress that our symmetries are extended symmetries and not just the classical ones .",
    "the most instructive and interesting case is the action of the binary tetrahedral group giving rise to the dirac points in the gyroid network .",
    "note that as dimension@xmath166 objects , the dirac points for the gyroid are codimension3 defects in @xmath32 , rather than codimension-2 defects in @xmath539 as for the honeycomb lattice , which describes graphene .",
    "nevertheless , one may expect that they too lead to special physical properties .",
    "there are several questions and research directions that tie into the present analysis",
    ".    it would be interesting to find concrete examples of lifts of re  gaugings either in the noncommutative case or in the case of re  gaugings not induced by graph symmetries .",
    "one place where we intend to look for the former is in the noncommutative case of pdg and the honeycomb as we aim to probe the noncommutative / commutative symmetry mentioned in remark  [ symrmk ] .",
    "we are furthermore interested in how these symmetries behave under deformations of the hamiltonian and if they are topologically stable .",
    "a physically important type of deformations are those corresponding to periodic ( in space ) lattice distortions that describe crystals with lower spatial symmetry than those considered here .",
    "such distortions may occur for instance during synthesis of the structure @xcite .",
    "codimension-3 dirac points , such as those of the gyroid network , are especially interesting in this respect : they can be viewed as magnetic monopoles in the parameter space @xcite and as such are expected to be topologically stable .",
    "this makes the physics associated with such points immune to periodic lattice distortions .",
    "finally it seems that on the horizon there are connections between our theory and two other worlds . the first being quiver representations in general and the second being cluster algebras .",
    "the connection to the first is inherent in the subject matter , while the connection to the second needs some work .",
    "the point is that in our transformations , we change several variables at a time .",
    "nevertheless , the re  gauging groupoid can be viewed as a sort of mutation diagram .",
