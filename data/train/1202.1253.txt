    "the scattering theory of quantum transport has demonstrated to be a very successful tool for the study and design of novel nanodevices .",

    "the conductance of such a system in a two - terminal configuration can be obtained from the trace of the transmission matrix @xmath0 multiplied by its hermitian conjugate @xmath1 according to the landauer - bttiker formula @xmath2 @xcite . in a single channel device",
    "the conductance reduces to the modulus of the transmission probability @xmath3 through the channel and is easily measurable in experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "even if the phases of the scattering matrix of a mesoscopic system show an interesting behaviour @xcite , their direct measurement can not be done .",
    "one possible way to extract the phase of the transmission coefficient is to embed the system to measure in one of the arms of an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) interferometer . under the appropiate conditions it was shown to be possible to extract the transmission phase from the phase of the conductance oscillations of the whole structure as a function of the magnetic flux threading the ab ring @xcite .",
    "the pioneering ab experiments that tried to measure the transmission phase of transport through a quantum dot in the coulomb blockade ( cb ) regime used a two - terminal geometry . in this situation , onsager relations due to conservation of current and time - reversal symmetry imply that the conductance must be an even function of the magnetic flux and the measured transmission phase can only be @xmath4 or @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "later experiments used a six - terminal configuration with additional leads that modify the reprocity relations for transmission coefficients @xcite .",
    "the obtained transmission phase presented a smooth increase of @xmath5 as a function of a gate potential in the dot @xmath6 when a resonance peak was crossed while a sudden jump of @xmath7 ( a phase lapse following the experimentalists convention ) was observed between resonances . in a more recent experiment",
    "the transition between this regime , termed universal regime , and a mesoscopic regime where phase lapses and resonances occur randomly with respect to each other was studied as a function of the number of electrons in the dot @xcite .",
    "these observations have given rise to a whole body of literature devoted to study the transmission phase of quantum dots .",
    "many theoretical works @xcite were concerned with explaining the experimental results , in particular , the universal regime for the transmission phase which is at odds with the standard models for cb phenomena .",
    "recent progress in that direction was obtained studying the statistical properties of the parity correlations between succesive wave functions in ballistic chaotic quantum dots @xcite .",
    "another interesting path followed for the analysis of the experimental results is a many - body extension of the constant - interaction model ( cim ) for the description of resonances in quantum dots @xcite . in the regime where the distance between resonances is much smaller than the width of the resonant levels karrasch _ et al .",

    "the problem can be formulated using the keldysh approach @xcite .",
    "however , the calculations using keldysh green functions for interacting systems can usually only be performed within some approximation @xcite .",
    "there are also many numerical methods in the literature but none are without problems .",
    "the more generally applicable ones rely on extensive real time simulations , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , the computing power needed for the application of these methods limits their practical implementations for strongly correlated systems .",
    "a more recent approach is based on the exact diagonalization of teh full but isolated , many - body system , and accordingly treats tunneling perturbatively @xcite .",
    "it obviously is restricted to small systems .",
    "other types of approaches rely on the calculation of an equilibrium quantity that can be related to the conductance .",

    "the ground state properties of the combined system pierced by a magnetic flux can be related to the scattering properties of the embedded system . in this section ,",
    "we show the main steps of the derivation of the method . we follow closely the approach that allows to extract the modulus of the transmission amplitude presented in appendix a of ref .",
    "moreover , we extend the method to calculate also the phase of the transmission amplitude . we will limit ourselves to the case of a single channel in the leads which is the simplest one although generalizations of the method to more than one channel have been reported @xcite .",

    "the transmission amplitude is given by @xmath19 .",
