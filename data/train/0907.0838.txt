    "the interaction of @xmath0 two - level systems ( qubits ) with a common single - mode quantum bosonic field is a paradigmatic example of collective quantum behavior .",
    "dating back to the model put forward by dicke , @xcite , this has become one of the most investigated problems in quantum optics and condensed matter physics , with proposed physical implementations ranging from superconducting nano - devices , @xcite , to ultracold atoms and bose - einstein condensates in cavity @xcite .",
    "the dicke model exhibits a second - order phase transition @xcite , and , due to its broad application range @xcite , it has been studied extensively in the past few years , @xcite .",
    "it displays a rich dynamics , with many non - classical features @xcite ; in particular , the ground state entanglement @xcite and the berry phase @xcite of the dicke model have been diffusely analyzed and many aspects of its finite size behavior have been obtained @xcite .",
    "the continued interest in the dicke model also stems from the fact that it pertains to the same universality class as other intensely studied many - body systems that possess infinite - range interactions , and for which theoretical models typically allow for exact solutions in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the most general collective model of ( effective ) spin @xmath1 systems , the biaxial model in arbitrary field , can be described by the hamiltonian ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) @xmath2 where the @xmath3 are the collective pauli operators that obey angular momentum - like commutation relations @xmath4=2i\\epsilon_{ijk}{\\hat{s}}_{k}$ ] .",
    "the energy eigenstates can be written in the angular momentum basis ( we employ the standard one , apart from a factor @xmath5 in the definitions ) @xmath6 constructed as the set of common eigenstates of both @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for a ferromagnetic interaction @xmath9 , the ground state of the hamiltonian belongs to the symmetric sub - space with @xmath10 and special and diffusely studied cases are the biaxial model in a transverse field ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 ( the well - known lgm model @xcite ) and the uniaxial model ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 .    under the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the phase diagram of these collective spin models has been simply established by a mean field approach @xcite .",
    "for @xmath0 large but finite , purely quantum effects become important and numerical analysis have been implemented using the continuous unitary transformation method @xcite and a semiclassical approach @xcite .",
    "a qualitative understanding of the lgm - model is obtained in ref.@xcite introducing a double well structure above the phase transition in a semiclassical treatment of the system .    in the present work ,",
    "we establish an exact relationship between the dicke model in the adiabatic regime ( i.e. for the case of slow qubits coupled to a faster oscillator mode ) and the uniaxial model , which is valid not only in the thermodynamic limit , but also for any finite number @xmath0 of spins .",
    "we then present an alternative analytic method which relies on a continuum approach to solve the collective uniaxial model for large @xmath0 .",
    "we show that this method is useful to determine the finite size behavior and the entire @xmath15 expansion ( i.e. , critical exponents and pre - factors ) at the critical point for both of the dicke and the collective uniaxial spin models .",
    "these results corroborate several studies in which the exponents have already been derived .",
    "the objective of the present study is thus threefold , and the paper is organized accordingly : first , we consider the dicke model in the regime in which the frequency of the quantum field is much larger than the energy spacing of the qubits ; in this case , the field degree of freedom can be adiabatically separated from the qubit ones and an effective @xmath0-qubit interaction can be obtained by means of the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "this is done in sec.[sect2 ] , where the relationship with the uniaxial model is established for any energy eigen - state .",
    "afterwards , we focus on the quantum phase transition of this collective model ( sec .",
    "[ sect3 ] ) for which we derive the @xmath15 expansion for some relevant physical observables and we also compute exactly various entanglement measures for the qubits . finally , using these results together with those obtained in sec .",
    "[ sect2 ] , we obtain analogous @xmath15 expansions for the dicke model ( sec . [ sect4 ] ) .",
    "a summary and some concluding remarks are finally given in sec .",
    "[ sect5 ] .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 qubits interacting with a single harmonic oscillator mode , described by the hamiltonian ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the annihilation operator for the field mode of frequency @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the transition frequency of the qubit , @xmath21 is the level asymmetry and @xmath22 is the strength of the coupling between the oscillator and the two - level systems .",
    "we assume a _ slow _ qubit and work in the regime @xmath23 by employing the born - oppenheimer approximation , @xcite .",
    "the standard procedure is to separate the hamiltonian of eq.([1 ] ) in two parts , containing slow and fast variables , respectively @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 the eigenstates of the composite system can be written as a coherent superposition of the eigenkets of @xmath26 , having a parametric dependence on ( i.e. conditioned by ) the values of the slow variables : @xmath27\\rangle,\\,(r=0,\\dots , s)\\ ] ] where the displaced number states of the oscillator are given by @xmath28 they are the eigenstates of the fast hamiltonian @xmath29\\rangle = v_n(s_z)|n\\left[s_z\\right]\\rangle      \\ , , \\ ] ] with eigenvalues @xmath30 for different n , @xmath31 contribute an effective adiabatic potential felt by the slow subsystem so that the wave function @xmath32 of the @xmath0 qubit system is determined by @xmath33 where the effective hamiltonian is reduced to the form @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the hamiltonian of the uniaxial model introduced in the previous section , with coupling constant @xmath36 : @xmath37    the ground state of the coupled qubit - oscillator system is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 .    the uniaxial ( as well as the lgm model ) and the dicke model are known to be equivalent in the thermodynamic limit . from the discussion of this section",
    ", we see that there is a strict relationship between the ground states of the two model - systems as both can be expressed in the angular momentum basis with the same amplitudes @xmath40 .",
    "however , this last equation shows that at finite size there can be differences between their behaviors since , in the case of the dicke model these coefficients gets effectively modified due to the presence of the displacement operator , whose argument depends explicitly on the number of qubits @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that we will find small differences in the @xmath15 expansions for the two models .",
    "in order to continue the discussion on the dicke model , we need to evaluate the amplitudes @xmath40 . therefore , we now turn our attention to the uniaxial model with @xmath0 qubits .",
    "once the coefficients @xmath40 are obtained , we will use them in sec .",
    "[ sect4 ] to complete the description of the finite size behavior the dicke model .",
    "the hamiltonian of a uniaxial model for a spin system with a collective coupling can be written as @xmath41 with @xmath42 and where we have re - scaled the ferromagnetic coupling constant by the number of spins , @xmath43 .",
    "this is equivalent to the more diffusely found @xmath44 hamiltonian , that can be obtained after the rotation @xmath45 .    to connect this model to the discussion of the previous section , one simply has to take @xmath46 .",

    ", the ground state can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath40 are real coefficients .",
    "we limit our present discussion to the case of the symmetric phase @xmath51 , that is the one relevant for the description of the dicke phase transition occurring at @xmath51 with @xmath52 , corresponding to @xmath53 .    in the angular momentum basis ,",
    "the hamiltonian takes a @xmath54 tri - diagonal symmetric ( jacobi ) matrix form with double symmetries along both the main and the second diagonal : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 these coefficients satisfy a confluence property @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 as @xmath61 @xcite . by application of theorems on the zeros of orthogonal polynomials",

    ", we can check the continuum approximation by comparing it to the behavior obtained by solving the tridiagonal matrix numerically . in fig.([wf0 ] ) @xmath40 for @xmath89 is shown with @xmath90 and @xmath91 compared with the analytic expressions of eqs.([phim]-[phim2 ] ) .",

    "we have discussed the finite size critical behavior of the dicke model for the case of a fast oscillator coupled to many slower qubits .",
    "we have derived a direct relationship between this system and the uniaxial model , describing the collective interaction among qubits residing on a fully connected graph . in particular , we have obtained a precise one - to - one correspondence between the energy eigen - states of the two models , showing that their critical behavior are closely related both in the thermodynamic limit and at finite size .",
    "we have then , adopted a continuum approximation in order to describe analytically the ground state of the uniaxial model which we used to re - obtain all the known features of the model , such as its critical exponents .",
    "we have also obtained a full characterization of the @xmath15 expansion ( including non universal features such as the pre - factors ) for many physical observables , among which we dedicated a particular emphasis to the description of the entanglement content of the ground state and to its critical behavior .    using the solution obtained for the uniaxial model , we were then able to go back to the original dicke model and to describe its critical behavior and its scaling properties , again obtaining not only the scaling exponents for various physical quantities , but their entire @xmath15 expansions ( of which the first terms are shown and discussed explicitly ) .",
    "the two models we have discussed obviously differ because of the presence of the bosonic mode in the dicke case . from a physical point of view",
    "this implies that an entanglement is built up not only among the qubits ( as in the uniaxial model ) but also between qubits and oscillator .",
    "formally , this manifests itself in the fact that the oscillator state is a displaced vacuum ( i.e. coherent ) state conditioned on the qubit magnetization in the direction of the coupling ( i.e. , on the value of @xmath177 , in our notation ) .",
    "the presence of these quantum correlation with the oscillator also modifies the entanglement among qubits ( formally , because of the presence of some exponential pre - factors that essentially suppress entanglement ) , and this can be interpreted in terms of the monogamy of entanglement .",
    "apart from this , the two models have many features in common ; in particular , their critical behavior are closely related and their quantum phase transition are essentially the same , occurring at the same point in parameter space ( once the proper relationship between the physical parameters is taken into account ) .",

    "<S> we discuss the finite size behavior of the adiabatic dicke model , describing the collective coupling of a set of @xmath0-two level atoms ( qubits ) to a faster ( electromagnetic ) oscillator mode . </S>",
    "<S> the energy eigen - states of this system are shown to be directly related to those of another widely studied collective spin model , the uniaxial one . by employing an approximate continuum approach </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a complete characterization of the properties of the latter , which we then use to evaluate the scaling properties of various observables for the original dicke model near its quantum phase transition . </S>"
