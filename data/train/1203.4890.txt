    "since the observation of the quantum phase transition from superfluid ( sf ) to mott insulator ( mi )  @xcite , systems of ultracold gases confined in optical lattices have provided an ideal venue for studying strong correlation physics  @xcite .",
    "many interesting properties of strongly correlated ultracold gases have been revealed in recent experiments , including excitation spectra  @xcite , quantum criticality  @xcite , and particle transport  @xcite .",
    "in particular , transport properties have attracted much interest , in connection with the sf critical momentum above which superflow breaks down . in experiments with ultracold gases in optical lattices",

    "in addition to optical lattices , new possibilities for the study of strong correlation physics have been opened up by the creation of ultracold atomic gases with strong magnetic dipole - dipole interactions  @xcite and gases of polar molecules  @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted that when a dipolar bose gas is loaded on an optical lattice , there exist supersolid ( ss ) phases that possess both diagonal ( crystalline ) and off - diagonal ( superfluid ) long - range order  @xcite .",

    "secondly , solving the equation of motion numerically , we simulate the dynamics of dipole oscillations of bose gases confined in a parabolic potential both in the absence and the presence of the dipole - dipole interactions . for both cases ,",
    "we find significant damping of the dipole oscillations when the maximum local momentum exceeds a certain critical value , and that the critical value coincides with the critical momentum for the di in the homogeneous lattice systems .",
    "we also find a parameter region in which the dipole - oscillation mode is resonantly coupled with the breathing mode .",

    "we have found that the critical momentum defined by the maximum local momentum in the trap system quantitatively agrees with that in the homogeneous system at unit filling .",
    "we have also shown that a resonance phenomenon is caused by the coupling between the dipole - oscillation mode and the breathing mode . moreover , we have investigated the critical momentum of dipolar hardcore bosons and shown that the critical momentum of the ss state is smaller than that of the sf state as in the case of the homogeneous system .",
    "this result allow us to suggest that the ss state should be identified by measuring the critical displacement .",
    "we finally showed that the dynamical transition from sf state to ss state can be induced by dipole oscillations .",
