    "in higher order calculations there is in general an ambiguity in the prediction for the physical quantities which can be traced back to the adopted renormalization scheme .",
    "different renormalization conditions imply different numerical values for the parameters of the underlying theory .",
    "very often it is useful to convert them from one scheme into an other in order to compare the final predictions for the observables in both schemes .    in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "practical calculations are very often performed in the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath0 ) scheme  @xcite leading to the definition of the so - called short - distance @xmath0 mass .",
    "the @xmath0 mass occupies a distinguished place among various mass definitions .",
    "first , it is a truly short distance mass not suffering from nonperturbative ambiguities .",
    "second , the @xmath2 mass proves to be extremely convenient in multi - loop calculations of mass - dependent inclusive physical observables dominated by short distances ( for a review see  @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    "the experiments often provide masses which are tightly connected to the on - shell definition .",
    "thus , conversion formulae are needed in order to make contact between theory and experiment . the two - loop relation between @xmath0 and",
    "the on - shell definition of the quark mass has been obtained in  @xcite and has been confirmed in  @xcite . until recently the accuracy of this equation was enough for the practical applications . meanwhile ,",
    "however , new computations have become available which require the relation between the @xmath0 and on - shell mass at @xmath3 in order to perform a consistent analysis .",
    "the necessity of an accurate determination of the quark masses , especially those of the top and bottom ones , is demonstrated by the following two examples .",
    "the main goal of the future @xmath4 physics experiments is the determination of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements which will give deeper insight into the origin of cp violation and possibly also provides hints to new physics .",
    "in particular the precise measurement of @xmath5 is very promising .",
    "it is determined from semileptonic @xmath4 meson decay rates .",
    "thus it is desirable to know the bottom quark mass as accurately as possible as it enters already the born result to the fifth power .",
    "one of the primary goals of a future electron - positron linear collider or muon collider will be the precise determination of the top quark properties , especially its mass , @xmath6 . in hadron colliders like the fermilab tevatron or the large hadron collider",
    "the top quarks are reconstructed from the invariant mass of the @xmath7 bosons and the bottom quarks . on the contrary in lepton colliders",
    "it is possible to determine the top quark mass from the line shape of the production cross section @xmath8 close to the threshold .",
    "simulation studies have shown that an experimental uncertainty of about @xmath9  mev in the top mass determination can be achieved  @xcite .",
    "thus also from the theoretical side the ambiguities have to be controlled with the same precision .",
    "threshold phenomena are conveniently expressed in terms of the pole mass , @xmath10 , of the corresponding quark as this parameter naturally appears in the equations which have to be solved .",
    "the pole mass is a gauge invariant , infrared - finite and a renormalization scheme independent quantity  @xcite .",
    "however , various calculations  @xcite have shown that higher order corrections have an significant influence on the predictions for the quark production cross section . it has been shown that this is connected to the definition of the quark mass used for the parameterization of the cross section  @xcite .",
    "a common remedy is the introduction of a new mass parameter which is supposed to be insensitive to long distance phenomena .",
    "one thus often speaks about short - distance masses .",
    "the relation of the new mass parameter to the pole mass is used in order to re - parameterize the threshold phenomena .",
    "on the other hand a relation of the new quark mass to the @xmath0 mass must be established as it is commonly used for the parameterization of those quantities which are not related to the threshold .",
    "recently several groups evaluated next - to - next - to - leading order results for the cross section @xmath11 close to threshold  @xcite . in order to establish a consistent relation to the @xmath0 mass the three - loop relation between the @xmath0 and the on - shell",
    "mass is needed .",
    "this will be discussed in section  [ sec : appl ] .",
    "the bottom quark mass can be obtained from sum rules for the @xmath12 mesons  @xcite .",
    "the current strategy can be schematically outlined as follows  @xcite .",
    "moments of the current correlator involving bottom quarks are determined with the help of experimental results on the electronic decay width and the masses of the @xmath12 mesons .",
    "they are compared with the moments computed with the help of non - relativistic qcd . due to the strong dependence on the bottom quark mass a precise determination is possible . recently",
    "a next - to - next - to - leading order computation has become available  @xcite .",
    "again , for a consistent determination of the @xmath0 mass the order @xmath13 relation to the on - shell mass is necessary .",
    "a somewhat different approach for the determination of both the charm and bottom mass has been performed in  @xcite .",
    "the lower states in the heavy quarkonium spectrum have been computed up to order @xmath14 which again demands for the three - loop @xmath0on - shell mass relation in order to evaluate the @xmath0 mass .",
    "another application where the three - loop relation between the on - shell and the @xmath0 mass is needed is connected the recent evaluation of the quartic mass corrections at order @xmath13 to the cross section @xmath15  @xcite . for conceptual reasons",
    "the calculation has been performed using the @xmath0 mass .",
    "if , however , the result should be expressed in terms of the pole mass the corresponding relation has to be known to order @xmath13 .",
    "note the born result expanded for small quark masses does nt have a quadratic term .",
    "thus in this case the mass relation is only needed up to order @xmath16 and the quartic corrections require for the first time the @xmath3 terms .    in the present article",
    "we describe the calculation of the @xmath17 correction to the mass relation as well as the implications of the result .",
    "a short version containing the main results has been published in  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "the notation is introduced . afterwards in section  [ sec : method ] the method we use for the calculation is described in detail . its power is demonstrated in section  [ sec:12loop ] at the one- and two - loop level where a comparison with the exact results is possible .",
    "the tools needed for the three - loop calculation are presented in section  [ sec : master ] . in particular",
    "we collect all difficult integrals which are needed for the computation of the fermion propagator .",
    "the three - loop results for the mass relation are finally discussed in section  [ sec:3loop ] and their implications to quark production processes are mentioned in section  [ sec : appl ] .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "this section is devoted to set up the notation . throughout this paper",
    "the bare ( unrenormalized ) mass is denoted by @xmath18 and the @xmath0 and on - shell renormalized ones by @xmath19 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "their connection is given by the following equations @xmath20 where @xmath21 is finite and has an explicit dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath22 .",
    "the main goal of this paper is the computation of @xmath21 up to order @xmath13 .",
    "therefore three - loop corrections to the fermion propagator have to be considered .",
    "a convenient variable in this context is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the external momentum of the fermion propagator .",
    "the inverse quark propagator is denoted by @xmath25 \\label{eq : sfinv0 } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 depend on the external momentum @xmath24 , the bare mass @xmath18 and on the bare strong coupling constant @xmath28 .",

    "@xmath30 @xmath31 denotes the wave function renormalization in the @xmath0 scheme which is sufficient for our considerations .",
    "note that the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are @xmath0 quantities which later on are expressed in terms of the on - shell mass .",
    "the two - loop relation between @xmath19 and @xmath10 is enough to do this at order @xmath13 .",
    "it is convenient to write the functions @xmath34 in the following way : @xmath35 where the quantities @xmath36 exhibit the following colour structures ( the indices @xmath37 and @xmath38 are omitted in the following ) : @xmath39 the same decomposition also holds for the function @xmath21 . in  ( [ eq : deccf ] ) @xmath40",
    "represents the number of light ( massless ) quark flavours .",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 are the casimir operators of the fundamental and adjoint representation . in the case of @xmath43",
    "they are given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the trace normalization of the fundamental representation is @xmath46 .",
    "the subscripts @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deccf ] ) shall remind on the colour factors @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "@xmath51 simply stands for the colour factor @xmath52 .    at one- and two - loop order",
    "the results for @xmath21 read  @xcite @xmath53 with @xmath54 where after the approximation signs the choice @xmath55 has been adopted . for later use",
    "we also define the propagator of the gluon . in t",
    "hooft - feynman gauge it is given by @xmath56",
    "a formula which allows for the computation of the @xmath0on - shell relation for the quark mass is obtained from the requirement that the inverse fermion propagator has a zero at the position of the on - shell mass : @xmath57 at order @xmath13 this requires the evaluation of three - loop on - shell integrals .",
    "currently it is quite unhandy to deal with such kind of diagrams as up to now the literature lacks of a useful description of an algorithm for their computation . even though the technology is in principle available as it was needed for the computation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon  @xcite .",
    "we have decided to choose a different way for the practical calculation .",
    "the starting point is , of course , also eq .",
    "( [ eq : oscond ] ) . applying it to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sfinv ] ) leads to the condition @xmath58 at a given loop - order @xmath49 the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : svss ] ) are inserted and the resulting equation is solved for @xmath59 .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) can be cast in the form @xmath60 our aim is the computation of @xmath61 . note that the individual self energies @xmath62 and @xmath63 develop infra - red singularities when they are evaluated on - shell . the proper combination which leads to the relation between the @xmath0 and on - shell mass is , however , free of infra - red problems .    at this point a comment in connection to eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) is in order .",
    "in fact also more involved equations could be chosen which result in more complicated expressions for @xmath64 . to us",
    "the choice in  ( [ eq : f ] ) appears very natural .",
    "furthermore the one- and two - loop results are reproduced with rather high accuracy .",
    "we also tried various other options ; the final results , however , remained the same .",
    "the strategy for the computation of @xmath61 is as follows  @xcite : expansions for small and large external momentum are computed for the quark self energies . after building the proper combinations needed for @xmath64 a conformal mapping  @xcite",
    "is performed @xmath65 which maps the complex @xmath66-plane into the interior of the unit circle in the @xmath67-plane .",
    "the relevant point @xmath68 is mapped to @xmath69 .",
    "the motivation for this conformal mapping is based on the observation that the application of a pad approximation relies heavily on analytic properties . actually , @xmath64 develops a branch cut along the real @xmath66-axis starting from @xmath70 .",
    "this cut is mapped through eq .",
    "( [ eq : confmap ] ) onto the unit circle of the @xmath67 plane .",
    "thus by applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : confmap ] ) the radius of convergence is enlarged . in order to ensure also the convergence at the boundary a pad approximation is performed . in the variable @xmath67 it is defined through @xmath71(\\omega ) & = & \\frac{a_0+a_1\\omega+\\ldots+a_m\\omega^m }                         { 1   + b_1\\omega+\\ldots+b_n\\omega^n } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : padedef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the details for the construction of the pad approximants can be found in  @xcite .",
    "special care has to be taken with the logarithms @xmath72 which occur in the results of the high - energy expansions as they could destroy the convergence properties of the described procedure .",
    "details on their treatment can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the described procedure is applied to each colour structure occurring in @xmath64 separately .",
    "if we assume that the decomposition introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : decas ] ) and  ( [ eq : deccf ] ) also holds for @xmath64 the following equations are obtained @xmath73 the colour structures @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 contain next to linear terms also products of lower order contributions .",
    "it was already realized in  @xcite that the pad procedure described above shows less stability as soon as diagrams are involved which exhibit more than one particle threshold . in our case",
    "the interest is in the lowest particle cut which happens to be for @xmath79 .",
    "the pad method heavily relies on the combination of expansions in the small and large momentum region . the large momentum expansion",
    ", however , is essentially sensitive to the highest particle threshold .",
    "thus , if this threshold numerically dominates the lower - lying ones it can not be expected that the pad approximation leads to stable results . in such cases a promising alternative to the above method",
    "is the one where only the expansion terms for @xmath80 are taken into account in order to obtain a numerical value at @xmath79 .",
    "this significantly reduces the calculational effort as the construction of the pad approximation from low - energy moments alone is much simpler . in practice",
    "this approach will be applied if the pad results involving also the high - energy data looks ill - behaved .    in the present analysis diagrams with other cuts than for @xmath79 are already present at the two - loop level ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : diags ] ) which allows us to test these suggestions . also at three - loop order either @xmath79 or @xmath81 cuts appear .",
    "cuts involving five or more fermion lines are first possible starting from four - loop order .",
    "note that cuts involving an even number of fermions can not occur .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in fact , in  @xcite the pole mass of the bottom quark is given with a accuracy of order @xmath16 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "for the conversion to the @xmath0 scheme relation  ( [ eq : zmzm2 ] ) is needed up to one , two and three loops , respectively .",
    "the same accuracy is required for the running of @xmath82 from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "our results are displayed in tab .",
    "[ tab : mbmb ] . as in  @xcite the value",
    "@xmath85 has been adopted .",
    "the numerical values slightly differ from the ones given in  @xcite which can be traced back to a minor inconsistent treatments in  @xcite . thus taking over",
    "the error estimates from  @xcite the on - shell value for the bottom quark mass reads @xmath86 .",
    "it transforms to the following value for @xmath87 @xmath88    in a similar way also the results for the charm quark mass can be obtained .",
    "in addition to the bottom quark case the matching between four and five flavours has to be performed consistently .",
    "this means that @xmath89-loop running has to be accompanied with @xmath90-loop matching . for a detailed description",
    "we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the on - shell value  @xcite @xmath91 leads to @xmath92 where again the error estimates are taken over from  @xcite .",
    "compared to  @xcite the inclusion of the @xmath17 terms leads to a shift in the central values of more than @xmath9  mev . in the case of the bottom quark",
    "this change is even larger than the errors presented in  @xcite which might indicate that the estimates were too optimistic .",
    "this demonstrates that a consistent treatment of the different orders in @xmath82 is absolutely crucial .",
    "we would like to mention that in this paper we do nt intend to compare and judge the different methods used for extracting the bottom quark mass and the corresponding error estimate . for a comprehensive discussion of recent determinations of @xmath87",
    "we refer to the third reference in  @xcite .",
    "in this paper the three - loop term of order @xmath13 to the relation between the @xmath0 and on - shell definition of the quark mass is computed .",
    "this is achieved by considering expansions of the quark self energy for small and large external momentum followed by a conformal mapping and a pad approximation .",
    "the three - loop computation in the limit of small momentum requires the knowledge of integrals which before have never been used in practical applications . we have checked the results available in the literature and added analytical results for the missing integrals .",
    "the procedure used for the computation is tested in detail at one- and two - loop order and compared to the known result .",
    "this also provides an estimate on the uncertainty which is between 2  and 3% for the order @xmath13 contribution .",
    "we discuss several important applications of the newly available term .",
    "in particular the relations between the @xmath0 mass and other short - distance masses are considered .",
    "it is shown that the three - loop term is necessary to reduce the error with which finally the @xmath0 quark mass can be determined .    in conclusion",
    "we would also like to stress that our procedure is not limited to the determination of the conversion factor between the @xmath0 and on - shell quark masses . as a spin - off we also got a wealth of information about the ( perturbative ) quark propagator in qcd at order @xmath13 .",
    "it should be possible to use this approach in order to find an accurate semianalytic description of the propagator in all possible regions of momentum transfer and for a general gauge fixing condition .",
