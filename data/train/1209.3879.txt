    "silicon monoxide ( sio ) maser emission has been used as an important probe of the dynamical structure and the physical condition of the inner circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and post - agb stars .",
    "the pumping mechanism of the sio masers is still an open question and understanding of it is essential to the diagnostics of the cses through observed behaviors of clump clusters of the masers such as temporal variations of the flux density , angular distribution , and three - dimensional velocity structure .",
    "sio maser emissions of @xmath6 @xmath1 , @xmath2 @xmath7 , and @xmath6 @xmath8 have been main targets of very long baseline interferometric ( vlbi ) observations ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath1 maser line is also a unique target ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ; @xcite ) .",
    "this transition is located at an energy level higher by @xmath94 000  @xmath10 ( @xmath95 800  k ) than the rotational transitions in the vibrational ground state and it needs considerably strong excitation in the gas at a temperature of 2 0003 000  k of the surface of agb and post - agb stars .",
    "observations of this maser line may be a good test for currently most plausible maser pumping model ( line - overlapping , @xcite and references therein ) . however , its detection in vlbi observations is difficult due to its extreme weakness @xcite .    by the way ,",
    "precise measurement of relative positions of maser spots in the different maser transitions is essential for correctly deducing the pumping mechanism of sio masers .",
    "therefore , the registration technique of multiple sio maser line maps onto a common coordinate system is always an interesting issue and should be improved . in any technique ,",
    "accurate determination of the absolute coordinates of maser spots and accurate evaluation of the errors associated with instrumental factors ( e.g. , accuracy of vlbi station coordinates on the terrestrial reference frame ) are major factors to reduce the map registration uncertainty .",
    "straightforward measurement of maser spot positions with respect to extragalactic continuum sources ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) yields a 10 microarcsecond(@xmath11as)-level accuracy of the map registration .",
    "note that such a position - reference continuum source is often too faint to detect within a vlbi coherence time in the 40  ghz band ( @xmath122  min ) .",
    "therefore , a special technique for phase - referencing coherent integration is required @xcite .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we report new detections of sio @xmath0 @xmath1 maser emission towards two long - period variable stars : wx  piscium ( wx  psc ) and t  cephei ( t  cep ) and two repetitive detections of the @xmath0 masers towards r  leonis ( r  leo)(its first detection was reported by @xcite ) and w  hydrae ( w  hya ) in vlbi observations with the telescopes of nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) and the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) .",
    "the relatively high - sensitivity and short baselines including the nro 45  m telescope enabled us to detect the faint @xmath0 masers .",
    "we also report successful phase - referencing vlbi observations of sio @xmath2 and @xmath0 @xmath1 maser emissions associated with wx  psc and w  hya conducted with the vera telescopes in the dual - beam mode . with vera s baselines ( 10002300  km ) ,",
    "only compact unresolved maser spots are detectable , so it is difficult to analyze and discuss the difference in the maser distributions between the different transitions of sio masers . instead , the vera astrometry provides a good anchor of position reference for sio map registration as mentioned above . this _ letter _ focuses on technical points of vera astrometry for yielding a 10  @xmath11as - level accuracy of map registration and pays attention to providing a guideline for such astrometric observations in the 40  ghz band in which continuum source flux densities are usually lower than those in lower frequency bands and below a detection limit of @xmath9300  mjy with vera within vlbi coherence time .",

    "the @xmath0 maser was again detected toward w  hya ( with a pulsation period of @xmath14360  d ) three years after the first vlbi detection ( paper i ) .",
    "they are consistent with the suggestion that the @xmath0 maser should have strong correlation with the stellar light curve @xcite .",

    "the 1-@xmath15 noise levels of the images are 3.4 and 10.1  mjy  beam@xmath16 , respectively . the measured position offset of the continuum source ( in figure [ fig : continuums ] )",
    "is inversely equal to that of the phase - reference @xmath2 maser spot from the phase - tracking center of the maser source data ( columns 4 and 5 in table [ tab : sources ] ) .",
    "table [ tab : astrometry ] gives the determined coordinate offsets of the phase - reference @xmath2 maser spots . because the absolute coordinates of the reference sources are determined with an accuracy better than 0.5  mas ( e.g. @xcite ) , those of the reference maser spots are also determined in this level of accuracy .",
    "the position drift of the @xmath0 maser map with respect to the @xmath2 map appears proportionally to the position offset of the phase - reference maser spot and the frequency difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath0 masers ( @xcite ; paper i ) . using the derived position offsets mentioned above",
    ", this position drift was corrected for the @xmath0 maps . in the present vlbi observations ,",
    "the map registration of the @xmath2 and @xmath0 maser lines has an uncertainty less than 50  @xmath11as , small enough to discuss the maser pumping models .",
    "figure [ fig : masers ] shows the composite maps of sio @xmath2 and @xmath0 @xmath1 maser lines in wx  psc and w  hya .",
    "the maser emissions were significantly spatially resolved ; the cross - power flux densities of the @xmath2 and @xmath0 masers were much lower than the total - power flux densities ( @xmath9400 and @xmath950  jy in wx  psc and @xmath91000 and @xmath9350  jy in w  hya , respectively ) .",
    "comparing with those of previous observations ( e.g. , @xcite and paper i , respectively ) , only for unresolved , compact maser spots , we find that their relative positions have roughly persisted for a decade . assuming positions of the central stars at ( @xmath913 , @xmath95 ) and ( @xmath925 , @xmath930 ) [ mas ] for wx  psc and w  hya , respectively , the distance to the @xmath0 spots from the star is roughly equal to that of the @xmath2 spots , consistent with the previous observations ( paper i ; @xcite ) . as already mentioned , the @xmath0 and @xmath2 maser spots were not spatially coincident , in contrast to the results of paper i and @xcite . these results favor a collisional pumping scheme for sio masers ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "however , it is premature to draw ring - shaped distribution models in figure [ fig : masers ] and to discuss the correlation of the @xmath2 and @xmath0 emission distributions in the present results in which other fainter and more extended maser spots are missing . thus we can not rule out a scheme of line - overlapping between sio and 2o  ro - vibrational transitions , not only for @xmath2 @xmath1 @xcite but also @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite consider the most plausible overlap pair between the sio @xmath2",
    "@xmath17 @xmath0 @xmath18 and the 2o  @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 lines .",
    "this overlapping can excite the sio @xmath0 @xmath230 maser .",
    "temporal variation in spot displacement of different maser lines as predicted by @xcite can be examined by future monitoring observations with combination of high precision astrometry as those demonstrated in this paper and high dynamic imaging of the maser sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    here",
    "we emphasize that the present success in long - time coherent integration using the _ inverse _ phase - referencing technique is a milestone for vera astrometry using maser ",
    "continuum source pairs in the 40  ghz band . in the maser source astrometry with the very long baseline array ( vlba)(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) , sio maser sources have been often used as phase - reference because of their detections at signal - to - noise ratios higher than those of continuum sources . on the other hand , taking into account more complicated procedures of the inverse phase - referencing technique @xcite , a relatively high signal recording rate of vera has favored continuum sources as phase - reference .",
    "therefore , successful astrometric observations had been limited to nearly ideal cases in which both of maser and continuum sources should be bright enough to detect within a vlbi coherence time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a condition empirically demands flux densities higher than @xmath920  jy and 300  mjy for sio maser and 40  ghz continuum sources for vera astrometry , respectively .",
    "the present results prove that a 30  mjy - level continuum source is detectable with the _ inverse _ phase - referencing technique by using data of a bright sio maser source .",
    "this has advantage over the continuum - reference case in which even a bright , well - studied sio maser source was dropped out from the target list of vera astrometry because of the absence of bright continuum sources within 0.52.2  of the maser source for the vera dual - beam observations . as a result of the milestone achievement , a statistically moderate number ( @xmath2410 ) of well - studied sio",
    "maser sources harboring multiple transitions of sio masers , including @xmath0 @xmath1 , will become targets for the study on pumping mechanism of sio masers in vlbi and for the trigonometry with vera .",
    "moreover , in such a situation , we have to concern only about the dispersion of maser spot distributions , which is much larger than the uncertainty of relative positions among the different lines of sio masers .",
    "this is helpful for unambiguous interpretation of the pumping mechanism of the sio masers .",
