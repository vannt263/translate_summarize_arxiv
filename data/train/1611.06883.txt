    "nano - structures assembled on crystal surfaces through single - atom manipulation with a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) can serve as model systems for studying magnetism with atomic real - space resolution as well as excellent energy resolution .",
    "@xcite this technique can , for example , uncover spatial profiles of magnetic excitations in artificial one - dimensional spin chains @xcite .",
    "the surface not only supports the spin centres , but also plays a crucial role in stabilizing magnetic order @xcite .",
    "the impurities are coupled through exchange interactions of different physical origins , either direct exchange for nearest - neighbor adsorption sites or indirect substrate - mediated coupling that asymptotically decay as a power - law with increasing separation between the impurities ( ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida or rkky interaction ) @xcite .",
    "the indirect exchange coupling depends on the nature of the substrate states involved : in addition to bulk states , some commonly used noble metal substrates , such as cu(111 ) , also have a band of surface states crossing the fermi level @xcite .",
    "the existence of surface states in metals was first predicted in 1930s by i. tamm and w. shockley@xcite .",
    "originating from the atomic levels , it was shown how these states appear when the boundary of the crystal is formed .",
    "the momentum - resolved electronic structure on the surface of copper@xcite and other noble metals@xcite has been studied using angle - resolved photoemisson spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "more recently , the dispersion of surface states has also been studied in cu and ag using an stm@xcite .",
    "first principles and analytic calculations have predicted long - ranged oscillatory adsorbate - adsorbate interactions mediated by these surface states@xcite .",
    "their findings are consistent with a 2d rkky interaction that decays asymptotically as @xmath0 .    in the presence of both bulk and surface states ,",
    "as is commonly the case , the distance dependence of the exchange coupling at intermediate distances , which are also physically the most relevant , is non - trivial .",
    "moreover , at very short inter - impurity separation the atomistic details become important and lead to significant directional anisotropy . in addition , for strong impurity - substrate couplings the effective impurity - impurity exchange coupling can no longer be reliably determined through low - order perturbation theory estimates as in the simple rkky picture .",
    "this approach become particularly troublesome in situations where non - perturbative effects , such as the kondo screening @xcite , are also significant .",
    "for instance , in a recent study of fe atoms on cu(111 ) surface , their mutual interactions were measured with spin - resolved stm @xcite and the data was interpreted in terms of an ising model which does not include any many - body effects . in such cases , reliable non - perturbative techniques are required for an unbiased analysis .",
    "such methods , based on the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) group , have recently been developed @xcite .",
    "they allow one to study the full many - body problem with a realistic description of the band structure obtained from atomistic first principles calculations",
    ". the resulting tight - binding - model description of the substrate can be _ exactly _ mapped onto a 1d representation suitable for the dmrg calculations .",
    "this approach is numerically exact and correctly describes correlation effects and , in particular , the kondo singlet formation .",
    "many of the early stm experiments on single magnetic adsorbates exhibiting a kondo resonance were performed on the ( 111 ) surfaces of noble metals such as cu and ag that host surface - state bands @xcite .",
    "since both surface - state and bulk conduction band electrons hybridize with the adsorbate , the question of which one plays the dominant role has been widely debated @xcite .",
    "a number of experiments suggested a more important role of the bulk states in the formation of kondo state even on ( 111 ) surfaces @xcite : for example , the resonance width is not affected when the adatom is moved close to the step edges where the surface - state electron local density of states is modulated by a standing wave pattern @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum mirage experiments @xcite clearly demonstrate that the kondo resonance is projected from one focus to the other in an elliptical quantum corral , which necessarily involves the surface - state electrons .",
    "recently , kondo physics has also been explored on the si(111)-@xmath1ag substrate , which is a semiconductor with a metallic surface : a long decay length of the kondo resonance has been observed @xcite .    the usual treatment to derive an effective exchange interaction between the localized moments involves second - order perturbation theory .",
    "the result can be summarized as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is just the fourier transform of the non - interacting static susceptibility , or lindhard function . in this paper , we numerically study the adatom - adatom interactions on a surface with surface states non - perturbatively and with full real - space resolution .",
    "we consider quantum spins @xmath4 and we show important departures from the conventional perturbative rkky interpretation .",
    "in particular , long - ranged interactions are absent because of the formation of separate kondo - singlet states@xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section ii we introduce the model and methods , emphasizing on a new computational development that is introduced in this context for the first time .",
    "we describe our results in section iii , and we finally close with a discussion .",
    "unlike the boundary states in topological insulators , the shockley surface states are metallic and coexist near the fermi level with other bulk bands that are also partially filled .",
    "we begin our discussion with a three band tight binding model on a semi - infinite chain . we will then be able to extend the idea to an fcc lattice , where each site on the chain will become a triangular plane arranged to form an fcc lattice .",
    "the bands are described by hopping parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 as shown in fig .",
    "[ shockley_chain ] .",
    "this model will host a surface , or edge , state on the topmost @xmath7 sites .",
    "we follow the method described by pershoguba and yakovenko in ref .   to find the energy of this state by extending the treatment to a three - band problem .",
    "the hamiltonian for a translational invariant chain in momentum space can be represented by the matrix : @xmath8     and @xmath6 . ]",
    "one key feature of this hamiltonian that allows us to find an explicit expression for the surface state , is that the @xmath7 sites are not directly coupled to the @xmath9 sites .",
    "the schrodinger equation can be expressed as : @xmath10 where we introduce the spinor @xmath11 here @xmath12 labels the unit cell along the chain direction and the wave functions @xmath13 sit on sites @xmath7 , @xmath9 , or @xmath14 , which represent three orbitals of a copper atom that can originate from hybridizations of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 atomic orbitals @xcite . in this expression",
    "we use the matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 defined as : @xmath20 following ref .",
    ", we introduce the generating function @xmath21 that can be re - written as @xmath22^{-1}\\psi(1)~,\\ ] ] where we have used the boundary condition @xmath23    yakovenko _ et al._@xcite showed that for a given energy @xmath24 , a surface state exists if all poles of @xmath25 have magnitude greater than one . for our 1d chain , this state exists at @xmath26 , just as the two - orbital case , under the condition @xmath27 .",
    "also note that the surface state _ only _ exists on the @xmath7 sites .",
    "this same procedure can be generalized to a three - dimensional structure ( an fcc crystal in our case ) .",
    "the hoppings now acquire an in plane @xmath28 dependence .",
    "the in - plane hoppings are denoted as @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the bulk is now @xmath31 where , @xmath32 where the subindex @xmath33 can represent either one of the three orbitals @xmath7,@xmath9,@xmath14 .",
    "following the same reasoning as before for a chain , it can be found that the energy of the surface state is given by @xmath34 which is the same as the dispersion of the triangular lattice .",
    "the parameters in the model are adjusted to give a good description matching both first principles calculations and experiments .",
    "first , we fix @xmath35 and @xmath36 to fit the surface state energy at the @xmath37-point and its fermi momentum .",
    "this state has a binding energy of about @xmath38 and fermi vector @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the remaining parameters ( shown in table [ table ] ) are used to fit the bands near the fermi level along the @xmath40 line ( fig .",
    "[ bands_shockley ] ) .",
    "the theoretical data shown in fig .  [ bands_shockley ] is taken from ref  .. using this model , we obtain the correct surface band energy near the @xmath41 and @xmath37 points , we match the fermi momentum of the surface band , fit the bulk bands along @xmath40 near the fermi energy , all by preserving the symmetry of an fcc lattice .",
    "the resulting bands are shown in fig .",
    "[ bands_shockley ] as well as the local density of states in fig .",
    "[ shockley_dos ] .",
    "notice the local density of states ( ldos ) of the surface has a form very similar to that of a 2d triangular lattice with some contributions from the bulk bands , as expected .",
    ".model parameters ( in @xmath42 ) used in calculations throughout the paper .",
    "note that small changes in the parameters do not induce qualitative changes in the results . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      having obtained an accurate representation of the bulk and surface bands , we now introduce the magnetic atoms as two @xmath4 kondo impurities at positions @xmath43 and @xmath44 , connected to the surface through the many - body exchange interaction : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the kondo coupling constant .    in order to make the problem numerically tractable",
    ", we employ the so - called block lanczos method recently introduced in this context by two of the authors @xcite .",
    "this approach is inspired by wilson s original formulation of the numerical renormalization group @xcite , but accounting for the lattice structure .",
    "it enables one to study quantum impurity problems in real space and in arbitrary dimensions with the density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg)@xcite .",
    "this is done through a unitary transformation to a basis where the non - interacting band hamiltonian has block diagonal form .",
    "as described in detail in refs .  , this is equivalent to a block lanczos iteration , where the recursion is started from seed states corresponding to electrons sitting at the positions of the impurities .",
    "the resulting matrix that can be re - interpreted as a single - particle hamiltonian on a ladder geometry .",
    "the lanczos transformation is carried out by taking @xmath7 sites on the surface at the impurity positions to be the seed states .",
    "since we are considering impurities on the surface of a 3d system , a ladder of length @xmath37 will contain contributions from both surface and bulk states , with the large majority of these states having larger weight in the bulk . in order to reach the desired extremely large systems , we introduce an improvement to the afore mentioned method .",
    "it was shown that transforming from a ladder to a star geometry results in lower ground state entanglement than the ladder geometry@xcite , making it ideal for dmrg . a pictorial representation of the new geometry for the two impurity problem is shown in fig .  [ star ] .",
    "this mapping corresponds to a second unitary transformation on top of the ladder geometry .",
    "the seed states remain unchanged and are now coupled to the bath states with on - site energy @xmath47 via new hoppings @xmath48 .",
    "the new system is very advantageous since the surface states are very weakly coupled to the bulk states at high and low energies .",
    "we find that high energy states are either doubly occupied or empty and can be discarded without losing any physics .",
    "this allows us to carry out simulations in extremely large systems of the order of @xmath49 sites keeping of the order of 200 orbitals !",
    "we find that the results are absolutely free of finite size effects and therefore they represent the thermodynamic limit for all practical purposes . in all our simulations ,",
    "we use @xmath50 dmrg states , which yield results with machine precision accuracy in both energy and correlations .    .",
    "we first recall the expression for the lindhard function : @xmath51 where the sum is over the eigenstates @xmath52 with energies @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath54 are the single - particle states at positions @xmath55 .",
    "this function can be computed numerically for our systems , and compared to the non - perturbative results obtained by solving the many - body problem .",
    "results for spin - spin correlations as well as the perturbative result ( lindhard function ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ shockley_corr ] .",
    "we only display the @xmath56 component of the spin since the problem is @xmath57 symmetric .",
    "the particle number was adjusted to match the fermi level in copper . for the triangular lattice ,",
    "the filling is such that the fermi level is at the same point as the surface band , i.e. , we are in the low density regime .",
    "an interesting feature is that ferromagnetism is found on the shockley surface only at @xmath58 , consistent with the lindhard function as well as the result in ref .  . beyond @xmath58",
    "however , the kondo effect will dominate over ferromagnetism , where the perturbative results predict oscillations .",
    "in contrast , on the triangular lattice we find that all correlations are anti - ferromagnetic regardless of the value of @xmath46 . at weaker coupling , the impurities transition into a free moment regime attributed to the very low carrier density .",
    "when this occurs , our correlations acquire the value @xmath59 , the magnetic moments are completely decoupled from the conduction electrons and from each other , and the ground state is 4-fold degenerate with spins pointing in either direction . since we are enforcing spin conservation and @xmath60 ,",
    "the impurities are always anti - parallel and correlations can only assume the value @xmath61 .",
    "as the coupling is increased to @xmath62 , the spins form their own kondo clouds after a separation of just a few lattice spacings , signaled by zero correlations . in this regime ,",
    "both staggered and uniform magnetic susceptibilities are the same , and equal to the single impurity case .",
    "calculations were also conducted with increased filling on the triangular lattice , and our results are qualitatively the same , _",
    "i.e. _ , there is a competition between anti - ferromagnetism and kondo , with ferromagnetism completely absent .",
    "this is contrasting to the square lattice@xcite and graphene@xcite where some ferromagnetism is found at half filling , and is here due to the non - bipartite nature of the triangular lattice .",
    "there is a striking difference in the correlations on the shockley surface as a function of @xmath46 . at lower values of the coupling @xmath46 correlations for the shockley surface and the triangular lattice",
    "differ noticeably , but as the interaction is increased , they start resembling each other with the first one having a slight increase in the screening due to the contributions from the bulk states . not only is there an increase in kondo screening , but there is a significant change in the wavelength of oscillation .",
    "this change in wavelength is also seen in the lindhard function , but it is not as dramatic as the many - body case .",
    "we attribute these effects to the influence of the bulk .",
    "the periods of the oscillations are similar to the the periods of the lindhard function , except at short distances where the impurities are tending toward free moments .",
    "remarkably , at very short distances the correlations actually acquire the opposite sign ! for larger @xmath46 , and @xmath58 , the lindhard function correctly predicts the ferromagnetic interaction for the shockley case .",
    "this behavior is not seen in systems where there is only one band present at the fermi level .",
    "in addition to placing both impurities on the surface , calculations were done with one impurity in the bulk .",
    "it is found that correlations vanish after just one lattice space regardless of @xmath46 , indicating that the surface states do not leak into the bulk : the impurity at the surface will couple mainly to the surface states ( as indicated by the ldos in fig .",
    "[ shockley_dos ] ) , and the impurity in the bulk will couple to predominately bulk states since the surface states decay exponentially into the bulk . as a consequence , the impurities will remain uncorrelated .    in fig .",
    "[ t2t1 ] we show results obtained from different values of @xmath63 .",
    "the case @xmath64 corresponds to a completely decoupled surface , the triangular lattice .",
    "as @xmath65 is increased , the bulk contributes more and more to the physics .",
    "this can be seen as a change in the period of the oscillations and the sudden and dramatic change of sign of the correlations at distance @xmath58 .     for two spin @xmath4 impurities on the shockley surface with @xmath46=1.0 . ]",
    "we have investigated the role of surface and bulk states on the effective indirect exchange between two quantum impurities .",
    "the metallic surface was modeled by means of a tight - binding hamiltonian that reproduces the surface and bulk bands near the fermi surface , as obtained from first principles calculations .",
    "the quantum many - body problem was then solved numerically by means of the dmrg method after mapping the non - interacting degrees of freedom to a star geometry .",
    "this approach allows us to study the problem in the thermodynamic limit , with machine precision accuracy .",
    "most remarkably , ferromagnetism is completely absent , with the exception of impurities at distance @xmath58 , departing from the behavior observed in an isolated 2d triangular lattice .",
    "this effect clearly illustrates the subtle artifacts of perturbative approaches that are usually employed to guide experiments .",
    "we point out that at short distances it is very likely that direct exchange due to overlaping wave functions dominates the physics .",
    "we found that the correlations extend to just one atomic layer into the bulk , and the main contributions originate from surface states .",
    "however , our results indicate that the bulk states introduce a change in the period of the oscillations of the rkky interaction , and a non - trivial competition with kondo physics . the rkky interaction in these systems",
    "can not be completely described in terms of an isolated 2d surface as also observed experimentally for the case of a single impurity in the kondo regime @xcite .",
