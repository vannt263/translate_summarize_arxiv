    "quantum information processing ( qip ) aims to achieve the ultimate in computational power from physical systems by exploiting their quantum nature @xcite . nuclear magnetic resonance (",
    "nmr)-based qip has been successfully implemented in liquid - state ensemble systems of up to @xmath1 qubits @xcite .",
    "universal quantum control is achieved through application of external radio - frequency ( rf ) fields on or near resonance with spin transitions of a set of separately addressable , coupled spins .",
    "state initialization ( to a fiducial state such as @xmath2 ) is effectively achieved in these systems by the preparation of pseudopure states @xcite .",
    "pseudopure states have recently been demonstrated in a 12-qubit liquid system @xcite and in a 12-spin liquid - crystal system @xcite . a hallmark of control in liquid - state systems is a separation of timescales between ( faster ) qubit addressability and ( slower ) two - qubit coupling gates , typically by an order of magnitude or more @xcite .",
    "for the homonuclear subsystems , this corresponds to the weak - coupling regime , in which the relative zeeman shifts in the qubit hamiltonian are significantly larger than the _",
    "j_-couplings @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the evolution due to spin interactions is predominantly of the controlled - phase form . in this work ,",
    "we examine nmr - based qip implemented in a _ solid - state _ homonuclear system , in which the qubit hamiltonian is no longer in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "a solid - state nmr architecture is attractive due to several key properties @xcite : ( 1 ) nuclear spin states have been purified to near - unity polarizations in solids @xcite ; ( 2 ) intrinsic decoherence times can be much longer , and two - qubit gate times much shorter , than those in the liquid state ; ( 3 ) the qubit spins can be brought into well - controlled contact with a thermal - bath of bulk spins , enabling entropy - reducing operations such as algorithmic cooling @xcite and quantum error correction @xcite to be carried out .",
    "the system we will describe is specially tailored so that the ensemble description of the system is  to a good approximation ",
    "analogous to that of liquid - state nmr - qip , and therefore the general aspects of control and measurement are the same @xcite .",
    "a similar three qubit system using single - crystal glycine was first explored by leskowitz et .",
    "@xcite , in which the homonuclear two - carbon system was approximately weakly - coupled .",
    "however , we will demonstrate that universal , coherent control can be implemented in the strong - coupling regime : the regime in which the timescales of qubit addressing and qubit coupling are comparable . in this regime , the transverse spin operator terms from qubit - qubit dipolar couplings",
    "are less suppressed by the relative zeeman shifts .",
    "these residual flip - flop terms @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are pauli matrices ) render the state evolutions more complex , in general , than those of weakly - coupled spin systems .",
    "we show that strongly modulating pulses @xcite succeed in controlling the solid - state qip system , with generality and with high - fidelity .",
    "moreover , the pulses provide significant robustness for the desired transformations against the ensemble inhomogeneities that are typical of solid - state nmr systems .",
    "this latter property is of great importance to the practical application of quantum algorithms in such systems , and we present here a first step in its study .",
    "this control methodology is a key ingredient in the realization of solid - state nmr - qip testbed devices , but could also extend to many other potential systems for quantum information processing .",
    "we remark that liquid - crystalline nmr - qip implementations @xcite represent a coupling regime that is typically intermediate between the strong- and weak - coupling cases .",
    "strongly modulating pulses would therefore also be an appropriate means for controlling such systems universally .",
    "+ the secondary focus of this paper is to characterize , in detail , the employed three - qubit system based on the malonic acid molecule .",
    "this includes characterization of the dominant ensemble inhomogeneities arising both through linear and bi - linear terms in the hamiltonian . in tailoring the present system ,",
    "we have used dilution of the qubit molecules as a means for reaching an approximate ensemble description in which processor molecules are , ideally , non - interacting and reside in identical environments .",
    "however , the need for a macroscopic number of spins to generate observable nmr signals through the usual inductive detection both limits the degree of dilution and requires a macroscopic sample .",
    "the former results in perturbing intermolecular dipolar fields , and the latter typically yields significant distortions of the applied magnetic fields over the sample volume , namely , of the static magnetic field ( due to susceptibility / shape effects ) and of the rf amplitude ( due to the rf coil geometry ) . in this paper",
    ", we address the robustness of strongly modulating pulse control to dispersion of zeeman shifts and of rf amplitudes .",
    "we also characterize in detail the intermolecular dipolar environment in the present system , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : sec3 ] reviews strongly modulating rf pulses as a means of achieving universal quantum control , and numerical results for an example pulse are discussed ; in section  [ sec : sec2 ] , the dilute @xmath0c malonic acid system is first characterized ; section  [ sec : sec4 ] demonstrates the preparation of a pseudopure state ( as a benchmark for control ) and analyzes the results ; section  [ subsec : sec4c ] treats an application of the pseudopure state protocol : precise measurement of the triple - quantum dipolar dephasing rate , and comparison to single - quantum dephasing rates ; in section  [ sec : sec5 ] , simulated and experimental data are presented that explore the effect of intermolecular dipolar couplings on qubit coherence times ; in section  [ subsec : sec5b ] , a multiple - pulse refocusing sequence is used in order to compare appropriate experimental quantities with the intermolecular dipolar simulations , and as a first step in testing the attainability of long ensemble coherence times in this system ; the overall results are discussed in section  [ sec : sec6 ] , in the context of assessing the future goals and potential of solid - state nmr - qip .",
    "numerically optimized strongly modulating pulses were previously introduced as a means of implementing fast , high - fidelity unitary gate operations in the context of liquid - state nmr - qip @xcite .",
    "the aim is to construct an arbitrary modulated rf waveform that , when applied to the system , generates a desired effective hamiltonian corresponding to a particular quantum gate .",
    "this is accomplished numerically by minimizing the distance between the actual and the desired unitary transformations using a simplex search algorithm .",
    "gate fidelities are defined by the expression : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the dimension of the hilbert space , @xmath8 is the desired unitary and @xmath9 is the unitary calculated for the evolution of the system under the modulated rf pulse . here , @xmath10 is a normalized empirical distribution over an inhomogeneous parameter ( or parameters ) of the ensemble , typically the rf amplitude .",
    "the expression for @xmath11 corresponds to an average fidelity over all possible input states @xcite .",
    "the number of parameters the algorithm must search over is made minimal by requiring the modulating waveform to consist of a series of constant amplitude and frequency periods , so that each period has a time - independent hamiltonian in a particular rotating reference frame @xcite .",
    "modulation pulses with ideal ( simulated ) fidelities of order @xmath12 are readily found for liquid - state nmr - qip systems with up to 6 qubits @xcite .",
    "+ it is observed empirically that good modulating pulse solutions tend to have the average rf amplitude @xmath13 .",
    "the pulse is tailored to generate a three - qubit controlled-(not@xmath14not ) gate in the strongly - coupled malonic acid system to be described in the next section .",
    "the average rf amplitude is @xmath15 khz , whereas the magnitude of the internal @xmath0c hamiltonian ( parameters listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] , next section ) is @xmath16 khz .",
    "part ( c ) of the figure demonstrates the robustness of the calculated unitary over the dominant inhomogeneous hamiltonian parameters of the ensemble , namely , scaling of the rf amplitude and offset of the static field .",
    "this pulse was optimized over a 5-point probability distribution @xmath10 of rf amplitude scaling ( corresponding to that measured in our rf coil ) , centered on unity , with standard deviation @xmath17 .",
    "the fact that the unitary fidelity is @xmath18 over a @xmath19 khz range of static field offset demonstrates the ability of the modulated pulse to effectively refocus evolution under zeeman shift dispersion ( no zeeman distribution was used in the optimization ) .",
    "an ideal fidelity @xmath20 was obtained here , however , even greater precision is likely required for successful general implementation of quantum algorithms .",
    "we consider this a first step that can be significantly improved upon in future work .",
    "+ the strongly modulating pulse methodology generates fast pulses , relative to traditional selective pulse methods , to implement unitary gates .",
