    "femtocells have emerged as a solution to increase both the capacity and coverage while reducing both capital expenditures and operating expenses .",
    "femtocells , which consist of miniature personal base stations and stationary or low - mobility end users deployed in an indoor environment , are located within an existing cellular network ; a two - tier network is deployed .",
    "since femtocells operate in the licensed spectrum owned by wireless operators and share this spectrum with macrocell networks , limiting the cross - tier interference from femtocell users at a macrocell base station ( bs ) is an indispensable condition for deploying femtocells in the uplink . in addition , since a network operator can not control the femtocell locations , femtocells need to sense the radio environments around them and carry out self - configuration and self - optimization of radio resources from the moment they are set up in by the consumer @xcite .",
    "previous studies have developed cross - tier interference control methods by using transmit power control @xcite,@xcite and time hopping coupled with antenna sectoring @xcite for a two - tier cdma network .",
    "a signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) based power control scheme is shown to promote uplink performance , but does not consider the wall penetration loss @xcite . on the other hand , under the assumption that macrocell bs knows the positions of the overlaid users ,",
    "a power control scheme has been proposed to minimize the total transmitted power while satisfying the sir requirement and considering the wall penetration loss @xcite .",
    "the schemes in @xcite and @xcite have different effects on the uplink performances according to the underlying femtocell locations ; they require site - specific engineering in which the system parameters are manually tuned and optimized by technicians .",
    "therefore , these methods are not applicable to femtocells that should carry out the automatic self - configuration of radio resources .",
    "this paper proposes two interference mitigation strategies in which femtocell users adjust the maximum transmit power using an open - loop and a closed - loop technique . with the open - loop control ,",
    "a femtocell user adjusts the maximum transmit power to suppress the cross - tier interference due to the femtocell user , which results in the cross - tier interference less than a fixed interference threshold .",
    "the closed - loop control adjusts the maximum transmit power of the femtocell user to satisfy an adaptive interference threshold based on the level of noise and uplink interference ( ni ) at the macrocell bs .",
    "both schemes effectively compensate the uplink throughput degradation of the existing macrocell bs due to the cross - tier interference .",
    "furthermore , the use of the closed - loop control provides femtocell throughput that is superior to that using open - loop control at a very low macrocell throughput cost .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the two - tier cellular system model and basic power control method is described in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "section  [ sec : tpc ] is devoted to describing the proposed open - loop and closed - loop control schemes for the maximum transmit power of femtocell users . in section  [ sec : results ] , the simulation results are presented and discussed . finally , the conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "a two - tier cdma cellular network is considered here .",
    "a macrocell has a layout of two rings , 19 cells and single sector per cell . in - building",
    "femtocells are uniformly distributed in a macrocell .",
    "each femtocell bs is located within the center of the building and provides indoor wireless coverage to femtocell users .",
    "macrocell and femtocell users are uniformly distributed .",
    "the radio links between the bs and the users are divided into outdoor , indoor , and outdoor - to - indoor links according to the radio environment .",
    "the propagation loss @xmath0 caused by slow fading at the uplink is modeled based on an itu and cost231 path loss model @xcite@xcite :    * outdoor link ( macrocell user @xmath1 macrocell bs ) @xmath2 * outdoor - to - indoor link ( macrocell user @xmath1 femtocell bs , femtocell user @xmath1 macrocell bs ) @xmath3 * indoor link ( femtocell user @xmath1 femtocell bs ) @xmath4    here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the amount of transmitter - receiver separation in meter and the frequency in mhz , respectively .",
    "@xmath7 represents log - normal shadowing with a standard deviation of 8 db and a shadowing correlation of 0.5 in ( [ eq : plout ] ) and ( [ eq : ploutin ] ) , and that with a standard deviation of 10 db and a shadowing correlation of 0.7 db in ( [ eq : plin ] ) .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the external wall loss modeled as a gaussian distribution with a mean of 7 db and a standard deviation of 6 db .",
    "@xmath9 is internal wall loss given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is bernoulli random variable with success parameter @xmath12 .    in the conventional uplink open - loop power control ,",
    "the uplink path loss ( including shadowing ) between a user and a macrocell bs can be estimated by both the received downlink signal power measured at the user and the broadcast information on the effective isotropic radiated power ( eirp ) of the macrocell bs . with further knowledge of the required signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) of the current transmission and with broadcast information on the average power level of the noise and interference at the bs , the required uplink transmit power @xmath13 is derived as follows : @xmath14 here , @xmath0 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the uplink propagation loss , the required sinr for the current modulation and coding rate , and the estimated average power level of the noise and interference at the bs without considering the bs antenna gain , respectively .",
    "finally , the transmit power of the user @xmath17 is determined not to be in excess of the maximum transmit power @xmath18 , where the maximum transmit power @xmath18 can not be adaptively adjusted because it is the fixed value satisfying the spectrum emission mask and the error vector magnitude requirement .    in this paper ,",
    "the upper limit of transmit power @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is introduced to control the cross - tier interference caused by femtocell users , and the transmit power of the user is determined not to be in excess of @xmath19 as follows : @xmath21 the additional cross - tier interference at a macrocell bs due to femtocell users leads to a higher @xmath13 as shown in ( [ eq : ultxpw1 ] ) , which leads to a ni rise at the macrocell bs , which results in uplink throughput degradation in the macrocell .",
    "therefore , adjusting @xmath19 according to the cross - tier interference level can limit the ni rise and thus compensate for the uplink throughput degradation in the macrocell . in the following chapters ,",
    "the maximum transmit power is used for naming @xmath19 .",
    "in this section , an uplink power control scheme for femtocell users is proposed that adjusts the maximum transmit power @xmath19 as a function of the cross - tier interference level in an open - loop and closed - loop technique .",
    "[ sec : tpc ]      in the proposed open - loop control for @xmath19 , a femtocell user estimates its additional cross - tier interference to the macrocell bs and adjusts the maximum transmit power @xmath19 such that the additional cross - tier interference power is less than the predetermined maximum allowable interference level",
    ".    a femtocell user estimates the received signal powers from @xmath22 macrocell bss configured in its neighbor bs list @xmath23 , and evaluates the propagation losses @xmath24 from the macrocell bss as follows : @xmath25 where the eirp of the @xmath26th macrocell bs , @xmath27 is obtained by the broadcast information from the bss .",
    "the propagation losses @xmath28 can consider the path loss ( including shadowing ) in a frequency division duplexing ( fdd ) system by using the received signal powers @xmath23 averaged over time . in a time division duplexing ( tdd ) system , fast fading can be also considered in @xmath28 by using the instantaneous received signal powers @xmath23 due to the channel reciprocity between uplink and downlink .",
    "based on the symmetry between the uplink and downlink propagation losses , the @xmath29th macrocell bs with the minimum propagation loss @xmath30 is affected most by the cross - tier inference of the femtocell user .",
    "thus , the maximum cross - tier inference of the femtocell user to the @xmath29th macrocell bs , @xmath31 should satisfy the interference power constraint as follows : @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the transmit power of the femtocell user .",
    "@xmath34 is the maximum allowable cross - tier interference power at the @xmath29th macrocell bs .",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 denote the thermal noise spectral density , the bandwidth , and the noise figure of the macrocell bs , respectively , and the interference - to - noise ratio @xmath38 is a system - specific parameter known a priori to femtocell users .",
    "@xmath39 denotes the number of active femtocell users that decide the @xmath29th macrocell bs is affected most by their own interferences .",
    "using the value of @xmath29 reported from each femtocell user , each macrocell bs determines @xmath39 and broadcasts it to the femtocell users via the femtocell bss .",
    "the maximum transmit power of the femtocell user determined by an open - loop method , @xmath40 , is given by @xmath41 the transmit power of the femtocell user @xmath33 is determined by ( [ eq : ultxpw2 ] ) , in which @xmath19 is replaced by @xmath40 .",
    "this guarantees that the maximum cross - tier inference of the femtocell user does not exceed a the maximum allowable cross - tier interference power of each macrocell bs .",
    "since the actual ni level at each macrocell bs is not considered in the open - loop method , however , even when the ni level at each macrocell bs is sufficiently low , the maximum transmit power of femtocell users must be more limited than necessary .",
    "this degrades the uplink throughput in the femtocell .      in the proposed closed - loop control for @xmath19 ,",
    "a femtocell user adjusts the maximum transmit power @xmath19 as a function of not only the estimated additional cross - tier interference due to the femtocell user but also the ni level at the macrocell bs .",
    "before the closed - loop control procedure begins , a femtocell user obtains @xmath23 and @xmath42 and evaluates @xmath43 via ( [ eq : linkloss ] ) using the same method used in the open - loop control .",
    "additionally , the @xmath22 macrocell bss continuously monitor the uplink interference power from both macrocell users and femtocell users and broadcast the ni levels to the femtocell users via the femtocell bs that are wired to the macrocell bss .",
    "[ fig : algorithm ] shows the detailed closed - loop procedure used to update the maximum transmit power .",
    "for the initial step @xmath44 , before the femtocell user becomes active , the user obtains the initial ni level of the @xmath26th macrocell bs , @xmath45 including the uplink interference power from active users of macrocells and femtocells .    for @xmath46 , after the femtocell user becomes active , @xmath47 includes the additional cross - tier interference due to the femtocell user .",
    "this is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the transmit power of the active femtocell user and @xmath50 is the indoor - to - outdoor propagation loss from the femtocell user to the @xmath26th macrocell bs .",
    "the maximum allowable interference power of the @xmath26th macrocell bs , @xmath51 is determined as a function of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , as follows : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a system - specific parameter known a priori to femtocell users . if the ni level of the @xmath26th macrocell bs increases due to the additional cross - tier inference of a new active femtocell user , i.e. , @xmath56 , the maximum allowable interference power , @xmath51 , is determined on the basis of the ni level if there are no active femtocell users , @xmath45 .",
    "this decreases the transmit power of the femtocell user by lowering the maximum transmit power . on the other hand ,",
    "if the inference of active macrocell users decreases , the ni level of the @xmath26th macrocell bs decreases regardless of the additional cross - tier inference of a new active femtocell user , i.e. , @xmath57 . in this case",
    ", @xmath51 increases to be @xmath58 greater than @xmath59 , which increases the maximum transmit power and thus improves the uplink throughput in the femtocell .    the maximum transmit power of the femtocell user by the closed - loop method , @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the maximum allowable interference power of the @xmath63th macrocell bs with the minimum propagation loss @xmath64 .",
    "the transmit power of the femtocell user @xmath33 , which is determined using @xmath60 from ( [ eq : ultxpw2 ] ) , enhances the uplink throughput in the femtocell while bringing the total ni level of the macrocell bs under control .",

    "for fair comparison between the open - loop control and the closed - loop control for @xmath19 , the identical interference threshold of two schemes , i.e. , @xmath67 , is considered .",
    "this is achieved by @xmath68 . here ,",
    "@xmath38 is set to be 3 , and @xmath69 is -109 dbm .",
    "although an assumption of single femtocell per macrocell is not realistic , it provides insight regarding the proposed algorithms performance according to wall penetration loss and macro - to - femto distance . to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms , two performance metrics of the degradation ratio of macrocell throughput ( drmt ) @xmath70 and the achievement ratio of femtocell throughput ( arft ) @xmath71",

    "the drmt versus the distance between the macrocell bs and the femtocell bs , @xmath77 , for the fixed maximum power ( @xmath19 = 23 dbm ) , the closed - loop control , and the open - loop control schemes are compared in fig .",

    "are observed to perform consistently better compared to the fixed maximum power . additionally , the performance gain of the two proposed schemes over the fixed maximum power increases as @xmath77 and @xmath8 decrease .",
    "this is because the cross - tier interference at the macrocell bs caused by the fixed maximum power increases as @xmath77 and @xmath8 decrease , but those with the open - loop and the closed - loop control schemes are consistently below the threshold value , irrespective of the @xmath77 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is especially observed that both the open - loop and the closed - loop control schemes achieve a drmt of less then 0.05 regardless of the @xmath77 and @xmath8 .",
    "[ fig : at ] shows the arft of the open - loop and the closed - loop control schemes as a function of @xmath77 when @xmath8 = 1 and 10 db , and @xmath9 = 0 db .",
    "the closed - loop control scheme provides better arft than the open - loop control at the cost of the macrocell throughput for all of the considered cases .",
    "however , a close observation of fig .",
    "[ fig : lt ] shows that the degradation of the macrocell throughput with the closed - loop control is minimal compared to that of the open - loop control .",
    "the advantages of the closed - loop control over the open - loop control increase as @xmath77 and @xmath8 decrease , i.e. , as the cross - tier interference dominates the ni at the macrocell .      for performance evaluation under realistic conditions , fig .",
    "[ fig : sectortput ] shows the average sector throughputs of macrocell and femtocell as a function of the number of femtocell bss per macrocell , @xmath78 .",
    "increasing @xmath78 causes more severe cross - tier interference , and thus reduces the macrocell throughput .",
    "furthermore , the macrocell throughput gain of the two proposed schemes over the fixed maximum power increases as @xmath78 increase .",
    "this is because the cross - tier interference at the macrocell bs caused by the fixed maximum power scheme increases as @xmath78 decrease , but those with the open - loop and the closed - loop control schemes are consistently below the threshold value , irrespective of @xmath78 .",
    "[ fig : sectortput ] also shows that the throughput degradation of the femtocell is smaller than that of the macrocell for a large @xmath78 .",
    "this is resulted from the two factors : one is that femto - to - femto interference is smaller than the femto - to - macro cross - tier interference due to additional wall penetration loss , and the other is that the link loss between the femtocell user and the femtocell bs is smaller than that between the macrocell user and the macrocell bs .",
    "[ fig : edgetput ] depicts the 5% user throughput ( defined as the value of 5% of the cdf of user throughput ) as a function of @xmath78 . the 5% user throughput of macrocell , which represents the throughput of macrocell edge users , shows similar trend with the average throughput of macrocell depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sectortput ] because the cross - tier interference at a macrocell bs commonly affects all corresponding macrocell users .",
    "however , the 5% user throughput of femtocell shows different behavior compared with the average throughput of femtocell .",
    "especially , the gain of the closed - loop control over the open - loop control in terms of the 5% user throughput of femtocell is much larger than the gain in terms of the average throughput of femtocell .",
    "since the 5% user throughput of femtocell mostly represents the throughput of the users with low wall penetration loss and close to the macrocell bs , in these conditions , i.e. , in the cases of a small @xmath77 and @xmath8 , the transmit power of the femtocell user is limited by very small @xmath40 , and thus the use of @xmath60 leads to a higher transmit power of the femtocell user . on the other hand , for a large @xmath77 and @xmath8 ,",
    "the transmit power is hardly limited by @xmath40 , which is close to the maximum transmit power of 23 dbm , and thus an increase in the transmit power is minimal despite of the use of @xmath60 . consequently , the femtocell users with a small @xmath77 and @xmath8 are affected least by an increase of the interference from neighbor femtocells , which result in the higher throughput gain of the closed - loop control over the open - loop control .",
    "additionally , an increase in @xmath78 leads to a higher number of femtocell users near the macrocell bs , which results in an increase in the gain of the closed - loop control over the open - loop control in terms of the 5% user throughput of femtocell .",
    "[ fig : sectortput ] and [ fig : edgetput ] show that the femtocell throughput gains of the closed - loop control over the open - loop control are maximally 8% and 120% for the average throughput and the 5% user throughput , respectively . considering both the performance of macrocells and femtocells ,",
    "the closed - loop control is more effective in terms of 5% user throughput , while the open - loop control is good for the average throughput . on the other hand ,",
    "compared with the open - loop control , the closed - loop control additionally requires for femtocell users to know the ni level at the macrocell bs , which needs additional downlink overhead for broadcasting the ni level .",
