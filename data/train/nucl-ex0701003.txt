    "interest in the possibility of observing neutrinoless double beta decay ( 0@xmath42@xmath5 ) is considerable .",
    "if this decay were to be definitively observed , it would show that the neutrinos are their own antiparticles .",
    "in addition , the rate of the decay would be a measure of the neutrino rest mass , if the nuclear matrix element were known .",
    "unfortunately , theoretical calculations of this do not agree well with each other @xcite .",
    "it seems appropriate to determine additional properties of the ground states of the possible 0@xmath42@xmath5 systems by experiment , and thus help constrain and test theoretical calculations of this exotic decay mode .",
    "one of the likely candidate nuclei is @xmath0ge decaying to the ground state of @xmath0se .",
    "we have started with a study of the properties of the ground states of these nuclei , and especially the similarities and differences between them , using transfer reactions .",
    "one part of this study is an accurate measurement of one - nucleon transfer in order to probe the occupation numbers of valence orbits for both neutrons and protons , with particular attention to changes in these occupations .",
    "the other part is to study pair - correlations in these nuclei by nucleon pair transfer .",
    "here we report on a comparison of neutron pair transfer from the ( p , t ) reaction .",
    "we hope to obtain similar data on proton pair correlations from ( @xmath6he , n ) reactions in a future experiment .",
    "pair transfer between 0@xmath7 states in the ( p , t ) or ( t , p ) reaction proceeds via l=0 transfer and the angular distribution , for energies above the coulomb barrier , is sharply forward peaked .",
    "this feature was recognized early @xcite and was crucial in exploring the importance of such correlations and their excitations , the so - called pairing vibrations @xcite .",
    "the latter are an indication of deviations from the simplest pairing picture and can occur in regions of changing shapes , or when there is a gap in single - particle states , such as near a shell closure .",
    "we have carried out measurements of the neutron pair - removal ( p , t ) reaction on targets of @xmath8ge and @xmath9se .",
    "the reaction on @xmath3se was measured because the @xmath3se(p , t)@xmath0se leads to @xmath0se , while @xmath0se(p , t)@xmath2se starts from the ground state of @xmath0se .",
    "thus both reactions are relevant to the pairing structure of this ground state .",
    "the @xmath2ge target was included as a check .",
    "there are two relevant aspects to these measurements .",
    "the first is the matter of pairing vibrations .",
    "the even ge and se isotopes are well studied and evidence for excited 0@xmath7 states has been established @xcite . in some of the lighter isotopes of ge and se ,",
    "two - neutron transfer reactions have shown significant strength populating excited 0@xmath7 states .",
    "these pairing vibrations indicate that there are significant bcs - like pair correlations in connecting the target ground state in an even initial nucleus to excited 0@xmath7 states in the final .",
    "if there were significant differences in this regard between reactions leading to or from @xmath0ge and @xmath0se , this would be an indication that the pair correlations in the initial and final states in double - beta decay differ .",
    "any reliable calculations of the process would presumably have to reproduce such differences in order to obtain a reasonable matrix element for the 0@xmath42@xmath5 decay .",
    "secondly , if accurate cross sections were available for pair transfer further checks could be made of the similarity between the initial and final wave functions used in such calculations .",
    "given that the l=0 ( p , t ) transitions are the strongest in the spectrum of final states at very forward angles , which is also the region where the approximations inherent in the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) are best satisfied , it is desirable to carry out these measurements as close to 0@xmath1 as feasible .",
    "the ( p , t ) reaction had been studied previously on ge @xcite and se @xcite isotopes ; relevant ( t , p ) measurements have also been made @xcite .",
    "both the experimental methodology and the data analysis methods in the two ( p , t ) studies were different ( the target thickness was estimated from high - energy elastic scattering where optical model predictions are ambiguous , the angular distributions start at 7.5 degrees , and only angle - integrated cross sections are quoted , etc . ) , making a reliable systematic comparison of ge and se data difficult .",
    "our purpose here was to measure the cross sections at as far forward angles as feasible and to obtain a consistent set of accurate cross sections with particular care taken to reduce relative systematic uncertainties .",
    "the choice of energy was governed by the desirability of having both protons and tritons well above the coulomb barrier . for the present measurement we therefore chose 23-mev protons from the yale estu tandem van de graaf accelerator .",
    "this energy is similar to that used in earlier experiments , both for ( p , t ) and ( t , p ) reactions . because one of the objectives of the present measurement was to obtain accurate cross sections , we chose to measure the thickness of the evaporated germanium and selenium targets in situ by simply lowering the proton beam energy to 6 mev , where the elastic scattering cross sections are very close to rutherford values",
    ". the angle should not be so far forward that small uncertainties in angle would become significant and 30@xmath1 was chosen because calculations with several optical potentials showed that the deviation from rutherford scattering was less than 2% .",
    "the @xmath10ge and @xmath11se target thicknesses were found to range between 160 and 400 @xmath12g/@xmath13 .",
    "since se can sublimate at a relatively low temperature , this low - energy target thickness measurement was made at the beginning and then at the end of the experiment ; no significant differences ( @xmath143% ) were observed .",
    "the highest beam currents used were about 35 na , though considerably lower ( 2 - 3 na ) for the 3@xmath1 measurements .",
    "the yale enge split - pole spectrograph was used for the measurements with a focal - plane detector that cleanly separates tritons from other reaction products . as monitors ,",
    "two si surface barrier detectors at @xmath1532@xmath1 were used .",
    "they were calibrated in terms of beam intensity using a current integrator connected to a faraday cup .",
    "the beam integrator was set to the same scale that was used for the low - energy measurements and the solid - angle setting for the aperture of the spectrograph was also the same , thus establishing a relationship between an absolute cross section scale in terms of the monitor yields , instead of the beam intergrator , for each target .",
    "the 3@xmath1 setting for the spectrograph required that the faraday cup be retracted so that the beam - current measurement had to rely on the previously calibrated monitor counters .",
    "removal of the faraday cup meant that the beam entered the spectrometer .",
    "the magnetic rigidity of the tritons from the reaction is such that , with the magnetic field set for observing tritons , protons from the target can not directly reach the focal plane and are intercepted inside the spectrometer .",
    "protons scattered at this point can enter the focal plane and , whilst they can be distinguished from tritons by their ionization density , they do impose a counting rate limit . as a result , the furthest forward angle where measurements could be made was 3@xmath1 .",
    "distorted - wave calculations indicate that the cross section at this angle is lower than that at 0@xmath1 by about 8% .",
    "spectra were also measured at the laboratory angle of 22@xmath1 , which is close to the minimum for l=0 angular distributions , though the location and depth of the minimum is very sensitive to the q - value and the distorting parameters as is seen in figure  [ one ] . nevertheless , the ratio of the 3@xmath1 to the 22@xmath1 cross sections is huge compared to that for the other l values , and is therefore an excellent identifier of l=0 transitions , though the precise value of this ratio will depend on the exact location and depth of the sharp minimum in the angular distribution .",
    "representative spectra from the 3@xmath1 measurements are shown in figure   [ two ] where the ground - state transitions are clearly seen to dominate .",
    "the results of the cross - section measurements are shown in table  [ tone ] below , with ratios to the ground - state cross sections given only for states with yields , at 3@xmath1 , larger than 1% of the ground state yield .",
    "the transitions where the ratio of cross sections between 3@xmath1 and 22@xmath1 is consistent with l=0 are shown in bold .",
    "more complete data , though at further back angles and with less attention to accurate relative cross sections had been reported , but the emphasis in these previous measurements was on angular distributions starting at 7.5@xmath1 , and only angle - integrated cross sections are quoted @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the present experimental cross sections is believed to be @xmath1510% , while that in the relative values is estimated at @xmath155 % .",
    "these uncertainties are dominated by estimates of systematic errors ( constancy of the beam spot on target , accuracy of angle determinations in the monitors , possible small drifts in monitor calibration , possible inefficiency in the focal plane detector , uniformity of target thickness etc . ) while the statistical contribution is of the order of 1% .",
    "the ( p , t ) differential cross sections at 3@xmath1 for populating the 0@xmath7 ground states for the four targets are very similar : 6.4 , 6.7 , 6.0 , and 7.1 mb / sr for @xmath8ge and @xmath9se respectively .",
    "excited 0@xmath7 states stand out in the ratio between the 3@xmath1 and 22@xmath1 yields , which is an order of magnitude larger than for any other excited state . with the exception of the @xmath2ge target",
    ", none of these excited 0@xmath7 states is populated with a cross section at 3@xmath1 that is more than 2% of that leading to the ground states .",
    "in the @xmath2ge(p , t)@xmath16ge reaction the cross section to the first - excited 0@xmath7 state is 1.9 mb / sr .",
    "this feature is well known @xcite as an example of a pairing vibration .",
    "the case of @xmath2ge is illustrative of effects that can be problematic ; however the context of the current work is related only to the @xmath0ge/@xmath0se double - beta - decay system .",
    "the calculations were carried out with the dwba program ptolemy @xcite to correct the dependence of the reaction on q - values .",
    "the consideration of the details of nuclear structure is beyond the scope of this study , even though @xmath0ge and @xmath3se have 6 neutron vacancies in the n=50 shell , @xmath2ge and @xmath0se have 8 .",
    "the form factor for the neutron pair was calculated assuming a mass-2 , @xmath17 di - neutron bound in a woods - saxon potential with the appropriate binding energy and having 3 nodes in its wave function .",
    "the proton potentials were those of ref .",
    "@xcite and the triton potential that of ref .",
    "the measured cross sections at 3 degrees are given in table  [ ttwo ] together with the ratio of the experimental cross sections to the calculated values .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the dwba cross section is very sensitive to the choice of the distorting potentials as is the location of the first minimum in the angular distribution .",
    "however , all calculations indicate that the relative values between these targets of the calculated cross sections at 3@xmath1 remain the same ( within 10% ) with various reasonable potentials for protons and tritons . with the proton potential of ref .",
    "@xcite , the average ratio changes from 136 to 217 .",
    "the experimental cross sections by themselves are remarkably constant ; without any correction for reaction dynamics they vary by @xmath156% . dividing the experimental numbers by the calculated reaction cross sections , reduced the difference between @xmath0ge and @xmath0se even further .",
    "however , this improvement is probably not significant , in view of the estimated 5% relative error and the neglect of the different numbers of neutrons . the peak cross sections and dwba trends are also shown in figure  [ three ] .",
    "the pair - adding ( t , p ) reaction had been studied previously , for both the @xmath2ge(t , p)@xmath0ge @xcite and the @xmath0se(t , p)@xmath3se @xcite reactions",
    ". while the ground - state transitions are the same as the ones studied here , transitions to excited states could , in principle , show up and indicate pairing vibrations .",
    "while the angular distributions were not measured at as far forward angles as in the present work , some estimate can be obtained by comparing integral cross sections .",
    "no excited 0@xmath7 states were seen in these ( t , p ) studies with a strength greater than  4% of the ground - state transition , confirming the dominance of pair correlations in the ground states of these nuclei , with no splitting into pairing vibrations .",
    "the experimental cross sections measured in this experiment are remarkably constant for ground - state transitions with the various targets .",
    "the difference between @xmath0ge and @xmath0se , in the ratio of the experimental ground - state transition strengths divided by the appropriate dwba calculations , is less than the 5% estimated accuracy of the measurements .",
    "transitions to excited 0@xmath7 states from @xmath0ge and @xmath0se targets are no more than a few percent of the ground - state transitions indicating no sign of the pairing vibrations that appear in some of the lighter isotopes . had such admixtures been present , this would have complicated a simple comparison of the ground states .",
    "the constancy of the ground - state strength in pair correlations seems to be as true for neutron - pair - adding transfers leading to these nuclei as it is for pair removal from them .",
    "the present results suggest that the ground states of @xmath0ge and @xmath0se exhibit quantitatively very similar neutron pair - correlations .",
    "changes in pairing are thus unlikely to be a significant complicating factor in the wave functions of these states for calculations of neutrinoless double @xmath5 decay .",
