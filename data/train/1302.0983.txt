    "silicon is at the heart of all modern microelectronics .",
    "its properties have allowed the semiconductor industry to follow moore s law for nearly half a century , delivering nowadays billions of nanometre - scale transistors per chip . remarkably , silicon is also an ideal material to manipulate quantum information encoded in individual electron spins  @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the weak spin - orbit coupling and the existence of an abundant spin - zero isotope , which can be further enriched to obtain a `` semiconductor vacuum '' in which an electron spin can preserve a coherent quantum superposition state for exceptionally long times  @xcite .",
    "+ in order to define a robust spin-@xmath0/@xmath1 qubit hilbert space , it is necessary that the energy scale of the two - level system is well separated from higher excitations . in this respect , a major challenge for the use of silicon",
    "is represented by the multi - valley nature of its conduction band . in a bulk silicon crystal",
    "the conduction band minima are six - fold degenerate , but in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , the degeneracy is broken  @xcite into a two - fold degenerate ground state ( @xmath2 valleys ) and a four - fold degenerate excited state ( @xmath3 valleys ) , due to vertical confinement of electrons with different effective mass along the longitudinal and transverse directions , respectively . furthermore , the @xmath2 valley degeneracy is generally lifted by a sharp perpendicular potential  @xcite and the relevant energy separation is termed the valley splitting ( vs ) .",
    "+ the valley splitting depends on physics at the atomic scale  @xcite ( e.g. roughness , alloy and interface disorder ) , and so it is not surprising that experiments have revealed a large variability of splittings among devices , ranging from hundreds of @xmath4ev  @xcite up to tens of mev in exceptional cases  @xcite . at present , the lack of a reliable experimental strategy to achieve control over the vs is driving an intense research effort for the development of devices that can assure robust electron spin qubits by minimising multi - valley detrimental effects  @xcite , or even exploit the valley degree of freedom  @xcite for new types of qubits .",
    "+ another crucial parameter to assess the suitability of a physical system to encode spin - based qubits is the relaxation time of spin excited states ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "spin lifetimes have been measured for gate - defined si quantum dots ( qds )  @xcite , si / sige qds  @xcite and donors in si  @xcite , reporting values which span from a few milliseconds to a few seconds .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of the spin relaxation rate ( @xmath6 ) on an externally - applied magnetic field ( @xmath7 ) has been investigated .",
    "different mechanisms apply to donors and qds , accounting for observed @xmath8 and @xmath9 dependencies  @xcite , respectively . in principle",
    ", @xmath10 depends on the valley configuration and the details of the excited states above the spin ground state .",
    "however , until now , no experimental observation of the effects of a variable vs on the relaxation rate has been reported .",
    "+ here , we demonstrate for the first time that the valley splitting in a silicon qd can be finely tuned by direct control of an electrostatic gate potential .",
    "we find that the dependence of the vs on vertical electric field at the si / sio@xmath1 interface is strikingly linear , and show that its tunability is in excellent agreement with atomistic tight - binding predictions .",
    "we demonstrate accurate control of the vs over a range of about 500 @xmath4ev and use it to explore the physics of spin relaxation for different qd occupancies ( @xmath11=1 , 2 , 3 ) .",
    "we probe both the regime where the vs is much larger than the zeeman splitting at all magnetic fields and that where the valley and spin splittings are comparable . we observe a dramatic enhancement of the spin decay rate ( relaxation hot - spot ) when spin and valley splittings coincide . to our knowledge , such hot - spots",
    "have been predicted for relaxation involving orbital states  @xcite ( not valley states ) , but these are yet to be observed .",
    "we develop an analytic theory that explains the @xmath7-field dependence of the relaxation rates and the details of the relaxation hot - spot in terms of admixing of spin - valley states .",

    "[ device](a)-(d ) .",
    "a quantum dot is formed under gate p by applying a positive bias voltage to induce an electron accumulation layer .",
    "strong planar confinement for the dot s potential well is achieved by negatively biasing gates b , c1 and c2 .",
    "a 2deg reservoir is also induced by positively biasing gates r1 and r2 , and the qd occupancy can be modified by inducing electrons to tunnel between this reservoir and the dot .",
    "the remaining gates , namely sb1 , sb2 , st , are employed to define a single - electron transistor ( set ) , capacitively coupled to the qd and used as a read - out device .",
    "the high flexibility of our design would allow us to use the same device also as a ( single - lead ) double dot structure by rearranging the gate bias ( e.g. dots can be formed under gates b and c2 ) .",
    "however , in this work , we only present results relevant to the single - dot configuration .",
    "+ in order to characterize the addition spectrum of the qd , we make use of a technique previously developed for gaas - based systems which combines charge detection and gate pulsing  @xcite . there is no direct transport through the single - lead qd and , therefore , addition / removal of charge is only detected via modifications in the set current . in particular , charge transitions are detected as current peaks in the set signal whenever the qd energy eigenstates come into resonance with the reservoir s fermi level .",
    "note that the set - qd coupling is merely capacitive ( via @xmath12 ) and electrons do not tunnel between them . in order to maximize charge sensitivity in the detector ,",
    "we employ dynamic voltage compensation  @xcite on different gates which makes our read - out signal virtually unaffected by slow charge drifts and random charge rearrangements .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the charge stability measurements can be found in the supplementary note 1 .",

    "there is very little variation of charging energy ( @xmath16 ) for high occupancies ( @xmath17  11 mev for @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , by decreasing the electron number , the charging energy steadily increases , as expected when the dot size is significantly affected by the electron number .",
    "this evidently indicates that the few - electron regime has been achieved .",
    "most interestingly , the energy spectrum shows peaks for the addition of the 5th and 13th electrons .",
    "the extra addition energy needed for those transitions can be attributed to complete filling of the first and second orbital shells . as illustrated in fig .",
    "1(f ) , this is consistent with the energy spectrum of two - valley 2d fock - darwin states  @xcite , where the first and second orbital shells hold 4 and 8 electrons respectively .",
    "this confirms that we can probe the occupancy until the last electron . to our knowledge ,",
    "such a clear manifestation of two - dimensional shell structure has been observed before only in ingaas dots  @xcite and in si / sige dots  @xcite .          in order to measure the spin state of individual electrons in the qd",
    ", we use an energy - selective readout technique  @xcite .",
    "the readout protocol consists of three phases clocked by a three - level pulsed voltage applied to gate p , which directly controls the dot s electrochemical potential [ see fig .",
    "[ t1vsb ] ( a ) ] .",
    "firstly , an electron of unknown spin is loaded into the dot causing a sudden decrease in the sensor current .",
    "next , the potential of the dot is lifted so that the fermi level of the reservoir lies between the spin - up and spin - down states of the dot , meaning that a spin - up electron can tunnel off the dot while a spin - down electron is blocked .",
    "this is the read phase , during which the presence of a spin - up state would be signalled by a current transient ( spin - up tunnels out and then spin - down tunnels in ) whereas a spin - down electron would lead to no current modification .",
    "finally , the dot s potential is further lifted to allow the electron to tunnel off , regardless of its spin orientation . in fig .",
    "[ t1vsb ] ( b ) single - shot traces for both spin - up ( in blue ) and spin - down ( in green ) detection are plotted .",
    "the longer the system is held in the load phase before performing a read operation , the more likely it is for the spin - up excited state to decay to the spin - down ground state .",
    "thus , by varying the length of the load phase and monitoring the probability of detecting a spin - up electron , we can determine  @xcite the spin lifetime , @xmath5 . in our experiments",
    "the @xmath7-field is directed along the [ 110 ] crystallographic axis .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of both the spin - up fraction measurements and the fitting procedure to evaluate @xmath5 is included in the supplementary note 2 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ t1vsb ] ( d ) , we observe a wide range of spin lifetimes as a function of magnetic field , with lifetimes as long as 2.6s at the lowest fields studied , @xmath7=1.25 t .",
    "these are some of the longest lifetimes observed to date in silicon quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "+ a key focus of our experiment was to electrostatically tune the valley energy separation and measure relaxation rates in different valley configurations and qd electron occupancies .",
    "_ as we show below , our data definitively indicate that excited valley states play a critical role in the spin relaxation processes .",
    "_ we develop a theory to explain how changes in the valley splitting affects the spin - valley state mixing and leads to the observed relaxation times .",

    "when @xmath28  ( i.e. for @xmath7=2.8 t ) , a spike in the relaxation rate occurs .",
    "relaxation hot - spots have been previously predicted to occur for spin relaxation involving orbital states in single and coupled qds  @xcite._to our knowledge , this is the first experimental observation of such a phenomenon .",
    "_ + in order to understand the relaxation mechanisms , we have developed a model that takes into account the perturbations in pure spin states due to spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , yielding eigenstates which are admixtures of spin and valley states .",

    "the prominent mechanism is the spin - valley admixing , which we now discuss in detail .",
    "+        the relaxation between pure spin states is forbidden because the electron - phonon interaction does not involve spin flipping . however , in the presence of interface disorder , soc can mix states that contain both the valley and spin degrees of freedom , thus permitting phonon - induced relaxation . indeed , in the non - ideal case of qds with a disordered interface , roughness can perturb the envelope function of both valleys ( otherwise identical for ideal interfaces ) and allows one to assume non - zero dipole matrix elements connecting the valley states ( see supplementary note 3 ) , such as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( for ideal interfaces these are non - zero only due to a strongly suppressed umklapp process ) . by means of perturbation theory , we define renormalized excited states @xmath37 and @xmath38 that can relax to the ground state @xmath39 , as they have an admixture of the state @xmath40 of the same spin projection [ see fig .

    "+ the good agreement between the calculations and experiment , as well as the presence of a hot - spot at the point of degeneracy between zeeman and valley splitting , provide strong evidence of our ansatz that the spin relaxation is predominantly due to a _ new mechanism _ : that of mixing with the excited valley states via rashba / dresselhaus - like soc in the presence of interface disorder .",
    "+ both the splitting at the anticrossing , eq.([delta_a - b-(110 ) ] ) , and the intervalley relaxation , eq.([valley - relax - gam0 ] ) , depend crucially on the size of the dipole matrix element , @xmath75 , predicting a fast phonon relaxation of @xmath76 for @xmath77 , at the hot - spot of fig .",

    "the occurrence of this minimum does not strictly depend on the nature of the states involved in the decay ( spin - like , valley - like , orbital - like or admixtures ) .",

    "[ @xcite ] , in small qds for higher occupancies a significantly reduced energy separation between the ground state and the first excited orbital state is observed . this would introduce a non - negligible perturbation on the relaxation if this were affected by the orbital degree of freedom . hence , the similarities in behaviour in terms of decay rates are a further indication that for our qd the dominant relaxation mechanism resides in the degree of spin - valley admixing , as opposed to the spin - orbit admixing relevant for other semiconductor systems  @xcite .",

    "<S> although silicon is a promising material for quantum computation , the degeneracy of the conduction band minima ( valleys ) must be lifted with a splitting sufficient to ensure formation of well - defined and long - lived spin qubits . </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate that valley separation can be accurately tuned via electrostatic gate control in a metal - oxide - semiconductor quantum dot , providing splittings spanning 0.3 - 0.8 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting varies linearly with applied electric field , with a ratio in agreement with atomistic tight - binding predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate single - shot spin readout and measure the spin relaxation for different valley configurations and dot occupancies , finding one - electron lifetimes exceeding 2 seconds . </S>",
    "<S> spin relaxation occurs via phonon emission due to spin - orbit coupling between the valley states , a process not previously anticipated for silicon quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> an analytical theory describes the magnetic field dependence of the relaxation rate , including the presence of a dramatic rate enhancement ( or hot - spot ) when zeeman and valley splittings coincide . </S>"
