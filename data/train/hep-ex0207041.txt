    "the branching fractions for @xmath34 decays with @xmath10 creation are measured to be @xcite .",

    "although rather precise measurements of the cross sections exist for the processes @xmath124 @xcite and @xmath125 @xcite , the final states observed in @xmath121 annihilation are a mixture of isovector and isoscalar contributions and their separation requires a complicated model - dependent analysis .",

    "the observed behavior can be interpreted as production of an intermediate @xmath24 resonance that then decays to @xmath17 .",
    "a clear signal is also found in the @xmath102 decay mode .",
    "the @xmath19 mass spectrum for this signal is also peaked near the @xmath19 mass threshold .",
    "the angular dependence shows a cos@xmath130 behavior indicating that the @xmath19 system has j@xmath13=1@xmath109 .",
    "some enhancements in the signal regions are also seen in the @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 decay modes , but with limited statistical significance . a non - resonant three - body contribution , which is not described by phase space , can not easily be ruled out for any of these decay modes .",
