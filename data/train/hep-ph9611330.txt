    "<S> we estimate the production cross section for @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons via pomeron - pomeron fusion in peripheral heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> total and elastic @xmath2 cross sections are calculated in an equivalent pomeron approximation .    in a recent paper @xcite , we discussed the production of the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath0 and @xmath1 in peripheral collisions of high - energy heavy ions . applying an equivalent photon approximation to the large virtual photon luminosities accompanying the colliding nuclei , we calculated production cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath1 via @xmath3 fusion . for the large center - of - mass beam energies available at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven ( 100 gev / nucleon ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern ( 3.5 tev / nucleon ) </S>",
    "<S> , we found the @xmath3 elastic cross sections for the @xmath0 to be about 0.8 mb at the lhc and 9 @xmath4b at rhic ; the cross sections for the heavier @xmath1 were on the order of @xmath5b and 0.2 nb , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> there are backgrounds to this process which need to be considered , such as strong double diffractive scattering , i.e. , double pomeron exchange . </S>",
    "<S> these competing contributions are the subject of this work . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we use the effective pomeron approximation developed earlier @xcite to calculate the pomeron - pomeron cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath1 production . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the detection of such processes requires the low background attendant in peripheral ion collisions ; to this end , we calculate both the impact parameter dependence and the effects of nuclear absorption , complementing work of natale @xcite .    the equivalent pomeron approximation @xcite is a generalization of the standard equivalent photon approximation @xcite , in which one replaces the electromagnetic field of a relativistic charged particle with an equivalent pulse of real photons . for a pomeron , </S>",
    "<S> one begins with the regge trajectory @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 gev@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this trajectory has an intercept close to 1 , suggesting that the pomeron behaves like a spin - one boson in processes in which the exchanged four - momentum squared @xmath10 is small . </S>",
    "<S> pomeron exchange can thus be described to be like that of an isoscalar `` photon '' , with propagator at high c.m . </S>",
    "<S> energy given by @xcite , @xmath11 is the pomeron range parameter @xcite , @xmath12 following donnachie and landshoff @xcite , we denote the nucleon - pomeron coupling by @xmath13 where the quark - pomeron coupling @xmath14 is @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the isoscalar magnetic nucleon form factor . for nucleus - pomeron interaction , </S>",
    "<S> we appeal to the additivity of the total nucleon - nucleon cross sections and replace @xmath14 by @xmath17 and @xmath16 by the elastic nuclear form factor @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath19pb nuclei , and approximate the form factor by the gaussian @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 mev .    in the spirit of the equivalent photon approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we write the cross section for @xmath2 fusion arising from the interaction of ion beams @xmath22 and @xmath23 with center of mass energy @xmath24 in the form ( see figure 1 ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the distribution function for finding a pomeron in the nucleus with energy fraction @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this was worked out in reference @xcite ; for a nucleus of mass @xmath28 and nucleon number @xmath22 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the invariant subprocess with which the pomeron participates . in this expression , @xmath31 is the production cross section for the subprocess @xmath32 with squared center of mass energy @xmath33 @xcite , @xmath34 relying on the `` pomeron as isoscalar photon '' identification , the partial two - pomeron decay width @xmath35 is determined from the corresponding two - photon width by replacing the photon coupling @xmath36 with the pomeron coupling @xmath37 , where 3 is the color factor . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a pointlike quark - pomeron coupling does not account for the necessary decrease in the coupling when one of the quarks is off mass shell . </S>",
    "<S> we thus modulate @xmath14 as @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 gev , and @xmath40 measures </S>",
    "<S> how far one of the quark legs is off mass shell . strictly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath41 is an integration variable at the quark - pomeron vertices in figure 1 ; we will simply assume @xmath42 and use the substitution @xmath43 for the quark - pomeron coupling . with these choices , the integral in equation ( 7 ) </S>",
    "<S> can be performed analytically , giving @xmath44    in calculating the impact parameter dependence of the cross section , we write the total @xmath2 exchange cross section ( 7 ) in the impact parameter representation and fold it with the probability that no inelastic interaction takes place other than double pomeron exchange . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the cross section on the impact parameter @xmath45 is then found by integrating the squared matrix element over all spacetime coordinates save for the transverse distance @xmath45 between nuclei @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> accounting for the pseudoscalar nature of the @xmath46 mesons as discussed in reference @xcite , we find @xmath47 @xmath48 with @xmath49 where we introduce the quantities @xmath50 and @xmath51 , given by equation ( 3 ) , is defined for the invariant subprocess with which the pomeron participates , i.e. , @xmath52 for the pomeron emitted by nucleus 1 , @xmath53 for the pomeron emitted by nucleus 2 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath54 has dimension ( energy)@xmath55 , which compensates the `` incorrect '' dimensionality of @xmath56 in equation ( 8) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the @xmath27 integrals in ( 13 ) is easily done , courtesy of the @xmath57 function in equation ( 9 ) ; the other can be performed numerically .    </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the total production cross section @xmath58 and the differential cross section @xmath59 for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in the collision of @xmath19pb nuclei at both lhc and rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath60 kev and @xmath61 kev @xcite , our calculations yield a total cross section of @xmath62 mb and @xmath63 nb at lhc energy ; at rhic , the numbers are understandably lower : @xmath64b and @xmath65 pb , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> these cross sections , of course , are overly optimistic in that they do not account for the effects of inelastic nuclear scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of the inelastic events are expected to occur at small values of the impact parameter @xmath45 ; indeed , the elastic nature of the interaction is maintained only in those collisions in which the two nuclei pass by each other . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is important to verify that a significant portion of the @xmath2 cross section extends out to measurably large impact parameters . as in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we have included inelastic scattering effects in two different ways . </S>",
    "<S> one is by applying a geometric cutoff at a minimum impact parameter of @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the nuclear radius ( @xmath68 fm for @xmath19pb ) . </S>",
    "<S> a more realistic approach accounts for inelastic scattering effects using the glauber approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results for both absorption methods are presented in table 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the differential cross sections on impact parameter is compared with our earlier results for @xmath3 fusion in figures 2 and 3 , where the dotted curves show the effects of absorption in the glauber approximation . for @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that although both production modes are of roughly the same order of magnitude at @xmath69 , the pomeron contribution is more strongly suppressed because the probability for an elastic collision becomes large only for @xmath70 fm . for @xmath1 production , however , we find that the smallness of the @xmath2 cross section largely derives from the reduction @xmath71 at the quark - pomeron vertex , indicating the difficulty of localizing pomerons within a region of high inverse mass . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , this effect makes sense : the pomeron is an effective description of a virtual two gluon state , and as such has an intrinsic spatial extent on the order of 1 gev@xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be less likely to find such a structure concentrated within the smaller limit @xmath73gev@xmath74 .    </S>",
