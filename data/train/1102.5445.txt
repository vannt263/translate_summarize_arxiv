    "our solar system is moving though the circum - heliospheric interstellar medium ( chism ) .",
    "the solar wind interacts with interstellar plasma and complex structure of the interaction region is formed due to relative sun / chism motion ( see fig.[interface - sc ]  a ) .",
    "chism is a weakly ( 20 - 30  % ) ionized plasma and mainly consists of hydrogen .",
    "the mean free path of the interstellar hydrogen atoms ( h atoms ) is larger or comparable with the characteristic distance of the sw / chism interaction region .",
    "therefore , h atoms penetrate deeply to the heliosphere , where properties of h atom component can be measured directly on indirectly .",
    "due to their large mean free path in the heliosphere a kinetic approach should be used to describe h atom component theoretically .",
    "the first self - consistent kinetic - gasdynamical model of the sw / chism interaction has been developed by @xcite ( baranov - malama model hereafter ) .",
    "it was shown that the sw / chism interaction region ( that is often called in literature as the heliospheric interface ) consists of four regions with different plasma properties .",
    "these regions are separated by three discontinuity surfaces , namely , the termination shock and bow shock are boundaries of the supersonic solar wind and interstellar medium flows , accordingly , and the heliopause is a tangential surface separated charged components of the two plasma flows .",
    "is the axis of symmetry directed toward the upwind direction , @xmath5 is an axis in cylindrical coordinate system that is perpendicular to the upwind direction ; curve  1 is the outer boundary in our model ; curve  2 is a schematic representation of the heliospheric termination shock . ]",
    "one of the results obtained by @xcite and previously by @xcite is the hydrogen wall that was discovered experimentally by @xcite ( see also wood et al .",
    ", 2007a , 2007b for recent developments ) .",
    "the hydrogen wall is an increase of h atom density in the vicinity of the heliopause due to production of newly created h atoms by charge exchange .",
    "these secondary atoms have properties of plasma in the vicinity of the heliopause .",
    "the interstellar plasma in the vicinity of the heliopause is heated and decelerated , and , therefore , the mean velocity of the secondary h atom population is smaller and the temperature is larger as compared with the velocity and temperature of the original ( or primary ) h atom population that consists of interstellar atoms , which entering into the heliopshere without being charge exchanged in the heliospheric interface .",
    "a mixture of the primary and secondary interstellar h atom populations penetrate to the heliosphere . inside the heliosphere in region between the heliopause and the termination shock ( this region",
    "is often called as the inner heliosheath ) new atoms are also created during charge - exchange . these atoms are called as the energetic neutral atoms ( enas ) and now they are measured by interstellar boundary explorer spacecraft @xcite .",
    "enas have a small number density in the heliosphere as compared with interstellar atoms , that is why enas are not important for backscattered ly-@xmath0 radiation .",
    "it was recognized since 1970s that the solar ly-@xmath0 photons are effectively backscattered by the interstellar h atoms .",
    "spectral properties of the backscattered ly-@xmath0 radiation depend on the velocity and spatial distribution of the interstellar hydrogen inside the heliosphere . since the distribution of h atoms is disturbed in the heliospheric interface , then the backscattered ly-@xmath0 may , in principle , serve as the source of information on the heliospheric interface structure . for example , @xcite analyzed soho / swan data and showed that the temperature of the interstellar hydrogen at large distances from the sun ( at 50 au where local effects of solar gravitation , radiation and ionization are negligible ) is significantly higher then temperature of the chism .",
    "the bulk velocity of the hydrogen flow obtained by this analysis is about 21 km / s that is @xmath25 km / s smaller than the relative sw / chism velocity .",
    "these differences in the properties of the hydrogen gas as compared with the properties of the chism are explained by existence of the secondary interstellar h atom population in the heliopshere .",
    "the effect of the heliospheric interface is also seen in the measured @xcite deflection of the interstellar h atom flow direction as compared with the direction of the interstellar helium .",
    "in contrast to the hydrogen the charge - exchange cross - section of helium ( @xmath6 ) is small , that is why it is usually assumed that the interstellar helium stay practically undisturbed during its motion from chism to the heliosphere .",
    "it means that the velocity vector of the helium flow in the vicinity of the sun refers to the value and to direction of the interstellar gas flow . in turn ,",
    "hydrogen atom flow is affected by charge - exchange with protons in the sw / chism interaction region .",
    "the deflection of hydrogen atoms inside the heliosphere from the direction of sw / chism relative motion is most probably due to distortion of the global heliospheric interface structure caused by the interstellar magnetic field that leads to asymmetry of interstellar plasma flow in the heliospheric interface and this asymmetry transfers to h atoms through the charge - exchange .",
    "this fact opened a possibility to estimate magnitude and direction of the interstellar magnetic field ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another manifestation of the heliospheric interface was found during analyzes of the second moment of the backscattered ly-@xmath0 radiation spectra .",
    "this moment corresponds to the width of the spectra and depends on the width of the h atom velocity distribution .",
    "being expressed in the units of temperature the line - width is often called as the line - of - sight ( or l - o - s ) temperature . @xcite and @xcite derived the l - o - s temperature of the backscattered ly-@xmath0 from soho / swan data and presented the temperature as a function of the angle @xmath7 between the line - of - sight direction and the direction toward the chism flow ( i.e. the upwind direction ) .",
    "it was shown that the temperature in the directions of @xmath7 = 50 - 60@xmath1 is smaller by 1500 - 2000  k than the temperature toward upwind .",
    "this minimum was explained by @xcite and @xcite qualitatively by presence of the primary and secondary populations of the interstellar hydrogen atoms .",
    "the goal of this study is to theoretically explore the imprints of the heliospheric interface on spectral properties of the backscattered ly-@xmath0 radiation and separate these effects from the local effects ( i.e. the effects that act within 10 - 20 au of the sun ) of the solar ionization , charge exchange , solar gravitation and radiation pressure .",
    "we have computed line profiles and their moments of the backscattered ly-@xmath0 spectra based on newly developed advanced kinetic model of the hydrogen distribution in the heliosphere ( katushkina & izmodenov , 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "this model combines comparative simplicity of the classical hot model with ability to account for both the perturbations of the hydrogen distribution function in the sw / chism interaction region ( later it will be mentioned as effects of the heliospheric interface ) and local effects which are significant only in the vicinity of the sun . in order to separate the heliospheric boundary effects from the local effects we compare new model results with the results of the simplified hot models , which describe local effects in similar way as the advanced model , but do not take into account the effects of the heliospheric boundaries",
    "to model spatial and velocity distribution of the interstellar hydrogen in the heliosphere we solve a kinetic equation ( see , e.g. katushkina & izmodenov , 2010 ) for the distribution function @xmath8 of the hydrogen atoms inside the sphere with radius of 90 au around the sun ( see fig .",
    "[ interface - sc ]  b ) .",
    "the processes of the photoionization , charge - exchange , solar gravitation and solar radiation pressure are taken into account .",
    "it is assumed in the model that the rates of charge exchange @xmath9 and photoionization @xmath10 decrease with distance from the sun as @xmath11 .",
    "we use following values of ionization rates at the earth orbit : @xmath12 s@xmath13 , @xmath14 s@xmath15 . to calculate the charge - exchange rate at the earth orbit we use averaged values of the solar wind number density ( 6  @xmath16 ) and velocity ( 440  km / s ) known from measurements , and charge - exchange cross - section from @xcite . the solar gravitational force and the force of the radiation pressure act in opposite directions and both are proportional to @xmath11 , where @xmath17 is a distance to the sun .",
    "dimensionless parameter @xmath18 defines a balance between the solar gravitation and radiation pressure . in this work",
    "we assume that @xmath18 is equal to 1.258 .",
    "in this paper we consider three models which differ each from other by boundary conditions at 90 au .",
    "* model 1 * is the one - component hot model that implies the maxwellian velocity distribution function at the outer boundary . for the specific calculations performed in the frame of this model we use parameters of the maxwellian distribution ( i.e. number density , bulk velocity and temperature ) calculated at 90 au in the upwind direction in the frame of the baranov - malama model with parameters of chosen to be the same as in @xcite .",
    "these values at 90 au are : n@xmath19 = 0.54 @xmath20 , v@xmath21 = -0.79@xmath22 , t@xmath19 = 15 000  k , where n@xmath23=0.18  @xmath16 , v@xmath23=26.4  km / s .",
    "these parameters correspond to the mixture of the primary and secondary interstellar atoms .",
    "note , the effects of the heliospheric interface are taken in this model at zero level by taking parameters in the maxwellian distribution different from the chism parameters .",
    "* model 2 * is so - called two - component hot model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case model  1",
    "is employed separately for the primary and secondary populations of interstellar atoms .",
    "the velocity distribution functions are assumed to be maxwellian for each of the populations and parameters of the distribution functions were calculated in the frame of baranov - malama model .",
    "these parameters for the primary interstellar atoms are : n@xmath24 = 0.22 @xmath20 , v@xmath25 = -1.06@xmath22 , t@xmath24 = 6 840  k , and for the secondary interstellar atoms : n@xmath26 = 0.32 @xmath20 , v@xmath27 = -0.63@xmath22 , t@xmath26 = 18 126  k.    as it was shown in @xcite , model 2 leads to significant discrepancies in the distribution of h atoms inside the heliosphere as compared with the self - consistent baranov - malama model .",
    "this fact is connected with non - maxwellian behavior of the velocity distribution function of hydrogen atoms after their crossing the heliospheric interface @xcite . in * model 3",
    "* we use the boundary conditions allowing to get the distribution of h atom inside the heliosphere in very good agreement with the distribution obtained in the frame of baranov - malama model . for the primary interstellar atoms the distribution function at 90 au is chosen as 3d normal distribution . in this case",
    "all zero , first and second moments of the velocity distribution function are taken into account ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and calculated in the frame of baranov - malama model . however , for the population of the secondary interstellar atoms such approach does not give the full agreement with the baranov - malama model because the distribution function of this population is asymmetric with respect to its maximum and it has nonzero third moments which are neglected in the 3d normal distribution .",
    "that is why for the secondary interstellar atoms @xcite have used the velocity distribution function of at 90 au calculated by monte - carlo in the frame of the baranov - malama model .",
    "it was shown that 15 - 20 millions of unsplitted @xcite trajectories in the monte - carlo code is enough in order to get acceptable accuracy of calculations . in this paper",
    "we follow @xcite approach for the primary interstellar atoms and use the numerically calculated velocity distribution function as the boundary conditions at 90 au for the secondary interstellar atoms .",
    "it is important to note here that for the stationary and axisymmetric case model 3 provides the same distributions within 90 au from the sun as the baranov - malama model .",
    "however , computationally our model is more effective and allows to calculate the velocity distribution function everywhere inside the heliosphere with required precision .",
    "moreover , our model allows to study local ( i.e. within the heliosphere ) time - dependent and 3d phenomena very effectively .",
    "the backscattered ly-@xmath0 profiles i(*r*,@xmath28,@xmath29 ) were computed for anti - solar radial directions ( @xmath29 ) for an observer located at 1 au . here",
    "* r * is a position of observer , @xmath28 is a frequency of the backscattered radiation , @xmath29 is the line - of - sight .",
    "we use `` self - absorption '' approximation @xcite . in this approximation",
    "only once scattered photons are considered ( i.e. multiple scattering of photons are neglected ) , and absorption of the photons between the sun and the scattering point is neglected . despite this simplified `` self - absorption '' approach gives similar results as compared with a full radiative transfer model .",
    "@xcite have shown that for the line - width of the backscattered profile at 1 au the difference between full radiative transfer model and the self - absorption model is less than 15 % for the upwind direction and becomes smaller as the line - of - sight moves from upwind to downwind . in the downwind direction the two approaches give practically the same line - widths .",
    "the simplified self - absorption approach is sufficient for the purposes of this paper . as it will be seen",
    "the effects of the heliospheric interface are essentially larger than the difference between the full radiative transfer and self - absorption models .    the radiative transfer equation for i(*r*,@xmath28,@xmath29 ) can be written as follows : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the number density of hydrogen atoms , @xmath32 is the differential scattering cross - section that is proportional to the projection of the hydrogen distribution function on the line - of - sight , j(@xmath33,@xmath28,-@xmath34 ) is the atomic emission coefficient which measures the number of photons emitted by a hydrogen atom per second per frequency unit and per solid angle .",
    "note , that scattered photons travel in the direction opposite to the line - of - sight direction i.e. in @xmath35 .",
    "the first term in the right hand of the equation ( [ transfer ] ) is a loss term due to absorption of the scattered photons and the second term is a local source of the emission due to scattering process .",
    "the equation  ( [ transfer ] ) has a classical solution in case of the self - absorption approximation : @xmath36 where , @xmath37 is a coordinate along the line - of - sight , @xmath38 is the optical thickness for scattered photons with frequency @xmath28 going from the scattered point @xmath39 to observer at point @xmath33 .",
    "ly-@xmath0 profile is measured here in rayleigh . in this solution",
    "only once scattered photons are taken into account , and absorption of primary solar photons between the sun and scattering point is neglected .",
    "atomic emission coefficient can be represented as : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is a scattering phase function that expresses the relation between direction of propagation of the photon before and after scattering @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 is a flux of primary ( solar ) ly-@xmath0 photons with the frequency of @xmath43 at point @xmath44 .",
    "we use the solar ly-@xmath0 spectra @xcite to calculate solar ly-@xmath0 flux at the earth orbit with defined frequency . in that case when line - of - sight is radial , there is a simple relation between frequency of the primary solar photon @xmath43 and frequency of the backscattered photon @xmath28 : @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the frequency at line center .",
    "thus , if we know the hydrogen velocity distribution function in the whole heliosphere , we can calculate the profiles of the backscattered ly-@xmath0 radiation .    since we consider the two different populations of interstellar h atoms inside the heliosphere it is possible to calculate profiles of the radiation scattered by each populations separately . to do this we consider photons that were scattered by the primary and secondary interstellar atoms independently .",
    "optical thickness is calculated for the mixture of the primary and secondary atoms , since a photon scattered , for example , on the primary interstellar atom may then be absorbed by both the primary or secondary atoms .",
    "we calculate the following moments of the backscattered radiation profiles :    @xmath47 @xmath48;}\\ ] ] @xmath49.}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , @xmath52 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the line - shift of the spectra is often called as the line - of sight velocity , and the line - width is also called as the line - of - sight ( or apparent ) temperature .",
    "these integral characteristics of the backscattered ly-@xmath0 profile reflect the properties of the velocity distribution function of h atoms inside the heliosphere , but they do not coincide and should not be mixed up with the bulk velocity and temperature of hydrogen atoms far away from the sun .",
    "we computed the backscattered ly-@xmath0 profiles and their moments by making use of three described above models of the hydrogen distribution inside the heliosphere .",
    "all computations were performed for the anti - solar directions . for the 2d axisymmetric problem considered here each line of sight",
    "is characterized by one angle @xmath7 that is counted from z - axis ( see fig.[interface - sc ]  b ) .",

    "[ lya_mom ] shows the intensities ( left column ) , line - shifts ( center - column ) and line - widths ( right column ) of the backscattered ly-@xmath0 radiation at 1 au as functions of the line - of - sight angle @xmath7 . for models 2 and 3",
    "the profiles of the photons scattered by the primary and secondary interstellar h atoms were computed separately ( plots b , c in fig .",
    "[ lya_mom ] ) .",
    "the total backscattered profile was calculated as well ( plot a ) . for model  1 that has only one component of hydrogen",
    "we compute only characteristics of the total ly-@xmath0 radiation .    for the total radiation ( plots a ) models 1 and 2 lead to systematic increase of the intensities as compared with the intensities calculated for model 3 .",
    "comparison of models 2 and 3 for the primary and secondary populations ( plots b and c ) shows that the increase in intensities is due to the secondary h atom component ( compare left - columns in the plots a and c ) . models 2 and 3 are nicely agreed for the primary h atom component .",
    "now , we will explore the main reason of the different results produced by models 2 and 3 .",
    "the models are only different in the boundary condition .",
    "we can identify two differences of the boundary conditions .",
    "the first is the dependence of the boundary conditions on the angle @xmath7 in model 3 that does not exist in model 2 , since model 2 assumes constant parameters at the boundary .",
    "the second difference is the non - maxwellian velocity distribution function at 90 au in model 3 , while in model 2 the velocity distribution is maxwellian . to explore which of the two identified reasons is mainly responsible for the differences in the spectral properties of ly-@xmath0 we perform additional model calculation ( model 2a ) . in model 2a",
    "we assume that velocity distribution functions at the outer boundary of 90 au are maxwellain for both the primary and the secondary populations of h atoms . however , the parameters of the maxwellians ( i.e. number density , bulk velocity and temperature ) are functions of the angle @xmath7 that were calculated in the frame of baranov - malama model .",
    "therefore , model 2a allows to separate the effects of non - uniform flow of h atoms at 90 au after they passed the heliospheric interface from the kinetic effects connected with non - maxwellian features of the velocity distribution function .",
    "results of model 2a are also shown in fig .",
    "[ lya_mom ]  a. it is seen that model 2a and model 3 produce very close results in the backscattered ly-@xmath0 intensities , although there is a difference of 20 rayleigh for the upwind direction .",
    "it means that the main difference of models 2 and 3 is due to non - uniform flow of h atoms at 90 au in model 3 .",
    "however , still there is a smaller difference due to non - maxwellian behavior of the velocity distribution function at 90 au ( which is taken into account only in model 3 ) .    at first view ,",
    "it is not evident why the angle dependence of the h atom parameters at 90 au would strongly influence the backscattered ly-@xmath0 emission measured at 1 au .",
    "it is especially so , because the main emissivity region for the backscattered ly-@xmath0 radiation at 1 au is located approximately at 2 au for the upwind line - of - sight and at 7 au for downwind . from the simple ( naive ) consideration",
    "one could expect that the most of h atoms in the regions close to the sun would arrive from upwind .",
    "however , @xcite have shown ( in the case of the hot model ) that the most of the atoms arrive into the vicinity of the sun not from upwind .",
    "the same is true for our model . to illustrate this we calculate function @xmath53 for two points ( i=1,2 ) inside the maximum emissivity region .",
    "point 1 is located in the upwind direction at 2  au from the sun .",
    "point 2 is located in the downwind direction at 7  au from the sun .",
    "the function @xmath53 represents the contribution to the total number density at a given point ( point 1 for curve 1 in fig .",
    "[ n_vr_l ]  a and point 2 for curve 2 ) from those particles that cross the outer boundary of 90 au at @xmath54 .",
    "this function @xmath55 is defined as follows ( for certainty we present all formulas only for point 1 ) : @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the velocity distribution function of h atom . the integration is performed over those @xmath58 that correspond to the trajectories crossing the outer sphere of 90 au at @xmath54 . here for simplicity we consider a balance between the solar gravitation and radiation pressure ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this means that all atom s trajectories are straight lines . in this case",
    "subspace @xmath60 is a cone with apex angle equal to @xmath61 as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ konus ] .",
    "let us introduce a spherical coordinate system in the velocity space .",
    "it means that we describe velocity vector @xmath62 by its module @xmath63 and two spherical angles @xmath64 and @xmath65 , i.e. orthogonal coordinates of vector @xmath62 can be represented as follows : @xmath66    ) is located in the upwind direction at 2 au from the sun . in the case of straight atom s trajectories we consider only those atoms that arrive to point 1 from the outer boundary at @xmath67 .",

    "hence , for our case integral  ( [ n_theta ] ) can be rewritten in the following form : @xmath71    now , in the case of @xmath59 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a corresponding velocity distribution function at 90 au , @xmath74 is the loss of hydrogen atoms along its trajectory from the outer boundary to point 1 due to ionization processes and @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath73 does not depend on angle @xmath65 due to axial symmetry of the boundary conditions",
    ". therefore expression  ( [ n_2 ] ) can be represented as : @xmath76    function @xmath77 decreases with @xmath67 for each given value of @xmath78 , because at 90 au @xmath79 and distribution function has a maximum in the upwind direction .",
    "loss - function @xmath80 increases with @xmath67 for point 1 because length of the trajectory has a minimal value in upwind and @xmath81 decreases with @xmath67 .",
    "hence , function @xmath82 decreases with @xmath67 .",
    "and @xmath83 increases with @xmath84 for @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "therefore @xmath86 that is a product of @xmath83 and @xmath82 should have a maximum for some @xmath67 between 0@xmath87 and 90@xmath87 .",

    "contribution to the radial velocity was calculated only for point  2 .",
    "different curves in plot b correspond to different models of hydrogen distribution : solid line is model 3 , dashed line is model 2 and dashed - dot line is model 1 . all calculations are performed for the mixture of primary and secondary interstellar atoms . ]",
    "[ n_vr_l ]  a shows @xmath55 calculated numerically for point 1 in upwind ( curve  1 ) and for point 2 in downwind ( curve  2 ) .",
    "it is seen that the most part of the interstellar atoms arrive to the point  1 from @xmath89 and to the point  2 from @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , contrary to the simple consideration the most of h atoms arrive to the vicinity of the sun not exactly from upwind .",
    "now , it is clear that the excess in the backscattered ly-@xmath0 intensity in models 1 and 2 as compared with the model 3 is connected with larger number densities of h atoms inside the heliosphere in models 1 and 2 due to non varying with @xmath7 boundary conditions while in model 3 the number density at 90 au decreases with @xmath7 .",
    "it also becomes clear why the intensities ( and line - shifts ) of the radiation scattered by the primary interstellar atoms are in agreement for all models ( fig .",
    "[ lya_mom ]  b ) .",
    "this is because on the one hand , angle - dependence of hydrogen parameters at 90 au for the primary interstellar atoms is weaker than for the secondary interstellar atoms , and on the other hand , distribution function of primary interstellar atoms is closer to maxwellian than distribution function of secondary interstellar atoms .    from the middle column of fig .",
    "[ lya_mom ] ( a , c ) it is seen that there are noticeable differences in the line - shifts of models 2 and 3 in the downwind direction .",
    "the differences are seen for the total radiation as well as for the radiation scattered by the secondary interstellar atoms . at the same time",
    "there is almost no discrepancies in line - shifts of model 1 and model 3 . in spite of model 1",
    "is the simplest model without any effects of the heliospheric interface , and one could expect the difference .    in order to understand these results we computed the contribution to the total radial velocity of hydrogen at point  2 ( 7 au in downwind ) from the particles that reach this point from the different directions .",
    "similar to @xmath91 contribution to the radial velocity can be calculated as follows : @xmath92 fig .",
    "[ n_vr_l ]  b shows @xmath93 , calculated at point  2 for different models .",
    "it is seen that the maximum of @xmath93 is located approximately at @xmath7=45@xmath1 for all models . however , model 2 ( dashed curve in fig . 3",
    "b ) has a non - negligible contribution of the negative values of @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "the negative values of @xmath93 are due to relatively hotter secondary interstellar atoms in the downwind hemisphere ( due to large temperature of secondary interstellar atoms and absence of decrease of the number density from upwind to downwind in model 2 ) , which can reach point  2 from large values of angle @xmath7 .",
    "this makes the total line - shift of model 2 in the downwind region smaller as compared with models 1 and 3 .",
    "contributions of negative @xmath93 in model 1 and model 3 are smaller than in model 2 but due to different reasons . in model 3",
    "the contribution of the particles with negative @xmath93 are significantly reduced because of small number density of such particles at the outer boundary that follows from the self - consistent model results . as for model 1",
    "we do not see this effect due to relatively smaller temperature of the mixture of primary and secondary interstellar atoms as compared with the temperature of the secondary interstellar atoms which exist in model 2 .",
    "now let us consider the line - width of the ly-@xmath0 ( right column in fig .",
    "[ lya_mom ] ) .",
    "plot a demonstrates that there are essential qualitative differences in the line - widths calculated on the basis of the three models .",
    "model 1 shows a monotonic increase of the line - width with the angle @xmath7 .",
    "model 2 shows a minimum of the line - width at @xmath9560@xmath1 .",
    "model 3 shows a small local maximum at @xmath95150@xmath1 .",
    "these results demonstrate that the line - width of the backscattered ly-@xmath0 profiles is very sensitive to the properties of hydrogen distribution at the entrance to the heliosphere . in the next section",
    "we will focus on understanding of these qualitative differences and will show that the main causes of the difference are in kinetic non - maxwellian nature of the hydrogen velocity distribution function at 90 au .",
    "note also , that for the line - widths the simplified model 2a results are close to model 3 in the upwind hemisphere .",
    "however , large discrepancies in the downwind region still take place .",
    "now we will consider the differences in the line - widths of the backscattered spectra calculated separately for the primary and secondary populations of h atoms ( right columns in fig .",
    "[ lya_mom ]  b , c ) . for both populations",

    "the mean thermal velocities of the h atoms are different in different directions .",
    "moreover this difference between t@xmath96 and t@xmath97 temperatures increases approaching to the sun due to local effects . the large maxima of the line - widths at @xmath100 ( fig .",
    "[ lya_mom ]  b , c ) are connected with the changes of the radial kinetic temperature t@xmath101 of h atoms at 90 au as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "for example , when observer looks toward upwind ( i.e. @xmath102 ) t@xmath101=t@xmath96 , for the line - of - sight of @xmath103 t@xmath101=t@xmath97 and for line - of - sight of @xmath104 t@xmath101=t@xmath96 again . in model 3 at the outer boundary t@xmath97 is larger than t@xmath96 for each of the interstellar populations of h atoms ( that follows from baranov - malama model results ) .",

    "[ t_tot ]  a ) since neither two - component nor non - maxwellian effects are taken into account in this model .",
    "the line - width increases monotonically from the upwind direction to downwind .",
    "such a behavior of the line - width of the backscattered ly-@xmath0 profile reflects the properties of the h atom distribution since the ionization ( due to so - called selection effect ) leads to decrease of effective temperature of h atoms in upwind and increase of the temperature in the downwind direction ( see for example fig .  3.5 in @xcite ) .",
    "results of the two - component hot model 2b that does not account for ionization ( curve 2b on fig .",
    "[ t_tot ] ) illustrate the effect of the two populations of the interstellar h atoms .",
    "these two populations have different bulk velocities @xmath106 ( at 90 au in the upwind direction : @xmath107  km / s and @xmath108  km / s ) and rather small thermal velocities .",
    "therefore in the upwind and downwind directions ( where @xmath109 ) the line - of - sight projections of the velocity distribution functions of the primary and secondary components are overlap each other in the velocity space only partially . in the crosswind direction @xmath110 for both primary and secondary interstellar atoms .",
    "this means that in this direction the projections of the distribution functions on the radial line - of - sight overlap completely . that is why the radial temperature of the mixture of primary and secondary interstellar atoms is smaller in the crosswind direction than in the upwind and downwind directions",
    "this minimum of the radial temperature of h atoms in crosswind is reflected in the ly-@xmath0 line - widths as it is clearly seen from model 2b .",
    "results of the two - component hot model ( curve  2 ) where the ionization is taken into account combine both the increase of @xmath111 from upwind to downwind due to ionization effect and the local minimum in crosswind due to two populations of h atoms . hence , a small minimum of @xmath111 at @xmath7=50 - 60@xmath1 is seen in curve  2 .    the line - width obtained by making use of model 3",

    "in particular , differences between kinetic temperature s components @xmath4 and @xmath112 play an important role .",
    "curve 3c corresponds to the model 3c that does not take into account ionization and in addition in model 3c we assume that the solar ly-@xmath0 flux does not depend on frequency .",
    "note that in all other models we use the shape of the solar spectrum from @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the effect of minimum in @xmath111 at @xmath103 ( due to two populations ) practically disappears in model 3c , but still is visible .",
    "this practical disappearance of the minimum is connected with the increase of the radial kinetic temperature t@xmath101 with increase @xmath7 at 90 au .",
    "the effect of t@xmath101 increase with @xmath7 compensates the effect of the minimum of the radial hydrogen temperature in crosswind due to the two populations of h atoms .",
    "that is why the value of the minimum of the line - widths at @xmath103 is much smaller for model 3c as compared with model 2b .",
    "it is interesting to note , that for model 3b ( that is more realistic than model 3c ) local minimum of @xmath111 at @xmath7 = 90@xmath1 replaces by small maximum .",
    "this effect is due to shape of the solar spectrum .",
    "remember , that in model 3c we use flat solar spectrum while in model 3b we use nonuniform solar spectra from @xcite .",
    "let us return to model 3 without any additional assumptions .",
    "it is seen ( curve  3 ) that there is no minimum of @xmath111 at 50 - 60@xmath1 at all in this case .",
    "but there is a small maximum at @xmath113 .",

    "in this work we applied different models of hydrogen distribution in the heliosphere to compute the spectral properties of the backscattered solar ly-@xmath0 radiation as it would be measured at 1 au in the anti - solar directions .",
    "we have found out that imprints of the heliospheric interface in the h atom distribution inside the heliosphere have a strong influence on the ly-@xmath0 parameters .",
    "we considered the minimum of the line - width of the backscattered ly-@xmath0 radiation at 50 - 60@xmath1 from upwind that was observed by swan @xcite . in the experimental data",
    "the line - width in the directions of @xmath11650 - 60@xmath1 is smaller than in the upwind direction by 1500 - 2000 k. this minimum is seen for 1996 and 1997 and practically is not seen for 2002 - 2003 years although data points for small angles are absent for this period ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  7 ) .",
    "this minimum was explained ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by existence of the two different populations of the interstellar hydrogen atoms that are shifted in velocity space .",
    "however , we noticed that the line - width calculated with 2d stationary baranov - malama model @xcite has no any minimum of t@xmath117 .",
    "non - stationary 2d baranov - malama model @xcite predicts small minimum in 2003 , but there is no minimum in 1997 .    in this work",
    "we theoretically explore the nature of the observed minimum on the basis of three types of the hydrogen distribution inside the heliosphere .",
    "it was shown that the minimum of the line - widths appears only for the two - component hot model , and there is no minimum at all for model 3 that takes into account all effects of the heliospheric interface .",
    "it was found that the absence of the minimum in model 3 is because the effect of the two components is compensated by the non - maxwellian features of the velocity distribution of h atoms at 90 au after they passed the heliospheric interface region , namely , by strong anisotropy of the kinetic temperatures of h atoms ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "therefore , the question why the the minimum of the ly-@xmath0 line - width exists in the experimental data remains to be open . possibilities to get the minimum still exist in the frame of model 3 .",
    "firstly , models considered here does not take into account the effects of latitudinal and solar cycle variations of the photoionzation and charge exchange rates as well as the solar radiation pressure .",
    "these local effects may potentially change the result of this paper .",
    "another possibility is to change the boundary conditions at 90 au , i.e. to make a change in the model of the heliospheric interface .",
    "for example , interstellar magnetic field may play a key role @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the multi - component nature of both the heliospheric and interstellar plasmas @xcite . in this non - equilibrium plasma model",
    "the interstellar pickup ions are treated as the separate kinetic component .",
    "the plasma temperature in the vicinity of the heliopause is smaller in this model as compared with the baranov - malama model .",
    "therefore , we could expect a decrease in the kinetic temperatures of the secondary interstellar atoms .",
    "this might make larger velocity space separation of the primary and secondary interstellar atoms at 90 au .",
    "the separation may effectively increase the effect of the two populations as compared with the other effects . as the result",
