    "_ ... but it s easier than most people think . _ in radio continuum the typical degrees of polarization are much higher than in the other spectral ranges , and we benefit from the development of large instruments and sensitive receivers .",
    "this is why most of our knowledge on interstellar magnetic fields in our galaxy (; ; ) and in external galaxies is based on polarized radio emission and its faraday rotation ( see also ; ) . to detect extended features and achieve high resolution",
    ", data from interferometric ( synthesis ) and single dish telescopes have to be combined .",
    "_ ... simply the best ones .",
    "_ interstellar magnetic fields are illuminated by cosmic - ray electrons emitting synchrotron radiation , the dominant contribution to the diffuse radio continuum emission at centimeter and decimeter wavelengths .",
    "synchrotron emission is intrinsically highly linearly polarized , 7075% in a completely regular magnetic field .",
    "the observable degree of polarization in galaxies is reduced by a contribution of unpolarized thermal emission which may dominate in star - forming regions , by faraday depolarization ( ) and by geometrical depolarization within the beam . a map of the _ total _ nonthermal intensity ( fig .",
    "1 ) reveals the _ strength of the total interstellar magnetic fields _ in the plane of the sky , while the _ polarized intensity and polarization angle _ ( figs .  2 and 3 )",
    "reveal the _ strength and structure of the resolved regular fields _ in the plane of the sky .",
    "the orientation of polarization vectors is changed in a magneto - ionic medium by _ faraday rotation _ which is generally small below about @xmath1  cm so that the @xmath2vectors ( i.e. the observed @xmath3vectors rotated by @xmath4 ) directly trace the _ orientation _ of the regular fields in the sky plane .",
    "_ ... much stronger than most people think .",
    "_ the average strength of the total @xmath5 and the resolved regular field @xmath6 in the plane of the sky can be derived from the total and polarized radio synchrotron intensity , respectively , if energy - density _ equipartition _ between cosmic rays and magnetic fields is assumed ( ) .    in our galaxy",
    "the accuracy of the equipartition assumption can be tested , because we have independent information from in - situ measurements about the local cosmic - ray energy density and from @xmath7-ray data about their distribution .",
    "combination of the radio synchrotron emission , the local cosmic - ray electron density and diffuse continuum @xmath7-rays yields a local strength of the total field of @xmath8 g ( ) , the same value as derived from energy equipartition ( berkhuijsen in ) .",
    "even the scale length of the radial variation of the equipartition field strength is similar to that in .",
    "the mean equipartition strength of the total field for a sample of 74 spiral galaxies ( derived from their total radio flux densities ) is @xmath9 g , ranging between @xmath10 g in radio - faint galaxies like m31 and m33 , and @xmath11 g in grand - design galaxies like m51 , m83 and ngc  6946 . in prominent spiral arms",
    "the total field strength is 2025@xmath0 g , up to 40@xmath0 g in nuclear regions ( sect .",
    "7.3 ) , and even 1  mg in molecular clouds compressed by supernova shocks ( ) , in compact cloud cores (; ) and in filaments near the galactic center (; ) .",
    "_ ... more important than most people think .",
    "_ a standard approach to estimate the dynamical importance of various competing forces is to compare the corresponding energy densities ( table  1 ) .",
    "note , however , that the dynamical effects of magnetic fields are anisotropic due to their vector nature .",
    "ngc  6946 ( fig .  2 ) is a useful standard spiral galaxy because it has no companion , no strong density waves , no active nucleus and has been observed in many spectral ranges . the average total equipartition field strength in the inner disk ( within 4  kpc radius ) is @xmath12 g ( using the map of synchrotron emission by ) and the average density of the warm ionized gas ( @xmath13  k ) is @xmath14 ( using their map of thermal radio emission and a filling factor of 5% ) .",
    "the map of the total neutral gas ( molecular + atomic , where the molecular gas dominates until about 5  kpc radius ) yields a mean number density ( within a disk of 4  kpc radius and 100  pc height ) of @xmath15  h  atoms @xmath16 . the turbulent velocity of the neutral gas is assumed to be @xmath17  km / s , as for the cold neutral gas in our galaxy ( ) , and the global rotation velocity @xmath18  km / s .",
    "for the cosmic rays we know the slope of the energy spectrum ( @xmath19\\propto n_0 e^{-2\\alpha -1 } de$ ] ) from the observed synchrotron spectral index @xmath20 , but no information on the absolute particle number @xmath21 is available so that we have to rely on the validity of energy equipartition with the magnetic fields .",

    "( the thermal energy of the cold gas is negligible . )",
    "a low thermal contribution to the total gas pressure was also found in the local galactic ism (; jenkins , this volume ) .",

    "the magnetic field dominates thermal processes in the disk and in the halo of galaxies .",
    "turbulent motion of neutral gas and total magnetic fields in the inner disk of ngc  6946 are roughly in energy equipartition ( table  1 ) ( but see sect .",
    "this fact supports the idea that magnetic fields are anchored in the ( partly ionized ) envelopes of gas clouds ( ) . this also explains the tight radio  infrared correlation (; ) . between the clouds ,",
    "field loops can be generated by the parker instability which can drive the galactic dynamo (; ; hanasz et al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "interstellar magnetic fields affect the motion of small gas clouds ( ) and their collision rate .",
    "the importance of internal fields for the evolution of clouds is generally accepted , though not understood (; ; ; ) . however , little is known about the influence of magnetic fields in the ism on general properties of star formation .",
    "stability of cloud cores depends also on the fractional ionization by cosmic rays , and the number density of cosmic rays in the ism is controlled by the interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "a larger fractional ionization allows a better coupling of the fields to the gas ( weaker ambipolar diffusion ) and thus stronger internal fields . as a result , the field strength inside and outside of the clouds should be correlated .    the star formation rate @xmath34 is known to relate non - linearly with gas density @xmath35 , the _ schmidt law _",
    "@xmath36 , with @xmath37 ( ) . hence , the star formation efficiency ( @xmath38 ) increases with gas density . as the total field strength @xmath39 in galaxies",
    "is known to scale globally with @xmath35 as @xmath40 ( ) , a relation @xmath41 could well be the cause of the non - linearity .",
    "the observational data are still poor ( ) .",
    "the supernova - driven ism model including magnetic fields by indeed predicts a significant increase of the average star - formation rate with field strength .",
    "furthermore , strong fields may shift the stellar mass spectrum towards the more massive stars ( ) .",
    "most observable quantities in galactic disks have exponential distributions . for ngc  6946 the scale length of the synchrotron emission is @xmath42  kpc ( radial range 38  kpc ) .",
    "the synchrotron disk is a combination of the distributions of cosmic - ray electrons and total magnetic fields . in case of equipartition between these two components ,",
    "the scale length of the total magnetic field is @xmath4316  kpc , and the scale lengths of the magnetic energy density and of the cosmic rays are @xmath44 * 8  kpc*. all other energy densities in table  1 fall off with the scale length of the neutral gas @xmath450.1  kpc if @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are radially constant , or with a smaller scale length if one of these parameters decreases with radius .",
    "the scale length of the distribution of supernova remnants ( the sources of cosmic rays ) in ngc  6946 is only @xmath492  kpc ( sasaki et al .",
    ", this volume ) so that a large diffusion length is needed to reach equipartition also at large radii ( see the cosmic - ray propagation model by ) . a large value of @xmath50 is also required to explain the distribution of galactic @xmath7-rays ( ) .    as a consequence of the different scale lengths @xmath51 decreases with radius : the dominance of the magnetic field increases towards large radii .",
    "it is however hard to understand why the magnetic field energy density is larger that of the turbulent motions",
    ". this can be in conflict with turbulent generation of interstellar magnetic fields which predicts energy equipartition between turbulent motions and magnetic fields , and hence @xmath52 ( if @xmath53const ) and @xmath54 .",
    "radial diffusion of the magnetic field ( ) , field connections through the wind - driven halo ( ) or a supra - equipartition turbulent dynamo ( ) are possible explanations .    in the outermost parts of galaxies",
    "the magnetic field energy density may even reach the level of global rotational gas motion .",
    "if so , the rotation curves at large radii could be affected by magnetic fields , as discussed by .",
    "field strengths in the outer parts of galaxies are difficult to measure .",
    "synchrotron emission is weak , but faraday rotation of polarized background sources can be measured out to large radii .",
    "found evidence for regular fields in m31 at 25  kpc radius of similar strength as in the inner disk .",
    "more detailed studies in a number of galaxies are required .",
    "maps of the total radio emission and isocam maps of the mid - infrared dust emission ( fig .",
    "1 ) reveal a surprisingly close connection (; ) , suggesting a coupling of the _ total _ magnetic field to the warm dust mixed with cool gas ( @xmath40 , ) .",
    "strongest total fields generally coincide with highest emission from dust and gas in the spiral arms ( fig .  1 ) , whereas the polarized emission is weak in the arms due to field tangling by turbulent motions or by supernova shock fronts .",
    "radio polarization observations show that in most galaxies the _ regular _ field follows the spiral structure seen in the stars and the gas , though generally offset , sometimes forming _ magnetic spiral arms _ between the gaseous arms ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "here the energy density of the regular field alone ( @xmath55 g ) is comparable to that of the neutral interarm gas ( @xmath56 ) .    in galaxies with strong density waves ( like m  51 )",
    "the regular field is strong at the positions of the dust lanes on the inner edge of the spiral arms .",
    "however , the arm - interarm contrast of the regular field is low .",
    "the strong field may modify the gas flow and the compression ratio .",
    "the observation of large - scale patterns in faraday rotation measures proves that the regular field in galaxies has a coherent direction and is not generated by compression or stretching of irregular fields in gas flows .",
    "the _ dynamo _",
    "mechanism is able to generate and preserve coherent magnetic fields of spiral shape (; ) .",
    "the observed alignment of magnetic pitch angles with those of the gaseous arms can be achieved by inclusion of the shear flow around spiral arms ( ) .",
    "future dynamo models should address the interaction between dynamo wave and density wave .",
    "average radio intensity , radio luminosity and star - formation activity in barred galaxies correlate with _ relative bar length _ ( ) . in the best - studied case , ngc  1097 , the general similarity of the @xmath57vectors ( fig .  3 ) and gas streamlines around the bar as obtained in simulations is striking ( ) .",
    "the field lines are a tracer of the sheared flow pattern in the sky plane which is otherwise unobservable",
    ". remarkably , the optical image of ngc  1097 shows dust filaments outside the bar which are aligned with the field .",
    "the bar s major dust lane is believed to indicate the shock front . however , the region of strongest shear in ngc  1097 ( where the field changes its direction abruptly ) is located @xmath58  kpc in front of the dust lane ( fig .",
    "3 ) , in conflict with the hydrodynamical models . furthermore",
    ", the regular field is only weakly compressed in the bar .",
    "either the field decouples from the gas ( at least from its diffuse component ) and thus avoids the gas shock , or there is no shock at all .",
    "detailed observations of the velocity field are required .",
    "used velocity shear and dynamo action to model the field configuration , but a mhd model including the back - reaction of the field onto the gas flow is still needed .",
    "many barred galaxies have circumnuclear rings , sites of ongoing intense star formation , sometimes with an active nucleus in the center",
    ". radio polarization maps of these inner regions ( ) revealed strong regular fields ( up to 40@xmath0 g ) with spiral patterns and large pitch angles , accompanied by spiral dust filaments visible on optical images .",
    "magnetic stress in the circumnuclear ring can drive mass inflow to feed the active nucleus , as suggested for ngc  1097 ( ) .      in edge - on galaxies the observed field orientations are mainly parallel to the disk ( ) . a prominent exception is ngc  4631 with the brightest and largest halo observed so far ( ) , composed of vertical magnetic spurs connected to star - forming regions in the disk ( ) .",
    "the field is probably dragged out by a strong galactic wind .",
    "the magnetic energy density in the halo of , e.g. m83 , exceeds that of the hot gas ( ) .",
    "halo magnetic fields are important for the propagation of cosmic rays , the formation of a galactic wind ( ) and the stability of gas filaments (; dettmar , this volume ) .",
    "much has been learnt about the global properties of interstellar magnetic fields , but their detailed structure on scales below about 100  pc is still unclear .",
    "polarization observations in our galaxy trace structures on pc and sub - pc scales ( e.g. ; ) .",
    "future radio polarization observations with increased sensitivity and resolution ( extended vla , square kilometer array ) will show the full wealth of magnetic structures in galaxies ."
