    "our interest in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 couplings and vertex form factors is connected with our attempt to take pion - loop effects into account when describing the electromagnetic structure of @xmath9 and @xmath10 within a constituent - quark model .",
    "as it turns out , the calculation of the loop effects boils down to a purely hadronic problem , in which the quark substructure of the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 is hidden in strong and electromagnetic form factors of bare  baryons , i.e. eigenstates of the pure confinement problem . since @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 couplings and vertex form factors are basic building blocks of nuclear physics and every hadronic model of meson - baryon dynamics , their microscopic description is also highly desirable on more fundamental grounds .",
    "our starting point for calculating the strong @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 couplings and form factors is the mass - eigenvalue problem for three quarks that are confined by an instantaneous potential and can emit and reabsorb a pion . to describe this system in a relativistically invariant way",
    ", we make use of the point - form of relativistic quantum mechanics . employing the bakamjian - thomas construction",
    ", the overall four - momentum operator @xmath14 can be separated into a free 4-velocity operator @xmath15 and an invariant mass operator @xmath16 that contains all the internal motion , i.e. @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "bakamjian - thomas - type mass operators are most conveniently represented by means of velocity states @xmath18 , which specify an @xmath19-body system by its overall velocity @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , the cm momenta @xmath22 of the individual particles and their ( canonical ) spin projections @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "since the physical baryons of our model contain , in addition to the @xmath24-component , also a @xmath25-component , the mass eigenvalue problem can be formulated as a 2-channel problem of the form @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 denoting the two fock - components of the physical baryon states @xmath29 .",
    "the mass operators on the diagonal contain , in addition to the relativistic particle energies , an instantaneous confinement potential between the quarks . the vertex operator @xmath30 connects the two channels and describes the absorption ( emission ) of the @xmath31 by one of the quarks .",
    "its velocity - state representation can be directly connected to a corresponding field - theoretical interaction lagrangean  @xcite .",
    "we use a pseudovector interaction lagrangean for the @xmath32-coupling @xmath33    after elimination of the @xmath25-channel the mass - eigenvalue equation takes on the form @xmath34\\ket{\\psi_{3q}}=m\\,\\ket{\\psi_{3q}}\\ , , \\label{eq : mphys}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is an optical potential that describes the emission and reabsorption of the pion by the quarks . one can now solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : mphys ] ) by expanding the ( @xmath24-components of the ) eigenstates in terms of eigenstates of the pure confinement problem , i.e. @xmath36 , and determining the open coefficients @xmath37 . since the particles that propagate within the pion loop are also bare baryons ( rather than quarks ) , the problem of solving the mass eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : mphys ] ) reduces then to a pure hadronic problem , in which the dressing and mixing of bare baryons by means of pion loops produces finally the physical baryons .",
    "the quark substructure determines just the coupling strengths at the pion - baryon vertices and leads to vertex form factors . to set up the mass - eigenvalue equation on the hadronic level one needs matrix elements @xmath38 of the optical potential between bare baryon states .",
    "the general structure of these matrix elements is ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 are at rest ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the invariant mass of the @xmath43 system in the intermediate state and spin- as well as isospin dependencies have been suppressed .    for the cases we are interested in , i.e. the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 , the currents occurring in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vopt ] ) can be cast into the form : @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the dirac spinor of the nucleon and @xmath46 the rarita - schwinger spinor of the @xmath10 .",
    "here we have again suppressed the isospin dependence and also omitted the spin labels . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vopt ] ) and ( [ eq : currents ] ) one can then infer the analytical expression for the combination @xmath47 in terms of quark degrees of freedom  @xcite .    assuming a scalar isoscalar confinement potential , the masses of the bare nucleon and the bare delta are degenerate",
    ", the momentum part of the wave function will be the same and the spin - flavor part of the wave function is @xmath3 symmetric .",
    "rather than solving the confinement problem for a particular potential , we parameterize the momentum part of the @xmath24 wave function of @xmath48 and @xmath49 by means of a gaussian @xmath50 and consider the mass of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath51 as free parameter .",
    "the parameters of our model are therefore the oscillator parameter @xmath52 , the mass @xmath53 , the constituent - quark mass @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the @xmath32 coupling strength . for fixed @xmath56  mev ( taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ) we have adapted the remaining parameters such that the physical @xmath9 and @xmath10 masses , resulting from the mass renormalization due to pion loops ( with @xmath48 and @xmath49 intermediate states ) , agree with their experimental values . in order to tune these parameters we started with a fixed @xmath57 and @xmath52 and calculated the masses of the physical nucleon and delta as function of @xmath58 by solving the mass eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : mphys ] ) .",
    "then we have varied @xmath57 and @xmath52 such that the physical nucleon and delta masses ( i.e. @xmath59  gev and @xmath60  gev ) are obtained for a reasonable value of @xmath58 ( which also leads to a reasonable value for @xmath61 ) .",

    "it is worth noting that @xmath77 and @xmath78 do not coincide .",
    "this is , of course , no surprise , since in the first case the @xmath48 is real and the @xmath49 virtual , whereas it is just the other way round in the second case .",
    "the form factors describe thus completely different kinematical situations , but they coincide at a particular negative ( i.e. unphysical ) value of @xmath72 . since there is only one coupling strength at the @xmath69-vertex ( i.e. @xmath79 , see eq .",
