    "<S> we perform the diagonalization on density matrix . from the calculation </S>",
    "<S> , one can find that the two cavity mode frequencies have a indistinguishable effect on the entanglement , and then the frequencies are supposed to be the same as mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> when the angle @xmath26 is set to be zero , after a straightforward calculation it is found that the negativity is zero . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the two - level atom initial state is not a superposition state , and then the two - mode cavity field states will not be entangled during the time evolution process . </S>",
    "<S> the atom initial state has an important influence on the production of the entangled cavity mode state . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results of entanglement measure are presented in figure 1 to 4 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows the negativity as a function of time @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> a coherent superposition state is chosen as atomic initial state . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1(a ) is the case that the cavity is in a two - mode vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> negativity evolves with a period and the maximum value is 0.5 since the cavity systems are two qutrits . </S>",
    "<S> changing the vacuum state to a more general state , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) shows a novel feature . </S>",
    "<S> negativity changes non - smoothly and the period is obviously smaller than that in fig.1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum is 0.4 , does not reach 0.5 . it can be easily understood since the noise of the system exists . </S>",
    "<S> when one mode is in a vacuum state and the other is in a non - zero photon state , the period and the amplitude in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) decreases sharply compared with those of figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) and 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we must prepare almost the same photon number in the two cavity modes in order to get a higher entanglement and longer entanglement time . comparing the figures in fig.1 </S>",
    "<S> , the vacuum state is more useful for the production of entanglement between the cavity modes .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( a - c ) , negativity is shown as a function of the coupling constant between the atom and the modes @xmath55 , and kerr medium is set as @xmath56 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) , the negativity vibrates periodically with a maximum amplitude 0.5 when the cavities are in vacuum states . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , the negativity first climbs from zero nearly linearly , and then increases quaveringly . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , two modes have the same photon number and are indistinguishable . for @xmath57 , </S>",
    "<S> the atom does not interact with cavity modes , and the negativity is zero . </S>",
    "<S> then one can conclude that the coupling strength between atom and modes decreases the classical noise effect , then the entanglement between the two - mode cavity field is enhanced accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> but it is nt superior to the case in figure 2(a ) , in which the classical noise is absent . </S>",
    "<S> when one cavity is vacuum while the other is a common state , the entanglement increases slowly with the increasing coupling constant , and finally reaches a maximum value 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> these results can be seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> so , when two cavity modes have the same state , especially the vacuum state , negativity can easily achieve the ideal value .    </S>",
    "<S> negativity is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 as a function of kerr medium coefficient @xmath58 and the angle @xmath26 . when the rabi frequency equals to the transition frequency(@xmath59 ) , although the number of photon in two cavity modes is the same , the maximum value can not reach 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> the negativity fluctuates periodically with @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath60(n is odd ) , negativity has a maximum value . </S>",
    "<S> coupling strength between two modes field have a negative contribution on entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> so the kerr medium effect must be controlled in order to obtain anticipative entanglement .    in order to clearly show the effects of the initial state and </S>",
    "<S> evolve time on the entanglement producing , negativity as a function of angle @xmath26 and time @xmath54 is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that negativity is periodic with a period @xmath61 for the different cavity field state . in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) and 4(b ) , two cavity modes are indistinguishable . </S>",
    "<S> when kerr medium effect increases , entanglement between the two cavity modes becomes weak , so that the maximum of negativity can not reach 0.5 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4(b ) shows that some small wave peaks emerge between two maximal peaks when the two cavity modes are both in states with same photon number , which can be attributed to the noise since the modes are not vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> this figure also supports the conclusion that the cavities photon number affect the entanglement between two cavity modes . </S>",
    "<S> when one mode changes to be vacuum , negativity decreases as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also should note that when the coefficient absolute value of the atomic initial superposition state equals to each other , the greatest mode entanglement can be obtained .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the entanglement between two cavity modes . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that the entanglement is sensitive to the atom initial state . </S>",
    "<S> a superposition initial state of the atom is necessary to obtain an entangled state between the cavity modes . </S>",
    "<S> also , the number of photon inside the cavity , kerr medium and the coupling strength between cavity and atom all can greatly affect the cavity modes entanglement .    </S>",
