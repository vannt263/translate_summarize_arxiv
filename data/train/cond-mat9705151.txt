    "the nature of the mixed state of thin films of type ii superconductors is despite considerable experimental , theoretical and numerical research still unclear . in the mean - field limit , which describes the ground state of the system ,",
    "the vortices are known to form into a triangular abrikosov lattice @xcite .",
    "also it is generally accepted that close to the mean - field transition line to the normal state , the @xmath0 line , thermal fluctuations destroy that hexagonal order and lead to a vortex liquid state @xcite .",
    "however , the phase diagram between the mean - field @xmath1 and @xmath0 lines remains unclear .",
    "the kosterlitz - thouless - halperin - nelson ( kthn ) theory of a two dimensional ( 2d ) melting has been applied to superconductors @xcite yielding a phase diagram with a solid , a hexatic and a liquid phase .",
    "other theoretical work raises a doubt as to whether there is _ any _ phase transition to the mixed state and suggests that a flux lattice exists only in the zero temperature limit and that the liquid phase exists at any non - zero temperature @xcite @xcite .",
    "it has long been predicted that in the presence of disorder any long range crystalline order of a vortex lattice phase is destroyed in less than four dimensions @xcite . in the glass like state which is expected to form instead ,",
    "the length scale of the short - range crystalline order has been predicted by ovchinnikov and larkin for the zero - temperature ( mean - field ) limit .",
    "more recently the existence of a bragg glass phase with quasi long range order has been suggested .",
    "the non - perturbative analytical method used by yeo and moore @xcite , which yields a 2d flux liquid at all temperatures , has also been applied to the case of quenched random disorder , which is found to just reduce the extent of short - range crystalline order present in the liquid state .",
    "we shall find good agreement of our numerical results with this work , but none with the kthn picture , or in the presence of disorder with the bragg glass scenario .",
    "a lot of numerical work has been done on clean systems , some indicating a first order 2d vortex melting transition @xcite @xcite and some failing to see any kind of phase transition @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the experimental evidence on superconducting films is also contradictory .",
    "whilst a first order 2d melting transition has never been observed , current - voltage measurements have provided some evidence for second order 2d melting @xcite as well as failing to provide evidence for any transition in other experiments @xcite .",

    "most of this experimental evidence is on transport phenomena in samples that have at least weak disorder or surface pinning due to crystal defects or impurities .",

    "is relevant .",
    "it is also vital for the whole picture of the mixed state .",
    "it has been suggested that the apparent second order freezing transition deduced from changes in vortex liquid viscosity or sample resistance may instead be due to an exponentially fast increase of the relaxation time scales at low temperatures.@xcite .",
    "this behavior , which our work confirms , indicates activated dynamics , in which the relaxational time scales increase exponentially with the correlation length .",
    "in this paper we present a numerical investigation into relaxational time scales of density correlations in the vortex liquid and diffusion time scales of the vortices in a thin film .",
    "a langevin dynamics simulation is used with a phenomenological ginzburg - landau hamiltonian . to simulate quenched random disorder , we add a gaussianly - distributed random contribution to the mean - field transition temperature in the hamiltonian .",
    "the equilibrium dynamics of the superconductor is investigated by measurements of the time scales of density correlation decay and vortex self - diffusion .",
    "we find that the time scales of the two different processes both show the same exponential growth with the translational correlation length in the system and are due to the same activated relaxation process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : tf ] we shall give a short summary of the background of the phenomenological ginzburg - landau theory on which our work is based .",
    "we then give a description of how we solve the time dependent ginzburg - landau equation numerically in section [ sec : ns ] .",
    "section [ sec : dc ] reports our work on the density correlations and their relaxation times , followed by section [ sec : sdc ] which reports on self - diffusion of the vortices . in section",

    "we base our simulation on a thin film superconductor with the following experimentally realizable two dimensional geometry .",
    "a thin film superconducting sphere of radius @xmath21 and thickness @xmath22 is placed in a radial magnetic field of magnitude @xmath23 which emerges from an infinitely long , thin solenoid whose end is at the center of the sphere .",
    "this system has been investigated numerically before , using monte carlo dynamics @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the reasons for our preference of this geometry to the more widely used geometry of a plane with periodic boundary conditions have been presented in detail by dodgson and moore @xcite .",
    "the main advantage is that the spherical geometry guarantees full translational symmetry , which periodic boundary conditions do not , while having the same thermodynamic limit .",
    "periodic boundary conditions impose an artificial pinning potential on the vortices which makes them unsuitable for investigating transport and dynamical phenomena .",
    "we assume that in a strong type ii superconductor where the magnetic penetration depth is larger than the coherence length of the superconducting wave function by orders of magnitude , fluctuations in the magnetic induction are negligible .",
    "flux quantization requires that the b field at the sphere be such that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the flux quantum and @xmath26 is the number of vortices .",
    "this fixes @xmath27 with the unit of length being @xmath28 , which is proportional to the nearest neighbor distance of vortices in the abrikosov lattice .",
    "we shall make the usual approximation of retaining only the lowest landau level ( lll ) .",
    "this is the approximation that abrikosov used to first describe the vortex lattice state at mean - field level @xcite .",
    "defining @xmath29 as the gauge invariant momentum operator , @xmath30 , the lll is the eigenspace of @xmath31 associated with its lowest eigenvalue @xmath32 .",
    "the lll approximation is traditionally believed to hold near the upper critical field @xmath0 . however , due to renormalization effects , it actually describes a large portion of the vortex liquid regime @xcite .    in spherical geometry an orthonormal basis of",

    "@xmath23 stands for the beta function , given for natural numbers n , m by @xmath36 the order parameter in the lll approximation can be expanded in the above basis set : @xmath37 where @xmath38 @xcite .",

    "then the part of the hamiltonian due to disorder can then be expressed @xmath60 where @xmath61 with @xmath62 a generalized hypergeometric function .",
    "this term of the hamiltonian limits our simulation in the case of disorder to a relatively small system size , as it requires finding and storing @xmath63 values of @xmath62 .",
    "however , as the correlation length is very much reduced by disorder , the effects of the finite system size are for the same @xmath64 much reduced compared with the non - disordered case .",

    "however , the finite time steps always lead to a certain small deviation from the correct distribution , which does not arise in a monte carlo algorithm @xcite .",
    "we have tested our simulation s static thermal averages for varying quantities like energy and entropy against monte carlo averages from the code used in ref .",
    "@xcite , and chose our time steps @xmath72 , which reduces deviations to less than 1.5% .",
    "the quenched disorder is self - averaging for the case of an infinite system . in a finite system though , the particular random choice of disorder will obviously influence the results . to reduce this effect we run the simulation between 10 and 20 times with different sets of random @xmath55 , and average over these different measurements .",
    "to investigate the extent of order and the time scales of fluctuations in the system , we compute the connected part of the density - density correlator .",
    "this correlator measures the correlations of the magnitude of the order parameter in space and time .",
    "the density - density correlator carries essentially the same information as the translational correlation function of the vortex positions @xcite . however , it is far easier to compute than the latter , because it does not involve finding the zeros of the order parameter ( see section [ sec : sdc ] ) .",
    "the density - density correlator is defined as    @xmath73    this correlator and its decay in time is most revealing in @xmath74 space if one is interested in the structure of the system .",
    "therefore its fourier transform is measured , normalized by the average density of the order parameter and for easier readability divided by its high temperature limit : @xmath75    to compute this quantity the concept of the fourier transform on a plane has to be adapted to the curved two dimensional space of the surface of a sphere .",
    "the fourier transform is an expansion of the correlation function in the complete orthonormal set of functions solving the free wave equation , which is in the plane the continuous set of functions @xmath76 .",
    "the equivalent set of functions in a spherical geometry is the discrete set of normalized spherical harmonics , @xmath77 . to a value of @xmath78",
    "corresponds @xmath79 . because the system is isotropic , the correlator in * k * space depends only on the magnitude of @xmath80 , i.e. only on @xmath78 and not on @xmath81 .",

    "however , in the disordered case there are permanent correlations due to the structure imposed on the vortices by the quenched disorder .",

    "the relaxation times are rather small in this regime and @xmath95 decays very quickly to zero .",
    "very near zero , however , noise dominates the data , so that in the worst cases we have to restrict our fits to the first two or three points of the curve .",
    "having defined @xmath107 from the exponential decay of the density - density correlator , it is an interesting observation that the time scales which arise from the exponential decay of the current correlator @xmath111 which we measured when determining the transverse conductivity @xcite are exactly the same .",

    "if these disclinations were crucial for the relaxation mechanism , one should expect the relaxation times to be larger in larger systems , where these defects are less concentrated .",
    "[ figure7 ] however shows excellent agreement of @xmath107 for systems different in size by more than a factor 3 .",
    "we observe that the typical length of moving chains increases with decreasing @xmath64 .",
    "this is easy to understand because the range of hexatic order @xmath149 determines the size of a tilt region .",
    "this pattern of fewer , large events of motion at low temperature and smaller , uncorrelated events at higher temperature is confirmed by our self - diffusion measurements , where it can be deduced from the statistical error in the self - diffusion coefficient ; if the simulation has been running for the same time in units of relaxation times , @xmath150=const .",
    ", at different @xmath64 , the vortices in the systems have diffused by the same amount but the error is clearly smaller at higher temperatures .",
    "the range of static correlations in the liquid determines the size of a tilt region and therefore the energy barrier height of the relaxation mechanism . to explain why the activation energy @xmath138 depends linearly on @xmath97 , we suggest the following scaling argument .",
    "consider a region of the vortex liquid with linear size @xmath97 .",
    "we want to estimate the energy it costs to tilt the core of the region , while the edges relax , as can be seen in fig.[figure9 ] , in order to keep best possible hexatic order with the static surroundings . over a distance @xmath97",
    "hexatic correlations from the middle of the region to the edges are only just noticeable",
    ". therefore the core of the region can not rotate freely .",
    "the angles which allow some hexatic alignment with the surroundings are discrete in steps of @xmath151 , where @xmath26 is the number of vortices on the edge on the region .",
    "the potential energies of the @xmath26 different orientations with respect to the minimum energy orientation will have a probability distribution @xmath152 with mean @xmath153 .",
    "a region of size @xmath97 is typically in a low energy state just locked to a given orientation by its surroundings .",
    "the locking energy , which is the lowest potential difference @xmath154 to one of the @xmath26 other orientations , denoted @xmath155 , is of order @xmath156 . by rotating",
    ", the system will jump from an initial low energy state to higher ones .",
    "from there , the rotated region and its surroundings relax to a new low energy state , which is is the process responsible for destruction of correlations .",
    "the intermediate `` barrier '' state after the rotation is one of the @xmath26 possible orientations , and its energy is a random energy from the distribution @xmath152 .",
    "we can write the typical activation energy as @xmath157 . from above",
    "we know that the typical lowest energy in a given sample @xmath158 . in order to find @xmath153 we can apply the well - known result that the minimum value of @xmath154 which occurs in a large random sample of size @xmath26 is on average @xmath159",
    "this result is shown to be valid for any finite probability distribution @xmath152 , @xmath160 with mean @xmath153 in ref . .",
    "we now know that @xmath161 .",
    "@xmath26 is essentially the region s perimeter and therefore @xmath162 , which yields @xmath163 , the scaling behavior observed in our measurements .",
    "we have analyzed the equilibrium dynamics of a thin film superconductor in the vortex liquid phase .",
    "we have shown that there is one main relaxation time scale which appears in the decay of density correlations of the order parameter as well as in the self - diffusion of the vortices .",
    "this time scale shows a linear exponential dependence on @xmath64 at all accessible temperatures .",
    "we have also described the effects of quenched random disorder on the density correlations and their decay .",
    "disorder induces permanent correlations and reduces the range of the non - permanent correlations and their relaxation times .",
    "the density correlations in a disordered system look very similar to those in a system without disorder at a higher temperature .",
    "this is in good agreement with non - perturbative analytical results @xcite .",
    "we find that both the pure and the disordered system have activated dynamics .",
    "the main time scale @xmath134 scales with the range of translational order @xmath97 like @xmath164 , where f depends on the strength of disorder .",
    "this indicates an activated relaxation process with an activation energy of the order @xmath165 .",
    "we have identified this process as a tilt in the hexagonal orientation of the vortex liquid over a region of linear extent @xmath97 .",
    "we have found no divergence of time scales or other features attributable to a phase transition at any finite temperature .",
    "our work does not confirm the existence of a vortex lattice phase at finite temperature , nor do we see a vortex glass or bragg glass phase in the disordered system .",
    "experimental results on time scales from ac transport measurement spectra in weakly disordered very films should provide information on the relaxation time scales found in our numerical work .",
    "such experiments have been performed , see for example refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the samples in thin film experiments are are often two dimensional only in the sense that their characteristic bending length of vortices is larger than the sample thickness , but not thin enough to obey 2d lll scaling",
    ". therefore they do not compare directly to our results .",
    "experiments similar to the ones from refs.@xcite and @xcite but in thinner films would be directly related to our results .",
    "experimental observation of self - diffusion would be far more difficult , if not impossible",
    ". decoration experiments , which use snap shots of the vortex liquid , have made detailed studies of static properties possible ( see e.g. @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "however , the analysis of the vortex dynamics with this technique remains difficult @xcite .",
