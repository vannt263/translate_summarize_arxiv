    "it has long been recognized @xcite , that standard candles constructed from long duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) would have several potential advantages over type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , the most important being high redshift detection . whereas detected sne ia are currently spectrally classifiable out to a maximum of @xmath8 with _ hst _",

    "@xcite ) , @xmath9 of grbs with known @xmath3 ( @xmath10 of @xmath11 ) already have measured redshifts @xmath12 .",
    "although there are diminishing returns for observations at higher redshifts  which primarily probe the matter - dominated regime  such measurements may be of great interest if the dark energy shows exotic time variation . in practice ,",
    "@xmath13 ( @xmath14 of @xmath15 ) grbs in the current sample of bursts with measured redshifts ( @xmath3 ) , jet break times ( @xmath16 ) , and peak energies ( @xmath1 ) , are in the redshift range @xmath17 , which is _ already _ comparable to the number of high - z sne ia discovered with _ hst _ @xcite .",
    "this regime is clearly important for constraining @xmath5 , @xmath6 , its possible time variation , and the transition redshift to the epoch of deceleration @xcite .",
    "in addition to high-@xmath3 detection , @xmath18rays penetrate dust , grb spectra @xcite are simpler than sne ia spectra , yielding potentially cleaner @xmath19-corrections @xcite , and with massive star progenitors @xcite , any long grb evolution would likely be orthogonal to that of sne ia , ensuring different systematics .",
    "grb standard candles could thus provide a useful independent check to cosmography with sne ia .",
    "previous attempts to constrain cosmological parameters with grb energetics @xcite were thwarted by what are now known as wide distributions in the isotropic equivalent energies ( @xmath20 ) and beaming - corrected energies ( @xmath0 ) , which span more than @xmath21 and @xmath22 orders of magnitude , respectively @xcite . in particular , the once - promising @xmath0 distribution @xcite , widened with the discovery of new low energy bursts ( e.g. 030329 ) . expanding upon the well known @xmath1@xmath20 `` amati '' relation @xcite , ghirlanda  recognized that many under - energetic bursts appeared softer in the rest - frame prompt @xmath18ray spectrum than those with higher @xmath0 , discovering the remarkable @xmath1@xmath0 `` ghirlanda '' relation @xcite , which can be cast as a power - law @xmath23 . in @xcite , we confirm this correlation ( fig .",
    "1a herein ) , and demonstrate that although the goodness of fit to a power - law is strongly sensitive to input assumptions ( particularly the circumburst density ) , the relation itself is still highly significant over a range of plausible cosmologies .",
    "as recently suggested @xcite , the relation could be used to create a standardized grb candle with an empirical correction to the energetics similar to the light - curve shape corrections used to standardize the peak magnitudes of sne ia @xcite . however , without knowing the slope of the power law _ a priori _ from physics or from a low-@xmath3 training set , in the cosmographic context , it is imperative to re - fit for the slope of the power law from the data for each cosmology @xcite ( fig .",

    "although the authors claim tight constraints on the matter density ( assuming flatness ) , they fail to self - consistently re - fit the slope of the relation for each cosmology and exclude several outlier bursts ( e.g. 990510 , 030226 ) on grounds not adequately justified .",
    "recently , those authors have improved upon these points in follow - up work @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors re - fit the relation self - consistently , but did not stress the cosmographic power of grbs alone , instead performing a joint fit with sne ia , claiming that the joint fit is more consistent with flatness than sne ia alone .",
    "however , the analysis in @xcite understresses the fact that grbs alone appear to favor a loitering cosmology @xcite ( although see @xcite ) .",
    "despite improvements , the most recent follow up work @xcite does not address the sensitivity to input assumptions @xcite .",
    "however , by performing simulations of future data @xcite , and developing new statistical techniques @xcite , the recent work had indicated some potentially exciting new directions for grb cosmology .",
    "although a major step forward , a grb standard candle constructed from the @xmath1@xmath0 relation can not yield meaningful constraints on the cosmological parameters for the current data , mainly due to the small sample ( with very few low-@xmath3 events ) and to the strong sensitivity of the goodness of fit of the relation to density assumptions .",
    "selection effects @xcite and other potential systematics @xcite must also be addressed before using grbs for precision cosmography . however , _ swift _ should detect @xmath46 grbs over the next @xmath22 years @xcite . of these",
    ", redshift constraints are expected for a majority of the bursts , either from the on - board broad - band spectroscopy or ground - based follow - up spectra . with early - time light curves from the _",
    "swift _ uvot instrument and a fleet of dozens of ground - based follow - up programs , @xmath16 could be measured for a substantial fraction of these bursts .",
    "unfortunately , future @xmath1 measurements may be hindered by the relatively narrow spectral range of _ swift _ ( [ 15,150 ] kev ) , further strengthening the science case for the ongoing symbiosis with _ hete ii _",
    ", due to its larger [ 30,400 ] kev bandpass .    even for a sample including an order of magnitude more grbs with measured @xmath3 , @xmath16 , and @xmath1 , we believe that density constraints will remain the limiting factor for cosmography , since each requires detailed broadband afterglow modeling ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "this is independent of a low-@xmath3 training set or a theoretical prediction that constrains the slope of the relation _ a priori_. future work",
    "will then require using the known information about the _ distribution _ of densities to marginalize over or sample statistically from such a distribution with monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "while the current data do not uniquely support a good fit for the relation to a power law , they certainly do not rule out one .",
    "as such , it is still possible that grb standard candles from this relation might place meaningful constraints on the cosmological parameters , most notably the time variation of the dark energy .",
    "however , even if the relation is never able to seriously constrain cosmology , with the beaming - corrected energy @xmath0 , it is more physically motivated than the amati relation @xcite ( also see @xcite ) , it may lend insight into grb radiation physics @xcite , and could help us to identify new classes of grbs (  different progenitors ) @xcite .",
    "independent of its ultimate fate as a potential grb standard candle , the discovery of the @xmath1@xmath0 ghirlanda relation @xcite clearly represents an exciting new direction for the grb field ."
