    "inter - particle correlations in the weakly repulsive dilute bose gas have been studied for more than half a century .",
    "it is therefore quite remarkable that the dependence of the bose - einstein condensation temperature ( @xmath3 ) on the interaction strength has continued to generate controversy until this time . in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of the longstanding @xmath3 problem starting from a quasiparticle picture of the system in the un - condensed ( high - temperature ) side .",
    "the model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the free - gas spectrum , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are bosonic operators . in principle",
    ", one is interested in any possible interaction function @xmath8 , but the simplest possible form is a delta function in real space , so that @xmath9 is momentum - independent .",
    "to first order @xmath10 is related to the @xmath11-wave scattering length @xmath1 by @xmath12 .",
    "a dimensionless measure of the interaction is the quantity @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the density .",
    "the program is to examine the shift in the critical temperature @xmath3 , as compared to a noninteracting gas of the same density , as a function of @xmath13 , for small @xmath13 .    for several decades",
    ", the quasiparticle picture has been a central paradigm for studying correlated many - body systems . even in a highly correlated bose liquid like liquid helium , a quasiparticle description accounts for the transition temperature extremely well ; e.g. , the lambda point temperature can be obtained from the ideal gas expression @xmath15^{2/3}\\rba n^{2/3}$ ] by replacing the helium atomic mass @xmath16 by a quasiparticle effective mass , @xmath16*. the effective mass in the liquid exceeds the bare mass , because of the inertia of the medium which has to make way for any atom to move . correspondingly , the transition temperature is lower for liquid @xmath17he than would be the case for an ideal bose gas with the same bare mass .",
    "the question we would like to address is the following : how much information can one get about @xmath3 from a quasiparticle description of the weakly interacting bose gas ?",
    "the simplest treatment , a hartree correction , does not give any contribution to the transition temperature .",
    "the exchange contribution at mean field level ( fock ) , does not have any effect on @xmath3 for a momentum - independent interaction , but gives a negative shift for a momentum - dependent interaction @xcite .",
    "the fock contribution to @xmath3 depends on the details of the interaction , and for small interactions is weaker than the leading shift we are examining .",
    "the present understanding is that there is no mean field effect on the leading shift , and that higher - order correlations are required to calculate this leading shift in @xmath3 .",
    "interaction effects in the non - ideal bose gas can be described in terms of the two - body @xmath18-matrix , i.e. , the vacuum scattering amplitude .",
    "this quantity describes all possible collisions between _ two _ particles , without taking into account the fact that the surrounding medium has an effect on these collisions .",
    "many - body corrections arising from the surrounding gas can be treated by using the many - body @xmath19-matrix , which is the sum of ladder diagrams .    in this paper , we approach the calculation of @xmath3 for a bose gas using perturbation theory in the two - body @xmath18-matrix .",
    "this is to be regarded as a first step toward a calculation using the many - body @xmath19-matrix .",
    "the idea is that , if one can regard the system as a weakly interacting gas of quasiparticles , then perturbation theory in the quasiparticle interactions should give a reasonable starting point , and the effects of the surrounding medium can be treated as a correction to these results .",
    "the work in this paper is not meant to be a definitive determination of @xmath3 for the weakly interacting bose gas , but instead pursues the more limited aim of calculating @xmath3 within a quasiparticle framework .",
    "as is typical for descriptions of critical - point properties , our approach faces infrared divergences .",
    "we elaborate on two ways to regularize these divergences .    during the past several years , work by baym , lalo and collaborators @xcite , has predicted a positive shift in @xmath3 which , to leading order , is _ linear _ in the scattering length ; @xmath20 .",
    "attempts to calculate the coefficient @xmath21 , however , have continued to give fluctuating results .",
    "this has prompted the baym group to predict @xcite a logarithmic contribution at the _ next _ order , i.e. , a @xmath22 contribution .",
    "the presence of such a non - analyticity might explain the difficulty in any numerical estimate of @xmath21 .",
    "stoof , from a renormalization - group analysis @xcite , has predicted an increase of the transition temperature proportional to @xmath23 , i.e. , a non - analyticity at _ leading _ order .",
    "a leading non - analytic behavior would actually explain even better the widely varying results obtained in attempts to calculate the coefficient @xmath21 based on the assumption of linear shift @xmath24 .",
    "one should also note that the work of baym and collaborators relies heavily on power - counting and dimensional arguments .",
    "this kind of argument typically does not catch logarithmic corrections .",
    "the possibility of leading non - analytic dependence of @xmath25 on the interaction , therefore , needs to be further examined .",
    "an older attack on the @xmath3 problem is that of kanno @xcite . using a `` quasi - linear '' canonical transformation , kanno calculated the free energy and hence @xmath3 of the bose gas .",
    "other derivations of the transition temperature include the canonical - ensemble calculation @xcite of wilkens _ et al _ leading to a negative shift , schakel s effective - action theory @xcite leading to a prediction for a positive linear shift , and kleinert s recent five - loop calculation @xcite .",
    "in addition , there have been spurious mean - field level predictions @xcite for shifts in @xmath3 proportional to the square root of the interaction .",
    "one could think of studying the @xmath3 problem experimentally , e.g. , in the context of trapped atomic bose gases .",
    "unfortunately , trap effects dominate in the dependence of @xmath3 on the interaction for these systems .",
    "size effects cause a decrease of @xmath3 at mean - field level , far larger than the intrinsic effect under study in this paper .",
    "the @xmath17he - vycor system @xcite might be more suitable for studying the @xmath3 problem , but is yet to reach the accuracies necessary for identifying logarithm - like corrections .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the expansion of the single particle green function to leading nontrivial order in quasiparticle interactions , namely : @xmath26 } { [ z - e_\\vk]^2 } ~+~ \\ldots   \\ , = \\frac{1}{z - e_\\vk }   \\lbc 1+\\int \\frac{d\\omega}{\\pi } \\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm i}(\\vk,\\o)}{(\\o -z)(\\o -e_\\vk ) } \\rbc + \\ldots   \\ , \\ , .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here @xmath27 are the real and imaginary parts of the self energy , and @xmath28 is the quasiparticle energy .",
    "this expression has a number of attractive properties which would not appear in simple perturbation theory in the inter - particle interactions .    in the quasi - particle approximation , the single - particle spectral function @xmath29 is given by : @xmath30 note that the form automatically satisfies the spectral sum - rule , @xmath31 .",
    "we proceed by writing the particle number @xmath32 as a momentum sum over the convolution of the spectral function and the bose thermal distribution function , @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34}{(\\o - e_\\vk)^2 } \\sigma_{\\rm i } ( \\vk,\\omega )    \\ , \\ , .\\ ] ]    to proceed further we must resort to an explicit expression for the self - energy .",
    "we make the assumption that our quasi - particles interact weakly , so that we can work perturbatively .",
    "we limit ourselves to terms up to second order in the interaction .     the two first - order and two second - order self - energy diagrams included in our calculation . of the six topologically distinct second - order diagrams , only the two shown here are necessary for momentum - independent interaction , because the other four can be obtained by 1st - order self - energy insertions in the first order diagrams.,width=226 ]      we first perform perturbation theory for the self - energy in the bare potential @xmath8 , retaining explicit momentum - dependence .",
    "the diagrams that need to be calculated are shown in figure [ fig_selfenergy12 ] .",
    "after performing the matsubara sums , we get : @xmath35 here @xmath36 . for a momentum - independent @xmath37 ,",
    "the first - order hartree and fock terms give equal contributions , as do the two second - order diagrams .",
    "however , using @xmath37 directly in causes ultraviolet ( uv ) problems in the second - order self - energy , due to the term with a single bose function .",
    "the prescription for removal of such divergences is to shift to a description in terms of the vacuum scattering amplitude @xmath18 , which is a more physical quantity than the bare potential .",
    "the bare potential @xmath8 is related to the @xmath18-matrix by @xmath38 when eq is used to replace the bare potential by the @xmath18-matrix in eq , we get an @xmath39 term from the first - order self - energy that exactly cancels the uv - divergent term appearing at second order",
    ". there is now no problem in using a low - momentum limit in which the @xmath18-matrix reduces to a momentum - independent constant @xmath40 .",
    "the real ( on - shell ) and imaginary parts of the self - energy now reduce to : @xmath41 and @xmath42      we will use and to define a self - consistent quasi - particle approximation , formally second order in the vacuum scattering amplitude .",
    "this is done by replacing the free - particle dispersion functions ( @xmath43 s ) on the right hand sides of , by the quasiparticle dispersions , @xmath44 s .",
    "the imaginary part now becomes @xmath45 when this expression for the imaginary part is used in eq , the @xmath46 contribution cancels out exactly , resulting in @xmath47 i.e. , the number of quasiparticles is equal to the number of particles .",
    "since we will be using these results above and at the transition , we have neglected the zero - momentum occupancy @xmath48 as compared to @xmath32 .",
    "we note that the imaginary part of the self - energy , i.e. , effects of quasiparticle broadening , has dropped out of the expression for particle number and hence does not play any role in our determination of the transition temperature .    finally ,",
    "making the real part of the self energy ( eq [ se_real ] ) self - consistent , we get the following expression for the quasi - particle energy : @xmath49",
    "to derive an expression for the change in the critical temperature due to quasi - particle interactions , we first consider the density of an ideal bose gas , both at its transition temperature @xmath50^{2/3}\\rba n^{2/3}$ ] , and at temperature @xmath3 which is the transition point of the _ interacting _ bose gas .",
    "@xmath51 here @xmath52 .",
    "we are looking for the difference of transition temperatures of an interacting and a non - interacting gas at the _ same density _ , therefore @xmath53 .",
    "evaluating at @xmath3 and subtracting equation we obtain the leading correction to @xmath54 due to interactions : @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the bose distribution function evaluated at the critical temperature ; and @xmath57 represents the single particle excitation spectrum at @xmath3 .",
    "the problem of calculating the relative shift has thus been reduced to calculating the spectrum at the critical point , @xmath58 .    at this stage , we are able to present a simple argument for the _ increase _ of @xmath3 due to the addition of a repulsive interaction .",
    "this is important in light of the continuing appearance of negative - shift predictions in the literature @xcite .",
    "the major contribution to eq comes from the infrared ; therefore approximately @xmath59   \\ , \\ , .\\ ] ] if the quasiparticle spectrum @xmath58 is `` harder '' than the bare spectrum @xmath60 , i.e. , if @xmath58 is sub - quadratic in @xmath61 or quadratic with an effective mass @xmath62 , then the @xmath63 integral dominates and the shift is positive . on the other hand",
    "if the spectrum at @xmath3 were `` softened '' by the interaction , one would have a decrease in the transition temperature .",
    "since the spectrum @xmath58 at @xmath3 is known to be intermediate between linear and quadratic , the weakly interacting bose gas has a _ positive _ shift in the transition temperature with the introduction of a weak repulsive interaction .",
    "it follows from that @xmath58 satisfies the nonlinear integral equation , @xmath64 in the perturbative quasiparticle approach , equations and completely determine @xmath25 .",
    "if the quasiparticle dispersion @xmath58 were quadratic at small momenta , the self - energy integral in eq would be divergent in the infrared .",
    "a power - counting of this equation shows that , for self - consistency , the dispersion at small momenta should be sub - quadratic , @xmath65 , modulo possible logarithmic factors which power - counting can not predict .",
    "the power - counting arguments were first devised by patashiskii and pokrovskii @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this approach using second - order perturbation theory over - modifies the infrared spectrum .",
    "the long - wavelength spectrum at the transition point should be @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the anomalous dimension .",
    "the present system falls in the same universality class as the @xmath68 quantum rotor model . for this universality class ,",
    "a recent monte carlo calculation @xcite has produced the value @xmath69 .",
    "in contrast , eq gives @xmath70 .",
    "acknowledging that the present framework over - modifies the spectrum at @xmath3 , we proceed to analyze eqs and in order to extract the shift in the critical temperature due to interactions .",
    "there are several ways of dealing with the infrared divergence .",
    "one is to treat equation self - consistently and determine the self - consistent @xmath71 numerically ; this procedure is outlined in section [ sect_selfcons ] .",
    "this approach has also been explored by baym and collaborators .    in the next section ,",
    "we take a different approach , motivated by the work of kanno @xcite .",
    "we make an expansion in @xmath72 that allows us to use the chemical potential at the critical point , @xmath73 , as an infrared cutoff .",
    "this approach allows us to express the relative shift in the transition temperature as an expansion in @xmath74 , which itself can in turn be related to the scattering length .",
    "this leads to a transition temperature shift @xmath25 that is @xmath75 to leading order , where @xmath76 is a function approximately like @xmath77 , to be specified in the next section .",
    "the appropriateness of this procedure is difficult to gauge , but it provides strong support to the possibility of non - analytic corrections to the transition temperature at leading order .    another infrared regularization procedure that has appeared in the literature is a.m.j .",
    "schakel s prescription of analytic continuation @xcite .",
    "the connection between schakel s treatment and other calculations awaits further study .",
    "approximation for eq .",
    "solid curve is exact numeric solution ; dashed curve shows approximation @xmath78 .",
    "inset shows comparison for the relative shift of @xmath3 ; solid curve is numeric solution and dashed curve is the @xmath79 approximation .",
    ", width=309 ]    we expand @xmath80 around @xmath81 : @xmath82 this provides us with an infrared cutoff , @xmath83 , for our integrals .",
    "the approximation is non - selfconsistent in the sense that a modification of the spectrum to a non - quadratic form no longer plays any role .",
    "using this expansion , the relative shift in @xmath3 becomes @xmath84 both integrals can be expanded in @xmath85 , as detailed in appendix [ nonself_appendcalc ] , each integral being @xmath86 at leading order .",
    "the result is @xmath87 the infrared cutoff needs to be expressed in terms of the scattering length ; this is achieved by using the condition for the transition , @xmath88 .",
    "the relation is @xmath89 also derived in appendix [ nonself_appendcalc ] .",
    "the functional dependence of @xmath85 on the scattering length is thus similar to @xmath90 , and therefore we get a shift approximately of the form @xmath91 .    the approximation of eq by @xmath78 is displayed in figure [ fig_nonself_betamu ] .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of involves a calculation of the ( sub - quadratic ) quasiparticle dispersion @xmath71 .",
    "the principal values in make it difficult to treat numerically .",
    "a `` high - temperature '' approximation , obtained by using @xmath92 , produces a simpler version without the zeroes of the principal value form : @xmath93 while the same dimensional arguments apply to , it is likely to lose information about logarithm - like factors .",
    "since the self - consistent spectrum has infrared behavior @xmath94 , we look for solutions of the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 is some smooth function that decays to zero for large @xmath97 , and is constant or logarithm - like at small @xmath97 .",

    "once @xmath71 has been computed for a particular @xmath105 , the relative shift in @xmath3 can be computed using our basic eq .",
    "the @xmath25 vs. @xmath1 plot in the inset shows a definite linear - like increase , as opposed to , say , a @xmath109 or @xmath110 dependence .",
    "however the existence , or lack thereof , of a logarithm - like factor is difficult to prove from numeric data .",
    "to summarize , we have outlined the calculation of @xmath3 from a perturbative expansion in the two - body @xmath18-matrix , or equivalently the scattering length @xmath1 .",
    "the transition temperature is expressed in terms of the quasiparticle spectrum at @xmath3 , and hence the problem is transformed to one of calculating the critical - point spectrum @xmath111 .    in developing the formalism , we find that the use of the two - body @xmath18-matrix removes the ultraviolet divergences that appear in a perturbative calculation in terms of a momentum - independent bare potential @xmath10 .",
    "we also find that the width of the quasiparticle peak ( @xmath46 ) does not affect @xmath3 . whether this is true at all orders , or a peculiarity of second - order , and whether this is true for a more accurate treatment in terms of the many - body @xmath19-matrix , remain open questions .",
    "the new feature of this work is an unusual approach to dealing with the infrared divergence that appears in treating the spectrum at @xmath3 .",
    "this regularization scheme bypasses the issue of spectrum modification , and results in a non - analytic ( @xmath112-like ) correction factor to the linear shift of the transition temperature .",
    "the major remaining issue in the @xmath3 problem seems to be the possible existence of a logarithm - like factor in the leading @xmath1-dependence .",
    "the resolution of this problem should lie in a clear treatment of the spectrum at @xmath3 .",
    "of the two major approaches , the perturbative approach alters the quadratic spectrum too strongly , while the rg calculation @xcite neglects spectrum alteration .",
    "the reason for perturbation theory over - estimating the spectrum modification remains to be examined in detail .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the reason is that perturbation in @xmath1 or @xmath18 does not take into account the fact that the effective interaction strength",
    "_ flows to zero _ under renormalization group flow , at the critical point .",
    "an alternate way to view this is to note that the many - body @xmath19-matrix ( sum of ladder diagrams ) vanishes @xcite at the transition temperature . a perturbative calculation in terms of the many - body @xmath19-matrix , as opposed to one in terms of the two - body @xmath18-matrix that we have considered here , may therefore be expected to give a more realistic modification of the quasiparticle spectrum at @xmath3 .",
    "a calculation of @xmath58 in terms of the many - body @xmath19-matrix has not yet appeared in the literature .",
