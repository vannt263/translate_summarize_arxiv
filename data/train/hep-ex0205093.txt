    "an intriguing variation on the grand unification theme that nucleons are likely to be unstable is the proposal that neutrons can oscillate into antineutrons .",
    "neutron - antineutron oscillations were first predicted in 1970 by v. a. kuzmin in a model intended as a realization of requirements given earlier by a.d .",
    "sakharov for evolution of the universe to net baryon asymmetry .",
    "subsequently @xmath0oscillations emerged as a predicted reaction in certain grand unification theories @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been shown that @xmath0oscillations can occur in a large class of supersymmetric @xmath5 models @xcite .",
    "in such models the dominant baryon number violating process is a @xmath6 nucleon transition ( e.g. @xmath0oscillations or p + n @xmath7 pions ) rather than a @xmath8 nucleon - antilepton transition ( e.g. p @xmath9 or p @xmath10 ) .",
    "neutron - antineutron oscillations have also been indicated as viable by recent gut models which invoke the existence of extra spacetime dimensions @xcite .    if indeed a neutron can evolve into an antineutron , the experimental signatures for the metamorphosis should be distinctive .",
    "the resulting antineutron will annihilate with a baryon of the surrounding environment , producing multiple mesons ( @xmath11 ) whose visible energy and net momentum are approximately those of two nucleon masses having nuclear fermi motion .    from the phenomenology of neutron - antineutron oscillations it can be shown @xcite that the oscillation time @xmath12 of a neutron bound within a nucleus of atomic mass @xmath13 is related to the neutron oscillation time in vacuum  according to    @xmath14    here @xmath15 , which has units of inverse time , is the suppression factor representing the effect of the nuclear environment which substantially prolongs the effective oscillation time .",
    "detailed calculations of the suppression factor @xmath15 for parent nuclei of experimental interest , including deuterium , oxygen , argon , and iron , have been reported in literature .",
    "the calculations utilize phenomenological frameworks provided by nuclear potential theory , and by s - matrix theory . in the analysis of dover , gal , and richard @xcite ,",
    "it is proposed that neutron - antineutron oscillations will occur mostly in outer nuclear shells and near the nuclear surface .",
    "however reservations concerning this picture have been expressed and in a number of calculations the entire nuclear volume contributes to @xmath0oscillations @xcite .",
    "two types of experiments have been used to search for neutron - antineutron oscillations . in one approach ,",
    "slow neutrons from a fission reactor are channeled through a magnetically shielded vacuum pipe towards a target region .",
    "an antineutron produced during the flight will annihilate in the target and the annihilation products are registered by detectors surrounding the target .",
    "experiments of this type have been carried out at pavia @xcite and at grenoble .",
    "the grenoble reactor experiment obtained @xmath16 s at 90% confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "this is the most stringent oscillation time lower limit reported to date using free neutrons .",
    "the alternate approach , used in this experiment , is to continuously monitor neutrons bound in nuclei , usually as part of an ongoing nucleon decay search .",

    "et al . _ for iron , frjus determined the free neutron limit to be also @xmath25 @xmath26 seconds at 90% cl @xcite .    in the kamiokande analysis an enhanced probability for @xmath0oscillations to occur in the nuclear periphery as postulated by dover _",
    "et al . _ was assumed . in the monte carlo simulations of the experiment ,",
    "the effect of this assumption is to reduce distortion of the final state meson spectrum arising from intranuclear absorption and inelastic scattering processes . as a result experimental detection efficiencies",

    "we have developed realistic simulations of @xmath0oscillations yielding annihilations as they would occur in the iron nuclei which comprise the bulk of the calorimeter mass .",
    "generation of events is carried out as follows :    momenta of the initial state antineutron and nucleon are assigned according to a distribution based upon a fermi - gas model parameterization of quasi - elastic electron nucleus scattering @xcite .",

    "events which passed the hardware trigger requirements were subjected to two different software  filter \" codes .",
    "the filters impose event containment criteria , e.g. that no track from the event approaches closer than 20 cm to the detector outer surfaces ; they also mitigate against backgrounds arising from cosmic ray muons , natural radioactivity , and detector noise .",
    "events which survived the filters were then subjected to two separate scans by physicists .",
    "scanning was carried out using interactive color graphics workstations .",
    "the scan rules provided refinements to the filter selections and introduced requirements on imaging quality , e.g. an event was rejected if ( _ i _ ) its primary vertex occurred in material interior to the detector but not instrumented , or if ( _ ii _ ) its proximity to inter - module gaps compromised the reconstruction of the event .",
    "events which survived successive application of the hardware trigger , software filters , and physicists scans are tallied in the upper four rows of table [ tbl : survival_rates ] for each of the three simulations .",

    "a shower prong on the other hand is created by photon conversion or by a primary electron or positron .",
    "the electromagnetic shower consists of many distinct particles and exhibits a cone - like pattern of hits , interspersed with gaps , which is aligned with the direction of the initiating photon or electron .",

    "that is , 28 neutrino - induced background events would occur in a 33.7 fiducial kiloton - year exposure to an atmospheric neutrino flux having null neutrino oscillations .",
    "however strong evidence for atmospheric neutrino oscillations now exists @xcite , @xcite , .",
    "we allow for neutrino oscillations in our background estimate by weighting our mc @xmath63  cc prediction by the atmospheric neutrino flavor ratio - of - ratios : @xmath73_{data}/[({\\mbox{$\\nu_{\\mu}$}}+ \\mbox{$\\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu}$})/ ( { \\mbox{$\\nu_{e}$}}+ \\mbox{$\\overline{\\nu}_{e}$})]_{mc}$ ] .",
    "we have used the value of @xmath74 measured in this experiment , based upon a 5.14 fiducial kton - year exposure : @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "this correction reduces the neutrino background sample to 24.5 events . after scaling to the data exposure and accounting for statistical error plus uncertainties arising from our atmospheric neutrino mc including the neutrino oscillation correction ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : errors_bkgrds ] ) , we obtain @xmath76 events as the estimated neutrino - induced background of our @xmath0oscillation search .    as discussed in sect .",

    "thus of the 188 shield - quiet data multiprongs , we estimate @xmath77 to be rock events .",
    "however , among the 375 shield - tagged rock multiprong events , only fifteen pass our four @xmath0selection criteria . thus , assuming that the selection efficiency of shield - quiet rock events is the same as that of shield - tagged rock events , the background of rock events which pass all @xmath0selections is estimated to be @xmath78 events .    in summary",
    ", we estimate the number of background events to be @xmath79 plus @xmath80 events .",
    "having observed five candidate @xmath0oscillation events and having calculated background neutrino and cosmic ray processes to contribute 4.5 events , we set a lower limit for the @xmath0oscillation time @xmath12 in iron nuclei .",
    "we follow previous experiments in using our best estimate of the background in determining the limit .",
    "additional uncertainties in the limit due to the uncertainties in the background calculation are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : stat_and_syst_errors ] .",
    "we use the approach to confidence level construction as formulated by feldman and cousins . for five candidate events with 4.5 background events the signal limit at 90% cl is @xmath81 events . the oscillation time lower limit",

    ". simulations of the second and third rows are regarded to be realistic ; the one with more conservative nuclear modelling ( bottom row ) is the basis for the limits for this search . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     a degree of caution is warranted when comparing oscillation time lower limits for free neutrons as calculated by underground experiments versus a reactor neutron beam experiment ( last column of table [ tbl : experiments_and_results ] ) .",
    "the limits of soudan 2 , frjus , and kamiokande are based upon values for the neutron suppression factor as calculated by dover _",

    "a new oscillation time lower limit for @xmath0oscillations in iron nuclei has been determined at 90% cl : @xmath88    assuming the suppression factor for iron is @xmath89  @xcite , the corresponding limit at 90% cl for n to @xmath90oscillations of free neutrons is @xmath91    the search reported here is background - limited .",
    "candidate events are observed to occur at a rate similar to that predicted for backgrounds .",
    "since the predominant background arises from kinematic overlap with multiprong reactions initiated by atmospheric neutrinos , it seems unlikely that future underground experiments can avoid also becoming background - limited in larger exposures .",
