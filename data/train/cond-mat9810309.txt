    "numerous physical systems that show continuous non - equilibrium phase transitions display near the transition point space - time structures that can be described by directed percolation clusters .",
    "well - known examples are epidemic processes without immunization  @xcite , poisoning of catalytic surfaces  @xcite , roughening transitions in growth processes  @xcite , schlgl s reaction models  @xcite , contact processes  @xcite and certain cellular automata  @xcite .",
    "the model known in particle physics as reggeon field theory  @xcite has also been related to directed percolation and epidemic processes  @xcite .",
    "all these systems share the property that their critical behaviour is characterized by the existence of an absorbing state .",
    "this property determines their universality class  @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of these systems near the transition point is characterized by universal quantities such as critical exponents .",
    "the exponents for directed percolation have been calculated to second order in @xmath2  @xcite and  numerically  for @xmath3 and @xmath4  ( for recent results see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is well - known from the theory of equilibrium critical phenomena that universality not only holds for critical exponents but also for certain amplitude ratios and scaling functions  @xcite .",
    "an example for a universal relationship between physical quantities near a critical point is the equation of state . in the present paper",
    "we derive an equation that describes the stationary state of epidemic processes with an absorbing state near the transition point .",
    "before we turn to the mesoscopic description used in the analysis presented below let us briefly discuss two examples for microscopic models that belong to the universality class of directed percolation .",
    "schlgl s autocatalytic reaction scheme  @xcite is defined by the reaction equations @xmath5 where the concentration of @xmath6 s and @xmath7 s is kept constant ( e.g. , by reservoirs ) . here",
    "two remarks are in order : ( i ) if @xmath8 ( i.e. , the particles are of the same type ) and their concentration is not kept constant ( but governed by the reaction - diffusion dynamics ) the system belongs to a different universality class . in that case the total particle density is conserved and affects the long - time dynamics of the system  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) only if the reaction @xmath9 has zero probability the system has an absorbing state . in the case of chemical systems",
    "it is natural to take this process into account since back reactions can in general not be avoided .",
    "thus the b - particles represent a source for x. below a critical value of the reaction rate @xmath10 the density of @xmath11-particles is nonvanishing in the stationary state for @xmath12 .",
    "in the theory of infectious diseases  @xcite one considers two types of individuals : susceptibles s who can catch the disease and infectives i who have the disease and can transmit it .",
    "the dynamics of the system is characterized by the following processes :    1 .",
    "healthy ( susceptible ) individuals may catch the disease by contact with infectives .",
    "infected individuals may recover spontaneously and thereby become susceptible again .",
    "2 .   interaction of infected individuals can lead to recovery ( `` saturation '' ) .",
    "3 .   diffusive spreading of the disease .",
    "4 .   susceptibles may catch the disease spontaneously .",
    "the process ( iv ) models for instance a continuos flow of germs into the system .",
    "note that the system has an absorbing state if ( and only if ) the process ( iv ) has zero probability .",
    "a mesoscopic description for the dynamics near the transition point requires a single density @xmath13 which represents the slow degrees of freedom . in the case of schlgl s model  ( [ schl ] )",
    "@xmath14 corresponds to the density of @xmath11-particles , in the context of poisoning of a catalytic surface @xmath14 is the density of vacant sites and in epidemic processes it represents the density of infectives .",

    "the system has an absorbing state with @xmath21 if the random force @xmath22 is multiplicative : @xmath23 where we have again neglected irrelevant higher powers in @xmath14 . in the case of the reaction - diffusion system  ( [ schl ] ) the ( constant ) source term @xmath24 vanishes for a zero reaction rate @xmath25 . by a simple rescaling it is possible to render the coupling constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 equal .",
