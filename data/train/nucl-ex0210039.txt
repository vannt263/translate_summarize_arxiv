    "the theoretical predictions in the nineteen sixties @xcite of the possible existence of very long - lived superheavy elements around z=114 and n=184 stirred a lot of excitement among the nuclear scientific community and have initiated the search for the possible existence of superheavy elements in nature . in the present paper we concentrate on two independent well established experimental results which are impossible to understand under the present common knowledge of nuclear physics .",
    "these puzzling data are first the observation , in mica minerals , of certain halos which have been attributed to the @xmath5-decay of the short - lived @xmath2po,@xmath3po and @xmath4po nuclei @xcite , and secondly the observation in several minerals of a low energy @xmath5-particle group with an energy of about 4.5 mev @xcite .",
    "halos in mica , which consist of tiny concentric rings , are known for a long time @xcite . for most of them",
    "the measured radii of the rings fit with the known ranges of the various @xmath5-particle groups from @xmath6u or @xmath7th decay chains .",
    "therefore they have been correctly interpreted , back in 1907 @xcite , as due to the existence of very small grains of @xmath6u or @xmath7th in the centers of the corresponding halos , which have been decaying , through their characteristic decay chains , since the time of crystallization of the crust of the earth .",
    "however , other types of halos have been discovered back in 1939 @xcite and have been thoroughly studied by gentry @xcite .",
    "these are the @xmath2po , @xmath3po and @xmath4po halos which consist of respective one , two and three concentric rings , with radii equal to the ranges of the @xmath5-particle groups from the decay chains of the corresponding po isotopes .",
    "these po isotopes belong to the @xmath6u decay chain .",
    "however , their half - lives , as well as the half - lives of their @xmath1-decay parents , are short , and since rings belonging to their long - lived precursors are absent , their appearance in nature is puzzling @xcite .",
    "another puzzling phenomenon is the low - energy @xmath5-particle group , around 4.5 mev , which has been seen in molybdenite @xcite , in thorite @xcite , in magnetite @xcite and in osir @xcite .",
    "the cleanest spectrum , where this group appears without observed residues from u isotopes decays , was obtained by cherdyntsev et al .",
    "@xcite . based on chemical behavior ( having volatile oxides ) of the @xmath5-emitter",
    ", it has been suggested that it might be due to a decay of an isotope of eka - os , the superheavy element with z=108 ( hs ) . since it was usually found together with @xmath8 cm and @xmath9pu ,",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that this low - energy @xmath5-particle group is due to an isotope of element 108 which is a precursor of @xmath8 cm and its descendant @xmath9pu .",
    "the half - life of this activity has been estimated to be around @xmath10 y @xcite .    with the current common knowledge of nuclear physics it seemed impossible to understand these data .",
    "the predicted energies of ground state to ground state @xmath5 transitions for @xmath1 stable hs nuclei with atomic masses of 274 to 286 are between 9.5 and 6.7 mev @xcite , and the predicted half - lives for these energies are between @xmath11 s and @xmath12 y @xcite , as compared to half - life of about @xmath13 y for 4.5 mev .",
    "the question is why the nucleus decays with such a low energy @xmath5-particle when a much higher energy , with a penetrability factor of at least 14 orders of magnitude higher , is available .",
    "a second question is how the nucleus can decay with about eight orders of magnitude shorter lifetime than what is predicted @xcite from energy versus lifetime relationships for a normal 4.5 mev @xmath5-transition ( experimentally estimated @xmath14 as compared to predicted @xmath13 y ) .",
    "( a lifetime in the region of @xmath15 y is certainly impossible , since it implies the existence of about 100 mg of material in the studied samples ) .    in the following paragraphs similar effects seen in the study of various actinide fractions",
    "@xcite produced via secondary reactions @xcite , and also in the study of the @xmath16o+@xmath17au @xcite and the @xmath18si+@xmath19ta @xcite heavy ion reactions , are summarized .",
    "based on the results of all these experiments , a consistent interpretation for the puzzling phenomena seen in nature is suggested .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "in a study of actinide fractions from a w target which had been irradiated with 24-gev protons , long - lived isomeric states were found in the neutron - deficient @xmath20am and @xmath20bk nuclei with respective half - lives of 0.6  y and @xmath2130 d @xcite .",
    "their character however was not clear , being far from closed shell nuclei , where high spin isomers are known , and living much longer than the known fission isomers .",
    "in addition , several unidentified @xmath5-particle groups were found in some actinide sources .",
    "thus , 5.14 mev ( t@xmath22 = 3.8@xmath231 y ) , 5.27 mev ( t@xmath22 = 625@xmath2384 d ) and 5.53 mev ( t@xmath22 = 26@xmath237 d ) groups were respectively found in the bk , es and lr - no sources @xcite ( see fig . 1 and table i ) . similar to the situation with the 4.5 mev group seen in nature , also here in the case of the latter unidentified groups , one can not understand their relatively low energies ( e.g. , 5.53 mev in lr - no as compared to typical g.s . to g.s . transitions of around 8 mev ( column 6 of table i ) , which have about 11 orders of magnitude larger penetrability factors ( the ratio of column 4 to column 7 in table i ) ) , and their very enhanced character , having 10@xmath24 - 10@xmath25 shorter half - lives than predicted from the systematics of energy versus half - life relationship for normal @xmath5-decays @xcite ( see column 5 in table i ) .",

    ", long - lived proton radioactivities with half - lives of about 5.8 h and 67.3 h have been discovered .",

    "figure 6d shows the results when the projectile has a deformation which is typical for the second minimum of the potential .",

    "@xcite shows that for z=108 , e@xmath93 of about 4.5 mev corresponds to n@xmath86162 ( see fig .",
    "this is consistent with the suggestion @xcite that @xmath8 cm may be a descendent of the superheavy element with z=108 which decays by the 4.5 mev @xmath5-particles , since @xmath8 cm can be obtained from @xmath94hs@xmath95 by successive six @xmath5-decays .",
    "another possibility is that the long - lived isotope is @xmath96hs which decays by two @xmath58 or electron capture decays to @xmath96sg which then follows by five successive @xmath5-decays to @xmath8 cm .",
    "it should however be mentioned that in principle the above 4.5 mev @xmath5-particles may also be due to a strongly retarded ii@xmath50@xmath30i@xmath50 or iii@xmath50@xmath30ii@xmath50 transition in the region of os itself .",
    "( for normal 4.5 mev @xmath5-particles in os the expected @xcite half - life is about 1 y. such short - lived nuclide can not exist in nature ) .",
    "it was shown that the newly discovered long - lived super- and hyper - deformed isomeric states can provide consistent interpretations to two previously unexplained phenomena seen in nature .",
    "thus , the po halos can be understood as due to the existence of such isomeric states in nuclei with z values around 84 and atomic masses in the region of 210 - 218 .",
    "the observed 4.5 mev @xmath5-particle group can be understood as due to a low energy and strongly enhanced hyperdeformed to hyperdeformed transition in a nucleus with z = 108 and a @xmath64 271 .",
    "it seems to us that the existence of superheavy elements in nature is not impossible .",
    "we appreciate very much the valuable discussions with j. l. weil and n. zeldes .",
