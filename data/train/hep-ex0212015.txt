    ", @xmath11 is the momentum carried by the hadron @xmath7 , and @xmath12 is the centre - of - mass energy of the annihilation process with total hadronic cross - section @xmath13 . ignoring polarisation effects the fragmentation function receives contributions from the transverse ( @xmath14 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath15 ) polarization states of the intermediate electroweak vector bosons , @xmath16 and z@xmath17 , and from their interference yielding an asymmetric contribution ( @xmath18 ) @xcite . at centre - of - mass energies much larger than the mass of the produced quark @xmath19 , the longitudinal contribution is negligible @xcite .",
    "a sizeable contribution to the longitudinal fragmentation function comes from gluon radiation from the @xmath20 system in the final state @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric contribution vanishes , because we do nt distinguisch quark and antiquark .",
    "the fragmentation functions are related to the perturbatively calculable ratios of the longitudinal , @xmath21 , and transverse , @xmath22 , cross - sections to the total cross - section .",

    "even though the shape of the momentum spectra can not be calculated for the complete phase space , sound predictions have been made for the shape and the energy evolution of the @xmath44 distribution @xcite .",
    "destructive interference for soft gluon emission suppresses the production of particles with very low momentum thus turning the @xmath45 distribution into an approximate gaussian shape at asymptotic energies @xcite .",
