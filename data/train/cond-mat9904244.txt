    "the interest devoted to the three - band hubbard model@xcite is due to the fact that it describes the charge properties of a cuo@xmath0 layer , like those found in the high-@xmath1 superconducting cuprates , while still being comparatively simple.@xcite the basic assumption which leads to the three - band hubbard model is that the only relevant orbitals are the cu @xmath2 and the o @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals .",

    "( [ 3-band2 ] ) .",
    "let us introduce appropriate fluctuation operators @xmath60 .",
    "first , operator @xmath41 from eq .",
    "( [ plaqf1 ] ) is generalized to all @xmath61 cu sites @xmath9 @xmath62 where the sum is over the four o sites @xmath11 which surround cu site @xmath9 .",
    "the remaining operators are constructed in accordance with the following principles : ( i ) all operators describe delocalizations of a hole initially located at cu site @xmath9 .",
    "( ii ) the final site in the process is reached via the shortest path accessible by cu - o hopping processes .",
    "( iii ) a summation over all equivalent final sites is taken .",
    "( iv ) the signs of the hopping processes are chosen to be the negative of the phases @xmath63 in hamiltonian  ( [ 3-band3])(which guarantees non - negative values for the fluctuation strengths @xmath37 ) .",
    "= 0.2    figure  1 shows final sites reached by fluctuation operators @xmath64 , @xmath65 . for reasons of symmetry only a quarter of the allowed fluctuation range",
    "fluctuation @xmath66 , for instance , describes the hopping of the hole from cu site @xmath9 , via o site @xmath11 , to the four nearest - neighbor cu sites @xmath67 @xmath68 final states with singly or doubly occupied cu sites differ by the coulomb energy @xmath17 . since @xmath17 is large we have to distinguish between these two cases .",
    "therefore we split @xmath66 into two operators which describe a process leading to a singly or doubly occupied cu site , respectively @xmath69 note that it is not necessary to introduce a fluctuation operator which leads to the nearest neighbor cu sites in diagonal direction ( e.g. the cu site without a label in fig .  1 ) .",
    "due to the pauli principle fluctuations to these sites are largely excluded because of antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the neglect of fluctuations leading beyond the range shown in fig .  1 will be justified _ a posteriori_.",
    "it will be shown that the fluctuation strengths @xmath37 decrease rapidly with increasing length of the fluctuation processes .    according to eq .",
    "( [ groundstate1 ] ) the ground state has the following form @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the @xmath72 fluctuation operators described above .",

    "( [ groundstate2 ] ) we approximately factorize the exponential function with respect to the fluctuations @xmath73 @xmath74 this approximation amounts to the assumption that far - reaching fluctuations @xmath75 occur on the background of @xmath73-fluctuations which in turn are influenced only indirectly ( i.e. via @xmath46 ) by the former . the second exponential function in eq .  ( [ groundstate3 ] ) exactly factorizes with respect to @xmath76 @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ groundstate4 ] ) every hole may fluctuate over a total range of five plaquettes each .",
    "notice that all holes fluctuate simultaneously .",
    "this leads to a multitude of many - body effects , i.e. the fluctuation of a hole depends on the configuration of other holes .",
    "basically there are three types of many body effects which are exemplified in fig .",
    "2 . first , due to the pauli principle the fluctuation of a hole may be blocked by the presence of other holes with the same spin , as in the fluctuation process labelled ( a ) in fig .  2 .",
    "second , there are processes in which holes with the same spin change place , cf . process ( b ) . in the following",
    "we will call these processes _ site - changing processes_. third , there are strong correlations due to the hubbard @xmath17 on doubly occupied cu sites , as in process ( c ) .",
    "one common feature of all these many - body effects is that they suppress fluctuations .",
    "= 0.2    this multitude of many - body effects makes an exact evaluation of expectation values using eq .",
    "( [ groundstate4 ] ) impossible .",
    "further approximations are therefore necessary .",
    "let us consider processes in which two or more holes simultaneously leave their original plaquette .",
    "the fluctuation strengths @xmath78 for such far - reaching fluctuations turn out to be small compared to @xmath46",
    ". therefore it should be possible to neglect the many - body effects arising in these processes ( except for site - changing processes in diagonal direction , see below ) .",
    "in the case of @xmath79 fluctuations , for example , we neglect the possibility that the o site @xmath11 between the cu starting and final sites @xmath9 and @xmath67 may already be occupied by a hole with the same spin .",
    "this amounts to the following simplification @xmath80 in this way all of the aforementioned processes are included , some of them however only in a simplified way ( i.e.  by neglecting many - body effects ) .",
    "in addition to all many - body effects which are due to processes where only one hole leaves its original plaquette , we furthermore take account of all site - changing processes in diagonal direction , see fig .",
    "the suppression of charge fluctuations due to the diagonal sites turns out to be of great importance . on the other hand ,",
    "site - changing processes involving next - nearest cu neighbors in horizontal or vertical direction can be neglected for the following reason : during these processes the paths of the holes have to cross at the intermediate o sites ( i.e. sites 1 and 4 in fig .  1 )",
    ". however , since the holes have the same spin , they have to avoid each other due to the pauli principle .",
    "site - changing processes in horizontal or vertical direction are therefore unlikely .",
    "we now evaluate expectation values with state  ( [ groundstate4 ] ) . using the above approximations the norm of this state is @xmath81 , where @xmath61 is the number of cu sites and , in generalization of eq .",
    "( [ plaqnorm ] ) @xmath82 @xmath83 is the number of equivalent final sites of the given process ( e.g.  @xmath84 ) , and @xmath85 is the probability that the configuration of the other holes makes the process possible . this probability is defined by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a projection operator on all configurations which allow for process @xmath71 .",
    "for example , @xmath88 projects on states in which the target cu site of fluctuation @xmath89 is empty , whereas @xmath90 is the projector on states with a singly occupied final site . due to translational symmetry",
    "the probabilities @xmath85 do not depend on the site index @xmath9 .",
    "obviously , eqs .",

    "( [ explicitprobabilities ] ) is straightforward .",
    "@xmath95 holds since we assume that far - reaching fluctuations occur on the background of @xmath73-fluctuations .",
    "@xmath96 is the probability to find a given hole at its original cu site .",
    "@xmath97 is therefore the probability that a target cu site is singly occupied .",
    "this is a necessary prerequisite for the fluctuation process @xmath98 which leads to a double occupancy , cf .",
    "@xmath92 , on the other hand , is the probability that a target cu site is empty , as required for fluctuation process @xmath99 .",

    "no significant delocalization beyond the nearest neighbor plaquette occurs .",
    "a similar observation is made when other model - parameter values are chosen within the range which is relevant for cuprate compounds .",
    "these results retrospectively justify the neglect of far - reaching fluctuations and many - body effects .",
    "notice , however , that the neglect of many - body effects allows for unphysical fluctuations which may decrease the calculated ground - state energy below the exact value .",

    "we have neglected many - body effects in processes in which two holes simultaneously leave their original plaquette .",

    "<S> for the calculation of charge excitations as those observed in , e.g. , photo - emission spectroscopy or in electron - energy loss spectroscopy , a correct description of ground - state charge properties is essential . in strongly correlated systems like the undoped cuprates this is a highly non - trivial problem . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we derive a non - perturbative analytical approximation for the ground state of the three - band hubbard model on an infinite , half filled cuo@xmath0 plane . by comparison with projector quantum monte carlo calculations </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the resulting expressions correctly describe the charge properties of the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> relations to other approaches are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical ground state preserves size consistency and can be generalized for other geometries , while still being both easy to interpret and to evaluate .    2 </S>"
