    "the concept of photon as the quanta of the electromagnetic field dates back to the beginning of this century . in order to explain the spectrum of black - body radiation",
    ", planck postulated the process of emission and absorption of radiation by atoms occurs discontinuously in quanta , i.e. , the emission of black - body was energy quantization with value of @xmath7 @xcite , in 1905 , einstein had arrived at a more drastic interpretation . from a statistical analysis of the planck radiation law and from the energetics of the photoelectric effect he concluded that it was not merely the atomic mechanism of emission and absorption of radiation which is quantized , but that electromagnetic radiation itself consists of photons .",
    "the compton effect confirmed this interpretation .",
    "the foundations of a systematic quantum theory of field were laid by dirac in 1927 . from the quantization of the electromagnetic field one",
    "is naturally led to the quantization of any classical field , the quanta of the field being particles with well - defined properties .",
    "we have successfully quantized the free dirac electron , we would like to discuss the question of coupling the dirac electron to a spin - one maxwell field .",
    "the resulting theory had been called quantum electrodynamics , namely qed . over the past decades , the quantum electrodynamics ( qed )",
    "has attracted a considerable scientific attention @xcite .",
    "as we have already stated , qed is an abelian gauge theory , which based on a @xmath8 gauge symmetry . in 1954 ,",
    "yang and mills @xcite extended the gauge principle to non - abelian gauge symmetry , which based not on the simple one - dimensional group @xmath8 of electrodynamics , but on a three - dimensional group , the group @xmath0 of isotopic spin conservation , in the hope that this would become a theory of the strong interactions . in particular , because the gauge group was non - abelian there was a self - interaction of the gauge bosons , and the @xmath8 abelian gauge theory there was not a self - interaction .",
    "entanglement @xcite is a unique feature of quantum theory having no analogue in classical physics .",
    "spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) has been used as a source of entangled photon pairs for more than two decades @xcite and provides an efficient way to generate non - classical states of light for fundamental tests of nature @xcite , for quantum information processing @xcite or for quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "entanglement between two photons emitted by spdc can occur in one or several possible degrees of freedom of light @xcite , namely polarization , transverse momentum and energy . at present , the two - photon , three - photon and multi - photon entanglement have been observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "the photon entanglement is from photon self - interaction and the interaction among photons . in order to study the photon entanglement ,",
    "we have extended the abelian qed to the non - abelian qed , which can describe the photon self - interaction and the interaction among photons .    in this paper , we have proposed @xmath0 non - abelian electromagnetism gauge theory . in the theory ,",
    "photon has self - interaction and interaction , which can explain photon entanglement phenomenon in quantum information .",
    "otherwise , we find there are three kinds photons @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and they have electric charge @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , which are accordance with some experiment results .",
    "in quantum theory , qed is an abelian gauge theory .",
    "it is instructive to show that the theory ban be derived by the dirac free electron theory to be gauge invariant and renormalizable .",
    "consider the lagrangian for a free electron field @xmath9 @xmath10 the dirac fields @xmath9 and @xmath11 under the @xmath8 local gauge transformations @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a real number .",
    "the derivative term will now have a rather complicated transformation @xmath14 the second tern spoils the invariance .",
    "we need to form a gauge - covariant derivative @xmath15 , to replace @xmath16 , and @xmath17 will have the simple transformation @xmath18^{\\prime - i\\alpha(x)}d_{\\mu } \\psi(x),\\label{4}\\ ] ] so that the combination @xmath19 is gauge invariant . in other words ,",
    "the action of the covariant derivative on the field will not change the transformation property of the field .",
    "this can be realized if we enlarge the theory with a new vector field @xmath20 , the gauge field , and form the covariant derivative as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a free parameter which we eventually will identify with electric charge .",
    "then the transformation law for the covariant derivative ( [ 4 ] ) will be satisfied if the gauge field @xmath20 has the transformation @xmath23 form ( [ 1 ] ) we now have @xmath24 defining gauge field tensor @xmath25 as @xmath26 under a transformation ( [ 6 ] ) , the field tensor @xmath25 is invariant , and we can structure the lagrangian of @xmath8 gauge field @xmath27 under a transformations ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) , the invariant total lagrangian of qed is @xmath28 the following features of ( [ 10 ] ) should be noted(1 ) the photon is massless because a @xmath29 term is not gauge invariant and not included in ( [ 10]).(2 ) the lagrangian of ( [ 10 ] ) does not have a gauge field self - interaction .",
    "in 1954 , yang and mills extended the gauge principle to non - abelian symmetry , it is @xmath0 transformation group of isotopic spin . in order to study the photon entanglement , we have extended the abelian qed to the non - abelian qed . in the following , we shall study electromagnetism interaction with the @xmath0 gauge theory . we know",
    "electrons and positrons with the same mass and opposite charges which obey the same equation .",
    "the dirac equation must therefore admit a new symmetry corresponding to the interchange particle and antiparticle .",
