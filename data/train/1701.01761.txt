    "as is well known , lepton flavor is an accidental conserved quantity in standard model ( sm ) with strictly massless neutrinos .",
    "for example , a muon never decays radiatively into an electron plus a photon and neutrinos do not oscillate in sm .",
    "however various experiments have now established firmly that neutrinos do oscillate from one flavor to another .",
    "the common wisdom , motivated by the physics of @xmath0 oscillation in the kaon system , is to give tiny masses with small mass differences to the various light neutrino species .",
    "radiative decay of the muon into electron is then possible but with an unobservable rate highly suppressed with the minuscule neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "searches for lepton flavor violating rare processes in high intensity experiments are thus important for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the most updated limit on @xmath1 is from meg experiment  @xcite [ megcurrent ] b(e ) 4.2 10 ^ -13 ( 90% c.l . ) , and its projected improvement  @xcite is [ megprojected ] b(e ) ~4 10 ^ -14 .",
    "recent data from t2k experiment  @xcite agrees well with the global analysis of neutrino oscillation data  @xcite , suggesting that the normal neutrino mass hierarchy ( nh ) with a cp violating dirac phase @xmath2 is slightly preferred .",
    "the best fit result for the central values of the pmns matrix elements in the normal neutrino mass hierarchy can be extracted from  @xcite u^nh_pmns = (    ccc 0.8251 & 0.5453 & 0.08679 + 0.1195 i + -0.4568 + 0.0670 i & 0.5854 + 0.04428 i & 0.6649 + 0.3171 + 0.07377 i & -0.5963 + 0.04875 i & 0.7322    ) .",
    "[ upmnsbestfits ]    for the @xmath3 conversion in nuclei , the present experimental upper limits on the branching ratios were obtained by sindrum ii experiment  @xcite for the targets titanium and gold , [ sindrum2ti ] b(^- + ti e^- + ti ) & < & 4.3 10 ^ -12 ( 90 % c.l . ) , + [ sindrum2au ] b(^- + au e^- + au ) & < & 7 10 ^ -13 ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "significant improvements are expected for @xmath3 conversion at future experiments like mu2e at fermilab in us and comet at j - parc in japan . projected",
    "sensitivities of @xmath3 conversion are  @xcite [ cometmu2eprojected ] b(^- + al e^- + al ) & < & 3 10 ^ -17 , + [ mu2eiiprismprojected ] b(^- + ti e^- + ti ) & < & 10 ^ -18 .",
    "a positive signal of any of the above processes ( or any process with charged lepton flavor violation ( clfv ) ) at the current or projected sensitivities of various high intensity experiments would be a clear indication of new physics as well , just like neutrino oscillations .",
    "given the fact that no new physics has showed up yet at the high energy frontier of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , it is not a surprise that many recent works have been focused on new physics implication of clfv in the high intensity frontier .",
    "for a review on this topics and its possible connection with the muon anomaly , see  @xcite and references therein .    in a recent work  @xcite , we updated a previous calculation  @xcite for the radiative process @xmath4 in the mirror fermion model with electroweak scale non - sterile right - handed neutrinos   to an extended version  @xcite where a horizontal @xmath5 symmetry in the lepton sector was imposed . in this work",
    "we extend this previous analysis  @xcite to the @xmath3 conversion in nuclei , in particular for aluminum , gold and titanium .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , after presenting some highlights of the crucial features of the extended mirror fermion model , the calculation of @xmath6 conversion in the model is presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we derive a simple relation between the @xmath7 conversion rate and the radiative decay rate of @xmath8 in the limit of zero momentum transfer and large mirror lepton masses .",
    "numerical results are shown in sec .",
    "we summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] . in appendix",
    "a , we briefly review the effective lagrangian  @xcite for describing @xmath7 conversion ; and in appendix b , we collect some useful formulas used in sec .",
    "in this section , we first provide some highlights for the original mirror fermion model  @xcite and its @xmath5 extension @xcite .",
    "then we compute the effective coupling constants induced at one loop level in the extended model for the @xmath7 conversion .        the motivation of introducing mirror fermions in  @xcite was manifold .",
    "first of all , it is aesthetically satisfactory to have parity restoration at a higher energy scale while the maximal parity violating interaction ( v@xmath9a interaction ) in sm can be emerged from spontaneous symmetry breaking . this is one of the main reasons for various left - right symmetric models in the literature  @xcite .",
    "secondly , it is important to study non - perturbative effects in sm by discretizing it on the lattice .",
    "however it is well known that putting chiral fermion on the lattice is plagued by fermion doubling - an unavoidable consequence of the no - go theorem proved by nielsen and ninomiya  @xcite .",
    "sophisticated techniques like using wilson fermion , ginsparg - wilson fermion , staggered fermion , or domain wall fermion _ etc .",
    "_ , which by violating at least one of the assumptions in the no - go theorem to get rid of the unwanted species , are often employed to handle this problem in practice . for new physics model builders , it is attractive to add mirror fermions to the sm which makes the theory becomes vector - like at a higher scale and hence one can avoid the fermion doubling problem if formulating on the lattice .",
    "chiral gauge anomalies will then be cancelled automatically in this class of models .",
    "the third motivation is the electroweak scale non - sterile right - handed neutrinos introduced in  @xcite . for each generation",
    ", the right - handed neutrino is introduced together with a right - handed heavy charged fermion partner to form a sm su(2 ) doublet .",
    "similarly a left - handed heavy mirror charged lepton will be introduced for each right - handed sm charged lepton .",
    "majorana masses can then be given to these right - handed neutrinos via the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a higgs triplet with hypercharge @xmath10 with mass at the electroweak scale , rather than the grand unification scale in the usual scheme .",
    "tiny dirac masses can also be given via small vevs of higgs singlets with @xmath11 .",
    "this is the electroweak scale see - saw mechanism in mirror fermion model which is testable at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the original model in  @xcite has been shown to be consistent with electroweak precision test data  @xcite as well as the 125 gev higgs data from the lhc with an additional mirror higgs doublet  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the original model was extended with a horizontal @xmath5 symmetry imposed in the lepton sector to address various issues of lepton mixings .",
    "we briefly review this @xmath5 extension in the next subsection .",
    "the particle content of leptons and bosons of the model are shown in table  [ particlecontent ] .",
    "the fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the mirrors of the sm lepton doublet @xmath14 and singlet @xmath15 respectively for the @xmath16-th generation . for the scalars , @xmath17 is the mirror higgs doublet of @xmath18 introduced in  @xcite ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the georgi - machacek triplets  @xcite ; and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are singlets introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 assignments of these particles are listed at the second row in table  [ particlecontent ] .",
