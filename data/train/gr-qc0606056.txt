    "there has been tremendous interest over the last several years in the brane - world scenario where we are assumed to be living on a four - dimensional hypersurface ( brane ) in a higher - dimensional spacetime ( bulk ) @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of this scenario is proposed by randall and sundrum where there is a brane embedded in a five - dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime @xcite .",
    "they showed that the four - dimensional gravity is recovered at low energies , because gravity is confined to a single positive - tension brane even if the extra dimension is not compact .",
    "therefore , in order to see the deviation from the conventional four - dimensional gravity , it is necessary to investigate the phenomena occurred at high energies .",
    "one of the most promising tools to extract the information of the extra - dimension is the primordial density fluctuations generated in the period of inflation in the early universe . in the inflation model where inflation is driven by an inflaton field confined to the brane",
    ", the amplitude of the curvature perturbation is calculated in the extremely slow - roll limit where the coupling between inflaton field fluctuation and bulk perturbations can be neglected @xcite .",
    "this work is proceeded to go beyond the zero - th order slow - roll approximation by solving the bulk metric perturbations classically @xcite .",
    "it is shown that we could have significant effects from the back - reaction due to the coupling to five - dimensional gravitational perturbations .",
    "on the other hand , it was pointed out that the localized matter on a brane can induce gravity on the brane via quantum loop corrections at high energies @xcite .",
    "this induced gravity can act as the ultra - violet cut - off for the inflaton perturbations .",
    "based on the induced gravity scenario , dvali , gabadadze , and porrati ( dgp ) proposed a brane - world model with induced gravity @xcite in which the four - dimensional brane is embedded in a five - dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "( for a review of the phenomenology of dgp model , see @xcite . ) in the presence of the induced gravity , according to the embedding of the brane in the bulk , there appear two branches of background solutions . in @xmath4 branch ,",
    "the size of the four - dimensional hypersurface becomes minimum at the brane while , in @xmath7 branch , it becomes maximum at the brane .",
    "inflation models in this scenario were studied in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the behavior of five - dimensional metric perturbations excited by the inflaton perturbations confined to the brane in dgp model .",
    "the solutions in @xmath7 branch are regarded as the high energy limit of the randall - sundrum model including the curvature corrections on a brane , depending on the parameters .",
    "then our analysis can be used to discuss the generation of primordial fluctuations in these models . the solutions in @xmath4 branch",
    "are largely used to explain the present cosmic acceleration without introducing dark energy in the dgp model @xcite , but it turns out that they are plagued by the ghost instability @xcite . however , the study of the gravitational property of this model in the presence of matter and cosmic expansion is still very limited @xcite so it is also worth considering the solutions in this branch .",
    "the structure of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we derive the basic equations for the five - dimensional metric perturbation and the boundary condition imposed at the brane and then summarize the solution for the vacuum brane obtained in @xcite . in section iii , we provide the solutions for curvature perturbations on the brane in the presence of the scalar field on the brane .",

    "in addition , we consider the last term , an intrinsic curvature term on the brane which plays a crucial role in this model . here , @xmath15 is the four - dimensional gravitational constant .",
    "we define a crossover scale @xmath16 as @xmath17    we are interested in the gravitational property of this model in a cosmological setting . by assuming the flat friedmann - robertson - walker metric on the brane and neglecting the effect from the five - dimensional weyl tensor in the background ,",

    "<S> , we confirm that the lineariaed gravity on the brane is well described by the brans - dicke theory with @xmath8 in @xmath7 branch and @xmath9 in @xmath4 branch , respectively , which confirms the existence of the ghost in @xmath4 branch . </S>",
