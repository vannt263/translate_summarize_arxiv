    "<S> an _ ansatz _ which reads @xmath1 $ ] is introduced and the regions for the best choice of the parameters are studied .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been expected that a new state of matter , namely , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) can be formed in the relativistic heavy - ion collision . </S>",
    "<S> many signatures of the formation of qgp , such as @xmath2 suppression , strangeness enhancement , thermal dilepton and electromagnetic radiation etc . have been suggested @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a lot of them have been found in recent experiments as pointed by cern collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> however whether qgp has been got is still an open question , because many signatures suggested can also be explained by other treatments @xcite . to search </S>",
    "<S> an unambiguous signature is an essential task for the study of qgp . due to this reason , </S>",
    "<S> the strangelets , the strange quark matter ( sqm ) in finite lumps , have attracted much attention in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> greiner and his coworkers @xcite argued that strangelets might be produced in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions and could serve as an unambiguous signature for the formation of qgp .    since the speculation of witten @xcite that the strange quark matter ( sqm ) would be more stable than the normal nuclear matter and nuclei , many models including mit bag model @xcite , quark - meson coupling model @xcite , quark mass - density dependent model ( qmdd ) @xcite , friedberg - lee model @xcite , chiral su(3 ) quark model @xcite and etc . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have been employed to predict the behavior of sqm in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> it is of interest to investigate whether above models which are successful for bulky strange matter can be used to describe strangelets .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper evolves from an attempt to study this problem for the qmdd model . </S>",
    "<S> this model can provide a dynamical description of the confinement mechanism and explain the stability of sqm successfully via the suggestion of a density dependent masses for u , d and s quarks . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a difficulty emerges if the qmdd  model is used to describe strangelets at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of strangelet decreases as the temperature increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is of course unreasonable . </S>",
    "<S> since the mass of hadrons is observed to be dependent on temperature , we extend the qmdd model to a quark mass density- and temperature - dependent ( qmdtd ) model , and show that after a suitable choice of the adjusted parameters in the function of @xmath3 , the radius of the strangelet increases with the rise of temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> according to the qmdd model , the masses of u , d quarks and strange quarks ( and the corresponding anti - quarks ) are given by @xcite    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the baryon number density , @xmath6 is the current mass of the strange quark and @xmath0 is the vacuum energy density inside the bag .    </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic potential is    @xmath7    where @xmath8 stands for @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) and the electron @xmath11(@xmath12 ) , @xmath13 is the corresponding chemical potential . since the masses of quarks depend on density , the thermodynamic potential @xmath14 is not only a function of temperature , volume and chemical potential , but also of density . how to treat the thermodynamics with density - dependent particle masses </S>",
    "<S> self - consistently is a serious problem and has made many wrangles in the references @xcite . here after we follow the treatment of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the number density @xmath15 , the total pressure @xmath16 and the total energy density @xmath17 are given by    @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20    respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the baryon number density @xmath5 reads    @xmath21    the conditions of charge neutrality and chemical equilibrium are @xmath22    now we are in a position to use the above formulation to investigate the strangelets . </S>",
    "<S> instead of one of plane wave , the density of states @xmath23 for a sphere with radius @xmath24 is needed in our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> it was given by a multi - reflection theory @xcite    @xmath25 ,   \\label{10}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 for quarks and antiquarks , @xmath27 for @xmath11 and @xmath12.the second term on the right hand side of eq.([10 ] ) corresponds to the surface contribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown @xcite    @xmath28    this term is zero for massless quarks . the third term on the right hand side of eq.([10 ] ) comes from curvature of the bag surface . </S>",
    "<S> it can not be obtained by the multi - reflection theory directly except for two limiting cases @xmath29 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> madsen proposed@xcite    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath31    this simple form agrees to the above mentioned two values in the corresponding limits .    for the strangelets , </S>",
    "<S> the stability condition reads    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the total free energy . and </S>",
    "<S> it can be given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total energy , @xmath36    \\label{13 - 2}\\ ] ] is the entropy , @xmath37 is the distributing function of fermions and @xmath8 stands for @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) quarks and the electron @xmath11(@xmath12 ) . substituting eqs.([10 ] ) , ( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 12 ] ) into eq.([3 ] ) and using eq.([13 ] ) , we can obtain the stable radius @xmath24 of the strangelet , which is a function of temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the curves for @xmath33 per baryon number @xmath38 vs. @xmath24 of qmdd  model at zero temperature and at @xmath39 @xmath40 are shown in fig.1 by solid line and dashed line , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath38 , @xmath0 , @xmath41are chosen as @xmath42 it is clear that the radius for minimum @xmath33 decreases as temperature increases . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence on radius @xmath24 is displayed in fig.2 , in which it can be seen that @xmath43 is a monotonously decreasing function . </S>",
    "<S> this is of course unreasonable because the bag is expected to expand as the increase of temperature .    to understand this result physically , </S>",
    "<S> let us recall what happens for the masses of nucleons and mesons when temperature increases . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the effective masses of nucleons , effective masses and screening masses of mesons , are all dependent on temperature @xcite.we can sum the tadpole diagrams and the exchange diagrams for nucleons , the vacuum polarization diagrams for mesons by thermo field dynamics and find that the masses of nucleons and mesons all decrease as temperature increases . </S>",
    "<S> this result for @xmath44meson is in agreement with recent experiments@xcite . according to the constituent quark model , the nucleon </S>",
    "<S> is constructed by three quarks and the meson by two quarks . </S>",
    "<S> this means that to satisfy quark model we must consider the temperature dependence of the quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> but this effect has not been taken into account in eqs.([1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) if @xmath0 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we come to a conclusion that the unphysical result of qmdd model in studying strangelets comes from the assumption that @xmath45 is temperature independent .    although it is possible to find the function @xmath3 from a calculations of the vacuum energy , but in this paper , instead of the vacuum energy calculation , we study this problem more generally by introducing an _ ansatz _ , namely    @xmath46 ,   \\label{15}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 , @xmath48 are two adjust parameters , and @xmath49 is the critical temperature of the quark deconfinement phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the reasons for our choice are : first , the calculation of @xmath50 are model - dependent and the results given by different model are very different @xcite@xcite ; secondly , almost all previous calculations are based on mit bag model , but now we discuss the qmdd model . </S>",
    "<S> in fact we can imagine that the eq.([15 ] ) is the temperature expansion of @xmath0 in the low temperature regions . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath0 is zero when @xmath51 , a condition @xmath52 is imposed and only one parameter @xmath47 can be adjusted .    introducing eqs.([15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) , we extend the qmdd  model to a quark mass density- and temperature- model(qmdtd ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our model obtained by substituting eqs.([15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) into eqs.([1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) are shown in figs.(1 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4).the @xmath53 vs. stable @xmath24 curve for @xmath54 , @xmath55 given by qmdtd model is shown in fig.(1 ) by dot line . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the value of stable radius increases from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , but decreases to @xmath58 for qmdd model as shown by dashed - line .    the value of parameter @xmath47 can affect the result significantly </S>",
    "<S> . the range of possible @xmath47 is determined by physical constraints . </S>",
    "<S> for example , there are at least two physical constraints : ( 1 ) , the stable radius @xmath24 should increase with temperature ; ( 2 ) , the energy per baryon @xmath59 increases with temperature also . to show the importance of first constraint , we plot the @xmath60 curves for @xmath61 @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 in fig.(3 ) , respectively . we see that @xmath43 becomes a monotonously increasing function in the regions @xmath67 when @xmath47 @xmath68 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath59 vs. @xmath69 curves for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath66 , @xmath65 , @xmath63 are shown in fig.(4 ) to investigate the relevance of the second constraint . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath59 vs. @xmath69 curves becomes monotonously increasing function in the same temperature region when @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the best values for parameter @xmath47 are in the range    @xmath73    in summary , in order to overcome the difficulty related to the reduction of @xmath74 with @xmath69 , we suggested a qmdtd model . </S>",
    "<S> an ansatz for the temperature dependence of vacuum energy @xmath0 ( eq.([15 ] ) ) was introduced . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the parameters @xmath47 must lies in the range @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> our model can be used to study strangelet , in addition it can also be employed to address systematically the properties of sqm in bulk .    </S>",
