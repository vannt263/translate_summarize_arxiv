    "the unique band structure of graphene has brought the possibility of developing devices based on different degrees of freedom , other than charge ( electronics ) and spin ( spintronics ) , namely , using its different pseudo - spin states ( pseudo - spintronics ) and electronic valleys ( valleytronics ) .",
    "valley filtering in graphene has been pursued by many researchers , as a path to use the valley degree of freedom of electrons in this material as the basis for future valley - tronics .",
    "previous theoretical proposals for valley filtering demand a high control of the atomic structure of the graphene layer , either by cutting it in specific directions as to produce uniform zigzag edges @xcite , or by applying stress in a specific manner in order to obtain an almost uniform pseudo - magnetic field @xcite , or even by taking advantage of the valley filtering process that occurs when an electron propagates through a line of heptagon - pentagon defects on the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "monolayer graphene is gapless and therefore it poses problems to use it in some electronic devices@xcite . in bilayer graphene on the other hand ,",
    "a gap may be opened by applying a bias between the two layers @xcite .",
    "therefore , in bilayer graphene , it is possible to produce electrostatic confined structures , such as quantum wires , dots and rings @xcite .",
    "a special case of quantum wire confinement occurs when one applies opposite bias on the different sides of the quantum wire potential : in this case , one dimensional uni - directional chiral states are created , whose subband structures along the free direction for @xmath0 and @xmath1 valleys are mirror symmetric @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will use the latter property to propose a novel valley filter , which is solely based on the use of electrostatic potentials and we do not require any complicated tailoring of the graphene lattice as needed in previous proposed filters . although previous works @xcite have already studied the energy bands and chirality of these one - dimensional states created in bilayer graphene by electrostatic lateral confinement structures , it is important to investigate how to optimize the valley polarization efficiency that comes from the valley asymmetry of the bilayer graphene band structure observed for the different cones @xmath0 and @xmath1 in this system .    in this paper , we demonstrate that a quantum point contact ( qpc ) defined by electrostatic gates in bilayer graphene , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) , exhibits steps in its transmission probabilities as the energy of the incident electron increases , just like in an ordinary point contact . on the other hand , valley",
    "polarized current is predicted when the sides of the point contact have opposite bias , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) .",
    "the specific conditions for such polarization are discussed in detail in sec .",

    "[ sec.results ] and we summarize our discussion giving the main conclusions in sec . [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we present the theoretical tools for the carrier time evolution in bilayer graphene . in order to do so , we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the tight - binding hamiltonian of bilayer graphene in order to investigate the time evolution of a wave packet describing an electron propagating through a quantum point contact .",
    "the time evolution of a quantum state is described by the time - dependent schrdinger equation given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is known as the time evolution operator . for the case",
    "in which the hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time , this operator can be written as @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "different techniques to expand this exponential operator are found in the literature , for example iterative methods based on the crank - nicholson scheme and the chebyschev polynomials method .",
    "furthermore , for systems with moderate space dimensions there is the possibility to solve this problem by brute force , using full diagonalisation @xcite . here , we opted for the split - operator technique because of its elegance and its advantages : ( i ) solving time - dependent schrdinger equation in this way is fast and much easier than using e. g. green s functions techniques , ( ii ) results obtained by these approaches , while still physically meaningful and correct , are more pedagogical for the understanding of transport properties in quantum systems , as this method allows one , for instance , to track the center of mass trajectories , see reflection patterns and investigate valley - polarization by taking fourier transform of the wave packet at each time step ( this even makes it possible to study time - dependent valley scattering).@xcite    our approach is based on the tight - binding model for the description of an electron in bilayer graphene .",
    "we consider respectively @xmath5 and @xmath6 as the row and column indexes to locate a particular site in the lattice , and @xmath7 index corresponds to bottom and top layers , respectively .",
    "the basis vector state is defined as @xmath8 .",
    "so , the tight - binding hamiltonian reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the intra- and inter - layer hopping energies between the sites , respectively .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian for bilayer graphene in matrix form is now represented by two pentadiagonal matrices in blocks , connected by two diagonal matrices . to numerically simplify the problem , which is important",
    "when dealing with large systems , we first rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq.htb_bi ] ) as follows @xmath12 where the operators @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are defined as @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18    in doing so , we split the hamiltonian and thus transform the problem of pentadiagonal matrices in blocks into a series of calculations involving only products of tridiagonal matrices , which are much easier to handle with known computational routines .",
    "subsequently , the time evolution operator is expanded as follows @xmath19 and we neglect terms of order @xmath20 which correspond to the non - commutativity between the operators @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "higher accuracy is realised by considering a smaller time step .",

    "we propagate a gaussian wave packet following this numerical procedure and calculate the transmission probability by integrating the squared modulus of the wave packet only in the region of the bilayer after the qpc .",
    "the initial gaussian wave packet is defined as : @xmath42 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the pseudospinor are related to the probability of finding the electron in each triangular sublattice @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the graphene lattice in a given layer . for the bilayer case ,",
    "we choose the same pseudospinor for both layers , since the total wave function is composed of two gaussian wave packets , one in each layer , with the same properties , as initial momentum , initial energy and initial position of gaussian center @xmath45 in real space .",
    "the pseudospinor is characterised by the pseudospin polarization angle @xmath46 , such as @xmath47 .",
    "thus the pseudospin polarization has a conceptual connection with the direction of propagation of the wave packet in the tight - binding model and the choice of the angle @xmath46 depends also on which dirac valley the initial wave packet is taken@xcite . we take @xmath48(@xmath49 ) for an initial wave packet starting from @xmath0(@xmath1 ) valley , since we want it to propagate in the @xmath50-direction .",
    "the initial wave vector is @xmath51 , which is shifted with respect to the dirac points , where @xmath52 represents the two non - equivalent @xmath0 and @xmath1 points that are located at @xmath53 , with @xmath54 nm being the in plane inter - atomic distance . for our numerical calculations ,",
    "the initial wave packet energy @xmath55 is set by the modulus of the wave vector @xmath56 , since the bottom of the low - energy bands may be approximated by@xcite @xmath57 , in bilayer graphene , where @xmath58 ev is the interlayer coupling corresponding to perpendicular hopping between the bernal stacked layers and @xmath59 m@xmath60s is the fermi velocity .",
    "the width of the gaussian wave packet was taken as @xmath61 nm and its initial position as @xmath62 nm . if the wave packet width in ( @xmath63- ) @xmath56-space is ( small ) large , it will be composed of a distribution of plane - waves with different velocities and , therefore , exhibit a strong decay in time , due to the parabolic dispersion in @xmath56-space .",
    "we have checked that the wave packet width in real space considered in our calculations is appropriate for the proposed problem , being large enough to avoid significant changes of the wave packet within the time scale of interest .",
    "an important remark concerning the wave packet dynamics is about the oscillatory behavior of the velocity , _ i.e_. the zitterbewegung manifestation on the wave packet motion @xcite .",
    "we shall show that it can not be avoided for motion of an electron in bilayer graphene that propagates in the @xmath50-direction . to understand how this affects the velocity in the @xmath50-direction",
    ", we use the dirac hamiltonian for electrons in bilayer graphene in the vicinity of the @xmath0 point@xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the momentum operators in cartesian coordinates , and calculate the commutator @xmath67 $ ] . according to the heisenberg picture ,",

    "( [ eq.vy.bi ] ) and using the well - known commutation relation @xmath70 = i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}$ ] we find @xmath71    now we shall verify whether @xmath72 is a constant of motion or not , and if there is any situation where the velocity is not affected by the zitterbewegung in the @xmath50-direction . evaluating @xmath67 $ ] by making use of eqs .",
    "( [ eq.hd ] ) and ( [ eq.vy.bi.final ] ) , one obtains @xmath73 = \\left(\\begin{tabular}{cccc } $ -2iv^2_fp_x$ & $ 0 $ & $ 0 $ & $ -i\\tau_{\\bot}v_f$\\\\ $ 0 $ & $ 2iv^2_fp_x$ & $ i\\tau_{\\bot}v_f$ & $ 0$\\\\ $ 0 $ & $ i\\tau_{\\bot}v_f$ & $ 2iv^2_fp_x$ & $ 0$\\\\ $ -i\\tau_{\\bot}v_f$ & $ 0 $ & $ 0 $ & $ -2iv^2_fp_x$ \\end{tabular } \\right),\\ ] ] suggesting that even if @xmath74 , one has @xmath67\\neq 0 $ ] , implying that @xmath75 is not a constant of motion , because we are still left with non - zero off - diagonal terms .",
    "conversely , in the monolayer case , we obtain that the velocity in the @xmath50-direction is expressed by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the @xmath50 pauli matrix and with the monolayer hamiltonian being @xmath78 .",
    "following the same procedure as for bilayer graphene , we obtain @xmath79 = \\left(\\begin{tabular}{cc } $ -2iv^2_fp_x$ & $ 0$\\\\ $ 0 $ & $ 2iv^2_fp_x$\\end{tabular } \\right),\\ ] ] and thus @xmath80 = 0 $ ] if @xmath74 . therefore",
    ", there is no way to avoid the trembling motion at small times for the wave packet propagation in bilayer graphene - even for motion in the @xmath50-direction , _",
    "i. e. _ @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the wave packet will also move in the @xmath63-direction .",
    "for this reason , all presented results in this paper are normalized to the maximum transmission obtained for the case in the absence of any potential .",
    "in order to better understand our tight - binding results , let us first investigate the energy dispersions in a blg quantum wire defined by aligned ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) ) and anti - aligned ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) ) potential barriers , as obtained by the dirac approximation for blg , using the 4@xmath834 hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite these spectra are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) and [ fig : fig2](b ) , respectively , for different values of well width . only states with energy below the barrier height ( @xmath84 mev ) are shown .",
    "notice the qualitative difference between the two spectra .",
    "the energy dispersion in the former case exhibits symmetry with respect to positive and negative values of the wave vector in the propagation direction @xmath85 .",
    "as the propagation velocity is obtained from @xmath86 , with @xmath87 , this spectrum suggests that wave packets may propagate towards either positive or negative @xmath50-direction , provided the average wave vector @xmath85 of the wave packet is in a region of positive or negative derivative of the spectrum , respectively . on the other hand , the spectra for the anti - aligned case does not exhibit the same symmetry . besides",
    ", low energy electrons in this system can only exhibit positive velocity of propagation , since the derivative of the spectrum around @xmath88 is positive for any value of @xmath85 .",
    "in fact , this spectrum is obtained for the blg dirac hamiltonian for electrons around the @xmath0 point of the first brillouin zone .",
    "the spectrum for @xmath1 is obtained just by replacing @xmath85 by @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) , or , equivalently by inverting the polarization of all gates in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) .",
    "thus , although the band structures in @xmath0 and @xmath1 valleys are different , they are still mirror - matched .    due to the fact that the low energy spectra for the aligned bias case in @xmath0 and @xmath1 points have the @xmath90 and @xmath91 symmetries , the transmission probabilities are the same no matter if the wave packet started in @xmath0 or @xmath1 valley .",
    "this is verified in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , which shows the transmission probability as a function of the wave packet energy , for different configurations of the channel defined by aligned potentials , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) . results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 valleys in this case are exactly the same .",
    "steps are observed in the transmission probabilities as the wave packet energy increases .",
    "this is a well known feature of any qpc , which is related to the existence of quantized energy levels inside the channel - whenever the energy crosses one of the energy levels , a step is produced . in fact , although not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we verified that increasing @xmath92 moves the steps to lower @xmath55 , just as expected for an usual qpc , once that the energy of the quantized states of the channel decreases as @xmath92 increases .",
    "the figure shows that as @xmath93 varies the position of the step does not change , but for smaller @xmath93 , the steps are less pronounced .",
    "similar features are observed in the anti - aligned case , though with a fundamental difference - results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in this case are very different , as one can verify by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) and [ fig : fig4](b ) , respectively .",
    "this is a clear manifestation of the lack of inter - valley symmetry exhibited by the band structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) .",
    "such a difference between transmission probabilities in different valleys suggests the use of this system as a valley filter .",
    "however , in order to do so , we should seek for the best configuration of the system that enhances valley polarization .",
    "figure [ fig : fig5 ] shows the transmission probabilities ( upper panels ) and the valley polarization ( lower panels ) for the anti - aligned system of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) as a function of the bias potential @xmath94 , for different values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , considering a wave packet energy @xmath95 mev .",
    "once the wave packet is initially injected in the lowest subband of the energy spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) , then we limit ourselves to the lowest qpc steps .",
    "valley polarization is defined as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the transmission probability for a wave packet starting at the @xmath98 dirac points , so that @xmath99 ( 0 ) means a wave packet completely ( un)polarized in @xmath0 after the qpc .",
    "transmission probabilities in all cases are reduced as @xmath94 increases , which is expected , since the existence of a barrier leads to stronger reflection of the tails of the wave packet that are outside the channel region .",
    "a very weak oscillation is observed in each curve , which is due to an interference related to the path difference between electrons that go straight through the channel and those that are reflected at the exit and entrance of the channel .",
    "results in figs . [",
    "fig : fig5 ] ( b , d , f ) show a polarization that increases up to @xmath100 for higher values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , in particular for small @xmath92 . for larger @xmath92 , however , the electron starts to see a larger unbiased area in the channel , thus reducing the polarization effect .",
    "this polarization reduction for large @xmath92 becomes even more significant for wave packets with higher energy .",
    "indeed , extra energy bands with higher energy appear as @xmath92 increases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) , blue dotted curves ) . these bands exhibit states with negative velocities , which , consequently , harness the polarization effect proposed here , which relies on bands with a single direction of the propagation velocity .",
    "the results in fig . [ fig : fig4 ] demonstrate that as the initial energy of the wave packet @xmath55 increases , higher transmission probabilities are reached for wave packets starting in both valleys ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and thus a suppression of the polarization effect is expected in this case , which is due to the low screening of the packet by the barriers for a fixed range of bias potential .",
    "it is also clear that increasing the channel length improves the valley polarization .",
    "as already mentioned , even such almost perfect polarization for large @xmath93 can be destroyed by increasing @xmath92 .",
    "this is clarified in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , which shows transmission probabilities ( upper panels ) and polarization ( lower panels ) as a function of the well width @xmath92 in an anti - aligned qpc . in the case of @xmath101 nm (",
    "dotted blue line ) , polarization stays around @xmath102 for smaller @xmath92 , but starts to decrease for @xmath103 nm and @xmath104 nm , in the cases of @xmath105 mev and @xmath106 mev , respectively .",
    "although all the presented results in this paper were obtained for a circular gaussian wave packet that propagates straight through the gated constriction and whose center of mass position is located initially at the middle of the @xmath63-axis , it is worth to mention about the robustness of the polarization results when these conditions are not met . results for an elliptic gaussian wave packet , with larger width in the @xmath63-direction , as well as for wave packets propagating with non - zero angle with respect to the @xmath50-axis , have been obtained too , although only discussed here in a qualitative way in what follows .",
    "the elliptic case shows quite similar qualitative features , so that the polarizations are kept practically the same , especially in the range of most efficient polarization .",
    "for instance , considering @xmath107 ev , @xmath108 nm and @xmath95 mev , we found that making the wave packet @xmath109 larger in the @xmath63-direction would lead to a maximum difference of @xmath110 for intermediate values of polarization , whereas in the range of most efficient polarization , it shows no significant change . for a much larger channel width @xmath111 nm and considering such larger wave packet ,",
    "changes in polarization are not larger than @xmath112 . on the other hand ,",
    "the transmission probabilities for each valley decreases , since a larger part of the wave packet is reflected by the biased ( gapped ) regions of the system in this case .",
    "also , the packets along different propagation angles or different axis would , of course , be largely reflected by the potential barriers .",
    "the filtering efficiency , however , depends only on the ratio between transmission probabilities in @xmath0 and @xmath1 valleys ; details of the wave packet , such as its width , would not significantly modify this result , since they would change the transmission probabilities for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 almost in the same way , keeping the ratio and , consequently , the filtering efficiency , practically unchanged .    in summary ,",
    "our results demonstrate that an almost perfect valley filtering can be realised , provided ( i ) the electron energy is sufficiently low , ( ii ) the channel length is sufficiently long , and ( iii ) the channel width is narrow enough .",
    "we calculated the transmission probabilities of a gaussian wave packet through a quantum point contact defined by electrostatic gates in bilayer graphene .",
    "our results demonstrate that , if one uses the energy gaps introduced by a bias between upper and lower layers in order to define the channel in the point contact , transmission plateaus are observed as the energy of the packet increases , which reflects the discrete eigenstate spectrum in the channel , just like in a conventional qpc . on the other hand , if the bias in the left and right sides of the channel are opposite to each other , although still forming the same energy gap at both sides , a special situation of energy dispersion is obtained , where electrons in each valley have only one possible direction of propagation . in this case , the qpc works as an efficient valley filter , where valley polarization may reach @xmath113 with increasing gate potential .",
    "such a valley filtering device can have an important impact on future graphene valley - tronics , as it can be relatively easily achieved just by depositing electrostatic gates on graphene@xcite , with no need either to control edge types , or to produce strain or non - zero mass regions , in contrast to the valley filters previously proposed in the literature .",
