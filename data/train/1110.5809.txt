    "the utility of type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ; see filippenko 1997 for a review of sn spectral classification ) as cosmological probes depends on the degree of our understanding of sn  ia physics , and on various systematic effects such as cosmic chemical evolution .",
    "there is increasing evidence showing that even the so - called `` branch - normal '' sne  ia ( branch et al .",
    "1993 ) exhibit diversity in their spectral features and light - curve shapes that do not correlate with light - curve parameters such as the decline rate ( phillips 1993 ; benetti et al . 2005 ; branch et al . 2009 ; wang et al .",
    "2009a ; zhang et al .",
    "2010 ; hflich et al .",
    "for example , it has been recently shown that sne  ia having the same light - curve shape parameter such as @xmath2 ( phillips 1993 ) but faster expanding ejecta are on average @xmath9 mag redder in @xmath10 color near maximum light ( wang et al . 2009a , hereafter w09a ) .",
    "possible origins of such a color difference include a change of the dust obscuring the sn ( e.g. , circumstellar dust versus interstellar dust ; w09a ) , an effect of line blanketing ( foley & kasen 2011 ) , or a projection effect in an asymmetric explosion ( maeda et al . 2011 )",
    ". moreover , the peak luminosity of sne  ia seems to show an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their host galaxies : events of the same light - curve shape and color may be @xmath9 mag brighter in massive ( presumably metal - rich ) host galaxies ( kelly et al .",
    "2010 ; sullivan et al .",
    "2010 ; lampeitl et al .",
    "this correlation might also indicate variations in the explosion physics and/or differences of the progenitors in a range of environments .",
    "ultraviolet ( uv ) observations are of particular importance in understanding both the diversity of sne  ia and their physical evolution from low to high redshifts . in conjunction with existing optical and near - infrared data , uv observations",
    "improve the determination of the bolometric light curves of sne  ia . the uv spectrum at early times forms mainly in the outer shells of the explosion ejecta where the unburned outer layers of the white dwarf play a large role in shaping the appearance of the spectrum .",
    "the dependence of the uv emission on the progenitor metallicity has been theoretically studied by several authors ( pauldrach et al .",
    "1996 ; hflich et al . 1998 ; mazzali et al . 2000 ; lentz et al . 2000 ; timmes et al . 2003 ; sauer et al . 2008 ) .",
    "both hflich et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and sauer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) argued that increasing the metallicity in the outer layers would lead to a stronger uv flux , with the latter highlighting the contribution from the reverse - fluorescence scattering of photons from red to blue wavelengths .",
    "in contrast to the above studies , lentz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) predicted that increasing the metallicity of the progenitor should cause a decrease in the level of the uv pseudocontinuum due to a decrease in the line opacity and cooling .",
    "a much larger effect was proposed by timmes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who argued for a significant increase of @xmath11ni , and hence of the resulting luminosity , with increasing metallicity ( but see howell et al .",
    "we note that current theories do not offer a consensus picture as to the effects of changing metallicity on the overall uv flux .",
    "uv observations of a large sample of sne  ia are needed to help quantify the uv properties and constrain the above models .",
    "the necessity of observing above the earth s atmosphere has resulted in a sparse uv dataset for low - redshift sne  ia ; see panagia ( 2003 , 2007 ) and foley , filippenko , & jha ( 2008a ) for summaries of _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ and _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ spectra . recently ,",
    "the _ swift _ satellite obtained uv photometry of nearby sne  ia ( milne et al .",
    "2010 ; brown et al . 2010 ) , as well as some uv grism spectra ( bufano et  al . 2009 ; foley et al . 2011 ) . with the successful repair of the space telescope",
    "imaging spectrograph ( stis ) onboard _ hst _ during the 2009 servicing mission 4 , obtaining uv spectra with stis has also become possible ( cooke et al . 2011 ) .",
    "observations of distant sne  ia ( with ground - based telescopes ) provide larger samples that probe the uv spectral properties at high redshift ( e.g. , ellis et al .",
    "2008 ; sullivan et al . 2009 ; foley et al .",
    "2012 ) , since the rest - frame spectrum in the uv shifts to that in the optical region due to cosmic expansion .",
    "all of these datasets suggest significant dispersion in the uv for sne  ia at both low and high redshifts .",
    "however , precise evolutionary constraints are still limited by the absence of high - quality , low - redshift uv spectral data .    in _ hst _ cycle 13 ( year 20042005 ) , extensive uv observations of low - redshift sne  ia were conducted ( program go-10182 ; pi filippenko ) .",
    "unfortunately , with the failure of stis shortly before the project started , the pr200l prism became the only available element on _ hst _ capable of uv spectroscopic observations , yielding only low - resolution but still useful uv spectra of four sne  ia ( sne 2004dt , 2004ef , 2005 m , and 2005cf ) .",
    "these four objects represent three different subclasses of sne  ia . amongst our sample , sn 2004dt , and perhaps sn 2004ef , can be put into the high - velocity ( w09a ) or the high - velocity - gradient groups ( benetti et al . 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , sn 2004dt has the highest line polarization ever observed in a sn  ia ( wang et al .",
    "2006 ) , and is a clear outlier in the relationship between the si  ii velocity gradient and the nebular - phase emission - line velocity shift ( maeda et al . 2010 ) .",
    "sn 2005 m is a spectroscopically peculiar object like sn 1991 t ( filippenko et al .",
    "1992a ; phillips et al .",
    "1992 ) , with the early spectrum showing weak ca ii h&k lines and prominent fe  iii lines ( thomas et al . 2005 ) . and",
    "sn 2005cf has been regarded as a standard sn  ia ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2009b , hereafter w09b ) , belonging to the `` normal '' or the low - velocity - gradient group .",
    "our _ hst _ uv observations of the above four events reveal significant diversity of the uv properties among sne  ia .",
    "good understanding of the uv diversity forms the basis for further improvements in the application of sne  ia as cosmological probes .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "observations and data reduction are described in  2 , while  3 presents our results and a comparison with the existing uv data .",
    "discussions are given in  4 , and we summarize our conclusions in  5 .",
    "uv observations of sne 2004dt , 2004ef , 2005 m , and 2005cf were performed using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) high - resolution channel ( hrc ) in both the slitless prism spectroscopy and the direct imaging modes , as shown in figure 1 . observations with the hrc pr200l generally consist of a `` direct '' or undispersed image taken through the f330w filter , used to establish the zero point of the wavelength scale , and followed by dispersed images with one or more exposures through the pr200l prism .",
    "the parallel imaging observations were made through the f220w , f250w , and f330w filters , with the exposure time split into several segments .",
    "individual exposures were combined using the multidrizzle task within the space telescope science data analysis system ( stsdas ) to reject cosmic rays and perform geometric - distortion corrections .",
    "a log of the observations is given in table 1 , listing the exposure times of the prism and direct imaging exposures .",
    "the uv spectra were extracted in pyraf using the `` axe '' slitless spectroscopy reduction package ( kmmel et al .",
    "2004 , 2009 ) .",
    "the spectral extraction within axe relies upon the position , morphology , and photometry of the targets as observed in the accompanying direct image .",
    "note that the dispersion of the pr200l prism varies with wavelength in a highly non - linear fashion .",
    "for example , the spectral resolution is 5    pixel@xmath12 at 1800   and 105    pixel@xmath12 at 3500   , and it decreases rapidly to @xmath13563    pixel@xmath12 by 5000   ; see table 4 of larsen et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) for a detailed dispersion wavelength relation for the pr200l prism data .",
    "the rapidly decreasing dispersion toward longer wavelengths results in an extreme `` red pile - up '' effect for the pr200l data ( with flux at wavelengths longer than 4000    being compressed into just a few pixels ) , making studies of intrinsically red objects problematic ( see discussion in  3.2 ) . to decrease the contamination of red light toward shorter wavelengths , we chose a proper extraction window by taking advantage of the fact that the diffraction spikes from the red pile - up are at an angle to the dispersion .    in the reduction of the direct images , we performed aperture photometry on the drizzled images using an aperture radius of 4 pixels ( @xmath14 ) to get the optimal signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "inspection of the _ hst _ acs images taken with the hrc ( with a spatial resolution @xmath15 pixel@xmath12 ) shows that there is no significant emission from the diffuse source ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ; thus , we assume that the contamination of the host galaxy can be neglected for our uv photometry .",
    "the sky background level was determined from the median counts in an annulus of radius of 100130 pixels .",
    "the measured magnitudes were further corrected to an infinite - radius aperture and placed on the vega magnitude system ( sirianni et al .",
    "the aperture corrections from @xmath16 to an infinite aperture are 0.41 mag , 0.38 mag , and 0.35 mag for the f220w , f250w , and f330w filters , respectively .",
    "the photometric calibration of acs / hrc was obtained with the observations of several spectrophotometric standards and has an uncertainty better than 2% ( pavlovsky et  al .",
    "2004 ) , which we adopt as the uncertainty for our uv photometry .",
    "sources of error in obtaining absolute photometry include uncertainties in the red - leak correction and the @xmath17-correction .",
    "the red - leak effect , a common feature of uv filters , is contamination from an off - band flux in the red part of the spectrum . for stars with known colors or spectral types ,",
    "this effect can be accurately quantified ( pavlovsky et  al .",
    "2004 ; chiaberge & sirianni 2007 ; brown et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the red - leak correction is negligible for filter f330w , and is very small for filter f250w ( e.g. , @xmath182% for stars with colors bluer than the g type ) .",
    "this correction is greater for filter f220w because of a significant off - band flux contamination in this band , , ranging from @xmath19% for an a - type star ( corresponding to a sn  ia at early phases ) to @xmath20% for a g - type star ( corresponding to a sn  ia in the nebular phase ) . despite the fact that all of our sne  ia have low redshifts , @xmath17-corrections ( oke & sandage 1968 ) are non - negligible in the uv due to a large variation in the spectral flux at shorter wavelengths . in calculating the @xmath17- and red - leak corrections for the uv photometry",
    ", we have used the corresponding pr200l prism spectrum mangled to match with the observed photometry ( see  3.2 ) or a template from hsiao et  al . ( 2007 ) when the prism spectrum has extremely low quality or is not available .",
    "uncertainties in the above two corrections can be derived from the fluctuations of the input spectra , which are determined by the photometric errors ( for the mangled prism spectra ) or are taken to be @xmath21% of the flux ( for the template spectrum from hsiao et al . ) .",
    "the final _ hst _ acs uv magnitudes of sne 2004dt , 2004ef , and 2005 m , as well as the corresponding @xmath17- and red - leak corrections , are listed in table 2 ; corresponding data for sn 2005cf have been published by w09b .",
    "the distances to the sne were computed by using the recession velocity @xmath22 of their host galaxies ( see table 3 ) , with a hubble constant @xmath23 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 ( riess et al . 2009 ) . for objects in the hubble flow ( @xmath24 km s@xmath12 ) ( sne 2004dt , 2004ef , and 2005 m ) , the recession velocity",
    "was determined with respect to the 3  k cosmic microwave background radiation ; for the nearby sample with @xmath25 km s@xmath12 ( sn 2005cf ) , the velocity was corrected to a 220 km s@xmath12 virgocentric infall .",
    "bands ( ganeshalingam et al . 2010 ) . overlaid are the uv - optical template light curves of the `` gold standard '' sn  ia 2005cf ( w09b).,width=415 ]      figure 2 shows the uv light curves of sne 2004dt , 2004ef , and 2005 m obtained with the _ hst _ acs and the f220w , f250w , and f330w filters . also plotted are the corresponding optical light curves ( in @xmath26 ) from ganeshalingam et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . as sn 2005cf was well observed and",
    "is judged to be a normal sn  ia , and its light curves have been published elsewhere ( w09b ) , we use it as a template sn  ia for comparison study . to account for effects of the redshift on the observed sn flux , we applied @xmath17-corrections ( oke & sandage 1968 ) to all of the light curves using the observed spectra ( as shown in figures 5 and 6 ) and the hsiao et al .",
    "( 2007 ) template .",
    "the light curves have also been corrected for reddening in the host galaxy as well as in the milky way .",
    "the total reddening toward a sn  ia can be derived from an empirical relation established between decline rate @xmath27 and color indexes for a low - reddening sample ( e.g. , w09b , and references therein ) . by comparing the observed color with that predicted by the @xmath2 vs. @xmath28 ) relation",
    ", we estimate the total reddening @xmath29 as 0.10 mag for sn 2004dt , 0.17 for sn 2004ef , 0.12 mag for sn 2005 m , and 0.20 mag for sn 2005cf , with a typical error of 0.03 mag .",
    "the absorption in the milky way ( mw ) was estimated by using the reddening maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) and the cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) reddening law with @xmath30 , while extinction in the host galaxy was corrected applying an extinction law with @xmath31 ( e.g. , riess et al .",
    "1996 ; reindl et al . 2005",
    "; wang x. et al . 2006 ; kessler et al . 2009 ) .",
    "since all four sne  ia have low host - galaxy reddening ( e.g. , @xmath32 mag ) , a moderate change of the extinction - law coefficient will have limited effect on the uv light curves shown in figure 2 . according to the extinction - law coefficients recalculated by brown et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) , a change in @xmath33 from 1.8 ( lmc dust ) to 3.1 ( milky way dust ) will only result in a difference of @xmath34 mag in f330w and @xmath35 mag in f250w for a sn  ia with a host - galaxy reddening @xmath36 mag .",
    "note , however , that the magnitude change in f220w could be larger due to a dramatic variation in the resultant extinction coefficient @xmath37 .",
    "table 3 lists the relevant parameters of these four sne  ia .",
    "one can see from figure 2 that the uv light curves of our sne  ia show a large dispersion , especially at shorter wavelengths , while the optical counterparts are generally similar except in the @xmath38 band where there is more diversity . of our sample ,",
    "sn 2004ef appears relatively faint in all bands , consistent with the fact that it is a slightly faster decliner with @xmath39 mag .",
    "sn 2005 m is a spectroscopically peculiar object like sn 1991 t .",
    "this supernova has a slower decline rate ( @xmath40 mag ) , but it does not appear to be overluminous either in the uv or optical bands .",
    "however , our relative ignorance regarding the intrinsic color of these slow decliners might prevent us from deriving reliable reddenings for them .",
    "a notable feature in the plot is that the uv emission of sn 2004dt appears unusually strong around @xmath1-band maximum and decreases rapidly after maximum light .",
    "moreover , sn 2005 m seems to peak a few days earlier than sn 2005cf in the f220w and f250w bands .",
    "such a temporal shift seems to exist for sn 2004dt and sn 2004ef , although their light curves in uv are not well sampled around maximum brightness .",
    "the color curves of our four sne  ia , corrected for the mw and host - galaxy reddening , are presented in figure 3 .",
    "one can clearly see that their @xmath41 curves show remarkable differences despite having similar @xmath10 curves .",
    "sn 2004dt is quite peculiar , being very blue compared with the other three objects .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the _ swift _ uvot has seen a number of events (  7 ) that are also blue in the nuv - optical photometric colors ( private communication with p. milne ) .    since sn 2004dt",
    "has @xmath42 mag and a peak @xmath10 color ( @xmath43 mag ) similar to that of sn 2005cf , it is of interest to perform a detailed comparison of their uv properties . around maximum light , sn 2004dt is bluer than sn 2005cf by @xmath44 mag in @xmath45 and by @xmath8 mag in @xmath46 .",
    "about 23 weeks after maximum , the color difference becomes less significant as a result of the rapid decline of the post - maximum uv emission in sn 2004dt ( see fig .",
    "6 and the discussion in  3.2 ) . in the first 15 days after the maximum",
    ", the decline of the uv light curve is measured to be @xmath47 mag in f220w , @xmath48 mag in f250w , and @xmath49 mag in f330w for sn 2004dt .",
    "these are all larger than the corresponding values measured for sn 2005cf by @xmath500.9 mag ( see also table 10 in w09b ) .",
    "a faster post - maximum decline usually corresponds to a shorter rise time for the light curves of sne  ia in the optical bands , as evidenced by the fact that they can be better normalized through the stretch factor ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1997 ; goldhaber et al .",
    "2001 ) . for sn 2004dt , a shorter rise time in the uv is consistent with the high expansion velocity that could make the gamma - ray heating become less effective .",
    "moreover , a higher expansion velocity could extend the radius of the uv photosphere to higher velocities and hence result in a larger uv flux .",
    "the possible origin of the uv excess in sn 2004dt in the early phase is an interesting issue and is further discussed in  4.2 .      as shown in table 1 ,",
    "a total of 34 _ hst _ acs pr200l prism spectra have been collected for sne 2004dt , 2004ef , 2005 m , and 2005cf . in column",
    "( 5 ) of table 1 , we list the total exposure time for each spectrum , resulting from a series of coadded cr - split exposures . among the four sne  ia observed with the _ hst _ acs , sn 2005cf and sn 2004dt have better temporal sequences and higher s / n for their uv spectra ( see fig",
    ". 5 and 6 ) . owing to very low spectral resolution at longer wavelengths , our analysis in this paper is restricted to the useful wavelength range 18003500   .",
    "to evaluate the quality of the prism data , we compare the synthetic magnitudes derived from the uv spectra with those obtained by direct imaging observations for sn 2005cf and sn 2004dt ( see figure 4 ) . in f330w , these two measurements match well with each other near maximum light , but the spectrophotometric magnitudes decline more slowly starting about one week after maximum .",
    "a similar trend in the decline rate exists in the f220w and f250w bands of sn 2004dt , and in the f250w band of sn 2005cf .",
    "however , compared with the corresponding imaging observations , it is alarming that the flux of the prism spectra is too high in the f250w band ( @xmath13 0.6 mag for sn 2004dt , @xmath130.7 mag for sn 2005cf ) , and especially in the f220w band ( @xmath131.0 mag for sn 2004dt , @xmath132.0 mag for sn 2005cf ) .",
    "this suggests that the flux level of pr200l calibrated by the white dwarfs ( which are very blue ) may not be accurate for the flux calibration of the supernova .    according to acs / hrc instrument science report acs 2006 - 03 ( larsen et  al .",
    "2006 ) , the flux calibration of the pr200l prism spectra based on white dwarfs is expected to be accurate to @xmath51% over the wavelength range 18003000   . however , red objects usually suffer systematic errors in the uv flux calibration because the blue end of the spectrum can be highly contaminated by scattered light from the red end as a result of the `` red pile - up '' effect .",
    "such an effect is probably a dominant factor accounting for the higher f250w and f220w fluxes , as indicated by the wavelength - dependent discrepancy between the spectrophotometry and observed photometry , as well as for the slower post - maximum decline seen in all three uv bands for the sne in our sample ; sne  ia are known to become progressively redder after maximum light and the contamination of the red light becomes increasingly significant .",
    "however , the red pile - up effect is at present poorly quantified , and more test observations of objects covering a wide range of colors are clearly needed to better calibrate pr200l prism spectra .",
    "fortunately , we also have acs hrc photometry taken nearly at the same time , making it possible to obtain accurate relative flux calibration of the pr200l prism spectra .",
    "given the relatively smooth variations in the raw prism spectra , it is not difficult to model the continuum of the spectra with a simple polynomial function .",
    "the final calibrated spectra of sn 2005cf and sn 2004dt are shown in figures 5 and 6 ; the spectrophotometry is consistent with the photometric results within @xmath520.05 mag .",
    "however , the observed increase in flux below about 2200    is almost certainly an artifact and should not be trusted .",
    "the uv spectra of sn 2004ef have poor s / n ; the object is relatively faint , being at a larger distance ( @xmath53 mpc ) . only a single uv - prism spectrum was obtained of sn 2005 m .",
    "the uv spectra of sn 2004ef and sn 2005 m are shown in figure 7 .",
    "figure 5 shows the evolution of the combined uv - optical spectrum of sn 2005cf from @xmath54 days to @xmath55 days relative to the @xmath1-band maximum .",
    "the ground - based spectra are taken from w09a and garavini et al .",
    "spectra obtained within 12 days of each other were combined directly . in cases where no contemporaneous optical spectrum was available , an interpolated spectrum was used .",
    "after flux calibration with the corresponding acs / hrc photometry , the uv - prism spectra agree reasonably well with their optical counterparts over the spectral range 33003500    ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "3250   absorption feature .",
    "the increase in flux below about 2200    is almost certainly an artifact and should not be trusted.,width=340 ]    it is known that in the uv spectra of sne  ia , almost no individual lines can be identified .",
    "this is because the vast number of iron - group element lines in the uv overlap strongly , eliminating individual line features .",
    "this contrasts with the optical , where p - cygni lines of neutral or singly ionized ions of intermediate - mass elements ( mostly o , mg , si , s , and ca ) can usually be identified .",
    "probably the only individual feature in sn  ia uv spectra blueward of @xmath56    that can be obviously identified is the p - cygni line ( absorption feature at @xmath57   ) caused by mg  ii @xmath582800 which was seen in _",
    "spectra of sn 1992a at @xmath59 days after @xmath1 maximum ( kirshner et al .",
    "1993 ) . in our spectra",
    ", we see no clear evidence of this line or any other line - like feature blueward of @xmath60   . in most of our spectra ,",
    "this is probably caused by the low s / n and low resolution . in the case of sn  2004dt , the effect that led to strong uv emission ( e.g. , circumstellar matter interaction ) may have smoothed out line - like features ( see the discussion below ) .    inspecting the near - maximum uv spectra in the wavelength range 18003500   , we identify a prominent absorption feature near 3250   .",
    "it is also seen in the _ swift _ uvot uv - grism spectrum of sn 2005cf near maximum light ( e.g. , bufano et al .",
    "2009 ; see also fig . 9 ) and",
    "the stis uv spectra of the palomar transient factory sample of sne  ia ( cooke et al . 2011 ) . however , we note that the relatively weak absorption feature near @xmath61    seen in stis and _ swift _ spectra is nearly invisible in the _ hst _ uv spectrum , indicating the limited resolution of the _ hst_/acs prism",
    ". the resolution effect can be demonstrated by degrading the _ swift _ spectrum .",
    "the @xmath61    feature becomes very weak in the _ swift _ spectrum degraded to a resolution of @xmath62    pixel@xmath12 ( see the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "9 ) , and this feature almost disappears when further decreasing the spectral resolution to @xmath63    pixel@xmath12 ( see the dashed line in fig . 9 ) .",
    "the absorption feature near 3250    also becomes less significant at a resolution @xmath63    pixel@xmath12 , consistent with that observed in the _ hst _ prism spectrum .",
    "the flux ratio @xmath64 , defined as @xmath65(2770  )/@xmath65(2900   ) , has been proposed to correlate with the peak luminosity of sne  ia ( foley , filippenko , & jha 2008 ) .",
    "our _ hst _ spectra are not appropriate for testing such a correlation due to their limited resolution ( @xmath66    pixel@xmath12 at 28002900   ) , which could have significant impact on the intrinsic uv slope within such a narrow wavelength range .",
    "even more importantly , as discussed in  3.2 , red pile - up affects the spectra substantially in this region .",
    "the near - uv features in the @xmath673500    range of the early - time spectra of sne  ia were initially studied by branch & venkatakrishna ( 1986 ) , who suggested that they are produced by blends of fe  ii and co  ii lines . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath68    absorption feature has been attributed to blueshifted co  ii absorption ( rest wavelength 33503500   ; branch et al .",
    "1985 ) , and the absorption feature at @xmath61    is ascribed to fe  ii absorption . based on their study of the prominent example sn 1992a , kirshner et al .",
    "( 1993 ) confirmed that the near - uv region is largely formed by a complex blend of iron - group element lines .",
    "they found that cr  ii , mn  ii , and fe  ii contribute significantly to the absorption - like feature at @xmath69   , while the ions co  ii and ni  ii make no significant contribution because the newly synthesized ni - co is confined to the inner regions at these early phases .",
    "the spectral properties of sne  ia in the uv were also investigated by sauer et al .",

    "such a fast decline of the uv flux is rarely seen in the existing sample of sne  ia , possibly an indication of differences in the explosion physics or progenitor environment with respect to normal sne  ia .",

    "the relevant results of the best linear fit with different values of @xmath33 to the @xmath103 relation are shown in table 4 .",

    "strong emission in the uv is likely an intrinsic property of sn 2004dt rather than being due to improper corrections for the dust reddening , since we only applied a small reddening correction to this supernova , @xmath112 mag .",
    "moreover , sn 2004dt still appears much brighter and bluer in the uv than the mean values defined by the other sne  ia even if it is assumed to suffer little reddening . on the other hand , sn 2006x",
    "is heavily extinguished by dust having an abnormal extinction law , perhaps with @xmath113 ( wang et al .",

    "2010 ) to the uv magnitudes of sn 2006x would make it appear brighter than the other comparisons by @xmath114 mag in uvw1/f250w .",
    "we caution , however , that this result may suffer large uncertainties from the speculated extinction and red - tail corrections .",
    "to examine how the relative flux in the uv evolves after the sn explosion , we compute the ratio of the uv emission ( 18003500   ) to the optical ( 35009000   ) , @xmath115 , for a few sne  ia , as shown in figure 11 . the flux ratios obtained for sn 2005cf and sn 2005ke are overplotted .",

    "the integrated fluxes of these two sne  ia are obtained approximately by the mean flux multiplied by the effective width of the passband .",
    "it is noteworthy that the flux ratio shown for sn 2006x might be just a lower limit , as we did not include the flux contribution below 2500    in the analysis because of the larger uncertainties in the extinction , @xmath17-corrections , and red - tail corrections at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. , brown et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "we notice that the @xmath115 value of sn 2006x peaks at @xmath116 days before the @xmath1-band maximum , about 5 days earlier than for sn 2005cf and the templates .",

    "owing to the lack of earlier uv data , we can not conclude whether such a feature is present in sn 2004dt .",
    "it is apparent that the flux ratio @xmath115 exhibits a large scatter at comparable phases for the selected sample of sne  ia .",
    "consequently , the spread in bolometric corrections may affect significantly the inferring of the nickel masses from the light - curve peaks .",

    "the near - infrared ( nir ) photometry of sne 2004ef and 2005 m was taken from contreras et al .",
    "the nir emission of sn 2004dt was corrected on the basis of sn 2005cf ( w09b ) .",
    "similar corrections were applied to the comparison sne  ia when the nir observations were not available .",
    "overall , the quasi - bolometric light curves of our sne  ia are very similar in shape , with the exception of sn 2004dt , which shows a prominent `` bump '' feature .",
    "this `` bump '' is consistent with the secondary maximum visible in the @xmath38 band ( see fig .",

    "we see that the deduced @xmath123 of the four sne  ia shows significant scatter , and the value for sn 2004dt is slightly larger than the normal values .",
    "the net effect of a larger @xmath123 would tend to delay the secondary maximum of the nir light curves , inconsistent with what is seen in sn 2004dt .",
    "this inconsistency can be resolved if sn 2004dt has a shorter rise time , @xmath134  d. given the observational evidence that longer @xmath124 usually corresponds to slower post - maximum decline of the light curve ( ganeshalingam et al .",
    "2011 ) , sn 2004dt may rise to maximum at a faster pace .",
    "a shorter rise time is likely to be a common feature of the high - velocity sne  ia ( zhang et al .",
    "2010 ; ganeshalingam et al .",
    "therefore , the deduced nickel mass of sn 2004dt may have been overestimated to some extent . on the other hand ,",
    "the implied @xmath123 for sn 2005 m seems quite normal and is lower than in slowly declining sne  ia such as sn 1991 t , indicating that the light - curve widths are not a single - parameter family of the ejected nickel mass .",
    "the uv emission of sne  ia is thought to originate predominantly from the outer layers of the ejecta because uv photons produced in deeper layers are subject to line blanketing by the wealth of bound - bound transitions associated with iron - group elements . therefore , uv features are a promising probe to study the composition of the outer ejecta of sne  ia .",
    "previous work has shown that the uv is particularly sensitive to the metal content of the outer ejecta ( line - blocking effect ) and their ionization ( backwarming effect : lentz et al .",
    "2000 ; sauer et al .",
    "lentz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested a correlation between the emitted uv flux and the progenitor metallicity , with lower flux for models with higher metallicity . on the other hand , sauer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) proposed that the uv flux can become stronger at high metallicity in the outer layers due to an enhanced reverse - fluorescence scattering of photons from red to blue wavelengths and a change in the ionization fraction ( backwarming effect ) .",
    "according to the model series for sn 2001eh and sn 2001ep ( sauer et al .",
    "2008 ) , as well as the prediction by lentz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , an abundance change of about @xmath135 dex ( e.g. , variations from 1/10 normal metallicity in the c+o layer to 10 times normal metallicity in the c+o layer ) could lead to a change of up to @xmath106 mag in f250w / uvw1 .",
    "this is much smaller than that observed in sn 2004dt .",
    "note that the above studies are based on the one - dimensional deflagration model w7 ( nomoto et  al .",
    "1984 ) .    to illustrate the effect of different progenitor metallicity on the uv spectra in more detail",
    ", we also consider a sub - chandrasekhar - mass detonation model proposed by sim et al .",
    "in particular , we adopt the model of a @xmath136 co white dwarf ( model 1.06 ) , which was found to give good agreement with the observed properties of normal sne  ia in the optical . for this model , sim et al .",
    "( 2010 ) studied the effect of progenitor metallicity on the nucleosynthetic yields and , in turn , the synthetic observables . for that purpose",
    "they polluted the initial co white dwarf with 7.5% @xmath137ne ( corresponding to a progenitor metallicity of @xmath138 ) . from this",
    "they find that the metallicity mainly affects the blue bands ( specifically , they find the @xmath1-band peak magnitude to be @xmath139mag dimmer for the model with @xmath140 compared to the model with @xmath141 ) . in figure  13(a ) , we show the uv spectra of these models at maximum light , which were obtained using monte carlo radiative transfer code artis ( kromer & sim 2009 ) . to get better coverage in progenitor metallicity , we added another model at @xmath142 which was obtained in exactly the same manner as described by sim et  al .",
    "it is clearly seen that the uv flux increases significantly with decreasing progenitor metallicity . however , comparing the synthetic spectra to observed spectra of sn  2004dt , it is also obvious that the metallicity effect can not be the dominant factor responsible for the unusual brightness of sn 2004dt in the uv , as it is not possible to enhance the uv flux farther than for the model with zero metallicity .",
    "sn 2004dt shows line - expansion velocities which are apparently larger than those of normal sne  ia . to investigate",
    "if these higher ejecta velocities can explain the uv excess of sn 2004dt , we adopted the standard deflagration model w7 ( nomoto et al .",
    "1984 ) , which is known to reproduce the observed maximum - light spectra of sne  ia very well .",
    "the @xmath143 day models shown in figure  13(b ) were calculated using the time - dependent phoenix code in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ; jack et al .",
    "2009 ; 2011 ) .",
    "the velocities in w7 were increased by a uniform factor ( 20% or 40% ) .",
    "the densities were adjusted so that the total mass was conserved .",
    "figure  12(b ) clearly shows enhanced uv emission when the velocities are larger ; the effects of line blending in the uv serve to increase the radius of the uv pseudo - photosphere . normalizing the spectral flux over the 40005500    region , we find that the uv flux emitted in the 25003500    region can be increased by about 40% if the expansion velocity @xmath144 is increased by 20% everywhere in w7 .",
    "note that increasing @xmath144 by 40% does not further enhance the uv flux , and the resulting flux increase in the 25003500    region drops to 34% .",
    "this indicates that an increase of the expansion velocity can lead to more uv flux , but it can not reproduce the very large flux enhancement near 3000    in sn 2004dt .",
    "interestingly , sn 2004dt is the most highly polarized sn  ia ever observed . across the si",
    "ii line its polarization @xmath145 reaches up to 1.6% at @xmath146 week before maximum light ( wang et  al . 2006 ) , indicating that its si  ii layers substantially depart from spherical symmetry . among the comparison sample , sn 2006x also has a large degree of polarization in the early phase , with @xmath147% at 6  d before maximum light ( patat et  al .",
    "thus , it could well be that viewing - angle effects play a major role in the observed uv excess of sn 2004dt .",
    "breaking of spherical symmetry in the explosion is also thought to be a critical factor responsible for the observed scatter among sne  ia ( e.g. , wang , baade , & patat 2007 ; kasen et  al .",

    "2011 ) .",
    "kromer & sim ( 2009 ) recently studied the effect of asymmetric ejecta on the light curves and spectra of sne  ia using an ellipsoidal ( prolate ) toy model .",
    "they found that sne observed along the equator - on axis are always brighter than those observed along the pole - on axis .",
    "this effect is strongest in the bluer bands because the photons at short wavelengths are more strongly trapped than photons in other bands and therefore tend to preferentially leak out along the equatorial plane where the photospheric velocity is smallest .",
    "around maximum light , the difference @xmath148 measured in the @xmath98 band could be @xmath101 mag larger than that in the @xmath149 band ( kromer & sim 2009 ) .",
    "after maximum light , this line - of - sight effect becomes weaker with time as the ejecta become optically thin at these wavelengths .",
    "thus , the uv excess seen in sn 2004dt could also be due to a geometric effect .",
    "we have described how there are several competing possible explanations for the enhanced uv flux in sn  2004dt .",
    "this is due to the complex nature of line blanketing in the barely optically thick , but highly scattering dominated , differentially expanding sn  ia atmosphere .",
    "this effect was described in part by bongard et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who showed that the complete spectrum is formed throughout the semitransparent atmosphere and that fe  iii lines produce features that are imprinted on the full spectrum , partially explaining the uv excess found in sn  2004dt . indeed , the differing results of hflich et al . ( 1998 ) and sauer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , compared with those of lentz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , are perhaps due to the complex nature of spectral formation , ionization , and radiative transfer effects .",
    "while asymmetry could play some role , there seems to be enough variation in spherically symmetric models due to effects of varying ionization that is likely produced by a density profile that differs from that of w7 .",
    "recall that w7 has a density bump that occurs when the flame is quenched and momentum conservation causes material to pile up ahead of the dying flame .",
    "also , the higher brightness and indications of a somewhat higher nickel mass in sn  2004dt will affect the ionization state of the iron - peak elements , which are almost certainly responsible in part for the observed uv excess .",
    "more uv observations of nearby sne  ia are needed to thoroughly understand these effects , and whether they are due to asymmetries or other phenomena in the explosion .",
    "we have presented _ hst _ acs uv photometry and spectra of sne  ia obtained during cycle 13 ( 20042005 ) .",
    "these data include 34 acs prism spectra and 110 photometric observations of four sne  ia ( sne 2004dt , 2004ef , 2005 m , and 2005cf ) .",
    "the spectral analysis is limited by the low resolution and low s / n of the data .",
    "however , comparison with the existing low - redshift mean spectra of sne  ia clearly indicates that significant dispersion exists at wavelengths below @xmath93   .",
    "in particular , sn 2004dt is found to show a prominent , broad emission peak at 30003500    in the near - maximum spectrum , rather than having an absorption - like feature at @xmath68    similar to that in normal sne  ia such as sn 2005cf .",
    "another interesting feature of sn 2004dt is the rapid decline of its uv emission after the peak .",
    "based on a larger sample of sne  ia , we studied the properties of their peak luminosity in the uv region .",
    "the luminosity in uvw1/f250w shows a correlation with the light - curve parameter @xmath2 , but with significantly larger scatter than that found in the optical : @xmath101 mag in uvw1/f250w vs. @xmath4 mag in @xmath1 .",
    "the increased dispersion in the uv has also been noted in other studies with independent sn  ia samples of both photometry ( e.g. , guy et  al .",
    "2007 ; brown et  al . 2010 ) and spectra ( ellis et  al . 2008 ; cooke et  al . 2011 ; foley et  al . 2012 ) , which is likely intrinsic and has been interpreted as compositional differences between events .",
    "however , variations of the abundance based either on the w7 model or the sub - chandrasekhar - mass detonation model can not account for the uv excess seen in sn 2004dt .",
    "the w7 model with increased expansion velocities has also been investigated , but it can explain only part of the large uv flux in this object .    in our study , the comparison object sn 2006x may also exhibit strong emission in the uv .",
    "some common features for sn 2004dt and sn 2006x are the distinctly high - velocity features beyond the photosphere , slower @xmath1-band light - curve evolution in the early nebular phase ( wang et al .",
    "2008a ) , and a large degree of ejecta polarization near the optical maximum ( patat et al .",
    "the above observed features of these two objects are perhaps related to an asymmetric explosion of the high - velocity sne  ia ( wang et al .",
    "2012 , in prep . ) .",
    "line - of - sight effects due to the asymmetric explosion can have a more significant effect on the observed scatter in the uv than in other bands .",
    "a new proposal to identify the progenitors based on the symmetry properties of the explosion has recently been proposed by livio & pringle ( 2011 ) . however , more detailed studies are clearly needed to investigate this fully for realistic models .    the question of whether a uv excess is a more general property of the high - velocity subclass merits further study with a larger sample having earlier observations like ptf  11kly / sn  2011fe ( brown et  al .",
    "we note , however , that the origin of the high - velocity features and large polarization observed in sn 2004dt and sn 2006x probably differs , since the former does not follow the relation between the early - phase velocity gradient and the nebular - phase emission - line velocity shift while the latter does ( maeda et al .",
    "sn 2004dt is also found to be an outlier in the relation between the line polarization of si  ii @xmath586355 and the nebular velocity offset ( maund et al . 2010 ) .",
    "moreover , the reddening of sn 2004dt by its host galaxy is low , while sn 2006x is heavily extinguished , perhaps by circumstellar dust ( patat et al . 2007 ; wang et al .",
    "thus , the physical origin of the uv excess in these two sne  ia might not be the same . in sn 2006x",
    ", dust scattering may contribute in part to the unusually bright behavior in the uv , which is favored by the detection of surrounding circumstellar material ( patat et al .",
    "2007 ) and/or a light echo around this object ( wang et al .",
    "2008b ) .",
    "we further emphasize here the significance of the discovery of a uv excess in sn 2004dt .",
    "it provides not only a new clue to the study of sn  ia physics and/or the progenitor environments , but also draws attention to another possible systematic error that might exist in current cosmological studies : the relatively higher uv flux would result in a bluer @xmath150 color for some sne  ia , which could lead to an underestimate of the host - galaxy reddening and hence an overestimate of the distance .",
    "it is of interest to determine the fractional population of the sn 2004dt - like events or those showing a uv excess in both the local and distant universe , and to estimate the impact of such a peculiar subclass of sne  ia on current cosmological results .",
