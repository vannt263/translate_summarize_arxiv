    "none of these constructions capture the notion of nested sets of posets , as we do below .",
    "indeed , our notion of the set of poset tubes is not a classical building set , but falls in a different category altogether .    in this paper , we construct a new family of convex polytopes which are extensions of nestohedra and graph associahedra via a generalization of building sets .",

    "we use this assumption to show that truncating to create the facet @xmath127 will preserve the property of intersection : to obtain @xmath121 from @xmath126 , add @xmath122 but crucially also remove at least one tube ; specifically , we claim that at least one tube in @xmath128 will be removed .",
    "since truncation occurs in decreasing order of containment , the tubes @xmath129 are all sequentially and properly contained inside of @xmath122 . and since any tube of @xmath130 must be contained in the smallest of the tubes @xmath124 , if there is one or more @xmath131 , then the tubes in @xmath128 can not all be found again among the tubes in the sets @xmath132 , nor in @xmath130 itself .",
    "finally , remove some of @xmath128 when @xmath122 is the smallest tube in @xmath20 containing @xmath8 , since @xmath20 ( being filled ) can not contain @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath133 does not contain @xmath128 , truncating face @xmath77 ( whose containing facets are labeled by @xmath128 ) will not separate the facets labeled by the tubes of @xmath134 however , @xmath77 does intersect the face where the facets labeled by @xmath135 intersect , so their intersection will further intersect the new facet labeled by @xmath136 thus , the facets labeled by the tubes in @xmath121 will have a nonempty intersection .        _",
    "_  construct the new polytope @xmath4 by truncating certain faces of @xmath137 begin by labeling the vertices of @xmath138 with the elements of @xmath19 , and its faces by the subset of vertex labels which they contain .",
    "the faces of @xmath139 get labeled by the pairing @xmath140 , for the corresponding tubing @xmath20 of @xmath141 and subset @xmath70 of @xmath19 .",
    "now truncate the faces labeled with @xmath140 where tubing @xmath20 has only one tube @xmath26 . if @xmath46 , label the resulting new facet with @xmath26 .",
    "after truncations , let the label of each face be the set of labels of its adjacent facets , retaining the old labels for any facets not truncated .",
    "we perform this truncation iteratively , based on _ increasing _ size of tubes @xmath26 .",
    "it is straightforward that labeling tubes of the facets of our truncated polytope are in bijection with the tubes of @xmath3 .",
    "we show that @xmath97 is a bijection of tubings by checking that a collection @xmath20 of tubes @xmath26 of @xmath3 is a tubing if and only if its corresponding facets @xmath142 in @xmath4 intersect at a face .",
    "this simultaneously shows that @xmath97 preserves the ordering of tubings .    _",
    "_  we show if @xmath20 is not a tubing , then @xmath100 has empty intersection . if not a tubing , there is either a subset @xmath68 of @xmath20 that is not filled , or there is a pair of nonnested but intersecting tubes in @xmath20 . in the case of the former ,",
    "when @xmath68 is unfilled , we see implied a further subset @xmath143 that was unfilled in the poset @xmath144 , where @xmath143 consists of the tubes of @xmath68 with one modification : replace any portion of @xmath19 in those tubes with @xmath8 .",
    "since , by induction , the facets labeled by tubes of @xmath143 have no common intersection in @xmath145 and since the product of polytopes preserves this fact , then the faces of the product bearing labels from @xmath143 do not have a common intersection .",
    "now consider when @xmath20 contains intersecting , nonnested tubes , say @xmath101 and @xmath102 of @xmath3 .",
    "replace any portion of @xmath19 contained in them with @xmath8 , resulting in @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "if these tubes are still intersecting but nonnested , their facets in @xmath141 had no intersection , and this property will be passed along to our new polytope .",
    "but if the tubes @xmath148 and @xmath149 are nested or equal , then both @xmath101 and @xmath102 contained some of @xmath19 , and we must further consider the intersection @xmath150 if this is empty , then @xmath101 and @xmath102 are tubes created by truncating faces of the product polytope @xmath139 , which in turn corresponded to faces of @xmath138 which did not intersect . again the non - intersection is inherited by @xmath141 .",
    "finally if is nonempty , then it is straightforward to see that the facets labeled by @xmath101 and @xmath102 result from truncating faces that originally do intersect in @xmath139 . here",
    ", there is a third , prior truncation ( of a face @xmath77 ) of the product polytope that contains the intersection of the faces that are truncated to become @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , face @xmath77 gives rise to the facet labeled by the tube @xmath151 , and thus was labeled in the product by the smaller of @xmath148 and @xmath149 , paired with .",
    "therefore , it is truncated first and effectively separates the others .    _ _  using finite induction on the truncated tubes @xmath152 in @xmath3 , we show if @xmath20 is a tubing , then @xmath100 has nonempty intersection .",
    "our argument proceeds by constructing a series of @xmath38 truncations , showing at each step that the tubes do indeed label facets that intersect . for a tubing @xmath20 ,",
    "create the set of pairs @xmath153 where @xmath154 this set gives a list of faces of @xmath139 , whose intersection is nonempty , providing the base case for truncation : since @xmath20 is a tubing , the tubes of @xmath20 which contain @xmath18 are all nested , and by our construction of @xmath120 , the set of second elements in the pairs are subsets of @xmath19 having a common intersection .",
    "recursively define an intermediate set of labels @xmath121 , formed by performing truncations to create facets labeled by @xmath155 .",
    "if @xmath122 is not in @xmath20 , let @xmath121 be @xmath126 . otherwise , @xmath121 is formed by discarding from @xmath126 the pair @xmath156 and replacing it with @xmath122 itself .",
    "this corresponds to labeling the new facet with the new tube @xmath122 .",
    "we need to show that faces labeled by elements of @xmath121 still have a nonempty intersection after the truncation of face @xmath122 .",
    "if @xmath122 does not contain @xmath18 , then it labels a facet and its truncation does not change the polytope .",
    "otherwise , @xmath122 is either ( 1 ) contained in or ( 2 ) intersects ( but is not nested with ) some tube @xmath129 .    in the latter case ( 2 ) , where @xmath122 intersects such a tube , then @xmath157 and we argue that the truncated face does not contain the intersection of the facets labeled by @xmath121 .",
    "this follows because @xmath122 either inherits an empty intersection with the faces represented by @xmath120 ( from one of the two polytopes in the cross product ) , or is separated from the intersection of the faces represented by @xmath126 by an earlier truncation ( from the proof in the forward direction ) .",
    "now consider the former case ( 1 ) : if @xmath158 , let @xmath159 be the facet labeled by the pair @xmath160 . here , before any truncation",
    ", @xmath159 originally contains faces labeled by @xmath161 , for @xmath162 . on the other hand , if @xmath163 , let @xmath159 be the facet labeled by the pair @xmath164 , for some @xmath165 . in this case , this facet contains faces labeled by @xmath166 , where @xmath167 and @xmath168 .    in either case , @xmath159 is chosen to contain the truncated face at step @xmath169 and no other face scheduled to be truncated afterwards .",
    "moreover , @xmath159 is chosen such that it will eventually be labeled by a tube @xmath26 that intersects but is not nested with @xmath129 . therefore , since we are dealing with simple polytopes , @xmath159 also can not contain any of the facets represented by the elements of @xmath121 , both those labeled by tubes not containing @xmath18 , and those created by earlier truncations .    finally , note that the truncated face @xmath122 was assumed to intersect the common intersection of all the other faces represented by @xmath126 , and",
    "so the facet created still does .",
    "therefore , the faces represented by @xmath121 have a common intersection , and thus the tubing @xmath20 will be represented by facets with a common intersection in @xmath4 ."
