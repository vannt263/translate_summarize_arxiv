    "the possible existence of an axigluon was first realized in chiral color models  @xcite , where the gauge group of the strong interaction is extended from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . at low energy ,",
    "this larger color gauge group breaks to the usual @xmath8 with its octet of massless vector gluons , but it leaves a residual @xmath10 with an octet of massive , axial vector bosons called _ axigluons_. in these chiral color models , the axigluon is expected to have a mass of order the electroweak scale .",
    "similar states are predicted in technicolor models  @xcite .    in order to search for these states , bagger , schmidt and",
    "king  @xcite noted that the di - jet cross section at hadron colliders would be modified by the addition of @xmath11-channel axigluon exchange .",
    "searches were performed by the ua1 and cdf collaborations , with limits of @xmath12 by ua1  @xcite and @xmath13 by cdf  @xcite . given additional center of mass energy and/or luminosity , these di - jet searched at hadron colliders will easily raise the upper exclusion limit , but it will be difficult to decrease the lower exclusion limit .",
    "several additional search strategies were suggested involving the @xmath14 and the large amounts of data taken by the lep experiments .",
    "rizzo  @xcite suggested @xmath15 and carlson , _ et al .",
    "_ ,  @xcite suggested @xmath16 going through a quark loop .",
    "these suggestions involve low rates , and the former requires precision multi - jet reconstruction .    in the remainder of this report",
    ", i will address some additional search strategies for the axigluon , and report on the current status of the search .",
    "the decay of the @xmath2 family is an ideal area to search for low mass , strongly interacting particles . in the standard model ,",
    "the dominant hadronic decay mode of any heavy vector quarkonium state ( @xmath17 ) is the 3 gluon mode , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 refers to the specific flavor of heavy quark .",
    "the decay to a single gluon is forbidden by color , while the decay to 2 gluons is forbidden by both the landau - pomeranchuk - yang theorem  @xcite ( which forbids the decay of a @xmath20 state to 2 massless spin 1 states ) and quantum numbers ( @xmath21 for the gluon , so an odd number of gluons are needed for this particular decay ) .",
    "the leading order decay rate of a heavy quarkonium state to 3 gluons is well known : @xmath22 .",
    "the decay rate for @xmath23 is given by  @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "both this decay rate and the leading order standard model rate depend on the non - relativistic radial wavefunction ; a ratio of these two decay rates does not depend on the wavefunction , and , as such , had much less uncertainty .",
    "the ratio is given by : @xmath26 notice that , since the gluon plus axigluon mode has one fewer power of @xmath27 , the ratio is large ( the numerical factor in front of the kinematical structure is approximately 100 ) .",
    "this ratio , as a function of @xmath28 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the addition of this new hadronic decay mode will at least double the hadronic width of a vector quarkonium state , even for an axigluon mass nearly equal to the quarkonium state mass . using this process and the @xmath2 system",
    ", we can exclude an axigluon with mass below about @xmath29 . a analysis by cuypers and frampton  @xcite yielded quantitatively similar conclusions .",
    "in addition to @xmath2 decays to real axigluons , it is possible to study @xmath2 decays to virtual axigluons , @xmath30 .",
    "the decay rate is given by  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of active quark flavors ( in this case 4 ) and @xmath33 as before , we can look at the ratio of this hadronic width to the dominant standard model width : @xmath34 this time , there is no large numerical factor .",
    "this ratio is shown in figure  2 .",
    "the dashed lines in the figure indicate 2 possible exclusion limits that can be made using data . the more conservative estimate is to argue that our knowledge of the @xmath2 width is such that a correction to the standard width larger than 50% is unacceptable ; thus , this ratio is smaller than 0.5 , which gives an upper exclusion limit of @xmath35 .",
    "a less conservative estimate is to compare this correction to the expected rate to qcd radiative corrections to the standard model rate and other possible contributions to the hadronic width ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xmath36 ) , and argue that another correction larger than these is unacceptable . in this case , the ratio must be less than 0.25 , excluding axigluons with mass smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "not long after our work on the @xmath2 , cuypers and frampton and cuypers , falk and frampton  @xcite published papers on the @xmath6 value in @xmath4 collisions at low energy .",
    "they included the full set of qcd radiative corrections , including axigluon radiative corrections , to the tree level process .",
    "they exclude an axigluon with @xmath37 using pep and petra data .",
    "the top is too short lived to allow for a toponium state ; if it did , the same techniques that worked in the @xmath2 system would work for toponium as well . on the other hand , because of the large mass of the top , top production is inherently perturbative , @xmath38 is well understood , and it can be used to search for a light axigluon . the parton level cross section for @xmath38 , due to an @xmath11-channel gluon ,",
    "is well known : @xmath39\\ ] ] and the cross section with the addition of an @xmath11-channel axigluon is  @xcite @xmath40\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the top quark velocity parameter , @xmath43 .",
    "the addition of an @xmath11-channel axigluon affects both the total cross section and the forward - backward asymmetry ( only the interference term affects the forward - backward asymmetry ) .",
    "the results on total cross section are shown in figure  3 . from the relatively good agreement between experimental values of the top cross section  @xcite and theoretical calculations  @xcite",
    ", we can say that an axigluon is disfavored by top production cross section , but nothing conclusive can be said .",
    "shown in figure  4 is the forward - backward asymmetry in top production as a function of axigluon mass . without an axigluon ,",
    "the asymmetry is identically zero .",
    "unitarity is violated , in that @xmath44 will be non - perturbative unless @xmath45 as pointed out by robinett  @xcite . using the top quark as @xmath19 , this leads to a lower limit on the axigluon mass of @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "higgs searches , _ e.g. _ , by cdf , can make use of the process @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the neutral higgs boson , and it is assumed to decay to @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "the limit on higgs boson mass is such that @xmath50 are not allowed .",
    "the same final state is possible with an axigluon in place of the higgs boson ; we find the part level cross section for @xmath51 to be  @xcite : @xmath52 \\frac{|v_{qq'}|^2}{\\hat{u } \\hat{t } \\hat{s}^2 }   \\left [ \\hat{u}^2 + \\hat{t}^2 + 2 \\hat{s } ( m_w^2 + m_a^2 ) -   \\frac{m_a^2 m_w^2 ( \\hat{u}^2 + \\hat{t}^2)}{\\hat{u } \\hat{t } } \\right].\\ ] ] assuming @xmath53 , and calculating the cross section for the associated production of @xmath54 , a conservative lower limit of @xmath55 is possible , using the same analysis at the higgs search .",
    "finally , we can examine the value of @xmath27 , extracted from low energy data but run up to @xmath56 to the value of @xmath27 extracted from the hadronic width of the @xmath14 at the pole .",
    "since the axigluon mass is expected to be at least @xmath57 , the running of @xmath27 should not be affected much by the axigluon .",
    "then , the @xmath6 value at low energy , or the hadronic width at the @xmath14 pole , is subject to a correction from real and virtual axigluons  @xcite , of the form : @xmath58\\ ] ] where the function @xmath59 is calculated in ref .  @xcite . the particle data group  @xcite quotes a value of @xmath27 from various low energy data run up to @xmath56 as @xmath60 , while the extraction from the hadronic with of the @xmath14 at @xmath56 as @xmath61 . attributing the difference in the extracted values of @xmath27 to the axigluon gives abound on the @xmath62 term , such that @xmath63 .",
    "this implies that @xmath64 at the @xmath65 @xmath66 level , and that @xmath67 at the same confidence levels .",
    "should the agreement between the low energy and high energy extractions of @xmath27 increase , the corresponding lower limit on the axigluon mass would also increase .",
    "the existence of an axigluon is predicted in chiral color models .",
    "a low - mass axigluon is difficult to exclude in typical collider experiments ( _ e.g. _ , using di - jet data ) .",
    "other approaches must be used to rule out axigluons with masses below @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath2 decay , top production , unitarity bounds and associated production of a @xmath69 boson with an axigluon can exclude axigluons with mass below about @xmath57 .",
    "a comparison of @xmath27 as extracted in low energy experiments and high energy experiments can rule out an axigluon with a mass lower than @xmath70 .",
    "this completely closes the low - mass axigluon window , and when combined with the cdf limits , an axigluon with mass below about @xmath71 is not allowed .",
    "an axigluon , if it exists , is in the realm of @xmath72 physics .",
