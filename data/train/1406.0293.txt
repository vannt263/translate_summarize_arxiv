    "the understanding and appropriate modeling of the transport of charged energetic particles in turbulent magnetic fields remains one of the long - standing challenges in astrophysics and space physics .",

    "of particular interest in this context are galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) and jovian cosmic ray electrons . while the former traverse the whole three - dimensionally structured heliosphere and allow for studies of its large - scale variations as well as of the evolution of heliospheric turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "+ in order to exploit this natural laboratory in full , it is necessary reproduce the measurements with simulations that do contain as much as possible of the three - dimensional structure of the plasma background within which the cosmic rays are propagating .",
    "significant progress has been made regarding the modeling of the quiet solar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but much remains to be done to implement the many features that are structuring the solar wind and the heliospheric magnetic field , into transport models of cosmic rays .",
    "particularly interesting structures are the corotating interaction regions ( cirs ) that are formed during the interaction of fast solar wind streams from coronal holes with preceding slow solar wind and usually persist for several solar roations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these structures not only lead to particle acceleration , but also to the modulation of gcr and jovian electron spectra @xcite . indeed ulysses measurements , as described in , e.g. , @xcite , at high heliolatitudes during the first orbit of the spacecraft around the sun indicated that cirs represent the major constituent for the three - dimensional heliospheric structure close to solar minimum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a major surprise came from the measurements of accelerated energetic particles and gcrs that showed clear periodic signals even above the poles of the sun where no in situ signals of cirs were registered by the plasma or magnetic field instrument @xcite .",
    "electron measurements , however , indicate no variation at these region . it can be speculated that the differences are caused by the fact that both gcrs and locally accelerated particles have an extended source , while mev electrons in the inner heliosphere originate from a point - like source as mentioned above @xcite .",

    "while a recurrent structure of the electron intensities is present for the whole period shown in figure  [ fig-2 ] , the ulysses measurements only show such variation when the spacecraft is embedded in a cir region .",
    "a first analysis of the ephin measurements has been reported by @xcite , who showed that over half a year of measurements the electron flux can be correlated or anti - correlated with the solar wind speed depending on the spacecraft position relative to jupiter .",
    "@xcite investigated the spatial and temporal variation of these cir structures and concluded that the measurements are highly dependent on the spacecraft latitude and the evolution of the coronal hole structure .",

    "another quantity that can be derived from potential field models , the footpoint distance of an open field line to the nearest coronal hole boundary , was used by @xcite to empirically quantify the resulting solar wind speeds .",
    "combining such approaches and incorporating the schatten current sheet ( scs ) model @xcite to account for thin current sheets resulted in the so - called wang - sheeley - arge ( wsa ) model @xcite .",
    "a variety of versions of the wsa model predict solar wind speed distributions at different solar distances rather close to the sun from where the predictions must be propagated further outwards .",
    "earlier models used simple kinematic propagation schemes , while nowadays mhd codes are utilized since they can account for more physics needed , e.g. , for the proper modeling of stream interactions and shock formation .",
    "such combined models are in operation at space weather forecasting facilities such as the community coordinated modeling center ( ccmc ) or the space weather prediction center ( swpc ) . + the main advantage of the latter empirical models are their significantly reduced computational costs as compared to coronal mhd models .",
    "additionally , the empirical models avoid the problems arising due to sub - alfvnic solar wind speeds  complicating boundary conditions as perturbations may travel back towards the photosphere  and the issue of coronal heating .",
    "furthermore , it was demonstrated by @xcite that pfss solutions often closely match those obtained by numerical mhd models .",
    "+ in the present study , we are mainly interested in the influence of cirs on the transport of energetic particles from distant sources towards the earth ( galactic cosmic rays , jovian electrons ) , such that a detailed coronal model is not mandatory . in this light we postpone the implementation of a coronal mhd model to future studies and instead use the empirical wsa model as input to mhd simulations in a domain from 0.1  au to 10  au and possibly further out .",

    "this gives exactly the difference of @xmath68 to the left per panel , while the shocks propagate away from it .",
    "they encounter each other just before 4  au and a corotating merged interaction region ( cmir ) is formed .",
    "the shocks move through each other and propagate further at a lower relative speed , due to energy losses in the collision process @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to another compression region that is more pronounced than the original one at the si by 5  au and it continues to be the dominant structure out to 9  au , while the shocks weaken to pressure waves .",
    "this demonstrates the different dynamics : in the inner heliosphere it is momentum driven by streams , while beyond several au it is driven by the evolution and interaction of interaction regions and shocks @xcite .",
    "this rather simple setup will also provide a good first test for the sde transport modeling , because the relevant structures are regular and fairly easy to identify .",
    "having validated the numerical framework , we now seek to model more realistic solar wind conditions as present during a given period of time . with a focus on cirs , we chose a time period in late 2007 ( carrington rotations ( cr ) 2059 to 2061 ) when , due to coronal hole excursions to low latitudes , several fast wind streams were present in the otherwise slow ambient solar wind . because there were no transient events , this time period is also favorable for the present study as the used wsa model does not cover cmes .",
    "the wsa model relies on the topology of pfss models of the coronal magnetic field . to obtain the pfss solution , we used magnetograms obtained by the global oscillation network group ( gong ) of the national solar observatory ( nso ) ( http://gong.nso.edu/ ) as input to the `` finite difference iterative poisson solver '' ( fdips , @xcite ) .",

    "is introduced ( typically at @xmath73 ) beyond which the field is assumed to be purely radial .",
    "laplace s equation is commonly solved by series of spherical harmonics . while this provides a computationally cheap way to describe the large - scale coronal magnetic field ,",
    "an inherent disadvantage of the spherical harmonics approach is the occurence of ringing artifacts around sharp features when the order of spherical harmonics approaches the resolution of the magnetogram @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach using a finite difference scheme to solve laplace s equation was proposed by @xcite , and their code fdips was made publicly available ( http://csem.engin.umich.edu/tools/fdips/ ) .",

    "this is in contrast to observations that show sharp and thin current sheets at magnetic field polarity reversals . to overcome this problem",

    "we performed a rough tuning to be in better agreement with the spacecraft data and found for our setup more suitable values @xmath99  km / s , @xmath96  km / s , @xmath103 and @xmath104 $ ] , which are comparable to the values listed above . a more thorough tuning would go beyond",
    "the scope of this paper , and optimal parameters may vary for different crs .",
    "+ since potential field models systematically underestimate the magnetic flux @xcite , we apply a correction to the initial magnetic field for better accordance with 1  au data while keeping the orientation of @xmath105 .",
    "specifically , a value of 300  nt is applied for a respective solar wind speed of 625  km / s and linearly scaled for other speeds , as is done in the wsa - enlil model @xcite .",
    "additional estimates for mass flux and total pressure are obtained from omniweb ( http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) data by taking respective 27-day averaged values .",
    "these are then scaled with radial distance to the inner grid boundary and used for defining boundary conditions for density and temperature as described in @xcite . +",
    "the derived boundary conditions are assumed to remain stationary in the corotating frame during the evolution of a single cr so that the simulations can be advanced in time until a steady state is reached .",
    "the simulation box extends to 2  au in order to include ulysses at @xmath106  au during the time period considered , and also to study the formation of cir - associated shocks .",
    "the applied resolution is @xmath107 , and , since we focus on the validation of the results with spacecraft data , the simulation box is restricted to extend to 2  au only in the radial direction and to @xmath108 $ ] in latitude .",
    "this gives a runtime @xmath109 hours on a 64 core cluster , while the physical convergence time @xmath110 hours , which is estimated from the slowest wind ( @xmath111km / s ) to propagate to the outer boundary .",
    "taking the simulation to larger radial distances for usage in the sde code is straightforward , but requires the grid to be coarsened to maintain reasonable required computer resources .",
    "the polar regions could be included as well , but this would further restrict the global timestep in the simulations due to small cell sizes as @xmath112 towards the poles .",
    "the simulation results of the solar wind speed , density , and temperature as well as of the magnetic field are compared to spacecraft data of both the ulysses and the two stereo spacecraft .",
    "stereo - a(head ) leads earth while stereo - b(ehind ) trails earth . in detail",
    ", the ulysses data are based on measurements from the ulysses solar wind observations over the poles of the sun ( swoops , @xcite ) and the magnetometer onboard ( vhm , @xcite ) . for the stereo - a / b twin spacecraft , measurements were taken from the plasma and suprathermal ion composition ( plastic , @xcite ) instrument and the spacecraft s magnetometers ( mag , @xcite ) .",
    "+ we first discuss the results for cr 2060 and only briefly address the results for cr2059 and cr2061 presented afterwards .",
    "+ for a comparison with the spacecraft data the mhd results have been interpolated along respective spacecraft trajectories .",
    "panel ( a ) in figure [ fig : comp ] shows the resulting map for the radial velocity at the radial distance of the stereo - a spacecraft ( at @xmath113 au and separated in longitude from earth by less than 15@xmath65 , see http://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/where.shtml ) .",
    "the white line indicates its trajectory as the spacecraft traverses from right to left as indicated by the corresponding day of year ( doy ) used as the horizontal axis .",
    "a respective map for stereo - b is very similar to panel ( a ) and is , therefore , omitted .",
    "instead panel ( b ) shows the equivalent map for the ulysses spacecraft , which at that time performed a fast - latitude scan and was located at heliocentric distances of @xmath106  au .",
    "quantitative comparisons with the in situ measurements are presented in the bottom panels ( c)-(e ) , where the quantities shown are ( top to bottom ) radial velocity @xmath114 , particle number density @xmath42 , temperature @xmath54 , radial magnetic field @xmath115 , and magnetic field magnitude @xmath55 .",
    "the spacecraft data ( red lines ) have been averaged to the one degree angular resolution of the simulated data ( black lines ) .",
    "a quite good match is found along the orbit of stereo - b ( panel ( d ) ) , where the prominent high - speed streams centered around doys 239 and 246 are captured in terms of magnitude and stream width , while a third high - speed stream at doy 250 is somewhat underestimated .",
    "furthermore , the simulation data shows an additional feature at doy 236 , which is not present in the spacecraft data , and can be identified as an excursion of the northern coronal hole in panel ( a ) .",
    "a similar behavior is found for stereo - a .",
    "here we demonstrate the effect of artificially shifting the spacecraft position slightly ( 4@xmath65 south in latitude ) which results in the dashed blue curve .",
    "the comparison seems significantly improved as the additional features prominence is mitigated while the observed stream at doy 250 is now captured very acurately .",
    "this shows that a comparison strictly along a spacecraft trajectory may not always be satisfactory at first glance , but that a thorough inspection of such maps as presented in panels ( a ) and ( b ) can help identifying the actually observed ones , which may just be slightly off the trajectory in the simulation ( see section [ sec : conclusions ] for further discussion ) .",
    "the comparison with ulysses data for radial velocity is also somewhat dominated by the additional feature around doy 239 , however , apart from that the comparison is quite satisfactory throughout the course of this cr .",
    "+ the pressure associated quantities @xmath42 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 exhibit magnitudes of the correct order with respective strong enhancements in compression regions associated with the forming cirs at the leading edges of high - speed streams .",
    "the magnetic field strength , however , seems to be systematically underestimated and might have to be increased in future simulations .",
    "+ another interesting quantity is the radial magnetic field component , through which sector boundaries ( i.e.  current sheet crossings ) can be identified , which is difficult , however , due to rapid fluctuations in the spacecraft data .",
    "still , the average polarity and sector boundaries are captured fairly well , e.g.  for stereo - b , current sheet crossings occur at doy 243 and 250 in good agreement with the measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : comp2 ] shows results for cr2059 in the same format as figure [ fig : comp ] .",
    "most features are captured relatively well in the stereo comparisons with the largest deviations occuring at the beginning and end of this cr where the simulation data show a high - speed feature not seen in the measurements . a shift in latitude for stereo - a shows again that a small deviation from the actual trajectory gives better results and proves the presence of respective high - speed features , which are just slightly offset .",
    "the comparison with ulysses data shows excellent agreement .",
    "+ the results for cr2061 are shown in figure [ fig : comp3 ] which are similar to the ones for cr2060 along the stereo trajectories , and satisfactory agreement is found .",
    "ulysses , on its way to northern polar regions , encounters predominantly the fast solar wind coming from the respective northern coronal hole .",
    "the simulation data along its trajectory , however , does not show the return to slow - speed wind occuring twice .",
    "again , these are present in the global topology ( see panel ( b ) ) but are located too far south so that an 8@xmath65 degree shift south in latitude is necessary to produce results more similar to the measurements . + we believe to have found a reasonable agreement with spacecraft data at relatively small heliocentric distances and , therefore , we feel that the results we obtain at greater distances can be trusted to also be a good representation to the local solar wind conditions .",
    ".,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    an arising problem , however , is the common assumption of stationary boundary conditions during the course of a cr .",
    "on the one hand , this is reasonable for propagating solutions out to 1 - 2 au only , because the solar wind takes a relatively short time to propagate there ( @xmath116 days / au ) as compared to the duration of a cr ( @xmath117 days ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when extending the simulations to larger radial distances , stationary boundary conditions may become unreasonable if there is a significant change from one cr to the next one , because the propagation time becomes comparable to and eventually even larger than the duration of a cr , so that the heliosphere is filled with solar wind whose composition changes according to the different boundary conditions .",
    "this latter effect will have to be considered when we extend the simulation box to larger radial distances , so that time - dependent boundary conditions have to be applied .",
    "this will , however , take considerably longer computation time .",
    "a simpler approach appears to be possible for cr2060 - 2061 , because the boundary conditions change rather little and stationary boundary conditions still appear to be a reasonable assumption .",
    "a respective simulation was carried out applying constant inner radial boundary conditions of cr2060 and extending the simulation box in the radial direction to 10au with a resolution of @xmath118=[2r_\\odot,2^\\circ,2^\\circ]$ ] .",
    "+ an equatorial slice of the simulation box depicting radial velocity is shown in figure [ fig:2060_eq ] .",
    "three initially distinct high - speed streams can be identified that  with increasing heliocentric distance  begin to interact and form a cmir with a large angular extent .",
    "this is shown in a quantitative manner in figure [ fig:2060_evolution ] , which is similar to figure [ fig : pizzo_evolution ] as it shows radial velocity ( black solid ) and total pressure ( blue dashed ) at the equator at radial distances from 1.5 to 9.5  au .",
    "the horizontal axis uses a longitude , which is carrington longitude minus @xmath119 in order to show the evolution and interaction out to 6.5  au without hitting the longitudinal periodic boundary .",
    "only one of the three initial high - speed streams at 1.5  au shows a strong compression region at its stream interface ( si1 , green dashed - dotted ) . at 2.5  au two stream interfaces with",
    "respective forward ( fs orange , dashed / dotted ) and reverse shocks ( rs , red dashed / dotted ) propagating away from them can be seen .",
    "fs1 and rs2 move towards and finally through each other between 3.5 and 4.5  au and a cmir is formed , which further interacts with the third initial high - speed stream s shocks a little beyond 8  au .",
    "the only prominent structure left at 9.5  au is a large merged interaction region bounded by the forward and reverse shocks ( fs1 and rs1 ) of the initially steepest high - speed feature with a complicated internal structure as a result of the merging process .",
    "the influence of such complicated structures on particle transport will be interesting to investigate .",
    "we demonstrated the capability of the mhd code cronos to model cir - associated structures ( compression regions , shock pairs ) in a test case where we are in agreement with the earlier results by @xcite . to model more realistic solar wind conditions , we used gong magnetograms and the fdips potential field solution as input to the wsa model to derive inner boundary conditions for our mhd code . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that the wsa model is used in conjuction with the fdips model , which can make use of the full resolution of a given magnetogram without introducing numerical artifacts that can arise in the usual spherical harmonics expansion of the coronal potential field .",
    "our results could be shown to be in reasonable agreement with spacecraft data .",
    "+ other studies have looked at cr2060 using input from the wsa model . in one example",
    ", @xcite validated their findings by comparison with ace and messenger spacecraft data , though no comparison with ulysses data was performed to validate out - of - ecliptic results .",
    "the agreement of the in - ecliptic results is comparable to the one found here .",
    "ulysses comparisons for this time period were performed by @xcite , but the focus was on single cir structures instead of investigating the whole cr .",
    "therefore , in performing simulations to reproduce simultaneous multi - spacecraft observations including out - of - ecliptic data and also considering temporally adjacent crs our modeling extends previous work and provides a suitable framework for a subsequent study of 3d energetic particle transport .",
    "+ there are several reasons for occasional deviations when directly comparing simulation results to spacecraft in situ measurements which can essentially be attributed to the simplifications made in the model . amongst others",
    "the following reasons can be listed : first , it has been shown that results using input from different solar observatories may differ quite substantially @xcite . along this track @xcite",
    "investigated an ensemble modeling technique taking into account results from different models and observatories , which when combined give a better solution .",
    "secondly , the empirical formulas used to set the inner radial boundary conditions are not well constrained and need some tuning that may depend on the observatories input data and the phase of the solar cycle .",
    "similarly , the pfss and scs models are rather crude estimates of the inner and outer coronal fields , and are also subject to empirical parameters such as the source surface radius , which may not be constant as commonly assumed , but may vary depending on angular position @xcite and solar cycle @xcite . a tuning of all these parameters could be performed to diminish differences between simulations and in - situ measurements , however , this does not give insight into the underlying physics on the one hand , and is also a very time consuming undertaking on the other hand .",
    "thirdly , since the whole solar surface is not visible from earth at a given time , synoptic magnetograms always contain non - simultaneous observations .",
    "flux - transport models ( e.g.  @xcite ) may be an effective tool to model the unobserved hemisphere of the sun and improve magnetograms , however .",
    "these are not implemented in our model , but may be subject to future work . + a related problem is the common assumption of stationary boundary conditions during the course of a cr . while this remains reasonable for propagating solutions out to about 1  au only  because the solar wind s crossing time is much smaller than the duration of a cr  it becomes necessary to apply time - dependent boundary conditions when extending the simulations to larger radial distances so that the heliosphere is filled with solar wind with composition changes according to the changing coronal conditions .",
    "+ this latter effect will have to be considered when we extend the simulation box to larger radial distances , so that time - dependent boundary conditions may have to be applied .",
    "this will , however , take considerably longer computation time .",
    "a simpler approach presented here was taken for cr2060 - 2061 , because the boundary conditions change rather little and stationary boundary conditions might still be a reasonable assumption .",
    "time - dependent simulations and the inclusion of the poles will be adressed in an upcoming paper , where we will utilize the modeled 3d solar wind structure to investigate the transport of energetic particles , such as jovian electrons and galactic cosmic rays .    financial support for the project fi 706/8 - 2 ( within research unit 1048 ) , as well as for the projects fi 706/14 - 1 and he 3279/15 - 1 funded by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft",

    "<S> the transport of energetic particles such as cosmic rays is governed by the properties of the plasma being traversed . while these properties are rather poorly known for galactic and interstellar plasmas due to the lack of in situ measurements , the heliospheric plasma environment has been probed by spacecraft for decades and provides a unique opportunity for testing transport theories . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest for the 3d heliospheric transport of energetic particles are structures such as corotating interaction regions ( cirs ) , which , due to strongly enhanced magnetic field strengths , turbulence , and associated shocks , can act as diffusion barriers on the one hand , but also as accelerators of low energy crs on the other hand as well . in a two - fold series of papers we investigate these effects by modeling inner - heliospheric solar wind conditions with a numerical magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) setup ( this paper ) , which will serve as an input to a transport code employing a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) approach ( second paper ) . in this first paper we present results from 3d mhd simulations with our code cronos : for validation purposes we use analytic boundary conditions and compare with similar work by pizzo . for a more realistic modeling of solar wind conditions , boundary conditions derived from synoptic magnetograms via the wang - sheeley - arge </S>",
