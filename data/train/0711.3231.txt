    "the field of highly frustrated magnetism has received a growing theoretical and experimental interest in recent years  @xcite .",
    "one of the central motifs in the planar kagom and similarly frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnets ( afm s ) which readily differentiates them from unfrustrated ( e.g. collinear ) ones , is the proliferation of an extensive family of low - energy singlets below the lowest triplet excitation  @xcite .",
    "one interpretation for the origin of these singlets has emerged from resonating valence bond ( rvb ) type of arguments  @xcite for the @xmath2 kagom afm . for higher spins",
    ", purely classical considerations assert that the singlets stem from the splitting by quantum fluctuations of the extensively degenerate family of nel ordered ( 3-sublattice ) ground states  @xcite .",
    "both interpretations rest on the notion of a local degeneracy which stems from the frustrated corner - sharing topology of these lattices . in this regard",
    ", it appears that the proliferation of singlets is only one particular manifestation of this local degeneracy since similarly dense low - energy excitations are manifested in the whole magnetization range .    on the other hand ,",
    "some understanding for the ground state itself has been established .",
    "exact diagonalization ( ed ) results suggest that the ground state of the @xmath2 kagom afm is a disordered spin liquid with a very small spin gap  @xcite ( if any ) . for @xmath7",
    ", semi - classical approaches predict that an extensive subset of coplanar states is first selected in @xmath8 while the @xmath9 ordered state is stabilized in higher orders through the order - by - disorder mechanism  @xcite . in a magnetic field ,",
    "the ground state may exhibit a number of interesting phases .",
    "these include the presence of an extensively degenerate family of localized magnons which result in macroscopic magnetization jumps at the saturation field , as well as the stabilization of spin gaps and the associated fractional magnetization plateaux . for a first understanding of the nature of these plateaux a perturbative expansion around the degenerate ising point",
    "was first employed by cabra _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the kagom .",
    "this approach was recently extended by bergman _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to other frustrated systems , such as the pyrochlore afm . here ,",
    "the anisotropy terms are treated perturbatively , and the emerging splitting of the degenerate ising manifold is effectively cast into a quantum dimer model ( qdm ) on the dual lattice .    at the same time",
    ", it is well known that some precursors of the excitation spectra of frustrated and unfrustrated afm s are already embodied in the spectra of small system sizes ( see for instance ref .  ) .",
    "it has come therefore with no surprise that a number of phenomena that are manifest in kagom - like afm s have also emerged in the research field of highly frustrated nanomagnets  @xcite .",
    "these are realizations of zero - dimensional molecular - size magnets which consist of a finite number of strongly interacting transition metal ions , with the isotropic heisenberg exchange being the dominant energy term .",
    "thus , in addition to their great relevance in the context of nanomagnetism and the growing interest for potential applications in quantum computing  @xcite , information storage  @xcite and magnetic imaging  @xcite , molecular nanomagnets can also provide a suitable platform for addressing theoretical questions and testing ideas from the more general context of frustrated magnetism .         in this work",
    ", we focus on two magnetic molecule realizations of the heisenberg kagom afm on the sphere .",
    "the first consists of @xmath10 corner - sharing triangles and is realized in the cu@xmath11la@xmath12  @xcite cluster with @xmath13 cu@xmath14 @xmath2 ions occupying the vertices of a symmetric cuboctahedron ( cf.fig .",
    "[ cubocicosi.fig ] ) .",
    "the spin topology of this cluster is identical to the @xmath13-site kagom wrapped on a torus ( cf .",
    "[ cubocontheplane.fig ] ) .",
    "the second cluster is one of the largest frustrated molecules synthesized to date , namely the giant keplerate mo@xmath5fe@xmath6 system  @xcite .",
    "this features an array of thirty @xmath4 fe@xmath15 ions occupying the vertices of twenty corner - sharing triangles spanning an almost perfect icosidodecahedron ( cf.fig .",
    "[ cubocicosi.fig ] ) .",
    "interestingly , its quantum @xmath2 analogue , mo@xmath5v@xmath6 , consisting of v@xmath16 ions has also been synthesized quite recently  @xcite .",
    "we may note here that the cuboctahedron and the icosidodecahedron can be thought of as two existing positive curvature ( with @xmath17 4 and 5 respectively ) counterparts of elser and zeng s  @xcite generalization of the kagom structure on the hyperbolic plane where each hexagon is replaced by a polygon of @xmath18 sides with @xmath19 .    among the above highly frustrated clusters ,",
    "mo@xmath5fe@xmath6 has been the most investigated so far , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the exchange interactions in mo@xmath5fe@xmath6 are quite small , @xmath20 k  @xcite , and this has allowed for the experimental observation of a @xmath21 plateau at @xmath22 tesla which has been explained classically by schrder _",
    "et al . _",
    "in addition , this cluster manifests a very broad inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) response as shown by garlea _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "mo@xmath5v@xmath6 has a much stronger afm exchange @xmath23 k  @xcite , and thus is not well suited for the observation of the field - induced plateau .",
    "however , its low - energy excitation spectrum can still be investigated by ins experiments ( which , to our knowledge , have not been performed so far ) . as to the @xmath2 cuboctahedron cu@xmath11la@xmath12  @xcite , we are not aware of any magnetic measurements reported so far on this cluster .",
    "the main magnetic properties of the present clusters can be explained very well by the isotropic heisenberg model with a single afm exchange parameter @xmath24 , i.e. [ heis.eq ] = j _ ij _",
    "i_j  , where , as usual , @xmath25 denotes pairs of mutually interacting spins @xmath3 at sites @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "other terms such as single - ion anisotropy ( for @xmath7 ) or dzyaloshinsky - moriya interactions must be present as well in the present clusters , but they are expected to be much smaller than the exchange interactions and thus they can be neglected . here , as a simple theoretical tool to understand some of the properties of the heisenberg model , it will be very expedient to introduce some fictitious exchange anisotropy , i.e. extend eq .",
    "( [ heis.eq ] ) to its more general xxz variant @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 denote the transverse and longitudinal exchange parameters respectively . in what follows",
    "we denote @xmath31 .",
    "the main results presented in this article are of direct relevance to the experimental findings in mo@xmath5fe@xmath6 mentioned above and thus span two major themes .",
    "the first deals with the nature of the low - lying excitations above the @xmath21 plateau phase . for the @xmath2 icosidodecahedron we show that all these excitations are adiabatically connected to collinear `` up - up - down '' ( henceforth `` uud '' ) ising ground states ( gs s ) , at the same time being well isolated from higher levels by a relatively large energy gap .",
    "we argue that this feature must be special to the topology of the icosidodecahedron and that it must survive for @xmath4 as well .",
    "this prediction can be verified experimentally by a measurement of the low - temperature specific heat and the associated entropy content at the plateau phase of mo@xmath5fe@xmath6 .",
    "a complementary physical picture will emerge by performing a high order perturbative expansion in @xmath32 , in the spirit of refs .  , and by deriving and solving to lowest order the corresponding effective qdm on the dual clusters .",
    "the dependence of the model parameters on @xmath32 and @xmath3 is also found and given explicitly .",
    "our second theme concerns the origin of the broad ins response reported for mo@xmath5fe@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "previous theories based on the excitations of the rotational band model  @xcite or on spin wave calculations  @xcite predict a small number of discrete excitation lines at low temperatures and thus can not explain the broad ins features .",
    "our interpretation of this behavior is based on the notion of the simultaneous presence of several rotational bands or towers of states at low energies which originate from the large degree of classical degeneracy , a generic feature of highly frustrated systems .",
    "indeed , our exact diagonalizations demonstrate the existence of an unusually high density of low - energy excitations manifesting in the full magnetization range .",
    "a detailed group theory analysis reveals that the low - energy spectra are of semiclassical origin up to a relatively large energy cutoff .",
    "we will also show that the symmetry of the corresponding excitations for @xmath2 does not conform with this semiclassical picture .",
    "a quite appealing feature of these molecular clusters is their high point group symmetry , namely the full octahedral group @xmath33 ( with 48 elements ) and the full icosahedral group @xmath34 ( with 120 elements ) for the cuboctahedron and the icosidodecahedron respectively ( here @xmath35 denotes the inversion ) .",
    "this allows for a drastic reduction of the dimensionality of the problem . in order to fully exploit all symmetry operations",
    "we have employed a generalization  @xcite of the standard ed technique  @xcite so as to treat higher than one - dimensional irreducible representations ( ir s ) also . with this approach ,",
    "one is able to classify the energy levels according to both @xmath36 and the ir of the point group while resolving their full degeneracy .",
    "the remainder of the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ col_vs_kagome.sec ] we discuss some of the spectral features of the present kagom - like nanomagnets ( with particular emphasis on localized magnons ) and contrast them to typical spectra of unfrustrated afm s .",
    "this is illustrated by comparing with a simple 12-site bipartite @xmath2 cluster .",
    "the investigation of the nature of the @xmath21 plateau is presented in sec .",
    "[ plateau.sec ] .",
    "this includes both analytical and numerical results from high order degenerate perturbation theory around the ising limit , the construction of the associated effective qdm s and their extrapolation to the heisenberg limit .",
    "we also discuss the case of higher @xmath3 and the connection to the plateau phase of mo@xmath5fe@xmath6 . in sec .",
    "[ coplanarity.sec ] we demonstrate the presence of several low - energy rotational bands in @xmath7 heisenberg spectra and reveal their semiclassical origin .",

    "@xcite on this subject in the context of the triangular and kagom afm .",
    "predictions for the corresponding tower of states are also given for the ( @xmath7 ) icosidodecahedron .",
    "our core idea of the presence of several rotational bands due to the large spatial degeneracy of the classical states is also exemplified in sec .",

    "we leave sec .",
    "[ discussion.sec ] for an overview of the major findings of this work . in order",
    "for the manuscript to be self - contained , we include two appendices . in appendix  [ dpt.app ]",
    "we summarize the main aspects of the degenerate perturbation expansion around the ising limit , while in appendix  [ tower.app ] we give the details of the derivation of the full symmetry properties of the semiclassical towers of states for the heisenberg and the xy model .",
    "a special remark is in order here regarding our choice of presentation of the spectra . since we are interested in the low - energy excitations in the whole magnetization range ( these are the most accessible and thus most relevant as one ramps up an external field at low temperatures ) and in order to best illustrate the central features , we have chosen to ( except for fig .",
    "[ 12mer_tower.fig ] ) shift the lowest energy @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 ) of each @xmath36 ( @xmath39 ) sector to zero .",

    "our main purpose in this section is to present the low - energy spectra of the @xmath2 heisenberg cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron and to highlight their main features which are common in all frustrated afm s . for comparison ,",
    "it is expedient to also present the energy spectrum of a bipartite unfrustrated magnet . to this end",
    ", we have chosen the hypothetical 12-site cluster depicted in fig .",
    "[ 12mer.fig ] .",
    "the symmetry of this cluster is the dihedral group @xmath40 which consists of 24 elements .",

    "the spectrum is typical of unfrustrated afm s  @xcite of finite size @xmath43 .",

    "the ir s of @xmath63 can be generally labeled  @xcite by a non - negative integer @xmath18 or @xmath64 , with an additional label @xmath65 for @xmath66 which stands for the parity under the mirror operation .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> we present a detailed study of the low - energy excitations of two existing finite - size realizations of the planar kagom heisenberg antiferromagnet on the sphere , the cuboctahedron and the icosidodecahedron . after highlighting a number of special spectral features ( such as the presence of low - lying singlets below the first triplet and the existence of localized magnons ) we focus on two major issues . </S>",
    "<S> the first concerns the nature of the excitations above the plateau phase at @xmath0 of the saturation magnetization @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our exact diagonalizations for the @xmath2 icosidodecahedron reveal that the low - lying plateau states are adiabatically connected to the degenerate collinear `` up - up - down '' ground states of the ising point , at the same time being well isolated from higher excitations . </S>",
    "<S> a complementary physical picture emerges from the derivation of an effective quantum dimer model which reveals the central role of the topology and the intrinsic spin @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also give a prediction for the low energy excitations and thermodynamic properties of the spin @xmath4 icosidodecahedron mo@xmath5fe@xmath6 . in the second part we focus on the low - energy spectra of the @xmath7 heisenberg model in view of interpreting the broad inelastic neutron scattering response reported for mo@xmath5fe@xmath6 . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the simultaneous presence of several broadened low - energy `` towers of states '' or `` rotational bands '' which arise from the large discrete spatial degeneracy of the classical ground states , a generic feature of highly frustrated clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this semiclassical interpretation is further corroborated by their striking symmetry pattern which is shown , by an independent group theoretical analysis , to be a characteristic fingerprint of the classical coplanar ground states . </S>"
