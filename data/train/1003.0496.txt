    "the sze signal is essentially redshift independent , making it particularly useful for determining the evolution of large - scale structure .    for upcoming sze cluster surveys",
    "@xcite , it is important to investigate the relations between sze flux density and other cluster properties , such as mass , temperature , and gas fraction . by assuming that the evolution of clusters is dominated by self - similar gravitational processes",

    "due to the limited @xmath10 space sampling , the amiba data do not provide useful constraints on the structural parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath11 , in a full iterative model fitting .",
    "instead , we adopt @xmath1 and @xmath11 from published x - ray fits and use a markov chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) method to determine the cluster properties ( @xmath12 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "we also estimate these cluster properties from amiba data with structural constraints from x - ray data using the non - isothermal universal temperature profile model @xcite .",
    "all quantities are integrated to spherical radius @xmath6 within which the mean over - density of the cluster is @xmath13  times the critical density at the cluster s redshift .",
    "we then investigate the scaling relations between these cluster properties derived from the sze data , and identify correlations between those properties that are induced by the iterative method .",

    "the temperatures of clusters obtained using the utp model are lower than those obtained with the isothermal model and thus are in better agreement with those deduced from x - ray data .",
    "therefore , in the utp model , with similar @xmath331 and lower temperature , we should get larger @xmath175 .",
    "the electron temperatures derived using the utp @xmath1 model are in better agreement with x - ray observation results than those derived using the isothermal @xmath1 model .",
    "this result implies that the utp @xmath1 model may provide better estimates of the electron temperature when we can use only the @xmath1 model parameters from x - ray observation .",
    "however , we noticed that the utp @xmath1 model produced larger errorbars than the isothermal @xmath1 model did .",
    "these increased errors are based on the uncertainties of @xmath1 and @xmath209 which we insert by hand . on the other hand , because we treat @xmath1 and @xmath209 as independent parameters in this work , the uncertainty could be over estimated due to the degeneracy between these two parameters .",
    "if we can access to the likelihood distributions of @xmath1 and @xmath209 of the utp @xmath1 model derived from observation , the error - bars might be reduced significantly .",
    "there is a concern that the scaling relations among the purely sze - derived cluster properties may be implicitly embedded in the formalism we used here . in this paper",
    ", we also investigate for the first time the embedded scaling relations between the sze - derived cluster properties .",
    "our analytical and numerical analyses both suggest that there are embedded scaling relations between sze - derived cluster properties , with both the isothermal model and the utp model , while we fix @xmath1 .",
    "the embedded @xmath5-@xmath336 and @xmath337-@xmath336 scaling relations are close to the predictions of self - similar model .",
    "the results imply that the assumptions built in the pure - sze method significantly affect the scaling relation between the sze - derived properties .",
    "therefore , we should treat those scaling relations carefully .",
    "our results suggest the possibility of measuring cluster parameters with sze observation alone .",
    "the agreement between our results and those from the literature provides not only confidence for our project but also supports our understanding of galaxy clusters .",
    "the upcoming expanded amiba with higher sensitivity and better resolution will significantly improve the constraints on these cluster properties .",
    "in addition , an improved determination of the @xmath18-@xmath19 space structure of the clusters directly from amiba will make it possible to measure the properties of clusters which currently do not have good x - ray data .",
    "the ability to estimate cluster properties based on sze data will improve the study of mass distribution at high redshifts .",
    "on the other hand , the fact that the assumptions of cluster mass and temperature profiles significantly bias the estimations of scaling relations should be also noticed and treated carefully .",
