    "vera ( vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ) , led by naoj in cooperation with several japanese universities , is a vlbi array to aim for obtaining 3-dimensional map of the milky way galaxy .",
    "it consists of four 20-m antennas located at mizusawa , iriki , ogasawara and ishigaki in japan , to achieve baselines longer than 1000 km up to 2300 km .",
    "kvn ( korean vlbi network ) , promoted by kasi , is the first dedicated mm - wavelength vlbi array , which consists of three 21-m antennas located at yonsei ( seoul ) , ulsan and tamna ( jeju island ) .",
    "the baseline length ranges between 300 and 500 km .",
    "on the basis of the vlbi collaboration agreement between kasi and naoj , we have started the joint observation with the kvn+vera array .",
    "the kvn+vera array complements baseline length range up to 2300 km fully , and can achieve a good imaging quality .",
    "the early phase observations have been carried out using the k4/vsop terminal at 128 mbps sampling , alternatively .",

    "the imaging test observations at 22 ghz toward a continuum radio source 1928 + 738 were carried out on 26 january 2011 with the kvn+vera array .",
    "this source is known to exhibit an extended jet structure along the north - south direction @xcite .",
    "the kvn+vera image succeeds to detect the extended jet structure toward south , although the vera image at 22 ghz does not show the structure clearly .",

    "two vlbi images of 1928 + 738 obtained by ( a ) the kvn+vera and ( b ) the vera only . achieved image rms level is ( a ) 2.67 mjy beam@xmath0 and ( b ) 5.34 mjy beam@xmath0 , respectively .",

    "distribution and velocity field of sio @xmath1=2 maser spots in the image obtained by the kvn+vera array are consistent with the image in 2008 with the vera @xcite .",
    "the number of detected maser spots ( @xmath2 ) are around 250 , and it is twice more than the vera image in spite of shorter observation time .",
    "kasi and naoj have been developing compatible data acquisition system and a common correlator , kjjvc ( korea - japan joint vlbi correlator ) .",
    "kjjvc is able to process 16 stations , at the maximum sampling rate of 8 gbps / station .",
    "kjjvc can accept data from several different vlbi playback systems such as mark 5b , vera2000 and k-5 , and correlate gbps sampling data between the kvn mark 5b and the vera2000 backend terminals @xcite .",

    "the elevation dependence of the aperture efficiency of the kvn and vera antennas was measured by observing bright h@xmath3o and sio maser sources at 22 and 43ghz . for both of kvn and vera ,",
