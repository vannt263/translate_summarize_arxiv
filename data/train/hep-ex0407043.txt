    "apart from the familiar @xmath3 and @xmath2 mesons , the existence of three more weakly decaying @xmath8 hadrons has been firmly established : the @xmath0 and @xmath9 mesons and one baryon , the @xmath1 .",
    "other weakly decaying hadrons have been predicted but have not yet been unambiguously observed : the @xmath10 , the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 .    while our primary physics interest is focused on the @xmath4-quark , there are three good reasons why the spectator quark plays a major role in the study of the @xmath4-quark :    * * the spectator quark can make or break a cp eigenstate*. a @xmath0 has a large branching ratio to the cp - even @xmath13 final state , through the cabbibo - favored transition .",
    "since this final state is accessible by both @xmath0 and @xmath14 , it contributes to the lifetime difference between the heavy and the light @xmath0 mass eigenstates .",
    "the equivalent decay of the @xmath2 results in a @xmath15 final state , which is flavor - specific , and the lifetime difference in the @xmath2 system is negligible . *",
    "* the spectator quark can exchange @xmath16 s with the @xmath4 quark*. the most dramatic consequence of this are oscillations : through the exchange of two @xmath17 , the @xmath2 and the @xmath0 can transform into their own anti - particle .",
    "the @xmath0 oscillates more than 20 times faster than the @xmath2 , whose oscillation frequency is suppressed due to the tiny ckm matrix element @xmath18 . *",
    "* the spectator quark can annihilate with the @xmath4-quark*. this process is dominated by loop - diagrams involving the top - quark .",
    "the decay of a @xmath0 into two muons is expected to occur with a branching ratio larger by @xmath19 compared to @xmath20 .",
    "rare decays and cp violation are not discussed here , since they are covered elsewhere in these proceedings  @xcite .",
    "the present @xmath8 factories operate at the @xmath23 resonance which produces only @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the next resonance , the @xmath24 , is heavy enough to produce @xmath0 mesons .",
    "however , the @xmath0 cross - section at the @xmath24 is an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath2 production at the @xmath23  @xcite , thus making it challenging to collect a competitive number of @xmath0 decays .",
    "there are two other practical means of producing the @xmath21 and the @xmath1 :    * * @xmath25 at the @xmath5 pole*. each of the 4 lep experiments has recorded about @xmath26 events , and have contributed significantly to our knowledge of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the sample produced at the stanford linear collider ( slc ) is smaller by an order of magnitude , but profited from the superior vertex resolution and from the beam polarization .",
    "the latter gives a strong correlation between the production hemisphere and the charge sign of the @xmath4 quark and provides an efficient flavor - tag , a key advantage for oscillation studies .",
    "* * high - energy hadron colliders*. the tevatron , a @xmath27 collider at 1.96tev center of mass energy , is presently operational and has a @xmath28 cross - section that is about @xmath29 of the total inelastic cross - section . in 2007 the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in genve will provide an abundant source of @xmath8 hadrons .",
    "proton - proton collisions at a center - of - mass energy of 14tev produce a @xmath28 pair roughly every hundred interactions .    in both of the above mentioned cases ,",
    "the production fractions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are approximately 10% each , while @xmath9 production is suppressed at the @xmath29 level .",
    "the types of @xmath8 decays that can be reconstructed at a hadron collider can be distinguished into three classes :    * * semileptonic decays * , for example .",
    "these have large branching fractions , and large yields can be obtained simply by triggering on a lepton , but the missing neutrino prohibits complete reconstruction . moreover",
    ", semileptonic decays can not result in a cp eigenstates , and do not give access to many of the most interesting @xmath8 physics channels . *",
    "* @xmath8 decays with a @xmath30 in the final state * , for example .",
    "these have the advantage of providing a clear signature for the trigger , through the dimuon decay of the @xmath30 . however , the sum of all branching ratios with a @xmath30 in the final state is only slightly more than one percent . *",
    "* hadronic decays * , such as , .",
    "these constitute about three quarters of all @xmath8 decays and offer a rich variety of @xmath8 physics . however , they are difficult to distinguish from the overwhelming background of hadronic interactions without heavy flavor .",
    "its main signature are displaced tracks , and to collect large samples of fully reconstructed hadronic @xmath8 decays requires specialized triggers that are capable of reading out and processing data from a silicon vertex detector at high speed .",
    "both the cdf and the detectors are well equipped for a rich @xmath8 physics program : both have silicon detectors , high resolution trackers in a magnetic field , and lepton identification .",
    "profits from its hermetic muon coverage and its efficient tracking in the forward regions , giving a high sensitivity for semileptonic and @xmath30 modes .",
    "cdf has better track momentum resolution , a high - bandwidth silicon track trigger , and particle identification capabilities through time - of - flight counters and @xmath31 measurements in its main drift chamber .",
    "two new specialized @xmath8 experiments may dramatically improve our knowledge of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 : the lhcb experiment , starting in 2007 at the lhc , and the btev experiment , starting in 2009 at the tevatron .",
    "both experiments use a dipole spectrometer and are instrumented at small angles with respect to the beam . using the forward region",
    "has many advantages :    * the useful cross - section is higher , because of the large acceptance at small transverse momentum .",
    "* often both @xmath8 s are in the detector acceptance , giving a high efficiency for flavor - tagging . *",
    "the boost in the direction of the beam allows to accurately measure the decay time in the beam direction . *",
    "the forward detector geometry allows to install rich imaging cerenkov detectors for superb particle identification .",
    "a typical mass peak of 200 fully reconstructed events with an experimental resolution of 15mev gives a mass measurement with a statistical uncertainty of @xmath321mev .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 have now been observed in fully reconstructed decay modes , but the @xmath9 has only been observed in the semileptonic decay , and the mass has an uncertainty of more than 400mev .",
    "this can be dramatically improved by observing the @xmath9 in fully reconstructed decay modes such as .",
    "preliminary @xmath0 and @xmath1 mass measurements from cdf , shown in figure  [ fig : mass ] , significantly improve the previous best measurements . to achieve mass measurements at the 1mev level ,",
    "the mass scale needs to be understood to @xmath33 .",

    "[ fig : mass ] _ , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]",
    "to first order , @xmath8-hadron lifetimes are determined by the fastest decaying quark : @xmath36 spectator effects can be calculated in the heavy quark expansion , but have been determined to be small : the dominant contributions scale with @xmath37 .",
    "a recent calculation includes @xmath38 contributions  @xcite and finds : @xmath39 the best lifetime measurements of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 come from semileptonic decays at cdf - i and lep .",
    "the current world average  @xcite is : @xmath40 semileptonic measurements , however , suffer from incomplete reconstruction due to the missing neutrino .",
    "this introduces irreducible systematic uncertainties both from the production model and from the decay model .",
    "fully reconstructed @xmath8 decays are not affected by model - dependencies , since the lifetime is measured on an event - by - event basis , but they provide smaller statistics .",
    "both and cdf have recently measured the lifetimes of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 in fully reconstructed modes with a precision similar to the semileptonic measurements : @xmath41 the last one represents the first measurement of the @xmath1 lifetime from fully reconstructed decays . in the near future",
    "these measurements will be updated with more data , and we can expect lifetime measurements from semileptonic and hadronic modes .",
    "because of mixing , the time evolution of neutral @xmath8 mesons is not governed by the flavor eigenstates @xmath42 , @xmath43 , but by the mass eigenstates @xmath44 , @xmath45 , which may differ not only in mass , but also in decay width by @xmath46 . for non - zero @xmath47 , the decay time distribution follows a double instead of a single exponential .",
    "if the @xmath21 mixing phase is as small as predicted , @xmath48 , the @xmath0 mass eigenstates coincide almost exactly with the cp eigenstates .",
    "a significant lifetime difference is then expected from the cabibbo - favored transition that results in a large fraction of final states that are cp even and common to @xmath0 and @xmath14 .",
    "a recent calculation  @xcite predicts @xmath49 , consistent with the experimental world - average value @xmath50 , obtained under the assumption that @xmath51 , or @xmath52 without this constraint  @xcite .",
    "three methods are available to measure @xmath6 :    1 .",
    "take a cp - mixed decay , and fit the lifetime distribution to a double exponential .",
    "a disadvantage is that this is sensitive to @xmath53 , making it difficult to probe small values of @xmath6 .",
    "2 .   compare the @xmath0 lifetime in a cp - even to a cp - odd or cp - mixed state .",
    "@xmath8 decays to two spin-1 particles , such as , can be decomposed through an angular analysis into cp - odd and cp - even states .",
    "since the lifetime difference is dominated by the decay , measurements of these branching fractions provide an indirect measurement of @xmath6 .",
    "cdf has recently completed a preliminary angular analysis of , extracting three complex amplitudes , the short - lived cp - even @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and the long - lived cp - odd @xmath56 , finding : @xmath57 this shows that is mostly cp - even , but also has a significant cp - odd component , making it possible to measure @xmath6 from this channel alone .",
    "the strongly suppressed transitions probe the ckm matrix element @xmath58 and its phase , often called @xmath59 . in practice , interfering contributions from penguin decays complicate precision measurements of @xmath59 from charmless @xmath8 decays .",
    "comparing various two - body decays of @xmath0 and @xmath2 allows to disentangle the tree and penguin contributions  @xcite .",
    "the challenge of reconstructing 2-body @xmath8 decays at a hadron collider resides both in rejecting large backgrounds and in distinguishing for example a decay from a decay without strong particle identification . using specific ionization in their drift chamber , cdf achieves a @xmath60 separation of @xmath61 , enough to disentangle the four main contributions to the peak in their @xmath62 histogram , and measures @xmath63 .",
    "this measurement is related to the direct cp violation in decays and was found to agree with the standard model expectation  @xcite .",
    "the same data have also been used to search for the charmless decay .",
    "the predicted branching ratios , for and for  @xcite , are considerably lower than the best experimental upper limit : @xmath64 at 90%cl  @xcite .",
    "cdf finds no evidence for a signal and improves the upper limit to @xmath65 at 90%cl .",

    "plot with the pion mass assumption for both tracks , indicating the search window for .",
    "the peak at @xmath66gev is dominated by @xmath67 decays used for normalization .",
    "[ fig : mpipi_lambdab ] _ , width=377 ]    particularly interesting charmless decays come from the pure penguin transition , since the belle collaboration has observed a @xmath68 deviation from the expected value of the weak phase in the @xmath69 channel  @xcite .",
    "cdf observes 12 candidates with an expected background of @xmath70 events , constituting the first in @xmath0 decays .",
    "they measure , where the last uncertainty comes from that is used as a normalization mode .",
    "the measured branching fraction is consistent with the wide range of predictions , which cover the range @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "the large branching ratio , combined with a distinct and low - background experimental signature , promises a bright future for this channel including angular analyses , measurements of @xmath6 , and cp violation .",
    "the well - measured @xmath2 oscillations provide a measurement of the ckm element @xmath72 , but the extraction is plagued by theoretical uncertainties .",
    "a more accurate measurement can be obtained by measuring also the @xmath0 oscillation frequency and use  @xcite @xmath73 where the last ( asymmetric ) uncertainty comes from the chiral extrapolation . seen the other way around , the standard model gives an accurate prediction of @xmath7 , and many new physics models allow significantly larger values  @xcite . in addition , a precise measurement of @xmath7 is a prerequisite for many time - dependent cp violation studies in the @xmath0 system .",
    "the present experimental lower limit is @xmath74ps@xmath75  @xcite , implying more than three full @xmath0 oscillation cycles within one lifetime .",
    "because of these very fast oscillations , the precise measurement of the proper decay time is of crucial importance : since the uncertainty on the oscillation amplitude scales like @xmath76 , a proper time resolution larger than 67fs@xmath75 seriously affects the sensitivity above 15ps@xmath75 .",
    "the first ingredient for mixing is a large @xmath0 yield .",

    "[ fig : bs_yields ] _ , title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    another crucial ingredient for any mixing measurement is flavor tagging , to determine whether a @xmath0 or a @xmath14 was produced .",
    "this information can be obtained either from the fragmentation tracks of the @xmath0 under study ( `` same side tag '' ) , or from the decay products of the @xmath4 quark that is produced in association with the @xmath0 ( `` opposite side tag '' ) .",
    "the effectiveness of a flavor tagger is usually expressed in its efficiency @xmath77 and its `` dilution factor '' @xmath78 , where @xmath16 is the fraction of wrong charge assignments .",
    "the statistical power of a flavor tagger scales as @xmath79 .",
    "contrary to @xmath8 physics at the @xmath80 , where values of @xmath81 are readily achieved , the flavor taggers at hadron colliders rarely exceed an @xmath79 of one percent .    both and cdf have shown non - zero dilutions for opposite side muon and jet - charge taggers .",
    "both have also shown powerful tagging using fragmentation particles associated with the @xmath3 . however , for the @xmath0 , the flavor information is typically carried by a kaon , and it requires good @xmath60 separation to use same - side taggers for the @xmath0 .",
