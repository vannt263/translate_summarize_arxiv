    "the metric max - cut , max - bisection , min - bisection and other partitioning problems were all proved to have _ polynomial time approximation schemes _  ( ptas )  @xcite .",
    "the above problems are known to be np - hard in exact setting .",
    "the status of those problems for geometric ( thus including euclidean ) metrics and this even for dimension one was widely open .    in this paper we resolve the status of those problems for just dimension one by giving a polynomial time algorithm .",
    "our solution , somewhat surprisingly , involves certain new ideas for applying dynamic programming which could be also of independent interest .",
    "we shall define our dynamic programming method in terms of generalized subproblems on finite multisets of reals generalizing slightly a geometric metric setting .    for a partition of a finite multiset @xmath0 of reals into two multisets @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the _ value of the cut _ is the total length of all intervals on the real line that have one endpoint in @xmath1 and the other one in @xmath3    the max - cut problem for @xmath0 will be now to find a partition of @xmath0 into two multisets that maximizes the value of the cut .",
    "if @xmath4 and the two multisets are additionally required to be of cardinality @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , then we obtain the @xmath7 max - partition problem for @xmath8 in particular , if @xmath9 is even and @xmath10 then we have the max - bisection problem . next , if we replace the requirement of maximization with that of minimization then we obtain the @xmath7 min - partition and min - bisection problems for @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "in this paper we study geometric instances of the above problems in dimension one ( the real line ) which could be rephrased as the problems of partitioning arbitrary finite metric spaces of this dimension .",
    "the global idea behind our algorithm is as follows . we guess how many of the copies of the rightmost real are respectively in the first and second set and move them to the next to the rightmost real .",
    "we also guess how many copies of the reals in the remaining part of the multiset are in the first and second set respectively . having this information",
    ", we can compute exactly the difference between the value of optimal solution for the whole input multiset and that for the multiset resulting from the movement under the guessed partition proportions .",
    "the difference can be easily evaluated due to the triangle equality that holds on the real line .",
    "now , we solve the problem for the transformed multiset whose elements are copies of the shrunk set of reals recursively under the guessed partition proportions , after additionally guessing the proportions of the partition for the original copies of the next to the right real .",
    "eventually , we end up with the trivial multiset where all elements are copies of the leftmost real .",
    "we eliminate guesses by an enumeration of all possibilities and choosing the best one .",
    "next , we solve the resulting subproblems in bottom up fashion instead the top down to obtain a polynomial time solution .",
