    "hii  galaxies ( hiigx ) are massive and compact aggregates of star formation .",
    "the total luminosity of an hiigx is almost completely dominated by the starburst .",
    "giant extragalactic hii  regions ( gehr ) also have massive bursts of star formation , but are generally located in the outer discs of late - type galaxies . in brief , hii  galaxies and the hii  regions of galaxies are characterized by rapidly forming stars surrounded by ionized hydrogen , the presence of which leads to their naming convention .",
    "it is well known that hiigx and gehr are physically similar systems ( melnick et al .",
    "1987 ) ; indeed , their optical spectra are indistinguishable , and are characterized by strong balmer emission lines in @xmath13 and @xmath14 produced by the hydrogen ionized by the young massive star clusters ( searle & sargent 1972 ; bergeron 1977 ; terlevich & melnick 1981 ; kunth & stlin 2000 ) .",
    "since the starburst component can reach very high luminosities , hiigx can be detected at relatively high redshifts ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "what really makes these galaxies interesting as standard candles ( e.g. , melnick et al .",
    "2000 ; siegel et al .",
    "2005 ) is the fact that as the mass of the starburst component increases , both the number of ionizing photons and the turbulent velocity of the gas , which is dominated by gravitational potential of the star and gas , also increase .",
    "this naturally induces a correlation between the luminosity @xmath16 in @xmath14 and the ionized gas velocity dispersion @xmath17 ( terlevich & melnick 1981 ) .",
    "the scatter in this relation is small enough that it can be used as a cosmic distance indicator independently of redshift ( see melnick et al .",

    "( 2012 ) subsequently provided accurate estimates of @xmath18 using the @xmath19 correlation for gehr and local hiigx . the use of intermediate and high-@xmath20 hiigx as deep cosmological tracers was discussed by melnick et al .",

    "like @xmath0cdm , the @xmath1 universe is a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology that assumes the presence of dark energy , as well as matter and radiation .",
    "the principle difference between them is that the latter is also constrained by the equation of state @xmath25 ( the so - called zero active mass condition in general relativity ; melia 2016a , 2016b ) , in terms of the total pressure @xmath26 and energy density @xmath27 .",
    "an examination of which of these two models , @xmath0cdm or @xmath1 , is favoured by the observations has been carried out using a diverse range of data over a period of more than 10 years .",

    "a total sample of 156 sources ( 25 high-@xmath20 hii  galaxies , 107 local hii  galaxies , and 24 giant extragalactic hii  regions ) assembled by terlevich et al .",
    "( 2015 ) are appropriate for this work , and we base our analysis on the methodology described in their paper .    a catalog of 128 local hii  galaxies was selected from the sdss dr7 spectroscopic catalogue ( abazajian et al . 2009 ) for having the strongest balmer emission lines relative to the continuum ( i.e. , the largest equivalent width , @xmath28 , in their @xmath14 emission lines ) and in the redshift range @xmath29 ( chvez et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the lower limit of the equivalent width of @xmath14 was selected to avoid starbursts that are either evolved or contaminated by an underlying older stellar population component ( e.g. , melnick et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the lower redshift limit was set to avoid nearby objects that are more affected by local peculiar motions relative to the hubble flow and the upper limit was chosen to minimize any possible malmquist bias and to avoid gross cosmological effects . from this observed sample , chvez et al .",
    "( 2014 ) removed 13 objects with a low s / n or that showed evidence for a prominent underlying balmer absorption .",
    "they also removed an extra object with highly asymmetric emission lines .",
    "after this cut , 114 objects were left that comprise their ` initial ' sample .",
    "melnick et al . ( 1988 ) showed that imposing an upper limit to the velocity dispersion , such as @xmath30 km @xmath31 , minimizes the probability of including rotationally supported systems and/or objects with multiple young ionizing clusters contributing to the total flux and affecting the line profiles .",
    "therefore , they selected all objects having @xmath30 km @xmath31 from the ` initial ' sample , thus creating their ` benchmark ' catalog comprised of 107 local objects .",
    "following the same sample selection criteria , terlevich et al .",
    "( 2015 ) presented observations of a sample of 6 high-@xmath20 hiigx in the redshift range of @xmath32 obtained with the xshooter spectrograph at the cassegrain focus of the eso - vlt ( european southern observatory very large telescope ) .",

    "( 2014 ) and 12 from masters et al .",
    "( 2014)yields the total set of 25 high-@xmath20 hiigx .",
    "chvez et al .",
    "( 2012 ) first gathered the necessary data from the literature to compile a sample of 24 gehr in nine nearby galaxies . for these objects , the velocity dispersions and the global integrated @xmath14 fluxes with corresponding extinction",
    "were taken from melnick et al .",

    "our sample contains 156 objects , whose properties are summarized in table  1 .",
    ".flux and gas velocity dispersion of hii  galaxies and giant hii  regions . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "hiigx and gehr have been proposed as useful standard candles due to the correlation between their velocity dispersion and the luminosity of their @xmath14 emission line .",
    "given that hiigx can be observed to @xmath21 , they constitute a promising new cosmic tracer which may allow us to obtain better constraints on cosmological parameters than those currently available using tracers at lower redshifts . in this paper , we have added some support to the argument that hiigx and gehr can eventually be used to carry out stringent tests on various cosmological models .",
    "we have confirmed the notion advanced previously that examining the correlation between their velocity dispersion and the @xmath14-line luminosity can indeed produce a luminosity indicator with sufficient reliability to study the expansion of the universe .",
    "we have used the sample of 25 high - redshift hiigx , 107 local hiigx , and 24 gehr to test and compare the standard model @xmath0cdm and the @xmath1 universe .",
    "we have individually optimized the parameters in each model by maximizing the likelihood function . in this regard ,",
    "we emphasize that one should always optimize parameters by carrying out a maximum likelihood estimation in any situation where the error in the observed distance modulus @xmath33 is dependent on the value of one or more free parameters .",
    "it is not correct in such circumstances to simply rely on a @xmath34 minimization . in the flat @xmath0cdm model",
    ", the resulting hubble diagram leads to a best - fit value @xmath35 .",
    "a statistically acceptable fit to the hubble diagram with @xmath5cdm ( the version of @xmath0cdm with a dark - energy equation of state @xmath6 rather than @xmath7 ) is possible only with @xmath8 and @xmath36 .",
    "these values , however , are not fully consistent with the concordance model .    more importantly , we have found that , when the parameter optimization is handled via maximum likelihood optimization , the akaike , kullback and bayes information criteria tend to favor the @xmath1 universe .",
    "since the flat @xmath0cdm model ( with @xmath23 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ) has one more free parameter than @xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , the latter is preferred over the former with a likelihood of @xmath39 versus @xmath40 using aic , @xmath41 versus @xmath42 using kic , and @xmath43 versus @xmath44 using bic .",
    "if we relax the assumption that dark energy is a cosmological constant with @xmath45 , and allow @xmath46 to be a free parameter along with @xmath23 , then the @xmath5cdm model has four free parameters ( i.e. , @xmath23 , @xmath46 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ) .",
    "we find that @xmath1 is preferred over @xmath5cdm with a likelihood of @xmath47 versus @xmath48 using aic , @xmath49 versus @xmath50 using kic , and @xmath51 versus @xmath52 using bic .    in other words ,",
    "the current hiigx sample is sufficient to rule out the standard model in favor of @xmath1 at a very high confidence level .",
    "the consequences of this important result are being explored elsewhere , including the growing possibility that inflation may have been unnecessary to resolve any perceived ` horizon problem ' and therefore may have simply never happened ( melia 2013a ) .",
    "we close this discussion by pointing out three important caveats to our conclusions .",
    "first , since the cosmological parameters are more sensitive to the high-@xmath20 observational data than the low-@xmath20 ones , most of the weight of the constraints obtained in this work ( e.g. , for the parameter of the equation of state of dark energy ) is from the high-@xmath20 sample of only 25 hiigx .",
    "secondly , the systematic uncertainties of the @xmath19 correlation need to be better understood , which may affect hii galaxies as cosmological probes .",
    "the associated systematic uncertainties include the size of the burst , the age of the burst , the oxygen abundance of hii galaxies , and the internal extinction correction ( chvez et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "some progress has already been made with attempts at mitigating these uncertainties ( melnick et al .",
    "1988 ; chvez et al .",
    "2014 ) , though efforts such as these also highlight the need to probe all possible sources of systematic errors more deeply .",
    "for example , an important consideration is the exclusion of rotationally supported systems , which clearly would skew the @xmath53 relation .",
    "melnick et al . ( 1988 ) and chvez et al .",
    "( 2014 , 2016 ) have proposed using an upper limit to the velocity dispersion of @xmath54 km s@xmath55 to minimize this possibility , though at a significant cost  of greatly reducing the catalog of suitable sources .",
    "nonetheless , even with this limit , there is no guarantee that such a systematic effect is completely removed . as a second example , since the @xmath53 relation is essentially a correlation between the ionizing flux produced by the massive stars , and the velocity field in the potential well due to stars and gas , any systematic variation of the initial mass function will affect the mass - luminosity ratio and therefore the slope and/or zero point of the relation ( chvez et al . 2014 ) .",
    "a third important caveat is that our constraints are somewhat weaker than the results of some other cosmological probes , and they have uncertainties because of the small hiigx sample effect . to increase the significance of the constraints",
    ", one needs a larger sample .",
    "fortunately , with the help of current facilities , such as the k - band multi object spectrograph at the very large telescope , a larger sample of high-@xmath20 hiigx with high quality data will be observed in the near future , which will provide much better and competitive constraints on the cosmological parameters ( terlevich et al .",
