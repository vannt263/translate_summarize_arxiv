    "in the last ten years , our observational knowledge of the solar interior has progressed enormously . by means of helioseismic data",
    "it has become possible to derive the sound speed in the solar interior with accuracy of about one part per thousand @xcite . by the same method",
    ", it has been possible to deduce important properties of the convective envelope .",
    "the photospheric helium fraction @xmath5 and depth of the convective envelope @xmath6 have been determined with accuracy of about one per cent and one per thousand respectively , following the pioneering papers by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the neutrino flux from boron decay , obtained by combining sno and super - kamiokande data @xcite , has provided a determination of the temperature @xmath7 near the solar center with accuracy of about one per cent @xcite .",
    "it is impressive that all the predictions of the standard solar model ( ssm ) have been confirmed by these accurate tests , see e.g. @xcite and the first rows of table [ taberror ] for a summary of the available information .",
    "the ssm , like any stellar evolution calculation , depends on several parameters . in this respect",
    "the newton constant @xmath0 plays an important role , since stellar evolution results from the equilibrium between gravitation and other interactions . the sensitivity of stellar evolution to modifications of @xmath0",
    "was first stressed by teller @xcite . by means of a homology argument he demonstrated that the stellar luminosity is @xmath8 ,",
    "so that even a ten per cent variation of @xmath0 from its standard value would imply that life on earth can not be sustained !    among the  fundamental parameters \" of nature @xcite , @xmath0 is the most difficult to measure .",
    "in fact , it is determined with relatively poor accuracy and the situation of the field can be summarized by observing that the codata-98 @xcite value , @xmath9 m@xmath10s@xmath11kg@xmath12 includes a relative accuracy @xmath1 which is a factor ten larger than that estimated in 1986 @xcite .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have claimed accuracy of about @xmath13 however the disagreement between individual results is at the level of @xmath14 .    since several solar properties",
    "are now observationally determined with an accuracy of order @xmath14 , we shall address the following questions :    _ 1 ) what is the uncertainty on ssm predictions induced by the uncertainty of @xmath0 _ ?",
    "_ 2 ) can one exploit the available accurate observations of the solar interior , i.e. helioseismic data and boron neutrino flux , for obtaining a determination of @xmath0 with accuracy comparable or better than that of laboratory measurements ? _",
    "this last question , which is particularly interesting , was recently raised by lopes and silk @xcite .",
    "we shall present solar models calculated for different value of @xmath0 , deriving the predictions to be compared with helioseimic and neutrino data .",
    "we shall find that solar sound speeds and temperature are actually very weakly dependent on @xmath0 and we shall provide an explanation of this apparently puzzling result .",
    "we have built several solar models corresponding to different values of @xmath0 , by using an up - to - date version of the evolutionary code franec , which includes element diffusion , recent opacity tables and modern nuclear reaction rates @xcite .    for a given value of @xmath0 the three input parameters of the code - the mixing length @xmath15 , the initial helium and metal abundances @xmath16 and @xmath17 are varied until one reproduces the observed values of the solar radius [ @xmath18 m ] , luminosity [ @xmath19 w ] and photospheric composition [ @xmath20 at the solar age [ @xmath21 gy ] .",
    "we remark that the calculated properties of the solar interior are sensitive to the values of these observables , particularly to @xmath22 . for this reason , in order to disentangle the effect of tiny changes of @xmath0 we require that @xmath22 is fixed to the level of @xmath23 , i.e. much better than the observational accuracy .",
    "this precaution is necessary , otherwise the calculated models will reflect the changes of @xmath22 mixed to the changes of @xmath0 .",
    "we also remark that astronomical observations fix the product @xmath24 quite accurately @xcite : @xmath25    laboratory measurements of @xmath0 are thus measurements of @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath0 is changed @xmath26 has to be varied so that eq.([eqgm ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this is an important point for the present discusssion .    in figs .",
    "[ figprho],[figu],[figtmu ] and in table [ taberror ] we present the effect of varying @xmath0 by @xmath27 with respect to the  standard \" codata-98 value .",
    "the following points are to be remarked :    \\i ) the changes of pressure and density are of the same order of @xmath28 , as expected , see fig .",
    "[ figprho ] .",
    "\\ii ) on the other hand the induced variation of the ( squared isothermal ) sound speed @xmath29 is much smaller . for @xmath30 one",
    "has at most @xmath31 , a value comparable to the present observational accuracy , see fig .",
    "[ figu ] .",
    "\\iii ) also the variation of temperature is much suppressed , see fig .",
    "[ figtmu ] : the change of the central temperature is about 0.3% , and that of the boron flux is about 5% , see table [ taberror ] , in both cases a factor three below the present observational uncertainty .",
    "\\iv ) the depth of the convective zone is altered just by a factor @xmath32 and the photospheric helium abundance by less than 1% , well below the present observational uncertainties , see again table [ taberror ] .",
    "more generally , we can express the sensitivity of the observable @xmath33 to the change of @xmath0 by using scaling parameters @xmath34 the calculated @xmath35 values are also presented in table [ taberror ] .",
    "changes in @xmath0 at the level of present uncertainty ( @xmath36 ) induce changes of helioseismic observables and neutrino fluxes which are negligible in comparison with the respective observational uncertainty , see last row of table [ taberror ] .",
    "our results do not support the claim of ref .",
    "@xcite that observational solar data can be used to determine the value of @xmath0 with accuracy of few parts in @xmath3 .",
    "variations of @xmath0 at this level induce changes which are much too small in comparison with observational accuracy .",
    "_ in summary , present data are sensitive to changes of @xmath0 provided that these are of the order of @xmath4 . _",
    "a puzzling situation has emerged .",
    "@xmath0 is clearly an important parameter , and its variation induces a comparable change on physically relevant quantities such as @xmath37 and @xmath38 . on the other hand the change of @xmath39 and @xmath40 are definitely suppressed .",
    "the reason for the cancellation is in the constancy of @xmath41 , as can be easily demonstrated .",
    "actually the typical scales of solar pressure and density are given by : @xmath42    for a change of @xmath0 which keeps constant the product of @xmath41 these vary as : @xmath43 in fact , this is the pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ figprho ] .    in this approximation ,",
    "when considering @xmath44 the effects of changing @xmath0 cancel , in other words @xmath39 is unaffected by changes of @xmath0 , which explains the much weaker sensitivity emerging from the numerical calculations presented in the previous sections .    from the perfect gas law , which describes to a good approximation most of the solar core",
    ", one has @xmath45 , so that also @xmath46 is weakly sensitive to changes of @xmath0 .",
    "the present value of the mean molecular weight @xmath47 is mainly determined from the initial conditions ( @xmath16 ) and the solar history and not from @xmath0 .",
    "it follows that also @xmath40 is very weakly sensitive to @xmath0 .",
    "_ we remark that the constancy of @xmath41 is essential for the cancellation . _",
    "if one computes stellar structures with fixed @xmath26 and different @xmath0 one finds fractional changes of @xmath39 and @xmath40 that are proportional to @xmath28 , however these can not be interpreted as solar models .",
    "one expects that , in the future , the sound speed @xmath39 will be measured with a higher accuracy , possibly to the level of @xmath3 . even in this case , however , it will be difficult to get significant improvements on @xmath0 , unless one achieves the same level of accuracy in several other physical inputs which affect @xmath39 .",
    "for instance , let us consider the effect of variations of the nuclear reaction cross sections and of the opacity , @xmath48 , we remind that these quantities are affected by uncertainties of few percent ( at least ) , see @xcite .",
    "as we have already remarked , the product @xmath41 is quite accurately fixed , so that if @xmath0 increases , the solar mass must decrease according to @xmath49 .",
    "a smaller @xmath26 , being the radius of the sun fixed by observational data , implies a reduction of number densities @xmath50 of the various particles present in the sun .",
    "this implies , a reduction of the nuclear reaction rates ( which are proportional to @xmath51 ) and , at the same time , an increase of the photon mean free path ( which , in the core of the sun , is inversely proportional to electron number density ) .",
    "this suggests that suitable changes of nuclear energy production rate @xmath52 and of opacity can mimic changes of @xmath0 .",
    "actually , one expects that a combined variation @xmath53 and @xmath54 should affect the sound speed in the same way as a variation of @xmath0 .",
    "this is supported by the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ figspp ] .",
    "we have built a solar model with energy production rate decreased by 2% and with opacity decreased by 1% , and we have obtained a sound speed profile which is similar ( at the level 0.1% or less ) to that obtained by increasing @xmath0 by 1% .",
    "similar considerations hold for a possible determination of @xmath0 by means of @xmath55 measurements . by using the @xmath56 coefficient shown in tab .",
    "[ taberror ] , one sees that a variation @xmath57 corresponds to change of the @xmath58 neutrino flux @xmath59 a `` global '' accuracy ( i.e. both theorethical and experimental ) of the order @xmath60 is thus needed in order to distinguish among values of @xmath0 which differ by @xmath14 .",
    "we remind that the present experimental and theoretical determinations of the @xmath58 neutrino flux have uncertainties of the order of 15 - 20% per cent.ns hold for a possible determination of @xmath0 by means of @xmath55 measurements . by using the @xmath56 coefficient shown in tab .",

    "we remind that the present experimental and theoretical determinations of the @xmath58 neutrino flux have uncertainties of the order of 15 - 20% per cent .",
    "we have found that :    * the present uncertainty on the gravitational constant , @xmath61 has significant effects on the profile of density and pressure . * on the other hand , it has negligible influence on the solar properties which can be measured by means of helioseismology and @xmath2 neutrinos : sound speed profile , central temperature , depth and helium content of the convective envelope .",
