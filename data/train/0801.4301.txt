    "the g - protein coupled receptor ( gpcr ) superfamily is comprised of an estimated 600 - 1,000 members and is the largest known class of molecular targets with proven therapeutic value .",
    "they are ubiquitous in our body , being involved in regulation of every major mammalian physiological system  @xcite , and play a role in a wide range of disorders including allergies , cardiovascular dysfunction , depression , obesity , cancer , pain , diabetes , and a variety of central nervous system disorders  @xcite .",
    "they are integral membrane proteins sharing a common global topology that consists of seven transmembrane alpha helices , an intracellular c - terminal , an extracellular n - terminal , three intracellular loops and three extracellular loops .",
    "there are four main classes of gpcrs ( a , b , c and d ) depending on their sequence similarity  @xcite .",
    "their location on the cell surface makes them readily accessible to drugs , and @xmath1 gpcrs are the targets for the majority of best - selling drugs , representing about @xmath2 of all prescription pharmaceuticals on the market  @xcite .",
    "besides , the human genome contains several hundred unique gpcrs which have yet to be assigned a clear cellular function , suggesting that they are likely to remain an important target class for new drugs in the future  @xcite .",
    "predicting interactions _ in silico _ between small molecules and gpcrs is not only of particular interest for the drug industry , but also a useful step for the elucidation of many biological process .",
    "first , it may help to decipher the function of so - called _ orphan _ gpcrs , for which no natural ligand is known .",
    "second , once a particular gpcr is selected as a target , it may help in the selection of promising molecule candidates to be screened _ in vitro _ against the target for lead identification .    _ in silico _ virtual screening of gpcrs with classical approaches is however a daunting task for at least two reasons .",
    "first , the 3d structures are currently known for only two gpcrs ( bovine rhodopsin and human @xmath3-adrenergic receptor ) .",
    "indeed , gpcrs , like other membrane proteins , are notoriously difficult to crystallize . as a result ,",
    "docking strategies for screening small molecules against gpcrs are often limited by the difficulty to model correctly the 3d structure of the target . to circumvent the lack of experimental structures ,",
    "various studies have used 3d structural models of gpcrs built by homology modeling using bovine rhodopsin as a template structure . docking a library of molecules into these modeled structures allowed the recovery of known ligands  @xcite , and even identification of new ligands  @xcite .",
    "however , docking methods still suffer from docking and scoring inaccuracies , and homology models are not always reliable - enough to be employed in target - based virtual screening .",
    "methods have been proposed to enhance the quality of the models by global optimization and flexible docking  @xcite , or by using different sets of receptor models .",
    "nevertheless , these methods are expected to show limited performances for gpcrs sharing low sequence similarity with rhodopsin , especially in the case of receptors belonging to classes b , c and d. alternatively , ligand - based strategies , also known as quantitative structure - activity relationship ( qsar ) , attempt to predict new ligands from previously known ligands , often using statistical or machine learning approaches .",
    "ligand - based approaches are interesting because they do not require the knowledge of the target 3d structure and can benefit from the discovery of new ligands . however , their accuracy is fundamentally limited by the amount of known ligands , and degrades when few ligands are known .",
    "although these methods were successfully used to retrieve strong gpcr binders  @xcite , they are efficient for lead optimization within a previously identified molecular scaffold , but are not appropriate to identify new families of ligands for a target . at the extreme",
    ", they can not be pursued for the screening of orphan gpcrs .    instead of focusing on each individual target independently from other proteins ,",
    "a recent trend in the pharmaceutical industry , often referred to as _",
    "chemogenomics _ , is to screen molecules against several targets of the same family simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "this systematic screening of interactions between the chemical space of small molecules and the biological space of protein targets can be thought of as an attempt to fill a large 2d _ interaction matrix _ , where rows correspond to targets , columns to small molecules , and the @xmath4-th entry of the matrix indicates whether the @xmath5-th molecule can bind the @xmath6-th target .",
    "while in general the matrix may contain some description of the strength of the interaction , such as the association constant of the complex , we will focus in this paper on a simplified description that only differentiates binding from non - binding molecules , which results in a binary matrix of target - molecule pairs .",
    "this matrix is already sparsely filled with our current knowledge of protein - ligand interactions , and chemogenomics attempts to fill the holes .",
    "while classical docking or ligand - based virtual screening strategies focus on each single row independently from the others in this matrix , i.e. , treat each target independently from each others , the chemogenomics approach is motivated by the observation that similar molecules can bind similar proteins , and that information about a known interaction between a ligand and a gpcr could therefore be a useful hint to predict interaction between similar molecules and similar gpcrs",
    ". this can be of particular interest when , for example , a particular target has few or no known ligands , but similar proteins have many : in that case it is tempting to use the information about the known ligands of similar proteins for a ligand - based virtual screening of the target of interest . in this context , we can formally define _ in silico _ chemogenomics as the problem of predicting interactions between a molecule and a ligand ( i.e. , a hole in the matrix ) from the knowledge of all other known interactions or non - interactions ( i.e. , the known entries of the matrix ) .",
    "recent reviews  @xcite describe several strategies for _ in silico _ chemogenomics . a first class of approaches , called _ ligand - based chemogenomics _",
    "by @xcite , pool together targets at the level of families ( such as gpcr ) or subfamilies ( such as purinergic gpcr ) and learn a model for ligands at the level of the family @xcite .",
    "other approaches , termed _",
    "target - based chemogenomic _",
    "approaches by @xcite , cluster receptors based on ligand binding site similarity and again pool together known ligands for each cluster to infer shared ligands @xcite . finally , a third strategy termed _ target - ligand _",
    "approach by @xcite attempts to predict ligands for a given target by leveraging binding information for other targets in a single step , that is , without first attempting to define a particular set of similar receptors .",
    "this strategy was pioneered by @xcite to predict ligands of orphan gpcr .",
    "they merged descriptors of ligands and targets to describe putative ligand - receptor complexes , and used svm to discriminate real complexes from ligand - receptors pairs that do not form complexes .",
    "@xcite followed a similar idea with different descriptors , and showed in particular that the svm formulation allows to generalize the use of vectors of descriptors to the use of positive definite kernels to describe the chemical and the biological space in a computationally efficient framework .",
    "@xcite were not able to show , however , significant benefits with respect to the individual approach that learns a separate classifier for each gpcr ( except in the case of orphan gpcrs , for which their approach performed better than the baseline random classifier ) .",
    "recently , in the context of predicting interactions between peptides and different alleles of mhc - i molecules , @xcite followed a similar approach and highlighted the importance of choosing adequate descriptors for small molecules and targets .",
    "they obtained state - of - the - art prediction accuracy for most mhc - i allele , in particular for those with few known binding peptides .    in this paper",
    "we go one step further in this direction and present an _ in silico _",
    "chemogenomics approach specifically tailored for the screening of gpcrs , although the method could in principle be adapted to other classes of therapeutic targets .",
    "we follow the idea of @xcite and the algorithmic trick of @xcite , which allows us to systematically test a variety of descriptors for both the molecules and the gpcrs .",
    "we test two families of 2d and 3d descriptors to describe molecules , including a new 3d kernel , and six ways to describe gpcrs , including a description of their relative positions in current hierarchical classifications of the superfamily , and information about key residues likely to be in contact with the ligand .",
    "we test the approach on the data of the glida database  @xcite , which contains @xmath7 reported interactions between human gpcrs and small molecules , and observe that the choice of the descriptors has a significant impact on the accuracy of the models .",
    "in particular , the best results are reached when using the description of gpcrs within the hierarchical classification of the superfamily , combined with a set of 2d descriptors of small molecules .",
    "this allows us to obtain dramatic improvements of the prediction accuracy with respect to the individual learning setting .",
    "in an experiment where we simulate the prediction of ligands for orphan gpcrs , we obtain accuracies of @xmath0 , significantly above the @xmath8 baseline accuracy of a random predictor .",
    "in this section , we first review the methods proposed by @xcite for _ in silico _ chemogenomics with svm , before presenting the particular descriptors we propose to use for molecules and gpcrs within this framework .",
    "we consider the problem of predicting interactions between gpcrs and small molecules .",
    "for this purpose we assume that a list of target / small molecule pairs @xmath9 , known to interact or not , is given .",
    "such information is often available as a result of systematic screening campaigns in the pharmaceutical industry , or on dedicated databases .",
    "our goal is then to create a model to predict , for any new candidate pair @xmath10 , whether the small molecule @xmath11 is likely to bind the gpcr @xmath12 .    a general method to create the predictive model is to follow these four steps :    1 .",
    "choose @xmath13 descriptors to represent each gpcr target @xmath12 in the biological space by a @xmath13-dimensional vector @xmath14 ; 2 .   in parallel , choose @xmath15 descriptors to represent each molecule @xmath11 in the chemical space by a @xmath15-dimensional vector @xmath16 ; 3 .   derive a vector representation of a candidate target / molecule complex @xmath17 from the representations of the target @xmath18 and of the molecule @xmath19 ; 4 .   use a statistical or machine learning method to train a classifier able to discriminate between binding and non - binding pairs , using the training set of binding and",
    "non - binding pairs @xmath20    while the first two steps ( selection of descriptors ) may be specific to each particular chemogenomics problem , the last two steps define the particular strategy used for _ in silico _ chemogenomics . for example",
    ", @xcite proposed to concatenate the vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 to obtain a @xmath21-dimensional vector representation of the ligand - target complex @xmath17 , and to use a svm as a machine learning engine .",
    "@xcite followed a slightly different strategy for the third step , by forming descriptors for the pair @xmath10 as _ product _ of small molecule and target descriptors .",
    "more precisely , given a molecule @xmath11 described by a vector @xmath19 and a gpcr @xmath12 described by a vector @xmath18 , the pair @xmath10 is represented by the tensor product : @xmath22 that is , a @xmath23-dimensional vector whose entries are products of the form @xmath24 , for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "a svm is then used as an inference engine , to estimate a linear function @xmath27 in the vector space of target / molecule pairs , that takes positive values for interacting pairs and negative values for non - interacting ones .",
    "the main motivation for using the tensor product is that it provides a systematic way to encode correlations between small molecule and target features .",
    "for example , in the case of binary descriptors , the product of two features is @xmath28 if both the molecule and the target descriptors are @xmath28 , and zero otherwise , which amounts to encode the simultaneous presence of particular features of the molecule and of the target that may be important for the formation of a complex . a potential issue with this approach , however , is that the size of the vector representation @xmath29 for a pair may be prohibitively large for practical computation and manipulation .",
    "for example , using a vector of molecular descriptors of size @xmath30 for molecules , and representing a protein by the vector of counts of all @xmath31-mers of amino - acids in its sequence ( @xmath32 ) results in more than 400k dimensions for the representation of a pair .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , this computational obstacle can however be overcome when a svm is used to train the linear classifier , thanks to a trick often referred to as the _ kernel trick_. indeed , a svm does not necessarily need the explicit computation of the vectors representing the complexes in the training set to train a model .",
    "what it needs , instead , is the inner products between these vectors , and a classical property of tensor products is that the inner product between two tensor products @xmath17 and @xmath33 is the product of the inner product between @xmath18 and @xmath34 , on the one hand , and the inner product between @xmath19 and @xmath35 , on the other hand .",
    "more formally , this property can be written as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the inner product between two @xmath38-dimensional vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "in other words , the svm does not need to compute the @xmath29 vectors to describe each pair , it only computes the respective inner products in the target and ligand spaces , before taking the product of both numbers .    this flexibility to manipulate molecule and target descriptors separately",
    "can moreover be combined with other tricks that sometimes allow to compute efficiently the inner products in the target and ligand spaces , respectively .",
    "many such inner products , also called _ kernels _ , have been developed recently both in computational biology  @xcite and chemistry  @xcite , and can be easily combined within the chemogenomics framework as follows : if two kernels for molecules and targets are given as : @xmath41 then we obtain the inner product between tensor products , i.e. , the kernel between pairs , by : @xmath42    in summary , as soon as two vectors of descriptors or kernels @xmath43 and @xmath44 are chosen , we can solve the _ in silico _ chemogenomics problem with an svm using the product kernel between pairs .",
    "the particular descriptors or kernels used should ideally encode properties related to the ability of similar molecules to bind similar targets or ligands respectively .    in the next two subsections , we present different possible choices of descriptors  or kernels  for small molecules and gpcrs , respectively .",
    "the problem of explicitly representing and storing small molecules as finite - dimensional vectors has a long history in chemoinformatics , and a multitude of molecular descriptors have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "these descriptors include in particular physicochemical properties of the molecules , such as its solubility or logp , descriptors derived from the 2d structure of the molecule , such as fragment counts or structural fingerprints , or descriptors extracted from the 3d structure  @xcite .",
    "each classical fingerprint vector and vector representation of molecules define an explicit `` chemical space '' in which each molecule is represented by a finite - dimensional vector , and these vector representations can obviously be used as such to define kernels between molecules  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , some authors have recently proposed some kernels that generalize some of these sets of descriptors and correspond to inner products between large- or even infinite - dimensional vectors of descriptors .",
    "these descriptors encode , for example , the counts of an infinite number of walks on the graph describing the 2d structure of the molecules @xcite , or various features extracted from the 3d structures @xcite .    in this study",
    "we select two existing kernels , encoding respectively 2d and 3d structural information of the small molecules , and propose a new 3d kernel :    * _ the 2d tanimoto kernel_. our first set of descriptors is meant to characterize the 2d structure of the molecules . for a small molecule @xmath11 , we define the vector @xmath19 as the binary vector whose bits indicate the presence or absence of all linear graph of length @xmath39 or less as subgraphs of the 2d structure of @xmath45 .",
    "we chose @xmath46 in our experiment , i.e. , characterize the molecules by the occurrences of linear subgraphs of length @xmath47 or less , a value previously observed to give good results in several virtual screening tasks  @xcite .",
    "moreover , instead of directly taking the inner product between vectors as in , we use the tanimoto kernel : @xmath48 which was proven to be a valid inner product by  @xcite , giving very competitive results on a variety of qsar or toxicity prediction experiments . * _",
    "3d pharmacophore kernel _",
    "while 2d structures are known to be very competitive in ligand - based virtual screening @xcite , we reasoned that some specific 3d conformations of a few atoms or functional groups may be responsible for the interaction with the target .",
    "thus , we decided to test descriptors representing the presence of potential 3-point pharmacophores .",
    "for this , we used the 3d pharmacophore kernel proposed by  @xcite , that generalizes 3d pharmacophore fingerprint descriptors .",
    "this approach implies the choice of a 3d conformer for each molecule . in absence of sufficient data available for bound ligands in gpcr structures",
    ", we chose to build a 3d version of the ligand base in which molecules are represented in an estimated minimum energy conformation .",
    "for each of the @xmath49 retained ligands , @xmath50 conformers were generated with the omega program ( openeye scientific software ) using standard parameters , except for a @xmath51 rmsd clustering of the conformers , instead of the @xmath52 default value .",
    "a 3d ligand base was generated by keeping the conformer of lowest energy for each ligand .",
    "partial charges were calculated for all atoms using the molcharge program ( openeye scientific software ) with standard parameters .",
    "this ligand base was then used to calculate a 3d pharmacophore kernel for molecules  @xcite .",
    "we used the freely and publicly available _ _ chemcpp _ _ software to compute the 2d and 3d pharmacophore kernel .",
    "svm and kernel methods are also widely used in bioinformatics  @xcite , and a variety of approaches have been proposed to design kernels between proteins , ranging from kernels based on the amino - acid sequence of a protein  @xcite to kernels based on the 3d structures of proteins  @xcite or on the pattern of occurrences of proteins in multiple sequenced genomes  @xcite .",
    "these kernels have been used in conjunction with svm or other kernel methods for various tasks related to structural or functional classification of proteins .",
    "while any of these kernels can theoretically be used as a gpcr kernel in  , we investigate in this paper a restricted list of specific kernels described below , aimed at illustrating the flexibility of our framework and test various hypothesis .",
    "* the _ dirac _ kernel between two targets @xmath53 is : @xmath54 this basic kernel simply represents different targets as orthonormal vectors . from ( [ eq : product ] )",
    "we see that orthogonality between two proteins @xmath12 and @xmath55 implies orthogonality between all pairs @xmath56 and @xmath57 for any two small molecules @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this means that a linear classifier for pairs @xmath56 with this kernel decomposes as a set of independent linear classifiers for interactions between molecules and each target protein , which are trained without sharing any information of known ligands between different targets . in other words , using dirac kernel for proteins amounts to performing classical learning independently for each target , which is our baseline approach .",
    "* the _ multitask _ kernel between two targets @xmath53 is defined as : @xmath60 this kernel , originally proposed in the context of multitask learning @xcite , removes the orthogonality of different proteins to allow sharing of information . as explained in @xcite , plugging @xmath61 in amounts to decomposing the linear function used to predict interactions as a sum of a linear function common to all gpcrs and of a linear function specific to each gpcr : @xmath62 a consequence",
    "is that only data related to the the target @xmath12 are used to estimate the specific vector @xmath63 , while all data are used to estimate the common vector @xmath64 . in our framework",
    "this classifier is therefore the combination of a target - specific part accounting for target - specific properties of the ligands and a global part accounting for general properties of the ligands across the targets .",
    "the latter term allows to share information during the learning process , while the former ensures that specificities of the ligands for each target are not lost .",
    "* the _ hierarchy _ kernel .",
    "alternatively we could propose a new kernel aimed at encoding the similarity of proteins with respect to the ligands they bind . in the glida database indeed , gpcrs are grouped into @xmath65 classes based on sequence homology and functional similarity : the _ rhodopsin _ family ( class a ) , the _ secretin _ family ( class b ) , the _ metabotropic _ family ( class c ) and some smaller classes containing other gpcrs . the glida database further subdivides each class of targets by type of ligands , for example amine or peptide receptors or more specific families of ligands .",
    "this also defines a natural hierarchy that can be used to compare gpcrs .",
    "+ the hierarchy kernel between two gpcrs was therefore defined as the number of common ancestors in the corresponding hierarchy plus one , that is , @xmath66 where @xmath67 contains as many features as there are nodes in the hierarchy , each being set to @xmath28 if the corresponding node is part of @xmath12 s hierarchy and @xmath68 otherwise , plus one feature constantly set to one that accounts for the `` plus one '' term of the kernel . * the _ binding pocket _ kernel .",
    "because the protein - ligand recognition process occurs in 3d space in a pocket involving a limited number of residues , we tried to describe the gpcr space using a representation of this pocket .",
    "the difficulty resides in the fact that although the gpcr sequences are known , the residues forming this pocket and its precise geometry are _ a priori _ unknown",
    ". however , the two available x - ray structures , together with mutagenesis data showed that the binding pockets are situated in a similar region for all gpcrs  @xcite . in order to identify residues",
    "potentially involved in the binding pocket of gpcrs of unknown structure studied in this work , we proceeded in several steps .",
    "( a ) the two known structures ( pdb entries 1u19 and 2rh1 ) were superimposed using the stamp algorithm  @xcite . in the superimposed structures , the retinal and 3-(isopropylamino)propan- 2-ol ligands are very close , which is in agreement with global conservation of binding pockets , as shown on figure  [ fig : pocket ] .",
    "( b ) the structural alignment of bovine rhodopsin and of human @xmath3-adrenergic receptor was used to generate a sequence alignment of these two proteins .",
    "( c ) for both structures , in order to identify residues potentially involved in stabilizing interactions with the ligand ( residues of the pocket ) , we selected residues that presented at least one atom situated at less than @xmath69 from at least one atom of the ligand",
    ". figure  [ fig : ligand ] shows that these two pockets clearly overlap , as expected .",
    "( d ) residues of the two pockets ( as defined in ( c ) ) were labeled in this structural sequence alignment .",
    "these residues were found to form small sequence clusters that were in correspondence in this alignment .",
    "these clusters were situated mainly in the apical region of transmembrane segments and included a few extracellular residues .",
    "( e ) all studied gpcr sequences , including bovine rhodopsin and of human @xmath3-adrenergic receptor were aligned using clustalw  @xcite with blosum matrices  @xcite . for each protein ,",
    "residues in correspondence with a residue of the binding pocket ( as defined above ) of either bovine rhodopsin or human @xmath3-adrenergic receptor were retained .",
    "this lead to a different number of residues per protein , because of sequence variability . for example , in extracellular regions , some residues from bovine rhodopsin or human @xmath3-adrenergic receptor had a corresponding residue in some sequences but not in others . in order to provide a homogeneous description of all gpcrs , in the list of residues initially retained for each protein",
    ", only residues situated at positions conserved in almost all gpcrs were kept .",
    "( f ) each protein was then represented by a vector whose elements corresponded to a potential conserved pocket . this description , although appearing as a linear vector filled with amino acid residues , implicitly codes for a 3d information on the receptor pocket , as illustrated on figure  [ fig : ligand ] .",
    "these vectors were then used to build a kernel that allows comparison of binding pockets . the classical way to represent motifs of constant length as fixed length vectors is to encode the letter at each position by a @xmath70-dimensional binary vector indicating which amino acid is present , resulting in a @xmath71-dimensional vector representations . in terms of kernel , the inner product between two binding pocket motifs in this representation is simply the number of letters they have in common at the same positions : @xmath72,x'[i]),\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the length of the binding pocket motifs ( @xmath73 in our case ) , @xmath74 $ ] is the @xmath6-th residue in x and @xmath75,x'[i])$ ] is @xmath28 if @xmath74 = x'[i]$ ] , @xmath68 otherwise .",
    "this is the baseline pocket binding kernel . alternatively , using a polynomial kernel of degree @xmath76 over the baseline kernel is equivalent , in terms of feature space , to encoding @xmath76-order interactions between amino acids at different positions . in order to assess the relevance of such non - linear extensions we tested this polynomial pocket binding kernel , @xmath77 we only used a degree @xmath78 , although a more careful choice of this parameter could further improve the performances . *",
    "the _ binding pocket hierarchy _ kernel .",
    "because of the link between binding pockets and ligand recognition , we also defined a new hierarchy based on the sequence alignment of the binding pocket amino acid vectors without gaps . to do this",
    ", we used a pam matrix with high values of gap insertion and extension to compare each couple of gpcr vectors .",
    "the obtained scores were used in upgma ( unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean ) to determine a binding pocket similarity based hierarchy .",

    "we used the glida gpcr - ligand database  @xcite which includes @xmath80 known ligands for and @xmath81 gpcrs from human , rat and mouse .",
    "the ligand base contains highly diverse molecules , from ions and very small molecules up to peptides . in order to eliminate unwanted molecules such as inorganic compounds and molecules with unsuitable molecular weights , we filtered the glida ligand base using the filter program ( openeye scientific software ) with standard parameters .",
    "the most important filtering feature here was to keep molecules of molecular weights ranging from @xmath82 da to @xmath83 da .",
    "overall , the glida ligand base was filtered in order to retain molecules that had the physico- chemical characteristics of drugs .",
    "this filter retained @xmath84 molecules . because the glida ligand base contains a few duplicates , we eliminated these redundancies , which lead to @xmath49 different molecules , available under a 2d description files and giving @xmath85 interactions with the human gpcrs .",
    "elimination of duplicates present in the glida base was important here because it could have lead to overfitting in the learning step . for each positive interaction given by this restricted set",
    ", we generated a negative interaction involving the same receptor and one of the ligands that was in the database and was not indicated as one of its ligands .",
    "this probably generated some false negative points in our benchmark , and it would be interesting to use experimentally tested negative interactions .",
    "we loaded the sequences of all gpcrs that are able to bind any of these ligands , which lead to 80 sequences , all corresponding to human gpcrs . in the glida database ,",
    "gpcrs are classified in a hierarchy ( as mentioned above ) which was also loaded for use in the hierarchy kernel .",
    "we ran two different sets of experiments on this dataset in order to illustrate two important points . in a first set of experiments , for each gpcr , we 5-folded the data available , i.e. the line of the interaction matrix corresponding to this gpcr .",
    "the classifier was trained with four folds and the whole data from the other gpcrs , _",
    "i.e. _ , all other lines of the interaction matrix .",
    "the prediction accuracy for the gpcr under study was then tested on the remaining fold .",
    "the goal of these first experiments was to evaluate if using data from other gpcrs improved the prediction accuracy for a given gpcr . in a second set of experiments , for each gpcr we trained a classifier on the whole data from the other gpcrs , and tested on the data of the considered gpcr .",
    "the goal was to assess how efficient our chemogenomics approach would be to predict the ligands of orphan gpcrs . in both experiments ,",
    "the @xmath86 parameter of the svm was selected by internal cross validation on the training set among @xmath87 .",
    "for the first experiment , since learning an svm with only one training point does not really make sense and can lead to `` anti - learning '' less than @xmath88 performances , we set all results @xmath89 involving the dirac gpcr kernel on gpcrs with only @xmath28 known ligand to @xmath90 .",
    "this is to avoid any artefactual penalization of the dirac approach and make sure we measure the actual improvement brought by sharing information across gpcrs .",
    ".prediction accuracy for the first experiment with various ligand and target kernels .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we showed how sharing information across the gpcrs by considering a chemogenomics space of the gpcr - ligand interaction pairs could improve the prediction performances .",
    "in addition , we showed that using such a representation , it was possible to make reasonable predictions even when no ligand was known for a given gpcr , that is , to predict ligands for orphan gpcrs . our approach is simply to apply well known machine learning methods in the constructed chemogenomics space .",
    "we used a systematic way to build such a space by combining a given representation of the ligands with a given representation of the gpcrs into a binding - prediction - oriented gpcr - ligand couple representation .",
    "this allows to use any ligand or gpcr descriptor or kernel existing in the chemoinformatics or bioinformatics literature , or new ones containing other prior information as we tried to propose in this paper .",
    "our experiments showed that the choice of the descriptors was crucial for the prediction , and more sophisticated features for either the ligands or the gpcrs could probably further improve the performances .    in all experiments , 3d pharmacophore kernels",
    "did not reach the performance of 2d kernels for the ligands .",
    "this is apparently in contradiction we the idea that protein - ligand interaction is a process occurring in the 3d space , and that introduction of 3d information should increase the performance .",
    "different explanations can be proposed .",
    "the choice of the low energy conformer was guided by the following idea .",
    "because only two ligand conformations bound to gpcr receptors are available , it was not possible to derive any general information that could be used to choose a potential bioactive 3d conformer for each molecule of the ligand base . in this context , the only possible reasonable assumption was that , while interaction with the receptor will certainly perturb the conformational energy surface of a flexible ligand , high affinity would be observed for ligands that bind in a conformation that is not exceptionally different from a local free state energy minimum  @xcite .",
    "although there exists a large number of methods for exploring the conformation space of a molecule , we used the omega program that performs rapid systematic conformer search , because it has been showed to present good performances for retrieving bioactive conformations  @xcite .",
    "however , the set of parameters used to run omega in this study ( because of calculation time limitations ) may not have allowed to reach a local energy minimum : generating a larger number of conformers , with a smaller rmsd clustering value may have helped to find better energy minima , and this could be further evaluated . moreover , some studies report that the bioactive conformation of a molecule can differ from the minimum energy conformation , and that significant strain energies can indeed be found for molecules in complex with proteins  @xcite .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that this is the case for gpcr ligands . in the future ,",
    "resolution of additional 3d structures in this family will help to clarify this point .",
    "one possible improvement of the method could be to use homology models for the gpcrs , dock the ligand base in the modeled binding pockets , and build a 3d ligand base using , for each molecule , the conformer associated to the best docking solution . in other families of proteins , enzymes for example , where many structures are available and can be used to define bioactive conformers , the 3d pharmacophore kernel is expected to improve performance , as observed in a previous pure ligand - based study involving ligands in a given series , for which the bioactive conformation can be inferred from a known 3d structure  @xcite .    various evidence suggest that , within a common global architecture , a generic binding pocket mainly involving transmembrane regions hosts agonists , antagonists and allosteric modulators . in order to identify this pocket automatically , other studies report the use of sequence alignment and the prediction of transmembrane helices .",
    "@xcite detected hypervariable positions in transmembrane helices for identification of residues forming the binding pocket .",
    "the underlying idea was that conserved residues were probably important for structure stabilization , while variable positions were involved in ligand binding , in order to accommodate the wide spectrum of molecules that are gpcr substrates . using this method , they proposed potential binding pockets for gpcrs , and found that the corresponding residues were frequently in the grap mutant database for gpcrs  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these authors pointed that residues corresponding to these hypervariable positions were found within a distance of @xmath91 from retinal in the rhodopsin x - ray structure .",
    "therefore , although we used a different method to automatically extract binding pocket residues in the gpcr families , our results are in good agreement with this study .",
    "interesting developments of this method could include application to quantitative prediction of the binding affinities , that would be straightforward using regression algorithms in the same chemogenomics space .",
    "another possibility is application to other important drug target families , like enzymes or ion channels  @xcite , for which most of the descriptors used for the gpcrs in this paper could directly be used , and other , more specific ones could be designed . from a methodological point of view , many recent developments in multitask learning  @xcite could be applied to generalize this chemogenomics approach using , for example , other regularization methods .",

    "<S> the g - protein coupled receptor ( gpcr ) superfamily is currently the largest class of therapeutic targets . _ in silico _ prediction of interactions between gpcrs and small molecules is therefore a crucial step in the drug discovery process , which remains a daunting task due to the difficulty to characterize the 3d structure of most gpcrs , and to the limited amount of known ligands for some members of the superfamily . </S>",
    "<S> chemogenomics , which attempts to characterize interactions between all members of a target class and all small molecules simultaneously , has recently been proposed as an interesting alternative to traditional docking or ligand - based virtual screening strategies .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose new methods for _ in silico _ chemogenomics and validate them on the virtual screening of gpcrs . </S>",
    "<S> the methods represent an extension of a recently proposed machine learning strategy , based on support vector machines ( svm ) , which provides a flexible framework to incorporate various information sources on the biological space of targets and on the chemical space of small molecules . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the use of 2d and 3d descriptors for small molecules , and test a variety of descriptors for gpcrs . </S>",
    "<S> we show fo instance that incorporating information about the known hierarchical classification of the target family and about key residues in their inferred binding pockets significantly improves the prediction accuracy of our model . </S>",
