    "confinement effects play an important role in the thermodynamics of several materials such as polymers , liquid crystals , and magnets .",
    "for example , capillary condensation stands as a well known example of how phase equilibrium is affected by the confluence of surface and finite - size effects .",
    "in particular , due to the wall - particle interaction , a fluid between two plates undergoes a gas - liquid transition at a lower pressure than it does in the bulk .",
    "these effects of confinement are due to the additional contributions to the thermodynamic potential of the solvation force ( finite - size effect ) and the wall - fluid interfacial tension ( surface effect).@xcite    a more complicated physical situation arises in the case of thin films of polymer mixtures on selective substrates.@xcite an @xmath4 polymer mixture which undergoes a phase separation below a bulk critical temperature @xmath5 , develops , when cast into a thin film over a substrate , an interface between the two phases which runs parallel to the substrate .",
    "this interface appears provided there is a substrate affinity for one of the components  the confinement is established between the polymer - air and polymer - substrate boundaries .",
    "a model fluid confined between two parallel walls that exert opposite surface fields , has been often considered in order to investigate the underlying physics in systems with competing boundaries . in this case , the interplay between wetting and phase separation is very important , unlike the case of capillary condensation in which wetting plays a small role .",
    "the competition between surface effects leads to an interesting and unusual behavior :  phase coexistence is restricted to temperatures below the wetting temperature @xmath6 even in the limit of infinite separation between the plates .",
    "the wetting temperature depends on the surface field and it can be far from the bulk critical temperature.@xcite the aforementioned scenario , first predicted using a mean - field approximation , has been confirmed subsequently via monte carlo simulations and transfer - matrix calculations in two dimensions.@xcite however , when the effect of gravity is considered phase coexistence is restored up to the bulk critical temperature.@xcite    the confinement studies described above deal with phase separating systems , in which the phases coexisting along a line of first - order transitions have the same symmetry , e.g. , ferromagnetic thin films .",
    "surface effects in systems with ordering ( antiferromagnetic ) interactions have been investigated mostly within the context of binary alloys undergoing a first - order phase transition , with particular emphasis on the surface - induced order and surface - induced disorder phenomena,@xcite although some investigations have been done in the context of multilayer adsorption .",

    "the effective pair interactions , the surface field , and the external magnetic field ( @xmath2 ) shall be expressed in terms of the bulk afm coupling ( @xmath36 ) . the ratio of surface to bulk coupling is then denoted by  @xmath0 .",

    "we arrived at the set of gs in table [ t1 ] as follows .",

    ", the surfaces are under the influence of a `` missing neighbors '' field @xmath61 that arises from the disruption of the translational symmetry perpendicular to the surfaces .",
    "this missing neighbors field produces an inhomogeneous magnetization profile .",
    "thus , with increasing external field , the surfaces may turn into a ferromagnetic state before the bulk does .",
    "application of a surface field @xmath62 can restore the magnetization profile to the homogeneous condition . note that the missing neighbors field depends on @xmath0 ,",

    "a direct comparison between the energies @xmath65 for each structure @xmath32 gives the ground state for every set of values of the thermodynamic variables ( see table [ t1 ] ) .",
    "however , it is more useful and less tedious to consider a physical sequence of gs structures ( as a function of the applied field ) and examine its domain of stability as we vary the surface variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    as a starting point , consider the following case :  upon the application of an external field @xmath2 ( in either direction ) , a film with @xmath66 and @xmath67 will pass from an afm state in all layers ( small @xmath68 ) to a state with ferromagnetic surfaces and an afm bulk and , finally , for large @xmath68 , to a ferromagnetic state in all planes .",

    "thus , ground - state structures 4 and 6 are due the confinement effects .",
    "when either gs 4 or gs 6 become unstable in favor of gs 5 , surface effects are lost and the film is subject only to the finite - size effects .    an external surface field will produce an asymmetry in the gs sequence since the hamiltonian is not invariant under the transformation @xmath73 , @xmath74 . applying a surface field @xmath38",
