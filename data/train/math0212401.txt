    "this can be done in two ways .",

    "thus we have a complex simple lie algebra @xmath6 corresponding to @xmath0 .",
    "since vertices of the dynkin diagram correspond to simple coroots of @xmath6 , the above bijection gives an isomorphism ( of vector spaces ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the complex cartan subalgebra of @xmath6 .",
    "this correspondence @xmath16 is based on the classification of simple lie algebras since they attach a dynkin diagram to @xmath0 .",
    "so the reason why such a result holds remained misterious .",

    "@xmath41 is a resolution of singularities of @xmath49 ( fogarty ) .",
    "2 .   @xmath41 has a holomorphic symplectic structure ( beauville , mukai ) .",
    "in fact , the author constructed a hyper - khler structure on @xmath41 , which induces beauville - mukai s symplectic form , by describing it as a hyper - khler quotient .",

    "let @xmath115 be the inverse image @xmath116 in @xmath117 .",
    "the most important one is the central fiber , i.e. , the fiber over @xmath118 in this case , we use the special notation @xmath119 .",
    "it is known that this is a lagrangian subvariety of @xmath101 .",
    "suppose that @xmath120 is contained in the stratum @xmath121 .",

    "the proof of this statement in @xcite , @xcite was given only when @xmath126 and explained in terms of quivers , so we give more direct argument in our situation . the fiber @xmath115 parametrises @xmath0-invariant subsheaves @xmath74 of @xmath127 such that @xmath128 = { { \\mathbf v}}$ ] and @xmath129 .",

    "the punctural hilbert schemes are known to be irreducible , thus @xmath115 is pure - dimensional if and only if @xmath143 is so .",
    "but the latter statement is known @xcite .",
    "-5 mm    after writing @xcite , the author tried to use this generalized adhm description to study these varieties @xmath101 .",
    "but it turned out to be not so easy as he had originally hoped .",
    "when he struggled the problem , he heard a talk by lusztig in icm 90 kyoto on a construction of canonical bases by using quivers .",
    "lusztig s construction @xcite was motivated by ringel s construction @xcite of the upper half part of the quantized enveloping algebra via the hall algebra .",
    "the author thought that this construction should be useful to attack the problem .",
    "two years later , he began to understand the picture .",
    "quiver varieties @xmath101 are , very _ roughly _ , cotangent bundles of varieties used by ringel and lusztig , and similar construction is possible @xcite .",
    "a little later , he graduately realized that quiver varieties are also similar to cotangent bundles of flag varieties and the map @xmath9 is an analog of springer resolution .",
    "these varieties had been used to give geometric constructions of weyl groups ( springer representations ) and affine hecke algebras ( deligne - langlands conjecture ) .",
    "( see a beautifully written text book by n.  chriss and v.  ginzburg @xcite and the references therein for these matereial . )",
    "the technique is the convolution product ( see below ) and works quite general .",
    "so he ( and some others ) conjectured that these construction should be adapted to quiver varieties .",
    "this conjecture turned out to be true @xcite .",
    "we explain the constructions in this and next sections .",
    "the relation between our constructions and ringel - lusztig construction was explained in @xcite and will not be reproduced here .",
