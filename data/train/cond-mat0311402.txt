    "et al._@xcite , @xmath37 in zero field decreases with decreasing temperature , and it exhibits a slight enhancement below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath12 , defined as the onset temperature of the meissner diamagnetism . by the application of magnetic fields ,",
    "@xmath37 is suppressed at low temperatures .",
    "strictly looking , it appears that the temperature @xmath6 , below which @xmath37 is suppressed , is located above @xmath12 and is almost independent of the magnitude of the magnetic field .",
    "the suppression by the application of magnetic fields is marked in @xmath4 0.10 and 0.13 , while it is small in @xmath4 0.115 . by the application of magnetic fields parallel to the @xmath0-plane ,",
    "on the other hand , the suppression is so small in all @xmath38 that @xmath6 is hard to be determined , as shown in figs .",

    "it is clearly seen that the relative reduction in a field parallel to the @xmath5-axis exhibits a dip at @xmath4 0.115 at low temperatures below @xmath6 , while that in the field parallel to the @xmath0-plane is almost independent of @xmath38 in the whole temperature range .",
    "the former @xmath38 dependence with a dip - like shape is similar to the dip - like shape around @xmath17 1/8 in the @xmath12 vs @xmath38 diagram , being associated with the 1/8 anomaly and the stripe order .",
    "first , we try explaining the observed field - dependence of @xmath37 in terms of conventional mechanisms .",
    "it is well known that the thermal conductivity in the high-@xmath12 cuprates exhibits an increase just below @xmath12 with decreasing temperature , which is explained as being due to the increase of the thermal conductivity due to both phonons and electrons on account of the decrease of the phonon - electron scattering rate and the increase of the life time of quasiparticles , respectively@xcite . by the application of magnetic fields , the thermal conductivity due to quasiparticles",
    "is expected to be enhanced in such d - wave superconductors as the high-@xmath12 cuprates owing to the volovik effect@xcite , namely , the increase of the density of states at the fermi level , because the supercurrent surrounding vortices causes the doppler shift of the energy of quasiparticles around the nodes of the superconducting gap@xcite . in detail , recent theories have suggested two kinds of pictures for the state of quasiparticles in magnetic fields .",
    "one is a group of discrete states induced by the andreev reflection which are composed of localized states within vortex cores@xcite and quantized states expanding outside vortex cores@xcite .",
    "the other is an energy - band state due to the periodic vortex potential@xcite . in any case , however , these are contrary to the present experimental result . in order to understand the suppression of the thermal conductivity due to quasiparticles in magnetic fields",
    ", we should consider that the increase of quasiparticles leads to the increase of the electron - electron scattering rate and/or the increase of the electron - vortex scattering rate .",
    "the latter has been proposed to understand the field dependence of the in - plane thermal conductivity in bi@xmath10sr@xmath10cacu@xmath10o@xmath40@xcite . as for the thermal conductivity due to phonons ,",
    "on the other hand , it is expected to be suppressed by the application of magnetic fields owing to the increase of the phonon - vortex scattering rate and/or the increase of the phonon - electron scattering rate , because the number of quasiparticles increases due to the doppler shift .",
    "hence , at a glance , the suppression of the thermal conductivity does not seem anomalous at all .",
    "however , these conventional mechanisms can not explain the fairly small field - dependence of @xmath37 in @xmath4 0.115 compared with @xmath37 in @xmath4 0.10 and 0.13 .",
    "therefore , a new concept is necessary to explain the suppression of the thermal conductivity by the application of magnetic fields in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 .",
    "next , in order to explain the anomalous @xmath38 dependence of the suppression of the thermal conductivity in magnetic fields , we focus our mind on the development of the static stripe order in magnetic fields . in the following discussion , the field - induced magnetic order is regarded as the field - induced static stripe order .",
    "for comparison with the neutron scattering data , the temperature dependence of the relative reduction of the thermal conductivity , @xmath41/\\kappa_{\\rm ab}({\\rm 0 t})$ ] , in several magnetic fields @xmath42 parallel to the @xmath5-axis is plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig:3](a)-(c ) . for @xmath4 0.10",
    ", it is found that the relative reduction rapidly increases at low temperatures below @xmath6 with decreasing temperature and that @xmath6 is almost independent of the magnitude of the magnetic field .",
    "the relative reduction is found to increase with increasing magnetic - field .",
    "these temperature and field dependences are quite similar to those of the intensity of the magnetic bragg peak corresponding to the static stripe order in magnetic fields in @xmath4 0.10@xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath6 of @xmath4 0.10 coincides with the temperature @xmath43 of @xmath4 0.10 below which the magnetic bragg peak in magnetic fields develops@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is naturally understood that the suppression of the thermal conductivity in magnetic fields is related to the development of the static stripe order .        as mentioned in sec .",
    "i , there are some previous reports on the relation between the thermal conductivity due to phonons and the static stripe order .",
    "it has been reported that the thermal conductivity due to phonons is enhanced by the formation of the static stripe order for la@xmath25nd@xmath26sr@xmath15cuo@xmath3@xcite and la@xmath1sr@xmath2nio@xmath3@xcite and that , on the contrary , it is suppressed in the possible short - range ( dynamical ) stripe - ordered state of yba@xmath10cu@xmath22o@xmath27 and hgba@xmath10ca@xmath28cu@xmath29o@xmath30 ( @xmath44 1 , 2 , 3 ) around @xmath45@xcite .",
    "the enhancement of the thermal conductivity due to phonons in la@xmath25nd@xmath26sr@xmath15cuo@xmath3 has been interpreted as being due to the disappearance of the scattering of phonons by the dynamical stripes which make the mean free path of phonons strongly limited@xcite . in this case , phonons are expected not to be scattered so strongly by the lattice distortion induced by the static stripe order in la@xmath25nd@xmath26sr@xmath15cuo@xmath3 , because the correlation length of the static stripe order is more than @xmath46 so that the lattice distortion is regarded as being rather periodic@xcite . in the case of yba@xmath10cu@xmath22o@xmath27 , on the other hand , the suppression of the thermal conductivity due to phonons has been interpreted as being due to the possible formation of the short - range stripe order , namely , the dynamical stripe correlations , which was suggested from the inelastic neutron scattering experiment in yba@xmath10cu@xmath22o@xmath47 by mook _ et al._@xcite .",
    "accordingly , it is found to depend on the correlation length of the stripe order whether the thermal conductivity is enhanced or suppressed , but the present suppression of the thermal conductivity in magnetic fields in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 can not be explained on these lines , because the correlation length of the static stripe order of @xmath4 0.10 in a magnetic field of 14.5 t@xcite is as long as that of la@xmath13nd@xmath14sr@xmath15cuo@xmath3 in zero field@xcite . according to the detailed investigation on the effect of the structural phase transition on the thermal conductivity for la@xmath48nd@xmath49sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 by sera _",
    "et al._@xcite , on the other hand , the enhancement of the thermal conductivity is explained as being due to the increase of the phonon velocity through the structural phase transition to the tlt structure .",
    "very recently , moreover , it has been pointed out by hess _",
    "et al._@xcite that the enhancement in the tlt phase of la@xmath48re@xmath49sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( re : rare earth element ) is probably not due to the formation of the static stripe order but due to the suppression of the lattice instability . at present",
    ", therefore , it appears that the formation of the static stripe order does not have a large effect on the thermal conductivity due to phonons and it is hard to clearly explain the present suppression of the thermal conductivity in magnetic fields on the basis of the thermal conductivity due to phonons .",
    "alternatively , we try to understand the suppression of the thermal conductivity on the basis of the change of the thermal conductivity due to quasiparticles through the field - induced static stripe order . in the cuo@xmath10 plane where the static stripe order is formed ,",
    "charge carriers ( holes ) are confined in the one - dimensional path of the stripe@xcite , so that they can not move so easily as in the carrier - homogeneous cuo@xmath10 plane , leading to the decrease of the mobility of quasiparticles carrying heat .",
    "in fact , it has been pointed out from the electrical resistivity@xcite and thermal conductivity@xcite measurements that quasiparticles tend to be localized by the application of magnetic fields in the underdoped region of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 . moreover , when both the static stripe - ordered phase and the superconducting phase coexist and form domains , the mean free path of quasiparticles carrying heat is expected to be reduced by the domain wall .",
    "accordingly , the suppression of the thermal conductivity in magnetic fields in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 is able to be ascribed to the decrease of the thermal conductivity due to quasiparticles through the development of the static stripe order , and its anomalous @xmath38 dependence is also explained as follows .",
    "that is to say , the small field dependence in @xmath4 0.115 is attributed to the fact that the static stripe order is already developed in @xmath4 0.115 even in zero field@xcite , while the large field dependence in @xmath4 0.10 and 0.13 is able to be regarded as being due to the marked development of the static stripe order by the application of magnetic fields .",
    "as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:3](a)-(c ) , in fact , the field dependence of the relative reduction of the thermal conductivity is very small in @xmath4 0.115 , compared with the large field - dependence in @xmath4 0.10 and 0.13 . here",
    ", it is noted that the temperature dependence of the relative reduction of the thermal conductivity in @xmath4 0.115 and 0.13 roughly indicate the temperature dependence of the intensity of the magnetic bragg peak corresponding to the static stripe order in magnetic fields , as in the case of @xmath4 0.10 .",
    "furthermore , it is worth while noting that figs .",
    "[ fig:3](a)-(c ) perhaps represent the development of the charge stripe order in @xmath4 0.10 , 0.115 and 0.13 . by the way",
    ", this model gives a possible answer for the well - known question why the enhancement of the thermal conductivity at low temperatures below @xmath12 is relatively small in la@xmath50sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3@xcite compared with the other high-@xmath12 cuprates@xcite . in the underdoped region , this is because at least a small amount of the static stripe order exists even in zero field to strongly suppress the thermal conductivity , though the magnetic bragg peak detected in the neutron scattering experiments is very weak@xcite .",
    "the above model is confirmed by the following experimental result for the 1 % zn - substituted la@xmath1sr@xmath2cu@xmath7zn@xmath8o@xmath3 with @xmath4 0.115 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "it is found that the thermal conductivity exhibits no field - dependence in magnetic fields parallel to the @xmath5-axis and also parallel to the @xmath0-plane .",
    "according to the above model , no field - dependence is reasonably understood , because the static stripe order is fully developed even in zero field on account of the strong pinning effect of zn@xcite so that further development of the static stripe order by the application of magnetic fields is not expected .",
    ", of the 1 % zn - substituted la@xmath1sr@xmath2cu@xmath7zn@xmath8o@xmath3 ( @xmath4 0.115 ) in magnetic fields ( a ) parallel to the @xmath5-axis and ( b ) parallel to the @xmath0-plane .",
    "arrows denote the superconducting temperature @xmath12 . ]    now , there remains a question why @xmath6 is almost independent of the magnitude of the magnetic field , though this question has already been pointed out from the neutron scattering experiment@xcite . before answering the question",
    ", first we suppose the stripe pinning model by vortex cores . taking into account the result that the dynamical stripes of spins and holes are pinned in such an inhomogeneous electronic background as the partially zn - substituted cuo@xmath10 plane@xcite , vortex cores induced in the cuo@xmath10 plane are also expected to operate to pin the dynamical stripes , as mentioned in sec .",
    "i. surely , the existence of impurities such as zn atoms or vortex cores induces the energy loss in the dynamical stripes , but the most important point is that the energy loss depends on whether an impurity such as zn or a vortex core is located at a charge stripe or a spin stripe .",
    "the stripe order should be located in a way which make the energy loss the smallest , so that the dynamical stripes are pinned , resulting in the development of the static stripe order .",
    "the stripe pinning model by vortex cores is supported by the present experimental result that the suppression of the thermal conductivity is not observed by the application of magnetic fields parallel to the @xmath0-plane .",
    "this is because , in magnetic fields parallel to the @xmath0-plane , vortex cores penetrate the so - called blocking - layer preferably , so that no vortex core appears in the cuo@xmath10 plane , leading to neither pinning of the dynamical stripes nor development of the static stripe order . recurring to the question , the distance between vortex cores is @xmath11 130 @xmath51 in a magnetic field of 14 t. therefore , the pinning effect of vortex cores seems to be so local that @xmath6 does not depend on the number of vortex cores at least in magnetic fields up to 14 t. meanwhile , it is found that @xmath6 is located above @xmath12 , but this is not inconsistent with the above discussion , because the superconducting fluctuation exists above @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , recent reports on the nernst effect have suggested that the vortex state survives even above @xmath12@xcite .",
    "thus , the field independence of @xmath6 is explained in terms of the stripe pinning model by vortex cores@xcite .",
    "of the temperature @xmath6 below which the in - plane thermal conductivity is suppressed by the application of magnetic fields parallel to the @xmath5-axis , the superconducting transition temperature @xmath12 , the temperature @xmath52 below which the development of the dynamical spin correlation was detected in zero field from the @xmath19sr measurements@xcite and the temperatures @xmath43(0)@xcite and @xmath43(14.5 t)@xcite below which the magnetic bragg peak corresponding to the static stripe order develops in the neutron scattering measurements in zero field and in a magnetic field of 14.5 t parallel to the @xmath5-axis , respectively .",
    "solid lines are guides for eyes . ]    finally , in order to examine the stripe pinning model by vortex cores , we compare the present results with the neutron scattering results@xcite and also the recent @xmath19sr results revealing a peculiar @xmath38 dependence of the temperature @xmath52 below which the development of the dynamical spin correlations was detected in zero field from the @xmath19sr measurements@xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] shows @xmath38 dependences of @xmath6 , @xmath12 , @xmath52 , @xmath43(0 ) in zero field and @xmath43(14.5 t ) in a magnetic field of 14.5 t parallel to the @xmath5-axis .",
    "it is found that both @xmath43(0 ) and @xmath52 exhibit the maximum at @xmath53 0.115 , while @xmath6 exhibits the minimum at @xmath4 0.115 .",
    "that is , the @xmath38 dependences of @xmath43(0 ) and @xmath52 are contrary to that of @xmath6 , so that @xmath6 is directly correlated with @xmath12 rather than @xmath43(0 ) and @xmath52 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath6 is regarded as the temperature below which vortex cores are formed in the superconducting fluctuation region in the cuo@xmath10 plane so as to pin the dynamical stripes and develop the static stripe order .",
    "in fact , the observed field dependence of the thermal conductivity is well explained as follows . for @xmath4 0.115 , @xmath6 is lower than @xmath43(0 ) , so that further development of the static stripe order is not large at low temperatures below @xmath6 , leading to the fairly small field - dependence of the thermal conductivity . for @xmath4 0.10 and 0.13 , on the other hand , @xmath6 is much higher than @xmath43(0 ) , so that the development of the static stripe order is marked at low temperatures below @xmath6 , leading to the large field - dependence of the thermal conductivity .",
    "the result that @xmath6 is much higher than @xmath43(0 ) for @xmath4 0.10 and 0.13 is analogous to the result obtained from the @xmath19sr measurements that the long - range magnetic ordering temperature @xmath54 is much higher in the lightly zn - substituted la@xmath1sr@xmath2cu@xmath55zn@xmath49o@xmath3 than in the zn - free la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 for @xmath4 0.10 and 0.13@xcite , suggesting that vortex cores operate to pin the dynamical stripes as zn atoms .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that @xmath43(14.5 t ) deviates from @xmath43(0 ) and roughly coincides with @xmath6 .",
    "accordingly , the present results strongly suggest that the origin of the field - induced magnetic order is the pinning of the dynamical stripes by vortex cores .",
    "we have measured the thermal conductivity in the @xmath0-plane of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( @xmath4 0.10 , 0.115 , 0.13 ) in magnetic fields up to 14 t parallel to the @xmath5-axis and also parallel to the @xmath0-plane . by the application of magnetic fields parallel to the @xmath5-axis , the thermal conductivity has been found to be suppressed at low temperatures below the temperature @xmath6 which is located above @xmath12 and almost independent of the magnitude of the magnetic field .",
    "the suppression is marked in @xmath4 0.10 and 0.13 , while it is small in @xmath4 0.115 .",
    "furthermore , no suppression is observed in the 1 % zn - substituted la@xmath1sr@xmath2cu@xmath7zn@xmath8o@xmath3 with @xmath4 0.115 .",
    "taking into account the experimental results that the temperature dependence of the relative reduction of the thermal conductivity in @xmath4 0.10 is quite similar to the temperature dependence of the intensity of the magnetic bragg peak corresponding to the static stripe order in magnetic fields and that the zn substitution tends to stabilize the static order , it is concluded that the suppression of the thermal conductivity in magnetic fields is attributed to the development of the static stripe order .",
    "the temperature dependence of the relative reduction of the thermal conductivity in @xmath4 0.115 and 0.13 may indicate the temperature dependence of the intensity of the magnetic bragg peak corresponding to the static stripe order in magnetic fields , as in the case of @xmath4 0.10 .",

    "<S> we have measured the thermal conductivity in the @xmath0-plane of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( @xmath4 0.10 , 0.115 , 0.13 ) in magnetic fields up to 14 t parallel to the @xmath5-axis and also parallel to the @xmath0-plane . by the application of magnetic fields parallel to the @xmath5-axis , the thermal conductivity has been found to be suppressed at low temperatures below the temperature @xmath6 which is located above the superconducting transition temperature and is almost independent of the magnitude of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression is marked in @xmath4 0.10 and 0.13 , while it is small in @xmath4 0.115 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , no suppression is observed in the 1 % zn - substituted la@xmath1sr@xmath2cu@xmath7zn@xmath8o@xmath3 with @xmath4 0.115 . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the experimental results that the temperature dependence of the relative reduction of the thermal conductivity is quite similar to the temperature dependence of the intensity of the incommensurate magnetic bragg peak corresponding to the static stripe order and that the zn substitution tends to stabilize the static order , it is concluded that the suppression of the thermal conductivity in magnetic fields is attributed to the development of the static stripe order . </S>",
    "<S> the present results suggest that the field - induced magnetic order in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 originates from the pinning of the dynamical stripes of spins and holes by vortex cores . </S>"
