    "the stellarator concept has an advantage over the pulsed tokamak . on the other hand",
    "the neoclassical transport exhibited by the former at low collisionality in the absence of electric fields , in the so - called @xmath3 regime , is considerably larger .",
    "the reason for this unfavourable behaviour is that in contrast to the axisymmetric case , where the collisionless trajectories of the trapped particle are confined , the orbits of particles trapped in the helical magnetic wells are generally not confined .",
    "this situation leads to a different radial transport rate for each species in the plasma and necessitates a radial electric field @xmath4 that restores ambipolarity . here",

    "is the toroidal flux and @xmath8 the toroidal flux at the last closed magnetic surface .",
    "this label can be written in terms of the effective radius @xmath9 as @xmath10 with @xmath11 the minor radius of the plasma . in the present context",
    "the basic ordering parameter , @xmath12 , is the larmor radius @xmath13 normalized to a typical macroscopic variation length scale @xmath14 .",
    "consequently the distribution function is expressible up to first order as @xmath15 , with @xmath16 . in standard conditions",
    "points inwards ( ion root regime ) and predicts accumulation of impurities @xcite .",
    "the subsequent increase of radiative losses from the core can cause the collapse of the plasma @xcite , and , in the worst case , endanger the capability of the stellarator to confine it in steady - state . +",
    "a quantitative and comprehensive description of the impurity dynamics requires not only the ambipolar radial electric field but also the electrostatic potential @xmath17 determined by @xmath2 .",
    "this portion of the total electrostatic potential @xmath18 , whose explicit solution has been obtained in the past @xcite and pointed out to have a modest impact on the transport of the bulk species @xcite has been traditionally neglected .",
    "this rests on two assumptions .",
    "first , the radial @xmath0 drift arising from @xmath1 ,    @xmath19    is assumed to be smaller than the curvature and _ grad - b _ drifts . in the vacuum approximation",
    "these are given by ,    @xmath20    with @xmath21 the mass of the particle , @xmath22 its electric charge , @xmath23 is the charge number , @xmath24 is the unit charge absolute value , @xmath25 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath26 is a unitary vector pointing in the direction of the magnetic field line , @xmath27 is the magnetic moment , @xmath28 is the parallel velocity and @xmath29 is the perpendicular one .",
    "it can be shown that the ratio between the absolute values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is thus of order    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the major radius of the device , and it is assumed that the typical variation length scales for @xmath25 and @xmath1 are similar to @xmath33 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "this ratio can be acceptably small at low values of @xmath23 , but is usually considerable for heavy impurities .",
    "+ second , the parallel acceleration @xmath34 is assumed to be negligible compared to the mirror force @xmath35 .",
    "the ratio between these two is of order ,    @xmath36    with @xmath37 the typical amplitude of the helical magnetic wells .",
    "again , the proportionality to @xmath23 makes it necessary to account for @xmath38 if the impurity transport is to be quantitatively , although @xmath1 can be sufficiently small for the bulk species .",
    "+ on the other hand , the inclusion of @xmath1 into the problem makes the kinetic energy of the impurities vary enough to violate the traditional neoclassical mono - energetic assumption that the velocity is nearly constant along the collisionless particle orbits . + in the present work we put the focus on the computation of the neoclassical particle flux of impurities including @xmath1 , thus abandoning the mono - energetic assumption , but keeping the radially local one .",
    "this latter approximation assumes that the drifts across the flux surface are sufficiently small to treat them perturbatively .",
    "the calculations are performed with the monte carlo @xmath2 pic code ` euterpe ` .",
    "a concise description of it is given in section [ sec : euterpe ] , highlighting the truncation of the global characteristics to perform local neoclassical runs .",

    "in light of these results it is of immediate interest to extend the calculations to account for the toroidal dependence of @xmath1 .",
    "apart from the role that this can play , it is important to remember that the ripple average also reduces the number of possible configurations that can be studied .",
