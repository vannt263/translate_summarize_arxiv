    "such energy harvesting capabilities will make sustainable and environmentally friendly deployment of wireless communication networks possible .",
    "while energy - efficient scheduling policies have been well - investigated in traditional battery powered ( un - rechargeable ) systems @xcite , energy - efficient scheduling in energy harvesting networks with nodes that have rechargeable batteries has only recently been considered @xcite .",
    "references @xcite consider a single - user communication system with an energy harvesting transmitter , and develop a packet scheduling scheme that minimizes the time by which all of the packets are delivered to the receiver .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a multi - user extension of the work in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider a wireless broadcast channel with an energy harvesting transmitter . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bc ] , we consider a broadcast channel with one transmitter and two receivers , where the transmitter node has three queues .",
    "the data queues store the data arrivals intended for the individual receivers , while the energy queue stores the energy harvested from the environment .",
    "our objective is to adaptively change the transmission rates that go to both users according to the instantaneous data and energy queue sizes , such that the total _ transmission completion time _ is minimized .    in this paper , we focus on finding the optimum _ off - line _ schedule , by assuming that the energy arrival profile at the transmitter is known ahead of time in an off - line manner , i.e. , the energy harvesting times and the corresponding harvested energy amounts are known at time @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that there are a total of @xmath1 bits that need to be delivered to receiver 1 , and @xmath2 bits that need to be delivered to receiver 2 , available at the transmitter at time @xmath0 . as shown in fig .",

    "our goal is to develop a method of transmission to minimize the time , @xmath6 , by which all of the data packets are delivered to their respective receivers .",
    "the optimal packet scheduling problem in a single - user energy harvesting communication system is investigated in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we prove that the optimal scheduling policy has a `` majorization '' structure , in that , the transmit power is kept constant between energy harvests , the sequence of transmit powers increases monotonically , and only changes at some of the energy harvesting instances ; when the transmit power changes , the energy constraint is tight , i.e. , at the times when the transmit power changes , the total consumed energy equals the total harvested energy . in @xcite , we develop an algorithm to obtain the optimal off - line scheduling policy based on these properties .",
    "reference @xcite extends @xcite to the case where rechargeable batteries have finite sizes .",
    "we extend @xcite in @xcite to a fading channel .    references @xcite investigate two related problems .",
    "the first problem is to maximize the throughput ( number of bits transmitted ) with a given deadline constraint , and the second problem is to minimize the transmission completion time with a given number of bits to transmit .",
    "these two problems are `` dual '' to each other in the sense that , with a given energy arrival profile , if the maximum number of bits that can be sent by a deadline is @xmath7 in the first problem , then the minimum time to transmit @xmath7 bits in the second problem must be the deadline in the first problem , and the optimal transmission policies for these two problems must be identical . in this paper",
    ", we will follow this `` dual problems '' approach .",
    "we will first attack and solve the first problem to determine the structural properties of the optimal solution .",
    "we will then utilize these structural properties to develop an iterative algorithm for the second problem .",
    "our iterative approach has the goal of reducing the two - user broadcast problem into a single - user problem as much as possible , and utilizing the single - user solution in @xcite .",
    "the second problem is also considered in the independent work @xcite which uses convex optimization techniques to reduce the problem into local sub - problems that consider only two energy arrival epochs at a time .",
    "we first analyze the structural properties of the optimal policy for the first problem where our goal is to maximize the number of bits delivered to both users under a given deadline constraint . to that end , we first determine the _ maximum departure region _ with a given deadline constraint @xmath6 .",
    "the maximum departure region is defined as the set of all @xmath8 that can be transmitted to users reliably with a given deadline @xmath6 . in order to do that",
    ", we consider the problem of maximizing @xmath9 under the energy causality constraints for the transmitter , for all @xmath10 . varying @xmath11 , @xmath12 traces the boundary of the maximum departure region .",
    "we prove that the optimal _ total _ transmit power policy is independent of the values of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and it has the same `` majorization '' structure as the single - user non - fading solution . as for the way of splitting the total transmit power between the two users , we prove that there exists a _ cut - off _ power level for the stronger user , i.e. , only the power above this _ cut - off _ power level is allocated to the weaker user .",
    "we then consider the second problem , where our goal is to minimize the time , @xmath6 , by which a given @xmath13 number of bits are delivered to their intended receivers .",
    "as discussed , since the second problem is `` dual '' to the first problem , the optimal transmission policy in this problem has the same structural properties as in the first problem .",
    "therefore , in the second problem as well , there exists a _ cut - off _ power level .",
    "the problem then becomes that of finding an optimal _ cut - off _ power such that the transmission times for both users become identical and minimized . with these optimal structural properties , we develop an iterative algorithm that finds the optimal schedule efficiently .",
    "in particular , we first use the fact that the optimum total transmit power has the same structural properties as the single - user problem , to obtain the first optimal total power , @xmath14 , i.e. , the optimal total power in the first epoch .",
    "then , given the fact that there exists a _ cut - off _ power level , @xmath15 , for the stronger user , the optimal transmit strategy depends on whether @xmath14 is smaller or larger than @xmath15 , which , at this point , is unknown .",
    "therefore , we have two cases to consider .",
    "if @xmath15 is smaller than @xmath14 , then the stronger user will always have a constant , @xmath15 , portion of the total transmit power .",
    "this reduces the problem to a single - user problem for the second user , together with a fixed - point equation in a single variable ( @xmath15 ) to be solved to ensure that the transmissions to both users end at the same time . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath15 is larger than @xmath14 , this means that all of @xmath14 must be spent to transmit to the first ( stronger ) user . in this case",
    ", the number of bits delivered to the first user in this time duration can be subtracted from the total number of bits to be delivered to the first user , and the problem can be started anew with the updated number of bits @xmath16 after the first epoch .",
    "therefore , in both cases , the broadcast channel problem is essentially reduced to single - user problems , and the approach in @xcite is utilized recursively to solve the overall problem .",
    "the system model is as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : bc ] and  [ fig : bc_system ] .",
    "the transmitter has an energy queue and two data queues ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bc ] ) .",
    "the physical layer is modeled as an awgn broadcast channel , where the received signals at the first and second receivers are @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the transmit signal , and @xmath19 is a gaussian noise with zero - mean and unit - variance , and @xmath20 is a gaussian noise with zero - mean and variance @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the second user is the _ degraded _ ( weaker ) user in our broadcast channel . assuming that the transmitter transmits with power @xmath23 , the capacity region for this two - user awgn broadcast channel is @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fraction of the total power spent for the message transmitted to the first user .",
    "let us denote @xmath26 for future use .",
    "then , the capacity region is @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "this capacity region is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bc_capacity ] .    working on the boundary of the capacity region",
    ", we have @xmath29 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bc ] , the transmitter has @xmath1 bits to transmit to the first user , and @xmath2 bits to transmit to the second user .",
    "energy is harvested at times @xmath5 with amounts @xmath4 .",
    "our goal is to select a transmission policy that minimizes the time , @xmath6 , by which all of the bits are delivered to their intended receivers .",
    "the transmitter adapts its transmit power and the portions of the total transmit power used to transmit signals to the two users according to the available energy level and the remaining number of bits .",
    "the energy consumed must satisfy the causality constraints , i.e. , at any given time @xmath30 , the total amount of energy consumed up to time @xmath30 must be less than or equal to the total amount of energy harvested up to time @xmath30 .    before we proceed to give a formal definition of the optimization problem and propose the solution ,",
    "we start with the `` dual '' problem of this transmission completion time minimization problem , i.e. , instead of trying to find the minimal @xmath6 , we aim to identify the maximum number of bits the transmitter can deliver to both users by any fixed time @xmath6 . as we will observe in the next section , solving the `` dual '' problem enables us to identify the optimal structural properties for both problems , and these properties eventually help us reduce the original problem into simple scenarios , which can be solved efficiently .",
    "in this section , our goal is to characterize the maximum departure region for a given deadline @xmath6 . we define it as follows .    for any fixed transmission duration",
    "@xmath6 , the maximum departure region , denoted as @xmath31 , is the union of @xmath8 under any feasible rate allocation policy over the duration @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 , subject to the energy constraint @xmath35 , for @xmath36 .",
    "we call any policy which achieves the boundary of @xmath31 to be optimal . in the single - user scenario in @xcite",
    ", we first examined the structural properties of the optimal policy .",
    "based on these properties , we developed an algorithm to find the optimal scheduling policy . in this broadcast scenario also , we will first analyze the structural properties of the optimal policy , and then obtain the optimal solution based on these structural properties .",
    "the following lemma which was proved for a single - user problem in @xcite was also proved for the broadcast problem in @xcite .",
    "[ lemma : const ] under the optimal policy , the transmission rate remains constant between energy harvests , i.e. , the rate only potentially changes at an energy harvesting epoch .",
    "we prove this using the strict convexity of @xmath37 .",
    "if the transmission rate for any user changes between two energy harvesting epochs , then , we can always equalize the transmission rate over that duration without contradicting with the energy constraints . based on the convexity of @xmath37 , after equalization of rates , the energy consumed over that duration decreases , and",
    "the saved energy can be allocated to both users to increase the departures .",
    "therefore , changing rates between energy harvests is sub - optimal .",
    "therefore , in the following , we only consider policies where the rates are constant between any two consecutive energy arrivals .",
    "we denote the rates that go to both users as @xmath38 over the duration @xmath39 . with this property , an illustration of the maximum departure region",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectory ] .",
    "@xmath31 is a convex region .",
    "proving the convexity of @xmath31 is equivalent to proving that , given any two achievable points @xmath13 and @xmath40 in @xmath31 , any point on the line between these two points is also achievable , i.e. , in @xmath31 .",
    "assume that @xmath13 and @xmath40 can be achieved with rate allocation policies @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",

    "any point on the line between @xmath13 and @xmath40 can be achieved . when @xmath48 , the inequality in ( [ eqn : g ] ) is strict .",
    "therefore , we save some amount of energy under the new policy , which can be used to increase the throughput for both users .",
    "this implies that @xmath31 is strictly convex .    in order to simplify the notation , in this section , for any given @xmath6",

    "[ fig : bc_energy_rate ] .",

    "the problem in ( [ prob1 ] ) is a convex optimization problem with a convex cost function and a convex constraint set , therefore , the unique global solution should satisfy the extended kkt conditions .",

    "if @xmath78 , we can always let the weaker user transmit with some power over this duration without contradicting with any energy constraints .",
    "since there is no interference from the stronger user , the departure from the weaker user can be improved , thus it contradicts with the optimality of the policy .",

    "otherwise , @xmath91 , and ( [ g2 ] ) implies @xmath92 which contradicts with ( [ g1 ] ) .",

    "in particular , @xmath15 is the unique solution of @xmath160 note that @xmath161 is a continuous , strictly monotonically decreasing function of @xmath15 , hence the solution for @xmath15 in ( [ eq ] ) is unique .",
    "since @xmath128 is a decreasing function of @xmath15 and @xmath161 is a decreasing function of @xmath15 , we can use the bisection method to solve ( [ eq ] ) . in this case , the minimum transmission completion time is @xmath162 .    if @xmath155 is larger than @xmath2 , that implies @xmath163 , and we need to increase the power allocated for the first user to make @xmath128 and @xmath129 equal , i.e. , @xmath164 . therefore , from lemma  [ lemma : cutoff ] , over the duration @xmath165 , the optimal policy is to allocate the entire @xmath14 to the first user only .",
    "we allocate @xmath14 to the first user , calculate the number of bits departed for the first user , and remove them from @xmath1 .",
    "this simply reduces the problem to that of transmitting @xmath166 bits starting at time @xmath167 , where @xmath168 .",
    "the process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : search_pc ] .",
    "then , the minimum transmission completion time is @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the number of recursions needed to get @xmath15 .    in both scenarios ,",
    "we reduce the problem into a simple form , and obtain the final optimal policy . before we proceed to prove the optimality of the algorithm",
    ", we introduce the following lemma first , which is useful in the proof of the optimality of the algorithm .",
    "[ lemma : mono ]",
    "@xmath171 monotonically increases in @xmath6 ; @xmath172 monotonically increases in @xmath6 also .",
    "the monotonicity of both functions can be verified by taking derivatives , @xmath173 and @xmath174 where the inequality follows since @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , @xmath171 is a strictly concave function , and its first derivative monotonically decreases when @xmath6 increases .",
    "since when @xmath176 , when @xmath177 , we have @xmath178 , therefore , the monotonicity follows .    similarly , we have @xmath179 and @xmath180 again , the concavity implies that the first derivative is positive when @xmath177 , and the monotonicity follows .",
    "the algorithm is feasible and optimal .",
    "we first prove the optimality . in order to prove that the algorithm is optimal",
    ", we need to prove that @xmath14 is optimal .",
    "once we prove the optimality of @xmath14 , the optimality of @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 follows .",
    "since the solution obtained using our algorithm always has the optimal structure described in lemma  [ lemma : cutoff ] , the optimality of the power allocation also implies the optimality of the rate selection , thus , the optimality of the algorithm follows .",
    "therefore , in the following , we prove that @xmath14 is optimal .",
    "first , we note that @xmath14 is the minimal slope up to @xmath148 .",
    "we need to prove that @xmath14 is also the minimal slope up to the final transmission completion time , @xmath6 .",
    "let us define @xmath184 as follows @xmath185 assume that with @xmath147 , we allocate @xmath186 to the first user , and finish @xmath13 using constant rates",
    ". then , we allocate @xmath187 to the first user , and the rest to the second user .",
    "based on lemma  [ lemma : mono ] , we have @xmath188 therefore , @xmath184 is an upper bound for the optimal transmission completion time . since @xmath14 is the minimal slope up to @xmath184 ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath14 is optimal throughout the transmission . following similar arguments",
    ", we can prove the optimality of the rest of the power allocations .",
    "this completes the proof of optimality .    in order to prove that the allocation is feasible , we need to show that the power allocation for the first user is always feasible in each step . therefore , in the following",
    ", we first prove that @xmath14 is feasible when we assume that @xmath151 .",
    "the feasibility of @xmath14 also implies the feasibility of the rest of the power allocation . with the assumption that @xmath151 , the final transmission time for the first user is @xmath189 based on ( [ eqn : b1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : b2 ] ) , we know that @xmath190 .",
    "since @xmath14 is feasible up to @xmath184 , therefore , @xmath14 is feasible when we assume that @xmath151 .",
    "the feasibility of the rest of the power allocations follows in a similar way .",
    "this completes the feasibility part of the proof .",
    "we consider a band - limited awgn broadcast channel , with bandwidth @xmath191 mhz and the noise power spectral density @xmath192 w / hz . we assume that the path loss between the transmitter and the first receiver is about @xmath193 db , and the path loss between the transmitter and the second user is about @xmath194 db .",
    "then , we have @xmath195 therefore , @xmath196 for the energy harvesting process , we assume that at times @xmath197 $ ] s , we have energy harvested with amounts @xmath198 $ ] mj . we find the maximum departure region @xmath31 for @xmath199 s , and plot them in fig .  [ fig : bc_region ] .",
    "we observe that the maximum departure region is convex for each value of @xmath6 , and as @xmath6 increases , the maximum departure region monotonically expands .",
    "then , we aim to minimize the transmission completion time with @xmath200 mbits . following our algorithm",
    ", we obtain the optimal transmission policy , which is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : bc_example1 ] .",
    "we note that the powers change only potentially at instances when energy arrives ( lemma  [ lemma : const ] ) ; power sequence is monotonically increasing and `` majorized '' over the whole transmission duration ( lemma  [ lemma4 ] ) .",
    "we also note that , for this case , the first user transmits at a constant rate , and the rate for the second user monotonically increases .",
    "the transmitter finishes its transmissions to both users by time @xmath201 s , and the last energy harvest at time @xmath202 s is not used .",
    "next , we consider the example when @xmath203 mbits , we have the optimal transmission policy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bc_example2 ] . in this example , the cut - off power is greater than @xmath14 , and therefore , @xmath14 is allocated to the first user only over @xmath204 s , and after @xmath205 s , the first user keeps transmitting at a constant rate until all bits are transmitted . in this case , the transmission rates for both users monotonically increase .",
