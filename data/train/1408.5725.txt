    "random tensor models ( see @xcite for a recent review ) generalize in dimension three ( and higher ) the celebrated matrix models ( see , for example , @xcite for a review ) . indeed , in the same way matrix models are related to combinatorial maps  @xcite , tensor models in dimension three are related to tensor graphs or 3d maps . a certain case of random tensor models , the so - called colored tensor models , have been intensively studied in the recent years ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the graphs associated to these models are regular edge - colored graphs .",
    "an important result is the asymptotic expansion in the limit @xmath1 ( @xmath0 being the size of the tensor ) , an expansion which was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the role played by the genus in the 2d case is played here by a distinct integer called the _ degree_. the dominant graphs of this asymptotic expansion are the so - called melonic graphs , which correspond to particular triangulations of the three - dimensional sphere @xmath2 .",
    "let us also mention here that a universality result generalizing matrix universality was obtained in the tensor case in @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting combinatorial approach for the study of these colored graphs was proposed recently by guru and schaeffer in @xcite , where they analyze in detail the structure of colored graphs of fixed degree and perform exact and asymptotic enumeration .",
    "this analysis relies on the reduction of colored graphs to some terminal forms , called _",
    "schemes_. an important result proven in @xcite is that the number of schemes of a given degree is finite ( while the number of graphs of a given degree is infinite ) .",
    "nevertheless , a certain drawback of colored tensor models is that a large number of tensor graphs is discarded by the very definition of the model .",
    "thus , a different type of model was initially proposed in @xcite , the 3d multi - orientable ( mo ) tensor model .",
    "this model is related to tensor graphs which correspond to 3d maps with a particular eulerian orientation .",
    "the set of mo tensor graphs contains as a strict subset the set of colored tensor graphs ( in 3d ) .",
    "the asymptotic expansion in the limit @xmath1 for the mo tensor model was studied in @xcite , where it was shown that the same class of tensor graphs , the melonic ones , are the dominant graphs in this limit . the sub - dominant term of this expansion was then studied in detail in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we implement a guru - schaeffer analysis for the mo random tensor model .",
    "we investigate in detail the general term of the asymptotic expansion in the limit @xmath1 . as in the colored case ,",
    "this is done by defining appropriate terminal forms , the schemes .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis is somehow more involved from a combinatorial point of view , since , as already mentioned above , a larger class of 3d maps has to be taken into consideration .",
    "also an important difference with respect to the colored model , which only allows for integer degrees , is that the mo model allows for both half - odd - integer and integer degrees .",
    "this leads to the the fact that the dominant schemes are different from the ones identified in @xcite for the colored model ( interestingly , in both cases , dominant schemes are naturally associated to rooted binary trees ) .",
    "let us also mention that the analysis of this paper may further allow for the implementation of the the so - called _",
    "double scaling limit _ for the mo tensor model .",
    "this is a particularly important mechanism for matrix models ( see again @xcite ) , making it possible to take , in a correlated way , the double limit @xmath1 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a variable counting the number of vertices of the graph and @xmath5 is some critical point of the generating function of schemes of a given degree .",
    "in this section we recall the main definitions related to mo tensor graphs .",
    "a _ map _ ( also called a fat - graph ) is a graph ( possibly with loops and multiple edges , possibly disconnected ) such that at each vertex @xmath6 the cyclic order of the @xmath7 incident half - edges ( @xmath7 being the degree of @xmath6 ) in clockwise ( cw ) order around @xmath6 is specified .",
    "a _ corner _ of a map is defined as a sector between two consecutive half - edges around a vertex , so that a vertex of degree @xmath7 has @xmath7 incident corners .",
    "a _ 4-regular map _ is a map where all vertices have degree @xmath8 .",
    "a _ multi - orientable tensor graph _",
    ", shortly called mo - graph hereafter , is a 4-regular map where each half - edge carries a sign , @xmath9 or @xmath10 , such that each edge has its two half - edges of opposite signs , and the two half - edges at each corner also have opposite signs .",
    "in addition , for convenience , the half - edges at each vertex are turned into 3 parallel strands , see figure  [ fig : exemple_mo_graph ] for an example .    the strand in the middle is called _ internal _ , the two other ones are called _",
    "external_. an external strand is called _ left _ if it is on the left side of a positive half - edge or on the right side of a negative half - edge ; an external strand is called _ right _ if it is on the right side of a positive half - edge or on the left side of a negative half - edge .",
    "a _ face _ of an mo - graph is a closed walk formed by a closed ( cyclic ) sequence of strands .",
    "external faces ( faces formed by external strands ) are the classical faces of the 4-regular map , while _ internal faces _ ( faces formed by internal strands ) , also called _ straight faces _ thereafter , are not faces of the 4-regular map . note also that external faces are either made completely of left external strands , or are made completely of right external strands ; accordingly external faces are called either left or right .",
    "we finally define a _ rooted mo - graph _ as a connected mo - graph with a marked edge , which is convenient ( as in the combinatorial study of maps ) to avoid symmetry issues ( indeed , as for maps , mo graphs are _",
    "unlabelled _ ) .",
    "the _ degree _ of an mo - graph @xmath11 is the quantity @xmath12 defined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 are respectively the numbers of connected components , vertices , and faces ( including internal faces ) of @xmath11 . for @xmath15 and @xmath16 two mo - graphs , denote by @xmath17 the mo - graph made of disconnected copies of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "note that the quantities @xmath14 for @xmath11 result from adding the respective quantities from @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "hence we have :    [ claim : disconnected ] for two mo - graphs @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the degree of @xmath17 is the sum of the degrees of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in particular , the degree of an mo - graph is the sum of the degrees of its connected components .",
    "that @xmath12 follows from the following observation  @xcite : @xmath11 gives rise to three 4-regular maps @xmath18 ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , called the _ jackets _ of @xmath11 , which are obtained from @xmath11 by deleting straight faces ( resp . deleting right faces , deleting left faces ) , see figure  [ fig : jacketex ] for an example . note that @xmath18 is an orientable map , while @xmath19 and @xmath20 are typically only locally orientable ( in a usual ribbon representation , edges have twists ) .",
    "let @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 be the respective genera of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( since @xmath18 is orientable , @xmath24 , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 are in @xmath25 ) .",
    "let @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 be the numbers of left faces , right faces , and straight faces of @xmath11 . denoting by @xmath29 the number of edges of @xmath11 , the euler relation gives @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 . since @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( because the map is 4-regular ) we conclude that @xmath35 we call @xmath36 the _ ( canonical ) genus _ of @xmath11 .",
    "an mo - graph @xmath11 is called _ planar _ if @xmath37 .",
    ".,width=377 ]      seeing edges as directed from the positive to the negative half - edge , mo - graphs may be seen as 4-regular maps where the edges are directed such that each vertex has two ingoing and two outgoing half - edges , and the two ingoing ( resp .",
    "two outgoing ) half - edges are opposite , see figure  [ fig : exemple_mo_graph_oriented ] for an example .",
    "we call _ admissible orientations _ such orientations of 4-regular maps .",
    "this point of view of mo - graphs as oriented 4-regular maps is quite convenient and will be adopted most of the time in the rest of the article ( except when we need to locally follow the strand structure ) .",
    "note that the left faces are directed counterclockwise ( ccw ) , and the right faces are directed cw ; and the straight faces are closed walks that alternate in direction at each vertex they pass by .",
    ", represented as an oriented 4-regular map.,width=302 ]    since straight faces alternate at each vertex they pass by , straight faces have even length .",
    "note also that admissible orientations are completely _ characterized _ by the property that the faces of the 4-regular map ( not including the straight faces ) are either cw or ccw ; this is also equivalent to coloring the faces of the map in two possible colors , say red or blue , such that at each edge there is a blue face on one side and a red face on the other side ( this is also directly visible given the definition with strands , where right faces are red and left faces are blue , see figure  [ fig : exemple_mo_graph ] ) .",
    "in other words , a 4-regular map can be endowed with an admissible orientation iff the dual of every of its connected components is a bipartite quadrangulation . if this is the case , and if there is a marked directed edge in each connected component , then there is a unique admissible orientation that fits with the prescribed edge directions ( existence follows from the above discussion , and there is clearly a unique way to propagate the directions starting from the marked directed edges ) .",
    "recall that , in the context of maps , a _ rooted map _ means a connected map with a marked directed edge .",
    "the above paragraph yields the following statement , which we think is worth mentioning even if it will not be needed to perform the combinatorial study ( scheme extraction and associated analysis ) of mo - graphs :    [ rk : bij_4regular ] rooted mo - graphs having genus @xmath38 and @xmath39 vertices may be identified with rooted 4-regular maps having genus @xmath38 and @xmath39 vertices , and with the property that the dual rooted quadrangulation is bipartite ( these are themselves well - known to be in bijection with rooted connected maps having genus @xmath38 and @xmath39 edges ) . in genus",
    "@xmath40 ( planar case ) , all rooted 4-regular maps have this property .",
    "we conclude this subsection with a simple lemma relating the degree and the genus to the number of straight faces :    [ lem : straight_faces ] let @xmath11 be a connected mo - graph .",
    "let @xmath41 be the number of vertices , @xmath28 the number of straight faces , and for each @xmath42 , @xmath43 the number of straight faces of length @xmath44 in @xmath11 .",
    "then the quantity @xmath45 satisfies @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath38 are respectively the degree and the genus of @xmath11 .",
    "hence @xmath48 .",
    "since the number @xmath29 of edges is twice the number of vertices , we have @xmath49 , so that @xmath50 , hence @xmath51 . let @xmath26 , @xmath27 be the numbers of left faces and right faces of @xmath11 .",
    "we have seen in section  [ sec : degree ] that @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 substracting the sum of the two last equalities from the first one , we obtain : @xmath55 so that @xmath56 .",
    "[ rk : doodles ] for @xmath37 , according to remark  [ rk : bij_4regular ] , rooted mo - graphs correspond to rooted 4-regular planar maps .",
    "seeing such a map as the planar projection of an entangled link that lives in the 3d space ( vertices of the map correspond to crossings , where the under / over information is omitted ) , @xmath28 is classically interpreted as the number of _ knot - components_. lemma  [ lem : straight_faces ] gives @xmath57 . since @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the extremal cases are : ( 1 ) @xmath60 , in which case @xmath61 ; ( 2 ) @xmath62 , in which case @xmath63 ( the mo - graph of figure  [ fig : exemple_mo_graph_oriented ] , having @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and thus @xmath66 , is intermediate ) . while the case @xmath60 is combinatorially well - understood ( as will be recalled in section  [ sec : extract_melon_free_core ] ) , the case @xmath62 is notoriously difficult : in that case , 4-regular planar maps are projected diagrams of one - component links ( i.e. , knot diagrams ) , see  @xcite and references therein .",

    "hence these schemes are exactly the dominant schemes at degree @xmath47 .",
    "each rooted binary tree with @xmath268 leaves gives rise to @xmath273 dominant schemes .",
    "indeed , at each inner node , one has to decide whether it is occupied by the cycle - graph or by the quadruple - edge graph , and in the second case , one has to choose among the three possible configurations for the free edge ( the unique edge not involved in any connection ) since the straight face passing by the free edge can go either toward the left child , or the right child , or the parent .",
    "finally , one has to decide at each non - root leaf if it is occupied by the cw or the ccw infinity graph .    as we have recalled in section  [ sec :",

    "let @xmath12 , and let @xmath277 be the ( finite ) set of reduced schemes of degree @xmath47 . for each @xmath278 ,",
    "let @xmath279 be the generating function of rooted melon - free mo - graphs of reduced scheme @xmath109 , where @xmath97 marks half the number of non - root vertices ( i.e. , for @xmath280 , a weight @xmath281 is given to rooted mo graphs with @xmath44 non - root vertices ) .",
    "let @xmath108 be half the number of non - root standard vertices of @xmath109 , @xmath245 the number of broken chain - vertices , @xmath282 the number of unbroken chain - vertices of type @xmath112 or @xmath125 , @xmath283 the number of even straight chain - vertices , and @xmath284 the number of odd straight chain - vertices .",
    "the generating functions for unbroken chains of type l ( resp .",
    "r ) is clearly @xmath285 , the one for even straight chains is @xmath286 , the one for odd straight chains is @xmath287 , and the one for broken chains is @xmath288 .",
    "therefore @xmath289 denoting by @xmath81 the total number of chain - vertices and by @xmath290 the total number of straight chain - vertices , this simplifies as @xmath291 it is well - known that the generating function of rooted melonic graphs is given by @xmath292 in addition , a rooted melon - free mo - graph with @xmath44 non - root vertices has @xmath293 edges ( recall that the root - edge is split into two edges ) where one can insert a rooted melonic graph .",
    "therefore , defining @xmath294 , the generating function @xmath295 of rooted mo - graphs of reduced scheme @xmath109 is given by @xmath296 and the generating function @xmath297 of rooted mo - graphs of degree @xmath47 is simply given by @xmath298 as discussed in  @xcite , @xmath299 has its main singularity at @xmath300 , @xmath301 , and @xmath302 .",
    "therefore , the dominant terms are those for which @xmath245 is maximized . as shown in section  [ sec : dominant ] , these schemes are naturally associated to rooted binary trees with @xmath269 inner nodes , as stated in proposition  [ prop : structure_dominant ] . for a fixed rooted binary tree @xmath303 with @xmath269 inner nodes , the total contribution of schemes arising from @xmath303 to the generating function of rooted melon - free mo - graphs of degree @xmath47 is @xmath304 indeed , such schemes have @xmath272 , @xmath305 , @xmath306 , each of the @xmath142 non - root leaves is occupied either by the cw or ccw infinity graph , and each of the @xmath269 inner nodes is either occupied by the cycle - graph or the quadruple - edge graph that has @xmath71 possible configurations .",
    "hence the total contribution to the generating function of rooted mo - graphs is @xmath307 this is to be multiplied by the catalan number @xmath308 of rooted binary trees with @xmath269 inner nodes .",
    "note that , by design , the dominant schemes contribute only to graphs with @xmath67 non - root vertices such that @xmath69 , which is consistent here with the prefactor @xmath309 .",
    "graphs with @xmath67 non - root vertices such that @xmath310 have schemes with strictly less than @xmath246 broken chain - vertices , hence have a singular behaviour of type @xmath311 , with @xmath312 .",
    "after elementary calculations and applying transfer theorems of analytic combinatorics  @xcite , we obtain :    [ prop : asympt ] for @xmath47 and @xmath313 in @xmath25 , let @xmath314 be the number of rooted mo - graphs with @xmath67 vertices and degree @xmath47 .",
    "then , @xmath47 being fixed , for @xmath315 ( and @xmath316 denoting the euler gamma function ) , @xmath317 and @xmath318 .    according to proposition  [ prop : asympt ] , for @xmath274 @xmath314",
    "is asymptotically @xmath319 , where the multiplicative constant involves @xmath308 . as a comparison ,",
    "as shown in  @xcite , for @xmath274 the number @xmath320 of rooted colored graphs ( in dimension @xmath71 ) of degree @xmath47 with @xmath67 vertices is asymptotically @xmath321 , where the multiplicative constant involves @xmath322 .",
    "we also deduce from these estimates that for fixed @xmath274 , the probability that a random rooted mo - graph of degree @xmath47 with @xmath67 vertices ( where @xmath323 ) is a regular colored graph is @xmath324 .",
    "now , going back to remark  [ rk : doodles ] , we can also easily obtain the asymptotic enumeration under the planarity constraint , based on the following :    each rooted melon - free mo - graph whose reduced scheme is dominant is planar .    as shown in section  [ sec : dominant ] , a rooted melon - free mo - graph @xmath11 of degree @xmath325 has a total of @xmath142 loops ( one at each non - root leaf of the associated binary tree , see figure  [ fig : dominant ] ) .",
    "according to lemma  [ lem : remove_loop ] , erasing all these @xmath142 loops yields a ( rooted ) mo - graph @xmath99 of degree @xmath40 , hence a planar mo - graph .",
    "clearly the @xmath142 erased loops can be inserted back without breaking planarity , from which we conclude that @xmath11 is planar .",
    ".,width=302 ]    given any dominant scheme such as shown in figure  [ fig : dominant ] ( naturally drawn following the shape of a rooted binary tree ) , one can easily figure out how to retract / extend some parts of the drawing so as to obtain a planar redrawing , see figure  [ fig : planar_redraw ] .",
    "[ coro : almost_sure ] for each fixed @xmath12 and for @xmath69 , the probability that a rooted mo - graph of degree @xmath47 with @xmath67 vertices is planar tends to @xmath102 as @xmath326 .",
    "it just follows from the observation that the edge - substitution by melonic components clearly preserves planarity , so that all rooted mo - graphs arising from a dominating reduced scheme are planar .",
    "this concludes the proof since these rooted mo - graphs are the ones that dominate the asymptotic expansion .    according to remark  [ rk : doodles ] , in the planar case , rooted mo - graphs correspond ( bijectively ) to rooted 4-regular maps , the straight faces of the mo - graph identify to the knot - components of the map , and",
    "the number of straight faces is equal to @xmath327 , with @xmath41 the number of vertices and @xmath47 the degree . under this rephrasing , proposition  [ prop : asympt ] and corollary  [ coro : almost_sure ]",
    "yield the following :    for @xmath328 and @xmath329 , let @xmath330 be the number of rooted 4-regular planar maps with @xmath67 vertices and @xmath116 knot - components .",
    "then @xmath331 for @xmath332 .",
    "in addition , for each fixed @xmath12 , and for @xmath69 , @xmath333 has the same asymptotic estimate as @xmath314 , given by  .",
    "in this article we have shown that , similarly as in the colored model  @xcite , the combinatorial study of mo - graphs can be done by extraction of so - called _ schemes _ , such that there are _ finitely many _ schemes in each fixed degree @xmath12 .",
    "we have also identified the dominant schemes in each degree , whose shapes are naturally associated to rooted binary trees . having determined the dominant schemes we have obtained an explicit asymptotic estimate for the number of ( rooted ) mo - graphs of fixed degree as the number of vertices tends to infinity .    as already mentioned in the introduction , a first perspective for future",
    "work is the implementation of the double scaling limit for the mo tensor model . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "let us mention that the double scaling mechanism was implemented , for a different type of colored model , in @xcite , using quantum field theoretical - inspired methods ( the so - called intermediate field method ) . from a probabilistic point a view , a different perspective for future work is to investigate whether the new dominant schemes we have exhibited in this paper correspond or not to phases different from the one of branched polymers ( it was recently proved that the melon graphs correspond , from this point of view , to branched polymers @xcite ) .",
    "another appealing perspective is to extend the mo model ( currently only developed in dimension @xmath70 ) and results of this paper to higher dimensions .",
