    "the recent development in electronics , combining the magnetic and semiconducting materials ( so - called magnetoelectronis or spintronics ) , has brought half - metallic ferromagnets , initially predicted by de groot and collaborators in 1983 @xcite , to the centre of scientific research .",
    "these magnetic metals have the peculiarity that the minority - spin band - structure is semiconducting while the majority - spin band - structure is metallic . such half - metals exhibit ,",
    "ideally , a 100% spin polarization at the fermi level and therefore these compounds should have a fully spin - polarized current and should be ideal spin injectors into a semiconductor , thus maximizing the efficiency of spintronic devices  @xcite .",
    "an important part of the scientific effort has been focused on the study and fabrication of half - metallic heusler alloys .",
    "the first family of heusler alloys studied were of the form x@xmath0yz , crystallizing in the @xmath1 structure which consists of four fcc sublattices , where x a high valent transition or noble metal atom , y a low - valent transition metal atom and z an sp element @xcite .",
    "such heusler compounds have attracted a lot of interest due to the possibility to study in the same family of alloys a series of interesting diverse magnetic phenomena like itinerant and localized magnetism , antiferromagnetism , helimagnetism , pauli paramagnetism or heavy - fermionic behaviour @xcite .",
    "the heusler alloys of the second class are of the form xyz , crystallizing in the @xmath2 structure , and consisting of three fcc sublattices ; they are often called half- or semi - heusler alloys in literature , while the @xmath1 compounds are referred to as full heusler alloys .",
    "the interest in these types of intermetallic alloys was revived after the prediction @xcite , using first - principles calculations , of half - metallicity in nimnsb , a half - heusler compound .",
    "the main advantages of heusler alloys with respect to other half - metallic systems ( e.g. some oxides like cro@xmath0 and fe@xmath3o@xmath4 and some manganites like la@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath3 ) @xcite ) are their relatively high curie temperatures @xcite . while for the other compounds the curie temperature is near the room temperature , _ e.g. _ for nimnsb it is 730 k and for co@xmath0mnsi it reaches the 985 k @xcite . and",
    "their structural similarity to the zinc - blende structure , adopted by binary semiconductors widely used in industry ( such as gaas on zns ) .",
    "heusler alloys have been already incorporated in spin - filters @xcite , tunnel junctions @xcite , and gmr devices @xcite .",
    "the most successful recent applications in spintronics concern the half - metallic full heusler alloys .",
    "the group of westerholt has incorporated co@xmath0mnge in the case of spin - valves and multilayer structures @xcite .",
    "the group of reiss managed to create magnetic tunnel junctions based on co@xmath0mnsi @xcite . a similar study by sakuraba and collaborators resulted in the fabrication of magnetic tunnel junctions using co@xmath0mnsi as magnetic electrodes and al - o as the barrier and their results are consistent with the presence of half - metallicity for co@xmath0mnsi @xcite . dong and",
    "collaborators recently managed to inject spin - polarized current from co@xmath0mnge into a semiconducting structure @xcite .    in a recent article",
    "@xcite we have reviewed theoretical results of the basic electronic and magnetic properties of the half - metallic heusler alloys .",
    "the gap has its origin for both the half- and full - heusler alloys in the @xmath7-@xmath7 hybridisation , which is fundamental for understanding their electronic and magnetic properties . for both families of compounds",
    "the total spin magnetic moment scales with the number of valence electrons and can be described by a slater - pauling rule .    in the present contribution",
    "we review our most recent results on the electronic properties of these alloys obtained from first - principles electronic structure calculations . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we summarize our older results ( see references @xcite and @xcite for an extended review ) .",
    "the following sections are dedicated to phenomena which can destroy half - metallicity . in particular section [ sec3 ]",
    "discuss the effect of the lattice parameter , section [ sec4 ] is dedicated to the effect of spin - orbit coupling , section [ sec6 ] to the doping and disorder effects and the formation of defects . in sections",
    "[ sec9 ] and [ sec10 ] we discuss two special cases : the quaternary heusler compounds and the case of half - metallic ferrimagnets , respectively . in section [ sec11 ]",
    "we review the theoretical studies on the behaviour of the half - metallicity and of the magnetization as a function of the temperature . finally in section [ sec12 ] we summarize and conclude our review .",
    "note that the problems of surface / interface states @xcite are reviewed in other papers in this volume .    to obtain these results",
    "we have employed a variety of electronic structure methods each one suitable for the property under investigation .",
    "the results in section [ sec2 ] , [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] have been obtained using the full - potential version of the screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) method @xcite .",
    "the relativistic calculations to produce the orbital moments in [ sec4 ] are performed with the fully - relativistic version of the kkr method where the dirac equation is solved @xcite .",
    "results in sections [ sec6 ] and [ sec10 ] come from the full  potential nonorthogonal local  orbital minimum  basis band structure scheme ( fplo ) @xcite .",
    "finally for the study of the quaternary heusler alloys the kkr method is employed within the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) to simulate the disorder in the crystal @xcite .",
    "the electronic , magnetic and gap properties of half - heusler alloys have been extensively studied in reference @xcite and of full - heusler compounds in reference @xcite .",
    "these results have been extensively also reviewed in reference @xcite and in the introductory chapter of @xcite and the reader is directed to them for an extended discussion . in this section we will only briefly overview these properties .",
    "several heusler alloys have been predicted to be half - metals @xcite ; perhaps the most widely studied among them is nimnsb , the first to be predicted as a half - metal .",
    "the electronic band - structure calculations of nimnsb reveal that for both spin directions there is one band at around @xmath8 ev with reference to the fermi level which arises from the @xmath9 states of the sb atom .",
    "the next three lowest bands are due to the @xmath10 states of sb and accommodate also electrons from the transition metal atoms @xcite .",
    "the ni and mn majority - spin @xmath7 states are energetically close and form a common band .",
    "the situation is different for the minority - spin states : due to the strong exchange splitting of mn , the minority mn @xmath7-states are unoccupied , while the ones of ni are occupied .",
    "the minority - spin gap arises between the bonding and antibonding @xmath7-hybrids created among the mn and ni states ( in this respect , the origin of the gap is similar to the one in compound semiconductors like gaas or znse ) .",
    "the minority - spin bonding states have most of their weight at the ni atom and are occupied , while the antibonding states have their weight mostly at the mn atom and are unoccupied .",
    "this leads to very strong localized spin moments at the mn atoms ( see table [ tableorb ] for the values of the moments ) @xcite .",
    "a simple band counting shows that the total spin moment is exactly 4 @xmath11 for nimnsb ; this is a secial case of the slater - pauling behaviour , leading to integer moments for half - metallic systems .",
    "the total moment of the half - metallic @xmath2 heusler alloys follows a simple rule .",
    "the total number of electrons , @xmath12 , is given by the sum of the number of spin - up and spin - down electrons , while the total moment @xmath13 per unit cell is given by the difference .",
    "since 9 minority bands are fully occupied , we obtain the simple `` rule of 18 '' for half - metallicity in @xmath2 heusler alloys @xcite @xmath14 this behaviour of the total moment resembles the slater - pauling behaviour of the binary transition metal alloys with the difference that in the latter ones the total spin moment decreases with the number of valence electrons @xcite .",
    "the half - heusler alloys with 18 valence electrons ( e.g. , cotisb ) are nonmagnetic semiconductors , where the gap is again created by the @xmath7-@xmath7 hybridization .    in figure [ fig1 ] (",
    "left panel ) we have gathered the calculated spin magnetic moments per formula unit for the half - heusler alloys which we have plotted as a function of the total number of valence electrons .",
    "the dashed line represents the rule @xmath15 obeyed by these compounds .",
    "the total moment @xmath13 is an integer ( in @xmath16 ) , assuming the values 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 if @xmath17 .",
    "the value @xmath18 corresponds to the semiconducting phase and the value @xmath19 to the maximal moment when all 5 majority @xmath7-states are filled .",
    "firstly we varied the valence of the lower - valent ( _ i.e. _ magnetic ) transition metal atom .",
    "thus we substitute v , cr and fe for mn in the nimnsb and comnsb compounds using the experimental lattice constants .",
    "for all these compounds we find that the total spin moment scales accurately with the total charge and that they all present half - metallicity .     of valence electrons per unit cell for all the studied half ( left panel ) and full ( right panel ) heusler alloys .",
    "the dashed line represents the slater - pauling behaviour.,title=\"fig : \" ]   of valence electrons per unit cell for all the studied half ( left panel ) and full ( right panel ) heusler alloys .",
    "the dashed line represents the slater - pauling behaviour.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the second part of this section we discuss the properties of the full - heusler alloys like co@xmath0mnsi and co@xmath0cral .",
    "their electronic and magnetic properties are similar to the half - heusler compounds with the additional complication of the presence of 2 co atoms per unit cell .",
    "in addition to the bands the half - heusler alloys , there are five states exclusively located at the co sites and near the fermi level @xcite .",
    "now , the fermi level is located among these states so that three out of five are occupied and two of them unoccupied leading to smaller gaps .",
    "now there are 12 minority - spin occupied states and the compounds with 24 valence electrons like fe@xmath0vsb are semiconductors .",
    "if v is substituted by a higher - valent atom , spontaneous spin polarization occurs , and the exchange splitting shifts the majority states to lower energies .",
    "thus the extra electrons fill in only majority states : co@xmath0cral ( 27 valence electrons ) has a total spin moment of 3 @xmath11 and co@xmath0mnsi ( 29 valence electrons ) a spin moment of 5 @xmath11 as can be seen in table [ tableorb ] .",
    "the presence of the second co atom has also another important consequence .",
    "now each mn atom has an octehedral environment of co atoms as first neighbours and not four as was the case for comnsb .",
    "this leads to an increased hybridization between the @xmath7 orbitals of the mn and co atoms and the spin moment of co in co@xmath0mnsi is slightly lower than 1 @xmath11 , considerably larger than the co moment in comnsb .    following the above discussion we investigate the slater - pauling behaviour with the `` rule of 24 '' now instead of 18 in the half - heuslers : @xmath20 in figure [ fig1 ] ( right panel ) we have plotted the total spin moments for all the studied compounds as a function of the total number of valence electrons .",
    "the dashed line represents the slater - pauling rule of half - metallic full heusler alloys .",
    "the `` magical number 24 '' arises from the fact that the minority band contains 12 electrons per unit cell : 4 are occupying the low lying @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands of the @xmath21 element and 8 the co - like minority @xmath7 bands ( the mn - co bonding hybrids : @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the non - bonding co states localized only at the co sites : @xmath24 ) . since 7 minority bands ( 2@xmath25co @xmath26 , 5@xmath25mn @xmath7 )",
    "are unoccupied , the largest possible moment is 7 @xmath16 and would occur if all majority @xmath7-states were occupied .",
    "of course it would be impossible to get a compound with a total spin moment of 7 @xmath16 but even @xmath27 is difficult to obtain . as it was shown by wurmehl et al .",
    "@xcite , the on - site correlations in co@xmath0fesi play a critical role for this compound and calculations within the lda+u scheme , rather than the lda , give a spin moment of 6 @xmath16 .",
    "the exchange interactions , stabilizing ferromagnetism , have been studied in reference @xcite using the adiabatic ( frozen - magnon ) approximation to calculate the inter - atomic exchange parameters for the half - heusler alloys nimnsb and comnsb .",
    "the dominant interaction is between the mn atoms .",
    "the magnetic interactions are more complex in full - heusler alloys co@xmath0mnsi and co@xmath0cral @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "ferromagnetism is stabilized by the inter - sublattice interactions between the mn(cr ) and co atoms and between co atoms belonging to different sublattices .    before closing this section",
    "we discuss also the role of the @xmath21-elements in half - metallic heusler alloys .",
    "while the @xmath21-elements are not responsible for the appearance of the minority gap , they are nevertheless very important for the physical properties of the heusler alloys and the structural stability of the @xmath2 structure . there are three important features :    \\(i ) while an sb atom has 5 valence electrons ( 5@xmath28 , 5@xmath29 ) , in the nimnsb compound each sb atom introduces a deep lying @xmath9-band , at about @xmath8 ev , and three @xmath10-bands below the centre of the @xmath7-bands .",
    "these bands accommodate a total of 8 electrons per unit cell , so that formally sb acts as a triply charged sb@xmath30 ion .",
    "analogously , a te - atom behaves in these compounds as a te@xmath31 ion and a sn - atom as a sn@xmath32 ion .",
    "this does not mean , that locally such a large charge transfer exists .",
    "in fact , the @xmath9- and @xmath10-states strongly hybridize with the transition metal ( tm ) @xmath7-states and the charge in these bands is delocalized and locally sb even loses about one electron , if one counts the charge in the wigner - seitz cells .",
    "what matters here is that the @xmath9- and @xmath10-bands accommodate 8 electrons per unit cell , thus reducing the electrons which have to be accommodated by the @xmath7-bands of the tm atoms .",
    "\\(ii ) the @xmath21-atom is very important for the structural stability of the heusler alloys .",
    "for instance , it is difficult to imagine that the calculated half - metallic nimn and ptmn alloys with zinc - blende structure actually exist , since metallic alloys prefer highly coordinated structures like fcc , bcc , hcp etc",
    ". therefore the @xmath21-elements are decisive for the stability of the @xmath2 compounds .",
    "a careful discussion of the bonding in these compounds has been recently published by nanda and dasgupta @xcite using the crystal orbital hamiltonian population ( cohp ) method . for the semiconductor fevsb",
    "they find that , while the largest contribution to the bonding arises from the v-@xmath7 ",
    "fe-@xmath7 hybridization , contributions of similar size arise also from the fe-@xmath7  sb-@xmath10 and the v-@xmath7 ",
    "sb-@xmath10 hybridization .",
    "similar results are also valid for the semiconductors cotisb and nitisn and in particular for the half - metal nimnsb .",
    "since the majority @xmath7-band is completely filled , the major part of the bonding arises from the minority band , so that similar arguments as for the semiconductors apply .",
    "\\(iii ) another property of the @xmath21-elements is worthwhile mentioning : substituting the sb atom in nimnsb by sn , in or te destroys the half - metallicity @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the substitution of ni by co or fe , which is documented in table [ tableorb ] .",
    "the total moment of 4 @xmath16 for nimnsb is reduced to 3 @xmath16 in comnsb and 2 @xmath16 in femnsb , thus preserving half - metallicity . in nimnsn the total moment is reduced only to 3.3 @xmath16 ( instead of 3 ) and in nimnte the total moment increases only to 4.7 @xmath16 ( instead of 5 ) .",
    "thus by changing only the @xmath21-element it is rather difficult to preserve the half - metallicity , since the density of states changes more like in a rigid band model @xcite .",
    "changes of the lattice parameter can influence the electronic and magnetic properties of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 heusler alloys . to the best of our knowledge",
    "no relevant experimental study exists . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the dos of nimnsb and comnsb for the experimental lattice parameter and the ones compressed and expanded by 2 % .",
    "first one sees that , upon compression , the fermi level moves in the direction of the conduction band , upon expansion towards the valence band . in both cases , however , the half - metallic character is conserved . in order to explain this behaviour",
    ", we first note that the position of fermi level is determined by the metallic dos in the majority band .",
    "as we believe , the shift of @xmath33 is determined by the behaviour of the sb @xmath10-states , in particular by the large extension of these states as compared to the @xmath7 states . upon compression",
    "the @xmath10-states are squeezed and hybridize stronger , thus pushing the @xmath7-states and the fermi level to higher energies , i.e. , towards the minority conduction band .",
    "in addition the mn @xmath7 and ni or co @xmath7 states hybridize stronger , which tends to increase the size of the gap while the mn(ni ) @xmath7-bandwidth increases , which tends to shrink the gap .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig2 ] the first of the two effects is stronger leading finally to an increase of the gap width . upon expansion",
    "the opposite effects are observed . in the case of nimnsb and for the experimental lattice",
    "constant the gap - width is @xmath34 0.4 ev . when the lattice is expanded by 2%the gap",
    "shrinks to 0.25 ev and when compressed by 2%  the gap - width is increased to 0.5 ev .",
    "similarly in the case of comnsb , the gap is 0.8 ev for the experimental lattice constant , 0.65  ev for the 2%  expansion and 0.9 ev for the case of the 2%compression .    for the full - heusler alloys",
    "the pressure dependence has been recently studied by picozzi et al .",
    "@xcite for co@xmath0mnsi , co@xmath0mnge and co@xmath0mnsn , using both the lda and the somewhat more accurate gga .",
    "the general trends are similar : the minority gap increases with compression , and the fermi level moves in the direction of the conduction band .",
    "for example in the case of co@xmath0mnsi the gap - width is 0.81 ev for the theoretical equilibrium lattice constant of 10.565  . when the lattice constant is compressed to @xmath34 10.15  , the gap - width increases to about 1 ev .",
    "the calculations show that for the considered changes of the lattice constant of @xmath35 2 % , half - metallicity is preserved",
    ". there can be sizeable changes of the local moments , but the total moment remains constant , since @xmath33 stays within the gap .",
    "the results presented in this section up to now concern the homogeneous change of the lattice constant under hydrostatic pressure .",
    "block and collaborators have studied the effect of tetragonalization on the properties of both nimnsb and co@xmath0cral @xcite .",
    "they found that although tetragonalization largely affected the shape and width of the gap , the systems remained half - metallic for moderate degrees of strain .",
    ".[tableorb ] calculated spin ( @xmath36 ) and orbital ( @xmath37 ) magnetic moments in @xmath16 for the xmnsb half - heusler and x@xmath0yz full - heusler compounds .",
    "the last three columns are the total spin and orbital magnetic moment and their sum , respectively .",
    "the indexes x , y , z refer to the corresponding atoms in the compound .",
    "[ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tablehferri ]    the ideal case for realistic applications would be a half - metallic antiferromagnet rather than the half - metallic ferromagnets .",
    "in such a compound the majority- and minority - spin densities of states are not connected by a symmetry transformation , as for common antiferromagnets and the material is better described as a fully compensated ferrimagnet , having a net magnetic moment that is , due to the half - metallic character , precisely equal to zero .",
    "such a material would have the advantage that due to the absence of a total magnetic moment it would not give rise to stray fields .",
    "van leuken and de groot have suggested a possible route towards a half - metallic antiferromagnet starting from the semiconducting @xmath2-type compound fevsb @xcite . due to the difficulties to construct such a material",
    ", it would be useful to study also the half - metallic ferrimagnetic materials , like femnsb @xcite or the mn@xmath0vz @xcite compounds where the mn and fe or v spin moments are anti - parallel .    in reference",
    "@xcite we studied the possibility of appearance of half - metallicity in the case of the full - heusler compounds mn@xmath0vz where z is an @xmath21 atom belonging to the iiib or ivb column of the periodic table .",
    "total energy calculations have shown that , when z is al , ga , in or sn , the compounds are ferrimagnetic , while the compounds containing si and ge are non - magnetic at the equilibrium lattice constant . a small expansion of the lattice leads to the emergence of ferrimagnetism also in these compounds .",
    "although all compounds are not half - metallic at their equilibrium lattice constant , small expansion of the lattice pushes the fermi level within the gap which is now situated in the majority - spin band contrary to all other full - heusler alloys . in table",
    "[ tablehferri ] we have gathered the atom - resolved and total spin moments for some of the compounds under study , for the largest and smallest lattice parameters for which half - metallicity is present .",
    "the total spin moment is @xmath38 @xmath16 for the mn@xmath0val(ga or in ) compounds which have 22 valence electrons per unit cell and @xmath39 @xmath16 for the mn@xmath0vsi(ge or sn ) compounds with 23 valence electrons ( the negative sign of @xmath13 is according to the convention set by equation  [ eq : sp2 ] ) . thus these compounds follow the slater - pauling behaviour and the `` rule of 24 '' .",
    "the lighter the element and the smaller the number of valence electrons , the wider is the gap and the more stable is the half - metallicity with respect to the variation of the lattice constant .",
    "the discussion so - far has been focused on the magnetic ground state of half - metallic heusler alloys . at elevated temperatures @xmath40 the spin polarization @xmath41",
    "must clearly be reduced , and at the curie temperature @xmath42 it must vanish together with the average magnetization .",
    "an qualitative and quantitative understanding of this effect is interesting from the point of view of basic science , but is also required in order to predict the applicability of half - metals in realistic devices .",
    "a theoretical study of the temperature dependence of @xmath43 requires knowledge of the response of the spectral function ( density of states ) to an increase of the temperature .",
    "this is a two - step process .",
    "firstly , one needs to find the response of the magnetic excitations to temperature .",
    "secondly , the spectral function must be found in the presence of the excitations .",
    "both steps are not trivial , thus suitable approximations are needed . to our knowledge , there have been three different approaches to the subject for the case of half - metallic ferromagnets : a tight - binding approach @xcite , an approach based on constrained density - functional theory combined with the concept of a disordered local moment @xcite , and an approach based on dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite .",
    "skomski and dowben @xcite consider a tight - binding model of a half - metallic ferromagnet .",
    "magnetic excitations , in the form of magnons , will cause a rotation of the spin quantization axis , in general different at each atom @xmath44 , given by a unitary transformation @xmath45 .",
    "this causes a projection of spin - up states of one atom to spin - down states of another .",
    "they arrive at a crude estimate of this spin - mixing contribution to the spin - down dos : @xmath46 , in terms of the spin - up dos @xmath47 , the magnetization @xmath48 at @xmath49 , and at temperature @xmath40 , @xmath50 .",
    "this gives an estimate for the polarization @xmath51 .",
    "this picture is appealing because of its simplicity , and should be correct when the magnetic excitations are predominantly of the heisenberg type and have a long wavelength , i.e. , at low temperatures .",
    "then , the local spin quantization axis is unchanged over large distances ( of the order of a fraction of the magnon wavelength ) , and , at each instant , the material can be considered locally half - metallic ; the reduction of @xmath52 comes about from the angle between the local spin quantization axes and the global axis corresponding to the average magnetic moment .",
    "however , as is argued by leai et al .",
    "@xcite , at higher temperatures the wavelength of the magnetic excitations can become smaller and affect the local electronic structure .",
    "the hybridization between atomic wavefunctions is crucial for the gap , and the hybridization strength can be altered if the local spin axes of neighbouring atoms are different .",
    "therefore , the spectral function should be in principle re - calculated self - consistently in the presence of the excitations . since the characteristic times of magnetic excitations are much longer than the electron hopping times , the adiabatic approximation within density - functional theory can be employed : an external constraint is used to force a non - collinear state , representing the magnon ; under this constraint , the electronic structure is calculated self - consistently within density - functional theory .",
    "such an approach was applied in reference  @xcite , with the conclusion that a non - collinear configuration can affect the hybridization strongly enough that the polarization collapses . in particular , it was found for nimnsb that , under the constraint of a spin spiral , the gap does not close easily , but the minority - spin @xmath7 bands around the gap move in such a way that they cross the fermi level .",
    "because the @xmath7 bands have a high spectral weight , @xmath53 increases abruptly when these reach @xmath33 , and the polarization collapses . the effect was quantified by using the disordered local moment approach . within this method , the magnetic state at @xmath54 is approximated by a state of the form ni(mn@xmath55mn@xmath56 , i.e.",
    ", the spin is flipped a fraction @xmath57 of the mn atoms in a random way , representing a disordered moment at the mn site . for @xmath58 the ferromagnetic ground state",
    "is recovered , while @xmath59 corresponds to @xmath42 .",
    "the electronic structure of this disordered state was found within the cpa and the kkr green function method . in this way",
    ", @xmath52 can be calculated as a function of @xmath60 , and , if @xmath50 is independentlu known , one can find @xmath61 .",
    "the results show a collapse of the polarization at about 0.4@xmath42 , which corresponds to room temperature .",
    "chioncel et al .",
    "@xcite have considered the effect of the dynamic electron - magnon interaction , resulting from electron correlations . according to this picture",
    ", there exist excitations within the ( spin - down ) half - metallic gap as superpositions of spin - up electron states and spin - down electron states with magnons  @xcite .",
    "these excitations , also called non - quasiparticle states , produce at @xmath49 a spectral weight at energies just above @xmath33 ( or just below @xmath33 if the gap is among the majority - spin states ) . for @xmath54 , however , spin - down spectral",
    "weight appears also at @xmath33 , and the polarization is reduced .",
    "this correlation - induced effect depends on the value of the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath62 , and can be captured within the dmft . for the heusler alloy femnsb ,",
    "calculations within the lda+dmft reported in @xcite show that , at @xmath63 , @xmath64 if @xmath65  ev and @xmath66 if @xmath67  ev .",
    "unfortunately , there are not many experimental results concerning the temperature dependence of the polarization in heusler alloys .",
    "one indirect result is provided in reference  @xcite , where tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) data are compared from junctions containing a co@xmath0mnsi heusler alloy as a first electrode with data from junctions with co@xmath68fe@xmath69 or ni@xmath70fe@xmath71 ( the second electrode is in all cases co@xmath68fe@xmath69 , and the barrier is alo@xmath72 ) .",
    "it is shown that , at low temperatures , the co@xmath0mnsi - based junction exhibits an 85% tmr ratio ( relative change of resistance due to a change of alignment of the magnetic moments of the leads ) , while the co@xmath68fe@xmath69- and ni@xmath70fe@xmath71-based junctions exhibit 65% and 70% tmr ratio respectively . at higher temperatures ( above 150  k )",
    "the situation is reversed , with the co@xmath0mnsi - based junction showing a lower tmr ratio ( 30% at 300  k ) than the other two ( 45% at 300  k ) .",
    "this evidence suggests that , at low @xmath40 , co@xmath0mnsi has a higher spin polarization than co@xmath68fe@xmath69 or ni@xmath70fe@xmath71 , but at high @xmath40 , the polarization of the heusler alloy drops more rapidly .",
    "we note here that co@xmath0mnsi has a high curie temperature of 985  k.    more recently , sakuraba and collaborators @xcite managed to grow a co@xmath0mnsi / al - o / co@xmath0mnsi tunnel junction . at low temperatures ( 2  k ) ,",
    "an extremely high tmr ratio of 570% was reported , while with increasing temperature the tmr dropped rapidly , reaching about 67% at 300  k. on the other hand , a co@xmath0mnsi / al - o / co@xmath73fe@xmath74 junction showed a less pronounced decrease of tmr from 160% at 2  k to 70% at 300  k , while a junction co@xmath73fe@xmath74/al - o / co@xmath73fe@xmath74 showed a less drastic decrease of tmr , approximately from 60% to 30% .",
    "the authors of reference  @xcite propose an explanation in terms of spin - flip processes due to magnetic impurities at the interface co@xmath0mnsi / al - o .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that there is a rapid loss of half - metallicity with increasing temperature , causing a decrease of @xmath52 much faster than @xmath60 .",
    "in this review we have given an introduction to the electronic structure and the resulting magnetic properties of half - metallic heusler alloys , which represent interesting hybrids between metallic ferromagnets and semiconductors .",
    "first , we reviewed a few recent results on the electronic properties of these alloys .",
    "the origin of the gap in these half - metallic alloys and its connection to the magnetic properties are well understood .",
    "the gap in half - heuslers arises between the bonding and antibonding @xmath7-hybrids created by the transition metal atoms ( e.g. ni and mn in nimnsb ) . in full - heusler compounds , like co@xmath0mnsi",
    ", there is the extra complication of the appearance of co @xmath7-states which do not hybridize with the mn states .",
    "there are exactly 9 occupied minority - spin states for the half - heuslers and 12 for the full - heuslers ; thus the total spin moment follows a slater - pauling behaviour for both families .",
    "moderate changes of the lattice parameter shift the fermi level , but overall do not affect half - metallicity .",
    "spin - orbit coupling also induces states within the gap but the alloys keep a very high degree of spin - polarization at the fermi level .",
    "orbital moments are small as expected for typical intermetallic ferromagnets .",
    "we discussed the effect of substitutional doping , disorder and defects on the properties of these alloys . in many cases moderate degrees of disorder and doping do not alter half - metallicity . also defects with low formation energies , which are the most likely to occur , keep the half - metallic character of the compounds .",
    "quaternary heusler alloys are a special case of full - heusler alloys where one site is occupied randomly by two chemical elements .",
    "these alloys , when the two extreme normal compounds are half - metallic , follow the slater - pauling behaviour keeping the half - metallicity of the normal heusler alloys .",
    "finally we discuss the appearance of half - metallic ferrimagnetism in mn@xmath0vz ( z and @xmath21 element ) .",
    "the results summarized above contribute in the idea that half - metallic ferromagnets are feasible experimentally since all studied effects keep an almost 100% degree of spin - polarization at the fermi .",
    "however as discussed in the last section temperature effects quickly destroy the half - metallicity and the alloys transit to a normal metal .",
    "moreover , surfaces / interfaces of heusler alloys are known from first principles calculations to show strong surface / interface states which can severely reduce the degree of spin - polarization @xcite .",
    "a theoretical analysis  @xcite shows that interface states at a half - metal / semiconductor interface can reduce the tunneling magnetoresistance ratio significantly .",
