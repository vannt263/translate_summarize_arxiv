    "a domain wall is a prototype collective excitation in a physical system , and it is also the paradigm example of a topological soliton @xcite .",
    "a domain wall can appear whenever there is a global symmetry that becomes spontaneously broken .",
    "it constitutes the boundary that separates two neighbouring domains , in which the order parameter that detects the symmetry breaking has different values .    in the case of a one dimensional heisenberg spin chain",
    "the order parameter is a three component unit length vector .",
    "when one of the three vector components vanishes identically , the heisenberg spin chain reduces to the xy spin chain @xcite .",
    "a domain wall along the spin chain is a localised excitation that interpolates between two different , ordered spin states in which the order parameter has different constant values .",
    "two major types of domain walls are commonly identified along the heisenberg chain @xcite .",
    "these are called the bloch wall and the nel wall , respectively . in the case of a bloch wall",
    ", the heisenberg spin variable rotates through the plane of the wall and in the case of a nel wall the rotation takes place within the plane of the wall itself .",
    "domain walls that are mixtures of these two , can also occur along the heisenberg spin chain , while along the xy spin chain , only domain walls of the bloch type can be present .    in this article",
    "we demonstrate that the formation of super - secondary structures , during folding of a protein @xcite , can be understood in terms of a bloch domain wall that forms along a heisenberg spin chain , or along a closely related xy spin chain .",
    "we propose that the spin chain interpretation of a protein backbone provides a systematic framework for understanding and describing the process of protein folding .",
    "for this we employ all - atom force fields @xcite to scrutinise protein folding dynamics at the level of individual atoms and their oscillations .",
    "we analyse the folding pathway using a combination of topological techniques and global analytic tools .",
    "we isolate the collective oscillations which are pertinent for the folding process , from the noisy background of thermal and random individual atom fluctuations .",
    "in particular , we illustrate how the individual atom motions become organised and combined into a coherent structural excitation which we identify as the bloch wall .    as a concrete example we consider an @xmath0-helical subunit of the hiv envelope glycoprotein gp41 @xcite , with protein data bank @xcite ( pdb ) code 1aik .",
    "there are six @xmath0-helical subunits in the biological assembly , shown in figure 1 .",
    "we consider in isolation the subunit , for which the first amino acid has number 628 in the pdb file . in isolation , the subunit is unstable and starts folding .",
    "the transmembrane glycoprotein 41 is itself a subunit of the retrovirus envelope protein complex . in the case of the hiv ,",
    "its structure has been studied extensively .",
    "it is presumed to have substantial biological relevance to the initial viral infection .",
    "accordingly , the gp41 protein is a popular target for the development of an anti - viral immune response , to prevent and cure hiv infection .",
    "however , medical applications are beyond the direct scope of the present study . here",
    "we shall solely address and identify the physical mechanism , why and how an individual , initially @xmath0-helical subunit of 1aik becomes unstable in isolation , and starts folding .    for our all - atom molecular dynamics simulations ,",
    "we utilise the gromacs 4.6.3 package @xcite .",
    "we analyse the results using a variety of topological techniques and analytical tools .",
    "our approach derives from the mathematical structure of heisenberg and xy spin chains , in combination with properties of a discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in particular , the dnls equation that describes the local extrema of the hamiltonian , enables us to analytically identify the profile of the domain wall , and to interpret it in terms of dnls soliton @xcite .",
    "here we present results from the detailed investigation of a particular example .",
    "however , we expect our observations and conclusions to be generic .",
    "indeed , the present results are fully in line with the previous findings @xcite obtained by using the coarse grained unres energy function @xcite in the case of protein a. the similitude of results that are obtained by analysing the protein folding process using different tools , built and based on phenomena with very different characteristic time and length scales , demonstrates that we have correctly identified the relevant collective motions that command the folding process .",
    "we have performed _ in silico _ experiments to fold one c - chain subunit of the core structure of gp41 @xcite .",
    "the structure comes from the hiv envelope glycoprotein with pdb code 1aik .",
    "the amino acid sequence is @xmath1 these amino acids are assigned the numbers 628 - 661 in the pdb entry of 1aik .",
    "we have used the molecular dynamics package gromacs 4.6.3 @xcite .",
    "we have analysed in detail a number of 80 ns long trajectories , with the crystallographic pdb conformation as the initial condition .",
    "we have chosen the length of the trajectories by inspecting , when major structural deformations take place .",
    "we have employed three different force fields , to eliminate force - field based artifacts .",
    "these are the united - atom force field gromos53a6 , and the all - atom force fields charmm27 and opls / aa .",
    "the 1aik subchain that we have investigated in detail , consists of 34 amino - acid residues , with pdb numbers 628 - 661 .",
    "there are 16200 atoms in the entire system that we have simulated , including the solvent .",
    "the simulation box has dimensions @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "this ensures that there is a 2 nm minimal distance between the protein atoms and the box walls , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we have described the solvent using the spc water model @xcite .",
    "we have neutralised the system at a salt concentration of 0.15",
    "we have used steepest - descent for initial energy minimisation .",
    "the system was warmed up to 290 k by a simulated annealing in a 100 ps position - restraint simulation .",
    "we have chosen this relatively low temperature value for a better control of random thermal noise but without forgoing the underlying physical phenomena . for temperature control",
    "we have employed the berendsen - thermostat with a time constant 0.1 ps , and for pressure coupling  the berendsen - barostat with a pressure set to 1 bar and a time constant 0.5 ps .",
    "constraints on all bonds were imposed with the lincs algorithm @xcite .",
    "we have used the particle mesh ewald ( pme ) method @xcite to compute the long - range electrostatic interactions , with van der waals and coulomb cutoff radii of 0.9 nm .",
    "for the 80 ns production run with a time step of 2 fs , that we analyse here in detail , we have changed the thermostat to v - rescale and the barostat to parrinello - rahman , keeping the initial time constants , to ensure the generation of a proper canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "we have recorded the coordinates every 20 ps , which gives rise to 4000 frames that form the basis for our analysis .",
    "we have introduced , employed and developed a number of topological tools and analytic techniques to analyse and interpret the results of our gromacs simulations .",
    "we monitor the evolution of the protein geometry using frenet frames which are based on the backbone c@xmath0 atoms @xcite .",
    "the framing depends _ only _ on the c@xmath0 atom coordinates @xmath4 , where @xmath5 labels the residues and @xmath6 in the case of 1aik . at a given @xmath4 the frame",
    "consists of the unit backbone tangent ( @xmath7 ) , binormal ( @xmath8 ) and normal ( @xmath9 ) vectors , defined as follows , @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 our aim is to identify and isolate the collective multi - atom motions that drive the protein folding process , from the background of the various random fluctuations .",
    "we expect that such coherent motions and oscillations have characteristic time scales , which are much longer than the period of an individual atom covalent bond oscillation . in average , over the relevant time scales , the distance between two consecutive c@xmath0 atoms can then be taken to be nearly constant , and equal to @xmath13 thus , at relevant time scales , the backbone dynamics can be described entirely in terms of the virtual backbone bond and torsion angles @xmath14 and @xmath15 , as the _ complete structural order parameters _",
    "these angles are defined as follows , @xmath16 where @xmath17   { \\label}{eq : s}\\ ] ] conversely , the frame vectors ( [ eq : t])-([eq : n ] ) can be expressed in terms of these two order parameters iteratively , using the _ discrete frenet equation _",
    "@xcite @xmath18 and the c@xmath0 backbone is calculated from @xmath19 unlike the tangent vector @xmath7 , the normal and binormal vectors @xmath9 and @xmath20 do not appear in equation ( [ eq : dffe ] ) .",
    "thus , if we rotate these two vectors simultaneously around the vector @xmath7 , the c@xmath0 geometry remains intact and only the way how it is framed changes .",
    "in particular , rotation by @xmath21 constitutes the discrete @xmath22 gauge transformation @xmath23 this transformation has been previously used extensively , to analyse protein loop structure @xcite .",
    "it will also be used in the sequel .      according to ( [ eq : dffe ] ) the entire c@xmath0 backbone geometry",
    "is determined by the tangent vectors @xmath24 .",
    "thus , following @xcite we may visualise the backbone geometry in terms of these vectors : we take the base of @xmath7 to be at the location @xmath25 of the @xmath26 c@xmath0 atom .",
    "we identify the tip of @xmath7 as a point on the surface of a unit two - sphere @xmath27 that is centered at the point @xmath25 .",
    "we orient the coordinate system on the sphere so that the north - pole coincides with the tip of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the north - pole is always in the direction of the next c@xmath0 , which is at the site @xmath28 . we proceed to characterise the direction of the next tangent vector @xmath29 _ i.e. _ the direction from @xmath28 towards the c@xmath0 atom at site @xmath30 , in terms of the longitude and latitude angles of the @xmath26 two - sphere @xmath31 . for this",
    ", we translate the center of @xmath27 from @xmath32 towards its north - pole , and all the way to the location @xmath28 of the @xmath33 c@xmath0 atom , without introducing any rotation of the sphere .",
    "we then record the direction of @xmath29 as a point on the surface of the translated @xmath27 .",
    "this defines the coordinate values ( @xmath34 ) , that determine how the backbone chain turns at site @xmath28 , to reach the @xmath35 central c@xmath0 atom at the point @xmath30 : the angle @xmath14 measures the latitude of @xmath29 on the translated two - sphere @xmath27 , from its north pole .",
    "the angle @xmath15 measures the longitude of @xmath29 , starting from the great circle that passes both through the north pole and through the tip of the binormal vector @xmath8 .",
    "when we repeat the above procedure for all c@xmath0 atoms , we obtain a ( @xmath36 ) distribution that characterises the overall geometry of a protein backbone . for a visualisation of this distribution we employ the geometry of a stereographically projected two - sphere",
    ": we project the @xmath37 coordinates from the south pole to the tangent plane of the north pole , of the two - sphere . if ( @xmath38 ) are the coordinates of this tangent plane the projection is defined by @xmath39    when we perform the projection for all c@xmath0 atoms in all crystallographic protein structures in pdb that have been measured with resolution better than 2.0  , we arrive at the statistical angular distribution that we show in figure [ fig-2 ] .",
    "it is the landscape for the shape of the protein backbones from the crystallographic data in pdb . by the way it is obtained",
    ", the crystallographic protein structure should be very close to a stationary minimum of the ensuing gibbs free energy .",
    "thus the figure [ fig-2 ] should be the collective landscape of stationary , minimum - energy protein structures .",
    "we observe that the pdb data is concentrated in an annulus which is roughly between the circles @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the exterior of the annulus @xmath42 is an excluded region , the ensuing conformations are subject to steric clashes .",
    "the interior @xmath43 is sterically allowed but in practice excluded in pdb structures .",
    "note that regular structures such as @xmath0-helices and @xmath44-strands are distinguished as highly localised regions in the figure [ fig-2 ] , with @xmath45 for @xmath0-helices and @xmath46 for @xmath44-strands .",
    "different regions in figure [ fig-2 ] can be connected by loops , which can be considered as trajectories along the variables ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we have found that loops have the tendency to encircle the inner circle . in figure [ fig-3 ]",
    "a ) we show , as an example , a generic loop that connects the right - handed @xmath0-helical region with the @xmath44-stranded region .    to describe a backbone segment analytically , we combine its c@xmath0 s bond and torsion angles into the three component unit vectors @xmath48 we interpret these vectors as the local order parameters along an imaginary _ linear _ one dimensional heisenberg spin chain , labeled by the index @xmath49 .",
    "this converts the c@xmath0 geometry into a configuration along a linear heisenberg chain in a one - to - one manner : in figure [ fig-3](b ) we have sketched how the ( generic ) trajectory shown in figure [ fig-3](a ) appears , figuratively , in terms of such a heisenberg spin chain configuration .",
    "since the spin variable ( [ si ] ) takes values only in the annulus @xmath50 of the two - sphere @xmath51 , it is apparent that a loop can be _ de facto _ identified as a domain wall akin the bloch wall along a heisenberg chain .",
    "the loop then interpolates between the two different regular secondary structures , denoted by state a and state b respectively , as shown in the figures 3 .",
    "the amino acid side chains can be similarly interpreted in terms of a one dimensional linear spin chain .",
    "in fact , there are several ways to identify the spin chain variable . here",
    "we utilise the directional vector that points from the c@xmath0 atom at @xmath32 towards the ensuing c@xmath44 atom , located at @xmath52 .",
    "this vector can be introduced for all amino acids except glycine ( g ) ; note that there is no glycine in ( [ lets ] ) .",
    "we start with the unit vector @xmath53 we recall the c@xmath0 based discrete frenet framing with the coordinates ( @xmath34 ) and represent ( [ sideo3 ] ) as three component unit vectors in this coordinate system , @xmath54 here ( @xmath55 ) are the spherical coordinates of the @xmath26 c@xmath44 atom , on the surface of the c@xmath0 centered two - sphere @xmath27 . in figure [ fig-4 ]",
    "we show the distribution of the vectors ( [ cbetai ] ) on the surface of the two - sphere , for all those crystallographic pdb structures that have been measured with resolution better than 1.0  .",
    "note that the sphere is the same as in figures [ fig-2 ] and [ fig-3](a ) but now there is no stereographic projection .",
    "we can interpret the distribution in figure [ fig-4 ] as the c@xmath44 landscape of stationary folded protein structures with minimum gibbs energy .",
    "the highly localized character of the distribution shows that there is a very strong correlation between the c@xmath0 ( backbone ) geometry and the c@xmath44 ( side chain ) geometry .",
    "accordingly , the ground state structures of the corresponding heisenberg spin chain hamiltonians must be very similar .",
    "we proceed to introduce a set of o(2 ) spin variables for the side - chain c@xmath44 . for this",
    "we define the projection of ( [ sideo3 ] ) onto the normal plane at the position of the @xmath26 c@xmath0 , @xmath56 for the next c@xmath44 along the chain , we introduce similarly the vector @xmath57 and compute its projection onto the _ same _ normal plane  at the position of the @xmath26 c@xmath0 , @xmath58 we then define the relative angle @xmath59 , @xmath60 as shown in figure [ fig-5 ] , @xmath59 is the dihedral angle @xmath61 we note that the construction resembles that of newman projection in stereochemistry .    in analogy with figure [ fig-3](b )",
    "we identify the variable @xmath59 as an order parameter for a linear o(2 ) xy spin chain , @xmath62    like the heisenberg model , the xy model supports domain walls that interpolate between two configurations where the order parameter has different constant values .",
    "the domain wall of the xy model is akin the bloch domain wall of a heisenberg model .",
    "figure [ fig-4 ] shows that the ground state structure of the side chain xy model is closely related to that of the backbone heisenberg model , in the case of crystallographic pdb protein structures .",
    "the formation , evolution and structure of a loop along a folding protein can be monitored in terms of topologically determined folding indices .",
    "here we are interested in two particular examples of folding indices , one that relates to the backbone geometry and another one that relates to the side chain geometry .    in the case of a heisenberg spin chain",
    ", there is a topological index akin a winding number that characterises and classifies its bloch domain walls . for the c@xmath0 bloch wall shown in figure [ fig-3 ]",
    "a ) , b ) this topological index counts the net number of times the corresponding trajectory encircles around the annulus in the figure _",
    "i.e. _ around the north - pole of the two - sphere .",
    "we remind that due to steric constraints , the heisenberg variable ( [ si ] ) takes values in the annulus shown in figures [ fig-2 ] , [ fig-3 ] a ) .",
    "we also recall that for the first homotopy class of a circle @xmath63 which justifies the introduction of a topological concept .",
    "analytically , we may assign to each loop , and more generally to a backbone segment , between residues @xmath64 and @xmath65 the following folding index @xmath66 @xcite , @xmath67   { \\label}{eq : gamma}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 here @xmath69 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath70 .",
    "note that @xmath71 is the total rotation angle ( in radians ) that the projections of the c@xmath0 atoms of the consecutive loop ( segment ) residues make around the north pole .",
    "the @xmath72 label the first and last residue of the loop .",
    "commonly these are the last _ resp .",
    "_ first residues in the preceding and in the following regular secondary structures .",
    "the folding index is a positive integer when the rotation is counterclockwise , and a negative integer when the rotation is clockwise .",
    "the folding index can be used to classify individual loop structures and backbone segments , even entire protein backbones @xcite .",
    "note that the folding index is normalised so that it is equal to twice the number of times the vector in figure [ fig-3](b ) rotates around its axis , when the spin structure traverses a domain wall _",
    "i.e. _ it assigns an even integer to the @xmath63 winding number , in the case of a closed trajectory .",
    "for example , for the trajectory shown in figures [ fig-3 ] the folding index has the value -1 . for a loop connecting an @xmath0-helix and a @xmath44-strand ,",
    "the folding index is generically an odd integer . for a loop connecting two @xmath0-helices , or two @xmath44-strands ,",
    "the folding index is generically an even integer .    in the case of the side chains ,",
    "we utilise the c@xmath44 angular xy spin variable ( [ etai ] ) to define a similar topological folding index @xcite . for this",
    ", we first choose a reference residue , _",
    "e.g. _ the @xmath73 residue along the backbone . starting with this reference residue ,",
    "we then evaluate the accumulated _ total _ angle @xmath74 over a segment with @xmath75 residues , @xmath76 and we define the ensuing index by @xmath77 { \\label}{eq : etaprime2}\\ ] ] again , the index acquires its topological justification from the fact that @xmath78 .",
    "the dihedral @xmath79 , the accumulated total angle ( [ eq : etaprime ] ) and the ensuing index ( [ eq : etaprime2 ] ) can all be used to study and classify loop structures , protein segments , and entire proteins .",
    "sect : landau    a generic all - atom molecular dynamics simulation of a folding protein contains a wide range of intermediate conformations .",
    "some of these are essential for the correct folding pathway , while some are merely random transients with no inherent relevance to the folding process _ per se_. in order to identify the relevant conformational processes , we need systematic methods that smooth over and weave out the irrelevant random fluctuations .",
    "for this we recall the standard wilsonian universality arguments @xcite , to deduce the form of the landau free energy that emerges from the thermodynamical gibbs free energy . in the present context",
    ", the derivation is based on the following two assumptions @xcite :    @xmath80 we assume that the characteristic length scales that are associated with spatial variations and deformations along the protein backbone around its thermal equilibrium configuration , are large in comparison to the covalent bond lengths .",
    "this presumes that there are no abrupt edges but only gradual slowly varying bends and twists along the backbone . from figures [ fig-2 ] and [ fig-4 ]",
    "we conclude that the steric constraints between the backbone and the side chain atoms act as powerful inhibitors of sharp , edgy motions .",
    "@xmath80 we also assume that the individual c@xmath0 virtual bond length oscillations have characteristic time scales , which are very short in comparison to the time scale which characterise a folding process .",
    "the characteristic time scale of a random covalent bond oscillation is around ten femtoseconds while in our simulations we record the individual atomic coordinates every 20 picosecond .",
    "we have tested that conformational changes which take place over shorter time scales , do not affect our conclusions .",
    "accordingly , we may adopt ( [ eq : aveva ] ) as the ( time averaged ) value for all the nearest neighbour c@xmath0-c@xmath0 distances .",
    "it has been shown that in the case of crystallographic pdb structures , the bond and torsion angles ( @xmath34 ) form a _",
    "complete set of structural order parameters _",
    "accordingly , in the vicinity of a gibbs free energy minimum we may expand the free energy in terms of these angles .",
    "for this we consider the response of the interatomic distances to variations in these angles , with @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the distance between _ any _ two c@xmath0 atoms @xmath83 and @xmath84 along the backbone .",
    "suppose that at a given local extremum of the free energy , the c@xmath0 bond and torsion angles have the equilibrium values @xmath85 we then consider a non - equilibrium conformation where the ( @xmath34 ) deviate from these extremum values .",
    "we denote the deviations by @xmath86 when the deviations are slowly varying in space , _ i.e. _ ( [ devi ] ) are small , we may taylor expand the gibbs free energy around the extremum , @xmath87 \\ = \\ ] ] @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 the first term in the expansion evaluates the free energy at the extremum . since ( @xmath91 ) correspond to the extremum , the second term vanishes .",
    "thus we are left with the following expansion of the averaged free energy ,",
    "@xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 when the characteristic length scale of spatial deformations around a minimum energy configuration is large in comparison to a covalent bond length , we may _ re - arrange _ the expansion ( [ fene ] ) in terms of the differences in the angles as follows : first come local terms , then come terms that connect the nearest neighbours , then come terms that connect the next - to - nearest neighbours , and so forth .",
    "when we re - order the expansion ( [ fene ] ) in this manner and demand that the free energy is invariant under local rotations in the ( @xmath95)-plane , we conclude @xcite that to the leading order the expansion of the gibbs free energy _ necessarily _ coincides with the energy of the following discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 + \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1 }   ( \\kappa_{i+1 } - \\kappa_{i})^2   { \\label}{e2old}\\ ] ] this functional form of the free energy is simply the most general landau free energy that one can write down using the available variables ( @xmath99 ) , in a manner which is consistent with the symmetry principle that a local rotation of the ( @xmath100 ) frames has no effect on the backbone geometry .",
    "the corrections to ( [ e1old ] ) include next - to - nearest neighbours couplings and so forth , which are higher order terms from the point of view of our systematic expansion .",
    "we note that the expansion ( [ e1old ] ) has the property that in continuum limit it yields the coleman - weinberg derivative ( low momentum ) expansion @xcite @xmath101 where , following @xcite , we have identified the bond angle with the complex scalar field @xmath102 and the torsion angle with the u(1 ) gauge field @xmath103 , in the continuum limit .",
    "we _ emphasize _ that the approximation ( [ e1old ] ) is valid in the limit of slow spatial variations ( low momentum ) .",
    "that is , as long as there are no abrupt , sharp edges but only gradual bends and twists along the backbone . in particular , long range interactions are accounted for as long as they do not cause any localised sharp buckles along the backbone , and the angular variations respect the steric constraints .",
    "the wilsonian universality arguments are sufficient to conclude that in the limit of slowly varying backbone geometry _ any _ complete all - atom force field can be approximated by the energy function ( [ e1old ] ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 depend on the atomic level physical properties and the chemical microstructure of the protein and its environment . in principle",
    ", these parameters can be computed from this knowledge .",
    "but as always in the case of a landau free energy , it remains a challenge to compute these parameters from the all - atom level .",
    "sect : solitons    the free energy ( [ e1old ] ) relates to the dnls energy function @xcite .",
    "the non - linear , quartic bond angle contribution is the familiar double - well potential that gives rise to a spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath22 symmetry @xmath109 the spontaneous breakdown of this discrete symmetry is pivotal for the emergence of a loop structure , in the case of proteins .",

    "however , we obtain an _ excellent _ approximation @xcite by _ naively _ discretising the continuum dark nonlinear schrdinger equation soliton ( [ eq : cosh ] ) @xmath137 + \\mu_{2 } \\ , \\exp\\left [ - \\sigma_{2 } ( i - s)\\right ] } { \\exp\\left [ \\sigma_{1 } ( i - s ) \\right ] +   \\exp\\left[- \\sigma_{2 } ( i - s)\\right ] }   { \\label}{eq : bond2}\\ ] ] here @xmath138 \\ { \\rm mod}(2\\pi)$ ] are parameters , which determine the amplitude of the variation of @xmath133 and the asymmetry of the inflection regions .",
    "the parameters @xmath139 and @xmath140 are related to the inverse of the range of the inflection region .",
    "we remark that in the case of proteins , the values of @xmath141 are determined entirely by the adjacent helices and strands .",
    "furthermore , far away from the soliton center we have in analogy with ( [ asymp ] ) @xmath142 the corresponding torsion angles are evaluated in terms of the bond angles using equation ( [ tauk ] ) .    note that in the case of proteins , the profile of equation ( [ eq : bond2 ] ) becomes monotonically increasing when we add multiples of @xmath143 to the experimental values . since the values of @xmath144 s are defined @xmath145 , this does not affect the backbone geometry .",
    "the integer number of times the monotonically increasing variable @xmath14 covers its fundamental domain @xmath146 counts the number of solitons along the backbone .",
    "recall that negative values of @xmath14 are related to positive values of @xmath14 by @xmath22 symmetry ( [ eq : dsgau ] ) .",
    "finally , _ only _ the parameters @xmath139 and @xmath140 in ( [ eq : bond2 ] ) are intrinsically specific parameters for a given loop .",
    "but they specify only the length of the loop , not its shape which is determined _ entirely _ by the functional form of equation ( [ eq : bond2 ] ) and , as in the case of @xmath147 and @xmath148 , they are combinations of the parameters in equation ( [ u ] ) .    in the expression ( [ tauk ] ) of the torsion angles @xmath149 , there are only two independent parameters @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "consequently the profile of @xmath15 is determined entirely by @xmath14 , and by the structure of the adjacent regular secondary structures .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that most crystallographic protein structures in pdb can be described with very high precision in terms of such soliton profiles as their modular building blocks .",
    "moreover , it has been found that in the ensuing soliton profiles , the number of parameters is generically much smaller than the number of residues . thus , the energy function ( [ e1old ] ) has a very high predictive power , in describing folded proteins structures in pdb .",
    "its predictions can be subjected to stringent experimental scrutiny , both in the case of static and dynamic proteins .",
    "we now proceed to demonstrate , that all the concepts and structures we have identified are observed during an all - atom simulation of protein folding .",
    "we start with individual atom level scrutiny , even though our goal is to identify and model those _ collective _ conformational deformations that cause a protein to fold .",
    "we inquire how does self - organisation , in the case of a protein , relate to universal concepts such as formation of domain walls along spin chains .",
    "we study how accurately can the dynamics and structure of the important collective deformations be modelled by soliton profiles such as the one described by the dnls equation .",
    "we have subjected the single c - chain subunit of the core structure of gp41 @xcite with pdb code 1aik and residues 628 - 661 , to detailed all - atom simulations .",
    "we have used the gromacs 4.6.3 .",
    "package @xcite with three different force fields  gromos53a6 , charmm27 and opls / aa  having thus the protein described by 383 , 573 and 609 atoms , respectively .",
    "the final production simulation models 80 ns of the protein evolution . we have concluded this to be sufficient , to identify and analyse the important structural deformations that can take place .        in figure [ fig-6](a )",
    "we show the secondary structure of the final conformations that we have obtained using the three force fields , in our 80 ns simulations .",
    "we observe a clear deformation , in a segment that consists of the first 10 residues from the n - terminal ( upper part in the figure ) .",
    "in figure [ fig-7 ] we display the weighted root - mean - square - deviation ( rmsd ) of the protein backbone in the three force fields , @xmath152^{1/2 } { \\label}{rmsd}\\ ] ]    here @xmath153 is the position of the atom @xmath49 at time @xmath154 , and @xmath155 where @xmath156 are the individual atom masses , and @xmath157 is the total mass of the backbone .",
    "the deformation is most intense in the gromos53a6 force field . with this force field ,",
    "the initial @xmath0-helical structure begins collapsing within 45 ns . with the opls / aa force field",
    ", we find that the deformation starts after around 40 ns . in the case of the charmm27 force field",
    ", the helix tends to remain intact within the selected time range .",
    "the deformation begins only after a substantially longer simulation .",
    "apparently , this force field has a tendency to produce structures that have an overly @xmath0-helical content .",
    "after extended comparisons of the three force fields , including different time steps and simulation lengths , we have chosen a 80 ns gromos53a6 force field trajectory with 2 fs time step , for the final production simulation that we analyse here .",
    "qualitatively , the results that we present are independent of the force field and time step that we have chosen .      in figure [ fig-8 ]",
    "we show the results from a do.dssp @xcite secondary structure analysis , in the case of the gromos53a6 simulation .",
    "the following _ qualitative _ observations can be made :    @xmath80 after around 4 - 5 ns corresponding to frames 200 - 250 , there is an initial formation of a coil structure , according to do.dssp classification .",
    "the coil becomes initially stabilised around residue number 29 which corresponds to amino acid number 656 in the pdb file .",
    "the coil is connected to the c - terminal with a bend . at around 8 ns ( around frame 400 )",
    "there are helical fluctuations in this structure towards n - terminal , and at around 22 - 24 ns ( frames 1100 - 1200 ) the coil structure moves back towards the c - terminal .",
    "the motion takes place in two steps , at around frame 1200 and then again at around frame 2800 after which the coil disappears , by merging into the apparently random fluctuations of the c - terminal residues .    at the level of do.dssp secondary structure analysis the coil which emerges near the c - terminal and propagates along the backbone , is putatively akin the propagating loop structure that has been previously identified and studied in coarse grained unres simulations of the protein g related albumin - binding domain with pdb code 1gab @xcite .",
    "in particular the unres simulation @xcite identifies a displaced protein loop as a localised structure with a profile that can be described by the soliton solution of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ tauk ] ) , ( [ nlse ] ) .",
    "the simulation demonstrated that when the loop - soliton moves along the protein lattice , with cells matching the residues , there are waves that are emitted in its wake as vibrations in the lattice structure .",
    "these waves drain the kinetic energy of the soliton , and cause it to decelerate .",
    "eventually the kinetic energy of the soliton becomes depleted , and it can no longer cross over the energy barriers between lattice cells and becomes localised around a particular set of lattice cells .",
    "the energy barriers that prevent the soliton from translating along the backbone lattice were identified as peierls - nabarro barriers @xcite in @xcite .    in the present case of the c - terminal coil ,",
    "there is apparently a peierls - nabarro barrier that stops and prevents the coil that is supposedly modelled by a dnls , from propagating away from the c - terminal beyond the residues 28 - 29 . instead it becomes initially trapped , then moves towards the c - terminal and dissolves there .",
    "the soliton moves step - wise , it s crossing - over the ensuing peierls - nabarro barriers is boosted by thermal fluctuations .",
    "the soliton crosses a barrier whenever the amplitude of its thermal fluctuations exceeds the barrier - specific threshold value .",
    "@xmath80 at around the same time when the c - terminal coil forms , we observe a turn deformation that forms and proceeds away from the n - terminal , and then fluctuates thermally between residues 5 and 10 . after around 20 ns ( frame 1000 ) of simulation time",
    ", there is a rapid extended turn - like fluctuation that connects the n - terminal with a localised structure which is identified as a short coil by do.dssp .",
    "this is an apparent dnls soliton , emerging at the end of the extended turn - like structure and stabilising around the residues 6 - 8 ( residues 634 - 636 in the pdb file ) .",
    "we observe initially relatively strong fluctuations in the residues between the putative soliton and the n - terminal .",
    "but the amplitudes of these fluctuations become damped and after around 50 ns ( frame 2500 ) there are only minor fluctuations in the soliton .",
    "there is a bend between the soliton and the n - terminus which constitutes a peierls - nabarro barrier , high enough to prevent the soliton from moving towards the n - terminal , step - wise by thermal fluctuations .",
    "we proceed to analyse the dynamics _",
    "quantitatively _ , and we start with the backbone folding index ( [ eq : gamma ] ) . for this",
    "we have divided the backbone into segments of varying length , and computed the folding index over the segments during the 80 ns time evolution .",
    "examples of results are shown in figure [ fig-9 ] , where we plot the numerical values of the folding index density ( [ eq : foldind ] ) .",
    "the first segment consists of the sites 4 - 11 corresponding to residues 632 - 639 in pdb .",
    "this segment covers the n - terminal soliton structure ( see figure [ fig-8 ] ) .",
    "the second segment consists of the sites 24 - 30 ( 652 - 658 in pdb ) .",
    "this covers the segment where the c - terminal coil initially appears in figure [ fig-8 ] .",
    "we observe the following :    * figure [ fig-9](a ) : * initially , the folding index of the segment 4 - 11 vanishes .",
    "but in the vicinity of frame 1000 , coinciding with the formation of the n - terminal coil / soliton in figure [ fig-8 ] , the folding index starts fluctuating between the values @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "we note how the pattern of the oscillations reflects the structural changes in the region between the coil and the n - terminal , shown in figure [ fig-8 ] : there are first fluctuations between turn and bend , during frames 1000 - 1500 .",
    "when the oscillations in the values of the folding index diminish and vanish near the frame 1500 , we observe a formation of helical structure between the coil and the n - terminal in figure [ fig-8 ] .",
    "the folding index then starts oscillating between the values @xmath160 , and this corresponds to a frame segment where the helix converts into a turn in the figure [ fig-8 ] . at around the frame",
    "2500 , the folding index finally stabilises to the final value @xmath161 .",
    "this stabilisation concurs with the formation of a bend between the coil and the n - terminal , in figure [ fig-8 ] .",
    "* figure [ fig-9](b ) : * we observe the increase of folding index from @xmath162 to @xmath163 near frame 200 , and subsequent decrease back to @xmath162 near frame 1300 . according to figure [ fig-8 ] ,",
    "these transitions coincide with the appearance of the c - terminal soliton , and its subsequent propagation towards the c - terminal , away from the segment 24 - 30 .",
    "accordingly , we have found that the variations in the values of the folding index , in particular in the case of the n - terminal soliton , coincide with the structural deformations that take place along the backbone segment which is located between the soliton and the n - terminal . in particular",
    ", the final stabilisation of the folding index concurs with the crossing over the peierls - nabarro barrier and subsequent stabilisation of the soliton , according to figure [ fig-8 ] .",
    "moreover , the c - terminal soliton emerges with @xmath163 and remains stable until the peierls - nabarro barrier crossing takes place .",
    "the evolution of the ensuing folding index is also fully in line with the results that we deduce from do.dssp .",
    "we conclude that the behaviour in the backbone segment , surrounding the soliton , directly correlates with the topological character of the soliton , in both cases .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig-10 ] we show the folding index density ( [ eq : foldind ] ) over the _ entire _ backbone and for all the 4000 frames .",
    "we observe that :    @xmath80 initially , the folding index vanishes .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath0-helical structure of the 1aik sub - chain .",
    "but there is a sudden initial transition to the value @xmath163 , presumably reflecting the initial stages of c - terminal soliton formation .",
    "@xmath80 up until the frame @xmath164 the folding index tends to vanish .",
    "but there are fluctuations , mainly between values @xmath165 which reflect the various processed that take place near the terminals .",
    "@xmath80 in the vicinity of frame 2700 there is a transition , and the value of the folding index starts stabilising toward the value @xmath163 .",
    "this stabilisation concurs with the stabilisation of the n - terminal soliton , and the final departure of the c - terminal soliton .",
    "the fluctuations also shift , oscillating between @xmath166 and @xmath167 and this shift is identified by the yellow arrows in the figure .    in figure [ fig-11 ]",
    "we show a close - up to the last 50 frames in figure [ fig-10 ] .",
    "it confirms the stabilisation of the folding index towards the value @xmath163 , with occasional fluctuations where @xmath168 or @xmath169 .    in figure [ fig-12 ] ,",
    "following figure [ fig-3](a ) , we show the full trajectory for the entire final frame 4000 .",
    "the trajectory starts from the n - terminal which is located in the @xmath44-stranded region of figure [ fig-2 ] .",
    "it moves over to the @xmath0-helical region , then return to the @xmath44-stranded region to encircle the north pole .",
    "finally , the trajectory merges and ends with the @xmath0-helical region .",
    "the trajectory confirms that the final structure at frame 4000 indeed does support a twisting @xmath170 and that the twisting is furthermore located at the n - terminal soliton .",
    "the stabilisation of the folding index to the value @xmath163 confirms the global character of the remaining n - teminal soliton structure : there is a total twisting by @xmath170 along the final backbone , in comparison to the initial configuration and including the terminal residues , and this twisting is localised on the n - terminal soliton .",
    "moreover , we observe that the n - terminal residues are in a @xmath44-stranded position while the c - terminal residues are in the @xmath0-helical position .",
    "figure [ fig-4 ] shows the landscape of the ground state ( crystallographic structure ) c@xmath44 atom directions in the c@xmath0 centered discrete frenet frames .",
    "figure [ fig-13 ] shows how the directions of the c@xmath44 evolve during our entire gromos53a6 simulation .",
    "we find it remarkable how similar the dynamical landscape of figure [ fig-13 ] is with the static ground state landscape shown in figure [ fig-4 ] : the direction of c@xmath44 nutates _ tightly _ around its static ground state landscape . clearly , there must be strong correlations between the backbone c@xmath0 and side chain c@xmath44 , during the entire dynamics .",
    "accordingly , the information content in the angles @xmath59 in ( [ etai ] ) , ( [ etai2 ] ) should correlate strongly with the c@xmath0 geometry changes during the dynamical process .",
    "more generally , we expect that the various backbone and side chain spin models that we have introduced , are all in the same dynamical universality class .",
    "figure [ fig-14 ]    shows the residue - wise accumulated distribution of all the individual angles @xmath59 in ( [ etai ] ) _ i.e. _ the ensuing landscape of the individual @xmath59 during the entire 80 ns gromos53a6 simulation .",
    "the conclusions that can be deduced from this figure are in line with those in figure [ fig-8 ] .",
    "in particular , we observe the presence of the n - terminal soliton , how it is centered around residues 5 - 6 .",
    "we also observe that the residues between sites 6 - 27 are in a helical position during the entire time evolution .",
    "we also observe the merging of the c - terminal soliton with the fluctuations of the c - terminal .",
    "figure [ fig-15 ] shows the time resolved landscape of all the @xmath59 angles .",
    "there is a remarkable similarity between this figure , and the figure obtained from the do.dssp backbone analysis shown in figure [ fig-8 ] . in particular , the formation and stabilisation of the n - terminal soliton around sites 5 - 6 is clearly visible .",
    "the appearance of the c - terminal soliton and its subsequent evolution is similarly visible : we observe how this soliton is formed at around frame 200 , and then propagates towards the c - terminal in a stepwise manner , crossing over the various peierls - nabarro barriers and eventually merging with the c - terminal thermal fluctuations .",
    "finally we note the apparent similarities between the structure of the landscape in figure [ fig-15 ] and the behaviour of the folding index density in figure [ fig-10 ] .",
    "we proceed to analyse the detailed properties of soliton structure and formation",
    ". our main focus will be on the n - terminal soliton structure .",
    "we are particularly interested in the phenomena that take place when the soliton is formed , _",
    "i.e. _ the vicinity of the frame @xmath1711000 , and when the soliton moves over to a peierls - nabarro barrier and stabilises , _",
    "i.e. _ the vicinity of the frame @xmath1712500 .",
    "we start with a closeup of the c - terminal part in figure [ fig-15 ] , shown in figure [ fig-16 ] .",
    "we observe how , in terms of the side chain @xmath59 angles , the soliton structure which forms with center at residue 28 subsequently propagates back - and forth , in a step - wise manner , towards the c - terminal .",
    "eventually it merges with the terminal , and dissolves into its fluctuations .",
    "the soliton motion is fully in line with figure [ fig-8 ] , and the initial motion is consistent with the folding index analysis in figure [ fig-9](b ) . in particular , the step - wise propagation of the soliton is fully consistent and in line with the presence of peierls - nabarro barriers .",
    "these barriers are high enough to trap the soliton momentarily , but low enough for the soliton to eventually cross over them when its thermal excitation energy fluctuates to high enough value .",
    "we remind that the present simulations have been performed at 290 k. we have chosen this relatively low temperature value , from the _ in vivo _ perspective , in order to restrain the soliton mobility and to dampen noisy thermal fluctuations .",
    "figure [ fig-17 ] shows a close - up of the n - terminal part in figure [ fig-15 ] , from two complementary perspectives .",
    "the soliton appears in the vicinity of frame 1000 .",
    "it subsequently translates one residue towards the n - terminal , in the vicinity of frame 2500 .",
    "this is an apparent crossing over a peierls - nabarro barrier by thermal fluctuation , and it is followed by a stabilisation of the soliton at the final position . note the correlation between the soliton motion and the extent of the n - terminal fluctuations .",
    "figure [ fig-18 ]    shows the evolution of the individual @xmath59 angles in ( [ eq : etaprime ] ) , in the case of the n - terminal soliton structure .",
    "the panels display the deviation of @xmath59 from the initial average value for residues @xmath172 , which we have found to be those of primary interest . for @xmath173 and for @xmath174 and larger , the deviations from the initial average value fluctuate around zero .",
    "in figure [ fig-19 ] we scrutinise those segments of figure [ fig-18 ] , where the @xmath175 branch of the angle needs to be carefully resolved .",
    "in each of the panels in figure [ fig-19 ] we display the data in figure [ fig-18 ] , over a subset of frames and now evaluated around the value @xmath176 : in figure [ fig-19](a ) we show the segment 1500 - 2500 of figure [ fig-18](a ) , in figure [ fig-19](b ) we show the segment 2000 - 3000 of figure [ fig-18](b ) and in figure [ fig-19](c ) we show the segment 500 - 1500 of figure [ fig-18](c ) .    by combining figures [ fig-18 ] and [ fig-19 ]",
    "we conclude that there are two major transitions , around frames 1000 and 2500 respectively .",
    "these transitions are concurrent with the major transitions in figures [ fig-8 ] , [ fig-15 ] , [ fig-17 ] and in particular figure [ fig-9 ] .",
    "the first transition corresponds to the creation of the n - terminal soliton , and the second one to its translation , by one site towards the n - terminal , and subsequent stabilisation .",
    "we also observe the presence of an extended transition process , visible in figure [ fig-18](b ) between frames 1100 - 1500 . in summary , we conclude from these figures that :    @xmath80 in the vicinity of the frame 1000 , when the n - terminal soliton structure forms , there is an initial twisting of the @xmath177 dihedral which is close to @xmath178 and a twisting of the @xmath179 dihedral by an approximatively equal amount but in the opposite direction .",
    "thus , at this point the total twisting which is produced along the side chain segment vanishes .",
    "we note that the presence of two twists by an equal amount but opposite in direction , is the hallmark of a bloch domain wall pair production .",
    "but we recall that the backbone folding index detects only a single soliton , as shown in figure [ fig-9](a ) .",
    "@xmath80 after the initial bloch wall pair formation , the @xmath177 dihedral becomes slowly twisted back to the original value between frames 1200 - 1600 , so that after frame 1600 we are left with a total of @xmath180 twist .",
    "this process leaves us with a single soliton along the chain segment , with a total twisting around @xmath181 .",
    "@xmath80 finally , in the vicinity of frames 2100 - 2200 , we observe a rapid twisting of the @xmath182 dihedral by an amount close to @xmath183 .",
    "this is followed , in the vicinity of the frame 2400 - 2500 , by a twisting of the @xmath177 dihedral by an approximatively equal amount .",
    "there is an accompanying twist of the @xmath179 dihedral by an amount somewhat less than @xmath184 , over the same frames .",
    "these two twistings at @xmath185 accompany the peierls - nabarro barrier crossing , as can be deduced by comparison with figures [ fig-15 ] and [ fig-17 ] .",
    "@xmath80 when the soliton stabilises , after frame 3000 , we conclude that there is a total twisting in the side chain structure which is close to @xmath186 , and carried by the final soliton configuration .",
    "thus we assign to the final soliton the value @xmath187 of the index ( [ eq : etaprime2 ] ) .",
    "note that there is also certain ( small ) spillage of the @xmath188-values which is distributed among the nearby residues .    in summary",
    ", the side chain analysis shows that at the level of the xy spin chain analysis , the n - terminal soliton structure forms by an initial rapid formation of a bloch domain wall _",
    "i.e. _ soliton - antisoliton pair , followed by a slow twisting that apparently removes one of the two bloch wall solitons .",
    "this is then followed by a rapid transition , in combination with a peierls - nabarro barrier crossing , that forms the final stable soliton structure .",
    "accordingly , we may characterise the final soliton as a configuration with the c@xmath0 backbone folding index @xmath169 and the side chain xy folding index @xmath187 .",
    "figure [ fig-13 ] revels the presence of strong correlations between backbone and side chain dynamics .",
    "in particular , any formation of side chain soliton structure should correlate with the formation of corresponding backbone soliton .",
    "accordingly , we proceed to construct explicitly the backbone soliton that accompanies the n - terminal side chain soliton .",
    "we shall find that the backbone soliton can be modeled by a solution of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ tauk ] ) , ( [ nlse ] ) , with very high sub - atomic precision .",
    "as an example , we consider the profile of the n - terminal soliton structure at two different frames . other frames , and the c - terminal soliton structure , can be analysed similarly .",
    "we select the sites 4 - 11 ( pdb sites 632 - 639 ) for our analysis : the sites 0 - 3 are subject to fluctuations , and beyond the site 11 there is only a monotonic @xmath0-helix .",
    "we start with the frame 2000 , which is located in the regime where the side chain structure of the soliton has stabilised according to figure [ fig-18](b ) and the backbone folding index of the segment shown in ffigure [ fig-9](a ) has the value @xmath163 ; the side chain index over this segment is @xmath189 , according to figures [ fig-18 ] , [ fig-19 ] .    in figure [ fig-20 ]",
    "we show the profile of the bond angle and the torsion angle over the segment 4 - 11 ( sites 632 - 639 in the pdb file ) in the frame 2000 , after we have implemented the @xmath22 gauge transformation ( [ eq : dsgau ] ) to identify the soliton profile .",
    "note that in order to compute a single bond angle , we need to know three residues while the evaluation of a torsion angle consumes four residues .",
    "thus , despite the smaller number of data points in the figure , the ensuing configuration engages 8 residues .",
    "we observe that the bond angle has the profile of a single domain wall soliton of the dnls equation , approximated by ( [ kappaprof ] ) .",
    "we use the software package propro that has been described at @xmath190 to numerically construct the ensuing soliton solution of the dnls equation .    in figure [ fig-21 ] ( a ) we compare the profile of the bond and torsion angles in figure [ fig-20 ] with the profile of the soliton solution of ( [ tauk ] ) , ( [ nlse ] ) .    in figure [ fig-22 ] ( top )",
    "we compare the residue - wise distance between the all - atom configuration of frame 2000 , and the dnls solution .",
    "the average c@xmath0 rmsd between the two configurations is less than 0.1 ngstrm , and at no residue is the distance between the c@xmath0-atoms more than 0.2 ngstrm : the difference is truly negligible .",
    "the grey strip around the dnls soliton is a 0.2 ngstrm ( quantum mechanical ) fluctuation band @xcite .",
    "the figure [ fig-22 ] ( bottom ) shows the 3d overlay of the ensuing c@xmath0 backbones , for all practical purposes they are the same .    in figure [ fig-23 ]",
    "we show the loop trajectories of the all - atom configuration of frame 2000 , and the corresponding dnls soliton , on the stereographically projected two - sphere of figure [ fig-2 ] and [ fig-3 ] .",
    "note that for both of these two loop trajectories the folding index , as defined in ( [ eq : gamma ] ) is vanishing , in that the trajectory does not encircle the north - pole ( center of the disk ) . a very short change either in the position of the residue labeled @xmath125 or in the position of the residue labeled c in figure [ fig-23 ] a ) , can shift the trajectory",
    "so that the line connecting them moves over to the other side of the north pole and the folding index becomes @xmath191 .",
    "this is consistent with the result shown in figure [ fig-9 ] that the folding index fluctuates between the values @xmath162 and @xmath191 , around the frame 2000 , with the posture shown in figure [ fig-23 ] being the more stable one .    in figure [ fig-24 ]",
    "we show a close - up to the frame segment 2475 - 2525 around the soliton 2000 , in terms of the side chain angles @xmath188 .",
    "the close - up reveals the presence of fluctuations between the soliton and the n - terminal , while the helix between the soliton and the c - terminal displays very small fluctuations .",
    "thus , the fluctuations in the folding index around the frame 2000 are most likely due to shifts in the position of the residue labeled b in figure [ fig-23 ] ( a )",
    ".    figures [ fig-25]-[fig-28 ] show the same analyses for the conformation in frame 3500 .",
    "we find that the dnls soliton describes the domain wall soliton that we have constructed by all - atom simulations , with a very high sub - atomic precision .",
    "we note that the soliton in frame 3500 is a configuration that connects between the @xmath44-stranded region of figure [ fig-2 ] to the @xmath0-helical region , while in the case of the soliton at frame 2500 the initial residue is located in a sparsely populated region of the landscape in figure [ fig-2 ] .",
    "the major qualitative difference between frames 2000 and 3500 is between figures [ fig-23 ] and [ fig-28 ] .",
    "the soliton in frame 3500 is relatively stable . in particular , as shown in figure [ fig-9 ] , its folding index @xmath163 .",
    "we can understand the stability of the folding index by comparing figure [ fig-23 ] ( a ) with figure [ fig-28 ] ( a ) . in the later , the residues have assumed positions where the connecting arrows are stabilised against small perturbations , they are protected from crossing over the north pole in a manner that causes fluctuations in the value of the folding index .    finally , we compare the structure of the solitons at frames 2500 and 3500 . from figures",
    "[ fig-20 ] , [ fig-25 ] we observe that in terms of the bond angles the soliton 3500 has indeed moved one site towards the n - terminal , from the position of soliton 2500 . in figure [ fig-29 ]",
    "we overlay their 3d structures . for this",
    ", we first translate the soliton in frame 3500 one residue away from the n - terminal , so that the two have the same location along the backbone .",
    "the figure shows the ensuing 3d interlaced c@xmath0 backbones , in a relative position where the rmsd is minimal .",
    "there is a visible difference , and the minimal rmsd is 2.0  ; the soliton has clearly become deformed .",
    "molecular dynamics enables the scrutiny of protein folding , at the level of individual atoms and over very short time intervals .",
    "however , it can leave us with the conceptual challenge to understand , how the individual atoms cooperate to produce the kind of large scale organisation that appears to be prevalent among crystallographic protein structures .",
    "we have performed detailed molecular dynamics simulations , with the aim to find out how organised structure emerges when a protein folds .",
    "we have first compared three different force fields using the gromacs 4.6.3 .",
    "package , to select the proper tools .",
    "we have chosen a c - chain subunit from hiv envelope glycoprotein with pdb code 1aik as a concrete example , partly due to its biomedical relevance even though this is an issue which has not been addressed by us .",
    "we have introduced and further developed various tools of modern theoretical physics , to systematise and analyse the data .",
    "these include topological tools , conceptual analogies drawn from the notion of spin chains , the notion of wilsonian universality , and methods based on the analytical structure of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation . in this manner",
    "we have arrived at the conclusion that the protein folding is a process that relates intimately to the emergence and interactions of solitons . in particular , a configuration such as the bloch domain wall along a spin chain appears to be most useful in comprehending how structure emerges and self - organises when a protein folds .    we have inspected both the static and dynamic properties of domain wall solitons and observed that concepts which are familiar from the study of lattice systems , such as the peierls - nabarro barrier , also appear along protein backbones lattices , and in fact assume a central role in dictating how the folding proceeds . we hope that our observations help to pave a way for the powerful analytical and topological tools and techniques that have been introduced and developed in the context of integrable spin chains and related solvable models , to become part of the arsenal used describe emergence of structure and organisation in the case of proteins and other biological macromolecules .",
