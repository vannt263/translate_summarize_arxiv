    "the origin of cosmic magnetic fields in the early universe is one of the most actual problems of high energy physics .",
    "numerous theoretical descriptions of large - scale magnetic field generation are discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "one of the elegant mechanisms is the spontaneous vacuum magnetization at high temperature .",
    "the possibility of the phenomenon has already been shown by both the analytical and numerical methods in the su(2 ) gluodynamics @xcite , in the su(3 ) gluodynamics @xcite , in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "the stability of the spontaneously generated fields at high temperature was shown in ref .",
    "actually , the spontaneous vacuum magnetization is one of the distinguishable features of asymptotically free theories @xcite .    in the su(2 ) gluodynamics only one neutral magnetic field can be spontaneously generated , whereas in the su(3 ) gluodynamics there are two possible spontaneously generated neutral chromomagnetic fields ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 in case of the standard gell - mann matrices ) .",
    "the spontaneous vacuum magnetization phenomenon was investigated for the su(2 ) gluodynamics on a lattice in @xcite , where the magnetic field was introduced with the twisted boundary conditions .",
    "the magnetized state was obtained by comparison of the free energies for the trivial vacuum state ( @xmath2 ) and the magnetized vacuum state ( @xmath3 ) . in this paper",
    "we propose a new approach to study the effect .",
    "in contrast to setting external fields on a lattice , it should be reasonable to try to detect the presence of the condensed fields directly in the standard monte carlo ( mc ) techniques .",
    "in @xcite the spontaneous generation of neutral su(3 ) fields in the high - temperature limit @xmath4 was studied by analytical perturbative methods and the possibility of vacuum magnetization was shown .",
    "nevertheless , the question about simultaneous generation of neutral chromomagnetic fields in the su(3 ) gluodynamics still remains .",
    "in particular , the mutual spatial orientation of these fields should be qualified .    in the present paper the spontaneous vacuum magnetization at high temperature",
    "is investigated in the su(3 ) gluodynamics on a lattice .",
    "we developed the procedure for detection of the condensate fields by direct analysis of lattice gauge configurations .",
    "this procedure is general for the deconfinement phase of any su(@xmath5 ) lattice gauge theory .",
    "it is grounded on the statistical analysis of chromomagnetic fields extracted from lattice configurations .",
    "the cartesian components of quantum chromomagnetic fields have to be maxwell distributed in simulations , whereas the presence of condensate fields should change this distribution .",
    "relative spatial direction of the condensed chromomagnetic fields is a priori unknown and can be treated as a random quantity .",
    "the complete electromagnetic tensor can be directly measured by taking the trace of a plaquette multiplied additionally by the gauge group generators .",
    "the deconfinement phase is spatially homogeneous , so the field tensor can be averaged over a lattice configuration to estimate the homogeneous vacuum state beyond quantum fluctuations .",
    "the statistical distribution of these averages is comparing with the maxwell distribution to detect possible condensates .",
    "we show that the vacuum is magnetized for both the neutral fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 whereas for the other fields the vacuum magnetization is absent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "2 provides the theoretical background of our approach to detect the condensed chromomagnetic fields .",
    "the results of monte - carlo simulations are described in sect .",
    "the temperature behavior of the condensate fields is derived and compared with known results from the literature in sect .",
    "the discussion and possible applications are provided in sect .",
    "we consider su(@xmath5 ) gauge theory on a lattice with the standard wilson action @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the inverse coupling , @xmath8 denotes the @xmath9 identity matrix , and @xmath10 is the plaquette variable .",
    "the sums run over all the lattice sites @xmath11 and directions @xmath12 , and the isotropic lattice spacing @xmath13 is supposed .",
    "the plaquette is constructed from the lattice field variables  links , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath16-th su(@xmath5 ) group generator , and @xmath17 is the field potential in the continuous limit .",
    "links ( [ u ] ) are subject to mc simulations .",
    "we implement standard boundary conditions : the sites on the opposite lattice edges are simply looped by the proper links .",
    "the result of a mc run is a boltzmann sequence of configurations with some numeric values for links .",
    "then , any physical observable can be measured for each configuration and averaged over the boltzmann ensemble .",
    "we are interested to detect a kind of savvidy vacuum in the deconfinement phase of the su(3 ) gluodynamics .",
    "this means possible existence of a homogeneous field strength in the whole volume being a background of quantum fluctuations .",
    "in contrast to the confinement phase , which can be spatially fragmented to bound states , the deconfinement phase always occupy the whole lattice , so the homogeneous vacuum can be extracted as the field strength averaged over all the lattice sites .",
    "actually , the huge lattices can show some domain structure , but relatively small lattices are expected to produce the condensate in some random direction .",
    "the first step to detect a non - trivial vacuum state is the measurement of the field strength by a given lattice configuration .",
    "in fact , the field strength enters the plaquette variable used to construct the wilson action ( [ s ] ) .",
    "let us recall the plaquette definition : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the unit vector in direction @xmath20 .",
    "the expansion of link variables ( [ u ] ) for small lattice spacing is well known ( see for example @xcite ) : @xmath21 by applying the trace , one immediately obtains the field strength squared , which gives the correct continuous limit for the wilson action .",
    "as far as the wilson action is considered as a good approach to field strength squared , we can use the same plaquette to extract the field strength ( its flux through the plaquette , actually ) .",
    "this could be done by multiplying plaquette ( [ pf ] ) by generators @xmath15 , then taking the trace : @xmath22 + \\mathcal{o}(a^4).\\ ] ] we will concentrate on the chromomagnetic part of the field tensor @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the average of the chromomagnetic components of ( [ f ] ) over a simulated lattice configuration gives us a direct measurement of the homogeneous chromomagnetic field generated spontaneously in the deconfinement phase , which will be called the _ condensate _ for brevity . in",
    "what follows we will mark these averaged values as @xmath26 , where vector means spatial direction .",
    "these values are distributed within the boltzmann ensemble with some probability density function @xmath27 ( p.d.f . ) .",
    "we suppose cartesian components of @xmath26 to be gaussian with the variance @xmath28 , which is usual in mc simulations . the variance can be easily measured as the sample variance taken by the mc run .",
    "then , the simulated field strength @xmath26 is described by the following p.d.f .",
    ", @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the condensate .",
    "the spatial direction of @xmath30 appears to be unknown at each configuration generated in the mc run .",
    "it is random ( at least , it has a random part ) , so p.d.f .",
    "( [ g ] ) could be written accurately as @xmath31 .",
    "this is the reason against naive average of the cartesian components of @xmath26 over the run as a way to extract the condensate value from the generated boltzmann ensemble .",
    "actually we are not interested in the random direction of @xmath30 , the question is what the absolute value of the condensate . using the spherical coordinates , we can rewrite probability in terms of the absolute values of the vectors , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the angle between @xmath26 and @xmath30 , and @xmath36 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "let us notice that the absolute value of the condensate @xmath33 is not random .",
    "it is a well known fact , that the cosine of the angle between two random spatial vectors is distributed uniformly .",
    "it allows us to integrate ( [ gs ] ) over angular variables obtaining the p.d.f . for the absolute value of the field strength : @xmath37 as a result , we get the value of the condensate @xmath33 as a parameter of the distribution of some directly measured variable .",
    "thus , we can determine @xmath33 by analysis of the mc statistics obtained for @xmath32 .    in case of condensate absence ,",
    "@xmath2 and p.d.f .",
    "( [ d ] ) becomes the ordinary maxwell distribution .",

    "( [ d ] ) in dimensionless ( normalized ) terms .",
    "let us introduce the quantity @xmath38 which is just the mean value of @xmath32 in case of @xmath2 .",

    "as it can be seen , the neutral su(3 ) component @xmath1 has the condensate whereas there is no condensate for the charged component @xmath49 .",
    "it should be noted that the condensation is also present for the neutral su(3 ) field @xmath0 and absent for all the charged fields @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as it can be expected from the theoretical reasons .",

    "fields @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 behave similarly  they demonstrate the absence of condensates .    thus , to find the spontaneously generated field strength one should measure the field tensor components @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 in lattice simulations , average them over configurations ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) , calculate their variance over the run ( @xmath28 ) , compute the absolute values ( @xmath62 ) and their mean value over the run ( @xmath63 ) . then , solving eq .",
