    "one of the most important discoveries from extragalactic observations at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths has been the identification of a class of `` luminous infrared galaxies '' ( ligs ) , objects that emit more energy in the infrared ( @xmath15500@xmath2 ) than at all other wavelengths combined ( see @xcite for a comprhensive review ) .",
    "the first all - sky survey at far - infrared wavelengths carried out in 1983 by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) resulted in the detection of tens of thousands of galaxies , the vast majority of which were too faint to have been included in previous optical catalogs .",
    "it is now clear that part of the reason for the large number of detections is the fact that the majority of the most luminous galaxies in the universe are extremely dusty .",

    "1 ) they are mergers of evolved gas - rich giant spiral galaxies ( e.g. milky way with andromeda ) , and not  primival \" galaxies .",
    "2 ) to boost the luminosity above 10@xmath32 l@xmath33 the nuclei must have approached at least 10 kpc , namely , they are advanced mergers .",
    "3 ) due to the gravitational impact the interstellar gas decouples from the stars and large amounts of interstellar matter fall at high rates to the central region .",
    "this is the condition to produce a nuclear starburst , and/or feed a supermassive black hole at super - eddington accretion rates . to produce such large accretion rates , the gravitational potential wheels of massive buldges",
    "are needed .    a workshop on the question concerning the ultimate source of energy ( starbursts versus agn s ) took place in ringberg on october 1998 .",
    "below 2 10@xmath32 l@xmath33 starbursts dominate the energy budget , but above 3 10@xmath32 l@xmath33 agn s seem to be always present and become an important source of energy . in this respect it is interesting to note that it is found with iso that in the prototype seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 , about 80% of the mid - infrared flux between 4 and 18 @xmath13 m comes from the agn @xcite .",
    "a caveat for the subject of this conference is that the pre - encounter objects that merged at high redshifts must have been different from the metal - rich evolved galaxies merging at present .",
    "another caveat is that ultraluminous ir galaxies at high redshifts may be very difficult to detect using the lyman break technique . due to the large amounts of dust in ultraluminous objects ,",
    "very little or none continuum leaks out at ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "therefore , surveys with submillimeter arrays as alma will be needed to detect ultraluminous galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the starbursts in ultraluminous galaxies take place in the nuclear region .",
    "one of the new findings with iso is a class of very luminous dust - enshrouded extranuclear starbursts in nearby spiral - spiral mergers .",
    "when the pre - encounter galaxies do not have prominent buldges , namely , when the mergers are -for instance- two sc galaxies , the most luminous starbursts may take place in extranuclear regions that are inconspicuous at optical wavelengths .",
    "these extranuclear starbursts have sizes @xmath0 100 pc in radius and can produce up to 50% of the overall mid - infrared output from these systems .",
    "furthermore , the analyses of the mid - infrared spectra indicate that the most massive stars in these systems are formed inside these optically invisible knots .    in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "is shown in contours the mid - infrared ( 12 - 17 @xmath13 m ) image of the antennae galaxies obtained with iso @xcite , superimposed on the optical image from hst .",
    "below are shown representative spectra of the two nuclei and the brightest mid - infrared knot .",
    "it shows that the most massive stars are formed in an obscured knot of 50 pc radius , which produces about 15% of the total luminosity from the antennae galaxies between 12.5 and 17 @xmath13 m .",
    "a more extreme case is found in ngc 3690 @xcite , where it is observed an extranuclear region @xmath0100 pc in radius that radates @xmath145% of the overall mid - infrared output from this system .",
    "if the fraction of far - infrared fluxes is the same as in the mid - infrared , such compact region produces a luminosity of 2 10@xmath34 l@xmath33 . therefore , the luminosity of a few compact starburst knots of this type would be comparable to the total bolometric luminosity of a ulig such as arp 220 ( figure [ fig3]d ) .",
    "the multiwavelength view of this nearby sample of prototype merging systems suggests caution in deriving scenarios of early evolution of galaxies at high redshift using only observations in the narrow rest - frame ultraviolet wavelength range @xcite .",
    "although the actual numbers of this type of systems may not be large , we must keep in mind that the most intense starbursts are enshrouded in dust and no ultraviolet light leaks out from these regions .",

    "whereas the gas associated to the spiral rotates with a maximum radial velocity of 250 km s@xmath35 , the ellipsoidal stellar component rotates slowly approximately perpendicular to the dust lane @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron radio jets shown in this figure correspond to the inner structure of a double lobe radio source that extends up to 5@xmath36 ( @xmath1 300 kpc ) on the sky .",
    "the jets are believed to be powered by a massive black hole located at the common dynamic center of the elliptical and spiral structures . ]",
    "giant radio galaxies are thought to be massive ellipticals powered by accretion of interstellar matter onto a supermassive black hole .",
    "interactions with gas rich galaxies may provide the interstellar matter to feed the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . to power radio lobes that extend up to distances of hundreds of kiloparsecs , gas has to be funneled from kiloparsec size scales down to the agn at rates of @xmath11 m@xmath33 yr@xmath35 during @xmath3710@xmath38 years .",
    "therefore , large and massive quasi - stable structures of gas and dust should exist in the deep interior of the giant elliptical hosts of double lobe radio galaxies .",
    "recent mid - infrared observations with iso revealed for the first time a bisymmetric spiral structure with the dimensions of a small galaxy at the centre of centaurus a @xcite .",
    "the spiral was formed out of the tidal debris of accreted gas - rich object(s ) and has a dust morphology that is remarkably similar to that found in barred spiral galaxies ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the observations of the closest agn to earth suggest that the dusty hosts of giant radio galaxies like cena , are  symbiotic \" galaxies composed of a barred spiral inside an elliptical , where the bar serves to funnel gas toward the agn .",
    "the barred spiral at the centre of cena has dimensions comparable to that of the small local group galaxy messier 33 .",
    "it lies on a plane that is almost parallel to the minor axis of the giant elliptical .",
    "whereas the spiral rotates with maximum radial velocities of @xmath1250 km s@xmath35 , the ellipsoidal stellar component seems to rotate slowly ( maximum line - of - sight velocity is @xmath140 km s@xmath35 ) approximately perpendicular to the dust lane .",
    "the genesis , morphology , and dynamics of the spiral formed at the centre of cena are determined by the gravitational potential of the elliptical , much as a usual spiral with its dark matter halo . on the other hand ,",
    "the agn that powers the radio jets is fed by gas funneled to the center via the bar structure of the spiral .",
    "the spatial co - existence and intimate association between these two distinct and dissimilar systems suggest that cen a is the result from a cosmic symbiosis .",
    "in disk - disk collisions of galaxies , dynamical friction and subsequent relaxation may produce a mass distribution similar to that in classic elliptical galaxies . from the relative numbers of mergers and ellipticals in the new general catalogue @xcite estimated that a large fraction of ellipticals could be formed via merging .",
    "the first direct observational evidence for the transition from a disk - disk merger toward an elliptical was presented in the optical study of ngc7252 by @xcite .",
    "the brightness distribution over most of the main body of this galaxy which is shown in figure [ fig3]c is closely approximated by a de vacouleurs ( @xmath39 ) profile .",
    "however , ngc7252 still contains large amounts of interstellar gas and exhibits a pair of prominent tidal tails ( see figure [ fig3]b ) ; neither property is typical of ellipticals .",
    "near - infrared images are less affected by dust extinction and also provide a better probe of the older stellar population , which contains most of the disk mass and therefore determines the gravitational potential .",
