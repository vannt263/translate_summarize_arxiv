    "observations of stars in the solar neighbourhood show an increase of the velocity dispersion ( the random motion ) proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the stellar age ( wielen 1977 ; holmberg , nordstrm & andersen 2007 ) .",
    "this effect can be interpreted as a heating of the galactic disc with time .",
    "however , it is unclear what is the cause of this heating .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed : massive black holes in the galactic halo as a source of heating were investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , but seem to be excluded by observations . @xcite considered massive clumps of dark matter as a possible heating agent .",
    "giant molecular clouds were found to cause mostly vertical heating by @xcite and later @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that transient spiral waves heat efficiently in the galactic plane .",
    "lastly , @xcite and @xcite simulate merging with small satellites and find both radial and vertical heating .",
    "this last mechanism is discussed in this paper .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that radial mixing may influence the age - velocity dispersion relation significantly ( schnrich & binney 2009 ; sellwood & binney 2001 ; rokar et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the merging of galaxies can be divided into three categories according to their mass ratios .",
    "major mergers with mass ratios 1:1 to 1:3 of the total galaxy masses usually destroy discs and result in an early type remnant ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "minor mergers with mass ratios 1:3 to 1:10 of the total galaxy masses destroy a thin disc @xcite .",
    "the minor merger events are discussed in the context of the formation of thick discs @xcite and substructure in the halo @xcite .",
    "the third category is the merging of satellite galaxies ( or dark matter clumps ) with smaller mass ratios .",
    "these merger or interaction events can be characterized as a perturbation of the primary galaxy and it is more convenient to quantify the mass ratio in units of the disc mass of the primary . in this context",
    "the survival of a thin disc over 10 gyr in a @xmath2 universe lead to serious constraints on the clumpiness of the dm halo @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared the efficiency of the disc by satellite galaxy mergers of different authors and argued that it scales with the square of the satellite mass .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation heating by dynamical friction during each disc crossing event . as a consequence ,",
    "the upper mass end of the perturbers are most efficient and determine the survival of a thin disc .",
    "kazantzidis et al . ( 2008 , 2009 ) performed a comprehensive study of the impact of dm subhaloes on a milky way like disc galaxy in a realistic cosmological context .",
    "they investigated the resulting substructures and kinematic features in disc and halo .    in numerical simulations",
    "the long - term ( or secular ) dynamical evolution of a thin galactic disc is very sensitive to the spatial resolution , the level of numerical noise , and the dynamical feedback with the dm halo .",
    "a live dark matter halo is important for two reasons . @xcite",
    "have shown that the reaction of the disc on the perturbation of a satellite galaxy is significantly higher with a live halo compared to a rigid dark matter potential .",
    "secondly , dynamical friction in the dark matter is important for the orbital evolution and thus energy loss of satellites with masses exceeding @xmath3 .",
    "this is exactly the mass range dominating the heating rate of the disc by satellite galaxies .",
    "additionally , the mass of the dark matter particle must not be too large in order to avoid numerical heating of the disc . in most simulations the disc is represented by less than 1 million particles leading to a significant thickening of the disc by numerical two - body relaxation , which is much stronger in direct @xmath4-body codes and tree codes compared to particle mesh - codes . in @xcite and in @xcite the numerical heating of the unperturbed disc was shown explicitly .",
    "@xcite used a differential method to quantify the dynamical heating of infalling satellites .",
    "this may underestimate the heating rate , since a more realistic thinner , dynamically cooler , disc is more sensitive to perturbations . on the other hand , the feedback on the satellite galaxy may be larger by the stronger disc shocking event .",
    "particle - mesh codes are predestined for the simulation of collisionless systems such as galaxies , because two - body relaxation is strongly suppressed by the partial decoupling of the point - like structure in orbital motion of the particles and the gravitational potential based on the grid . @xcite",
    "have shown that the growth of global mode perturbations are easily damped out by noise due to an insufficient particle number .",
    "if the excitation of spiral structure or bar - like perturbations are an important mechanism for the energy transfer from the satellite to the disc , then a very high resolution well above 1 million particles is needed to reproduce a realistic heating rate .",
    "improving the resolution of discs in vertical direction has always been a challenge .",
    "there is , indeed , a further problem which is inherent in any numerical technique that is used for the simulation of disc galaxies .",
    "stellar discs have relaxation times larger than a hubble time , i.e. they are collisionless systems .",
    "this implies that in simulations the thickness of an unperturbed disc indicates how well the code would model a collisionless gravitating system .",
    "the term `` unperturbed '' denotes the absence of perturbations such as stellar bars , spiral arms , or molecular clouds .",
    "one often notes , in simulations , that discs become thicker with time .",
    "this is caused by the graininess of the particle distribution and the limited spatial resolution .",
    "we refer to this effect as `` numerical heating '' .    for two decades superbox",
    "is used as a successful tool to simulate the dynamics of isolated and interacting galaxies .",
    "a first description was given by bien , fuchs & wielen ( 1991 ) , together with a consideration of the direct @xmath4-body technique and a tree - code .",
    "for a more detailed discussion the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "we also mention fellhauer s lecture notes @xcite .",
    "the code was evolving from the conventional particle - mesh technique ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by applying grids and sub - grids in regions of high particle density .",
    "the advantage of superbox is that the code can run on any workstation or pc , giving reliable results .",
    "the code thus proves to be a serious alternative to direct @xmath4-body schemes and tree - codes .",
    "initially , @xcite applied superbox to compare numerical experiments to observations of the high - velocity encounter of ngc 4782/4783 .",
    "they found a convincing description of the morphological and kinematical structure , and estimated the time elapsed since the closest approach of the two interacting galaxies .",
    "this was the beginning of a series of research projects using superbox as a tool .",
    "we note as examples the dynamical evolution of a satellite galaxy @xcite , the decay of dwarf galaxies in dark matter haloes @xcite , and dynamical friction , compare @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that @xcite studied the inspiral of a black hole to the galactic centre , and @xcite considered unstable modes in a disc . @xcite",
    "published on the dynamics of the bootes dwarf galaxy .",
    "@xcite investigated the tidal evolution of dwarfs of the local group .",
    "most recently , a study was made on the dynamical friction of massive objects in galactic centres by @xcite .",
    "our list is by far not complete .",
    "so far , superbox was not able to adapt the sub - grids to discs",
    ". a higher resolution in vertical direction can be achieved by introducing flattened grids , see @xcite .",
    "this new feature and the application to dynamical heating of galactic discs are the main topics of the present paper .",
    "the improved code is called superbox-10 . as superbox ,",
    "superbox-10 is rather free of numerical heating .     ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=276 ]     below we first describe superbox in detail and then extend to superbox-10 .",
    "it follows a discussion of the parallelised version which results in a significant speed - up .",
    "then our test of improved vertical resolution is described . as an important application we consider disc heating by satellite galaxies .",
    "in particular , we address the ratio of radial and vertical velocity dispersion and the transfer of energy and angular momentum .",
    "special attention is given to the interaction of the infalling satellite with the dark matter halo .",
    "in a conference proceedings publication @xcite we presented preliminary results on an improved version of superbox with increased vertical resolution of the disc : negligible disc thickening of an isolated disc after 2.5 gyr .",
    "the present paper should be seen as a pilot study for high resolution simulations of disc heating by satellite galaxy mergers .",
    "two new aspects are presented : ( 1 ) no correction for numerical heating is needed and we can measure the heating rate directly .",
    "dynamical friction in the dark matter halo is included automatically .",
    "( 2 ) we analyse for the first time additionally the transfer of angular momentum .",
    "this is important for understanding the physical processes responsible for the disc heating . for this pilot study",
    "we select a satellite with a relatively high mass on eccentric orbits , which is destroyed after a few disc crossing events .",
    "the conventional particle - mesh technique considers a set of massive particles , often called `` superstars '' , in a three - dimensional cartesian grid ( `` box '' ) consisting of @xmath7 cells which represents a relevant part of the universe . in this section ,",
    "the length of each cell is the unity .",
    "we suppose that @xmath8 is the mean density in the cell with indices @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 which are integers running from 0 to @xmath12 . then the potential can be obtained by solving poisson s equation @xmath13 here , @xmath14",

    "the evaluation of all @xmath7 values @xmath20 takes a time proportional to the number of cells squared , @xmath21 .",

    "first @xmath8 and @xmath22 are transformed , resulting in @xmath23\\ ] ] and @xmath24 , analogously .",
    "the potential is then obtained by the inverse transformation of the product @xmath25 , @xmath26   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the procedure can dramatically be accelerated when a fast fourier transform ( fft ) is applied .",
    "the computing time is then roughly proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "the potential , as derived so far by fourier transforms , is correct for periodic systems only .",
    "the exact potential of isolated systems can be obtained by doubling the number of cells in each coordinate direction , i.e. a grid is considered which contains @xmath28 cells .",
    "a rigorous proof can be found in the paper by @xcite . as before , the @xmath7 sub - grid contains the particles ( `` active region '' ) .",
    "the remaining space is left empty .",
    "likewise , @xmath29 is extended over the @xmath28 cells such that it satisfies @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "having transformed the extended functions @xmath32 and @xmath29 , the correct potential @xmath33 can be found in the active grid .",
    "outside , @xmath33 is unphysical",
    ".    numerical differentiation of the potential with respect to the coordinates leads for each particle @xmath34 to the acceleration @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the leap - frog scheme is applied to integrate the equations of motions . in @xmath38-direction",
    "the algorithm reads @xmath39 where @xmath1 is the time and @xmath40 denotes the constant integration step .",
    "the particle - mesh technique holds some subtle twists .",
    "for instance for @xmath22 it suffices a @xmath41 grid . from the symmetry conditions ( [ eq : symmetry ] )",
    "follows that the function is then known on the whole @xmath28 grid .",
    "the sub - grid is overwritten by @xmath42 which shows similar symmetries .",
    "@xmath42 is calculated only once , since it is fixed over the integration period . for each integration step the grid containing the density @xmath32 is overwritten by the fourier",
    "transform @xmath43 which , in turn , is overwritten by @xmath44 ) .",
    "this product is finally overwritten by @xmath33 .",
    "the advantages of the method are obvious .",
    "the conventional particle - mesh technique was orders of magnitude faster than direct @xmath4-body codes at the time .",
    "this allows the integration of a large number of particles .",
    "thus , statistical noise is extremely low .",
    "particles leaving the outermost grid are lost .",
    "the user should thus carefully consider the number of particles involved in the computation .    the greatest disadvantage , however , is the low spatial resolution in regions of higher particle densities , e.g. the cores of spherical galaxies .",
    "an improvement is superbox which treats the particles self - consistently in a nested system of grids . here",
    ", the term `` self - consistent '' means that all particles have masses which define the total potential . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a spherical galaxy of radius @xmath5 .",
    "fig . 1 shows how the particles are subdivided into a central region ( `` core '' ) where the distance @xmath45 from the centre is @xmath46 and a region with @xmath47 . the local universe.is given by @xmath6 .    as shown in fig .",
    "2 superbox utilises five grids .",

    "this is done by centreing the inner and intermediate grids on the density maximum of the galaxy in question .",
    "alternatively , the centre of mass can be considered .",
    "particles outside @xmath6 are lost , compare the discussion above .",
    "the code is not restricted to one galaxy . since the potentials , and thus the accelerations , are additive , all galaxies are treated sequentially in the same five grids .",

    "then its acceleration , e.g. in @xmath38-direction is found by the expression @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the length of the cell .",
    "this scheme requires two empty cells at each boundary , i. e. , only @xmath68 cells per dimension are considered .",
    "we note that in superbox , the three lengths are equal . when all velocities are updated by applying these accelerations , then new positions of the particles are calculated .",
    "after that , a new integration cycle starts .      for version 10 , superbox s",

    "`` satellite '' designates those particles that once made up the satellite , but now are distributed over the whole system .",
    "the initial galaxy - satellite system is not in equilibrium . as a consequence of virialisation , both the satellite and the halo gain kinetic and lose potential energy .",
    "this results in a deeper potential well in the centre , which reduces the potential energy of bulge and disc . during its in - spiral , the satellite transfers part of its kinetic energy to the halo particles .",
    "this is due to dynamical friction .    .",
    "the change is measured in units of the total angular momentum of the isolated galaxy .",
    "only the data for @xmath88 is shown.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    this effect can also be seen in figure  [ fig : angmom - transf ] , which shows the change in angular momentum as a function of inclination , measured in units of the total angular momentum of the isolated galaxy . the angular momentum of the bulge barely changes .",
    "this is not surprising since the satellites are already mostly destroyed before reaching the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "our data reveal that the radial distribution of angular momentum in the disc changes : the disc slows down and expands .",
    "its _ total _ angular momentum , however , remains approximately nearly constant .",
    "it only increases slightly for satellites on prograde orbits and decreases slightly for satellites on retrograde orbits .",
    "the satellite s initial orbital angular momentum is @xmath143 in these units .",
    "accordingly , it loses between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of its angular momentum . of that , about 80 per cent goes into the halo , while the rest is imparted onto the disc .      to ensure that the choice of resolution does not influence the results we simulate a case with @xmath88 and @xmath144 , and higher resolution .",
    "we choose @xmath145 and @xmath146 , as this is the highest possible resolution one can achieve on our present hardware .",
    "we calculate the fourier transform of the density distribution of the disc at the end of the simulation in order to find possible perturbations caused by low resolution .",
    "the @xmath147th complex fourier coefficient is given by    @xmath148    where @xmath116 and @xmath149 are the central radius and area of the @xmath85th bin ,",
    "the index @xmath34 runs over all particles in bin @xmath85 , and @xmath150 and @xmath151 are the mass and polar angle of the @xmath34th particle .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath152 is denoted by @xmath153 and the phase by @xmath154 .",
    "figure  [ fig : modes ] shows the amplitudes of the first and second mode normalised by the mean density , while figure  [ fig : phases ] displays the phase of the first mode .",
    "the two resolutions result in a roughly similar distribution in fourier space .",
    "there are no strong perturbations in amplitude caused by the lower resolution .",
    "neither is the pattern speed affected significantly .",
    "superbox is a particle - mesh code where additional grids and sub - grids are applied to regions of high particle density .",
    "this strategy turns out to be very efficient since the code can run on any workstation or pc .",
    "nevertheless , the code has its limitations .",
    "for instance , stellar discs are poorly resolved in vertical direction .",
    "we overcome this problem by introducing flattened grids .",
    "this is one of the features of the new code superbox-10 where , in addition , an individual mass can be assigned to each particles .",
    "we found that the computationally most intensive part of the code is the fft .",
    "we parallelised it using the library fftw .",
    "this resulted in a speed - up of 2 to 24 , depending on grid size @xmath4 and the number of particles @xmath82 .",
    "we created a galaxy model with an exponential disc , a bulge with a hernquist profile and a dark matter halo , also with a hernquist profile .",
    "the model was realised using the program magalie .",
    "the model was first simulated in isolation .",
    "these simulations show that flattening the intermediate grid is an efficient means to reduce numerical heating in the simulation .",
    "we also simulated the merging of the galaxy with small satellites in order to analyse the proposed disc heating due to the interaction .",
    "we find that satellites on prograde orbits with low eccentricity and inclination heat the disc most efficiently .",
    "if the heat increase in the solar neighbourhood were to be explained by that type of satellite mergers alone , a rate between 0.2 and 1.7 mergers per gyr would be required .",
    "the detailed analysis of energy and angular momentum re - distribution shows that most of the satellites energy and angular momentum is transfered to the dark matter halo .",
    "this shows that the halo plays an important role even in 50:1 mergers .",
    "this confirms , that simulations of such processes should represent the halo by live particles and not by a fixed background potential .",
    "the presented pilot study of high - resolution simulations of disc heating by merging satellite galaxies serves as a starting point for an extended parameter study to quantify the heating rate in a cosmological context .",
