    "let @xmath2 be a stationary sequence of random variables , and let @xmath3 , @xmath4 be the sequence of its partial maxima .",
    "the limiting distributional behavior of the latter sequence is one of the major topics of interest in extreme value theory .",
    "we are particularly interested in the possible limits in a functional limit theorem of the form @xmath5 for properly chosen sequences @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the weak convergence in ( [ efunctconv ] ) is typically in the space @xmath8 with one of the usual skorohod topologies on that space ; see @xcite and @xcite . if the original sequence @xmath2 is an i.i.d .",
    "sequence , then the only possible limit in  ( [ efunctconv ] ) is _ the extremal process _ , the extreme value analog of the lvy process ; see @xcite .",
    "the modern extreme value theory is interested in the case when the sequence @xmath2 is stationary , but not necessarily independent .",
    "the potential clustering of the extremes in this case leads one to expect that new limits may arise in  ( [ efunctconv ] )",
    ". such new limits , however , have not been widely observed , and the dependence in the model has been typically found to be reflected in the limit via a linear time change ( a slowdown ) , often connected to the _ extremal index _ , introduced originally in @xcite .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , as well as the studies in @xcite and @xcite . one possible explanation for this is the known phenomenon that the operation of taking partial maxima tends to mitigate the effect of dependence in the original stationary sequence , and the dependent models considered above were , in a certain sense , not sufficiently strongly dependent .",
    "starting with a long range dependent sequence may make a difference , as was demonstrated by @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "the original sequence was ( the absolute value of ) a stationary symmetric @xmath9-stable process , @xmath10 , and the length of memory was quantified by a single parameter @xmath1 . in the case",
    "@xmath11 , it was shown that the limiting process in ( [ efunctconv ] ) can be represented in the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the extremal ( @xmath9-)frchet process .",
    "the nonlinear power time change in  ( [ elimprocess ] ) is both surprising and misleadingly simple .",
    "it is surprising because it is not immediately clear that such a change is compatible with a certain translation invariance the limiting process must have due to the stationarity of the original sequence .",
    "it is misleadingly simple because it hides a much more delicate structure .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to reveal that structure .",
    "we start by explaining exactly what we are looking for .    the stochastic processes in the left - hand side of ( [ efunctconv ] )",
    "can be easily interpreted as _ random sup measures _ evaluated on a particular family of sets ( those of the form @xmath14 $ ] for @xmath15 ) . if one does not restrict himself to that specific family of sets and , instead , looks at all borel subsets of @xmath16 , then it is possible to ask whether there is weak convergence in the appropriately defined space of random sup measures , and what might be the limiting random sup measures .",
    "see the discussion around  ( [ epartialmn ] ) and the convergence result in theorem  [ textendos ] .",
    "this is the approach taken in  @xcite . completing the work published in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide a detailed description of the possible limits .",
    "they show that the limiting random sup measure must be _ self - affine _ ( they refer to random sup measures as extremal processes , but we reserve this name for a different object ) .",
    "as we will see in the sequel , if  ( [ efunctconv ] ) can be stated in terms of weak convergence of a sequence of random sup measures , this would imply the finite - dimensional convergence part in the functional formulation of  ( [ efunctconv ] ) .",
    "therefore , any limiting process @xmath17 that can be obtained as a limit in this case must be equal in distribution to the restriction of a random sup measure to the sets of the form @xmath14 $ ] , @xmath15 .",
    "the convergence to the process @xmath18 established in @xcite was not established in the sense of weak convergence of a sequence of random sup measures , and one of our tasks in this paper is to fill this gap and prove the above convergence .",
    "recall , however , that the convergence in @xcite was established only for @xmath10 ( by necessity , since @xmath9-stable processes do not exist outside of this range ) and @xmath11 .",
    "the nonlinear time change in ( [ elimprocess ] ) is , however , well defined for all @xmath19 and @xmath1 , and leads to a process @xmath18 that is self - similar and has stationary max - increments .",
    "our second task in this paper is to prove that the process @xmath18 can , for _ all values of its parameters _ , be extended to a random sup measure and elucidate the structure of the resulting random sup measure .",
    "the key result is corollary  [ cmainresult ] below .",
    "the structure we obtain is of interest on its own right .",
    "it is constructed based on a certain random closed set possessing appropriate scaling and translation invariance properties .",
    "extending this approach to other random sets and other ways of handling these random sets may potentially lead to a construction of new classes of self - similar processes with stationary max - increments and of random sup measures .",
    "this is important both theoretically , and may be useful in applications .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will define precisely the notions discussed somewhat informally above and introduce the required technical background .",
    "section  [ secergodic ] contains a discussion of the dynamics of the stationary sequence considered in this paper .",
    "it is based on a null recurrent markov chain . in section  [ secsupmeasure ]",
    ", we will prove that the process @xmath20 can be extended to a random sup measure and construct explicitly such an extension . in section  [ secconvergence ]",
    ", we show that the convergence result of @xcite holds , in a special case of a markovian ergodic system , also in the space sm of sup measures",
    ". finally , in section  [ secotherpr ] we present one of the possible extensions of the present work .",
    "an extremal process @xmath21 can be viewed as an analog of a lvy motion when the operation of summation is replaced by the operation of taking the maximum .",
    "the one - dimensional marginal distribution of a lvy process at time 1 can be an arbitrary infinitely divisible distribution on @xmath22 ; _ any _ one - dimensional distribution is infinitely divisible with respect to the operation of taking the maximum .",
    "hence the one - dimensional marginal distribution of an extremal process at time 1 can be any distribution on @xmath16 ; the restriction to the nonnegative half - line being necessitated by the fact that , by convention , an extremal process , analogously to a lvy process , starts at the origin at time zero . if @xmath23 is the c.d.f . of a probability distribution on @xmath16 ,",

    "a stochastic process @xmath42 is said to have stationary max - increments if for every @xmath43 , there exists , perhaps on an enlarged probability space , a stochastic process @xmath44 such that @xmath45 with @xmath46 ; see @xcite .",
    "this notion is an analog of the usual notion of a process with stationary increments ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) suitable for the situation where the operation of summation is replaced by the operation of taking the maximum .",
    "it follows from theorem 3.2 in @xcite that only self - similar processes with stationary max - increments can be obtained as limits in the functional convergence scheme  ( [ efunctconv ] ) with @xmath47 .",

    "the convergence scheme  ( [ efunctconv ] ) has a natural version in terms of random sup measures . starting with a stationary sequence @xmath69 of nonnegative random variables , one can define for any set @xmath70 @xmath71 then for any @xmath72 , @xmath73 is a random sup measure , and @xcite characterizes all possible limiting random sup measures in a statement of the form @xmath74 for some sequence @xmath6 .",
    "the convergence is weak convergence in the space sm equipped with the sup vague topology .",
    "theorem 6.1 in @xcite shows that any limiting random sup measure @xmath75 must be both stationary and self - similar , that is , @xmath76 for some exponent @xmath39 of self - similarity .",

    "we do show that the process @xmath18 in ( [ elimprocess ] ) has such an extension .",
