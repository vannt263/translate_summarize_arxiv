    "modern calculations @xcite based on relativistic equations of state indicate that the neutron star cores consist of neutrons with the admixture of protons , electrons , muons and some exotic particles ( including hyperons , k - mesons , quarks and so on  ) .",
    "the composition is governed by the charge neutrality and equilibrium of the medium under weak processes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are baryons ( or quarks ) , and @xmath5 is a lepton , either an electron or a muon .",
    "these reactions , widely known as the direct urca processes , are a central point of any modern scenarios of evolution of neutron stars .",
    "neutrino energy losses caused by the direct urca processes lead to a rapid cooling of degenerate neutron star cores @xcite .",
    "the corresponding reactions on nucleons , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , are the most powerful sources of neutrinos and antineutrinos in cooling neutron stars . in spite of",
    "widely adopted importance of these reactions , the corresponding neutrino energy losses are not well investigated yet . a simple formula suggested by lattimer et al .",
    "@xcite more than ten years ago has been derived in a non - relativistic manner .",
    "actually , however , the superthreshold proton fraction , necessary for the direct urca processes to operate in the degenerate nuclear matter , appears at large densities , where the fermi momenta of participating nucleons are comparable with their effective mass .",
    "moreover , according to modern numerical simulations , the central density of the star can be up to eight times larger than the nuclear saturation density @xcite .",
    "this implies a substantially relativistic motion of nucleons in the superdense neutron star core .",
    "the appropriate equation of state for such a matter is actually derived in the relativistic approach , and the relevant neutrino energy losses must be consistent with the used relativistic equation of state .",
    "some aspects of this problem was studied by leinson and prez @xcite , who have estimated relativistic effects of baryon recoil and parity violation in the direct urca processes including also effects of the baryon mass difference .",
    "this approach is useful , for example , for the direct urca reactions changing the baryon strangeness because , in this case , the contribution of the weak magnetism into the matrix element of the beta - decay is not well known even for free particles . for nucleons , the relativistic regime should incorporate the effects of weak magnetism and pseudoscalar interaction , which drastically influence the neutrino emissivity of the corresponding reactions . to demonstrate this , in the present paper we consider the totally relativistic direct urca process on nucleons .",
    "we utilize the walecka - type relativistic model of baryon matter @xcite , where the baryons interact via exchange of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 mesons , and perform the calculation of the neutrino energy losses in the mean field approximation .",
    "this approximation is widely used in the theory of relativistic nuclear matter , and allows to calculate in a self - consistent way the composition of the matter together with energies , and effective masses of the baryons . in section",
    "ii we begin with considering the relativistic kinematics of the neutron beta decay in the medium under beta equilibrium .",
    "we consider a free gas model and some field theoretical models of nuclear matter to demonstrate that the direct neutron decay in neutron stars is open only due to strong interactions caused by isovector mesons .",
    "we shortly discuss the energies and the wave functions of nucleons in the mean field approximation and demonstrate the nonconservation of the charged vector current of nucleons in this model .",

    "iv we calculate the neutrino energy losses caused by the direct urca on nucleons in the degenerate nuclear matter under chemical and thermal equilibrium . in section",
    "v we inspect the non - relativistic limit of the neutrino energy losses in order to compare this with the expressions earlier obtained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "efficiency of the relativistic approach is numerically studied in section vi .",
    "we evaluate the neutrino energy losses due to the direct urca processes on nucleons in the multicomponent baryon matter under beta equilibrium and compare the relativistic result with that predicted by the known non - relativistic formula .",
    "we specially discuss the contributions of weak magnetism and pseudoscalar interaction .",
    "summary and conclusion are in section vii . in appendix , we discuss some details of the model used for the nuclear matter .    in what follows",
    "we use the system of units @xmath11 and the boltzmann constant @xmath12 .",
    "summation over repeated greek indexes is assumed",
    "before calculating the neutrino energy losses caused by the direct urca processes , let us examine relativistic kinematics of the reaction , @xmath13 , in the degenerate matter under beta equilibrium . in what follows we consider massless neutrinos of energy and momentum @xmath14 with @xmath15 the energy - momentum of the final lepton @xmath16 of mass @xmath17",

    "thus , the energy and momentum conservation in the beta decay is given by the following equations@xmath20where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the in - medium energies of the neutron and the proton respectively .",
    "the energy exchange in the matter goes naturally on the temperature scale @xmath23 , which is small compared to typical kinetic energies of degenerate particles",
    ". therefore the momenta of in - medium fermions can be fixed at their values at fermi surfaces , which we denote as @xmath24 , @xmath25 for the nucleons and @xmath26 for leptons respectively .",
    "since the antineutrino energy is @xmath27 , and the antineutrino momentum @xmath28 is much smaller than the momenta of other particles , we can neglect the neutrino contributions in eqs .",
    "( [ cons ] ) . then the momentum conservation , @xmath29 , implies the well known  triangle ",
    "condition , @xmath30necessary for the urca processes to operate .",
    "however , the momentum conservation is necessary but insufficient condition for the direct beta decay to occur .",
    "the energy conservation requires a one more condition@xmath31squaring of both sides of this equation gives@xmath32if we denote the energy - momentum transfer from the nucleon as @xmath33 the eq .",
    "( [ ec ] ) can be readily recognized as @xmath34 .",
    "this condition naturally arises from the time - like momentum of the final lepton pair , @xmath35 , and can be satisfied only in the presence of the energy gap between spectrums of protons and neutrons .",
    "consider now the condition of beta equilibrium , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the chemical potentials of neutrons , protons , and leptons respectively .",

    "] this equation is not the same as eq .",
    "( econs ) . however , if the  triangle  condition ( [ triangle ] ) is fulfilled then the direct neutron decay is open , and one has @xmath42 . in this case",
    "( [ chem ] ) becomes identical to the energy consrvation ( [ econs ] ) .",
    "thus under beta equilibrium , the  triangle ",
    "condition is the necessary and sufficient for the direct neutron decay to occur .",
    "it should be emphasized however that the stated conditions are consistent only in the presence of the energy gap between protons and neutrons .",
    "therefore the possibility of the direct neutron decay depends substantially on the model of nuclear matter .",
    "consider , for example , a degenerate free gas consisting of neutrons , protons , and electrons under beta equilibrium . in this case",
    "the energy gap exists only due to the mass difference of a neutron and a proton .",
    "if we denote the masses as @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively , then the corresponding fermi energies are @xmath45 @xmath46 , and @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "due to charge neutrality the number density of electrons , @xmath49 , equals to the number density of protons , @xmath50 .",
    "this implies @xmath51 and the equation of chemical equilibrium ( [ chem ] ) becomes of the form@xmath52solution of this equation @xmath53@xmath54 gives the proton fermi momentum as a function of the neutron fermi momentum in the beta - equilibrated gas of protons and neutrons . as required by the  triangle ",
    "condition , @xmath55 , the direct neutron decay in such a medium is open when @xmath25 is larger than @xmath56 .",
    "so , solution of the equation@xmath57@xmath54gives the critical value of the neutron fermi momentum above which the direct neutron decay is forbidden .",
    "we find @xmath58thus the direct neutron decay is forbidden if the number density of neutrons is larger than @xmath59this number density is much smaller than that typical for neutron star cores , therefore the direct neutron decay in the cooling neutron stars can occur only due to strong interactions .",
    "notice , some of models of strong interaction also forbid the direct neutron decay .",
    "consider , for example , a simple model for the baryon matter wa74 , which contains fields for baryons and neutral scalar @xmath60 and vector @xmath61 mesons .",
    "this model reproduces in a simple way the empirical nn scattering amplitude and the bulk nuclear properties .",
    "however , the neutral scalar and vector mesons equally interact with protons and neutrons , which therefore have identical energy spectrums . in this case , the energy and momentum in the direct neutron decay can not be conserved simultaneously .     to allow the direct neutron decay ,",
    "the model of nuclear matter must be generalized to include some additional degrees of freedom and couplings , which are able to create a large energy gap between possible energies of the proton and neutron . for this purpose , besides isoscalar mesons @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the model should include also isovector mesons .",
    "the isovector meson couples differently to protons and neutrons , thus creating the energy gap necessary for the direct neutron decay .      in the following we consider a self - consistent relativistic model of nuclear matter in which baryons interact via exchange of isoscalar mesons @xmath8 and @xmath9 and an isovector meson @xmath10 ( see appendix ) . in the mean field approximation ,",
    "when the contribution of mesons reduce to classical condensate fields @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , only the baryon fields must be quantized .",
    "this procedure yields the following linear dirac equation for the nucleon @xmath65here and below we denote as @xmath66 , and @xmath67 the components of isospin operator , which act on the isobaric doublet @xmath68 of nucleon field ; @xmath69 is the bare nucleon mass .",
    "the stationary and uniform condensate fields equally shift the effective masses @xmath70but lead to different potential energies of the proton and neutron @xmath71thus creating the energy gap @xmath72 between possible energies of protons and neutrons .    the exact solutions of eq .",
    "( [ diraceq ] ) can be found separately for protons and for neutrons . in our case of a stationary , uniform system , solution for the neutron",
