    "to search for candidate comoving , wide - separation companions to t  cha , we made use of the vizier table browsing and source matching utilities available in topcat .",
    "we first compiled a list of all 2mass sources within @xmath11 of t  cha that have @xmath12 magnitudes and @xmath13 colors within the range expected for low - mass ( late k or m - type ) stars within @xmath9 pc , i.e. , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we then used the ucac3 @xcite proper motion catalog to select the subset of these 2mass sources whose measured proper motions ( pms ) lie within @xmath1615 mas yr@xmath17 of each of the pm components of t  cha .",

    "more specifically , the large @xmath296708 li i ew we measure in the spectrum of 2m115579 is comparable to those of mid - m stars in the @xmath28 myr - old tw hya association @xcite and the @xmath27 myr - old @xmath1 cha group ( even though 2m115579 is among the lowest - mass @xmath1 cha members known ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , its li absorption line ew is a factor at least @xmath23 larger than those of m stars ( of all spectral subtype ) in the @xmath212 myr - old @xmath30 pic moving group @xcite .",
    "hence its li absorption line strength alone places an upper limit of @xmath210 myr on the age of 2m115579 .    adopting the data and methods in @xcite ,",
    "the 2mass magnitudes and m3 spectral type of 2m1155@xmath379 suggest an effective temperature of 3400@xmath16100 k ( where the error corresponds to an uncertainty of one spectral subclass ) and  assuming 2m115579 , like t  cha , lies at @xmath7 pc @xcite but , unlike t  cha , suffers negligible reddening ( given its low @xmath31 ; see below )  a bolometric luminosity @xmath32 .",
    "the pre - ms evolutionary tracks of , which are appropriate given the age and mass range of interest here ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then indicate an age @xmath210 myr and mass just under @xmath20.3 @xmath33 ( fig  [ fig : hrdiagram ] ) .",
    "the former is consistent with the upper limit on the age of 2m115579 imposed by its strong li absorption . in light of their similar proper motions and",
    "the fact that ( adopting @xmath7 pc ) the two stars fall near the same ( age 10 myr ) theoretical isochone in fig  [ fig : hrdiagram ]  an isochrone that is , in turn , very similar to the estimated ( 7 myr ) age of the @xmath1 cha group with which t cha is kinematically associated ( * ? ? ? * and references therein )  it appears that t  cha and 2m115579 are equidistant , coeval , and comoving . the latter star is therefore most likely a newly identified member of the @xmath1 cha association .",
    "furthermore , given the low surface density of known members of the @xmath1 cha group ( @xmath34 degree@xmath35 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the poisson probability @xmath36 that t  cha and 2m115579 represent a chance alignment of two ( otherwise unrelated ) @xmath1 cha association stars within the ( @xmath37 degree@xmath38 ) xmm / epic field is vanishingly small ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we therefore assert that these two stars very likely comprise a very wide ( projected separation @xmath238 kau ) binary system ; hence , hereafter , we refer to 2m115579 as t cha b.      the h@xmath25 emission line strength of t  cha displayed in our spectrum ( table  [ tbl : vjhkxmm ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , center ) lies near the middle of the ( wide ) range previously measured for this star , and is only marginally consistent with `` classical '' ( as opposed to weak - lined ) t tauri star status .",
    "the h@xmath25 linewidth at 10% of peak intensity at the time of our observations , @xmath40 475 km s@xmath17 , would place t  cha among the weakly accreting t tauri stars  with an inferred accretion rate of @xmath41 @xmath33 yr@xmath17  given the empirical relationship between @xmath42 and @xmath43 described in .",
    "in contrast , we measure @xmath40 149 km s@xmath17 for t cha b ( fig .

    "the presence of disk gas around t cha a  and the apparent absence of such intervening disk gas , along the line of sight to t cha b  is also evident in the large contrast between their respective x - ray absorbing columns ( table  [ tbl : vjhkxmm ] ) .",

    "the projected separation of the apparent t cha a / b pair , @xmath238 kau , is very similar to that of the tw hya association ( twa ) brown dwarf candidate twa 28 from tw hya itself , and is much larger than the projected separation of v4046 sgr ab and c[d ] ( @xmath212.4 kau ; * ? ? ?",

    "the projected separations of four of these systems ( t cha a and b ; tw hya and twa 28 ; v4046 sgr ab and c[d ] ; and hr 4796 ab and c ) rival or exceed those of the widest known main - sequence binaries in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath220 kau ; * ? ? ?",

    "high resolution spectroscopy and precise proper motion determinations  capable of establishing the relative space motion of the two stars to within @xmath51 kms@xmath17  are required to ascertain whether they are in fact gravitationally bound .",
