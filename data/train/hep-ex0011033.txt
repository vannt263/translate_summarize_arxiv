    "if one looks at current ( or recent ) experiments with charged kaons , quite some with unseparated beams of different energies and intensities can be found , few with very low energy electrostaticly separated beams , but there is no high energy separated beams in operation .",
    "the reason is that the relatively simple electrostatic @xmath1 separation , which is very effective at low energies does not work above few gev and one has to build a high power rf cavities which provide strong oscillating electrical field .",
    "the most popular panofsky - montague - schnell scheme of separation is presented in fig.[fig : rf ] .",
    "the beam with definite momentum is sent to the system of two deflectors with `` -1 '' optics in between .",
    "the phase shift between two deflectors is tuned in such a way that the `` unwanted '' particles ( @xmath2 in fig.[fig : rf ] ) have equal relative phase in both deflectors . as a result ,",
    "they get two deflections which , in presented scheme , compensate each other and are absorbed in the beam stopper .",
    "the distance between the deflectors is selected in such a way that kaons , because of longer time - of - flight , have @xmath3 shift with respect to pions , get double deflection and avoid the absorber(it is interesting to note that because of random relation @xmath4 , the protons are suppressed `` for free '' together with pions ) .",
    "+ the rf deflectors must be superconductive to be able to keep the field during slow extraction time of few seconds .",
    "moreover , to get high quality factor of cavities it is necessary to cool them down to the superfluid he temperature of 1.8 k@xmath5 .",
    "all these aspects make the design technologically complicated .",
    "+ at present , there are two projects which aim to build rf - separated high intensity ( slow extracted ) beams : + 1 .",
    "fnal main injector superconducting rf - separated beam for the ckm experiment @xcite .",
    "ihep , protvino u-70 ps superconducting rf - separated beam for the `` oka '' experiment , based on existing karlsruhe - cern superconductive deflectors .",
    "the only existing superconductive rf - separator was built at karlsruhe(frg ) and used at cern sps at the end of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it was an essential part of the s1 beam with @xmath0 , @xmath7 of different energies for the @xmath8-spectrometer .",
    "the parameters of the deflectors are summarized in table  [ table : karl ] .",
    ".the parameters of the cern deflectors . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the advantage of the na48 proposal is in the use of `` simultaneous '' @xmath0 beam , it allows to compensate the false asymmetry caused by the drift of the set - up parameters in time , as well as to have the same trigger conditions for the both beams .",
    "the advantage of the `` oka '' is much lower total intensity of the beam and larger acceptance . + the main difficulty of the proposed experiments is to demonstrate that , indeed , there is no `` dangerous '' systematics at the level of @xmath9 . in case of `` oka '' a possible strategy of the measurements is the change of the polarities of all the beam elements , say , every 6 hours .",
    "it s important then to change the polarity of the main spectrometer magnet at the same time .",
    "the possible sources of the systematics are : + 1 . difference in the hadronic interactions between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    ". different parameters of the positive and the negative beams . in particular , the tilt of the beams with respect to each other is potentially dangerous .",
    "effects of the resolution .",
    "variation of the setup and the beam parameters with time etc .... + we have started the detailed geant mc - studies of the different effects .",

    "the difference in the slopes @xmath14 . ]    the fig .",
    "[ fig : burt1 ] shows the reconstructed @xmath15 mass distribution , the resolution is @xmath16  1.2 mev ; fig .",
    "[ fig : burt3]- the reconstructed z - coordinate of the decay vertex(z -is directed along the beam ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : burt4 ] shows the acceptance of the setup versus z of the decay point .",
    "it is seen that the decay volume length of @xmath16 12 m is kind of optimum . at last ,",
    "[ fig : burt5 ] shows the events distribution over the kinetic energy of the `` odd '' pion in the kaon rest frame for the case of @xmath12 and @xmath13 decays .",
    "the both distributions are normalized to that for the `` even '' pions .",
    "these is the simplest way to remove the phase space dependance . to extract the g - slopes ,",
    "the distributions are fitted with the formulae : @xmath17 the denominator takes into account the `` fake '' slope for the `` even '' pion distribution which is @xmath18 .",
    "the last figure corresponds to the statistics of about 30 m decays .",
    "it is seen that the difference in the slopes due to the difference in hadronic interactions between @xmath10 and @xmath11 is smaller than @xmath19 .",
    "we ll continue these preliminary systematics studies in future , of course .",
    "what is interesting to mention , is that there are several decays , where the @xmath0 asymmetry must be negligible .",
    "for example , in the decay @xmath20 the asymmetry must be very small because there is practically no final state interaction .",
    "the intense decay @xmath21 is another example , here the expected effect is very small ( @xmath22 ) , because the decay goes through one amplitude ( s - wave , @xmath23 ) .",
    "these decays can be used to control the systematics .",
    "the t - invariance is one of the fundamental symmetries in physics .",
    "it is still an open problem to be tested experimentally with high precision .",
    "t - violation must exist , because if cpt - invariance , which is considered by majority of theories as a `` must '' works , it is nothing more than cp - violation which is already well established .",
    "t - invariance has been studied in many experiments .",
    "typical example is searches for the electric dipole moment of elementary particles @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to look for the t - odd correlations in particles decays , such as triple correlations including spin in the neutron decay .",
    "a well known example of the t - odd correlation in the kaon decays is the polarization of the muon normal to the decay plane in @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) decay : @xmath26 it was first suggested by j.j.sakurai to look for t - violation by @xmath27 measurement .",
    "the unique feature of these process is that the `` fake '' t - odd correlation due to the final state interaction ( fsi ) is very small : @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "although the sm predicts zero effect , in some models ( like 3hdm of weinberg @xcite ) a value higher than @xmath19 is predicted .",
    "the best measurement of the @xmath29 , performed about 20 years ago at the bnl - ags @xcite gives : @xmath30 .",
    "current result from kek e246 @xcite is @xmath31 c.l . , they hope to reach @xmath32 at the end of the experiment .",
    "we do not plan at present to measure @xmath27 in the `` oka '' experiment : the energy of 12.5 gev looks too high for that . on the contrary , we are seriously considering the possibility of measuring the triple t - odd correlation : latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : todd } t_{\\pi \\mu \\gamma}=\\frac{\\vec p_{\\gamma } \\cdot ( \\vec p_{\\pi }   \\times \\vec p_{\\mu})}{|\\vec p_{\\gamma}|\\cdot     @xmath33 .",
    "such a measurement was proposed for the first time by j.gevais , j.iliopoulous and j.kaplan in 1966 @xcite .",
    "there are no theoretical predictions for the effect , at present .",
    "the `` fake '' fsi correlation must not be strong : naively it must be similar to @xmath36 in @xmath37 , which is @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath0 beam gives a principle possibility of subtraction of the fsi : the fsi - correlation has the same sign in @xmath0 , while the true effect changes the sign .",
    "+ the decay @xmath39 has not yet been observed , the prediction of the sm is @xmath40 .",
    "the only experimental measurement of the t - odd correlation in the decay @xmath41 is from istra set - up at u-70 @xcite : @xmath42 ( @xmath43mev ; @xmath44 ) .",
    "+ the ihep theorists are performing detailed calculations of the correlation ( [ eq : todd ] ) in sm and in the weinberg s 3hdm @xcite .",
    "this model is known to be a benchmark for the cp violation searches beyond the sm .",
    "there are several parameters in the model relevant for our case : @xmath45- the mass of the lightest charged higgs ; @xmath46 - the vev s of the 3 higgs fields : @xmath47 ; @xmath48 ; i=1,2- 6 complex yukawa coupling constants which are related to each other by the conditions : @xcite @xmath49 @xmath50 further constraints on the model parameters can be extracted from the experimental data on @xmath51- the neutron electrical dipole moment ; @xmath52 ; @xmath53 etc .",
    "given all the constraints , one still can expect a large value for @xmath54 . to illustrate , what one can expect , fig.[fig : ris1 ] shows the t - odd correlation , defined in a bit different way : @xmath55 for the reasonable set of parameters in the 3hdm : @xmath56 gev ; @xmath57 ; @xmath58 ; @xmath59 , which is not excluded by any existing measurement .",
    "a cut of @xmath60 and @xmath61 mev was done in the kaon rest frame to suppress the `` trivial '' ib part of the process .",
    "+ in `` oka '' we can detect on the order of @xmath62 events of the decay @xmath63 , or @xmath64 events after the kinematical cuts , which is quite sufficient to detect the effect of fig .",
