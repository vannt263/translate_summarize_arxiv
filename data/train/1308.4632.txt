    "last year s discovery  @xcite by the atlas and cms collaborations of a higgs - like boson completes the particle content of the standard model .",
    "coupled with the absence to date of direct signals of physics beyond the standard model , the discovery points towards an important role for precision measurements in determining the scale of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "theoretical calculations at the lhc , whether for signals or backgrounds , begin with the tree - level amplitudes required for leading - order ( lo ) calculations in perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "because the strong coupling @xmath4 is relatively large and runs quickly , lo predictions suffer from strong dependence on the unphysical renormalization and factorization scales and are thus not quantitatively reliable .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) is the lowest order in perturbation theory which offers quantitatively reliable predictions .",
    "these calculations require one - loop amplitudes in addition to tree - level amplitudes with higher multiplicity .",
    "recent years have seen major advances in nlo calculations , especially for processes with several jets in the final state  @xcite . while the uncertainty left by scale variation can not be quantified in the same fashion as statistical uncertainties , experience shows that it is of @xmath5(1015% ) .",
    "as combined experimental uncertainties in future measurements push below this level , a comparison with theoretical calculations will require pushing on to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) accuracy .",
    "such studies will require computation of two - loop amplitudes .",
    "these computations form the next frontier of precision qcd calculations",
    ". the only existing fully - exclusive nnlo jet calculations to date are for three - jet production in electron  positron annihilation  @xcite .",
    "these calculations have been used to determine @xmath4 to 1% accuracy from jet data at lep  @xcite .",
    "this extraction is competitive with other determinations . beyond their use in seeking deviations in precision experimental data from standard - model predictions",
    ", nnlo calculations will also be useful at the lhc for improving our understanding of scale stability in multi - scale processes such as @xmath6+multi - jet production , as well as for providing honest theoretical uncertainty estimates for nlo calculations .",
    "the unitarity method  @xcite has made many previously - inaccessible one - loop calculations feasible .",
    "of particular note are processes with many partons in the final state .",
    "the most recent development , applying generalized unitarity , allows the method to be applied either analytically or purely numerically  @xcite .",
    "the numerical formalisms underlie recent software libraries and programs that have been applied to lhc phenomenology . in this approach , the one - loop amplitude in qcd",
    "is written as a sum over a set of basis integrals , with coefficients that are rational in external spinors , @xmath7 the integral basis for amplitudes with massless internal lines contains box , triangle , and bubble integrals in addition to purely rational terms ( dropping all terms of @xmath8 in the dimensional regulator ) .",
    "the coefficients are calculated from products of tree amplitudes , typically by performing contour integrals via discrete fourier projection . in the ossola ",
    " pittau ( opp ) approach  @xcite , this decomposition is carried out at the integrand level rather than at the level of integrated expressions .",
    "higher - loop amplitudes can also be written in the form given in .",
    "as at one loop , one can carry out such a decomposition at the level of the integrand .",
    "this generalization of the opp approach has been pursued by mastrolia and ossola  @xcite and collaborators , and also by badger , frellesvig , and  zhang  @xcite .",
    "the reader should consult refs .",
    "@xcite for further developments within this approach .",
    "arkani - hamed and collaborators have developed an integrand - level approach  @xcite specialized to planar contributions to the @xmath9 supersymmetric theory , but to all loop orders .    within the unitarity method applied at the level of integrated expressions , one can distinguish two basic approaches .",
    "in a ` minimal ' application of generalized unitarity , used in a number of prior applications and currently pursued by feng and huang  @xcite , one cuts just enough propagators to break apart a higher - loop amplitude into a product of disconnected tree amplitudes .",
    "each cut is then a product of tree amplitudes , but because not all possible propagators are cut , each generalized cut will correspond to several integrals , and algebra will be required to isolate specific integrals and their coefficients .",
    "this approach does not require a predetermined general basis of integrals ; it can be determined in the course of a specific calculation .",
    "a number of calculations have been done this way , primarily in the @xmath9 supersymmetric gauge theory  @xcite , but including several four - point calculations in qcd and supersymmetric theories with less - than - maximal supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a number of recent multi - loop calculations in maximally supersymmetric gauge and gravity theories have used maximal cuts  @xcite , without complete localization of integrands .",
    "we will use a more intensive form or ` maximal ' form of generalized unitarity . in this approach ,",
    "one cuts as many propagators as possible , and further seeks to fully localize integrands onto global poles to the extent possible . in principle , this allows one to isolate individual integrals on the right - hand side of the higher - loop analog of eq .",
    "( [ basicequation ] ) . in previous papers",
    "@xcite , we showed how to extract the coefficients of double - box master integrals using multidimensional contours around global poles . in this paper",
    ", we recast this operation as applying _",
    "generalized discontinuity operators _ ( gdos ) .",
    "each gdo corresponds to integrating the integrand of an amplitude or an integral along a specified linear combination of multidimensional contours around global poles .",
    "the gdos generalize the operation of cutting via the cutkosky - rule replacement of propagators by on - shell delta functions .",
    "some of the contour integrations in a gdo put internal lines on shell , equivalent to cutting propagators  .",
    "this integration will typically yield a jacobian giving rise to poles in the remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "in the case of the double box , the jacobian allows one to fully localize the remaining degrees of freedom through additional multidimensional contour integrals .",
    "the integrand is then fully localized at one of a set of global poles .",
    "we call these additional degrees of freedom ` localization variables ' .",
    "we include these additional dimensions of contours in the definition of the gdo .",
    "this maximal - unitarity approach may be viewed as a generalization to two loops of the work of britto , cachazo , and feng  @xcite , and of forde  @xcite .",
    "the gdos are constructed so that each one selects a specific master integral , @xmath10 applying it to then gives us an expression for the corresponding coefficent , @xmath11 the right - hand side will have the form of explicit contour integrals over localization variables of a product of tree amplitudes ; schematically , @xmath12    the weights with which the contours @xmath13 surround the different global poles are determined by a set of consistency equations .",
    "these equations require that integrals vanishing over the minkowski slice of complexified loop - momentum space are also annihiliated by the gdos , vanishing on the particular combinations of contours in each and every gdo .    in this paper",
    ", we continue the maximal - unitarity approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , relying on the global - pole analysis  @xcite of caron - huot and one of the present authors . at higher loops , the coefficients of the basis integrals",
    "are no longer rational functions of the external spinors alone , but will in general depend explicitly on the dimensional regulator @xmath14 .",
    "we consider gdos operating only on the four - dimensional components of the loop momenta , and accordingly extract only the leading terms , @xmath14-independent terms .",
    "gdos operating on the full @xmath15-dimensional loop momenta would be required to extract the remaining terms , and could presumably be used to obtain the rational terms in as well .    at two loops and beyond , the number of master integrals for a given topology will depend on the number and arrangement of external masses  @xcite .",
    "( see also recent work on a different organization of higher - loop integrals  @xcite . ) in previous papers , we have considered double boxes with no external masses  @xcite or with one , two , or three external masses  @xcite . in this article , we extend the gdo construction to planar double boxes with four external masses .",
    "we consider both the general case with unequal masses , and one special case with pairs of equal masses . in the general case , there are four master integrals ; in the special case with an extra reflection symmetry , three .",
    "sgaard  @xcite has constructed gdos for the non - planar massless double box .    as in previous work",
    ", we ensure the consistency of the gdos by requiring that they yield a vanishing result when applied to vanishing integrals . for the four - mass double box",
    ", it turns out that non - trivial constraints arise only from parity - odd integrands ; integration - by - parts ( ibp ) identities  @xcite give no additional constraints .",
    "the symmetry requirement for the special equal - mass case must also be imposed explicitly , and unlike fewer - mass cases , does not emerge automatically from ibp equations .",
    "we consider only two - loop master integrals with massless internal lines .",
    "we will not consider the generalization to massive internal lines ; but so long as there are sufficient massless internal lines to have at least one chiral vertex , the integrand should still have global poles , and we should expect the approach described here to generalize smoothly .",
