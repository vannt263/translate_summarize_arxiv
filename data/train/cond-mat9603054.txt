    "one of the interesting and challenging sub - fields of low - dimensional quantum magnetism which has emerged from the wealth of activity directed at improving the understanding of high - temperature superconductors is that of ladder systems @xcite . these consist of @xmath2 parallel , interacting chains of @xmath3 = ions , which can be considered as a spin ladder with @xmath2 legs , and rungs of @xmath2 - 1 bonds .",
    "the ladders have only weak mutual interactions .",
    "a combination of experimental and theoretical efforts has in the last few years produced significant advances in the realization and understanding of the properties of spin ladders , some of which are not at all intuitive .",
    "ladder cuprates emerged first with the discovery by hiroi _",
    "et al._@xcite that in the series of materials sr@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 it is possible to create two - dimensional , stoichiometric copper oxide planes of composition cu@xmath5 o@xmath6 by removing from the uniform cuo@xmath7 plane parallel , equally - spaced lines of oxygen atoms .",
    "it was pointed out by rice _",
    "et al._@xcite that because these shear defects give rise to only weak , ferromagnetic interactions between neighboring copper spins , the remaining strips of cuo@xmath7 plane will appear as isolated @xmath2 + 1-leg ladders of antiferromagnetically coupled spins .",
    "these authors proposed that the systems should then illustrate the contrasting , and now well - established properties of even- and odd - leg ladders , that the former show a gap to spin excitations ( spin gap ) with consequent exponential spatial decay of correlations , while the latter are gapless with power - law decays .",
    "subsequent susceptibility @xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite experiments have amply borne out this conjecture .",
    "the theoretical understanding of ladders has been in large part based on numerical techniques , which are particularly well suited to systems of such restricted dimensionality , and this is reviewed in ref .",
    "the first indications that the 2-leg ladder should exhibit a spin gap came from numerical work @xcite , and a variety of methods has since been applied to investigate the spin gap and spin correlations , and the properties of multi - leg ladders.@xcite these studies not only confirm the picture of the spin system emerging from analytic approaches @xcite valid in certain limits , but provide the most accurate information available on the properties of this class of strongly - correlated systems .",
    "the second proposal concerning the properties of ladder compounds made in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the doped ladder should become superconducting with a @xmath8-wave order parameter , has proved harder to test for materials reasons .",
    "however , the compound lacuo@xmath0 , recently synthesized by hiroi and takano,@xcite has been found to admit hole doping without altering its structure of coupled , 2-leg copper oxide ladders , and so constitutes the first case in which one may seek doping - dependent behavior analogous to that of the high - temperature superconductors .",
    "the high - pressure phase of la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath0 is derived from a cubic , three - dimensional perovskite structure .",
    "the absence of oxygen atoms along lines leaves 2-leg ladders which relax from a relative angle of 90@xmath11 in the primitive structure to 62@xmath11 in the depleted one .",
    "the material is then orthorhombic ( space group p@xmath12 ) , with four copper atoms per unit cell , and may be considered as a set of ladders oriented along the @xmath13-axis , and periodically arrayed in the @xmath14- and @xmath15-directions , as shown in fig .",
    "this structure is not altered with sr doping to @xmath16 .",
    "the interladder coupling in the ( @xmath17 ) plane arises because each oxygen atom at the outside edges of the 2-leg ladders , which is part of the planar cuo@xmath18 unit , is also effectively apical to a copper atom in a neighboring ladder , contributing to a finite transfer integral .",
    "susceptibility measurements @xcite on the parent compound up to temperatures of 500k , interpreted by a formula proposed by troyer _",
    "et al._,@xcite suggest the presence of a spin gap in the excitation spectrum , and therefore a spin liquid state .",
    "in contrast , nmr studies of the same samples @xcite indicate that the system orders antiferromagnetically at low temperatures , below an apparent @xmath19k",
    ". since the spin susceptibility should evolve continuously as one passes through the quantum critical point separating the spin - liquid state and the state with long - range antiferromagnetic order , it is possible that even in the latter , close to the quantum critical point , the spin susceptibility will decrease substantially as the temperature is lowered . such behavior may be difficult to distinguish from that of a true spin liquid with a finite gap .",
    "therefore it is plausible that the seemingly contradictory experimental results may be reconciled if the magnetic state is close to the crossover from an antiferromagnet to the spin liquid .",
    "here we seek evidence , by examining the effects of interladder interactions , that the system is indeed close to this quantum critical point .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we present a tight - binding fit to the lda bandstructure to extract the interladder hopping matrix elements , and use these to obtain the superexchange interactions .",
    "we consider in section iii the nature of the spin - liquid ground state for ladders of spins coupled in both orthogonal directions , using a mean - field approach to estimate the location of the quantum critical point . in section",
    "iv we introduce a double - occupancy term to the tight - binding bands , to investigate the degree of three - dimensional character in the electronic structure as a result of interladder interactions .",
    "section v contains our conclusions and a brief discussion .",
    "the bandstructure of lacuo@xmath0 has been computed by mattheiss,@xcite using the local density approximation ( lda ) method . here",
    "we examine the dispersion of only the highest occupied valence bands , and use a tight - binding model based on the single , copper - based orbital in each planar cuo@xmath18 unit within the ladder which lies closest to the chemical potential : in the cu@xmath5o@xmath6 strip this is the antibonding , cu - centered 3@xmath20 orbital . restricting the set of hopping matrix elements to those between nearby copper atoms",
    ", we obtain an effective one - band model , albeit with four mixed levels ( one from each cu atom in the unit cell ) .",
    "these generate a complex of four bands , which lie close to or cut the fermi energy .",
    "the complex is half - filled in the undoped system , and well separated from other bands on the small energy scales of most physical interest , so can be taken to determine the low - energy behavior of the model . with this interpretation",
    ", one may deduce the ratio @xmath21 , of inter- and intraladder atomic orbital overlap , and thus estimate the ratio @xmath22 of the magnetic interactions , by using the superexchange result @xcite @xmath23 .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian is @xmath24 in which @xmath25 and @xmath26 each denote a pair ( @xmath27 ) , where @xmath2 labels the unit cell , and @xmath28 the different atoms within each cell .",
    "the hopping matrix elements @xmath29 may be taken to be short - ranged , and the maximal set which we need to achieve a reasonable fit is illustrated in fig .",
    "starting from tight - binding parameter fits in the two - dimensional cuo@xmath7 plane,@xcite we choose the nearest - neighbor intraladder parameters , @xmath30 for hopping along a rung and @xmath31 for hopping along a leg , to have the same value @xmath32ev .",
    "we use as the next - nearest - neighbor parameters @xmath33@xmath34 and @xmath35@xmath36 for hopping across a square plaquette in the ladder , and along two leg bonds , respectively .",
    "finally , we introduce a parameter @xmath37 for hopping from a copper atom on one ladder to its neighbor on the adjacent ladder , and also the next - neighbor analog @xmath38 for transfer between atoms on adjacent ladders with a relative displacement of one leg bond . because of the low symmetry of the lacuo@xmath0 structure , the cu-(apical ) o - cu interladder bond is far from straight , with the cuo@xmath39 pyramids quite irregular , and this distortion may allow a substantial value of @xmath37 . the role of each of the terms in the fitting scheme",
    "will be illustrated below .",
    "the next - neighbor parameters @xmath40 are expected to be significantly smaller than their direct counterparts , due to the short - range nature of the overlaps , and the important parameter to fit will be the ratio of @xmath37 to @xmath30 .    the hamiltonian ( [ esh ] ) may be expressed in matrix form in reciprocal space as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the vector of creation operators @xmath43 for the bloch states formed by separate linear combination of the @xmath20 orbitals of each copper atom in the unit cell , and @xmath44 is a vector in the orthorhombic brillouin zone . setting the lattice constants @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 to unity , the hamiltonian matrix is @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50@xmath51 , in which the factor @xmath52@xmath51 arises because @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and the bond vectors @xmath55(@xmath56 ) and @xmath57(@xmath58 ) are shown in fig .",
    "the eigenvalue problem gives an equation quadratic in the squares of the mode frequencies , whose solutions are the dispersion relations of the four energy bands @xmath59^{1/2 } \\label{eqpb } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\;\\;\\;\\ ; - 2 t_z   \\cos k_z - 2 t_{z}^{\\prime } \\cos 2 k_z .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this concise , closed form emerges because the exponential factors @xmath60 may be collected as @xmath61 , as @xmath62 .",
    "the general dispersion simplifies further for particular values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the brillouin zone : in particular , on the zone faces ( @xmath65 ) , the last term in the square root vanishes and the bands are doubly degenerate , as required by the group - theoretical analysis of structures with non - symmorphic space groups .",
    "the dispersions of the 4 bands are shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) for a series of high - symmetry lines in the orthorhombic brillouin zone , and for the ratio @xmath66 .",
    "the labelling of points is shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) , and their order is chosen to match the results of mattheiss.@xcite also shown in the figure are the energy - spacings dictated by the choice of the tight - binding parameters , as these vary between their maximum and minimum values along the chosen directions .    for an isolated ladder along @xmath67 ,",
    "i.e. with no interladder interactions ( @xmath68 ) , the bands would be completely flat around @xmath69xsy@xmath69 and zurtz , with only a cosine dispersion ( mildly perturbed by the @xmath70 term ) along @xmath69z . in this situation",
    "there would be two doubly - degenerate bands around the zone center and zone face , corresponding to the bonding and antibonding bands of each ladder .",
    "these features are reflected in the two branches observed in fig .",
    "2(a ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eqpb ] ) , the separation of the degenerate bands along the zone face xsy and edge urt is governed by the combinations @xmath71 , and the splitting of the degeneracy along @xmath69x , @xmath69y and zu , zt by the combinations @xmath72 .",
    "considering first the intraladder parameters @xmath31 , @xmath70 , @xmath30 and @xmath73 chosen from the two - dimensional cuo@xmath7 plane , we find good agreement of the tight - binding result with that from lda .",
    "particularly notable is that the negative sign of @xmath73 , and the relative magnitude @xmath34 , are required to reproduce the bands separations along xsy and urt .",
    "there is no evidence that a value of @xmath30 different from @xmath31 would improve the fit .",
    "the next - neighbor hopping parameter along the ladder , @xmath70 , appears only as an asymmetry of the cosine dispersion along @xmath69z , and the value chosen is in qualitative accord with the lda result .",
    "that cuo@xmath7 plane parameters remain appropriate for the ladder confirms the predominantly local picture of the interactions between copper sites . turning to the band splitting at the @xmath69 and z points , we find that the relatively large value @xmath74@xmath34 ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) gives the best qualitative reproduction of the bands crossing the chemical potential in the full lda calculation by mattheiss,@xcite but that the value @xmath75@xmath34 appears closer to the results of a `` 12-parameter fit '' illustrated in the same reference .",
    "the difference of the @xmath69 and z splittings is given rather well by the starting choice of @xmath76@xmath77 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "2 that the primary feature of the dispersion remains that in the @xmath78 direction , i.e. along the ladder .",
    "the fermi surfaces for each band are determined almost exclusively by this part of the dispersion , in that they appear as sheets which are almost flat , perturbed little by the @xmath30 and @xmath37 terms , and have @xmath78 as normal . at half - filling ,",
    "the lowest band is an exception to this situation , because part of it is also filled close to the z point .",
    "on doping with holes , this region is rapidly emptied ( below 5% ) so that all four fermi surfaces are sheets parallel to the ( @xmath79 ) plane .",
    "only when the doping level reaches 20% does the chemical potential drop below the highest band in the @xmath69xsy@xmath69 plane , causing a pocket to open at the @xmath69 point for this band .    in summary , we find that a simple model of a single orbital per copper atom provides a good fit to the bandstructure . while there is scope for some variation in the choice of intraladder parameters , with this level of agreement between the tight - binding results and those of lda it is not worthwhile to optimize further .",
    "we choose to work with the above values of the intraladder hopping matrix elements , and with the interladder overlap @xmath74@xmath80 , bearing in mind that this latter will be close to the upper limit of the narrow range of probable values . estimating the superexchange interaction by @xmath81 leads us to conclude that the interaction between spins on neighboring ladders will have a magnitude @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the intraladder magnetic coupling of both rung and leg spins . because @xmath84 is an appreciable fraction of @xmath83",
    ", it is clear that the spin interactions in lacuo@xmath0 will have significant three - dimensional character .",
    "a mean - field analysis of the spin state for ladder systems was introduced by gopalan _",
    "@xcite , and in this section we follow closely the treatment of these authors .",
    "they employed a bond operator representation of @xmath85 quantum spins , used initially @xcite to investigate dimerized spin phases in two - dimensional systems , exploiting the fact that the topology of the ladder favors dimerization , particularly when the spin interaction , @xmath83 , on a rung exceeds that on a leg , @xmath86 .",
    "the authors proceeded in the mean - field approximation to consider first the properties of an isolated ladder as a function of the interaction ratio @xmath87 , then of periodic arrays of ladders in two dimensions , and finally of an array of frustrated double ladders of the type found in the srcu@xmath7o@xmath88 system.@xcite this approach can be considered to be exact in the limit where @xmath89 and the spins form dimers on every rung , while its accuracy will diminish on extrapolating through finite @xmath87 towards the desired isotropic point , @xmath90 .",
    "we begin by representing the system of spin ladders , each coupled by two identical bonds per spin to separate , neighboring ladders , in a geometrically simpler but topologically identical form , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . note that the spin configuration for local , antiferromagnetic interactions is unfrustrated , so a transition to an ordered antiferromagnet may be expected with increasing interladder coupling .",
    "the magnetic interactions are taken to be @xmath83 for spins on the same rung , @xmath86 for spins separated by a leg bond , and @xmath91 for neighboring spins on different ladders , while no other couplings are considered .",
    "the hamiltonian for the spins is @xmath92 where @xmath26 is a rung bond index and the labels @xmath93 and @xmath94 denote spins on the left and right sides of the ladder . following ref .",
    "@xcite , transformation to the bond - operator representation yields @xmath95 where @xmath96 @xmath97 and @xmath98 in these equations , @xmath99 is the creation operator for a spin singlet on bond @xmath26 , the operators @xmath100 create the three possible triplet states on the same bond , and the lagrange multiplier , @xmath101 , introduced to ensure the constraint @xmath102 on each bond , which restricts the physical spin states to singlets or triplets , appears as an effective chemical potential .",
    "the part @xmath103 in ( [ ebosh ] ) contains terms with three and four @xmath104 operators , and will be neglected in our approximation ; in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown in addition that the effects of such higher - order terms are small .    because the singlet on each bond has the lowest energy , we assume that the system condenses into this state , leading to a finite expectation value of the bosonic @xmath105 operator , @xmath106 . this is the average expectation value , or mean - field value of the operators @xmath105 , and the site - dependent chemical potential @xmath101",
    "is also replaced by a global average value @xmath107 .",
    "working with the physical unit cell ( fig .",
    "3 ) , which contains two rungs , we may transform the operators @xmath104 in @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 to those for two types of triplets , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the hamiltonian in this approximation is @xcite @xmath113   + \\left [ \\lambda_{\\bf k}^{\\prime }   t_{{\\bf k } \\alpha}^{1 \\dag } t_{{\\bf k } \\alpha}^{2 } \\right . \\\\ & &   \\left .",

    "the part of @xmath118 ( [ emfsh ] ) dependent on the triplet operators is diagonalized by the non - unitary , bosonic bogoliubov transformation @xmath119 whose coefficients are given by @xmath120 where in turn @xmath121 yield the dispersion relations of the two magnon branches .",
    "the hamiltonian now takes the form @xmath122 which contains the mean - field part and the zero - point quantum corrections from the triplet magnon excitations .",
    "the mean - field equations to be solved self - consistently for @xmath107 and @xmath123 are given by @xmath124 and @xmath125 where @xmath126 contain the dispersive parts of @xmath127 .",
    "@xmath128 denotes the magnon thermal occupation function , and will be discussed in more detail in a future publication .",
    "the factor of 3 preceding the @xmath44-summations in both equations is the result of the sum over @xmath129 for the three triplet magnon states.@xcite this factor was omitted in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we comment below on the effect of the correction on the results presented there .",
    "the mean - field equations are solved at zero temperature , where the thermal factor becomes unity , and by taking the continuum limit in which the @xmath44-sum becomes an integral over three - dimensional reciprocal space .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite we reduce the two equations to a single one for the variable @xmath130 which has the form @xmath131 as a characteristic parameter of the spin - liquid ground state , we will be most interested in the value of the spin gap , the minimum excitation energy of the lower branch of the triplet magnon excitations , which is given by @xmath132 with @xmath8 determined by the mean - field equation ( [ escd ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eqd ] ) we see that the excitation spectrum has a minimum at the wavevector @xmath133 in the reciprocal lattice of the bipartite structure shown in fig .",
    "3 . the value of @xmath134 where @xmath135 is driven to zero will give the transition from the spin liquid state , where the spin orientation fluctuates with a time - averaged value of zero and with short - range correlations primarily at @xmath136 , to a magnetically ordered state characterized by @xmath136 .",
    "this wavevector corresponds to uniform polarization of the spin singlets on ladder rungs in the ( @xmath17 ) plane , with spins oppositely directed between neighboring planes in the @xmath13-direction , i.e. a simple antiferromagnetically aligned spin pattern .    in the limit of no interladder coupling",
    "we obtain the spin gap @xmath137 of the isolated , isotropic ( @xmath90 ) 2-leg ladder .",
    "this is only a mean - field result , but is in very good agreement with the result @xmath138 of numerical studies @xcite by the density matrix renormalization group technique .",
    "in fact this agreement is largely serendipitous , and deteriorates on taking into account the higher - order terms @xcite ; in the mean - field approximation , the spin gap of the isolated ladder diverges logarithmically in the limit of large @xmath87,@xcite and the effects of this increase are already manifest at @xmath90 , causing the mean - field result , which initially underestimates the spin gap , to recover towards the exact value determined numerically . in this treatment",
    "we have not had to invoke a self - energy correction term : in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors investigated the curious qualitative behavior of the solution to their ( erroneous ) mean - field equation by expanding in small @xmath87 about the limit of strong rung coupling where the dimer treatment is accurate . in the corrected mean - field theory ,",
    "one obtains @xmath139 which corresponds reasonably well to the result @xmath140 of a detailed strong - coupling analysis including excitation modes.@xcite previously , the coefficient of the quadratic term had been found to be negative , and so a self - energy term @xmath141 was introduced to correct for short - range interaction effects which appeared to have been missing at the mean - field level ; the chosen value @xmath142 brought the results into good argeement with previous numerical ones , and with the above approximate treatments .",
    "the spin gap obtained from the solution of ( [ escd ] ) for the three - dimensionally coupled ladder system is shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) as a function of the interladder coupling @xmath134 , for fixed @xmath90 .",
    "we see immediately that the spin gap decreases monotonically , with the transition point at @xmath143 .",
    "comparison with the result of section ii indicates that the lacuo@xmath0 system should lie within the ordered antiferromagnetic regime , but that it is indeed located in the vicinity of the quantum critical point marking the phase transition from spin liquid to magnetic order .",
    "it is also instructive to compare the appearance of the spin gap with that in a two - dimensional , unfrustrated , periodic array of coupled ladders.@xcite in this case there is only one magnon branch , and the dispersive factor in the excitation spectrum is @xmath144 where @xmath63 is a wavevector parallel to a ladder rung .",
    "again @xmath145 corresponds to a simple antiferromagnetic spin alignment in the ordered phase , and the factor of appears because there is only one bond per spin between ladders in such a system .",
    "the spin gap for the two - dimensional array is shown as a function of @xmath134 in fig .",
    "4(b ) , where again @xmath90 and the gap at @xmath146 is that of the isolated , isotropic ladder .",
    "the critical value of the interladder coupling , @xmath147 , is seen to be significantly greater than twice that in the three - dimensional case above , as might be expected for the simple reason that there are half as many interladder interactions , which may be taken as an indication that the spin liquid state is more robust in lower dimensions .",
    "the almost linear decrease , in contrast to the downward curvature of the function in fig .",
    "4(a ) , illustrates a further effect of dimensionality , and agrees well with the qualitative result of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we may conclude that to within the accuracy of the mean - field approach for an isotropic ladder system , the above analysis provides good evidence that lacuo@xmath0 lies on the magnetically ordered side of the quantum critical regime of the transition between spin liquid and antiferromagnet .",
    "we have seen in the previous sections that the interladder interactions in lacuo@xmath0 are quite strong , and possibly sufficiently strong to change the magnetic structure from a spin liquid to a three - dimensionally ordered antiferromagnet . to examine further the character of the electronic structure ,",
    "we introduce an on - site coulomb interaction , @xmath1 , to the tight - binding bandstructure of section ii , and perform a hartree - fock calculation of an ordered antiferromagnetic state . in a strictly one - dimensional system , the critical value of @xmath1 necessary to stabilize an insulating antiferromagnet vanishes at half - filling , whereas in a general , three - dimensional electronic structure it is of the order of the bandwidth .",
    "introduction of the on - site coulomb interaction leads to a hubbard hamiltonian @xmath148 examining the stability of an antiferromagnetic state with wavevector @xmath136 , we note first that there will be no increase of the unit cell in the ( @xmath17 ) plane , since there are already two atoms for each spin direction , but that it doubles along @xmath149 when the spins order along the ladder legs . in the notation of @xmath150 and @xmath151 sublattices for the bipartite system , sites @xmath152 of the original unit cell ( fig .",

    "are required to obtain a mott insulator at half - filling , but the perfect - nesting property of a one - dimensional band gives an insulating state for arbitrarily small values of @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "5(b ) , the average antiferromagnetic order ( parameterized by @xmath156 ) in the half - filled system is shown as a function of the on - site repulsion @xmath1 , which is measured in terms of the bandwidth @xmath184ev . in lacuo@xmath0",
    "we find that the critical value @xmath185 for the antiferromagnetic transition is rather small , @xmath186 , which indicates substantial one - dimensional nature .",
    "the interladder hopping matrix elements , although quite strong , are not sufficient to destroy the nesting character completely , which would make the electronic structure effectively three - dimensional .",
    "this quasi - one dimensional behavior of the bands may also be reflected in the sensitivity of the system to random potential fluctuations .",
    "it is well known that the onset of localization is strongly dependent on dimensionality .",
    "clearly , in ladder compounds there is an inherent conflict between the need to change the valence of the counterions in order to induce hole carriers , and the need to avoid strong , random potential fluctuations .",
    "thus it appears that in la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath0 the random potential fluctuations act to cause localization for @xmath187 , in spite of the substantial interladder overlap , suggesting that a more gentle hole - doping technique will be required to retain itinerant character at small doping concentrations .",
    "this could perhaps be achieved in structures where the counterions are further from the ladders than in the present case of lacuo@xmath0 .",
    "we have investigated the basic electronic and magnetic properties of the three - dimensionally coupled 2-leg ladder compound lacuo@xmath0 , a material which is of significant experimental and theoretical interest as it is the first ladder compound to be discovered in which the cu@xmath7o@xmath88 ladders may be doped with holes .",
    "we present a tight - binding fit in which the bands are derived from a single ( @xmath20 ) orbital close to the fermi energy on each copper atom .",
    "the results of lda studies are well reproduced by reasonable values of the most significant transfer integrals : those within each ladder are found to be similar to the cuo@xmath7 planar system , emphasizing the short - range nature of the dominant physical processes , while the interladder hopping term @xmath188@xmath189 is found to be quite large . as a consequence ,",
    "the interladder magnetic coupling @xmath84 is also relatively large , and the compound may be expected to exhibit some three - dimensional characteristics .",
    "the effective spin interactions in this structure are those of unfrustrated antiferromagnetism , and a mean - field treatment of the magnetic state from the basis of dimerized singlets on the rungs of decoupled ladders gives a spin - liquid phase whose spin gap decreases with increasing interladder coupling .",
    "the spin gap is found to vanish , signalling a transition to an ordered phase , at an interladder coupling ratio @xmath190 somewhat smaller than that deduced for lacuo@xmath0 , indicating that the system is located in the antiferromagnetically ordered state , albeit not far from the quantum critical point of the ordering transition .",
    "we may take the very small value of the intrinsic susceptibility measured at low temperatures @xcite as evidence that proximity to the critical point , and the possibility this allows of significant critical fluctuations , plays an important role in determining the physics of the system .",
    "further insight into the electronic properties is provided by the introduction of an on - site repulsion term , @xmath1 , to the band scheme : within the hartree - fock approximation we find that in the half - filled system the transition to an antiferromagnetic insulator occurs for values of @xmath1 quite small compared to the bandwidth .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that the predominant feature of the bands remains the dispersion in the ladder direction , and this one - dimensionality , also apparent in the fermi surfaces of the partially - filled bands , makes the system inherently susceptible to potential fluctuations . that @xmath185 is finite illustrates an absence of perfect nesting conditions in the bandstructure , and the instability occurs at the antiferromagnetic wavevector .",
    "our results represent the first theoretical consideration of the lacuo@xmath0 system . while by the nature of the approximate techniques used they are somewhat inexact",
    ", we believe that they are important in establishing the parameter space for the magnetic state , and in focussing the direction of further research .",
    "the properties of such `` nearly critical '' magnetic systems have been studied for the two - dimensional , planar case by detailed analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite techniques .",
    "we propose the application of similar methods for the case of ladder systems with variable interladder coupling in two additional dimensions , to investigate the nature of the critical point , and the surrounding `` quantum critical '' regime , in the same formalism , with particular emphasis on the appearance of physical quantities accessible in experiment .",
    "such studies may prove valuable in establishing the framework within which to interpret the data from experiment , and hopefully will serve to reconcile the apparent contradiction in current results .",
    "the observation that the spin liquid is not the appropriate description of the magnetic ground state in lacuo@xmath0 is itself important , particularly with regard to the current interpretation of the susceptibility data.@xcite while it may be possible to deduce the form of the susceptibility suitable for the critical regime from a mean - field picture , we await the results of numerical studies of the same system in order to make a more detailed comparison with the data .",
    "a further direction not strongly emphasized in this communication is the nature of the doped system : the methods used here become less accurate at finite doping , and so were not studied in great detail in this regime , but may nonetheless be used to obtain additional insight into the evolution of spin properties on moving towards the metallic state .",
