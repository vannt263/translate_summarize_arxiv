    "recently research boom in nanotechnologies has started to search and investigate new nanoscale materials , like nanocrystals , graphene , carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) , boron nitride nanotubes ( bnnt ) , and their complexes , because of their unique properties .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of nanoscale structures , processes , and properties are very promising in the wide range of physical parameters , because of necessity to investigate wide range of parameters ( so - called `` parameter sweeping '' ) .",
    "md simulations with such `` parameter sweeping '' can be carried out in the available heterogeneous distributed computing infrastructure ( dci ) with desktop grids , service grids , clusters , supercomputers , cloud resources .",
    "the recent advances in computing algorithms and infrastructures , especially in development of dcis , allow us to solve these tasks efficiently without expensive scaling - up , especially by means of the science gateway ( sg ) technology on the basis of ws - pgrade platform for workflow management and guse technology for integration of dci - resources @xcite . here",
    "we demonstrate the capabilities of these technologies realized for md simulations and further data post - processing on the basis of lammps package for md simulation @xcite , and other packages like r for statistical analysis @xcite , pizza.py toolkit for manipulations with atomic coordinates files @xcite , atomeye for visualisation of atomic configurations @xcite , debyer for simulation of x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and neutron diffraction ( nd ) analysis ( https://code.google.com/p/debyer/ ) , etc .",
    "several typical workflows were created for simulation of several physical processes with various demands for the computing resources : tension of metal nanocrystals under different physical conditions , tension of ensemble of metal nanocrystals under the same conditions , manipulations with complex nanostructures like indentation of graphene membranes , thermal stability of bnnt , etc .",
    "scientists from user communities outside of computer science itself ( for example , in materials science , physics , chemistry , biology , nanotechnologies , etc . ) would like to access various dcis ( grids , clouds , clusters ) and concentrate on their scientific applications themselves in a such transparent way , that they do not need to learn the peculiarities of these dcis .",
    "in general , `` science gateway '' ( sg ) implies a user - friendly intuitive interface between scientists ( or scientific communities ) , various software ( standard and/or proprietary ) and heterogenous dcis . usually , sgs are not specialized for a certain scientific area and scientists from many different fields can use them . by means of sgs researchers",
    "can focus on their scientific goals and less on assembling the required dci components .",
    "the most important aspects of sg are : a simplified intuitive graphical user interface ( gui ) that is highly tailored to the needs of the given scientific community ; a smooth access to national and international computing and storage resources ; collaborative tools for sharing scientific data on national and international scale .",
    "several sg technologies and frameworks are known ( like askalon @xcite , moteur @xcite , ws - pgrade / guse / dci - bridge @xcite ) , which use different enabling components and technologies : web application containers ( tomcat , glassfish , etc . ) , portal or web application frameworks ( liferay , spring , drupal , etc . ) , database management systems ( mysql , etc . ) , workflow management systems @xcite . here",
    "usage of ws - pgrade / guse / dci - bridge is described with some examples in physics , materials science , nanotechnologies .",
    "the architecture of science gateway ideology on the basis of guse+ws - pgrade+dci - bridge technologies ( https://guse.sztaki.hu ) is described in details elsewhere @xcite . in short ,",
    "ws - pgrade portal technology is a web based front end of the guse infrastructure .",
    "guse ( grid and cloud user support environment ) is a permanently improving open source sg framework developed by laboratory of parallel and distributed systems ( mta - sztaki , budapest , hungary ) , that provides the convenient and easy access to dci .",
    "it gives the generic purpose , workflow - oriented gui to create and manage workflows on various dcis .",
    "ws - pgrade supports development and submission of distributed applications executed on the computational resources of dcis .",
    "the resources of dcis ( including clusters , service grids , desktop grids , clouds ) are connected to the guse by a single point back end , the dci - bridge @xcite .",
    "`` imp science gateway portal '' @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : portal_gui ] ) is based on the ws - pgrade / guse / dc - bridge framework @xcite , which is the complex system with many features .",
    "it distinguishes different user communities : administrators , power - users and end - users .",
    "the administrators operate portal itself .",
    "the power - users can develop new workflow applications by means of various workflow features ( graph , abstract workflow , template , application ) .",
    "the workflows and their components are stored in built - in repository and published by the application developers , which can be shared among end - users .",
    "it provides scientific workflow management for both application developers and end users , and supports various dcis including clusters , service grids , desktop grids and cloud .",
    "`` imp science gateway portal '' leverages easy and simple gui utilities for power - users ( application developers ) to create ( easily in lego - style manner ) the complex workflows ( fig .",
    "[ fig : al_wf_scheme]a ) from separate simple components , which can be standard or proprietary executables , scripts in various languages , and command - line arguments ( fig .",
    "[ fig : al_wf_scheme]b ) . application developers can design and create complex workflows with taking into account various runtimes and resources needed for each component ( fig .",
    "[ fig : al_wf_scheme]c ) , and output data type and size ( fig .",
    "[ fig : al_wf_scheme]d ) .",
    "end - users can submit , monitor , save , upload , and retrieve various workflows with one or many jobs , and obtain intermediate or final results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : al_wf_scheme]d ) .",
    "a )   b )   c )   d )    the whole process of the complex workflow creation and management can be demonstrated by the md simulation of tension of metal nanocrystals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : al_wf_scheme]a ) with the following steps : ( 1 ) to register / sign in `` imp science gateway portal '' ; ( 2 ) to create a graph scheme for the basic components of the workflow ( yellow bricks with small input - output ports - squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : al_wf_scheme]a ) ; ( 3 ) to create a workflow from the graph ; ( 4 ) to configure the workflow ( links between yellow bricks in fig .  [",
    "fig : al_wf_scheme]a ) ; ( 5 ) to run the workflow ; ( 6 ) to monitor the current status of execution .",
    "the complex workflow ( fig .",
    "[ fig : al_wf_scheme ] ) for this application contains several independent components ( lammps package , pizza.py toolkit , atomeye package , debyer , r - package , ffmpeg ) , which can be combined in various sets for the purposes of the end users @xcite .",
    "the end - users can check the intermediate results : after md simulation by lammps package ( tables in the red rectangles in the center of fig .  [",
    "fig : al_wf_scheme]d ) ; converted by pizza.py toolkit script package for post - processing ( table in the red rectangle in the bottom of fig .",

    "[ fig : al_wf_scheme]d ) ; post - processed results of x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and neutron diffraction ( nd ) analysis obtained by debyer ( tables in the blue rectangles in the bottom part of fig .",
    "[ fig : al_wf_scheme]d ) ; final results after xrd and nd analysis , coordination number ( cn ) and radial distribution function ( rdf ) analysis , and stress - strain ( ss ) analysis obtained by r - package ( plots in the green rectangles at the left and right sides of fig .",

    "`` imp science gateway portal '' uses local resources ( server side ) , several clusters ( pbs ) with different configuration and policies , tests desktop grids ( boinc ) and cluster grids ( arc ) , and plans to use supercomputers and clouds . in this context",
    ", the different requirements for the various components were taken into account as to their possible location , runtime , output file size ( see table  [ table : components ] ) .",
    ".the components of the general workflow ( fig .  [ fig : al_wf_scheme ] ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     other means for increase of sg - efficiency , like dual - layer hardware and software management in cluster systems @xcite , will be also of interest and great value and should be taken into account .",
    "additional important aspect is related with the failed jobs , which should be re - run .",
    "the problem is that for the big number of jobs ( each for different set of parameters ) it was not very easy to filter the faulty jobs and re - run them again . at this stage , it was performed manually by means of job management system , but it would be more efficient , if this will done automatically by sg after obtaining the corresponding report .",
    "science gateway portal ( like `` imp science gateway portal '' ) for md simulations of complex behavior of various nanostructures can be relatively easily created on the basis of ws - pgrade technology for workflow management .",
    "these resourceful md simulations can be effectively carried out in the heterogeneous dci by means of guse technology for parallel and distributed computing in various heterogeneous dcis .",
    "several typical scientific applications were considered as use cases of their porting and practical using .",
    "several advantages should be emphasized : ( 1 ) the modular - based ( `` lego - style '' ) principle of workflow creation and management ; ( 2 ) easy access to heterogeneous dci and software ; ( 3 ) division of user roles ( administrators as operators of portals ; power users as principal scientists ; end users as scientists , students ) ; ( 4 ) short learning curve for usual scientists without extensive knowledge in computer science .",
    "some ways for further improvement were briefly outlined in relation to the better performance and efficiency . finally , the `` science gateway '' approach ",
    "workflow manager ( like ws - pgrade ) + dci resources manager ( like guse ) at the premises of the portal ( like `` imp science gateway portal '' )  is very promising in the context of its practical md applications in materials science , physics , chemistry , biology , and nanotechnologies .",
