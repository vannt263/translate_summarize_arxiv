    "the wide field infrared survey telescope ",
    "astrophysics focused telescope asset ( wfirst - afta ) is a nasa space observatory that has been designed to probe dark energy , to carry out wide - field near infrared ( nir ) surveys , and to discover and characterize extrasolar planets ( hereafter exoplanets ) in the visible spectrum .",
    "wfirst - afta will make use of an existing 2.4-m aperture telescope and will advance what is currently possible in exoplanet spectral characterization and imaging .",
    "the telescope feeds an instrument suite consisting of a wide - field imager ( wfi ) and a coronagraph instrument ( cgi ) .",
    "these two instruments are complementary .",
    "the wfi will collect nir statistical data on planetary systems over large regions of the sky using gravitational microlensing , whereas the coronagraph will carry out direct imaging and detailed visible spectroscopy of a sample of exoplanets .",
    "the coronagraph will be able to detect and characterize cold jupiters , mini - neptunes , and possibly super - earths@xcite and for the first time directly image planets analogous to those in our solar system .",
    "this spectroscopic characterization will reveal the atmospheric composition of these planets and will be used to search for spectral signatures of life .",
    "in addition , the coronagraph will be used to characterize debris disks in and around planetary orbits  an important tool that can be used to improve our understanding of planet formation .    in order to adequately form images and collect spectra of exoplanets ,",
    "it is necessary to suppress the starlight to a contrast of order 10@xmath0 for cold jupiters , mini - neptunes , and super- earths .",
    "the coronagraph accomplishes this by using ( 1 ) a series of masks to reject starlight , to block diffracted light , and to reduce starlight speckles , and ( 2 ) an adaptive optics system , employing a pair of deformable mirrors ( dms ) in order to eliminate residual speckles due to optical imperfections in the entire optical beamtrain .",
    "the result is a high - contrast point - spread function ( psf ) with a dark hole between inner and outer working angles allowing observations of faint companions .",
    "the wfirst - cgi can operate in two modes : ( 1 ) a hybrid lyot coronagraph ( hlc ) for exoplanet photometry and discovery , and ( 2 ) a shaped pupil coronagraph ( spc ) for exoplanet spectroscopy and debris disk characterization .",
    "the hlc uses a focal plane phase - amplitude mask , whereas the spc uses a pupil mask with binary apodization .",
    "the flight instrument comprises a single optical beam train that will be operated in either the hlc or spc mode .",
    "the cgi switches between the two operational configurations using active rotary mechanisms to change pupil masks , focal plane masks , lyot masks , bandpass filters , and an actuated fold mirror to select either the imaging camera or the integral field spectrograph ( ifs ) . in both the hlc and spc modes ,",
    "the pair of dms is used for closed - loop reduction of speckle .",
    "this dual mode architecture enables the optimum coronagraph configuration to be used for the different types of planet / disk characterization .",
    "the two coronagraph architectures are complementary .",
    "the hlc can achieve deeper contrast at certain working angles , whereas the spc is relatively insensitive to jitter and has lower chromaticity .        in order to maintain the contrast stability over observation times , a low - order wavefront sensor and control system in the coronagraph",
    "is used to sense and correct lower - order wavefront error resulting from ( 1 ) thermally - induced optical misalignment and optical surface distortions , and ( 2 ) line - of - sight ( los ) jitter caused by vibration sources , such as the spacecraft reaction wheels and the wfi cryocooler .",
    "a zernike wavefront sensor uses the rejected starlight to sense aberrations from z1,2 ( x- and y - tilts ) up to and including z11 ( spherical aberration ) .",
    "the x- and y - tilts resulting from los jitter are corrected using a fast steering mirror , whereas the low - order wavefront drifts are corrected by a pistoning fold mirror for focus correction and the dms for other low - order aberrations , such as astigmatisms and comas .",
    "when carrying out planet discovery , photometry , and disk imaging , the hlc or spc relays an image of the high - contrast `` dark hole '' onto the imaging camera .",
    "a stationary polarizing beam splitter in front of the imaging camera separates the dark hole image into two orthogonal polarizations , whose two resulting images fill a small rectangular area of the detector .",
    "when taking planetary spectra , by contrast , the ifs images a regular grid of spectrally dispersed psfs onto the detector .",
    "several aspects of the ifs design@xcite further reduce the already very low - light level of the planet image from the coronagraph .",
    "the ifs separately collects spectra across the visible spectrum in three separately detected 18% wide sub - bands centered at 660 , 770 , and 890 nm . at the input of",
    "the ifs is a lenslet array used for spatial sampling the dark hole , where the psf sampling on the lenslet array is 3 @xmath1 3 lenslets per d ( psf core ) .",
    "a two - element prism spectrally disperses the psfs along a single axis , further spreading the light on the detector .",
    "thus , the very low expected photon count requires subelectron read noise , dark current , and clock induced charge ( cic ) to carry out planet spectroscopy .",
    "the formation of the grid of spectra on the detector is illustrated in fig .",
    "many astronomical instruments have used conventional charge coupled devices ( ccds ) , segmented ccds , or hybrid complementary metal oxide semiconductor ( cmos ) focal plane arrays@xcite . conventional ccds and hybrid",
    "vis / ir cmos@xcite devices have been the preferred focal plane arrays for both ground - based and space - based telescopes and visible / ir photometric instruments .",
    "conventional ccds have the advantage of being generally easier to characterize due to their extremely simple design .",
    "older ccds have less output taps and since noise increases with bandwidth , older ccds have higher read noise .",
    "more recent ccds have more output taps and are therefore less noisy and their primary source of noise is the output driver .",
    "the charge to voltage conversion in conventional ccds occurs on the gate capacitor of a metal oxide semiconductor field - effect transistor ( mosfet ) or junction gate field - effect transistor ( jfet ) , which is inherently nonlinear , but if running high - power supply voltages with low - voltage signal swings , ccds have linear response . in the design of ccds , conversion gain , output driver strength , and bandwidth",
    "are linked and so design optimization is limited .",
    "hybrid cmos detectors , owing to their complex design , can be difficult to characterize but do not suffer from noise due to either charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) or cic .",
    "the breed of cmos sensors used in astronomy  typically source follower pixels  has high gain in the pixel and is therefore generally limited by pixel noise and insensitive to read noise in the column buffer .",
    "source follower cmos pixels typically use a gate capacitor with a mosfet to convert charge to voltage and like ccds are inherently nonlinear .",
    "their response , however , is linear for most of the electron well range with nonlinearity for nearly empty and nearly full wells . in cmos sensor design ,",
    "the conversion gain , output driver strength , and bandwidth can be separately traded to optimize performance .    with the advent of the electron multiplying ccd ( emccd ) at the beginning of the last decade@xcite high signal to noise ( s / n ) performance became possible over much shorter timescales , resulting in negligible effective read noise and low spurious noise contribution .",
    "this performance is achieved by means of a multiplication register that lies after the conventional serial register where charge can be amplified by factors of thousands via avalanche multiplication .",
    "we explain this phenomenon in more detail in sec .",
    "2 . in this sense",
    ", emccds can outperform conventional ccds and are technologically mature since they are produced in medium volume as a commercial product for medical devices and for ground - based observatory instruments .",
    "nonetheless , emccds have little or no space flight heritage .    in order to fully assess the s",
    "/ n performance of the emccd and to compare with other candidate sensors having reasonably good performance but which may also have higher flight heritage and/or higher technological maturity , we carried out a trade study to compare the principal low - light level detector technologies . following a survey of such detectors , candidate technologies were selected for this study .",
    "these candidates were evaluated and ranked based on ( 1 ) compliance with performance requirements for the imager and ifs detectors , ( 2 ) flight heritage , ( 3 ) desired format and pixel pitch , and ( 4 ) planet yield predicted by a coronagraph model .",
    "the candidate detectors are [ in order of descending technology readiness level ( trl ) ] scientific ccds [ euclid , hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) and gaia ] , hybrid visible silicon imager ( jmaps ) , emccds , and scientific cmos detectors .",

    "a key advantage of scientific ccds is the availability of a mature deep depletion ( dd ) technology , which is based on the use of high - purity silicon in the detector to enable high quantum efficiency ( qe ) in the 800- and 900-nm wfirst - cgi bands .",

    "teledyne imaging sensors have developed a hybrid silicon cmos detector ( the hyvisi detector@xcite ) by interconnecting a visible silicon photodiode array to a cmos readout integrated circuit ( roic ) .",
    "hyvisi hybrids combine the high responsivity of silicon photodiodes with cmos parallel readout architecture , which provides unique capabilities . the correlated double sampling ( cds ) read noise of hyvisi is comparable to that of scientific ccds .",

    "such techniques are widely used in astronomy to reduce the contribution of reset and read noise .",
    "in addition , nondestructive read capability enables easy and accurate removal of cosmic rays ( crs ) while preserving signal . finally , since hyvisi detectors do not transfer charge through many pixels , they are not susceptible to deferred charge , which is one of the main limitations of scientific ccds exposed to high radiation environments .",

    "the device performance will be characterized before and after four separate proton doses in order to provide information on the rate of performance degradation throughout the 6-year lifetime .",
    "the results of phase ii testing will provide a worst - case test of radiation hardness , representing flight operation over 6 years without the benefit of in - flight warm cycling or any longer term annealing that may occur over time at this colder temperature .",

    "since the effects of radiation can greatly affect a device in different ways based on its operating conditions ( discussed later in sec . 6 ) , we conducted the phase i study as a survivability test for the ccd201 - 20 specifically for the wfirst - cgi .",
    "therefore , the sensor was run under higher gain conditions ( by a factor of 2 ) , for both high flux ( @xmath51600 e@xmath4 ) and low flux ( @xmath38 e@xmath4 ) signals , and for an integration times of 100 s. this test plan was important based on the disparate operating modes of the cgi . in phase ii , the ccd201 - 20 will be irradiated over the full range of proton fluences reflecting beginning of life ( bol ) to end of life ( eol ) for l2 , while kept at cryogenic temperatures in the beamline , where the device will be under power at all times in order to measure flat - band shifts as expected in flight .",

    "this is an extended multiplication stage containing a large - signal output that lies after the conventional serial register . in this region , electrons can be amplified by a process known as avalanche multiplication , in which high - voltage clocks produce electric fields in the silicon that are high enough to amplify charge via impact ionization .",
    "crucially , this process is inherently stochastic , where there is @xmath19 probability of an extra electron getting generated per electron per given multiplication stage .",
    "since a device can contain hundreds of multiplication stages , the probability of amplification becomes significant , and the subsequent em gain , g , can amplify the signal by factors of thousands :        @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the @xmath3@xmath22 probability of amplification and @xmath23 is the number of stages . the result is a much higher s / n , albeit at the proportional reduction in pixel charge handling capacity .",
    "it is important not to continuously saturate the device under high amplification , since this can reduce the lifetime of the em register .",

    "since the cic mechanism is believed to be due to holes escaping from traps at the surface and producing electrons by impact ionization given sufficient energy , the longer there is a high potential difference between two phases , the higher the probability that a hole will escape and be subjected to a higher field .",
    "it may be this time dependence that results in faster clocks producing less cic .",
    "importantly , as noted previously , any decreasing serial cti might contribute to apparent higher cic levels ; therefore , cti measurements for all clocking implementations will also be measured .",
    "these considerations become important for flight electronics , since higher readout rates are inherently more difficult to accommodate for flight , based on requisite components that are highly temperature and radiation sensitive ; these components are unique to a design that facilitates faster clocking .",
    "this work is ongoing .      since the total spurious noise in an emccd , which we define to be the contribution from dark current and cic ,",
    "can be amplified by the em register , it is the dominant source of noise since readout noise is suppressed under such amplification .",
    "as discussed previously , thermal excitation resulting in dark current can be greatly reduced by deep sensor cooling in addition to running the device in imo . however , since the cic can vary strongly as a function of clock swing , clock rise time as well as the device bias conditions ( in addition to waveshapes , as reported by daigle et al.@xcite ) , it is thus heavily dependent on the clocking process and how these parameters are designed in order to transfer charge.@xcite indeed , careful consideration of a device s clocking design also minimizes the cti . here , we show the different sources of noise inherent to an emccd , which must be considered in all performance modeling of such a device , and highlight these differences when compared to conventional devices .",
    "additionally , we outline the different operating modes and the importance of precision clock timing in order to reduce cti for the wfirst - cgi application .      evaluating the s / n in an emccd is much like that of a conventional ccd ; however , since there is a gain factor applied during the emccd amplification process , the equivalent readout noise , @xmath39 , is reduced by an amount @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is number of electrons and @xmath42 is the amplification gain .",
    "however , as previously outlined in sec .",
    "2 , there is an added variance in the signal , the enf , based on the stochastic nature of the process .",
    "therefore , when calculating the s4n for an emccd , the read noise becomes negligible but the enf and multiplication gain must be included , in addition to other standard parameters , such as the qe and the total signal in photoelectrons , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",

    "other factors such as charge persistence must be considered in such scenarios .",
    "persistence can occur when there is residual charge trapped in the surface or bulk regions of an emccd , and typically occurs if the device has been over - exposed to light such that the pixel charge capacity is exceeded .",
    "there are two main types of persistence , also known as `` residual image '' : ( 1 ) residual surface image ( rsi ) and ( 2 ) residual bulk image ( rbi ) .",
    "rsi can cause signal charge to get trapped in the si  so2 interface , which may persist at these positions and subsequently get released during a readout .",
    "charge trap lifetimes can be long and so persistence can be seen for hours or weeks after it occurs.@xcite however , the use of imo in the ccd201 eliminates surface trapped charge immediately by flooding the si  sio2 interface with holes ; therefore , the rsi component is eliminated . in parts of the ccd that are never inverted , such as the high - gain register",
    ", rsi is a potential issue .",
    "however , the high - gain register pixel well capacity is much larger than the image / store pixel well capacity , so it is unlikely that charge will ever reach the surface under normal , unbinned operation . in order to investigate potential damage or persistence effects",

    "once this condition has been fulfilled , holes migrate from the channel stops of the device to the semiconductor  insulator interface and populate the traps that are present due to the atomic mismatch between si and si  o2 . since the traps are populations with holes , dark current generation from this region is significantly reduced .",
    "therefore , imo is favored over nimo , and by using imo for the cgi application , which includes individual integration times of order 100 s of seconds and accumulated total integration times of several 1000 s , the dark current requirement of 5 @xmath1 10@xmath10 e@xmath4 pix@xmath6 sec@xmath6 can be achieved at and below temperatures of -85@xmath34 c. in flight , we expect the sensor to be passively cooled with active warming .",
    "although running the device in nimo can greatly reduce cic , as stated previously , dark current accumulation is likely too high in this mode .",
    "we would need to use temperatures of approximately 115@xmath34 c and below to sufficiently suppress the dark current in nimo ; however , under high gain , we are still investigating if temperatures in this range will cause increased cti . in the following section",

    "there is a minimum voltage that must be used in order to move charge in the parallel section ; however , as a result of the barrier implants described previously , a fixed potential is present in the silicon and any charge must overcome this static field in order to maintain sufficient device charge transfer . in recent work by gach et al.@xcite",

    "this reduction in implant dose will also mean a reduction in the fwc of the device ; however , a tradeoff between dose reduction and fwc is dependent on the application .",
    "this modification could also be applied to the ccd201 and might be considered if cic levels become problematic . additionally , increasing the number of multiplication elements ( @xmath23 ) would result in the same given gain factor ( @xmath42 ) being achieved by using a lower gate high voltage , since @xmath53 , as previously shown in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . by producing lower em gain",
    ", less impact ionization would occur due to lower electric fields thus reducing cic .",
    "the ccd201 has 604 multiplication elements in its standard design , and therefore this would require a further design change .",
    "another way of reducing parallel imo cic to nimo cic levels is via multilevel clocking of the image / store array ( see murray et al.@xcite for discussion of such clocking techniques ) . during an integration ,",
    "all of the clocks are held low enough with respect to v@xmath52 so that the image array is fully inverted . after this integration , but before the image to store transfer , the low rail of the image / store clocks is raised ( or alternatively , v@xmath52 is dropped ) enough so that the image / store array is taken out of inversion .",

    "cti can vary based on the vertical clocking frequency , wave shape , and horizontal frequency , in addition to the temperature of the device with high multiplication gain ( and because of radiation damage , see sec .",
    "indeed , by designing custom clock signals in an attempt to minimize other sources of noise , e.g. , cic , the cti can be adversely effected , see , e.g. , murray et al.@xcite and hall et al.@xcite the data presented in this section was produced by using the cccp version 3 controller,@xcite which has been designed to minimize both vertical and horizontal cti for photon counting applications that can yield cti of order @xmath31 @xmath1 10@xmath11 .",

    ", the ccd201 will undergo radiation damage in the wfirst orbit , and therefore a clocking design that is sufficient to deliver the required cti performance at bol might not be applicable as damage accrues over the mission lifetime .",
    "clocking strategies will therefore be required to identify damaged sites on the sensor , as well as additional techniques to mitigate this damage and/or maintain charge transfer quality under irradiated conditions .",

    "two main modifications were considered : ( 1 ) reducing the channel width of the device and ( 2 ) reducing the device s barrier implant dose .    a reduction in the channel width would reduce the charge store volume of the image and store sections .",
    "this would have the effect of reducing the amount of trapping sites that a charge cloud could interact with during readout , thus decreasing the cti .",
    "we note that discussions with e2v have suggested that this is considered to be a nontrivial design change .",
    "reducing the implant dose under phases 1 and 3 of the ccd201 would yield negligible levels of cic in the parallel section;@xcite however , a tradeoff between implant does reduction and a similar reduction in fwc must be considered .",

    "eper uses a flat field where the cte is estimated by measuring the amount of deferred charge found in the serial or parallel overscan regions , defined as the line region ( or `` extended pixel '' region ) .",
    "the technique is based on the sharpness of this edge and interpreting the results in terms of traps in the detector causing degradation of charge transfer .",
    "if charge transfer , as characterized by cti is poor , large amount of charge from the illumination get captured by traps and subsequently re - emitted when the charge cloud is transferred . the drop in signal",
    "is known as a `` deferred charge tail '' , which arises from this process .",
    "if the charge transfer was perfect , there would be no deferred charge , and a `` square wave '' edge would be present in the eper data . since traps result in some of the charge being deferred , instead of a perfectly square edge , there is a tail comprising charge that went through trapping / release during readout .",
    "cte , in this respect , is calculated as follows :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the deferred charge , @xmath76 is the charge in the last column read out , and @xmath77 is the number of pixel transfers .",
    "importantly , we note that the signal collected with each pixel passes through the conventional and em registers before the output , therefore the serial cti represents a combination of cti from both . by only using the eper method ,",

    "the results from the phase i radiation study are encouraging when comparing the bol and eol detector performance relative to the requirements for the cgi . based on current models that predict planetary yield as function of integration time , the most dominant sources of noise , or the performance parameters of the device that we must pay particular attention to , are dark current , cic , and cti . after annealing that followed the phase i radiation testing , we can report that the ccd201 measured dark current at operational temperatures of -108@xmath34 c ( imo ) passes the cgi requirement both before and after a ddd of 2.5 @xmath1 10@xmath57 protons cm@xmath16 , reflecting an eol dose in l2 for 10 mm of tantalum shielding . running at this temperature may affect the cti under high - gain conditions , and these effects are discussed in the material that follows .",
