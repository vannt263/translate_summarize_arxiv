    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is , apart from color confinement , the most important physical aspect of strong interactions .",
    "the fact that one observes mass splittings of chiral partners in the hadron spectrum and that pions have properties attributed to goldstone bosons strongly suggests that chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the vacuum .",
    "these , and other theoretical arguments @xcite , imply that in the vacuum there exists a chiral condensate giving rise to an expectation value of the bilinear fermionic operator @xmath1 .",
    "dynamical details of this phenomenon , which is inherently non - perturbative in nature , are part of the long standing problem of strong interactions , but in the course of time different model mechanisms for all its different aspects have been developed .    as temperature and/or baryon density is increased , thermal hadron excitations , because of their quark substructure , will affect the vacuum condensate causing its melting and eventually vanishing at the transition line to the chirally symmetric phase .",
    "microscopic quantification of this phenomenon comes from first principles lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations and confirms the intuitive predictions @xcite .    to get physical insight into this effect for low temperatures ( and densities ) one can use the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model @xcite , which was previously successfully applied to give a physical interpretation of lqcd data @xcite as well as a description of the abundances of particles produced in heavy ion collisions at very different center of mass energies @xcite in terms of freeze - out parameters .",
    "the assumption underlying this approach is that for conditions below the qcd transition line the system is composed of non - interacting hadronic degrees of freedom and so the partition function is that of an ideal mixture of free quantum gases . to have a reliable physical description of the system one needs to take into account all hadron resonances with masses up to @xmath2  gev .    to calculate the condensate in this framework",
    "it is necessary to know the dependence of hadron masses on the current quark masses .",
    "this , apart from the goldstone boson octet , is not straightforward to determine and either requires some assumptions about the underlying dynamics or is the result of a phenomenological fit .",
    "approaches , which can be regarded as based on first principles , are chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , lattice qcd simulations @xcite and dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) @xcite .",
    "they provide a consistent picture of hadrons with a reliable account of the quark mass dependence .",
    "however , in the chpt framework there are still large uncertainties concerning for example the nucleon strange sigma term @xcite for which , when different orders of approximation are considered , even the sign is not clear @xcite .",
    "this article explores the consequences of various hadron mass formulae proposed recently and compares them with the results mentioned above .",
    "one set of mass formulae which was used in the analysis reported here comes from a new model based on quark counting and is a generalization of what was proposed by leupold @xcite a few years ago . in leupold",
    "s scheme hadron masses were assumed to be linear in the current quark masses . this approach was used ( and generalized ) in @xcite . in the present work a further step is taken : it is assumed that the dependence of hadron masses on the current quark mass arises solely due to the dependence of constituent masses of valence quarks .",
    "the response of these constituent masses to the change in the current quark mass is determined based on the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite . in this way a fairly good description of the hadronic sigma terms is obtained .",
    "the only flaw is that the sea - quark contributions are neglected entirely , which , for example , leads to the vanishing of the nucleon strange sigma term .",
    "the second approach considered in this paper is the use of baryon mass formulae which were obtained in a large @xmath3 @xcite holographic model of qcd due to sakai and sugimoto @xcite .",
    "the last ten years have witnessed a lot of progress coming from gauge / gravity duality allowing for valuable insights into the dynamics of strongly coupled gauge theories .",
    "recent developments have made it possible to study in a quasi - analytical way theories which have very realistic properties .",
    "the spectrum of mesons and chiral symmetry breaking in the chiral limit was studied in @xcite and static baryon properties ( such as masses , magnetic moments or charge radii ) @xcite were found to be in qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "also form factors @xcite agree quite well with the data .",
    "further progress was made with the extension to finite current quark masses @xcite ( see @xcite for an alternative construction ) where for example gell - mann - oakes - renner relations for the pseudoscalar octet have been demonstrated .",
    "the impact of finite current quark masses on the spectrum of nucleon octet and delta decuplet baryons has been considered in the two flavor case @xcite and for @xmath0 flavors @xcite with nontrivial results .",
    "the leading order corrections are proportional to the squares of goldstone boson masses and determined in a similar way as the leading order of chpt @xcite .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the data and other theoretical expectations in the light quark sector , while the contribution of the strange quark is overestimated by the model .",
    "it is very likely that going beyond the leading order in the expansion in powers of the current quark masses will give more reasonable results ( as is the case in chpt ) . also , at leading order , vector mesons were argued not to receive mass corrections from finite current quark mass @xcite .",
    "the mass formulae obtained in @xcite make it possible to estimate sigma terms , including those for the nucleon octet and delta decuplet .",
    "this is then used to calculate the chiral condensate in the framework of the hrg model and the results are compared with calculations based on chiral perturbation theory .    in the context of dse studies",
    "@xcite sigma terms for the two light quark flavours have been considered .",
    "in addition to the nucleon and delta baryons also vector mesons were included .",
    "due to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings one gets a sigma term of the @xmath6-meson .",
    "the @xmath7-meson has no pion loop dressing and therefore only @xmath8 coupling remains . since in the dse approach strange sigma terms",
    "were not included yet we do not use these results as a base for calculating the chiral condensates of interest .",
    "we will only use it as a reference point to other calculations .",
    "the importance of hadronic contribution to the melting of the chiral condensate was appreciated in a model for the freeze - out stage of heavy - ion collisions , where it was related to the mott - anderson delocalisation of hadrons @xcite .",
    "the model is based on assumptions for hadron - hadron interactions and on the evolution of the matter formed in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the main point is that freeze - out phenomena are assumed to take place in the hadronic phase and are entirely attributed to the hadron dynamics . in general , each hadron is assigned a medium dependent radius @xmath9 , which is then related in a universal way to the chiral condensate .",
    "hadron - hadron reactions are described by the povh - hfner law @xcite and in consequence the cross section is determined by the medium dependence of the condensate .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the mean time between the interactions is getting larger , since it is inversely proportional to the reaction cross - section and hadron density ( in the _ relaxation time approximation _ ) . at some point",
    "the reaction rate becomes smaller than the rate of expansion and reactions between hadrons stop to change the final composition .",
    "the freeze - out parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are determined by the equality of both time scales .",
    "however in ref .",
    "@xcite only the light quark condensate was considered , so one of the possible improvements of the model is to include also the strange sector .",
    "this is one of the motivations for the present studies .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ hrgm ] the generic theoretical setup is described and the relevant quantities used in further calculations are defined .",
    "this section also reviews some thermodynamic quantities computed in the hrg model and highlights very good agreement with lattice computations .",
    "these considerations do not require any detailed assumptions about hadron dynamics .",
    "on the other hand , the computation of the chiral condensate strongly depends on hadron mass formulae expressed in terms of current quark masses as discussed in section [ condensate ] .",
    "this dependence is captured by the hadronic sigma terms . in section [ chpt ]",
    "we describe our baseline which are results obtained within chpt as the low energy effective theory of qcd . in section [ qwc ]",
    "hadron mass formulae based on their constituent quark structure are presented and contrasted with a previously established parametric dependence @xcite and with first principles results .",
    "section [ holo ] contains novel results following from the sakai - sugimoto holographic model together with a discussion in the light of lowest order chpt results .",
    "section [ conclusions ] contains conclusions , some discussion and possible open directions .",
    "the hadron resonance gas model implements the idea @xcite that qcd thermodynamics in the hadronic phase can be described as a multicomponent ideal hadron gas . for very low temperatures the dominant degrees of freedom are pions and kaons and due to the goldstone theorem their interactions are weak .",
    "therefore in the first approximation they can be considered as free particles .",
    "as the temperature and/or density is increased , contributions from heavier hadrons become important . because strong interactions are of finite range in the thermodynamical limit of infinite volume @xmath12 the grand canonical potential denotes the grand canonical potential as usually defined in statistical mechanics divided by the volume .",

    "there is clearly an excellent agreement for temperatures up to @xmath34  mev which means that the dominant effect in that range of temperatures comes from the excitation of hadronic degrees of freedom rather than from their interactions .",
    "this is a very well known effect @xcite .",
    "agreement for higher temperatures can be obtained when medium modifications of hadronic states are taken into account .",
    "for example in @xcite it was demonstrated that inclusion of state dependent hadronic width @xmath35 taken on the inverse collision time of the mott - anderson freeze - out @xcite and proper introduction of quark - gluon degrees of freedom based on the polyakov - loop extended nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model nicely reproduces lattice qcd data in the whole temperature range .",

    "qualitatively in the hrg model the increase for low temperatures is related to the appearance of a large number of light degrees of freedom .",
    "when heavier hadrons are exited , they contribute considerably to the energy density but almost nothing to the pressure , which leads to the characteristic dip . for high temperatures , because the number of states included is finite , there is an approximately constant behavior approaching the massless gas limit @xmath37 only for very high temperatures . on the other hand , for lqcd",
    "the dip is an indicator of the crossover transition . for a first order transition",
    ", the sound velocity should be strictly zero . for high temperatures lattice data approach the massless limit , which is consistent with the interpretation of deconfinement to a massless quark - gluon medium .",
    "the importance of the speed of sound for the phenomenology of heavy ion collisions was noticed , e.g. , by florkowski _",
    "@xcite in the context of the hbt puzzle .",
    "using the standard formula for the chiral condensate @xmath38 one obtains the quark - antiquark condensate in the light and strange flavor sector respectively @xmath39 @xmath40 the derivatives are taken with respect to the current quark masses and lead to the generic formulae @xmath41 @xmath42 where the scalar densities of mesons and baryons have been introduced as @xmath43 @xmath44 and the response of hadron masses to changes in the current quark mass of flavor @xmath45 is captured by the hadron sigma terms @xmath46 thus , for every hadron state , there are different sigma terms related to contributions from quark flavors constituting the hadron .",

    ". one can understand this hierarchy of condensates using the spectral representation of the expectation value for the quark of current mass @xmath51 @xcite @xmath52 and noting that the spectral integral is increasingly suppressed with the higher current quark mass , thus lowering the value of the quark condensate .",
    "furthermore , the characteristic length scale related to the quark - antiquark condensate can be taken as @xmath53 which is smaller for greater masses .",
    "this implies that the medium effect  expressed as screening length  will affect heavier quark condensates at higher temperatures .",
    "this can also be understood as arising from the fact that the contribution to the strange quark condensate  and its melting  comes from strange hadrons , which are fewer in number than hadrons containing light quarks .",
    "another important quantity , an approximate order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition , is the polyakov loop .",

    "good agreement with the lattice data was found in the temperature range @xmath54  mev@xmath55  mev .",
    "as explained above , the finite temperature behavior of chiral condensates in the hrg approach is determined by the sigma terms , which express the dependence of hadron masses on the current quark masses . a very important approach to this problem",
    "is provided by chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this approach is most effective in the pseudoscalar sector , since in the limit of vanishing quark masses these states are massless goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry . the importance of the chiral perturbation theory results for the sequel is twofold .",
    "firstly , in the following section they are used to compute sigma terms for the pseudo - goldstone bosons  the model introduced there is used for the remaining hadronic states .",
    "secondly , it is a natural point of reference for calculations carried out in section [ holo ] , where a detailed comparison with the holographic approach is described .    in the case of the goldstone boson octet the relevant mass formula is the gell - mann - oakes - renner ( gmor ) relation , which takes the form @xcite",

    "this paper was devoted to a discussion of the finite temperature behaviour of the chiral condensate within the hrg framework exploring different microscopic descriptions of the dependence of hadron masses on the current quark mass .",
    "in particular , a constituent quark scheme and holographic mass formulae have been used .",
    "it was also studied how the results are affected by including different numbers of states in the sums over resonances .",
    "it turns out that with a sensible choice of mass formulae and including hadron states with masses up to @xmath2  gev generic agreement with recent lattice results is obtained .",
    "this is yet another confirmation of the well known fact that for low temperatures the hrg model gives a satisfactory physical interpretation of lqcd data .",
    "chiral symmetry restoration in the strange sector was seen to take place at higher temperatures than in the light quark sector @xcite , which is related both to the lower number of strange hadrons contributing to the condensate as well as to the response of hadron masses to changes in the current strange quark mass .",
    "a generalization of the quark - counting approach of @xcite was proposed , and it was shown that the mass relations where only valence quarks of the hadron are taken into account already lead to a behaviour of the condensate which is close to what is seen in the full lattice data . in",
    "this scheme dynamically generated ( constituent ) quark masses are considered and their dependence on the current quark mass is quantified in the framework of the njl model .",
    "this step takes into account part of the non - perturbative qcd dynamics .",
    "the sea quark contributions are neglected resulting in a vanishing strange sigma term for the nucleon and a vanishing light quark contribution for the @xmath84 baryon .",
    "this is somewhat in the spirit of the large-@xmath3 expansion where quark loops are suppressed .",
    "along with this , a careful analysis of the hidden strange mesons has been performed based on the flavour symmetry structure of the mesons .",
    "this affects the simple quark counting rules used by @xcite , taking into account neglected effects which overestimated the light quark condensate and underestimated the strange quark condensate .",
    "another new aspect considered in this paper concerns the sigma terms and the condensate following from the mass formulae of the holographic model of qcd due to sakai and sugimoto @xcite .",
    "these formulae take on a form similar to the tree level chpt results with strange sigma terms overestimated due to the inaccuracy of the approximation for the relatively large value of @xmath68 .",
    "since those shifts were only calculated for the nucleon octet and delta decuplet baryons , the computation of the condensate is incomplete .",
    "this also shows the importance of heavier hadrons for temperatures near the qcd transition temperature .",
    "the results obtained here are of great importance in the context of hadron production under extreme conditions in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "recently , it has been conjectured that the behaviour of the chiral condensate determines the collision rates of hadrons and thus may provide a microscopic approach to the chemical freeze - out of hadron species @xcite .",
    "this approach , however , has yet been considered only in the light quark sector . including the strange quark condensate in that analysis",
