    "there are more than 150 different objects enumerated by catalan numbers ; @xcite contains an extensive list of such combinatorial objects and their properties .",
    "two of the most carefully studied ones are noncrossing partitions and permutations avoiding a 3-letter pattern .",
    "a partition @xmath4 of the set @xmath5 \\colon = \\{1,2,\\cdots , n\\}$ ] , having blocks @xmath6 , is called _ noncrossing _ if there are no four elements @xmath7 so that @xmath8 and @xmath9 for some distinct blocks @xmath10 and @xmath11 . the set of noncrossing partitions of @xmath5 $ ] constitutes a lattice under the refinement order ( where @xmath12 if each block of @xmath13 is a union of blocks of @xmath4 ) .",
    "an investigation of structural and enumerative properties of this lattice was initiated by kreweras @xcite , and continued by several authors , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we denote the lattice of noncrossing partitions of @xmath5 $ ] as @xmath14 , since it is a subposet ( indeed , a sub - meet - semilattice ) of the intersection lattice associated with the type - a hyperplane arrangement in @xmath15 ( which consists of the hyperplanes with equations @xmath16 , for @xmath17 ) . for our purposes , recall from @xcite that the poset @xmath14 is ranked with rank function @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 denotes the number of blocks of the partition @xmath4 ) , rank - symmetric and rank - unimodal with rank sizes given by the narayana numbers @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , it is self - dual ( see @xcite , @xcite ) and has the strong sperner property ( see @xcite ; that is , for every @xmath21 , the maximum cardinality of the union of @xmath21 antichains is the sum of the @xmath21 largest rank - sizes ) .    a permutation @xmath22 of @xmath5 $ ] , or , in what follows , an @xmath23-permutation , is called _ 132-avoiding _ if there are no three positions @xmath24 so that @xmath25 .",
    "classes of restricted permutations avoiding other patterns are defined similarly .",
    "such classes of permutations arise naturally in theoretical computer science in connection with sorting problems ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , as well as in the context of combinatorics related to geometry ( e.g. , the theory of kazhdan - lusztig polynomials @xcite and schubert varieties @xcite ) .",
    "the investigation of classes of pattern - avoiding permutations from an enumerative and algorithmic point of view includes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , to name a few .    in section [ sec -",
    "a ] of this paper we introduce the partially ordered set @xmath0 whose elements are the 132-avoiding @xmath23-permutations , ordered by @xmath26 if @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the descent set of a permutation .",
    "one can think of @xmath0 as a boolean algebra of rank @xmath29 in which each element @xmath30 is replicated as many times as there are 132-avoiding permutations with @xmath30 as the descent set .",
    "we show that this poset of restricted permutations is an extension of the lattice of noncrossing partitions @xmath14 by exhibiting a natural order - preserving bijection from the dual order @xmath31 to the poset @xmath0 .",
    "this yields the fact that @xmath0 has the same rank - generating function as @xmath14 ( implicit in @xcite , where the joint distribution of the descent and major index statistics on 132-avoiding permutations is shown to agree with the joint distribution of the block and rb statistic on noncrossing partitions ) .",
    "it then follows that @xmath0 is rank - unimodal , rank - symmetric and strongly sperner .",
    "we also prove that @xmath0 is itself a self - dual poset .",
    "we also present type - b analogues of these results .",
    "these constitute section [ sec - b ] of the paper .",
    "the notion of a type - b noncrossing partition of @xmath5 $ ] is that first considered by montenegro @xcite , systematically studied by reiner @xcite , and further investigated by hersh @xcite .",
    "these authors show that the type - b noncrossing partitions of @xmath5 $ ] form a lattice , @xmath32 , which shares naturally a variety of properties of @xmath14 . in particular",
    ", @xmath32 is a rank - unimodal , self - dual , strongly sperner poset .",
    "we define a poset @xmath1 into which @xmath32 can be embedded via an order - preserving bijection , with properties analogous to those obtained for type - a .",
    "the parallel between the type - a and type - b cases includes the fact that the poset @xmath1 is defined in terms of pattern - avoiding elements of the hyperoctahedral group ( or signed permutations ) , ordered by containment of the descent set .",
    "the relevant pattern restriction is the simultaneous avoidance of the patterns @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this class of restricted signed permutations was considered in @xcite , where b - analogues are proposed for type - a results in @xcite concerning combinatorial statistics for noncrossing partitions and restricted permutations .    in brief , a class of partitions and one of permutations are equinumerous , and further , the count of the partitions by number of blocks agrees with the count of permutations by number of descents .",
    "a similar situation arises for certain type - b analogues of these objects .",
    "our results show that these enumerative relations are manifestations of structural relations between partial orders which can be defined naturally on the objects under consideration .",
    "we also discuss posets @xmath2 and @xmath3 of restricted permutations and signed permutations ordered by containment of their sets of excedences .",
    "the final section of the paper consists of remarks and problems for further investigation .",
    "it is not difficult to find a bijection from the set of noncrossing partitions of @xmath5 $ ] onto that of 132-avoiding @xmath23-permutations . here",
    "we exhibit and analyze the structure of such a bijection , @xmath35 , which will serve as the main tool in proving the results of this section . to avoid confusion , integers belonging to a partition",
    "will be called _ elements _ , while integers belonging to a permutation will be called _",
    "entries_. an @xmath23-permutation will always be written in the one - line notation , @xmath36 , with @xmath37 denoting its @xmath38th entry .",
    "let @xmath39 .",
    "we construct the 132-avoiding permutation @xmath40 corresponding to it as follows .",
    "let @xmath21 be the largest element of @xmath4 which is in the same block of @xmath4 as 1 .",
    "put the entry @xmath23 of @xmath41 in the @xmath21th position , i.e. , set @xmath42 . as @xmath41 is to be 132-avoiding",
    ", this implies that the entries larger than @xmath43 are on the left of @xmath23 in @xmath41 , and the entries smaller than or equal to @xmath43 are on the right of @xmath23 .",
    "delete @xmath21 from @xmath4 and apply this procedure recursively , with obvious minor adjustments , to the restrictions of @xmath4 to the sets @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which are also noncrossing partitions .",
    "namely , if @xmath46 is the largest element in the same block as @xmath47 , we set @xmath48 , so that the restriction @xmath49 of @xmath4 to @xmath50 yields a 132-avoiding permutation of @xmath51 placed on the right of @xmath23 in @xmath52 . similarly , if in the restriction @xmath53 of @xmath4 to the set @xmath54 the largest element in the same block as 1 is equal to @xmath46 , we set @xmath55 .",
    "thus , recursively , @xmath53 yields a 132-avoiding permutation which we realize on the set @xmath56 and we place it to the left of @xmath23 in @xmath52 . in other words , with a slight abuse of notation , @xmath57 is the concatenation of @xmath58 , @xmath23 , and @xmath59 , where @xmath58 permutes the set @xmath60 and @xmath59 permutes the set @xmath61 $ ] .    to see that this is a bijection note that we can recover the maximum of the block containing the element 1 from the position of the entry @xmath23 in @xmath41 , and then proceed recursively .    _",

    "the statement is clearly true and we use induction on @xmath23 .",

    "proposition [ prop - block ] implies that @xmath0 is isomorphic to the order on noncrossing partitions in which @xmath84 if the set of minima of the blocks of @xmath85 is contained in the set of minima of the blocks of @xmath4 .",

    "suppose @xmath87 in @xmath14 .",

    "[ cor - syma ] the poset @xmath0 is rank - symmetric , rank - unimodal and strongly sperner , and its rank generating function is equal to that of @xmath14 .",
    "the properties of the rank sizes of @xmath0 are immediate consequences of proposition [ prop - block ] and the corresponding properties known to hold for @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , every antichain of @xmath0 is , via the bijection @xmath35 , an antichain of @xmath14 , and the strong sperner property of @xmath0 follows from the strong sperner property of @xmath14 .",
    "we now turn to showing that @xmath0 is self - dual , based on the next lemma .    for @xmath93 $ ] , let @xmath94 denote the number of 132-avoiding @xmath23-permutations with descent set @xmath30 .",

    "then we have @xmath102 and , because @xmath41 avoids the pattern 132 , the values of @xmath103 are _ consecutive _ integers .",

    "it is now easy to verify that the reverse complementation of the descent set can be used to construct an anti - automorphism of @xmath0 .",
    "the poset @xmath0 is self - dual .",
    "it is clear that , in @xmath0 , permutations which have the same descent set will cover the same elements and they will be covered by the same elements . the permutations with a prescribed descent set @xmath30 form an orbit of @xmath150 and they can be permuted among themselves arbitrarily by elements of @xmath150 .",
    "on the other hand , lemma [ lemma - rev - compl ] shows that the orbits corresponding to @xmath93 $ ] and to its reverse - complement @xmath115 are equinumerous .",
    "hence , a map @xmath151 which establishes a bijection between @xmath152 and @xmath153 for each @xmath154 $ ] provides an order - reversing bijection on @xmath0 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the joint distribution of the excedence and denert statistics on 321-avoiding permutations agrees with the joint distribution of the block and @xmath155 statistics on noncrossing partitions .",
    "this suggests the definition of the poset @xmath2 consisting of the 321-avoiding @xmath23-permutations ordered by containment of the set of excedences , and invites the question of how @xmath2 compares with the poset @xmath0 .",
    "a permutation @xmath156 has an _ excedence _ at @xmath38 if @xmath157 .",
    "for example , the _ excedence set _ of @xmath158 is @xmath159 .",
    "let @xmath160 denote the number of excedences of @xmath156 .",
    "following @xcite , there is a bijection @xmath161 from @xmath162 to 321-avoiding @xmath23-permutations such that @xmath163 .",
    "namely , if the set of minima of the blocks of @xmath39 , omitting the block containing 1 , is @xmath164 and the set of maxima of the blocks , again , omitting the block containing 1 , is @xmath165 , then let @xmath166 be the permutation whose value at @xmath167 is @xmath168 for @xmath169 , and whose other values constitute an increasing subsequence in the remaining positions .",
    "for instance , if @xmath170 , then we have @xmath171 and @xmath172 , and we obtain @xmath173 .    recall from @xcite that the set of excedences of @xmath166 is precisely @xmath174 .",
    "similarly to the case of descents discussed for 132-avoiding permutations , a covering relation @xmath175 in @xmath14 corresponds to the deletion of an excedence : @xmath176 , for a suitable @xmath177 .",
    "hence , taking advantage of the self - duality of @xmath14 , one can establish directly that the poset @xmath2 enjoys the same properties as @xmath0 : there is an embedding of @xmath14 into the poset @xmath2 of 321-avoiding @xmath23-permutations ordered by containment of the set of excedences ; the embedding is rank - preserving and @xmath2 is a strongly sperner poset .",
    "the fact that the posets @xmath0 and @xmath2 have strongly similar properties is not accidental .",
    "[ prop - isoa ] the posets @xmath0 and @xmath2 are isomorphic .    for each @xmath93 $ ] , let @xmath178 be the set of 321-avoiding @xmath23-permutations with excedence set @xmath179 $ ] .",
    "let also @xmath180 be the set of 132-avoiding @xmath23-permutations with descent set equal to @xmath115 , the reverse - complement of @xmath30 .",

    "for example , for @xmath244 we have @xmath245 .",
    "it is then transparent that if @xmath246 , then its descent set is precisely the set of positions occupied by barred symbols . in conclusion ,    [ obs - bij - b2121 ] for an element @xmath241 of the hyperoctahedral group @xmath201 , let @xmath247 denote the set of symbols which are barred in @xmath241 , and @xmath242 denote the descent set of @xmath241 .",
    "then the map @xmath248 gives a bijection between the class of restricted signed permutations @xmath249 and ordered pairs of subsets of @xmath5 $ ] of equal cardinality .      as the b - analogue of the poset of 132-avoiding permutations @xmath0 of the preceding section , we consider the poset @xmath1 consisting of the @xmath250-avoiding elements of the hyperoctahedral group @xmath201 , with the order relation given by @xmath251 if and only if @xmath252 .",
    "based on the preceding discussion and an encoding of type - b noncrossing partitions appearing in @xcite , one readily obtains the properties of @xmath1 which parallel those of @xmath0 .",
    "the poset @xmath1 of @xmath253-avoiding elements of the hyperoctahedral group @xmath201 , ordered by containment of the descent set , is an extension of the refinement order on the type - b noncrossing partition lattice @xmath32 .",
    "the poset @xmath1 has the same rank - generating - function as @xmath32 , therefore it is rank - symmetric and rank - unimodal , and it is a self - dual and strongly sperner poset .",
    "it is immediate from its definition and observation [ obs - bij - b2121 ] that @xmath1 is a ranked poset ( namely , @xmath254 ) and has rank - sizes given by @xmath255 , equal to the rank - sizes in @xmath32 .",
    "also , @xmath1 is a self - dual poset : clearly , if @xmath256 is the @xmath250-avoiding signed permutation which corresponds to the pair @xmath257 - l(b ) , [ n ] - { \\rm des}(b ) ) $ ] , then the mapping @xmath258 is an order - reversing involution on @xmath1 .    toward checking",
    "that there is an order - preserving bijection from @xmath32 to @xmath1 , we first recall a fact from @xcite : every partition @xmath259 can be encoded by a pair @xmath260 of subsets of @xmath5 $ ] whose cardinality is the number of pairs of non - zero blocks of @xmath4 . informally , these sets consist of the left and right delimiters of non - zero blocks when the elements are read in clockwise order ( in the circular diagram of @xmath4 ) .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath261 or if @xmath4 has only a zero - block , we set @xmath262 . otherwise , @xmath259 has some non - zero block consisting of cyclically consecutive elements in its diagram .",
    "if such a block consists of @xmath263 in clockwise order , then @xmath264 belongs to @xmath265 and @xmath266 belongs to @xmath267 . by deleting this block and its image under barring , a type - b noncrossing partition of @xmath61 $ ]",
    "is obtained and the construction of the sets @xmath265 and @xmath267 is completed by repeating this process as long as non - zero blocks arise . for instance , if @xmath268 , then @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath175 in @xmath32 , and that this is a covering relation ( i.e. , @xmath271 )",
    ". then there exist @xmath272 and @xmath273 such that @xmath274 and @xmath275 , as a result of the merging of blocks entailed by the covering relation .",
    "thus it is clear that if @xmath259 is mapped to the signed permutation @xmath276 with the property that @xmath277 , then one obtains an order - reversing embedding of @xmath32 into @xmath1 . combining this with the self - duality of @xmath1 we obtain the desired embedding of @xmath32 into @xmath1 .",
    "finally , the strong sperner property of @xmath1 follows as in type a , from the strong sperner property of @xmath32 ( see @xcite ) and the rank - preserving embedding of @xmath32 into @xmath1 .      as in the type - a case , there is a self - dual poset of @xmath278 restricted signed permutations ordered by containment of the set of excedences .",
    "in fact , there is more than one definition of the excedence statistic in the literature , in the case of the hyperoctahedral group .",
    "we briefly mention two possibilities considered in @xcite .    given a signed permutation @xmath241 , let @xmath21 be the number of symbols which are _ not _ barred in @xmath241 .",
    "we associate to @xmath241 an @xmath279-permutation @xmath280 by setting @xmath281 and , for @xmath204 , letting @xmath282 if @xmath283 is the @xmath46th smallest among the symbols @xmath284 with respect to the linear ordering @xmath285 .",
    "for example , if @xmath286 , then @xmath287 .",
    "now , the excedence set of @xmath241 is defined to be that of @xmath280 .",
    "it turns out @xcite that for @xmath288 this definition makes the excedence set coincide with the descent set for each @xmath241 .",
    "therefore , this leads to the poset @xmath1 again .",
    "an alternative definition for excedences of `` indexed permutations '' appears in @xcite .",
    "specialized to the hyperoctahedral group it is the following .",
    "[ def - bexc2 ] if @xmath289 , its _ excedence set _ is the union of the sets @xmath290 and @xmath291 , where @xmath290 is the set of excedences computed in the symmetric group for the permutation @xmath292 obtained by removing all bars from the symbols in @xmath241 , and @xmath293 , the set of barred fixed points of @xmath241 .",
    "thus , for @xmath294 we obtain excedences at @xmath295 by either of the two definitions . but",
    "@xmath296 has excedences at @xmath297 by the first definition ( based on @xmath298 ) , and @xmath299 if the second definition is adopted .    for the remainder of this section",

    "let @xmath3 denote the poset of @xmath250-avoiding signed permutations in @xmath201 , ordered by containment of their excedence set .",
