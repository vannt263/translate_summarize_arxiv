    "models of dna sequence evolution have generally treated sequences as collections of independently evolving sites@xcite .",
    "however , there is a substantial amount of evidence from sequence analysis and studies of mutation rates@xcite which suggests that the identities of neighboring bases can have a strong influence on the types and rates of mutational events which occur at a given sequence position .",
    "we briefly review these types of evidence before describing a model which explicitly accounts for neighbor - dependent mutations .",
    "biochemical studies in the early 1970s compared the pattern of dinucleotide odds ratios ( dinucleotide frequencies normalized for the base composition ) or `` general designs '' of different genomes and different fractions of genomic dna@xcite and concluded that this pattern is a remarkably stable property of a genome which is largely preserved in closely related genomes or in different renaturation rate fractions of the same genome , for example .",
    "some two decades later , a significant body of sequence analysis work primarily by karlin and coworkers@xcite has elaborated and expanded on these observations , showing that the pattern of dinucleotide relative abundance values ( essentially equivalent to the general design ) constitutes a `` genomic signature '' in the sense that it is remarkably constant across different parts of a genome and is generally similar between related organisms , but quite different between distantly related organisms .",
    "this latter finding has led to application of this principle to phylogeny reconstruction and identification of laterally transferred genes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms .",
    "although quite promising , this line of work is open to the criticism that there is no underlying theory for why a genome should possess a particular signature or the mechanism by which signatures change over long periods of time .",
    "the model described here may help to provide a theoretical framework for interpreting these and related observations .",
    "our analysis may also contribute to understanding of the mechanisms of dna mutation and repair and may help in the development of better methods for phylogenetic tree construction .",
    "possible factors relating to the genome signature include effects related to dna structure , base stacking and thermodynamics as well as a variety of mutational factors .",
    "since the genome signature is particularly pronounced in non - coding sequences which are typically under much less selective pressure than coding regions and evolve much more rapidly , it appears likely that `` nonselective '' forces such as biases related to mutation , replication and dna repair account for many of the properties of the genome signature , especially in higher eukaryotic organisms with large genomes containing mostly non - coding dna and relatively small effective population sizes .",
    "one of the most common types of mutation in vertebrate genomes is  methylation followed by deamination and mutation of /  to /  @xcite .",
    "for example , wang _",
    "et al._@xcite found that single - nucleotide polymorphisms occur approximately tenfold more often at  dinucleotides than at other dinucleotides in human genomic dna , suggesting that this is by far the most common type of single base mutation in humans .",
    "this is in agreement with the earlier finding by batzer _ et .",
    "al._@xcite and hess _ et .",
    "al._@xcite that point substitutions occur 10 times more frequently at  sites compared to non-  sites . increased mutation rate associated with  methylation can explain at least qualitatively why  dinucleotides have consistently extremely low relative abundance values in all vertebrate nuclear genomes@xcite .",
    "this effect was recently exploited by fryxell and zuckerkandl@xcite in their theory of the origin of genomic isochores in mammals .    here",
    "we consider a model for dna sequence evolution which includes neighbor - dependent mutation effects .",
    "efficient computational tools are constructed to solve the model for arbitrary user - specified mutation processes and rates .",
    "the main results are quantitative answers to ( 1 ) the long term effects of neighbor - dependent mutations on the base compositional structure of a genome , and ( 2 ) the underlying mutation processes and rates given sequence data with dinucleotide correlations . in principle",
    ", such a model should be able to account for the effects of -methylation induced mutation and several other known contextual effects on mutation rates . however , in order to preserve the tractability of the model , certain other types of mutations which occur in nature had to be ignored .",
    "for example mutations which change the lengths of dna sequences ( insertions and deletions such as those caused by polymerase slippage ) or more complex mutations such as inversions or other large - scale rearrangements are not considered .",
    "nevertheless , the current model is a reasonable first approximation to dna sequence evolution in the absence of selection .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .  2",
    ", we introduce our model of sequence evolution with neighbor - dependent mutation , and define the mutation rate matrices . in sec .  3",
    ", we describe the general scheme used to calculate the single and dinucleotide frequencies , and present the pattern of dinucleotide odds ratio obtained for a particular example involving the -methylation - deamination process described above .",
    "we also present the backward analysis , where a maximum likelihood approach is used to _ infer _ the mutation rates from the observed dinucleotide frequencies within the confines of our model .",
    "a web server is made available for the public to perform these calculations at http://bioinfo.ucsd.edu/dinucleotides . in sec .  4 , we list some of a large number of studies made possible by the method described here .",
    "details of the method are relegated to the appendix .",
    "we consider a sequence of @xmath0 nucleotides @xmath1 with @xmath2 . the configuration at time @xmath3",
    "is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "there are two types of mutation processes allowed : ( 1 ) mutations of a single nucleotide @xmath5 which occurs with a rate @xmath6 independent of its neighbors , and ( 2 ) mutations of a pair of neighboring nucleotides @xmath7 which occurs with a rate @xmath8 .",
    "these rates are positive numbers and fixed in time .",
    "we start with an initial random sequence @xmath9 .",
    "the dynamics of the model is markovian . at any time @xmath3",
    ", the sequence @xmath10 is updated in discrete time steps @xmath11 according to the following update rules :    1 .   a position @xmath12 is chosen at random between @xmath13 and @xmath0 ; 2 .",
    "the nucleotide @xmath14 from the sequence @xmath15 is mutated to @xmath16 with @xmath17 to generate an intermediary sequence @xmath18 ; 3 .   a pair of neighboring positions @xmath19 and",
    "@xmath20 is chosen at random between @xmath13 and @xmath0 ; 4 .",
    "the nucleotides @xmath21 from the sequence @xmath18 are mutated to @xmath22 with @xmath23 to generate the new sequence @xmath24 .    to guarantee the conservation of the transition probabilities , the rates",
    "must be chosen such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the time increment @xmath27 should be chosen such that all non - diagonal transition probabilities in eqs .",
    "( [ rulei ] ) and ( [ ruleii ] ) are small ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "then after @xmath0 such iterations , on average every base in the sequence @xmath10 is mutated with probability @xmath29 , corresponding to a net increment of time by @xmath27 .",
    "the above procedure is then repeated for a long time until the _ stationary state _ is reached . since the model is ergodic , the stationary state is unique .",
    "we denote the probability to find a configuration @xmath30 in the stationary state by @xmath31 .",
    "we refer to rates @xmath32 and @xmath33 collectively as the mutation matrix @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "there are a total of 12 independent rates @xmath32 and 240 independent rates @xmath33 .",
    "note that in the special case of neighbor - dependent single nucleotide mutation , e.g. , the -methylation - deamination process described in sec .  1",
    ", @xmath35 is given by a _ restricted _ form with @xmath33 non - zero only if @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "there are still 96 independent rates under this restriction . for non - coding dna sequences , mutations on the complementary dna strand should generally occur at the same rate as on the forward strand .",
    "we therefore expect a _ reverse complementary symmetry _ in the rates , i.e. , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the complement of @xmath41 , e.g. @xmath42 .",
    "these complementarity conditions reduce the number of independent parameters by another factor of two .",
    "note however that for the calculation to be presented below , it is not necessary to impose any of these conditions on @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "the subject of this study is the stationary probability distribution @xmath31 for the mutation processes characterized by the rates @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "if each nucleotide position evolves independently of each other , i.e. , if @xmath43 , then the distribution factorizes , with @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is given by the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath34 .",
    "however , for @xmath46 , the bases in the sequence do not evolve independently and the stationary distribution is difficult to calculate .",
    "instead , we focus on the single nucleotide frequencies ( or the `` base composition '' ) and the dinucleotide frequencies , given by @xmath47 @xmath48 respectively .",
    "an important motivation for computing these frequencies is that they are easily measured from actual sequence data@xcite and can thus be used for quantitative comparison with the output of our model .",
    "our first goal is to compute the frequencies @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the stationary state for any set of mutation rates @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "exact solution of these quantities is still difficult because in order to compute the dinucleotide frequencies , one needs to know the trinucleotide frequencies @xmath51 , etc . , ending up with an infinite hierarchy of equations .",
    "this is a frequently encountered problem in coupled dynamical systems .",
    "here we introduce an approximation procedure called the `` two - cluster approximation '' which is well - known from nonlinear dynamics@xcite .",
    "this procedure truncates the hierarchy of equations , expressing the trinucleotide frequencies as a function of the single and dinucleotide frequencies , i.e. , @xmath52 and then solves for the dinucleotide frequencies simultaneously .",
    "the procedure gives the exact solution if the stationary state of the mutation process @xmath35 is a first - order markov chain ; it is generally very accurately as long as the sequence correlation in the stationary state is short - ranged .",
    "comparison of solutions obtained using this method with the best numerical estimate from monte - carlo simulation yielded relative disagreement well below the @xmath53 level ; see below .",
    "thus , for practical purposes , we can regard the cluster approximation as generating `` exact '' results .",
    "the advantage of using the cluster approximation ( instead of monte - carlo simulation ) is that the single and dinucleotide frequencies can be computed virtually instantaneously by numerically solving a set of algebraic equations for _ arbitrary _ mutation matrices @xmath34 and @xmath35 , i.e. , without any constraints on the rates .",
    "we have developed a web server at http://bioinfo.ucsd.edu/ dinucleotides to perform this calculation .",
    "we will present our method here via a specific example , the -methylation - deamination process described in the introduction .",
    "this process is described by a single neighbor - dependent mutation rate , i.e. @xmath54 and @xmath55 for all other nondiagonal entries . to make this example transparent",
    ", we also consider a simplified version of the neighbor - independent mutation rate @xmath34 , adopting a single rate @xmath56 for all transitions and another rate @xmath57 for all transversions , i.e. , @xmath58    for this simple case , the single and dinucleotide frequencies can be solved analytically in _ closed form _ under the two - cluster approximation as described in the appendix .",
    "note that since the stationary state does not involve any time scale in itself , the results only depend on two effective parameters , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the transition / transversion ratio has been estimated to be @xmath61 previously , based on mammalian pseudogene studies@xcite . combined with the observed 10-fold difference@xcite in point substitution counts between  and non-  sites [ which implies @xmath62",
    ", we obtain @xmath63 for mammals .",
    "the nucleotide frequencies computed according to these rates are shown in table  [ tabappx ] .",
    "they compare very well to the results of monte - carlo simulation : the latter performed for an @xmath64 system ( and averaged over 100 simulations ) yielded results that were within an rms deviation of @xmath65 in the single - nucleotide frequencies and @xmath66 in the dinucleotide frequencies .",

    "we have introduced a model of neighbor - dependent mutation and developed methods to study these processes which are believed to play an important role in the evolution of genomic sequences .",
    "we see that the base composition and the dinucleotide frequencies are strongly influenced by neighbor - dependent mutation .",
    "this may contribute to the ( surprising ) success of phylogenetic analysis based on dinucleotide counts@xcite , since the pattern of dinucleotide frequencies reflect the mutation mechanisms and rates which should be highly conserved throughout evolution .",
    "a similar mutation model was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite using monte carlo simulations . in that work ,",
    "the backward analysis required a number arbitrary assumptions and large amounts of computer time .",
    "our work represents a systematic approach to these studies .",
    "the analysis tools we provide enable the users to examine a large number of mutation processes and rates in detail and over a large number of genomes , to look for previously unknown mutation processes and track them across the different kingdoms of life .",
    "of course , the mutation model ( i.e. , eqs .  ( [ rulei ] ) and ( [ ruleii ] ) ) and the assumption of stationarity for observed sequences need to be verified quantitatively .",
    "but the present method is in fact not limited to the study of the stationary state , and can be straightforwardly extended to describe the evolution towards stationarity@xcite .",
    "this can be used to extend the traditional phylogenetic analysis@xcite to include neighbor - dependent effects , and should be particularly useful for the vertebrates which are dominated by the -methylation - deamination process .",
    "finally we note that a more accurate description of the evolution of non - coding genomic dna sequences will be of value to various sequence analysis applications , particularly those involving mammalian genomes .",
    "for instance , in the comparative genomics approach to gene and dna motif finding , one needs to evaluate the probability of spurious matches due to shared common ancestry in the non - coding regions@xcite .",
    "accurate evaluation of such probabilities depend critically on having realistic models of sequence evolution , which this study contributes towards .",
