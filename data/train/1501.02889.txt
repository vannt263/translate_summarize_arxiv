    "current cellular communication systems operate in half - duplex ( hd ) mode by transmitting and receiving either at different time slots or over different frequency bands .",
    "the system is designed in such a way that the downlink ( dl ) and uplink ( ul ) traffics are structurally separated by time division duplexing ( tdd ) or frequency division duplexing ( fdd ) .",
    "the advantage of such design principle is that it avoids the high - powered self - interference that is generated during simultaneous transmission and reception .",
    "recent results  @xcite , however , have demonstrated the feasibility of _ full - duplex _ ( fd ) wireless communication by suppressing or cancelling self - interference in the rf and baseband level .",
    "various practical designs to realize self - interference cancellation have been proposed in the literature , including adding additional antennas  @xcite , adding auxiliary transmit rf chains  @xcite or auxiliary receive rf chains  @xcite , using polarization  @xcite , employing balun circuits  @xcite , and many more . for more details , see  @xcite and the references therein .    by enabling simultaneous transmission and reception , fd radio",
    "is expected to double the spectral efficiency of current hd systems  @xcite , and is considered as one of the key technologies for next generation communication systems .",
    "evidently , in situations where the base station ( bs ) and the user simultaneously transmit bidirectionally as shown in figure  [ fig : first ] , enabling fd doubles the overall spectral efficiency .",
    "this point - to - point bidirectional communication example , however , is just one instance of how a fd cellular system will function .    in some practical cases",
    ", the system may have to support hd users which do not have fd radio due to extra hardware burden on mobile devices .",
    "in such case , the fd bs can simultaneously communicate with two sets of users , one receiving dl data from the bs and the other transmitting ul data to the bs ( figure  [ fig : second ] ) . in another configuration shown in figure  [ fig : third ] , for instance ,",
    "when the bs has many more antennas compared to each user , the fd bs may wish to simultaneously communicate with multiple fd users using multi - user multiple - input and multiple - output ( mimo ) techniques .",
    "since the bs is simultaneously transmitting and receiving , there is potential to double the overall spectral efficiency compared to the conventional hd only systems .",
    "however , the configurations shown in figures  [ fig : second ] and [ fig : third ] induce a new source of interference that does not arise in hd only networks . in figure",
    "[ fig : second ] , since user 1 is transmitting to the bs while user 2 is receiving from the bs , the transmission from user 1 causes interference to user 2 . similarly , in figure  [",
    "fig : third ] , the ul transmission of the users causes interference to the dl reception to each other . in cases where this type of interference is strong and proper interference mitigation techniques",
    "are not applied , the gain of having fd radios can be severely limited even when self - interference is completely removed .    to manage inter - user interference and fully utilize wireless spectrum with fd operation , in this paper",
    "we employ signal space _ interference alignment _ ( ia ) schemes optimized for fd networks including the cases in figure 1 .",
    "initially proposed by the seminar works in @xcite , ia is a coding technique that efficiently deals with interference and is known to achieve the optimal dof for various interference networks  @xcite . especially , it is shown that ia can be successfully applied to mitigate interference in various cellular networks , such as two - cell cellular networks  @xcite and multiantenna ul ",
    "dl cellular networks  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the idea of ia can also be applied to the ( multi - user ) bidirectional cellular network with ergodic phase fading  @xcite , in which the achievable scheme is based on the ergodic ia scheme proposed in @xcite .",
    "motivated by the aforementioned previous works related to ia , we propose the optimal transmission schemes that attain the optimal sum dofs for two configurations : 1 ) a cellular network with a multiantenna fd bs and hd users ( figure  [ fig : second ] ) ; 2 ) a cellular network with a multiantenna fd bs and fd users ( figure  [ fig : third ] ) .",
    "the key idea of the proposed schemes is to carefully allocate the ul and dl information streams using ia and beamforming techniques .",
    "the ul data is sent to the bs using ia such that the inter - user interference is confined within a tolerated number of signal dimensions , while the bs transmits in the remaining signal dimensions via zero - forcing beamforming for the dl transmission .    with the proposed schemes , our primary goal is to answer whether if fd operation can still double the overall spectral efficiency even in the presence of inter - user interference .",
    "we answer this question by providing matching upper bounds with the proposed achievable schemes , completely characterising the sum dofs of the considered networks . as a consequence of the result , even in the presence of inter - user interference , we show that the overall dof can approach the two - fold gain over hd only networks when the number of users becomes large as compared to the number of antennas at the bs .",
    "we further provide the dof gain of the fd systems by considering various configurations ( see sections iii and vi . ) .      in  @xcite , cadambe and jafar",
    "proposed a novel interference management technique called _ interference alignment _",
    "( ia ) , which achieves the optimal sum dof of @xmath0 for the @xmath1-user interference channel ( ic ) with time - varying channel coefficients .",
    "in addition , for the case in which all channel coefficients are constant , motahari et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a different type of ia scheme based on number - theoretic properties of rational and irrational numbers and showed that the optimal dof of @xmath0 is also achievable .",
    "later , alternative methods of aligning interference in the finite signal - to - noise regime has been also proposed in @xcite .",
    "the concept of ia has been successfully adapted to various network environments , e.g. , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the dof of cellular networks has been first studied by suh and tse for both ul and dl environments , where inter - cell interference exists  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , for two - cell networks having @xmath1 users in each cell , the sum dof of @xmath2 is achievable for both ul and dl .",
    "thus , multiple users at each cell are beneficial for improving the dof of cellular networks .",
    "these models were further extended to more general cases in terms of the number of users and the number of antennas at each bs @xcite .",
    "in addition , recently , the dof of the multiantenna ul  dl cellular network consisting of dl and ul cells has been studied in @xcite . for a cellular network with fd operation in the absence of self - interference , the dof of",
    "the ( multi - user ) bidirectional case has been studied in  @xcite for ergodic phase fading setting .",

    "<S> we study the case when _ half duplex ( hd ) users _ , partitioned to either the uplink ( ul ) set or the downlink ( dl ) set , simultaneously communicate with the fd bs . in the second scenario , </S>",
    "<S> we study the case when _ fd users _ simultaneously communicate ul and dl data with the fd bs . </S>",
    "<S> unlike conventional hd only systems , inter - user interference ( within the cell ) may severely limit the dof , and must be carefully taken into account . with the goal of providing theoretical guidelines for designing such fd systems , we completely characterize the sum dof of each of the two different fd cellular networks by developing an achievable scheme and obtaining a matching upper bound . the key idea of the proposed scheme is to carefully allocate ul and dl information streams using interference alignment and beamforming techniques . by comparing the dofs of the considered fd systems with those of the conventional hd systems , </S>",
    "<S> we establish the dof gain by enabling fd operation in various configurations . as a consequence of the result </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the dof can approach the two - fold gain over the hd systems when the number of users becomes large enough as compared to the number of antennas at the bs .    cellular network , degrees of freedom , full duplex , interference alignment , multiantenna technique . </S>"
