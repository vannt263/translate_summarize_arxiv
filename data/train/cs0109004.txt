    "the lattice field theory group at the zhongshan university has faced the familiar pressures of trying to balance the need for increased computational power against the constraints of an academic research budget .",
    "the group s primary research interest is in lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the study of quark interactions .",
    "this field lends itself well to numerical simulation , but requires significant computational resources for forefront research .",
    "traditionally this has been the domain of supercomputers .",
    "however , in recent years , advances in technology and falling hardware prices have blurred the distinction between the definition of a supercomputer and personal computer .",
    "desktop machines of today are far more powerful than the supercomputers of yesteryear .",
    "a further development is that the fastest computers today are in fact parallel computers , with multiple processors working together on a problem .",
    "parallel computation has its limitations , the biggest being that it is applicable only to problems that can be divided into concurrent tasks .",
    "furthermore , since communication between processors is usually the slowest part of the computation , the separate tasks should ideally be as independent as possible .",
    "fortunately many computational physics problems , including lattice qcd , fall into the category of parallelizable problems .",
    "indeed , many computational problems in the commercial world are suitable for this type of computation as well",
    ". applications of parallel computation include graphics and animation , telecommunications and internet service , and many other fields heavily reliant on computer processing .",
    "it is possible to join multiple cheap , fast pc type computers to build a parallel `` supercomputer '' with an arbitrarily high aggregate speed . a cluster of this type",
    "is called a `` beowulf cluster '' @xcite and the idea was pioneered by the united states national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "one big advantage of a pc cluster over other types of supercomputers is the low cost and easy availability of the hardware components .",
    "all the hardware in our cluster is available at retail computer suppliers .",
    "this gives great flexibility in both building and the cluster and in any future upgrades or expansions we may choose to make .",
    "our cluster consists of ten pc type computers , each with two 500 mhz pentium iii processors inside .",
    "the logic behind dual cpu machines is that one can double the number of processors without the expense of additional , cases , power supplies , motherboards , network cards , et cetera . also , the inter - node communication speed is faster for each pair of processors in the same box as compared to communication between separate computers .",
    "each computer has an 8 gb eide hard drive , 128 mb of memory , a 100mbit / s ethernet card , a simple graphics card a floppy drive and a cdrom . in practice",
    "the cdrom , the floppy drive , and even the graphics card could be considered extraneous , as all interactions with the nodes could be done through the network . however , with these components , all of which are relatively cheap in comparison to the total cost , the operating system installation and occasional maintenance is significantly easier .",
    "one computer has a larger hard disk ( 20 gb ) , and a scsi card for interaction with a tape drive .",
    "for the entire cluster we have only one console consisting of a keyboard , mouse and monitor .",
    "a fast ethernet switch handles the inter - node communication .",
    "the switch has 24 ports so there is ample room for future expansion of the cluster to up to a total of 48 processors .",
    "of course it is possible to link multiple switches or use nodes with more that two processors , so the possibilities for a larger cluster are nearly limitless .",
    "the layout of the cluster is illustrated in figure [ fig : a ] .",
    "the cluster runs on the linux operating system .",
    "linux is powerful and inexpensive .",
    "it easily supports important features like multiple processors .",
    "it allows the configuration of a network file server .",
    "we have mounted the largest hard disk on to all of the machines in the cluster .",
    "each machine can read and write to it as if it were physically part of that computer .",
    "linux also supports a network information system to share user accounts across the entire cluster .",
    "one uses the same account and home directory , no matter which machine he or she logs into .",
    "standard linux distributions also supply c , c++ , and fortran compilers",
    ".    we can use the the cluster for parallel processing by using the message passing interface ( mpi)@xcite , a library of communication functions and programs that allow for communication between processes on different cpus . the programmer must design the parallel algorithm so that it appropriately divides the task among the individual processors .",
    "he or she must then include message passing functions in the code which allow information to be sent and received by the various processors .",
    "mpi is one of the most popular standards for message passing parallel programming , and is widely used in the physics community .",
    "therefore we are able to share parallel programs in c , c++ , or fortran with collaborators elsewhere in the world who may even be running mpi on a different platform .",
    "we have run the linpack benchmark @xcite , a standard serial benchmark test on our computers to measure the speed of a single processor .",
    "the benchmark showed that a single 500 mhz pentium iii processor is capable of a peak speed between 84 mflops and 114 mflops ( million floating point operations per second ) for single precision arithmetic and between 62 mflop and 68 mflop for double precision arithmetic .",
    "the peak aggregate speed for the entire cluster of twenty processors , is therefore about 2 gflops .",
    ".comparison of performance of mpi qcd benchmark .",
    "comparison data from hioki and nakamura .",
    "@xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : qcdim ]      as we primarily developed the cluster for numerical simulations of lattice qcd , we have also performed a benchmark which specifically tests the performance in a parallel lattice qcd code .",
    "lattice qcd simulations are well suited for parallelization @xcite as they involve mostly local calculations on a multi - dimensional lattice",
    ". the algorithm can conveniently divide the lattice and assign the sections to different processors .",
    "the communication between the nodes therefore is not extremely large .",
    "hioki and nakamura @xcite provide comparison performance data on sx-4 ( nec ) , sr2201 ( hitachi ) , cenju-3 ( nec ) and paragon ( intel ) machines .",
    "specifically , we compare the computing time per link update in microseconds per link and the inter - node communication speed in mb / sec . the link update is a fundamental computational task within the qcd simulation and is therefore a useful standard .",
    "the test was a simulation of improved pure gauge lattice action ( @xmath0 plaquette and @xmath1 rectangle terms ) on a @xmath2 lattice . in each case",
    "the simulation was run on 16 processors .",
    "the results are summarised in table [ tab : qcdim ] .",
    "we believe that such a parallel cluster of pcs may be the cheapest solution to the problem of developing computing resources for scientific simulations . in 1999 , our cluster cost about us$14,000 , including all hardware and software .",
    "this equates to roughly $ 7/mflop .",
    "we can compare this to a commercial supercomputer .",
    "the cray t3e-1200e uses 1.2 gflop processors @xcite .",
    "the basic starting model comes with six processors for a total peak speed of 7.2 gflops .",
    "the cost for the six node model , though , is us$630,000 , or $ 87.50/mflop .",
    "our home made supercomputer is more than an order of magnitude cheaper .    of course this is a naive comparison , as the cray differs in many ways .",
    "notably , faster individual processors means serial jobs will run much faster , and parallel programs will require fewer processors , and hence less inter - processor communication . furthermore the inter - processor communication is much faster on the cray .",
    "it is clear , however that for numerical tasks that are easily broken in fairly independent tasks , a farm of pcs is an extremely economical solution by comparison .",
    "additionally , the pc cluster is highly scalable .",
    "pcs and their components are so ubiquitous , that expansion of the system is trivial . nearly anyone with a screwdriver , can upgrades or replaceme components so it is not nescessary to have a service contract with a commercial vendor .",
    "we feel that our parallel cluster of pc type computers is an example of an economical way to build a powerful computing resource for academic purposes . on an mpi qcd benchmark simulation",
    "it compares favorably with other mpi platforms .",
    "it is also drastically cheaper than commercial supercomputers for the same amount of processing speed .",
    "pc clusterssuch as this one have applications in both academia and in commercial enterprises .",
    "it is particularly suitable for developing research groups in countries where funding for pure research is more scarce .",
    "we believe that our cluster may be the first such facility at an academic physics department in mainland china .",
    "this work is supported by the national science fund for distinguished young scholars ( 19825117 ) , national science foundation , guangdong provincial natural science foundation ( 990212 ) and ministry of education of china .",
    "we are grateful for generous additional support from guoxun ( guangdong national communication network ) ltd .. we would also like to thank shinji hioki of tezukayama university for the use of the qcdimmpi code .",
