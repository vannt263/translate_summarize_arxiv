    "total integration times for each object were approximately 40 minutes , and consisted of four separate integrations with the qsos placed on each of the nicmos camera 3 detector quadrants in order to minimize pixel - to - pixel and large - scale sensitivity variations across the detector .",

    "there is thus no evidence of a change in this ratio with redshift .",
    "although the fe ii emission of agn has proven difficult to model ( see baldwin et al .",

    "if the iron detected in _ z _ @xmath4 6 qsos were produced mainly by sne ia , the evidence that it has reached solar and super - solar abundance levels has several important implications .",
    "first , the galaxy mass / metallicity relation indicates that the host galaxies of the qsos are very massive , possibly the progenitors of giant ellipticals ( see hamann & ferland 1999 and fan et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "such massive objects thus formed within @xmath10 1 gyr of the big bang .",
    "second , recent calculations of sne ia formation and ism enrichment timescales ( friaca & terlevich 1998 ) indicate that solar fe levels can be reached within 0.5 to 0.8 gyr after the formation of the progenitor stars . under currently favored cosmologies ( _ h _ @xmath4 0.7 , @xmath11 @xmath4 0.73 , @xmath12 @xmath4 0.27 )",
    "our results imply that the progenitor stars formed at _ z _ @xmath4 20 @xmath8 10 ( see freudling et al .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate of the first reionization epoch made from the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( bennett et al .",
    "finally , indirect and direct ( haiman & cen 2002 ) constraints on the ages of z @xmath4 6 qsos indicate that they reached their present luminosities near their observed redshifts .",
    "the evidence that the stars of their host galaxies formed at higher redshifts thus supports models of an evolutionary connection between nuclear star formation and the agn phenomenon ( e.g. norman & scoville 1988 ; kauffmann & haenelt 2000 ; kawakatu & umemura 2003 ) ."
