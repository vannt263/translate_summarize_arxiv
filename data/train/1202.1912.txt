    "green functions of yang - mills theories are gauge - dependent quantities .",
    "they can , however , be used as a starting point for the evaluation of hadronic observables ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the study of the infrared ( ir ) behavior of propagators and vertices is an important step in our understanding of qcd . in particular ,",
    "the confinement mechanism for color charges @xcite could reveal itself in the ir behavior of ( some of ) these green functions .",
    "this ir behavior should also be relevant for the description of the deconfinement transition and of the deconfined phase of qcd .",
    "indeed , at high temperature color charges are expected to be debye - screened and the ( electric and magnetic ) screening masses should be related to the ir behavior of the gluon propagator ( see for example @xcite ) .    among the gauge - fixing conditions employed in studies of yang - mills green functions ,",
    "a very popular choice is the landau gauge , which in momentum space reads @xmath20 . from the continuum perspective",
    "this gauge has various important properties , including its renormalizability , various associated nonrenormalization theorems @xcite and a ghost - antighost symmetry @xcite . in the past few years",
    "many analytic studies of green functions in landau gauge have focused on the solution of the yang - mills dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) , which are the exact quantum equations of motion of the theory ( see for example @xcite ) . since the dses are an infinite set of coupled equations , any attempt of solving them requires a truncation scheme .",
    "then , some green functions ( usually the gluon and the ghost propagators ) are obtained self - consistently from the considered equations , while all the other green functions entering the equations are given as an input . for the coupled dses of gluon and ghost propagators two solutions",
    "have been extensively analyzed ( see for example chapter 10 in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite for recent short reviews ) .",
    "the scaling solution @xcite finds in @xmath21 and 4 an ir - enhanced ghost propagator @xmath14 and a vanishing gluon propagator @xmath5 at zero momentum .",
    "in particular , the ir behavior of the two propagators should be given respectively by @xmath22 and by @xmath23 with @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the massive solution @xcite gives ( for @xmath12 and 4 ) a free - like ghost propagator in the ir limit , i.e.  @xmath25 , and a massive behavior for the gluon propagator , that is , @xmath13 and @xmath26 .",
    "the existence of two different types of solution for the coupled gluon and ghost dses is now understood as due to the use of different auxiliary _",
    "boundary conditions_. these conditions can be given in terms of the value of the ghost dressing function @xmath27 at a given momentum scale @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "in particular , if one considers @xmath29 , it is clear that @xmath30 gives an ir - enhanced ghost propagator @xmath14 while @xmath31 yields a free - like behavior for @xmath14 at small momenta . as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also the discussion in section 4.2.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the scaling condition @xmath30 relies on a particular cancellation in the ghost dse which , in turn , implies a specific `` critical '' value @xmath18 for the coupling constant @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "thus , at least from the mathematical point of view , there is a one - parameter family of solutions for the gluon and ghost dses , labelled by @xmath15 or , equivalently , by @xmath32 : in the case @xmath19 one recovers the scaling solution while , for all cases @xmath33 , the solution is a massive one .",
    "one gets a negative ghost propagator at small momenta . ] in @xmath34 , the su(3 ) physical value of the coupling seems to select the massive solution @xcite .    at this point",
    "we should recall that , when considering gauge - dependent quantities in non - abelian gauge theories , one has to deal with the existence of gribov copies @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . indeed , for compact non - abelian lie groups defined on the 4-sphere @xcite or on the 4-torus @xcite , it is impossible to find a continuous choice of one ( and only one ) connection @xmath35 on each gauge orbit .",
    "the effect of gribov copies is not seen in perturbation theory @xcite , i.e.  the usual faddeev - popov - quantization procedure is correct at the perturbative level .",
    "however , these copies could be relevant at the non - perturbative level , i.e.  in studies of the ir properties of yang - mills theories .",
    "different approaches have been proposed in order to quantize a yang - mills theory while taking into account the existence of gribov copies ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the one usually considered , both in the continuum and on the lattice , is based on restricting the functional integration to a subspace of the hyperplane of transverse configurations .",
    "the original proposal , made by gribov @xcite , was based on the observation that the landau gauge condition @xmath36 allows for ( infinitesimally ) gauge - equivalent configurations if the landau - gauge faddeev - popov operator @xmath37 has zero modes .",
    "( here @xmath38 is the usual covariant derivative . ) indeed , since an infinitesimal gauge transformation @xmath39 gives @xmath40 , it is clear that the exclusion ( in the path - integral measure ) of the zero modes of @xmath41 implies that gauge copies connected by such infinitesimal gauge transformations are ignored in the computation of expectation values . in order to exclude these zero modes ,",
    "gribov considered a stronger condition by requiring that the functional integration be restricted to the region @xmath42 of gauge configurations @xmath43 defined as @xmath44 this set , known as the ( first ) gribov region , clearly includes the vacuum configuration @xmath45 , for which the faddeev - popov operator is given by @xmath46 .",
    "the region @xmath42 can also be defined ( see for example @xcite ) as the whole set of local minima of the functional @xmath47 \\ , = \\ , \\int \\ , { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}^d x \\ , a_{\\mu}^b(x ) \\ , a_{\\mu}^b(x)$",
    "since usually each orbit allows for more than one local minimum of @xmath47 $ ] , it is clear that the region @xmath42 is not free of gribov copies . on the contrary , in the interior of the so - called fundamental modular region @xmath48 , given by the set of the absolute minima of the functional @xmath47 $ ] ,",
    "no gribov copies occur @xcite .",
    "the characterization of the fundamental modular region @xmath48 , i.e.  finding the absolute minima of the _ energy _ functional @xmath47 $ ] , is a problem similar to the determination of the ground state of a spin glass system @xcite .",
    "thus , a local formulation of a yang - mills theory , with the functional measure delimited to @xmath48 , is not available , whereas a practical way of restricting the physical configuration space to the region @xmath42 was introduced by gribov @xcite . to this end",
    ", he required that the ghost dressing function @xmath49 can not have a pole at finite nonzero momenta . after setting @xmath50",
    "this condition can be written as @xmath51 where @xmath0 is the so - called gribov ghost form - factor @xcite . indeed ,",
    "since the ghost propagator is given by @xmath52 i.e.  it is related to the inverse of the faddeev - popov matrix @xmath41 , the above inequality  known as the no - pole condition  should be equivalent to the restriction of the functional integration to the gribov region @xmath42 , i.e.  to the condition @xmath53 .    from the discussion above ,",
    "it is clear that both scaling and massive solutions of dses satisfy the no - pole condition , i.e.  @xmath54 for @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , in the scaling case @xcite , this condition [ together with the condition @xmath30 ] is imposed from the beginning to the solution of the dses .",
    "on the contrary , for the massive solution , the no - pole condition is either verified a posteriori , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , or used [ together with the condition @xmath31 ] as an input for the solution of the dses , as in refs .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the value of @xmath57 is fixed using lattice data .",
    "the restriction to the first gribov region @xmath42 is also always implemented in lattice numerical simulations of green functions in landau gauge by ( numerically ) finding local minima of the functional @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "results obtained using very large lattice volumes @xcite ( see also chapter 10 in ref .",
    "@xcite , section 3 in ref.@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite for recent short reviews ) have shown that in @xmath12 and 4 the gluon propagator @xmath5 is finite and nonzero in the limit @xmath7 while the ghost propagator @xmath14 behaves as @xmath58 .",
    "on the contrary , for @xmath4 the lattice data @xcite are in quantitative agreement with the scaling solution and one finds @xmath59 .",
    "since the region @xmath42 is not free of gribov copies , their ( possible ) influence on the numerical evaluation of gluon and ghost propagators has been studied by various groups @xcite .",
    "it has been found that these effects are usually observable only the ir limit and that any attempt to restrict the functional integration to the fundamental modular region @xmath48 gives a stronger suppression at small momenta for both propagators , i.e.  reducing the value of @xmath60 and increasing that of @xmath32 .",
    "more recently , it has been suggested @xcite that the one - parameter family of solutions obtained for the gluon and ghost dses should be related to gribov - copy effects and that the value of @xmath32 could be used as a gauge - fixing parameter .",
    "this analysis finds indeed ir - enhanced ghost propagators ( and sometimes a disconcerting over - scaling ) . on the other hand",
    ", the gluon propagator still shows a finite nonzero value at zero momentum , that is , @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , this approach does not explain why the numerical results found in @xmath4 are different from those obtained in @xmath12 and 4 , even though gribov copies inside the first gribov region @xmath42 are clearly present in any space - time dimension @xmath61 .    from the analytical point of view , following gribov s approach , zwanziger modified the usual yang - mills action in order to restrict the path integral to the first gribov region @xmath42 @xcite although this restriction is obtained using a non - local term , the gribov - zwanziger ( gz ) action can be written as a local action and it is proven @xcite to be renormalizable . at tree level",
    "the gz gluon propagator is given by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a parameter with mass - dimension 1 .",
    "at the same time , the ghost propagator is given by @xmath64 .",
    "thus , as in the scaling solution of the gluon and ghost dses , the gluon propagator is null at zero momentum within the gz approach by considering a non - analytic behavior for the free energy of the system @xcite . ] and the ghost propagator is ir - enhanced @xcite .",
    "these tree - level results , also in agreement with the original work by gribov @xcite , have been confirmed by one - loop calculations in the three- and four - dimensional cases @xcite .",
    "more recently , the gz action has been modified by considering ( for @xmath12 and 4 ) dimension - two condensates @xcite .",
    "the corresponding action , called the refined gribov - zwanziger ( rgz ) action , still imposes the restriction of the functional integration to the region @xmath42 and it is renormalizable .",
    "however , the rgz action allows for a finite nonzero value of @xmath60 and for a free - like ghost propagator @xmath65 in the ir limit .",
    "thus , nonzero values for these dimension - two condensates yield for the gluon and ghost propagators an ir behavior in agreement with the massive solution of the gluon and ghost dses .",
    "indeed , the rgz tree - level gluon propagator describes well the numerical data in the su(2 ) case @xcite , for @xmath12 and 4 , and in the su(3 ) case with @xmath66 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the fitting values for the dimension - two condensates are very similar for the su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge groups in the four - dimensional case .",
    "as stressed above , the restriction of the functional integration to the first gribov region @xmath42 and the no - pole condition ( [ eq : nopole ] ) are key ingredients in the study of the ir sector of yang - mills theories in landau gauge .",
    "however , to our knowledge , a detailed investigation of the properties of the gribov form - factor @xmath0 as well as of the possible implications of the no - pole condition was missing up to now , although some interesting one - loop results were already presented in refs.@xcite . in particular , in appendix b.2 of @xcite it was shown that , if the gluon propagator @xmath5 is positive , then in the @xmath6 case the derivative @xmath67 is negative for all values of @xmath68 , i.e.  @xmath0 is largest at @xmath69 . also , in ref .  @xcite it was proven that in the rgz framework the form - factor @xmath0 presents a logarithmic ir singularity @xmath70 for @xmath4 .",
    "this result precluded the use of the rgz action in the two - dimensional case , leading to a first interpretation of the different behavior found in lattice numerical simulations for the @xmath6 case , compared to the @xmath12 and 4 cases .",
    "similar findings have been ( more recently ) presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we collect some general properties of the gribov form - factor @xmath0 and we study the consequences of imposing the no - pole condition .",
    "in particular , in section [ sec : ghost - prop ] , using the expression for @xmath0 obtained from the evaluation of the ghost propagator at one loop , we prove that @xmath0 attains its maximum value at @xmath69 for any dimension @xmath71 . since this expression for @xmath0 depends on the gluon propagator @xmath5 , in the same section we also investigate ( for a general @xmath2-dimensional space - time ) which ir behavior of the gluon propagator is necessary in order to satisfy the no - pole condition @xmath9 . by considering a generic ( and sufficiently regular ) gluon propagator @xmath5 , we find in the @xmath4 case that @xmath0 is unbounded unless the gluon propagator is null at zero momentum .",
    "more exactly , we find @xmath72 in the @xmath7 limit , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "this result does not apply to the @xmath12 and 4 cases .",
    "indeed , in these cases one can introduce , for all values of @xmath68 , simple finite upper bounds for the gribov form - factor . in section [ sec : sigma234 ]",
    "we present explicit one - loop calculations for @xmath0 using for the gluon propagator @xmath5 linear combinations of yukawa - like propagators ( with real and/or complex - conjugate poles ) , which have been recently used to model lattice data of the gluon propagator in the su(2 ) case @xcite .",
    "besides confirming the results obtained in section [ sec : ghost - prop ] , we also find that the ghost propagator admits a one - parameter family of behaviors @xcite labelled by the coupling constant @xmath15 , considered as a free parameter .",
    "moreover , the massive solution @xmath73 , corresponding to @xmath74 , is obtained for all values of @xmath15 smaller than a `` critical '' value @xmath18 . at the `` critical '' value @xmath18 , implying @xmath75 , one finds an ir - enhanced ghost propagator .",
    "( as already stressed above , the case @xmath76 corresponds to @xmath77 and one obtains a negative ghost propagator at small momenta . ) finally , in section [ sec : dse ] , we analyze the dse for @xmath0 .",
    "we stress that in this case we do not try to solve the dse but we focus only on general properties of this equation .",
    "as we will see , considering ir - finite ghost - gluon vertices , we confirm and extend the one - loop analysis of the no - pole condition presented in section [ sec : ghost - prop ] . in particular , after introducing bounds for the gribov form - factor , we show again for @xmath4 that the gluon propagator @xmath5 must vanish at zero momentum in order to keep @xmath0 finite . on the contrary ,",
    "such a constraint does not apply in the three- and four - dimensional cases .",
    "we also present alternative evidence for the @xmath4 result using a spectral representation for the ghost propagator in the dse .",
    "it is important to note that all our results in sections [ sec : ghost - prop ] and [ sec : dse ] apply irrespective of which set of gribov copies ( inside the region @xmath42 ) is considered , i.e.they are not affected by the so - called gribov noise .",
    "we end with our conclusion in section [ sec : concl ] .",
