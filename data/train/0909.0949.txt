    "it is a great pleasure and honor to be part of misha shifman s 60th birthday celebration . among misha s many outstanding contributions to particle physics",
    "is his well - known proposal , in collaboration with arkady vainshtein and valentine zakharov , that the axion may be very light and very weakly coupled @xcite .",
    "here is the abstract of their paper : 0.1 in _ p- and t - invariance violation in quantum chromodynamics due to the so - called @xmath1-term is discussed .",
    "it is shown that irrespectively of how the confinement works there emerge observable p- and t - odd effects .",
    "the proof is based on the assumption that qcd resolves the u(1 ) problem , i.e. , the mass of the singlet pseudoscalar meson does not vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "we suggest a modification of the axion scheme which restores the natural p and t invariance of the theory and can not be ruled out experimentally . _    the @xmath1-term mentioned by shifman et al . is @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the qcd field strengths , @xmath4 is the qcd coupling constant and @xmath1 is a parameter .",
    "a @xmath1-term is generally present in the action density of the standard model of elementary particles @xcite .",
    "its existence raises a puzzle , called the strong cp problem . as shifman",
    "explain in their paper , the physics of qcd necessarily depends on the value of @xmath1 , if none of the quark masses vanish , because otherwise qcd would nt solve the u@xmath5(1 ) problem ( of explaining why the mass of the singlet pseudoscalar meson does not vanish in the chiral limit ) and hence could nt be the correct theory of strong interactions .",
    "this is an important point .",
    "if it were possible for qcd to be independent of @xmath1 , the strong cp problem would nt be so urgent .",
    "one can show that qcd physics depends on the value of @xmath1 only through the combination @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the quark mass matrix . if @xmath8 the strong interactions violate p and cp .",
    "such p and cp violation is incompatible with the experimental upper bound on the neutron electic dipole moment @xcite unless @xmath9 . in the standard model , p and cp violation",
    "are introduced by letting the elements of the quark mass matrix @xmath7 be arbitrary complex numbers @xcite . in that case , @xmath10 is of order one .",
    "the strong cp problem is the problem of explaining why @xmath9 instead .",
    "the strong cp problem is solved if the term ( [ ggdual ] ) in the standard model action density is replaced by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a new scalar field , and @xmath13 is a constant with dimension of energy . in the modified theory ,",
    "@xmath14   depends on the expectation value of @xmath12 .",
    "this field settles to a value that minimizes the effective potential .",
    "the strong cp problem is solved because the minimum of the qcd effective potential @xmath15 occurs at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 interaction in eq .",
    "( [ ax ] ) is not renormalizable .",
    "however , there is a recipe for constructing renormalizable theories whose low energy effective action density is of the form of eq .",
    "( [ ax ] ) : construct the theory in such a way that it has a u@xmath18 symmetry which is a global symmetry of the classical action density , is broken by the color anomaly , and is spontaneously broken .",
    "such a symmetry is called peccei - quinn symmetry after its inventors @xcite . weinberg and",
    "wilczek @xcite pointed out that a theory with u@xmath18 symmetry has a light pseudo - scalar particle , called the axion .",
    "the axion field is @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is of order the expectation value that breaks u@xmath18 , and is called the  axion decay constant \" .",
    "the axion mass is given in terms of @xmath13 by @xcite @xmath19 all axion couplings are inversely proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "the axion coupling to two photons is : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath23 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath24 is a model - dependent coefficient of order one . it had first been thought that @xmath13 is of order the electroweak scale , in which case the axion couplings have strength typical of neutrinos and the axion mass is relatively large , in the 10 kev to 10 mev range .",
    "such axions were quickly ruled out by particle physics ( beam dumps and rare decays ) and nuclear physics experiments .",
    "but shifman and others showed @xcite that @xmath13 can be made arbitrarily large , and hence the axion can be made arbitrarily light and weakly coupled .",
    "such an axion is unconstrained by the aforementioned experiments , and was dubbed ` invisible ' .",
    "may an invisible axion really exist ?    the axion has been searched for in many places , and has not been found @xcite .",
    "axion masses larger than about 50 kev are ruled out by the aforementioned particle and nuclear physics experiments .",
    "the next range of axion masses , in decreasing order , is ruled out by stellar evolution arguments .",
    "the longevity of red giants rules out 200 kev @xmath25 0.5 ev @xcite in case the axion has negligible coupling to the electron ( such an axion is called ` hadronic ' ) , and 200 kev @xmath26 ev @xcite in case the axion has a sizable coupling to electrons .",
    "the duration of the neutrino pulse from supernova 1987a rules out 2 ev @xmath27 ev @xcite . finally , there is a lower limit , @xmath28 ev , from cosmology which is discussed in the next section .",
    "this leaves open an  axion window \" : @xmath29 ev .",
    "the lower edge of this window ( @xmath30 ev ) is much softer than its upper edge .",
    "there are two populations of axions produced in the early universe , which we may call hot ( or thermal ) and cold .",
    "hot axions are produced in thermal processes such as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a quark and @xmath4 a gluon , or @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a pion @xcite .",
    "the number density of thermal axions today ( time @xmath35 ) is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the effective number of thermal degrees of freedom at the time axions decouple from the thermal bath .",
    "the standard model has @xmath38 .",
    "thermal axions are a form of hot dark matter , similar to neutrinos , in the context of large scale structure formation .",
    "the cold axions are produced when the potential @xmath15 , and hence the axion mass , turns on near the qcd phase transition @xcite .",
    "the critical time , defined by @xmath39 , is @xmath40 sec @xmath41 .",
    "cold axions are the quanta of oscillation of the axion field that result from the turn on of the axion mass .",
    "the average number density of cold axions at time @xmath42 is @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ nat1 ] ) , we used the fact that the axion field @xmath12 is approximately homogeneous on the horizon scale @xmath42 , because wiggles in @xmath12 which entered the horizon long before @xmath42 have been red - shifted away @xcite .",
    "we also used the fact that the initial departure of @xmath12 from the cp conserving minimum is of order @xmath13 .",
    "the axions of eq .",
    "( [ nat1 ] ) are non - relativistic .",
    "assuming that the ratio of the axion number density to the entropy density is constant from time @xmath42 till today , one finds @xcite @xmath44 for the ratio of the axion energy density to the critical density for closing the universe .",
    "@xmath45 is the present hubble rate in units of 100 km / s.mpc .",
    "the requirement that axions do not overclose the universe implies the constraint @xmath46  ev . for a more detailed discussion of the production and properties of dark matter axions ,",
    "the reader may wish to consult refs .",
    "it has been established from a variety of observational inputs that approximately 23% of the energy density of the universe is  cold dark matter \" ( cdm ) .",
    "the cdm particles must be non - baryonic , and cold .",
    " cold \" means that their primordial velocity dispersion is small enough that it can be set equal to zero for all practical purposes when discussing the formation of large scale structure .",
    "the leading candidates for the cdm particles are axions , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , e.g. the neutralino in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , and sterile neutrinos with mass in the kev range .",
    "a central problem in dark matter studies is the question how cdm is distributed in the halos of galaxies , and in particular in the halo of our milky way galaxy .",
    "indeed , knowledge of this distribution is essential for understanding galactic dynamics and for predicting signals in direct and indirect searches for dark matter on earth .",
    "galactic halos are thought to be collisionless fluids and must therefore be described in 6-dimensional phase space .",
    "a full description gives the phase space distribution @xmath47 of the dark matter particles in the halo , i.e. their velocity ( @xmath48 ) distribution at every position @xmath49 .",
    "an important simplification occurs in the case of _ cold _ dark matter because cdm particles lie in phase space on a thin 3-dimensional hypersurface .",
    "this fact implies that the velocity distribution is everywhere discrete @xcite and that there are surfaces in physical space , called caustics , where the density of dark matter is very large .",
    "galactic halos have two types of caustics , outer and inner .",
    "the outer caustics are simple fold ( @xmath50 ) catastrophes located on nested topological spheres surrounding the galaxy .",
    "the catastrophe structure of the inner caustics depends on the angular momentum distribution of the infalling dark matter particles .",
    "if that angular momentum distribution is dominated by net overall rotation , implying @xmath51 , the inner caustics are a set of ` tricusp rings ' .",
    "a tricusp ring is a closed tube whose cross section is a section of the _ elliptic umbilic _ ( @xmath52 ) catastrophe @xcite .",
    "the rings are located in the plane of the galaxy . in the self - similar infall model @xcite ,",
    "generalized to include the effect of angular momentum @xcite , the caustic ring radii @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) are predicted to obey the law @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the rotation velocity of the galaxy and @xmath57 is a parameter characterizing the amount of angular momentum that the dark matter particles carry .",
    "observational evidence for caustic rings at the radii @xmath53 predicted by eq .",
    "( [ crr ] ) was found in the rotation curves of external galaxies @xcite , the rotation curve of our own galaxy @xcite , and an iras map of the galactic plane in the direction of the nearest caustic ring ( @xmath58)@xcite . a summary of the evidence can be found in ref .",
    "the evidence implies that the distribution of @xmath57 values over nearby spiral galaxies , including the milky way , is peaked at @xmath59 .",
    "it also implies that we on earth are close to a cusp in the nearest caustic ring of dark matter . as a result ,",
    "the dark matter velocity distribution on earth is dominated by a single flow , of known velocity vector .",
    "that single flow , called the  big flow \" has density of order 1 gev / cc , which is two or three times larger than the commonly cited estimates of the _ total _ local dark matter density .",
    "finally , the evidence for caustic rings of dark matter halos implies that the dark matter particles fall in with net overall rotation , and hence that their velocity field has non - zero curl : @xmath51 .",
    "if their velocity field were irrotational ( @xmath60 ) , the inner caustics would have a tent - like structure @xcite which is quite distinct from that of the caustic rings for which evidence was found .",
    "this raises a puzzle .",
    "indeed if the dark matter is cold and collisionless , as is the case for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) and was thought to be the case for axions , the velocity field remains irrotational at all times because it is the outcome of gravitational forces proportional to the gradient of the newtonian potential @xcite .",
    "( general relativistic effects allow the creation of rotational velocity fields but are subdominant because the velocities involved are much less than the speed of light . ) thus , if the dark matter is cold and collisionless , one expects the inner caustics of galactic halos to be the tent - like structures of the @xmath60 case , instead of the rings for which evidence was found .",
    "this puzzle has bothered me for a number of years , but qiaoli yang and i may now have found a solution to it @xcite . as explained below ,",
    "cold dark matter axions form a bose - einstein condensate . as a result ,",
    "their properties differ from those of ordinary cdm .",
    "the number density of cold axions implied by eq .",
    "( [ nat1 ] ) is @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the cosmological scale factor .",
    "because the axion momenta are of order @xmath63 at time @xmath42 and vary with time as @xmath64 , the velocity dispersion of cold axions is @xmath65 _ if _ each axion remains in whatever state it is in , i.e. if axion interactions are negligible .",
    "let us refer to this case as the limit of decoupled cold axions .",
    "if decoupled , the average state occupation number of cold axions is @xmath66 clearly , the effective temperature of cold axions is much smaller than the critical temperature @xmath67 for bec .",
    "axion number violating processes , such as their decay to two photons , occur only on time scales vastly longer than the age of the universe .",
    "the only condition for axion bec that is not clearly satisfied is thermal equilibrium .",
    "axions are in thermal equilibrium if their relaxation rate @xmath68 is large compared to the hubble expansion rate @xmath69 . at low phase space densities , the relaxation rate is of order the particle interaction rate @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the scattering cross - section .",
    "axions have self interactions described by the action density @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "the cross - section for @xmath74 scattering due to axion self interaction is _ in vacuum _",
    "@xmath75 if one substitutes @xmath76 for @xmath71 , @xmath77 is found much smaller than the hubble rate , by many orders of magnitude .",
    "however , in the cold axion fluid background , the scattering rate is enhanced by the average quantum state occupation number of both final state axions , @xmath78 , because energy conservation forces the final state axions to be in highly occupied states if the initial axions are in highly occupied states . in that case",
    ", the relaxation rate is multiplied by _",
    "one _ factor of @xmath79 @xcite @xmath80 combining eqs .",
    "( [ numden]-[occnum],[xs0 ] ) , one finds @xmath81 , suggesting that cold axions thermalize at time @xmath42 through their self interactions , but only barely so .",
    "it may seem surprising that the huge and tiny factors on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) cancel each other .",
    "in fact the cancellation is not an accident .",
    "consider a generic axion - like particle ( alp ) whose mass @xmath82 and decay constant @xmath13 are unrelated to each other .",
    "its self interaction coupling strength @xmath83 .",
    "cold alps appear at a time @xmath84 with number density @xmath85 , and velocity dispersion @xmath86 . substituting these estimates in eqs .",
    "( [ occnum ] ) , ( [ xs0 ] ) and ( [ rate ] ) ,",
    "one finds that the thermalization rate is of order the hubble rate at @xmath42 , for all @xmath13 and @xmath82 .    a critical aspect of axion bec phenomenology is whether the bec continues to thermalize after it has formed .",
    "axion bec means that ( almost ) all axions go to one state .",
    "however , only if the bec continually rethermalizes does the axion state track the lowest energy state .    the particle kinetic equations that yield eq .  ( [ rate ] ) are valid only when the energy dispersion @xmath87 is larger than the thermalization rate @xcite .",
    "after @xmath42 this condition is no longer satisfied .",
    "one enters then a regime where the relaxation rate due to self interactions is of order @xmath88 @xmath89 is of order one at time @xmath42 but decreases as @xmath90 afterwards .",
    "hence , self interactions are insufficient to cause axion bec to rethermalize after @xmath42 even if they cause axion bec at @xmath42",
    ". however gravitational interactions , which are long range , come in to play .",
    "the relaxation rate due to gravitational interactions is of order @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the correlation length .",
    "@xmath93 is of order @xmath94 at time @xmath42 but grows as @xmath95 .",
    "thus gravitational interactions cause the axions to thermalize and form a bec when the photon temperature is of order 100 ev  @xmath96 .",
    "the process of axion bose - einstein condensation is constrained by causality .",
    "thus one expects overlapping condensate patches with typical size of order the horizon . as time goes on ,",
    "say from @xmath97 to @xmath98 , the axions in @xmath97-size condensate patches rethermalize into @xmath98-size patches .",
    "the correlation length is then of order the horizon at all times , implying @xmath99 instead of eq .",
    "( [ veldis ] ) , and @xmath100 after the bec has formed .",
    "therefore gravitational interactions rethermalize the axion bec on ever shorter time scales compared to the age of the universe .",
    "to compare axion bec with cdm , let us divide the observations into three arenas : 1 ) the behaviour of density perturbations on the scale of the horizon , 2 ) their behaviour during the linear regime of evolution within the horizon , and 3 ) their behaviour during the non - linear regime .",
    "cdm provides a very successful description in arena 2",
    ". however , axion bec and cdm are indistinguishable in arena 2 on all scales of observational interest @xcite . in particular , the equation governing the evolution of axion bec perturbations is @xmath119 where @xmath120 is co - moving wavevector . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ deneq ] ) is absent for cdm .",
    "( [ deneq ] ) implies that the axion bec has jeans length @xmath121 however , the jeans length is small compared to the smallest scales ( @xmath122 100 kpc ) for which we have observations on the behavior of density perturbations in the linear regime .    in the non - linear regime of structure formation ( arena 3 ) and in the absence of rethermalization , axion bec and cdm again",
    "differ only on length scales smaller than de broglie wavelength .",
    "this follows from the wkb approximation and has also been shown by numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "since the axion de broglie wavelength ( of order 10 meters in galactic halos ) is negligbly small compared to all length scales of observational interest , we again find that axion bec and cdm are indistinguishable when there is no rethermalization of the bec .",
    "however , it was found above that gravitational interactions do rethermalize the axion bec continually so that the axion state tracks the lowest energy state .",
    "this is relevant to the angular momentum distribution of dark matter axions in galactic halos .",
    "the angular momentum of galaxies is caused by the gravitational torque of nearby galaxies early on when protogalaxies are still close to one another @xcite . as was mentioned in section iii",
    ", cdm presents us with a puzzle .",
    "the velocity field of ordinary cold dark matter , such as wimps , remains irrotational whereas the evidence for caustic rings of dark matter implies that the dark matter falls in with net overall rotation .",
    "the puzzle is solved if the dark matter is an axion bec which rethermalizes while tidal torque is applied to it .",
    "indeed , the lowest energy state for given total angular momentum is one in which each particle carries an equal amount of angular momentum . in that case",
    "there is net overall rotation .",
    "@xmath51 is accomodated in the bec through the appearance of vortices .",
    "the phenomenon is observed in quantum liquids and well understood @xcite .",
    "finally let s consider the behaviour of density perturbations as they enter the horizon ( arena 1 ) . here",
    "too axion bec differs from cdm .",
    "the cdm perturbations evolve linearly at all times .",
    "the axion bec perturbations do not evolve linearly when they enter the horizon because the condensates which prevailed in neighboring horizon volumes rearrange themselves , through their gravitational interactions , into a new condensate for the expanded horizon volume .",
    "this produces local correlations between modes of different wavevector since the perturbation of wavevector @xmath123 , upon entering the horizon , is determined by the perturbations of wavevector say @xmath124 in its neighborhood . we propose this as a mechanism for the alignment of cmbr anisotropy multipoles @xcite through the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
    "unlike cdm , the isw effect is large in axion bec because the newtonian potential @xmath125 changes entirely after entering the horizon in response to the rearrangement of the axion bec .",
