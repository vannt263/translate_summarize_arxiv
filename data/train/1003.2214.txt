    "neutral hydrogen emits and absorbs radiation at 21  cm in its rest frame throughout the history of the universe .",
    "the brightness of the 21  cm line observed today from various redshifts is determined by the spatial distribution and peculiar velocity of the neutral hydrogen that emitted it .",
    "the radiation from any particular redshift has small angular variations , similar to those in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "there is also variation along the line of sight , with a correlation depth of approximately @xmath0  mpc  @xcite . in the absence of physics that violates free streaming",
    ", one does not expect a correlation among slices in the line - of - sight direction that are separated by more than this correlation length .",
    "since observations can measure the redshift of 21  cm emission precisely , we should be able to extract information about this line of sight variation from 21  cm observations .",
    "it is this third dimension of information encoded in 21  cm radiation that can make it a powerful new tool to learn about fundamental physics .",
    "one path forward is to look for physics that violates free streaming and generates correlations among distinct redshift shells  @xcite .",
    "several sources of such a signal have been identified , though they are limited to the epoch during and after reionization  @xcite .",
    "though passive perturbations , such as those seeded by inflation , can not generate such correlations , active sources of perturbation could .",
    "active sources of perturbation include cosmic strings and other topological defects , such as textures @xcite , as well as the field gradients that are left behind after global phase transitions @xcite . of these ,",
    "cosmic strings are the most thoroughly studied and have perhaps the richest phenomenology @xcite , so they will be our focus .",
    "moving strings generate density wakes in the material through which they pass @xcite , including neutral hydrogen . as a result",
    ", the brightness of the 21  cm emission , which depends on the density and the velocity of the emitters , will be directly perturbed in the string s wake  @xcite . the same moving strings also perturb the background cmb light , monotonically shifting the spectra and creating line discontinuities in the temperature screen of the sky  a phenomenon known as the gott - kaiser - stebbins ( gks ) @xcite effect .",
    "gks is a special case of the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite caused by time - varying gravitational potentials sourced by moving strings .",
    "thus , there will be some correlation between string - sourced 21  cm brightness fluctuations at any redshift and a part of the cmb temperature anisotropy .",
    "strings will also induce some cross - correlation in 21  cm fluctuations coming from different redshifts .",
    "however , as we discuss in section  [ sec : physics ] , we expect this effect to be relatively small .    precision measurements of the cmb temperature anisotropy limit the contribution of cosmic string perturbations to be less than about 10% of the total over the range of scales covered by wmap  @xcite . as such",
    ", the bulk of the universe s anisotropy comes from the primordial inflationary fluctuations , for which the cross - correlation between sufficiently - separated shells is zero .",
    "the fact that any string contribution to primordial anisotropy must be small means that the intrinsic signal for which we are searching will be faint .",
    "however , since there is nothing in the standard @xmath1cdm model that could generate such cross correlations before the epoch of reionization , we can be sure that discovery of such a cross correlation would be a sign of new physics .    to examine the prospects for detecting these string - induced correlations",
    ", we will evaluate the signal - to - noise density of this effect and the volume over which the signal can be found .",
    "our aim is to identify the optimal way of looking for stringy phenomena in the 21  cm radiation from the dark ages .",
    "this effect is present over a vast volume  from @xmath2 until the onset of reionization  which may make a detection of the cmb/21 cm correlation feasible under optimistic observing scenarios .",
    "however , because of uncertainties in reionization physics , we exclude a large region ( @xmath3 ) from our present study .",
    "we will also leave the calculation of 21 cm @xmath4 21 cm cross - correlation from different redshifts for future work .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the string network model of @xcite , which was previously implemented in cmbfast @xcite and made available publicly as cmbact  @xcite . for this work",
    ", we have implemented this string model in camb  @xcite .",
    "our code will be made publicly available soon @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings are relativistically moving linear topological defects that are remnants of the high energy early universe . as they move , strings affect matter by kicking it into over - dense wakes and perturb light by shifting its spectrum via the gks effect .",
    "strings form in the early universe and remain active through all epochs , spreading their effects throughout the universe s history .",
    "the effect of cosmic string networks on the cmb power spectrum has been well studied .",
    "strings affect the cmb in both of the ways described above : their wakes generate a single peak at an angular scale determined by the strings correlation length ( @xmath5 ) , and strings in the foreground of the cmb generate an interlacing network of linear discontinuities through the gks effect .",
    "the fact that these signatures have not been observed provide a bound on the density and tension of cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "these effects are also present during the dark ages , when the neutral hydrogen is releasing 21  cm radiation . moving strings produce wakes and thus seed hydrogen density contrasts that grow and generate observable variations in the brightness temperature .",
    "interestingly , though , the gks effect is much less observable for 21  cm radiation .",
    "strings shift the spectrum of light that passes them , so their effect on passing light is only observable when there is a noticeable change in the known background source , such as a shift in a spectral peak or discontinuity in a smoothly varying brightness . however , in the presence of a flat spectrum of background light , the string is invisible , since a lateral shift of a horizontal spectrum results in no detectable change . in the dark ages , strings will be swimming in a background of continuously renewed radio waves , with a very weak gradient in brightness and spectrum .",
    "thus , the strings gks effect on 21  cm radiation will be considerably less observable than the same effect applied to cmb photons .    to calculate these string - sourced effects quantitatively",
    ", we must give a formal characterization of the string perturbations .",
    "the most important difference between string - sourced perturbations and those from inflation , besides the active / passive distinction , is that strings source vector mode perturbations . for strings ,",
    "vector modes are as large as scalar modes , and they also generate much of the novel phenomenology of string networks @xcite .",
    "vector modes are usually neglected since they decay in systems described by general relativity and ordinary matter .",
    "strings , however , actively source vector perturbations faster than they can decay away .",
    "we will reproduce the most relevant equations for vector mode perturbations in the appendix .    calculating cmb and 21  cm observables",
    "also requires a string model and a code for tracing the history of light streaming to us now from these early times .",
    "to this end , we have incorporated a model for strings @xcite ( see   [ model ] for a description ) into the 21  cm extension of camb  @xcite ; this code will be publicly released @xcite .",
    "our major addition to the underlying camb code is the inclusion of vector mode fluctuations .",
    "details about how string - sourced vector modes enter the boltzmann equation can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , and will be more comprehensively explained in @xcite .",
    "now we can ask what physics will control the shape and amplitude of string - sourced two - point functions in the 21  cm fluctuations and in the cross correlation .",
    "the two physical effects controlling the shape of these spectra are 1 ) the intrinsic brightness of the 21  cm photons and 2 ) the correlation length of the string network .",
    "the brightness temperature sets the amplitude of the spectrum .",
    "it , in turn , is determined by the difference between the 21  cm spin temperature and the cmb temperature at that epoch , which are mismatched over a long period during the dark ages @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the brightness temperature is negative throughout most of the dark ages .",
    "that is , the neutral hydrogen is absorbing , not emitting , radiation .",
    "this shows up as an observable because we can infer what the flux of long wavelength cmb photons should be , and hence detect the dimming due to neutral hydrogen .",
    "since we are looking for small variations in the brightness temperature , a large intrinsic brightness makes detections easier .",
    "the anisotropy of 21  cm brightness is chiefly caused by variations in the density and the peculiar velocity of the neutral hydrogen , both of which are sourced by cosmic strings .",
    "these effects and others are more comprehensively discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the correlation length of the string network sets the location of the peak in @xmath6-space , the angular scale . since this correlation length is some fraction of the hubble scale , the spectrum from dark ages strings peaks for multipoles @xmath7 .",
    "this peak in the two - point function corresponds to the size of the wakes generated by the string network at that epoch .",
    "hence , the peak signal migrates to lower-@xmath6 as the redshift decreases since the network is scaling with the horizon , and the horizon is growing .",
    "this trend can be seen in our fig .",

    "the general shape  anti - correlation with a single broad peak  is similar for all redshifts , though the @xmath6 of maximum correlation moves to larger scales at later times / lower redshifts .",
    "this pattern comes from the string network s scaling behaviour : strings seed fluctuations at a fixed fraction of the horizon size at the epoch in which the seed is created .",
    "this corresponds to larger scales ( smaller @xmath6 s ) for later times , i.e. , for lower redshifts .",
    "a contour at @xmath11 ^ 2 $ ] is shown . ]",
    "the string code we used is based on the segment model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the string network is represented by a collection of uncorrelated straight string segments moving with uncorrelated , random velocities .",
    "there are two fundamental length scales in such a model : @xmath12 , the length of a string segment , which represents the typical length of roughly straight segments in a full network ; and @xmath13 , the typical length between two string segments , which sets the number density of strings in a given volume ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the model also tracks the root - mean - square ( rms ) velocity of the string segments .",
    "these parameters are deduced by assuming network scaling ",
    ", the string energy density tracks the dominant background energy density in the radiation and matter eras .",
    "numerical simulations of networks have confirmed that these assumptions accurately describe network physics .",
    "the positions and orientations of the segments are drawn from uniform distributions in space and on a two - sphere , respectively .",
    "the model s parameters have been calibrated to produce source correlation functions in agreement with those in ref .",
    "@xcite . because of the approximations built into the string segments , the model can only produce two - point correlation functions .",
    "it can not be used for making simulated string maps or other more sophisticated observables ; though it could , with some modification , generate three - point functions @xcite .    on the cosmological scales we consider , finer details of the string evolution do not play a major role .",
    "it is the large - scale properties  such as the scaling distance , the equation of state ( wiggliness ) , and the rms velocity  that determine the shape of the string - induced spectra .",
    "further details of the computational methods necessary to compute the 21  cm signal will be included in a subsequent publication @xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the anisotropy in the 21  cm brightness temperature emitted at redshift @xmath16 and observed at a spatial position @xmath17 coming from the propagation direction @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , the cmb brightness temperature is characterized by @xmath19 . for computational purposes",
    "these quantities are expanded into normal modes  @xcite t^x(,)=__m=-2 ^ 2t_m^x ( )  g_^m , where @xmath20 is the fourier conjugate to @xmath17 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the associated multipole moments in the basis g_^m=(-i)^y_^m()i.[eq : harmonics ] in our analysis we use the angular correlation function between quantities @xmath23 and @xmath24 as measured by an observer at @xmath25 , defined as c^xy ( ) & & t^z ( ) t^cmb(^)_^= + & = & _ = 0^(2 + 1)c_^xyp _ ( ) where @xmath26 are the legendre polynomials , and @xmath27 is the anisotropy spectrum calculated from the associated multipoles @xmath28",

    "the total signal - to - noise @xmath32 is then sn^2_tot=__z_i ( ^2 ( z_i,,z_i ) )  , where the sum is over the harmonic multipoles @xmath6 and the ( independent ) observed redshift slices @xmath35 of width @xmath36 , determined by the observational setup .",
    "each multipole can receive contributions from the inflationary background @xmath37 , the active sources @xmath38 , and astrophysical and telescope noise @xmath39 , so we can write c_^xy[]=c_^adxy+c_^strxy+c_^nxy .",
    "[ eq : cl ]    strings are the only source of the cross - correlation , so the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s2n ] ) receives only one contribution .",
    "the denominator , however , receives a large contribution from inflationary perturbations that are at least ten times the size of the string power spectrum .",
    "there is also a large contribution from the detector noise which is dominated by the galactic emission at the low frequencies we need to probe the high redshift 21  cm brightness temperature .",
    "the detector noise is uncorrelated between the cmb and 21  cm frequencies and is given by c_^n=(2)^3 t_sys^2 ( ) t_obs f^2 _ cover ^2_max ( )  , [ eq : cltsys ] where @xmath40 is dominated by the sky temperature and , for regions away from the galactic plane , can be approximated as @xcite t_sys()=150 k ( 180 mhz ) ^-2.6 . in the previous expressions @xmath41",

    "foregrounds include galactic and extragalactic point sources , as well as the galactic and extragalactic free - free emission , all of which are expected to induce correlations between different frequencies  @xcite . in this study , however , astrophysical sources will have a negligible effect since we are only including 21  cm cross - correlations with cmb photons , and these signals quickly decorrelate with increasing frequency separation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these signals dominate on very small scales while string - induced correlations reside on large scales , @xmath47 .",
    "we fold the observational parameters into a single observational ambition parameter , @xmath48 , defined as xt_obs f_cover^2 d^2 , with units of @xmath49=[years]\\times[{\\rm km}]^2 $ ] .",
    "there is always a practical trade - off between making @xmath50 large and making @xmath51 large . for our signal ,",
    "though , it is clear what we should choose .",
    "the main reason for going to large @xmath51 is to resolve very small angular scales .",
    "however , string sourced cross correlations reside only on large angular scales .",
    "hence , we can make due with a relatively small baseline @xmath51 , which should let us make @xmath50 nearly unity ; i.e. , a `` moderately '' sized telescope or array with nearly a complete covering area would be ideal for searching for strings .",
    "we have calculated cross correlation power spectra from redshifts throughout the dark ages . in producing our results ,",
    "we have fixed the observing bandwidth to @xmath52 ; however , varying this does not change our result .",
    "although increasing the bandwidth diminishes the autocorrelator signal ( noise `` @xmath53''@xmath54 ) and , thus , increases the signal - to - noise in each redshift bin , one observes fewer independent redshift slices as a result ( signal `` @xmath55''@xmath54 ) so the overall signal - to - noise remains unchanged to first order .",
    "we have numerically verified this for bandwidths in the range @xmath56 .",
    "we have excluded the epoch of reionization ( @xmath3 ) from our signal - to - noise results .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "the main reason is that reionization physics are still too uncertain for reliable calculations to be done , and the details of reionization , once begun , will dominate the 21  cm physics . moreover , if cosmic strings are present during reionization , they will likely play a role in speeding up the process of reionization through their early generation of non - linear overdensities @xcite .",
    "reionization itself will also create cross - correlations between the cmb and 21  cm radiation  @xcite . though it is possible that the string and reionization signals could be disentangled if they are both present , we restrict ourselves in the present study to redshifts where strings are the only possible source of cross - correlation .    at redshifts",
    "@xmath57 reionization is complete and the surviving neutral hydrogen only exist in islands that are presumably correlated with large scale structure . in principle , we can continue calculating the string sourced cross correlation between the matter distribution ( traced via 21  cm or any other observable light ) and the cmb .",
    "however , there will be competing sources of cross correlation .",
    "for instance , the re - scattering of cmb photons off ionized particles will induce a correlation of cmb with the large - scale plasma distribution @xcite .",
    "eventually , at lower redshifts , there will be a correlation between large scale structure and the isw distortion of the cmb caused time varying potentials when dark energy becomes dynamically important .",
    "nonetheless , we have made an approximate calculation of what a hypothetical radio survey at these redshifts might see in the presence of strings , extending an analytical distribution of large scale structure tracers used in @xcite to the range @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting theoretical signal - to - noise for the cross correlation was too small .",
    "this is not surprising since string wakes that are sourced at such late times have not had time to grow .",
    "by contrast , the potential wells that attract the ionized particles which then re - scatter cmb have been growing through gravitational instability for some time since entering the horizon .",
    "hence , we do not include the @xmath59 range into our signal - to - noise results .",
    "[ fig : s2n2-stronly ] ] [ fig : s2n2-inflat ] ] [ fig : s2n2-tsky ]    let us turn to our results , shown in fig .",
    "[ bigfig ] , which begin with analysis of a hypothetical universe where inflationary perturbations are not present and cosmic strings are the only source of both cmb and 21  cm anisotropy .",
    "we plot the cross correlation signal - to - noise distribution for this case in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2n2-stronly ] . when only strings are present and noise is disregarded , as we do here , the overall normalization , the string tension @xmath60 , drops out of the signal - to - noise calculation . in this imaginary universe ,",
    "the signal is so strong that an observation at each redshift would generate a detection ( @xmath61 ) .    in the real universe ,",
    "the inflationary perturbations overwhelm those from strings , as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2n2-inflat ] , even without including the detector noise .",
    "no single measurement now has significant signal - to - noise ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "instead , we must sum over many independent redshift bins in order to accumulate a significant signal , giving a statistical detection .",
    "the case presented in this figure represents the best - case scenario : no noise and a maximal , ten percent contribution to primordial anisotropy from strings .",
    "the signal is similar in shape to , though lower in magnitude than , the idealized case of a system seeded only by strings .",
    "the signal is suppressed more significantly on small angular scales , since the inflationary auto - correlations monotonically increases for @xmath6 , while the string - induced signal peaks at @xmath63 .",
    "although any particular observation in the @xmath64 plane will result in a contribution @xmath65 , the statistical benefit of observing roughly @xmath66 multipoles ( @xmath67 , weighted by a factor of @xmath68 ) in roughly @xmath66 redshift bins ( observations with a @xmath69 bandwidth in the range @xmath70 ) gives rise to a total @xmath71 .",
    "summing our simulated data over all @xmath6 and over @xmath72 reveals a @xmath73 .",
    "however , this does not include experimental noise , and corresponds to a survey - strategy parameter of @xmath74 .",
    "[ fig : s2n2-tsky ] shows the remaining signal once the sky temperature is incorporated .",
    "these data were generated assuming an all - sky survey from a single dish of diameter @xmath75 observing for ten years ( @xmath76 ) ; note that sky temperature completely overwhelms the signal for redshift @xmath77 .",
    "the estimated signal - to - noise remaining in our analysis volume is @xmath78 .",
    "finally , let us look at fig .  [ fig : s2n - gmu ] , which summarizes the detectability of our signal for various string tensions , @xmath60 , as a function of our observational parameter , @xmath48 .",
    "it is clear that the noise induced by the large sky temperatures severely limits the possibility of observing a string network through cross - correlation .",
    "however , the calculation reported here does not exhaust the possible locations of cross - correlation signal from strings .",
    "for instance , our estimate is restricted to the domain @xmath79 that we are certain will not be affected by reionization .",
    "our present ignorance about the physics of reionization means that we can not trust our calculation into the @xmath3 range .",
    "this is a major impediment , though : lower @xmath16 is the redshift range least affected by noise , since noise goes as an inverse power law with frequency .",
    "hence , we can hope to boost our signal significantly once the physics of reionization are better understood .",
    "we have also only looked at the cmb-21  cm cross - correlations in this study .",
    "although they are likely very small , we are currently analyzing contributions from the @xmath80 21  cm-21  cm cross - correlations .",
    "these will also give some boost to our signal .",
    "by incorporating the segment model of strings into the camb_sources einstein - boltzmann code , we have calculated the cross correlation between the 21  cm brightness temperature and the cmb .",
    "our chief result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2n - gmu ] , which represents the signal - to - noise available in cmb-21  cm correlation studies given an all - sky survey , a string tension @xmath60 , and our observing strategy , which we characterize by a single integration time and telescope properties parameter , @xmath48 .",
    "unfortunately , noise from the sky temperature overwhelms the signal we are calculating for observationally - allowed cosmic string tensions .    however , there is room for more work .",
    "we have thus far only included the signal from the cmb-21  cm correlations for @xmath79 , where we do not need to know the physics of reionization .",
    "since the signal should extend until the epoch of reionization @xmath81 , we may eventually be able to include @xmath82 more redshift bins and @xmath80 data points in the @xmath64 plane , once we can accurately model reionization .",
    "another contribution to our signal that was neglected in this study can be found from a cross - correlation study between different redshift bins , and this signal will be addressed in future work  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that we will find a detectable signal when these extra sources of data are included in the analysis .",
    "though our calculations have not predicted a detectable signal , we reiterate that any detection of a cross correlation between the 21  cm radiation from @xmath79 and the cmb would be a clear sign of new physics .",
    "active sources , such as cosmic strings , are a promising candidate for the sort of new physics that could generate this correlation .",
    "however , the fact that inflation very likely provides the dominant source of perturbations in the universe makes detectability of any signal difficult : the inflationary perturbations must necessarily enter as `` noise '' for any study like this , and are typically much larger than any alternate sources of perturbation , at least prior to recombination where measurements of the cmb limit any non - inflationary perturbations .",
    "one way around this would be to contrive some active source that was suppressed prior to recombination which subsequently sourced a larger fraction of perturbations in the dark ages .",
    "on the other hand , a non - detection of such a cross correlation would constitute a strong constraint on active sources with such unusual properties .",

    "<S> neutral hydrogen is ubiquitous , absorbing and emitting 21  cm radiation throughout much of the universe s history . </S>",
    "<S> active sources of perturbations , such as cosmic strings , would generate simultaneous perturbations in the distribution of neutral hydrogen and in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation from recombination . </S>",
    "<S> moving strings would create wakes leading to 21  cm brightness fluctuations , while also perturbing cmb light via the gott - kaiser - stebbins effect . </S>",
    "<S> this would lead to spatial correlations between the 21  cm and cmb anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> passive sources , like inflationary perturbations , predict no cross correlations prior to the onset of reionization . thus , observation of any cross correlation between cmb and 21  cm radiation from dark ages would constitute evidence for new physics . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the cosmic string induced correlations between cmb and 21  cm and evaluate their observability . </S>"
