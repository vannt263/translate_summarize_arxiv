    "the pioneering discovery by pareto @xcite is not only an important cue for research in fractal but also a significant issue in economics .",
    "the pareto law states that a cumulative number distribution @xmath0 obeys power - law for income @xmath1 which is larger than a certain observational threshold @xmath2 : @xmath3 where the exponent @xmath4 is called pareto index .",
    "recently pareto s law is checked with high accuracy by using digitalized data @xcite .",
    "although the number of persons or companies in the range where pareto s law ( [ pareto ] ) holds is a few percent , the amount of the income occupies a large part of the total income .",
    "high income persons or high income companies can , therefore , influence economics .",
    "it is quite important to investigate the mechanism which governs them .    the research on the income distribution is well investigated in econophysics @xcite .",
    "many models to explain the distribution are proposed ( for instance recently refs .",
    "furthermore , fujiwara et al .",
    "@xcite find that , without assuming any model , pareto s law can be derived kinematically from the law of detailed balance and gibrat s law @xcite which are observed in high quality digitalized data .",
    "they derive not only pareto s law but also the reflection law which correlates a positive growth rate distribution to negative one by the pareto index @xmath4 .",
    "this means that pareto s law and index are explained by the law of detailed balance and gibrat s law .",
    "we should note that these arguments are limited in the high income region ( @xmath5 ) .    the findings in ref .",
    "@xcite are quite fascinating especially in the idea that the pareto index can be understood by the growth rate distribution . in this paper",
    ", we first investigate the application as follows .",
    "the distribution of high income companies follows pareto s law and the pareto index is about @xmath6 .",
    "this is called zipf s law @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the distributions in most job categories follow pareto s law .",
    "those pareto indices , however , scatter around @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we examine the reflection law that relates the change of the pareto index to the change of the growth rate distribution in job categories .",
    "there is , however , a problem in estimating the pareto index by the growth rate distribution in each job category .",
    "the number of companies in several job classes is not enough to observe the reflection law .",
    "we clear this difficulty by employing profits data which have no threshold in contrast to high income data announced publicly .    by observing all positive profits data , we confirm the law of detailed balance .",
    "we also find that gibrat s law holds in the region where the only initial profits are conditioned to be larger than the threshold . in this case ,",
    "pareto s law is also obtained and the reflection law can be observed in companies data classified into job categories . using these arguments , we confirm the correlation between the pareto index and the growth rate distribution .",
    "in addition , we find that companies in a small scale job category have more possibilities of growing profits than those in a large scale job category .",
    "this kinematically explains that the pareto index for the companies in the small job class is larger than that for the companies in the large scale job class , which is reported in ref .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the proof that the detailed balance and gibrat s law lead to pareto s law and the reflection law @xcite .    let the income at two successive points in time be denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "growth rate @xmath9 is defined as the ratio @xmath10 .",
    "the detailed balance and gibrat s law can be summarized as follows .",
    "* detailed balance ( time - reversal symmetry ) + the joint probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath11 is symmetric : @xmath12 * gibrat s law + the conditional probability distribution of growth rate @xmath13 is independent of the initial value @xmath7 : @xmath14 where @xmath13 is defined by using the pdf @xmath15 and the joint pdf @xmath16 as @xmath17    these phenomenological properties , for example , are observed in the data of high income japanese companies in 2002 and 2003 . in japan , companies having annual income more than 40 million yen are announced publicly as `` high income companies '' every year .",

    "the pareto indices @xmath4 are very close to @xmath6 , and the case is often referred to as zipf s law @xcite .",
    "we also examine gibrat s law in the regime ( [ income_condition ] ) . here",

    "[ incomegrowthrate ] , the probability density for @xmath22 is expressed for each bin . in all the cases ,",
    "all the probability density distributions for different @xmath23 collapse on a single curve approximately .",
    "this means that the distribution for the growth rate @xmath22 is approximately independent of the initial value @xmath7 . here",
    "the probability density for @xmath22 defined by @xmath24 is related to that for @xmath9 by @xmath25    pareto s law ( [ pareto ] ) can be derived from the detailed balance ( [ detailed balance ] ) and gibrat s law ( [ gibrat ] ) without assuming any model @xcite . due to the relation of @xmath26 under the change of variables from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , these two joint pdf s",

    "there is , however , a difficulty in measuring the slope @xmath48 of the reflected line ( [ rline ] ) .",

    "the possibility of growing down is independent of the scale of the job category for high profits companies , @xmath65 . as a result ,",
    "the relation ( [ mu ] ) explains that the pareto index for the companies in the small scale job category is larger than that for the companies in the large scale job category .",
    "in this paper , we have first shown that the pareto index can be estimated by profits growth rate distribution of companies in japan .",

    "the relation between the average capital and the pareto index is also verified .",
    "consequently it is kinematically explained that the pareto index for the companies in the small scale job category is larger than that for the companies in the large scale job category .",
    "we have concentrated our attention to the region ( @xmath57 , @xmath68 ) in order to examine gibrat s law . beyond this regime ,",
