    "as is well - known , the electric field of a laser pulse given by @xmath1 can be characterized by its amplitude @xmath2 , its carrier envelope @xmath3 , its frequency @xmath4 , and its carrier - envelope phase ( cep ) @xmath5 .",
    "the cep is the most difficult parameter to control and even to measure .",
    "recently , a lot of research has been devoted to the cep .",
    "namely , the cep strongly affects many processes involving ultrashort few - cycle pulses  @xcite .",
    "in particular , cep effects on high - harmonic generation @xcite , strong - field photoionization @xcite , the dissociation of hd@xmath6 and h@xmath7 @xcite , the electron dynamics in a strong magnetic field @xcite , the population inversion during a quantum transition @xcite , and the external- and internal- photo - effect currents @xcite have been demonstrated by few - cycle pulses .    for longer laser pulses , the influence of the cep becomes smaller ( very often it is beyond the experimental abilities to be measured ) .",
    "so the important question is what is the maximal duration of laser pulses that can still have the cep effects ? it is a fundamental question , but also it brings new interesting possibilities to measure and control parameters of laser pulses and applications . a stabilized and adjustable cep is important for applications such as optical frequency combs @xcite and quantum control in various media @xcite .",
    "several techniques have been developed to control the cep of femtosecond pulses @xcite .",
    "a crucial step in attaining this control is measuring the cep to provide feedback to the laser system .",
    "promising approaches for short pulses use , for instance , photoionization @xcite and quantum interference in semiconductors @xcite .    for longer pulses , on the other hand ,",
    "there are no such methods .",
    "recently , a method has been presented for the measurement of the absolute cep of a high - power , many - cycle driving pulse , by measuring the variation of the xuv spectrum  @xcite by applying the interferometric polarization gating technique to such pulses  @xcite .",
    "we stress here that extending the cep control to longer pulses creates interesting possibilities to generate pulses with accuracy that is better than the period of optical oscillation .",
    "first , it allows researchers to improve laser systems that generate laser pulses with better reproducibility and accuracy and better controlled .",
    "second , it provides an additional handle to control the process of collisions .",
    "femtosecond pulses are shorter than the time duration of collisions and can not be used to study collisions under the action of electromagnetic fields ; meanwhile the current approach of extending the duration of the pulses with measureable or controllable cep allows researchers to extend the coherent control to a new level when they are able to study molecular collisions or electron collisions in nanostructures under the action of strong electromagnetic fields with known cep .",
    "electromagnetically induced magnetochiral anisotropy in a resonant medium demonstrated in @xcite can be enhanced by the control of the cep of optical radiation in the laser induced chemical reactions  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report the cep effects in the population transfer between two bound atomic states interacting with pulses consisting many cycles in contrast with few - cycle pulses  @xcite . for our experiment",
    ", we use intense radio - frequency ( rf ) pulses interacting with the magnetic zeeman sub - levels of rubidium ( rb ) atoms .",
    "we have found that , for long pulses consisting two carrier frequencies , the cep of the pulse strongly affects that transfer .",
    "it is worth noting here that our scheme has no limitation on the duration of pulses .",
    "the significance of our experiment is that it provides the insight of cep effect in a new regime .",
    "the experiment is the first , to our knowledge , to observe the cep effect on a transition between two _ bound _ atomic states with such _ long _ pulses .",
