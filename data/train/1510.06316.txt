    "in 1998 , the discovery of the @xmath1 was reported by the cdf collaboration in the @xmath9 process at fermilab @xcite .",
    "about 10 years later , the cdf collaboration confirmed the existence of @xmath1 via the decay mode @xmath10 at cdf ii with a significance of more than @xmath11 @xcite . additionally , the d0 collaboration observed the @xmath1 states in the @xmath10 process with a significance of more than @xmath12 @xcite . in the last two years",
    ", the @xmath1 state has also been observed by the lhcb collaboration with the decay modes @xmath10 and @xmath13 at the lhc center - of - mass energy 7 tev of proton - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "the average value for the mass of the @xmath1 state listed in the particle data group ( pdg ) is @xmath14 gev @xcite .",
    "another state related to our work is the @xmath0 resonance , of which we will give a brief review next .",
    "the scalar resonance @xmath0 was first observed by babar collaboration as a narrow peak in the inclusive @xmath15 annihilation process @xcite .",
    "later , this observation was confirmed by cleo , belle and focus collaborations @xcite .",
    "the average mass of @xmath0 listed in the pdg is @xmath16 mev @xcite .    before the babar experiment , the potential model @xcite and lattice qcd @xcite studied the p - wave charmed strange meson and predicted a meson mass larger than the experimental value , and a width of the @xmath17 decay very large .",
    "after the babar experiment , many theoretical groups performed research on the @xmath0 state . since the mass of the @xmath0 is close to the threshold of the @xmath5 system , being the difference of about 50 mev , the molecular state interpretation was proposed @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0 state was studied in the frame of @xmath18 mixing with @xmath4 state , four - quark state , and the mixture of two - meson and four - quark state . in refs .",
    "@xcite , introducing @xmath18 meson operators and using the effective range formula , the authors obtained a bound state about @xmath19 mev below the @xmath18 threshold , which was reanalysed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , lattice qcd results for the @xmath5 scattering length were extrapolated to physical pion masses by means of unitarized chiral perturbation theory , and by means of the weinberg compositeness condition @xcite the amount of @xmath18 content in the @xmath0 was determined , resulting in a sizable fraction of the order of @xmath20 within errors .",
    "is done in @xcite . ]    in the present work , we shall give the @xmath5 invariant mass distribution in the decay @xmath7 , from which information on the internal structure of the @xmath0 state will be obtained .",
    "besides the weak decay of the @xmath1 meson and hadronization of the quark - antiquark pair to two mesons , the final state interaction is involved . in order to describe the final state interaction , by which the @xmath0 state is generated , we use the chiral unitary approach which makes use of the on - shell version of the factorized bethe - salpeter equation which has successfully explained the existence of some resonances ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the formalism to study the decay of @xmath7 and @xmath21 .",
    "the numerical results of the @xmath5 invariant mass distribution are given in section iii .",
    "finally , we present a brief conclusion .",
    "in this paper , we will discuss the decay mechanism of the @xmath1 meson into @xmath2 and also into @xmath22 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the weak decay mechanisms of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 mesons were studied .",
    "we can take many elements from those works , but there are also some important differences . the works of @xcite relied upon the topological diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : bc_to_jpsi_csbar ] , which we have adapted to the present problem .",
    "essentially a @xmath25 quark from the @xmath26 meson is replaced now by a @xmath27 quark in the @xmath28 case here .",
    "this diagram is addressed as internal emission in the nomenclature of ref .",
    "however we can also have a mechanism of external emission as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bccsbarccbar ] .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] we plot @xmath29 of eq .",
    "( [ 3b ] ) .",
    "we see a fall down of the distribution as a function of the @xmath30 invariant mass .",
    "this is a clear indication of the presence of a resonance below threshold since we have divided the original invariant mass distribution by the phase space .",
    "hence , essentially we are plotting @xmath31 , which peaks at the mass of the @xmath0 and we are seeing the tail of the resonance .      at this point",
    "we would like to consider uncertainties tied to the possibility that the state @xmath33 contains some @xmath32 component in addition to the @xmath18 and @xmath34 molecular channels .",
    "this possibility was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite when analyzing the lattice qcd spectra for @xmath18 and related channels , including @xmath32 components .",
    "the analysis to account for a possible @xmath32 component was done by adding a castillejo - dalitz - dyson pole @xcite to the potential .",
    "hence , in the charge basis that we consider , we add to the potential of eq .",
    "an extra component @xmath35 where the equality of these terms guarantees that we have @xmath36 and we have only considered the extra term in the important @xmath18 channels , as in @xcite . in eq .",
    "@xmath37 is a constant and @xmath38 would be associated to a bare mass of some excited @xmath32 component . with the potential @xmath39",
    "we reevaluate amplitudes and couplings . the analysis done in @xcite gave as an output that the possible values of @xmath38 were larger than @xmath40 mev .",
    "we choose @xmath41 mev , but we have checked that the results do not change if we have a larger @xmath38 mass after the fitting is done . the procedure to determine the @xmath37 parameter is the following .",
    "first we quote from ref .",
    "@xcite that the probability to have the @xmath18 component was , summing errors in quadrature , @xmath42 .",
    "hence we take three cases , corresponding to @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 . for each of these cases",
    "we make a fit of the subtraction constant @xmath46 of eq . and @xmath37 to obtain the binding at 2317.8 mev and @xmath47 equal to any of the former fractions .",
    "the @xmath47 probability is given by @xcite @xmath48 with @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "next we take into account that the new component not only modifies couplings and amplitudes of @xmath18 but in the decay that we consider there can be a direct coupling to this component .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : coalescence ] ( a ) for the coalescence process and in fig .",
    "[ fig : coalescence ] ( b ) for the @xmath50 production .",
    "we must add this contribution to the former one , but we have here two extra couplings which are unknown , the @xmath51 coupling to the @xmath32 component and the resonance coupling to this component .",
    "let us write the product of the two in terms of an unknown constant @xmath52 , as @xmath53 for dimensional reasons .",
    "then the amplitudes equivalent to eq . and",
    "are now : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the mass of the @xmath56 .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 is unknown , but with @xmath18 and @xmath34 nearly exhausting the sum rule @xmath57 , we shall choose it in such a way that the @xmath52-term in eq .",
    "gives a weight of @xmath58 , @xmath59 or @xmath60 of the @xmath61 term . with this the relative strength of this term on @xmath62 , and hence in @xmath63 , would be @xmath58 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "we think this is a wide margin given the small room left for such component in the sum rule .",
    "we should expect this contribution to be of the order of the uncertainty of @xmath66 in @xmath47 that we have quoted before , but we take a wider margin .",
    "when this is done we get the results that we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : new_ratio ] . compared to the former results in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , we see small changes . for weight @xmath67 in fig . [",
    "fig : new_ratio ] ( b ) where @xmath68 we get a reduction of @xmath29 about @xmath69 with respect to the former results .",
    "for the case that the relative weight of the new component is @xmath59 in the amplitude we get results about @xmath70 bigger than before . and for relative weight 0.2 we get an increase of about @xmath71 .",
    "we also can see in figs .",
    "[ fig : new_ratio ] ( a ) and ( c ) for weights @xmath72 and @xmath73 that the results change only in about @xmath70 with respect to those for @xmath74 .",
    "this is a margin of uncertainty that we can assume , but the main features discussed above remain .",
    "in this paper we have studied the @xmath75 decay into @xmath76 .",
    "the mechanism is : @xmath75 decays into @xmath3 and the quark pair @xmath4 via weak interaction ; then the quark pair @xmath4 hadronizes into @xmath77 , @xmath78 or @xmath79 components which can interact among themselves generating the @xmath0 resonance . in the scheme of the chiral unitary approach , we are able to choose the proper parameters @xmath46 and @xmath80 appearing in the loop function by matching the pole position of the @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath81 and @xmath82 gev , the couplings of @xmath5 and @xmath6 channels are @xmath83 gev and @xmath84 gev , respectively .",
    "later we have calculated the differential decay width of the reaction @xmath85 .",
    "one can appreciate that the shape of the distribution peaks closer to the @xmath5 threshold than the phase space , indicating the coupling of @xmath5 to a resonance below threshold ( the @xmath0 in this case ) .",
    "we also evaluated the rate of production of the @xmath0 resonance and then constructed the ratio of @xmath86 to the width for @xmath0 production , where the unknown factor @xmath87 of our theory cancels .",
    "the new normalized distribution obtained is then a prediction of the theory , only tied to the fact that the @xmath0 is dynamically generated from the @xmath5 and @xmath34 channels .",
    "we also evaluated the possible contribution of genuine @xmath32 components taking information from the lattice qcd results and found it to be small .",
    "as to the feasibility of the reaction we think this is at reach in present facilities . indeed in the pdg @xcite one finds half of the known decay channels of the @xmath28 going to a @xmath3 , one has also decays into @xmath3 and three pions , @xmath3 plus two kaons and one pion , and also decays into @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the study done here , showing how one can learn about the nature of the @xmath0 from the measurements proposed , should serve as an incentive to perform these experiments in the near future .",
