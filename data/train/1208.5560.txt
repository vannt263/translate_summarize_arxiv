    "g346.6@xmath00.2 is a supernova remnant ( snr ) discovered in the radio band @xcite .",
    "the radio image shows a shell structure with the size of @xmath38@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "flux densities at 408 mhz , 843 mhz , 1.47 ghz , and 5 ghz were measured to be 14.9 jy , 8.7 jy , 8.1 jy , and 4.3 jy , respectively ( @xcite and references therein ) , then the spectral index was estimated to be 0.5 @xcite .",
    "the snr would be interacted with a molecular cloud because an oh maser was found @xcite .",
    "the galactic plane survey project with asca discovered a faint x - ray emission from g346.6@xmath00.2 for the first time @xcite .",
    "the asca gis image showed the diffuse x - ray morphology in the radio shell .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was represented by either a thermal plasma model with a temperature of @xmath31.6 kev or a power - law model with a photon index of @xmath33.7 .",
    "the absorption was as large as @xmath4(23)@xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite , which suggested that the snr is located at a long distance , possibly in the galactic inner disk or further .",
    "no further quantitative constraint was available with the asca data due to the limited photon statistics .",
    "g346.6@xmath00.2 was then observed with suzaku .",
    "@xcite found strong emission lines of si and s , and fitted the x - ray spectrum with a model of a power - law ( photon index @xmath30.6 ) plus a non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) ( ionizing ) plasma .",
    "they predicted that the strong si and s lines are due to an ejecta - dominated plasma which originated from a type ia supernova explosion , and the power - law component is regarded as synchrotron emission .",
    "recently , strong radiative recombination continua ( rrcs ) have been discovered in the x - ray spectra of five mixed - morphology ( mm ) snrs @xcite .",
    "the rrc originates from radiative transitions of free electrons to the k - shell of ions , a sign of a recombination dominant plasma ( rp ) . in the residuals of the nei model fit for g346.6@xmath00.2 in @xcite",
    ", we see a similar structure to the rrc .",
    "g346.6@xmath00.2 is located on the galactic ridge , where a strong x - ray emission , called the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) , is prevailing .",
    "however , the previous data reduction and analyses did not properly take account of the grxe as a major background for the faint and diffuse source .",
    "we , therefore , revisited the suzaku data and performed the data reduction , spectral construction , and spectral analysis paying particular concerns on the subtraction of the grxe .",
    "we then discovered evidence for the recombining plasma from this mm snr for the first time .",
    "( 17cm,8cm)fig1.eps    suzaku @xcite carried out the galactic center / plane mapping project with the ccd cameras ( xis , @xcite ) placed at the focal planes of the thin foil x - ray telescopes ( xrt , @xcite ) .",

    "therefore , the contribution of the grxe , particular in the hard x - ray band above 5  kev , has a large impact on the source spectrum .",
    "although the surface brightness of the grxe is nearly constant along the galactic plane within the range of a few degree of the galactic longitude , the latitudinal variation is large , which is given by an exponential function with the scale height of @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we , therefore , selected two background regions for the spectrum of g346.6@xmath00.2 ; one is the surrounding region of g346.6@xmath00.2 in the same field of view ( fov ) ( hereafter bgd - a ) and the other is a nearby region at ( @xmath7 , @xmath8)=(344@xmath9.26 , @xmath00@xmath9.22 ) ( obs .",

    "the fe k - line emission at 6.7 kev is due to the grxe , and the line intensities are also comparable between the source and two background spectra . we , therefore , conclude that after the subtraction of the proper background of the grxe and the cxb , g346.6@xmath00.2 should have no significant x - rays above @xmath35  kev .",

    "these error ranges mean that the initial plasma of @xmath25 is in nearly full ionized state for all the relevant elements except for fe ( fe would be in between full ionized and h - like states ) . taking account of the initial plasma condition",

    "our present result of bgd - a is @xmath32 times larger than bgd - b in the soft x - ray band , and hence the excess would not be due to the fluctuation of the grxe , but would be a local plasma . the @xmath14 value of the local plasma is smaller than that of g346.6@xmath00.2 in the grxe , hence this emission is located at the near side of g346.6@xmath00.2 and the grxe .",
    "the local plasma is near to the direction of the non - thermal snr rx j1713.7@xmath03946 and the @xmath14 value is similar to that of rx j1713.7@xmath03946 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the local plasma is located near rx j1713.7@xmath03946 at the distance of 12 kpc . whether this thermal plasma is physically associated with rx j1713.7@xmath03946 or not is unclear . to clarify this , we encourage further observations around rx j1713.7@xmath03946 .",
