    "modern metamaterials offer remarkable control over electromagnetic fields @xcite with applications ranging from future invisibility devices @xcite-@xcite to existing perfect lenses @xcite-@xcite .",
    "imagine there were no practical limits on the electromagnetic properties of materials .",
    "given a desired function , how do we find the design of the device that turns this function into fact ?",
    "in this paper , we show that general relativity provides clear recipes for calculating the required material properties .",
    "the practical use of general relativity in electrical engineering may seem surprising : relativity has been associated with the physics of gravitation @xcite and cosmology @xcite or , in engineering @xcite , has been considered a complication , not a simplification .",
    "but the design concept described here is rooted in a simple idea with a distinguished history : according to fermat s principle @xcite light rays follow the shortest optical paths in media ; they are effective geodesics , and general relativity has developed the theoretical tools for fields in curved geometries @xcite .",
    "of course , here we exploit only some of the aspects of general relativity : we use the physics of curved space , but not the physics @xcite that creates space - time curvature in gravity . in our case ,",
    "electromagnetic metamaterials , not masses , create effective geometries .",
    "our theory generalizes the concept behind the proposed perfect invisibility devices @xcite to magneto - electric or moving media and it incorporates negative refraction @xcite-@xcite . for example , using a simple pictorial argument we show how to design magnifying perfect lenses .",
    "finally , metamaterials may be also applied for laboratory analogs of general relativity , in particular for artificial black holes @xcite-@xcite . in this way , we unify and generalize a range of physical phenomena that rely on the geometry of media and the recent opportunities of metamaterials .",
    "metamaterials are materials with designed properties that stem from structure , not substance ; where man - made structures determine the electromagnetic properties , structures that are smaller than the electromagnetic wavelengths involved .",
    "metamaterials have a long history : mediaeval ruby glass , for example , is a metamaterial .",
    "ruby glass contains nano - scale gold colloids that render the glass neither golden nor transparent , but ruby , depending on the size and concentration of the gold droplets .",
    "the color originates from a resonance of the surface plasmons @xcite on the metallic droplets .",
    "metamaterials _ per se _ are nothing new : what is new is the degree of control over the structures in the material that generate the desired properties . for example , in the modern version of negatively - refracting ruby glass @xcite nano - manufactured pairs of gold - pillars on a silicon substrate generate finely - tuned plasmon resonances where each pair acts like a designer atom with controllable properties .",
    "our starting point is not new either : in the early 1920 s gordon @xcite noticed that moving isotropic media appear to electromagnetic fields as certain effective space - time geometries .",
    "tamm @xcite generalized this geometric approach to anisotropic media and briefly applied this theory @xcite to the propagation of light in curved geometries . in 1960",
    "plebanski @xcite formulated the electromagnetic effect of curved space - time or curved coordinates in concise constitutive equations .",
    "dielectric media act on electromagnetic fields as geometries and geometries act as effective media . in 2000",
    "it was understood @xcite that the dipole forces of electromagnetic fields in media appear as the effects of geometries as well , electromagnetic fields act as geometries on media , a concept used to identify the conditions for the abraham or the minkowski momentum in media @xcite .",
    "only very recently @xcite-@xcite meta - material implementations of coordinate transformations were considered as engineering tools , ideas we take further here : we show that general relativity lends the most natural recipes for such engineering applications .",
    "a geometry is characterized by the space - time measure @xcite @xmath0 , the metric , where we denote the space - time coordinates by @xmath1 with greek indices running from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "latin indices indicate the spatial coordinates and run from @xmath4 to @xmath3 , whereas @xmath5 describes time measured in spatial units with @xmath6 being the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the matrix @xmath7 , the metric tensor , may vary as a function of the coordinates , because space - time may be curved or because curved coordinates are used in flat space .",
    "the determinant @xmath8 of @xmath7 measures the 4d volume of an infinitesimal space - time element as @xmath9 times the infinitesimal coordinate volume @xcite .",
    "we denote the matrix inverse of @xmath7 by @xmath10 ; where , as customary in general relativity @xcite , the position of the indices indicates that @xmath7 is co - variant and @xmath10 is contra - variant under coordinate transformations .",
    "for example , flat space in cylindrical coordinates @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is described by the metric tensor @xmath15 with matrix inverse @xmath16 and determinant @xmath17 .",
    "as our starting point , we use the result of general relativity @xcite , derived in appendix a , that the free - space maxwell equations can be written in the macroscopic form @xcite @xmath18 or , in cartesian components , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the completely antisymmetric levi - civita tensor @xcite : in cartesian components @xmath20 is @xmath4 for all cyclic permutations of @xmath21 , @xmath22 for all cyclic permutations of @xmath23 and @xmath2 otherwise .",
    "the spatial indices indicate that in this representation @xmath24 and @xmath25 form the components of vectors that are co - variant under purely spatial transformations , whereas @xmath26 and @xmath27 constitute contra - variant spatial vectors .",
    "the charge density @xmath28 and the current density @xmath29 are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the four - current @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "in empty but possibly curved space , the electromagnetic fields are connected by the constitutive equations in si units @xcite , @xmath33 in dielectric media , the @xmath34 , @xmath35 vectors generate electric polarizations and magnetizations that constitute the @xmath36 , @xmath37 fields .",
    "the constitutive equations are described here in implicit form , but one can also express them as @xmath36 , @xmath37 as functions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "in general , the electric permittivity @xmath38 and the magnetic permeability @xmath39 are symmetric matrices  space - time appears as an anisotropic medium  but , in empty space , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are equal , as in perfect impedance matching @xcite .",
    "the @xmath40 vector describes a magneto - electric coupling between the magnetic and the electric fields .",
    "some materials are magneto - electric , but the simplest example is a moving medium @xcite , because a moving medium responds to the electromagnetic field in locally co - moving frames and lorentz transformations from the laboratory frame naturally mix electric and magnetic fields @xcite . in explicit form @xcite , @xmath41 the @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "are constructed from the spatial components of the inverse metric tensor and from the determinant and the time - time component of the metric tensor , whereas the @xmath40 vector is given in terms of the time - space components of the metric tensor .",
    "empty space appears as an impedance - matched anisotropic magneto - electric or moving medium .      since empty space appears as a medium , what happens if a medium appears as empty space",
    "this is the idea behind the recent proposals for invisibility devices @xcite-@xcite . to be more precise ,",
    "suppose that the medium appears as the result of a coordinate transformation from some fictitious space - time , say electromagnetic space - time , to physical space , see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinates ] .",
    "electromagnetic space - time could be flat with light traveling along straight lines , whereas to electromagnetic fields physical space appears to be curved , bending light .",
    "of course , this apparent curvature is an illusion , the same type of illusion as straight lines appearing curved in curved coordinates , because in theory it is removable by the inverse coordinate transformation : but , in practice , one can exploit this apparent curvature to create illusions @xcite-@xcite .    ]",
    "we use primes to denote the geometry and coordinates of electromagnetic space - time and describe physical space in generalized coordinates @xmath42 with spatial metric @xmath43 and determinant @xmath44 , for keeping the theory as flexible as possible .",
    "for example , we may wish to use cylindrical coordinates @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 with spatial metric tensor @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the metric @xmath43 should differ from the effective geometry @xmath7 generated by the medium .",
    "the transformation rules of tensors in general relativity give rise to a simple recipe for the construction of media that facilitate space - time coordinate transformations .",
    "contra - variant tensors are transformed as @xcite @xmath47 the transformed inverse metric serves as the building block of the dielectric tensors ( [ eq : constrel ] ) of the medium .",
    "if we wish to express physical space in generalized coordinates , we need to consider a subtlety that appears when we write the divergences in maxwell s equations ( [ eq : maxdiv ] ) in spatially co - variant form @xcite @xmath48 the @xmath49 and @xmath50 tensors are naturally contra - variant with respect to the background geometry of physical space , but @xmath44 differs from @xmath51 , in general .",
    "consequently , for writing the medium as an active coordinate transformation , we need to multiply @xmath36 and @xmath35 by @xmath52 in the constitutive equations ( [ eq : constitution ] ) and re - scale @xmath28 and @xmath29 accordingly , which is also consistent with the form of the levi - civita tensor in curved coordinates @xcite in the curls in maxwell s equations ( [ eq : maxcurl ] ) .",
    "however , a second subtlety arises from the curls : the coordinate transformation may turn a right - handed coordinate system into a locally left - handed one , but the curls ( [ eq : maxcurl ] ) implicitly assume a right - handed system , because @xmath20 changes sign under coordinate transformations from right to left - handed systems .",
    "consequently , we need to invert the sign of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 wherever this is the case .",
    "the transformation to a left - handed coordinate system thus corresponds to negative refraction @xcite occurring in what has , for other reasons @xcite , been fittingly described as left - handed media .",
    "taking all this into account , we arrive at the simple recipe @xmath53 the @xmath54 sign indicates the handedness : minus for right - handed transformations and plus for locally left - handed ones . starting from the inverse metric @xmath55 in electromagnetic space",
    ", the @xmath10 matrix is calculated according to the transformation rule ( [ eq : rule ] ) .",
    "the matrix inverse of @xmath10 gives the metric tensor @xmath7 and the inverse of the determinant of @xmath10 gives @xmath8 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : recipe ] ) specify the required electromagnetic properties that will turn the coordinate transformation into reality . in the special case of right - handed and purely spatial transformations",
    "our recipe agrees with the theory of refs .",
    "@xcite , see appendix b , where however , instead of the contra - variant @xmath38 and @xmath39 mixed tensors occur with one of the indices lowered by the spatial metric , @xmath56 here we consider more general transformations that may mix space and time and that may be multivalued . as long as the matrix ( [ eq : rule ] ) is single - valued and not explicitly time - dependent such a device is physically allowed and stationary .",
    "the coordinate transformation encodes the function of the device . outside of it ,",
    "the electromagnetic coordinates agree with the coordinates of physical space : the transformation is trivial ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 are unity and @xmath40 vanishes . inside the device , electromagnetic fields",
    "are controlled as prescribed by the coordinate transformation .",
    "if the physical coordinates enclose a hole one obtains the blueprint of an invisibility device @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we show in the next section that perfect lensing @xcite-@xcite , the optical aharonov - bohm effect @xcite and optical black holes @xcite-@xcite can be understood as applications of the same idea as well .",
    "perfect invisibility devices @xcite facilitate coordinate transformations with holes in physical space . in this way",
    ", electromagnetic radiation is naturally guided around such excluded regions .",
    "anything placed inside is hidden .",
    "perfect invisibility devices @xcite must employ anisotropic media , because the inverse scattering problem for waves in isotropic media has unique solutions @xcite . they also require media where the phase velocity of light approaches infinity at the inside of the cloaking layer , because coordinate transformations with holes rip apart points of zero volume in electromagnetic space and tear them to finite volumes in physical space , unless the coordinate transformation is singular . to prove this , consider the determinant of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 tensor ( [ eq : recipe ] ) . for an invisibility device @xcite only space is transformed , so @xmath40 vanishes , @xmath57 is unity and @xmath51 is reduced to the inverse of the determinant of the spatial components @xmath58 .",
    "we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rule ] ) and ( [ eq : recipe ] ) in three - dimensional space @xmath59 in terms of the jacobian @xmath60 @xcite . at a point of measure zero",
    "@xmath61 vanishes and so does @xmath62 , the product of the eigenvalues of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "consequently , at least one of the eigenvalues of @xmath38 and @xmath39 are zero ; therefore in at least one direction of the anisotropic medium the phase - velocity of light diverges near the inside of the cloak .",
    "the speed of light in media can reach high values in narrow frequency ranges or , naturally , for static fields . on the other hand , invisibility devices that are only perfect within the limits of geometrical optics @xcite are not subject to such constraints @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : invisibility ] illustrates a cylindrical invisibility device that stretches the @xmath14 axis out in the radial direction to a full cylinder of radius @xmath63 , compressed within a cylindrical volume of radius @xmath64 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinates ] .",
    "this device is an invisibility cloak of thickness @xmath65 where anything placed inside the inner radius @xmath63 is hidden .",
    "we obtain from the theory @xmath66 within @xmath67 or , equivalently , @xmath68 .",
    "clearly , close to the lining of the cloak at @xmath69 where @xmath70 the speed of light in the @xmath12 and @xmath14 directions diverges , whereas in @xmath13 direction the phase velocity tends to zero .    ]      in perfect invisibility devices , electromagnetic space does not cover the entire physical space : here we show that perfect lenses correspond to multi - valued electromagnetic space .",
    "consider in cartesian coordinates the multi - valued transformation @xmath71 illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lens ] , whereas all other coordinates are not changed . in the fold of the function",
    "@xmath71 a point @xmath72 in electromagnetic space has three faithful images in physical space .",
    "obviously , electromagnetic fields at one of those points are perfectly imaged onto the other : the device is a perfect lens @xcite .",
    "this simple pictorial argument may contribute to settling the debate on perfect lensing @xcite-@xcite in addition to the experimental proof for enhanced imaging in existing perfect lenses @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our theory also shows why perfect lensing requires left - handed media with negative @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite : inside the device , _ i.e. _ inside of the @xmath72 fold , the derivative of @xmath71 becomes negative and the coordinate system changes handedness .",
    "we obtain from our recipe ( [ eq : recipe ] ) the compact result @xmath73 if , for example , @xmath74 is @xmath22 inside the device and @xmath75 outside , we obtain the standard perfect lens @xcite-@xcite based on an isotropic left - handed material with @xmath76 inside ; but this is not the most general choice .",
    "one could use an anisotropic medium to magnify perfect images , in contrast to the existing examples @xcite-@xcite , by embedding the source or the image in transformation media with @xmath77 .    ]",
    "perfect invisibility devices and perfect lenses exploit transformation media with non - trivial topology , with excluded regions in physical space or folds in electromagnetic space . here",
    "we consider an example where physical space is multi - valued , but the medium is single - valued and hence physically allowed : the optical aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "one can demonstrate this effect with light passing through a water vortex @xcite or with slow light in bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "note that the effect is related to the aharonov - bohm effect with surface waves @xcite-@xcite and to the gravitational aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "the optical aharonov - bohm effect is an example of a transformation medium that mixes space and time , and yet the medium is stationary .",
    "consider in cylindrical coordinates the transformation @xmath78 with the constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we obtain from our theory ( [ eq : recipe ] ) that the medium is isotropic with refractive index @xmath79 and is magneto - electric with @xmath81 , which corresponds to a fluid vortex with velocity profile @xmath82 , as we see comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : constitution ] ) with the constitutive equations of moving media @xcite in lowest relativistic order .",
    "normally , a moving medium fresnel - drags light @xcite , but in the case of a vortex , light rays follow straight lines , because the transformation ( [ eq : ab ] ) changes only time , such that straight rays in electromagnetic space are mapped onto straight lines in physical space .",
    "similarly , in the original aharonov - bohm effect @xcite electron rays are not bent by a magnetic vortex , but they develop a phase slip in the direction of incidence . in our case , when the light has passed the vortex , the time change in the transformation ( [ eq : ab ] ) results in a phase slip of @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the wave number , depending on whether the light propagates with or against the current , see fig .  [ fig : ab ] .",
    "physical space - time is multi - valued , with a branch cut in the direction of incidence , resembling the infinitely sheeted riemann surfaces around a logarithmic branch point @xcite , but the medium is single - valued and has the simple physical interpretation of a moving fluid forming a vortex .    ]",
    "moving isotropic media generate the effective space - time geometry discovered by gordon in 1923 @xcite .",
    "consider an effectively one - dimensional situation where the medium is moving in @xmath85 direction and the electromagnetic field varies along the @xmath85 axis with field vectors pointing orthogonal to @xmath85 .",
    "an impedance - matched medium of refractive index @xmath79 and velocity @xmath86 is described by the inverse metric tensor @xcite @xmath87 both the velocity @xmath86 and the index @xmath79 may vary . we show that this effective geometry is generated from empty space by the coordinate transformation @xmath88 as long as we restrict our attention to fields varying in @xmath85 direction . for this",
    ", we use the transformation rule ( [ eq : rule ] ) , but from un - primed to primed space - time , and find that @xmath89 in electromagnetic space - time , we are free to apply the recipe ( [ eq : recipe ] ) for assigning the medium properties as well as in physical space .",
    "we find @xmath90 in the directions orthogonal to @xmath85 and @xmath91 : vacuum , which proves our point . here",
    "wave packets are superpositions of waves propagating in positive or negative direction as functions of either @xmath92 or @xmath93 .",
    "substituting for @xmath94 the representations ( [ eq : moving ] ) as functions of @xmath11 and @xmath85 , we obtain the electromagnetic waves in physical space .",
    "the transformation ( [ eq : moving ] ) describes the relativistic addition theorem of velocities @xcite for the medium and light propagating in positive or negative direction .",
    "interesting phenomena occur when the velocity of the medium , @xmath86 , reaches the speed of light in the medium , @xmath95 , which is possible in theory and perhaps also in practice . in this case , the integral in @xmath94 develops a logarithmic singularity .",
    "light propagating against the current freezes with exponentially increasing oscillations at a horizon @xcite , see fig .  [ fig : horizon ] .",
    "this horizon is completely analogous to the event horizon of the black hole if the light is escaping from a superluminal region and to a white hole if the light is attempting to enter a counter - propagating superluminal medium @xcite .",
    "horizons cut physical space - time into distinct regions without possible communication .",
    "they correspond to disconnected branches of multi - valued electromagnetic space , covering it multiple times , in contrast to the case of perfect lensing where the folds are connected .",
    "horizons are predicted to exhibit remarkable quantum effects @xcite , in particular hawking radiation @xcite , that are extremely difficult to observe in astronomy , but may possibly be demonstrated in laboratory analogs @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our method suggests a magneto - electric analog of the event horizon , perhaps with metamaterials , if we interpret the effective geometry ( [ eq : gordon ] ) as generating the constitutive equations ( [ eq : constitution ] ) expressed in terms of the @xmath96 and @xmath97 fields as @xmath98 here the functions @xmath79 and @xmath86 of the moving medium appear as parameters of a magneto - electric material at rest .",
    "the material establishes horizons at @xmath99 without singular dielectric properties , in contrast to the previous proposal @xcite .",
    "general relativity can be put to practical use in electrical engineering , but electrical engineering may be also used for demonstrating some elusive effects of general relativity .    ]",
    "perfect invisibility devices @xcite , perfect lenses @xcite-@xcite , the optical aharonov - bohm effect @xcite and artificial event horizons @xcite-@xcite are all examples of one unifying concept : electromagnetic media that facilitate coordinate transformations . adopting ideas from general relativity @xcite-@xcite we developed a concise formalism for finding the properties of meta - materials that turn a desired function into fact .",
    "we extended the previously reported method @xcite to media that act as space - time transformations and that may exhibit negative refraction and signs of multi - valued physical space .",
    "the most interesting properties of such transformation media seem to stem from non - trivial topologies : spaces with holes in the case of invisibility devices , coordinate folds for negative refraction , multi - valued physical space for the aharonov - bohm effect and multiple sheets of electromagnetic space - time in the case of artificial event horizons .",
    "our theory can be extended in at least two directions .",
    "so far we assumed that electromagnetic space - time is empty , but one could easily incorporate media with non - trivial @xmath100 and @xmath101 here .",
    "we also assumed that the mapping between electromagnetic fields in real and fictitious space is exact . in practice",
    ", the accuracy of geometrical optics @xcite is often completely sufficient ; one could further generalize our method to include transformations that are only exact within the validity range of geometrical optics .",
    "optical conformal mapping @xcite is such an example .",
