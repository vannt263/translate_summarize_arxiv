    "this is a reasonable assumption for the and photoheating at @xmath8 due to the low opacity of the igm , but not for the photoheating as is in the process of being ionized by the percolation of spheres ( sah ) .",
    "these simulations therefore underestimate the temperature of the igm during the epoch of helium reionization .",
    "the standard approach taken in these simulations is to assume a homogeneous photoionizing background which evolves with redshift consistent with observed quasar and galaxy counts , such as that by haardt & madau ( 2001 ) .",
    "the ionization and thermal state of the baryonic gas is then computed self - consistently with its dynamics by solving the equations of hydrodynamic cosmology including radiative heating and cooling ( cen 1992 ; katz , weinberg & hernquist 1996 ; anninos et al .",
    "it is found that the temperature of the low density igm is determined almost entirely by photoheating balancing adiabatic cooling due to cosmic expansion .",
    "this results in a tight relationship between gas temperature and density , the so - called equation of state of the igm ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gas overdensity and @xmath11 is redshift dependent but in the range @xmath12 .",
    "abel & haehnelt ( 1999 ) show that opacity effects during reionization raises @xmath13 and reduces @xmath11 relative to an optically thin calculation .",
    "a technique often employed to include opacity effects within hydrodynamic simulations is to simply multiply the photoheating rate by a constant factor @xmath14 , with a value of 2 - 4 being sufficient to match observed temperatures ( e.g. , bryan & machacek 2000 ; jena et al .",

    "if the temperature of the igm alone determined the b - values , then it would be straightforward to measure the temperature from high resolution spectra .",
    "however , hubble broadening is always of the same order as the thermal broadening in absorption lines ( schaye 1999 ) , hence the need for comparison with simulations .",

    "bryan & machacek ( 2000 ) independently explored the same diagnostics and found that temperature estimates were sensitive to the assumed cosmology , in particular the amplitude of mass fluctuations on a few mpc scales .",

    "a proper calculation of reionization would treat quasars as point sources within the simulation volume and solve the equation of radiative transfer for the spatial distribution of the ionizing background coupled self - consistently to the dynamical , thermal , and ionization evolution of the gas .",
    "this was done in an approximate way by sah , who post - processed a series of density fields taken from a sph hydrodynamical simulation of the igm using the gadget code .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulation used the optically thin prescription for ionizing and heating the gas , assuming all ionization states of hydrogen and helium were in ionization equilibrium with the uvb of haardt & madau ( 1996 ) . in the post - processing step ,",

    "although we keep track of the late reheating , we do not modify the underlying density fields nor do we alter temperature - dependent recombination rates , which will affect the detailed ionization state of the gas . in  5 we present an analysis of our main result , which is the late reheating of the igm due to inhomogeneous reionization , as well as the importance of neglecting these coupling effects .",

    "we derive the rate equation for species fraction in an expanding universe ( appendix a ) , provide more detail on the affect of neglecting photoheating on the ionization state of the gas ( appendix b ) , and document the reaction rate coefficients we use ( appendix c ) .",
    "in this work , we present the results from post - processing the redshift evolution of a cosmic realization computed with the eulerian cosmological hydrodynamic code enzo ( bryan & norman 1997 ; norman & bryan 1999 ; oshea et al .",
    "the box of size 67@xmath24 mpc comoving was evolved in a flat ( @xmath25 ) @xmath26cdm cosmology on a unigrid mesh of @xmath27 grid cells and @xmath27 dark matter particles from z=99 to @xmath28 .",
    "we used the initial power spectrum of matter fluctuations by eisenstein & hu ( 1999 ) to initialize the calculation which was then computed forward under the zeldovich approximation ( bertschinger & gelb 1991 ) .",

    "we show a volumetric rendering of the cosmic gas distribution as mapped by the baryon overdensity in our simulation at z=2.6 .",
    "one of the fundamental simplifications used here , which places limits on the validity of our results is that the ionization of and are treated entirely differently than .",
    "the motivation is that of numerical simplicity and calculation speed . from the igm cosmological evolution standpoint , hydrogen and neutral helium",
    "are believed to be globally ionized at an earlier cosmic epoch than . in the simulation discussed here ,",
    "the photo ",
    "ionization / heating rates of and are computed self - consistently during the hydrodynamical calculation in the optically thin regime .",
    "the premise of our argument is that , if one adopts a picture where neutral hydrogen and neutral helium reionization is completed by @xmath36 , such species will have large ionization fractions by the time reionization occurs , which theoretical models and observations place at @xmath37 .",
    "the reionization of the /species is achieved by the evolving uniform metagalactic flux due to stellar sources as computed in haardt & madau ( 2001 ) .",
    "the uniform ultra - violet background photo - ionizes and photo - heats the igm , however it is prevented by hand to radiatively alter the abundance .",
    "we do so by suppressing the ionization / heating rates in enzo that control the @xmath38 chemistry .",
    "the latter is computed separately by our inhomogeneous point - source distribution of qsos which is discussed in  [ subqso ] .",
    "the initial calculation represents an undisturbed cosmological ensemble of gas fields ionized by a distributed galaxy population .",
    "the local qso component then acts as a perturbation in the amplitude of the radiative energy that further ionizes and photoheats the diffuse igm .",
    "the end result is that the reionization proceeds , under the limitations discussed above , via the mergers of individual i - fronts during the cosmic epoch that spans the redshift interval @xmath39 .      in this section",
    "we introduce some definitions and basic results related to reionization that we will refer to later on .",
    "the softness parameter of the cosmic radiation is defined as @xmath40 . in the optical thin limit under a single power law profile for the radiation spectrum , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the volume averaged mean intensity at the hydrogen ionization threshold",
    ", we can estimate the photoionization rates to be @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "dividing the last two relations yields an estimate for the softness parameter in the optical thin limit equal to @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the ability of a background radiation field to ionize the and species depends on the spectral slope",
    ". a soft radiation field would have large spectral slope and would primarily favor hydrogen ionization .",
    "ionization therefore requires a hard ionizing spectrum .",
    "the available sources of radiation at redshifts @xmath46 are of two types .",
    "stellar sources , associated with radiation from galaxies forming in the cosmic medium at such redshifts , have large softness parameter values of @xmath47 .",
    "qsos on the other hand , have much smaller softness parameter values of @xmath48 which makes them ideal for ionization .",
    "however , the number density of qsos , as measured by observations sharply rises in the interval @xmath49 and reaches a peak at about @xmath50 ( pei 1995 ) .",
    "the highest redshift qso observed to date is at @xmath51 ( hu , cowie & mcmahon 2002 ) .",
    "direct observations of qso in ly@xmath52 spectra are very difficult because of the hydrogen gunn - peterson effect , the optical depth manifestation of hydrogen neutrality at high redshifts ( fan , carilli & keating 2006 ) .",
    "this suggests that either the quasars have a well established population by @xmath53 but nevertheless obscured by the large optical depth or that their formation began at that epoch .",
    "however , when their emissivity is computed at redshifts just past the gunn - peterson trough , their numbers and spectrum shape is insufficient to produce the hydrogen reionization thought to be primarily achieved by a stellar component in the uvb which ionizes hydrogen and neutral helium to the singly ionized state . because the stellar component of the radiation background is not an efficient ionizer , reionization is expected to occur later ; at times when a sufficient number hard photons becomes available .",
    "the gunn - peterson optical depth of for a uniform igm can be expressed in the same way as the corresponding and that leads to the ratio @xmath54 .",
    "the ratio of optical depths is known as the r - factor and is used in observations to measure the relative properties between the and ly@xmath52 forest spectra .",
    "observations find that in transmission spectra longward of quasars seen at emission redshifts @xmath55 typically measure values of the r - factor between @xmath56 within @xmath57 ( reimers et al .",
    "1997 ; heap et al .",
    "2000 ; kriss et al .",
    "this suggests the presence of a heii gunn - peterson trough at redshifts @xmath58 . in the optical thin limit the r - factor and the softness parameter relation can be derived .    in ionization equilibrium",
    "the ratio of @xmath59 can be computed if we assume that the higher ionization states of both species ( , ) dominate . in that case , for hydrogen we get @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the recombination coefficient .",
    "similarly for we can also write @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the recombination coefficient .",
    "the above two relations yield @xmath66 , for @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the last equation allows for the determination of the ratio @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath70 ( at @xmath71 k ) the ratio of number densities becomes @xmath72 . from the last relation it follows that @xmath73 . for @xmath74 ( stellar radiation )",
    "the relation predicts @xmath75 .",
    "similarly for quasar radiation , with @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "in addition , we can compute that since the quantity @xmath78 , the ratio of the ionization to recombination time scales , @xmath79    typical softness parameter values @xmath80 then yield @xmath81 .",
    "the last relation shows that , due to the larger recombination coefficient and the fewer number of photons available for ionization , it is more difficult to ionize compared to .",
    "the shorter ( longer ) recombination ( ionization ) time scale effectively restricts reionization to take place at a slower rate .",
    "large values in the r - factor is suggestive of large optical depths in and/or small optical depths in neutral hydrogen .",
    "comparable optical depths at late redshifts , which correlate to small cosmic neutral hydrogen fraction and therefore small cosmic fraction in , yield small values for the r - factor .",
    "the observations can therefore infer a range in the observed softness parameter from measuring the ratio of optical depths in the and line forest .",
    "the observed range of r=10 - 100 consequently suggests that s=100 - 1000 between z=2 - 3 although the upper limit is an overestimate because we assumed @xmath82 .",
    "because such observed values are sampled in transmission spectra that probe the ionization phase transition of to , we can infer that at that epoch the galaxy dominated ultraviolet background is gradually being replaced by a quasar dominated type .    in  [ obs ]",
    ", we show that the r - factor evolves with redshift from large to small values as it is computed in transmission through the computational volume .",
    "the quantity that is actually computed is the @xmath83 parameter defined as the column density ratio between and , @xmath84 .",
    "the r - factor evolution and value follows directly as @xmath85 .",
    "the gradual evolution of the r - factor and @xmath83 parameter from large values is indicative of the cosmic evolution of the softness parameter from a stellar to a quasar dominated type .      for the quasar placement and evolution in the simulation",
    "we use the quasar luminosity function by pei et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , shown in equation  ( [ peieq ] ) .",
    "this luminosity function was also used by haardt & madau ( 1996,2001 ) to derive the quasar emissivity and the volume average photoionization and heating rates used in the simulation for every species other than .",

    "the redshift is for all practical purposes a matter of choice , since there is no accurate prediction of when the first qso appears in the universe .",
    "we adopt a scenario where quasars become visible in observations after the epoch of hydrogen reionization is completed by @xmath88 due a soft component in the ultra - violet background most likely associated with dwarf galaxy formation .",
    "in addition , we are constrained by the mass resolution of our simulation , which can not resolve halos smaller than @xmath89 @xmath35",
    ". therefore , quasar point sources have to be placed in the centers of halos above this cutoff .",
    "we do so by identifying the evolution of a list of halo centers through the computational volume from @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "the number of quasars per redshift interval is determined by the luminosity function in equation  ( [ peieq ] ) and the functional form of the mass - halo to quasar luminosity relation .",
    "we assume an intrinsic quasar spectrum @xmath92 for the lyc part of the spectrum with a spectral index @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , the number flux of emitted lyc photons , in @xmath94 , is then @xmath95 . in this relation , @xmath96",
    ". the integration yields @xmath97 .",
    "similarly the lyc energy flux is @xmath98 , which yields @xmath99 . in the last equation , @xmath100 and",
    "@xmath101 represent the total lyc luminosity ( ergs / s ) and emitted photon rate ( photons / s ) respectively per point source ( qso ) above the ionization threshold of 1 ryd ( 13.6 ev ) .",
    "this allows for a parametrization of the emitted ionizing flux based on the number of lyc photons rather than energy .",
    "the motivation is entirely for consistency with the photon - conserving schemes in simulating reionization ( abel & haehnelt 1999 ; sokasian , abel & haehnelt 2001 , 2002 ; ciardi et al .",
    "2003 ; whalen , abel & norman 2004 ) .",
    "the total luminosity for the ionizing radiation above 4 ryd ( 54.4 ev ) is then obtained through @xmath102 .",
    "the luminosity of each source is determined by the dark matter mass of the halo that initially creates it . for a dark matter halo of mass @xmath103",
    "we put in a uv source emitting @xmath104 ionizing photons / s .",
    "this is equivalent to placing a @xmath105 @xmath106 mini - quasar inside a @xmath107 @xmath35 dark matter halo which is the prescription used in abel & haenhelt ( 1999 ) .",
    "sokasian et al . (",
    "2001 ) investigated an array of qso placement methods in the computational volume and found that the results are largely insensitive to the choice .",
    "we adopt the linear relation for convenience . in this work",
    ", the most massive halo computed at at z=2.5 has mass @xmath108 @xmath35 .",
    "if a qso source is placed there then it will emit lyc photons at a rate of @xmath109 @xmath110 .",
    "for an input spectrum with slope @xmath93 the photon rate corresponds to a lyc luminosity of @xmath111 ergs / s and @xmath112 ergs / s for and respectively .",
    "the placement of the point sources in the volume is dynamical in nature .",
    "the list of dark matter halos is assigned a quasar source with a luminosity value determined by our phenomenological prescription .",
    "the location of the quasar from that point on is locked to the position of the dark matter particle closest to the center of the halo .",
    "the distribution of luminosities is then integrated from the higher value to the smallest up to the point where the average luminosity per unit volume reproduces the distribution fit given by equation  ( [ peieq ] ) at each redshift . for simplicity , we do not evolve the luminosity in each dark matter halo , which remains the same at initialization . as the luminosity function increases with decreasing redshift additional sources",
    "are spawned in the simulation , leading to an overall increase of their numbers . at @xmath113 the flattening and subsequent decrease in the luminosity function",
    "is modeled by randomly removing point sources from the quasar list . in the right panel of figure  ( [ ch5_volfig_nqso ] )",
    "we show the redshift evolution in the number of qso sources in the volume .",
    "the location each point source is used to compute the 3d distribution of the tensor eddington factor (  4.1 ) which is stored at each cosmic time step .",
    "the local value @xmath114 at @xmath115 is an interpolated value between the local values of the two data dumps whose redshifts bound the instantaneous time ( @xmath116 ) . as we will discuss in the next sections , the cosmic evolution of the helium reionization",
    "is decoupled from the corresponding hydrogen one .",
    "consequently , the placement of a ionizing source on a density peak with a precomputed hydrogen and therefore electron density can yield significant discrepancy between our calculation and a self - consistent one , particularly in close proximity to the source .",
    "as mentioned above , in the numerical and physical setup of this present work , we treat the ionization of and separately from . the metagalactic flux we use from haardt & madau ( 2001 )",
    "tabulates the contributions due to galaxies ( gal ) and quasars ( qso ) separately . in enzo",
    "we have the option of running a simulation with gal only , qso only , or gal+qso . in a standard optically thin simulation the gal+qso uvb would be used .",
    "we have carried out such a simulation , hereafter called simulation a , for comparison with the inhomogeneous reionization simulation .",
    "for the latter , we first run a hydro simulation using the gal uvb to ionize and",
    ". then reionization is accomplished by treating quasars as point sources as detailed in  4 .",
    "since our quasar population follows the same luminosity function and intrinsic spectrum as assumed by haardt & madau , we are able to compare the homogeneous and inhomogeneous simulations directly .",
    "we consider the effect of the @xmath117 ev photon field as a perturbation on the previously ionized gas which affects only the @xmath118 chemistry while the and ionization states remain unaffected .",
    "the treatment is by all measures an approximation that allows the problem to be solved as a single species ionization problem only and therefore it remains conceptually simple . in reality , the ionization of has two inter - dependent effects ; it releases additionally one electron per ionization which in turn , when thermalized , raises the mean temperature of the igm .",
    "these two effects combined would in principle shift the ionization balance of the /and /species .",
    "however , we show in this section that because by the time this takes place hydrogen and helium have already large ionization fractions the aforementioned effects are small .    starting with the rate equation for hydrogen and the cosmic mean density",
    ", we can safely ignore the collisional contributions and write the chemical balance in the proper frame of reference as follows :    @xmath119    in equation  ( [ hieqn ] ) , @xmath120 , @xmath121 is the integrated photoionization rate , and @xmath122 is the radiative recombination coefficient in the @xmath123 reaction and is a function of temperature . in a cosmic medium , @xmath124 , where @xmath125 for a mass of fraction of @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively . the number density can then be rewritten as @xmath128 which in turn allows the electron density to be expressed as follows :    @xmath129\\ ] ]    changing slightly the notation , we can rewrite equation  ( [ hieqn ] ) according to appendix  ( a ) in terms of the ionization fractions @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath64 and @xmath132 as :    @xmath133 \\rightarrow\\ ] ] @xmath134\\ ] ]    in the last equation , we assumed that almost all of the helium is highly ionized to the state @xmath135 . in ionization equilibrium ( @xmath136 ) , after setting @xmath137 we can rewrite equation  ( [ hieqn2 ] ) as @xmath138 . on one hand ,",
    "the ionization of the would increase quantity a due to the increase in the abundance . on the other hand ,",
    "the increased temperature would decrease the recombination coefficient which can be approximated as @xmath139 , for temperatures in the range of @xmath140 k and @xmath141 .",
    "the approximation is based on expression fits by bugress ( 1964 ) .",
    "therefore , we will investigate two extreme cases .",
    "case  ( i ) represents zero abundance , @xmath142 and would correspond to the unperturbed temperature @xmath143 .",
    "case  ( ii ) represents a limit of almost full ionization , @xmath144 , that would correspond to a new temperature @xmath145 . in both cases ,",
    "the hydrogen ionization rate is the same because our treatment of the individual qso sources placement has a distribution that is statistically identical to the global average used for and ionization .",
    "therefore , we can form the ratio :    @xmath146    equation  ( [ hieqn3 ] ) is solved in appendix  ( b ) , for @xmath147 in the range of @xmath148 and for @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 .",
    "the ratio of temperatures is based on estimates of the temperature increase due to the photoelectrons injected in the igm from the ionized atoms ( haehnelt & steinmetz 1998 ; abel & haehnelt 1999 ) and will be discussed in more detail in  [ he2tm ] .",
    "the results in the appendix figures show that when hydrogen is highly ionized then the shift in the ionization balance due to the ionization results in a decrease of the neutral hydrogen fraction primarily due to the decrease of the ionized hydrogen s recombination coefficient .",
    "the @xmath152% reduction depends on the temperature increase , where the largest increase ( a factor of 2 ) produces the biggest shift .",
    "the fractional decrease in the neutral hydrogen fraction is smallest at low fractions of ionized hydrogen . for a typical neutral hydrogen fraction of @xmath153 at post - reionization redshifts",
    ", we can then estimate that our treatment ( of not updating the hydrogen abundances ) would overestimate the neutral hydrogen fraction by about 25% if the gas temperature increase is between 1.5 - 2 times the non - perturbed value .",
    "consequently , we anticipate an overestimate by the same amount in the optical depth of hydrogen ly@xmath52 radiation and an underestimate in the mean transmitted flux . the problem is similar to the one described in zhang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , bryan et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and jena et al .",
    "an unmodified uvb by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) , applied in those simulations , would not yield an agreement with the observed b - parameter of the ly@xmath52 forest .",
    "an adjustment by a factor of 1.5 - 2.0  in the photoheating rate was then necessary to match the observed results .",
    "therefore , we caution against a strict interpretation of the resulting hydrogen ly@xmath52 forest in the original calculation in which we suppressed the photoionization and photoheating processes altogether .",
    "we compute the inhomogeneous reionization due to an evolving distribution of local qso - type sources by solving for the time and spatial evolution of the ionizing radiation energy density @xmath154 as shown in following section . in  [ chem ] we describe our simplified chemistry model , and in  [ chemresults ] we present results .",
    "we defer a discussion of late photoheating to  [ he2tm ] .",

    "the optical depth effects are demonstrated in the right panel of figure  ( [ tempevl ] ) , where we show ( z=2.5 ) the median temperature vs. density ( solid line ) in the scatter plot between the two quantities on the simulation grid .",
    "we obtain the curve by binning the gas overdensity in logarithmic intervals and computing the median gas temperature within each bin . for reference ,",
    "the relation in the original calculation is also shown ( dashed lines ) .",
    "on the left panel of figure  ( [ tempevl-2 ] ) , we plot the ratio between the optically thick optically thin calculations .",
    "the dashed lines shows the effect of our postprocessing on the gas temperature .",
    "photoionization contributes primarily to the gas temperature at the mean and low gas densities .",
    "the effect is diminished at higher overdensities where collisional ionization dominates .",
    "in addition to comparing to the original calculation we also compare to a simulation where the chemical species abundunces are self - consistently computed during the simulation due to the same homogeneous uv background and in the optically thin limit .",
    "the dot - dashed curves on the right panel of figure  ( [ tempevl ] ) and the left panel of figure  ( [ tempevl-2 ] ) trace the temperature density relation in that case and the ratio to our optically thick calculation respectively .",
    "we find that our postprocessed temperature is higher by a factor of @xmath346 at the cosmic density level when compared to the optically thin calculation with a homogeneous uv background .",
    "this is consistent with the analytical approximation between an optical thick and optical calculation derived in abel & haenhelt ( 1999 ) . finally",
    ", we plot on the right panel of figure  ( [ tempevl-2 ] ) the relation between the slope of the equation of state versus the gas overdensity for all three simulations .    in conclusion , the increase in temperature is a manifestation of the additional heating that results from photoelectrons ejected by ionizations in the redshift interval that corresponds to the rise in the number density of sources emitting hard radiation .",
    "the physical implication is that the late increase in temperature may well be the reason why the galaxy luminosity function decreases at @xmath263 .",
    "a raise in the mean temperature due to the cosmic evolution of qso sources would increase the jeans mass threshold by a factor of 2.2 - 5 if we adapt an average increase in the temperature between 1.7 - 3 ( @xmath347 ) .",
    "the latter would in turn suppress the further formation of dwarf galaxies in the cosmic volume .",
    "however , we find that , according to the right panel of figure  ( [ tempevl ] ) , the fractional increase in local gas temperature is on average not that large at higher overdensities . if we exclude cosmic neighborhoods that are in close proximity to the local uv sources , where the temperature increase is significantly greater due to the high radiative energy density , then in collapsed structures at @xmath348 which are increasingly self - shielding , photoheating is not as effective as shock heating due to gravitational collapse . nonetheless , a firm conclusion on that effect is not possible in this work , due to the very coarse grid resolution that does not adequately resolve the aforementioned structures .",
    "the updated density and gas temperature can be used to study the effects of this inhomogeneous reionization scheme on the transmission of the intergalactic medium transmission in the ly@xmath52 restframe wavelength .",
    "the objective is to compare with the transmissivity obtained from analyzing the currently available observed lines of sight .",
    "we synthesize spectra of the ly@xmath52 absorption at the rest wavelength of 304     along 300 random lines of sight ( los ) .",
    "the number of los was chosen in order to yield a less than 1% fluctuation to the mean transmitted flux by the end of the calculation .",
    "the synthesis method is described in detail in zhang et al .",
    "in addition to , we also compute the transmitted flux of the corresponding forest at the rest wavelength of ly@xmath52 1216   .",
    "each velocity pixel registers the local absorption in and and therefore maps onto the same grid location for the two redshifted wavelengths .",
    "the redshift interval of the spectrum output is set at @xmath349 .",
    "in addition to this interval being the redshift output interval of the hydrodynamic simulation it is a long redshift path that minimizes the sightline to sightline variance by forcing the transmission path to cross and wrap through the volume boundaries along the same directional vector about @xmath350 times .",
    "@xmath351 is the linear size of the cube in redshift units where @xmath352 is the hubble constant at redshift z and l=100 mpc comoving . at @xmath353 and for h=0.71",
    "the hubble constant is @xmath354 mpc / km / s which yields @xmath355 and @xmath356 , the number of wraps through the computational volume .",
    "the output from the hydrodynamic simulation is saved every @xmath357 and each optical depth integration is computed between two data dumps at @xmath358 and @xmath359 .",
    "the output spectrum is therefore centered at @xmath360 , where @xmath361 .",
    "the input fields are species density ( and ) , gas temperature and the three peculiar velocity components , all assumed to be frozen in the comoving frame of reference .",
    "however , we allow proper evolution along the redshift path of the sightline for the densities ( @xmath362 ) and velocities ( @xmath363 ) .",
    "the spectra are computed along lines of sight that sample the computational volume continuously for @xmath364 .",
    "we do this by restarting the calculation in the new redshift interval from the mesh location where the previous calculation stopped and continue along the same directional vector .",
    "the initial point of origin is randomly selected .",
    "after the completion of each @xmath2 segment we can paste all segments together to obtain a continuous transmission line of sight .",
    "the latter can then be resampled at intervals centered to suit our analysis .    at redshifts where",
    "absorption features can be recognized as blends of individual lines , a deblending algorithm , described in zhang et al .",
    "( 1997 ; 1998 ) based on fitting lorentzian profiles below a transmission cutoff , can identify such lines and compute properties such as the column density , broadening width ( b - parameter ) and equivalent width .",
    "we must note , that as the opacity of the igm increases with redshift and the transmission spectrum is dominated by dark regions , the algorithm fails in identifying the lines .",
    "typically , good results are obtained just past the reionization opacity tail which will be the focus in this analysis .    in figure  ( [ spclm ] )",
    "we show an example sightline of ( top left panel ) and ( bottom left panel ) ly@xmath52 transmission at z=2.5 and compare with the results from an enzo simulation that computes abundances self - consistently in the optical thin limit ( top and bottom right panels ) using a uvb from a mix of evolving quasar and galaxy populations ( haardt & madau 2001 ) .",
    "both transmission lines are casted from the same initial point and along the same directional vector .",
    "we use the updated temperature and the unperturbed neutral hydrogen abundance for calculating the transmission spectra .",
    "although there are few visible differences at first glance , the spectrum in the postprocessed temperature case has a continuum flux level below that of the optically thin , self - consistent case . since the mean transmitted flux is sensitive to the number of pixels close to the continuum at low redshifts the line of sight average transmitted flux in the post processed calculation is below the value obtained from the self consistent calculation by about @xmath365% . that was expected in our discussion in section  ( [ h1r ] ) .",
    "in the absorption spectra along the randomly casted sightlines there is an apparent lack of signatures marking the presence or not of the local ionizing sources .",
    "the spectra in the examples shown in figure  ( [ spclm ] ) look in general similar , although in some isolated regions the local amplitude clearly differs from a uniform uv background .",
    "this result is expected because at the time of reionization completion , the mean absorption in a random sightline spanning 2.4 times the length of the simulated cube is not sensitive to any local effects by the ionizing sources but rather depends on the value of the ionizing radiation at the level of the mean density and the density valleys .",
    "we show on the left panels of figure  ( [ 2nsfig1 ] ) a sightline with a path that takes the sightline about one mesh resolution element , @xmath366 mpc comoving , away from a uv source . on the top left panel",
    ", we show the ly@xmath52 transmission versus observed wavelength .",
    "below , we plot the instantaneous comoving distance of each velocity pixel to the closest uv source versus the comoving path length of the sightline .",
    "the last curve is a joint ensample of parabolic curves each having a minimum , marked with crosses , that corresponds to the position of nearest distance to the ionizing source .",
    "each time another uv source becomes closest to the trajectory , the curve is marked by the beginning of an another parabola .",
    "we note that at the location of closest proximity for that sightline , at @xmath367 mpc comoving along the path , the corresponding transmission is almost 1 .",
    "since the sources are placed at the high density dark matter peaks , which they subsequently follow during the dynamical evolution of the dark matter distribution , the absorption at that location is due to the uv source proximity .",
    "however , at a part of the spectrum about 1042   , the high transmission there is due to a highly ionized underdense region since the closest point source is more that 20 mpc comoving away .",
    "therefore , from the information in the spectra alone , we will not be able to distinguish between transmission in a region close an ionizing source or transmission from an underdense region .",
    "we will call impact parameter each nearest distance to an ionizing source encountered by the sightline trajectory . on the right panel of figure  ( [ 2nsfig1 ] ) , we plot the sightline distribution of impact parameters in bins of constant size 1 mpc . the upper horizontal axis converts comoving mpc distances to proper separation velocities .",
    "the distribution is negatively skewed with a peak frequency ( mode ) located at @xmath368 mpc ( @xmath369 km / s ) . due to negative skewness , the mean",
    "is shifted to the right at a value of @xmath370 mpc ( @xmath371 km / s ) .",
    "the negative skewness is most likely due to the fact that the distribution of the uv point sources on the grid is not isotropic but are clustered according to the clustering properties of the host dark matter halos . from the distribution in the right panel of figure  ( [ 2nsfig1 ] )",
    "we can compute a typical range of impact parameters in the sightlines of @xmath372 mpc comoving contained within the values of the distribution at 1/e the peak value .",
    "we are interested to determine whether the transmission properties of our sightline sample is in any way biased by the proximity to the ionizing sources or if we are mostly sensitive to the values of the ionizing flux at the mean level .",
    "detailed analysis of the proximity effect around each source is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we can impose an upper bound limit based on the highest luminosity quasar in the computational volume at z=2.5 , @xmath373 ergs / s where @xmath374 designates continuum ionizing luminosity above 4 ryd .",
    "an estimate of a proximity size distance can be obtained from the volume averaged energy density above the ionization threshold , @xmath375 . in our calculation",
    "we have computed @xmath376 ergs/@xmath377 which corresponds to a volume averaged ionizing flux equal to @xmath378 ergs / s/@xmath379 .",
    "the condition that the geometrical attenuation of the central emission equals the total flux through the surface of a sphere centered at the source yields an upper bound for this proximity distance of @xmath380 mpc proper or @xmath381 mpc comoving .",
    "when compared to the comoving length of the sightlines ( @xmath382 mpc comoving ) we expect that these regions do not have a large effect on the mean ly@xmath52 transmission value .    on the left panel of figure  ( [ 2nsfig2 ] ) , we show a quantitative estimate of that effect .",
    "there , we scatter plot the average impact parameter of the sightline versus the mean transmission in each sightline ( cross symbols ) .",
    "the degree of their linear correlation , measured by the pearson correlation coefficient , is rather small , @xmath383 .",
    "the figure does show that there is non - negligible negative correlation between mean transmission and the average proximity to the distribution of ionizing sources for each sightline .",
    "a power law fit to the data in the form @xmath384 where @xmath385 is the sightline specific mean flux and @xmath386 is the average impact parameter yields @xmath387 and is plotted over the individual points .",
    "the curve lies within the two standard deviations levels of the mean transmission .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the proximity effects have no statistical weight on the sightline transmissions .",
    "that is consistent with our estimate of the upper limit on the proximity distance ( @xmath388 mpc comoving ) based on matching the attenuation of the point luminosity to the volume averaged ionizing flux .",
    "since the typical range of the impact parameters is between 2 - 22 mpc comoving our sightlines are on average too far away from the point sources .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the right panel of figure  ( [ 2nsfig2 ] ) where we show the scatter plot between the individual impact parameter values and the local ly@xmath52 absorbed flux at that distance from the point source ( points ) .",
    "the data show a tail of low absorption at small impact parameters at distances @xmath389 mpc comoving .",
    "the distribution of absorption above @xmath390 mpc is consistent with the mean level of absorption in the sightline sample , shown as a horizontal blue solid line along with upper and lower blue dashed lines corresponding to the @xmath391 level . to get a clear view of the trend we bin the horizontal axis into constant logarithmic bins and compute the median ( red histogram ) and mean ( blue histogram ) per bin . a fermi - dirac function in the form @xmath392",
    "is then fitted to the median histogram with @xmath393 mpc ( point of half maximum ) and @xmath394 mpc ( skin width ) for impact parameters up to 10 mpc .",
    "the point of half maximum is consistent with the previous estimate of the proximity effect distance based on the luminosity and mean intensity of the uv field .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the effect of source proximity on the local absorbed flux are relevant at comoving distances of @xmath395 mpc where the local absorption matches the mean ly@xmath52 absorption in the igm and becomes significant at impact parameters @xmath389 mpc comoving where the local absorption matches the lower @xmath391 level of the mean absorption .      the straightforward average of the flux , @xmath396 , from all pixels and lines of sight per redshift interval , is a measure of the opacity of the cosmic volume due to the absorption by the particular chemical species ( and in this case ) . in",
    "the notation followed , @xmath397 is the number of pixels per redshift interval , which yields a redshift pixel resolution of @xmath398 , and @xmath399 is the number of random lines of sight .",
    "the redshift resolution is fixed in our calculation , which results in a redshift dependent spectral resolution of @xmath400 . at @xmath401",
    "this yields a spectral resolution of 50 times higher than the designed value of the spectrograph aboard fuse .",
    "the evolution of the mean transmitted flux is typically represented by the effective optical depth , defined as @xmath402 .",
    "as discussed in paschos & norman ( 2005 ) ( pn ) , the effective optical depth is biased by high transmission gaps in the pixel flux distribution and therefore will systematically yield lower values when compared to the mean optical depth .",
    "the latter is defined as the raw average of the pixel optical depth per redshift interval , @xmath403 , where @xmath404 is the pixel optical depth at redshift @xmath405 in the line of sight index @xmath406 . in figure  ( [ taus ] )",
    ", we show the redshift evolution of the the optical depth of the 304     line using both representations , mean ( left panel ) and effective ( right panel ) , which suggests a rather smooth evolution leading to reionization at @xmath269 .",
    "error bars show the 1@xmath407 standard deviation of the mean flux and optical depth values between different lines of sight . in the effective optical depth case , standard deviation at more than 100@xmath408 the mean flux value at @xmath409 yield negative lower bound values .",
    "a cutoff in the mean flux of @xmath410 was therefore imposed in order to be able to compute the natural logarithm .",
    "the error bars also indicate a large degree of variance in the data at redshifts @xmath411 consistent with pn which discussed properties of transmission during hydrogen reionization . there ,",
    "the large degree of variance during reionization was attributed to the presence of high transmission gaps associated with underdense regions in the igm which ionize first . in this picture of inhomogeneous reionization ,",
    "the high transmission segments at high redshifts are associated with bubbles that the lines of sight intersect as they are cast through the simulation box . however",
    ", this is not inconsistent with the conclusions reached in pn because the bubbles primarily extend in underdense to mean density cosmic regions .",

    "if reionization is completed by @xmath425 , as suggested by the observed lines of sight , that would correspond to an optical depth of @xmath426 .",
    "our calculation is about 1.5@xmath407 above that value at that redshift .",

    "the temperature is lower and therefore recombinations to the ground state may contribute a significant amount of ionizing radiation .",
    "nonetheless , due to the lack of a self - consistent calculation we do not know how large that effect would be on the slope of the optical depth redshift evolution .",
    "we do anticipate that the effect diminishes with redshift due to photoheating which raises the igm temperature .    from the right panel of figure  ( [ taus ] )",
    "we can infer a general agreement between the observed and computed values at redshifts that evidently sample the tail of the reionization epoch .",

    "the increase in temperature by a factor @xmath455 is consistent with a shift in the peak of the b - parameter distribution .",
    "note however , that the distributions at broadening widths larger than 50 km / s are indistinguishable which may be due to collisional ionization dominating the line opacity .",
    "since the forests are unresolved on the simulation grid , we make no claim on whether the computed b - parameter values have any relevance to the real universe .",
    "we can however compare the median values of the two species .",

    "the heavier by a factor of 4 helium atoms would yield a width only half the corresponding size of the hydrogen line , @xmath457 .",
    "our calculation suggests that the broadening due to the hubble differential flow and peculiar velocities dominate the line formation in the forest . that in turn would indicate that the lines primarily form in underdense and cosmic mean density regions .",

    "however , we came close enough to the observed values at redshifts later than the transmission trough , to reinforce our conclusion that our limited calculation is able to reproduce the much of the observed signatures of reionization .",

    "this distinguishes our calculation from the work of sokasian , abel and hernquist ( 2002 ) who simulated inhomogeneous reionization but did not study the thermal evolution of the gas .",
    "we find that the cosmic evolution of the qso population causes the individual regions to overlap and subsequently ionize 90 % of the volume at ionization fractions @xmath465 by @xmath466 .",
    "in addition , to the and number density calculation , we also update the local gas temperature due to the thermalization of the photoelectrons ejected by the heii ionization process . as expected , the temperature is higher compared to the unprocessed simulation with the difference increasing rapidly at redshifts @xmath113 .",
    "relative to a self - consistent optically thin simulation where is also photoionized by a homogeneous uv background , we find that optical depth effects result in an increase in the temperature of the intergalactic medium at the cosmic mean density level by a factor of @xmath467 at @xmath353 . the results of our temperature calculation are consistent with analytic and numerical predictions of the heii heating effect ( abel & haehnelt 1999 ; schaye et al .",

    "the analysis of the mean transmission allows for the derivation of the effective optical depth of the 304     line .",
    "we have calculated that at @xmath3 , the average of pixel flux among all lines of sight yields a value for the mean transmission of @xmath4 which corresponds to @xmath468 .",
    "the length of each sightline ( @xmath349 ) is longer than the size of the simulation in order to minimize the transmission variance across the redshift path .",
    "we compute the error only due to the sightline to sightline variance and find that at z=2.5 the 1@xmath407 standard deviation is @xmath469 the mean  flux .",
    "when we compare to estimates from forest spectra observed with the fuse ( far ultraviolet space explorer ) satellite and hst at the same redshift interval we find that the our value of the effective depth is comparable but slightly above the observed values .",
    "we attribute the disagreement to our approximate treatment of the inhomogeneous ionizing radiation that ignores the diffuse component and only focuses on the point sources input .",
    "in addition to the mean transmission estimate , we also compute the column density and b - parameter distribution of the identified ly@xmath52 lines and compare them to the corresponding statistical properties of the hi ly@xmath52 lines .",
    "we find that an optically thick calculation results in extra heating that shifts the b - parameter distributions to higher broadening widths .",
    "in addition and within the limitations of our coarse numerical resolution , which does not resolve the forest , our calculation shows that the median b - parameter at @xmath417 is @xmath470 the hi broadening width .",

    "for a single species medium and in proper coordinates the rate equation that governs the abundance of ionization state i is given by the following equation :    @xmath471    in equation  ( [ eqrates1 ] ) , @xmath472 denotes the number density of ionization states of the species in ionization or recombination coupling to state i. the ratio @xmath473 is a function of redshift and is equal to the redshift value of the hubble constant .    dividing by the total number density of the species , @xmath474",

    "in this calculation , we estimate the neutral hydrogen fraction if an additional source of ionization and heating is introduced due to the full photoionization of by a local uv radiation followed and the ejection of an additional electron per helium atom , assumed to be already singly ionized . the unmodified neutral fraction is labeled as case  ( i ) .",
    "case  ( ii ) represents the updated hydrogen abundance .    in figure",

    "the open squares ( circles ) represent the smallest ( largest ) temperature increase .",
    "the solid line stands for no difference between the two cases ( slope of 1 ) .",
    "the calculation shows that the largest temperature increase results in a greater departure from the straight line , although the degree of such departure becomes smaller at larger neutral fractions .",
    "this is shown on the right panel of figure  ( [ chi12 ] ) where we plot the percentage change in the hydrogen neutral fraction .",
    "we see a fixed degree of change between @xmath480 and a rapid decrease at @xmath481 . for the range of temperature increase used in the calculation we can then determine that a total photoionization would lead to an adjustment of the hydrogen neutral fraction by 12 - 24% .",
    "this corresponds to an overestimate of @xmath482 , in the absence of photoheating , by @xmath483% .",
    "the degree at which any temperature change affects the hydrogen ionization balance is sensitive to the functional form of the recombination coefficient . in general",
    ", the coefficient steepens at temperatures above @xmath484 k where the slope becomes a function of temperature itself .",
    "the results shown in figure  ( [ chi12 ] ) are derived with a constant slope of @xmath485 which is roughly valid at @xmath484 k. to explore the effects of the slope on the adjustment of the hydrogen neutral fraction , due to photoheating , we show on the left panel of figure  ( [ devtemp ] ) , the results of the calculation for an input neutral fraction of @xmath486 , @xmath487 and for a range of temperature ratios ( 0.5 - 2.0 ) .    the upper dashed line at @xmath488 represents the largest @xmath11 value ( 0.6 ) and indicates that a steepening of the temperature exponent leads to an increase in the neutral hydrogen fraction adjustment .",
    "this trend is reversed at @xmath489 ( cooling ) .",
    "the latter temperature adjustment range is not related to any photoheating effects but it was a numerical investigation of the solution .",
    "however , one can make the argument , depending on whether the uvb drops after a certain redshift , that additional cooling terms , such as collisional ionization cooling ( @xmath490 ) and recombination radiation cooling ( @xmath491 ) , might lower the temperature below the unperturbed value .",
    "however , such possibility is small at least up to @xmath28 .",
    "we also note from the left panel of figure  ( [ devtemp ] ) that not all values of a temperature increase lead to a positive neutral hydrogen fraction adjustment ( @xmath492 ) . in the @xmath485 case ( solid curve ) a small increase of the temperature by less than 15adjusted to a larger value and therefore @xmath493 .",
    "this a result of the increased electron number density due to the additional photoelectron ejected from the atom . in this narrow range of",
    "temperature increase the greater electron number density dominates the recombination rate , which consequently increases to shift the ionization balance towards more neutral hydrogen .",
    "this effect depends on the initial neutral fraction , as shown on the right panel of figure  ( [ devtemp ] ) .",
    "there , we plot the family of solutions of equation  ( [ hieqn3 ] ) ( @xmath485 ) for the range of neutral fractions ( @xmath494 ) and temperature adjustment factors ( @xmath495 ) .",
    "the solid line represents the solution obtained for @xmath486 from the left panel .",
    "the plot shows that as the neutral fraction increases the adjustment decreases for @xmath488 . as discussed in the previous paragraph , the range of @xmath496 where the electron density dominates the recombination rate shifts to the right towards lower ionization fractions .",
