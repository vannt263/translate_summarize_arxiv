    "in this paper we are concerned with the problem of boundary stabilization for a @xmath0 system of first - order hyperbolic _ quasilinear _ pdes , with actuation at only one of the boundaries .",
    "the quasilinear case is of interest since many relevant physical systems are described by @xmath0 systems of first - order hyperbolic quasilinear pdes , such as open channels  @xcite , transmission lines  @xcite , gas flow pipelines  @xcite or road traffic models  @xcite .",
    "this problem has been considered in the past for @xmath0 systems  @xcite and even @xmath3 systems  @xcite , using the explicit evolution of the riemann invariants along the characteristics .",
    "more recently , an approach using control lyapunov functions has been developed , for @xmath0 systems  @xcite and @xmath3 systems  @xcite .",
    "these results use only static output feedback ( the output being the value of the state on the boundaries ) .",
    "however , they do not deal with the same class of systems considered in this work ( which includes an extra term in the equations ) ; with this term , it has been shown in  @xcite that there are examples ( even for linear @xmath0 system ) for which there are no control lyapunov functions of the `` diagonal '' form @xmath4 ( see next section for notation ) which would allow the computation of a static output feedback law to stabilize the system , even if feedback is allowed on both sides of the boundary .",
    "several other authors have also studied this problem .",
    "for instance , the linear case has been analyzed in  @xcite ( using a lyapunov approach ) and in  @xcite ( using a spectral approach ) .",
    "the nonlinear case has been considered by  @xcite and  @xcite using a lyapunov approach , and in  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite using a riemann invariants approach .",
    "the basis of our design is the backstepping method  @xcite ; initially developed for parabolic equations , it has been used for first - order hyperbolic equations  @xcite , delay systems  @xcite , second - order hyperbolic equations  @xcite , fluid flows  @xcite , nonlinear pdes  @xcite and even pde adaptive designs  @xcite .",
    "the method allows us to design a full - state feedback law ( with actuation on only one end of the domain ) making the closed - loop system locally exponentially stable in the @xmath1 sense .",
    "the gains of the feedback law are the solution of a 4 x 4 system of first - order hyperbolic linear pdes , whose well - posedness is shown .",
    "the proof of stability is based on  @xcite ; we construct a strict lyapunov function , locally equivalent to the @xmath1 norm , and written in coordinates defined by the ( invertible ) backstepping transformation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sect - prob ]",
    "we formulate the problem . in section  [ sect - linear ]",
    "we consider the linear case and formulate a backstepping design that globally stabilizes the system in the @xmath5 sense . in section  [ sect - main ] we present our main result , which shows that the linear design locally stabilizes the nonlinear system in the @xmath1 sense .",

    "one finds the remaining values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and thus the solution of the system , as follows : @xmath94 thus , after @xmath60 , where @xmath95 one has that @xmath96 .      to map the original system ( [ eqn - wlinear ] ) into the target system ( [ eqn - gammalinear ] ) , we use the following transformation :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is a matrix of kernels . defining @xmath99",

    "since the transformation ( [ eqn - tran ] ) is invertible , when applying control law ( [ eqn - linearcontrol ] ) the dynamical behavior of ( [ eqn - wlinear ] ) is the same as the behavior of ( [ eqn - gammalinear ] ) , which is well - posed from standard results and whose explicit solution and stability properties we know from proposition  [ pr - target ] .",
    "thus , we obtain the explicit solutions of @xmath45 from the direct and inverse transformation , as follows : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the explicit solution of the @xmath122 , @xmath123 system , given by ( [ eqn - expalpha])([eqn - expbeta ] ) , with initial conditions : @xmath124 in particular , we know that @xmath51 goes to zero in finite time @xmath60 , therefore @xmath45 also shares that property . finally , since the origin of the @xmath51 system is @xmath5 exponentially stable with an arbitrary large exponential decay rate , we conclude , using the inverse transformation , that the origin of the @xmath45 system is also @xmath5 exponentially stable with an arbitrary large exponential decay rate . equation ( [ eqn - l2normth ] ) follows by using the inverse and direct transformations to relate the @xmath5 norms of @xmath45 and @xmath51 ( using the fact that the kernels of the transformations are continuous , and thus bounded , functions ) .      if the coefficient @xmath48 is zero in ( [ eqn - bculinear ] )",
    ", the method presented in the paper is not valid since ( [ eqn - bc1 ] ) would require the value of one of the control kernels to be infinity at the boundary of the domain @xmath125 .",
    "similarly , if the coefficient is close to zero one still gets very large values for the kernels close to the boundary , resulting in potentially large control laws .    the method can be modified to accommodate zero or small values of @xmath48 by setting a slightly different target system ( [ eqn - alpha])([eqn - beta ] ) , as follows : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is to be obtained from the method ; regardless of the value of @xmath127 , this is a cascade system which is still @xmath5 exponentially stable and converges in finite time by the same arguments of proposition  [ pr - target ] , since now , using the same lyapunov function @xmath68 defined in ( [ eqn - lyaplinear ] ) , we obtain @xmath69_0 ^ 1 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + 2 \\beta(0,t ) \\int_0",

    "the kernel equations resulting from the transformation are still the same ( [ eqn - kuu])([eqn - kvv ] ) , with the same boundary conditions ( [ eqn - bc2])([eqn - bc4 ] ) for @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 ( which reduces to @xmath128 when @xmath49 ) , but one obtains an _ undetermined _ boundary conditions for @xmath106 : @xmath129 where @xmath130 can be chosen as desired ; by choosing at least a continuous function , one can apply theorem  [ th - wp ] and thus the kernel equations are well - posed .",
    "after @xmath130 has been chosen and the kernels have been computed , one obtains the value of @xmath127 as @xmath131    invertibility of the transformation follows as before , thus one obtains the same result of theorem  [ th - control ] . the non - uniqueness in ( [ eqn - bc1q0 ] ) gives the designer some freedom in shaping the input function @xmath127 from @xmath123 to @xmath122 . also note",
    "that this has no impact in the feedback law as the kernels @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( which are the ones appearing in ( [ eqn - linearcontrol ] ) ) are uniquely defined and independent of the non - unique @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "we wish to show that the linear controller ( [ eqn - linearcontrol ] ) designed using backstepping works _ locally _ for the nonlinear system , in terms that will be made precise .    for that , we write our quasilinear system ( [ eqn - z ] ) in a form equivalent ( up to linear terms ) to ( [ eqn - wlinear ] ) . define @xmath132 we obtain a new state variable @xmath45 from @xmath12 using the following transformation : @xmath133=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\varphi_1(x ) & 0\\\\ 0 & \\varphi_2(x ) \\end{array }   \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } z_1(x , t)\\\\ z_2(x , t ) \\end{array }   \\right]=\\phi(x ) z(x , t),\\label{eqn - zw}\\ ] ] so that @xmath134 w(x , t)=\\phi^{-1}(x ) w(x , t).\\ ] ] it follows that @xmath45 verifies the following equation : @xmath135 where @xmath136   w.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is evident that @xmath137 and that @xmath138 .",

    "we will consider the case @xmath147 ; the case @xmath49 is analogous ( see remark  [ rem - qzero ] ) .",
    "notice that the linear parts of ( [ eqn - w2 ] ) and ( [ eqn - bcu2 ] ) are identical to ( [ eqn - wlinear ] ) and ( [ eqn - bculinear ] ) , and that the coefficients @xmath148 and @xmath70 verify the assumptions of section  [ sect - linear ] . also , it is clear that the nonlinear terms verify @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151    therefore , we consider using the feedback law : @xmath152 which implies , in terms of the original @xmath12 variable : @xmath153 where the kernels are computed from ( [ eqn - kuu])([eqn - bc4 ] ) using the coefficients @xmath148 and @xmath70 from ( [ eqn - nonlinearc ] ) and ( [ eqn - nonlinearsigma ] ) .",

    "these are @xmath156 while ( [ eqn - cc1 ] ) and ( [ eqn - cc3 ] ) are natural compatibility conditions , the conditions ( [ eqn - cc2 ] ) and ( [ eqn - cc4 ] ) are artificial ( since they show up due to the feedback law that has been designed ) and rather stringent , as they require very specific values of the initial conditions .",
    "thus , we modify our control law in a way that , without losing its stabilizing character , does not require any specific values in the initial values beyond the natural conditions ( [ eqn - cc1 ] ) and ( [ eqn - cc3 ] ) .",
    "the modification in the boundary conditions consists in adding a dynamic extension to the controller as follows : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is one of the states of the following system : @xmath159 where the constants @xmath160 and @xmath161 can be chosen as desired with the only conditions that @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
