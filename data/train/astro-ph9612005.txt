    "to study disk stability , we use the structural properties of the lsb disk galaxy ugc 128 and the hsb galaxy ngc 2403 , derived by de blok & mcgaugh @xcite from hi rotation curve decompositions .",
    "ugc 128 has a disk mass density nearly an order of magnitude below that of ngc 2403 , and is more dark matter dominated : the mass - to - light ratio within 6 scale lengths is @xmath0 for ugc 128 and @xmath1 for ngc 2403 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the rotation curves for ugc 128 and ngc 2403 are shown in figure 1a .",
    "one measure of the susceptibility of galactic disks to global bar instabilities is the @xmath2 parameter@xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath5 is the radius , and @xmath6 is the disk surface density . for flat rotation curves ,",
    "disks prove stable against growing modes if @xmath7 , while for linearly rising rotation curves @xmath8 is a sufficient condition for stability .",
    "figure 1b shows @xmath2 as a function of scale length for our representative galaxies .",
    "the hsb galaxy ngc 2403 is only marginally stable over a large range of radius , while the lsb galaxy ugc 128 proves stable throughout the disk , due to its lower mass surface density .",
    "we point out that the rotation curve modeling assumed maximum disk models ; if lsbs are less than maximal disks , they will be even _ more _ stable .    if lsb disks are stable against the growth of global instabilities in the disks , are they also stable against _ local _ instabilities ?",
    "the growth of local axisymmetric instabilities is measured by the toomre @xmath9 parameter @xcite : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the radial velocity dispersion of the disk stars .",
    "lacking information on @xmath11 in lsb disks , we use two alternatives : 1 ) that @xmath11 is like that in the milky way ( @xmath12 30 km s@xmath13 ) or 2 ) that @xmath14 ( so that @xmath15 11 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "figure 1c shows q in each disk ; if velocity dispersion drops with surface density as might be expected from energy arguments , lsb and hsb disks may have similar _ local _ stability properties , such that local instabilities might grow in lsb disks where global modes can not .",
    "to examine how lsb disks will respond to a close interaction , we simulate a grazing encounter between an lsb galaxy and an hsb companion . we choose a prograde , parabolic orbit with a perigalactic separation of @xmath16 disk scale lengths .    rather than build galaxy models which differ in a number of structural parameters , we focus on variations in disk surface density to define the difference between hsb and lsb disk galaxies .",
    "we construct two model galaxies with disk surface densities which differ by a factor of eight , similar to the difference between ngc 2403 and ugc 128 .",
    "the dark halos have identical mass distributions ( as a function of @xmath17 ) in both galaxies , resulting in our lsb being very dark matter dominated .",
    "we initialize velocities in _ both _ galaxy disks such that q=1.5 , implying lower velocity dispersion in the lsb disk ; the simulation is thus a conservative test of lsb stability . in models which include gas ,",
    "the gas comprises 10% of the total disk mass in each galaxy .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the hsb and lsb disks in the stellar dynamical interaction model .",
    "both galaxies respond strongly during the close passage ( at t=24 ) . in the hsb disk , the self - gravity of the disk",
    "amplifies the perturbation such that by t=44 the galaxy has developed a very strong bar .",
    "by contrast , the lsb disk displays a persistent oval distortion and long - lived spiral arms in the disk . without adequate disk self - gravity no strong bar develops in the lsb disk .",
    "figure 3a shows the strength of the @xmath18 mode in the inner half mass of each disk . the peak strength is more than twice that of the lsb disk , and declines at late time , probably due to disk heating by the bar .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath18 mode is not only different in strength between the disks , but also in character : the hsb sports a strong bar , while the lsb displays a milder oval distortion .",
    "the bar in the hsb galaxy drives strong inflow ( figure 3b ) : the gas surface density in the center of the hsb disk has risen significantly by t=36 . by contrast , the relatively weak response of the lsb disk results in very little change in the gas mass distribution in the disk , even much later after the encounter at t=72 ( figure 3c ) .",
    "both analytic arguments and numerical simulation indicate that , despite their seemingly fragile nature , lsb disks are quite stable , and resistant against the growth of bars and bar - driven inflows .",
    "these results present a problem for the otherwise appealing notion that interacting lsb dwarfs are the progenitors of hii galaxies experiencing central starbursts @xcite .",
    "even the relatively close , strong interaction we have presented will not result in a strong central starburst , nor will it drive strong structural evolution in the galaxy ; in order to provoke a violent enough response in the lsb disk , a bona - fide merger may be necessary .",

    "<S> the lack of companions around low surface brightness ( lsb ) disk galaxies @xcite has led to the suggestion that , without the well - established dynamical trigger provided by interactions , lsb galaxies may simply evolve passively due to their low surface densities @xcite , and never experience any strong star - forming era in their lifetimes . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , sufficient tidally induced star formation in lsb disks may drive evolution from lsb to high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies . this has been suggested as the cause of the observed isolation of lsb galaxies : interactions in denser environments transform them into hsb or hii galaxies or perhaps even destroy them entirely .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the ability for interactions to trigger evolution and starburst activity is linked to instabilities in the stellar disk . </S>",
    "<S> as lsb disk galaxies have lower disk mass densities and a greater fraction of dark to visible matter than do hsb galaxies@xcite , the stability of lsb disks  and their response to tidal interactions  may be quite different than that of `` normal '' hsb galaxies . in this study </S>",
