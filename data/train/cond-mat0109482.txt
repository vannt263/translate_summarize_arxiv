    "dynamical simulations of large systems of spins or particles should in principle lead to the same information as statistical simulations generating a canonical ensemble .",
    "although the energy is conserved one can determine the temperature for a system consisting of kinetic and potential energy the temperature by the average kinetic energy .",
    "with the recent advance in the understanding of the micro  canonical temperature initiated by rugh@xcite , one can `` measure '' the temperature and also the specific heat along the trajectory of spin systems where such a decomposition of the energy does not exist . in the case of @xmath0spins",
    "one could also add the sum over the angular velocities but a dynamical check of statistical mechanics by a common molecular dynamics simulation is not an easy numerical task@xcite .",
    "we think by using spin systems alone one has more efficient means to pursue this program .",
    "several attempts have been made to establish a strictly micro ",
    "canonical approach to study phase transitions @xcite .",
    "here we want to present a study of the planar or @xmath0spin systems , making use of a micro  canonical temperature definition discussed recently @xcite and the `` over  relaxation algorithm '' @xcite .",
    "this algorithm has been used to accelerate monte carlo simulations for heisenberg or @xmath1 spins for example . since it conserves energy it can be taken as a metropolis step , where steps leading to equal or lower energy are always accepted .",
    "the metropolis procedure leads to thermalisation , whereas the over  relaxation algorithm generates different configurations and thereby improves the convergence .",
    "the question we want to address is , can one work alone with the over  relaxation algorithm .",
    "since the temperature can be calculated as an average the metropolis procedure is not needed for the temperature determination .",
    "however , it is not guaranteed whether in a fixed energy simulation one `` visits '' enough regions of phase space in order to determine the physical observables reliably .",
    "more specifically we want to ask : is the finite size analysis the same as for canonical simulations ? a closely connected question : is the analysis of a first order transition really different from the standard one using a histogram@xcite analysis ?",
    "for numerical tests we have chosen @xmath0spins on a chain and on three dimensional simple cubic ( sc ) and face centered cubic ( fcc ) lattices both with nearest neighbour coupling",
    ". a second order transition on the sc lattice and the first order one on fcc@xcite will thus be studied .",
    "instead of three components for the classical heisenberg system in our preliminary paper@xcite , here we want to study the simpler @xmath1spin system where only two components @xmath2 have to be taken into account , that is the spin vector is confined to a circle with radius @xmath3 .",
    "no dynamical equation can be written down similar to @xmath4 for the three dimensional vector @xmath5 in a magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "the energy @xmath7 is the same for the two directions @xmath8 the vector @xmath5 can point .",
    "contrary to the three dimensional case , there is no continuous path between these equal energy states at @xmath9 .",
    "still we can calculate the size of the phase space @xmath10 summing over all contributions with the same energy @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath10 corresponds to the density of states in the classical limit .",
    "with the entropy @xmath3 as a function of energy given by @xmath12 ( boltzmann s constant set to unity ) , the density of states contains all information necessary for a thermodynamic analysis .",
    "we want to show that the derivative of @xmath3 with respect to the energy is easily accessible .    with @xmath13 spins of length @xmath14 , that is @xmath15",
    "one has @xmath16 where the integration is over @xmath13 unit circles .",
    "however , the integral is restricted to @xmath17 dimensions by @xmath18 .",
    "this restriction taken into account , one arrives at the second form of the integral with the gradient taken with respect to all @xmath19 angles@xcite . because the direction of the infinitesimal surface elements @xmath20 normal to the surface of constant energy coincides with the direction of the gradient @xmath21 , one arrives at a second form of the constant energy integral @xmath22 applying gauss theorem",
    "this integral can be written as an integral over all phase space with energy lower than @xmath11 , the restriction given by the heavyside step function @xmath23 .",
    "the quantity to be integrated is the divergence of a vector field @xmath24 with the property that the scalar product of @xmath21 and @xmath25 is unity @xcite .",
    "the derivative is then @xmath26 a constant energy integral like ( [ 2.1 ] ) for @xmath10 .",
    "the ratio of these two integrals gives then the inverse temperature @xmath27 since @xmath28 with the entropy @xmath3 given by ( [ 2.5 ] ) .    in order to obtain the inverse temperature according to ( [ 2.3 ] ) and ( [ 2.4 ] ) one has to average the following quantity , called @xmath29 for short @xmath30 where we use the notation @xmath31 . to compare with the heisenberg case@xcite of a three dimensional vector confined to a sphere one identifies @xmath32 as the third component of the angular momentum operator @xmath33 used in quantum mechanics , only `` @xmath34 '' is missing .",
    "eq.[2.6 ] can then be viewed as a reduced form of a micro - canonical temperature for a heisenberg spin system with the complete angular momentum operator @xmath35 @xmath36 instead of only the third component of @xmath37 appearing in eq.([2.6 ] ) .    for large system sizes @xmath38 the quantity to be averaged in ( [ 2.6 ] ) can be simplified .",
    "the two terms generated by differentiation are @xmath39 where the last one can be neglected since it is only of order @xmath40 .",
    "the reason is the short range of exchange interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath41 connects a spin @xmath42 only to its neighbors so that the differentiation with respect to @xmath19 is nonzero for @xmath43 and @xmath44 close to @xmath34 . as a result",
    "the second term scales as @xmath45 since a single sum in the numerator is outweighed by a double sum in the denominator . also for large spin systems neglecting again @xmath40corrections",
    "one can take the inverse of ( [ 2.9 ] ) to determine the temperature @xmath46 directly as an average of @xmath47 that is @xmath48 .",
    "although there exist no dynamical equations which conserve the energy for @xmath0spin systems , there is a so  called `` over  relaxation algorithm '' in use to generate spin configurations of equal energy .",
    "this algorithm is used in conjunction with the standard metropolis procedure , see for example @xcite , to diminish the effects of critical slowing down@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian we want to study is @xmath49 where the sum is over the exchange constants @xmath50 connecting close spins at sites @xmath34 and @xmath51 . in an equivalent notation this is @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "the energy @xmath54 contributed by an individual spin @xmath55 is @xmath56 with @xmath57 . to get the total energy @xmath58 one has to sum over all sites of the lattice and",
    "since the exchange interaction appears twice the sum has to be divided by two .",
    "the `` local '' energy @xmath54 depends on the `` molecular '' field @xmath59 generated by the neighbors .",
    "it does not change if @xmath60 this is the basic step of the `` over  relaxation '' algorithm which in geometrical terms means a change of @xmath42 to its mirror position with the mirror line given by @xmath59 as in fig.1 . in the simulation the spins to be updated are mostly chosen randomly@xcite .    using the special form for the hamiltonian ( [ 2.11 ] ) the formula for the temperature ( [ 2.10 ] )",
    "simplifies to @xmath61 since summing the second derivative of the hamiltonian @xmath58 with respect to all angles @xmath19 one recovers @xmath58 merely multiplied by @xmath62 .",
    "the easiest way to test the validity of the temperature determination by averaging ( [ 2.14 ] ) is to apply the over  relaxation algorithm to a spin chain .",
    "however , this algorithm for a linear chain with @xmath63 would be non ergodic in the case that all exchange constants are equal@xcite . in alternating the exchange by @xmath64 along the chain",
    "one has a remedy for this defect easy to implement .",

    "this means that the flow in phase space @xmath76 across @xmath18 should be the same as the `` natural '' flow given by ( [ 3.1 ] ) which is perpendicular to the @xmath18 surface .",
    "the constraint ( [ 3.2 ] ) leaves enough room for choices better fitted to specific heat calculations as will be shown .    for a chain a variant to @xmath76 is @xmath80 and one",

    "is assumed that @xmath41 is of the exchange type restricted to nearest neighbors like ( [ 2.11 ] ) or specifically ( [ 2.15 ] ) for the one dimensional case .",

    "for the temperature determination the inverse of ( [ 3.4 ] ) without the @xmath40correction is sufficient , that is we take @xmath84 and determine the temperature by @xmath85 .",
    "the energy @xmath41 or @xmath11 in the denominator is obtained by summing up the second derivatives , that is @xmath86 .",

    "the second term comes from the energy dependence of the normalization necessary for the temperature average .",
    "the definition ( [ 3.5 ] ) leads to the first two terms in the expanded form of the next line whereas the two last terms are generated by using ( [ 3.4 ] ) for @xmath89 . with @xmath90 and @xmath91 the ` 1 ' in ( [ 3.6 ] )",
    "disappears and only terms @xmath45 remain .",
    "this is to be expected since the reciprocal of the specific heat behaves as @xmath92 .",
    "one notices that the inverse of the specific heat depends on the temperature fluctuation . as a further simplification the averages of the last term of ( [ 3.7 ] )",
    "can be taken separately for the denominator and the numerator by neglecting @xmath93 corrections .",
    "further the average of the denominator is simply @xmath94 since @xmath95 according to ( [ 3.5 ] ) .",
    "the difference to the true average would result again in a @xmath93 correction and can therefore safely be neglected .",
    "taking the simplifications into account , the specific heat is then @xmath96 no further simplifications are possible . in the last term appears the local energy @xmath97 besides the square of the `` torque '' @xmath98 used for the temperature determination . to get an understanding of the average of these two quantities",
    "let us define a local energy deviation @xmath99 .",
    "the @xmath100 value is determined by splitting the average of ( [ 3.8 ] ) into two parts @xmath101 such that the first term depending on the local energy fluctuations should vanish .",
    "the average of the second term is @xmath102 according to ( [ 3.5 ] ) .",
    "the inverse of the specific heat ( [ 3.8 ] ) is then @xmath103 which at low temperatures with @xmath104 should reduce to @xmath105 a form derivable ( see appendix ) for a chain of harmonic oscillators with the temperature fluctuation @xmath106 so that @xmath107 . at low temperatures",
    "one expects @xmath108 , since the @xmath0spin chain should have the same specific heat as a harmonic oscillator chain .    to get the specific heat of the @xmath0chain shown in fig.2 relation ( [ 3.8 ] ) has been used . at low temperatures the specific heat for one spin",
    "is @xmath109 as expected .",
    "the strategy to calculate the specific heat for a chain can also be used for two or three dimensional lattices . for square and simple cubic lattices a decomposition in two sublattices analogously to the even odd decomposition for the chain can be made .",
    "a spin is even or odd if the sum of its coordinates @xmath110 is even or odd .",
    "the point is that the no nearest neighbor `` bond '' @xmath111 appears twice in different components which is the case for the vector @xmath112 defined by ( [ 3.3 ] ) . as a consequence only local energy and temperature terms have to be averaged . for a chain and a simple cubic lattice starting from all `` even '' or all `` odd '' sites all the interactions @xmath111",
    "are taken into account and @xmath113 for @xmath114 _ even _ , _",
    "odd_. so after renumbering the spins ( [ 3.8 ] ) can be used without further changes . as an example",
    "we show in fig.3 the specific heat of the @xmath1model on a simple cubic lattice obtained this way . only close to the critical region differences between the canonical simulation using the metropolis method and the micro  canonical simulation are visible .    in the general case , for a face centered cubic lattice as an example , slight changes have to be made .",
    "the fcc lattices can be thought to consist of four sublattices , one simple cubic lattice and three additional ones shifted in the three direction @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 to the centers of the faces of a cube .",
    "if one picks out one of these simple cubic lattices one can take over all the equations from the last section for the chain , only the energy connected to that sublattice is no longer a constant since is not the total energy . with @xmath118 of lattice points of the simple cubic lattice , that is @xmath119 the total number the spins , the temperature analogous to ( [ 3.5 ] ) is @xmath120 where the summation takes into account all angles @xmath121 of one of the cubic sublattices with number @xmath122 .",
    "the partial energy is @xmath123 . in a sense one has four thermometers which should of course give the same temperature .",
    "similarly one can calculate the specific heat starting from one sublattice .",
    "we studied the anti - ferromagnetic transition on a fcc lattice ( see section v ) , but the specific heat calculation with formulas similar to ( [ 3.8 ] ) did not give stable results in the neighborhood of the first order transition because of the singular nature of the specific heat .",
    "in principle the scaling behavior close to a second order phase transition should be the same for a canonical ensemble and for a micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "so one expects for a micro - canonical ensemble close to the critical energy that the `` measured '' temperature should dependent on the size of the system .",
    "this corresponds to the size dependence of the energy for a canonical ensemble at the critical temperature@xcite .",
    "the correlation length @xmath124 grows like @xmath125 for a temperature close to the critical temperature @xmath126 .",
    "this length @xmath124 can not become larger than the size @xmath127 of a finite system . in a micro - canonical simulation at the critical energy",
    "@xmath128 this finite size effect should be directly visible .",
    "since the system size takes the role of the correlation length , the recorded temperature @xmath129 should deviate from its critical value @xmath126 according to @xmath130 that is by rewriting @xmath131 as an equation . in fig.4 the size dependence of the critical temperature",
    "is plotted and one sees that the temperature defined as an average of ( [ 2.6 ] ) reproduces the expected effect .",
    "we took as the critical temperature @xmath132 found by schultka et al.@xcite .",
    "in the temperature scaling analysis we should recover the temperature these authors started with that is the value @xmath133 determined by janke@xcite .",
    "this is actually the case , since we find @xmath134 .    for a canonical system where the temperature is fixed by its critical value",
    "@xmath126 the critical energy @xmath128 has finite size corrections . loosely speaking one has @xmath135 in the neighborhood of the critical point . the linear dependence between energy changes @xmath136 and temperature changes @xmath137",
    "is modified to a power law dependence by the specific heat exponent @xmath138 . with this modification",
    "the finite size correction of the critical energy follows in close analogy to ( [ 4.1 ] ) @xmath139 from @xmath140 .",
    "the relation ( [ 4.2 ] ) has been used to determine the critical energy@xcite . for an @xmath1system practically the same exponent for the micro - canonical scaling according to ( [ 4.1 ] ) or the canonical one using ( [ 4.2 ] ) can be taken , since @xmath138 is very small@xcite . actually in ( [ 4.2 ] ) a correction term @xmath141 has been added to ( [ 4.2 ] ) . in the analysis of (",
    "[ 4.1 ] ) the corresponding correction is also needed , as can be seen in fig.4 .",
    "we test the over - relaxation algorithm by studying the dynamical scaling behavior@xcite . to use this procedure one should start with a configuration as far as possible from equilibrium with an energy fixed to its critical value .",
    "we take a random configuration for the spins as a starting configuration .",
    "it turns out to have an energy close to zero . by moving the spins step by step in integrating the differential equation ( [ 2.19 ] ) the energy",
    "is increased until the critical value is reached",
    ". then with the of over  relaxation dynamics the energy stays always at the critical value , but the correlation length should start growing like @xmath142 as a function of the number of update steps @xmath143 . finally after many steps",
    "the equilibrium situation is reached , that is for @xmath144 .",
    "therefore the temperature as a function of a moderate number of updates @xmath143 should follow a power law relation like ( [ 4.1 ] ) @xmath145 using @xmath146 .",
    "the magnetization @xmath147 exhibits more clearly the power law dependence , since no constant term must be subtracted .",
    "it should depend on the update steps @xmath143 like @xmath148 this corresponds to @xmath149 or @xmath150 , valid for finite size scaling with the exponent @xmath100 for the susceptibility .",
    "the rule of transcription is simply that one should replace @xmath127 by @xmath151 .",
    "since @xmath152 is small we take 1 for the ratio @xmath153 .",
    "we used two slightly different ways for the implementation of the over  relaxation algorithm .",
    "the first one consists of choosing randomly the spins to be updated .",
    "the second method uses a sequential update .",
    "the lattice is partitioned into two sublattices corresponding to the up and down sublattices of an anti  ferromagnet .",
    "since the interaction is only between nearest neighbors the numbering of the spin used for the sequential update does not matter . first the the spin vectors sitting on the up ",
    "spin sites are updated and then the others .",
    "technically one decides whether an index is even or odd before one starts with the over  relaxation .",
    "a spin is an even or odd one if the sum of its coordinates @xmath110 is even or odd .",
    "taking the results of the simulation depicted in fig.5 one notices that with @xmath154 the sequential update is the more efficient algorithm . however , to be more on the safe side concerning ergodicity one might prefer the random update with @xmath155 .",
    "since always half the total number of spins are `` turned around '' the greater efficiency of the sequential update might be connected to the nonlocal nature of the update reminiscent of the very efficient cluster algorithms .",
    "the micro - canonical technique can be shown to be most suitable in simulating first order transitions .",
    "a @xmath1spin model having such a transition is an anti - ferromagnet on the fcc  lattice . for simplicity",
    "we take only the interaction between nearest neighbors .",
    "this model has been analysed by diep and kawamura @xcite using standard monte carlo techniques .",
    "there the first order nature of the transition for @xmath1 and heisenberg spins was shown .",
    "especially for an ising model the frustrated anti - ferromagnetic order on a fcc  lattice leads to a strong first order transition @xcite . for",
    "the vector spins this phenomenon is less pronounced .",
    "the temperature for a large range of energies has been determined and the region between 1.35 and 1.55 was scanned more carefully .",
    "the energies are all positive and therefore all temperatures negative since we kept the convention of the preceding sections that the ferromagnet has the lowest energy and the exchange constant @xmath156 . in the inset of fig.6 the s  shape of the energy versus",
    "temperature dependence clearly indicates the first order nature of the transition .",
    "we want to analyse in greater detail the data for the largest lattice with @xmath157 spins .",
    "the idea is to use maxwell s equal area construction to determine the transition temperature .",
    "a direct approach is not advisable since the statistical errors for the temperature changes are quite large .",
    "a better way is to determine first the entropy @xcite . with the energy density @xmath158 , the entropy density @xmath159 , the reciprocal temperature @xmath160 and @xmath161 one obtains the entropy by integrating @xmath162 the logarithm of the density of states @xmath10 as the entropy",
    "is changed by subtracting @xmath163 , that is @xmath164 .",
    "this probability @xmath165 depicted in fig.7 has the double peak form of the histograms one obtains by counting the frequency an energy @xmath11 occurs in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the peaks must have equal height at the transition temperature corresponding to maxwell s equal area rule .",
    "the temperature we find by this procedure is @xmath166 .",
    "however , in looking at the insert of fig.a considerable one can observe a consiberable size dependence .",
    "the energy difference between the two maxima @xmath167 gives an estimate for the latent heat .",
    "one can also read off from fig.7 the difference in the logarithm of the probabilities @xmath168 , that is for @xmath169 at the peaks and for the minimum between the peaks .",
    "since the cluster has @xmath170 spins the ratio @xmath171 or @xmath172 is already too small for a standard monte carlo simulation . in upgrading the weights by using the `` multi - canonical '' method this low probability problem is circumvented . with the micro - canonical procedure no modification seems to be necessary here .",
    "however , first order transitions are beset of hysteresis phenomena , they are bound to occur also in micro - canonical simulations .",
    "we confirmed that the temperature calculation as averages given by ( [ 2.10 ] ) and ( [ 2.14 ] ) give reliable results .",
    "the severe tests were ( a ) the size dependence of the temperature for a second order transitions and ( b ) the non monotonic dependence of the temperature on the energy in the neighbour  hood of a first order transition .",
    "further we wanted to demonstrate that efficient micro - canonical simulations for vector spins are feasible making use of the over relaxation algorithm .",
    "however , since the histogram technique is missing , the critical energy can not be determined precisely by binder s cumulant technique@xcite . for first order transitions",
    "the method appears suitable .",
    "the inverse of the specific heat as the derivative of the temperature with respect to energy is linked to averages of fluctuations .",
    "they are far more complicated than the energy fluctuation one has to calculate for the specific heat in the canonical ensemble .",
