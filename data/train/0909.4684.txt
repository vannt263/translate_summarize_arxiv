    "the latter are related to observables by the so - called @xmath2-factorization . if we are in a regime where multiple scattering / saturation effects are large , such as in the case of a nuclear target , the linear @xmath2 factorization breaks down and observables are in general nonlinear functionals the unintegrated glue @xcite . the nuclear unintegrated glue @xmath3 is defined in terms of the forward scattering amplitude of a @xmath4 dipole @xmath5 at impact parameter @xmath6 , @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 has the meaning of bjorken s gap survival probability . to construct the nuclear unintegrated glue ,",

    "interestingly , the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) also has a simple unitarity cut interpretation : namely @xmath3 is proportional to the quasielastic quark  nucleus cross section , and the @xmath16-th term in eq.([expansion ] ) is the contribution from @xmath16 cut pomerons @xcite .",

    "in particular it can not be written in terms of the square of the integrated gluon distribution .    in the practical solution of the evolution equation eq.([bk ] )",
    "one integrates over all transverse momenta , from soft to hard , and some regularization in the infrared domain is inevitable .",
    "for example , we freeze the running coupling @xmath35 at small momenta .",
    "it is also necessary to introduce a finite gluon correlation radius @xmath36 , to remove unphysical long - range gluon exchange contributions .",
    "notice that this can be done without upsetting the gauge cancellations in the kernel , as it would be the case e.g. for a sharp momentum cutoff .",
    "results from a numerical solution are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath37 was constructed in terms of a free  nucleon glue fitted to hera data .",
    "we used @xmath38 .",
    "we plot @xmath39 , which is propotional to the phase space density of gluons . instead of impact parameter @xmath6",
    "we changed variables to the effective opacity @xmath20 .",
    "larger @xmath20 corresponds to more central , and smaller @xmath20 to more peripheral collisions .",
    "the position of the maximum in fig.[fig1 ] is a good definition of the saturation scale .",
    "we observe , that it is a function of the opacity as well as of @xmath23 .",
    "it increases for more central collisions ( where absorption is stronger ) as well as for smaller @xmath23 .",
    "notice that the evolution of the saturation scale with @xmath20 is a result of the dynamics , and does not involve an assumption its impact  parameter dependence .",
    "for the boundary condition , the saturation scale is in the soft ( for small @xmath20 ) to semihard ( for large @xmath20 ) regime .",
    "we need to go to very small @xmath40 to finally leave the soft region behind .",
    "notice however that for most observables an average over @xmath20 is implied , and the contribution from the impulse approximation ( or lowest order in @xmath16 ) is never really small ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we have no space here to explain here in detail the formalism of nonlinear @xmath2factorization , which principal feature is that cross sections of hard processes in a nuclear environment are highly nonlinear functionals ( quadratures ) of the collective nuclear unintegrated glue @xcite . the emerging nonlinear @xmath2-factorization formulas for the hard dijet spectra we shown to fall into several universality classes depending on color properties of the underlying pqcd subprocess @xcite .",
    "these classes differ in the character of incoherent initial state and final state interactions and coherent distortions of two - parton fock states of the incident parton .",
    "of special interest are reactions in which both the direct photon and the accompanying ( balancing , recoiling ) quark jet are observed .",
    "we shall refer to such final states as dijets .",
    "the production of such @xmath45 dijets can be viewed , in the nucleus rest frame , as an an excitation of the @xmath45 fock state of the incident quark , @xmath46 . as with all dijet",
    "observables @xcite , the dijet spectrum is obtained in terms of multiparton s - matrices of four ( @xmath47) , three(@xmath48) and two(@xmath4)parton states . in distinction to purely qcd  processes , however there is a great simplification due to the fact that the @xmath49 does not interact through multigluon exchanges . as a consequence ,",
    "the problem _ abelianizes _ , and all multiparton @xmath50matrices can be reduced to the ones of @xmath4states .",
    "the emerging dijet spectrum is then a _ linear _ functional of the unintegrated glue .    on the free nucleon target ,",
    "we obtain for the parton ",
    "level cross section : @xmath51 with @xmath52 and the splitting function @xmath53 here @xmath54 are the photon s light  cone momentum fraction and transverse momentum , @xmath55 .",
    "the decorrelation momentum @xmath56 measures the deviation of the dijet sustem from the back  to  back situation .",
    "it is worth to point out that the spectrum ( [ free_nucleon ] ) is exact over the full phasespace of the @xmath45 system . in particular",
    "notice the collinear pole at @xmath57 from the final state photon emission of the scattered quark .",
    "it corresponds to the `` monojet '' configuration , where the @xmath45 system recoils against a jet at a large distance in rapidity .",
    "for the nuclear target we obtain : @xmath58   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times p_{\\gamma q}(z ) \\ ,   k({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ p$ } } , { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ p$}}- z{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\delta$ } } ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "a main result of this work is that the decorrelation momentum distribution maps out the nuclear unintegrated glue .",
    "notice that a potential diffractive contribution @xmath59 , which would violate the linear @xmath2factorization , vanishes on a heavy nucleus , where the momentum transfer distribution is @xmath60-function  like . for a recent discussion of @xmath49particle correlations in the framework of the color  glass  condensate model ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "nuclear effects are conveniently characterized by the ratio ( here we stay at the parton ",
    "level throughout ) @xmath61 a similar ratio is the central  to  peripheral ratio , which involves only nuclear quantities : @xmath62 interestingly , both these ratios do not depend on the photon s transverse momentum @xmath44 .",
    "we show the ratio @xmath63 at @xmath64 for different opacities in the top panel of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we observe a shadowing at small values of @xmath65 and a cronin  type peak which position reflects the @xmath20-dependent saturation scale . in the lower panel",
    "we show @xmath42 and its evolution with @xmath23 . while it displays the same cronin  peak as @xmath63 for @xmath64 , the latter is entirely quenched at small @xmath23 .",
    "we presented a nuclear unintegrated glue from the solution of a nonlinear small@xmath23 evolution equation .",
    "jet correlations in the proton fragmentation region of @xmath0 collisions have been suggested as a direct probe of the nuclear unintegrated glue .",
    "they may present an opportunity to measure the saturation scale at the lhc .",
