    "successful implementation of quantum information processing ( qip ) requires not only invention of new quantum algorithms such as shor algorithm , quantum error correction code or quantum adiabatic algorithm , but also further hardware development , i.e. realization of various qubit architectures - from trapped atoms to superconducting circuits.@xcite a significant advantage of solid state systems , based on different types of quantum dots@xcite or impurities in semiconductors,@xcite is a capability to fabricate , manipulate and read out qubits using semiconductor nanotechnology and conventional electronics . on the other hand , all reliable and efficient qip schemes simultaneously require both long qubit decoherence times@xcite and controllable qubit manipulation , which poses a major challenge for practical implementation of these systems .    indeed",
    ", shallow donor spin qubits in semiconductors have a number of advantages related to these requirements due to tunable spin - lattice interaction and a possibility to control spin states without a charge - induced noise . at the same time , broadly investigated silicon - based donor qubits with large spin dechorence times suffer from limitations in controlling and manipulating spins due to weak spin - orbit interaction.@xcite here we suggest a route for implementing new spin - qubit architectures based on donor spins embedded in specially crafted germanium structures ( quasi - two - dimensional periodic phononic crystals or planar phonon waveguides ) with large spin - orbit interaction of the ge host and engineered phonon bangaps to simultaneously suppress spin decoherence and enable strong spin - spin coupling between the qubits .",
    "the large spin - orbit coupling inherent to shallow donors in bulk ge enhances our ability to manipulate the spin qubits but could be detrimental for their coherence .",
    "in fact , the spin relaxation time of donors in ge bulk is three to four orders of magnitude shorter than that in si . to cope with this problem",

    "the phonon dispersion curves , shown in fig .  [ fig : phc]b , display pronounced gap in the frequency interval 13@xmath115 ghz . if the zeeman energy of the donor spin @xmath2 is tuned inside the phonon gap the one - phonon spin - flip transitions will be forbidden due to energy conservation . as a result",

    "hamiltonian ( \\ref{eq : h } ) has several peculiarities that make donor arrays in ge phononic crystals stand out compared with similar systems based on other materials such as si .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the coupling of the ground - state zeeman doublet with the elastic strain is enabled by the $ g$-factor anisotropy $ \\delta g = g_\\bot - g_\\|$ , which , in turn , is induced by the spin - orbit interaction and depends on the effective mass anisotropy .",
    "the latter two factors are much stronger in ge ( $ \\delta g / g\\simeq 0.5 $ ) than in si ( $ \\delta g / g\\simeq 1.5\\times 10^{-3}$ ) . as a result , the coupling constant $ k$ in ge ranges from $ 1\\times 10 ^ 3 $ for as donor to $ 7.5\\times 10 ^ 3 $ for sb donor , exceeding similar values for si by about three orders in magnitude .",
    "second , because of the valley symmetry , the spin - orbit interaction in ge couples the donor spins only to shear components of the strain tensor $ \\varepsilon_{xy}$ ,    $ \\varepsilon_{xz}$ , etc .",
    "( note that $ \\alpha\\ne\\beta$ in eq.~(\\ref{eq : h } ) ) .",
    "this creates a simple way to protect the spin qubits from detrimental effects of static random strains .",
    "indeed , the random strain hamiltonian is similar to the last term in eq.~(\\ref{eq : h } ) :   $ h_r=\\hbar k\\omega_z \\sum_{n,\\alpha\\ne \\beta } \\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\bm{r}_n)\\hat\\sigma_{n,\\alpha } h_\\beta$ , where $ \\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\bm{r}_n)$ is a random quantity fluctuating from site to site .",
    "for the magnetic field in $ z$-direction $ h_r$ does not contain $ \\hat\\sigma_z$ , which implies that the first order correction to $ g$ vanishes,\\cite{roth:1960 } since $ \\delta g \\propto   { \\langle\\pm| } h_r { |\\pm\\rangle}=0 $ ( here $ { |\\pm\\rangle}$ are eigenstates of $ \\hat\\sigma_z$ ) . for a typical random strain fluctuation   with r.m.s .",
    "$ \\delta\\varepsilon\\sim 10^{-6}$,\\cite{wilson:1964 } the second oder correction , $ \\delta g / g\\sim ( k\\delta\\varepsilon)^2\\simeq 10^{-6}$ is negligible .",
    "this finding is confirmed by experimental observations revealing    strong anisotropy in the inhomogeneous esr line - broadening for ge donors due to random strains~and a drastic narrowing of the lines for [ 001 ] direction of the magnetic field.\\cite{wilson:1964 }     based on the above we will assume that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the phononic crystal ( to eliminate random strain noise ) and that $ \\omega_z$ lies inside the phonon band gap ( to suppress single - phonon decoherence processes ) . in what follows we will use the interaction picture with unperturbed hamiltonian $ \\hat h_0= \\hat{h}_z + \\hat{h}_{ph}$ and $ \\hat h_{s\\mhyphen ph}$ taken as a perturbation .",

    "our numerical estimates show that this renormalization $ \\delta\\omega_z$ is insignificant and constitutes at most $ \\delta\\omega_z/\\omega_z \\sim 10^{-4}$.   thus we will concentrate on the interqubit hamiltonian $ \\hat{h}_{s\\mhyphen s}$ and use renormalized values of $ \\omega_z\\rightarrow   \\omega_z+\\delta\\omega_z$ in eq.~(\\ref{eq : jnm } ) .",
    "notably , the dynamics of the system with $ \\omega_z$ in the gap is non - dissipative to   the second order in $ g_{\\bm{q}\\nu}$ and is governed by the exchange hamiltonian $ h_{s\\mhyphen s}$ in agreement with our initial claim .",
    "the hamiltonian ( \\ref{eq : hss } ) lays out a foundation of the proposed qip architecture . before proceedings with qip applications of the hamiltonian ( \\ref{eq : hss } )   we will address physical implications of   eqs~(\\ref{eq : hss } ) and ( \\ref{eq : jnm } ) ,   investigate asymptotic behavior   of the exchange integrals , and estimate spin decoherence time due to two - phonon processes .",
    "the most interesting property of the phonon mediated exchange is a possibility to tune   magnitude and the range of qubit - qubit interaction by changing the zeeman splitting .",
    "\\subsection{properties of donor - based spin qubits . }",
    "to better understand the properties of the hamiltonian ( \\ref{eq : hss } ) we will examine asymptotic behavior of the exchange integrals . without any loss of generality",
    "we assume that near extrema of the phonon band $ \\bm{q}_0 $ ( either $ \\gamma$ or $ m$-points of the brillouin   zone ) $ \\omega(\\bm{q})\\simeq\\omega_0(1+l^2\\delta q^2/2)$ , where $ \\delta\\bm{q}=\\bm{q}-\\bm{q}_0 $ and   we introduced a characteristic length $ l$ ,   which describes dispersion of   $ \\omega(\\bm{q})$ near $ \\bm{q}_0$.   since $ \\bm{q}$ is two - dimensional the exchange integrals depend only on a projection $ \\bm{\\rho}_{nm}$ of $ \\bm{r}_{nm}=\\bm{r}_n-\\bm{r}_m$ onto the $ ( x , y)$-plane of the phononic crystal .",

    "furthermore , when these energies are near the edge of the phonon band gap the interaction becomes extremely long - range .",
    "finally , we calculate the longitudinal relaxation rate $ \\nu_1 $   at low ( $ \\ll \\hbar\\omega_z$ ) temperatures , which is determined by the two - phonon spin - flip transitions via emission of modes $ ( \\nu,{\\bf q})$ and $ ( \\nu_1,{\\bf q}_1)$. using the golden rule with the forth - order ( $ \\propto k^4 $ ) matrix elements we obtain : \\begin{equation } \\nu_1 = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar}\\sum\\limits_{\\nu { \\bf q}\\nu_1 { \\bf q}_1}g_{\\nu{\\bf q}}^2 g_{\\nu_1{\\bf q}_1}^2\\left| { \\frac{\\xi^{(\\nu { \\bf q})}\\cdot\\bxi^{(\\nu_1{\\bf q}_1 ) } } { \\hbar\\omega_z -\\hbar\\omega_{\\nu { \\bf q } } } } + ( \\nu{\\bf q}\\leftrightarrow \\nu_1{\\bf q}_1 ) \\right|^2 \\delta ( \\hbar\\omega_z -\\hbar\\omega_{\\nu { \\bf q}}-\\hbar\\omega_{\\nu_1 { \\bf q}_1 } ) .",
