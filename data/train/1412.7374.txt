    "dynamic process of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) in the heliosphere is key information for us to evaluate the cmes geo - effectiveness .",
    "but it becomes more complicated when successive cmes interact in the heliosphere .",
    "both observational and numerical studies have shown that cme s shape , velocity and direction may change significantly through collisions and interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "cmes are magnetized plasmoids . in most cases ,",
    "cmes could be treated as an elastic ball in the heliosphere due to low reconnection rate , and the collision between them was usually thought to be elastic or inelastic , through which the total kinetic energy of colliding cmes conserves or decreases . this classic collision picture was often used to analyze the momentum exchange during cme collisions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but the picture is sometimes failed to explain observations .",
    "for example , the analysis of 2010 august 1 cme - cme interaction event suggested that the collision between cmes is unlikely to be elastic or perfectly inelastic @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation is that the cme - driven shock if any may be involved in the momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "another explanation can be found in a most recent work about the cme - cme interaction event during november 28 , 2008 by @xcite , which for the first time revealed that the collision of cmes could be super - elastic .",
    "a fundamental definition of super - elastic collision is that the total kinetic energy of colliding system increases after the collision .",
    "it is unexpectedly beyond the classic collision picture , but well explains the observed track of the leading cme in that event .",
    "if super - elastic collision does happen , cme s effect on space weather needs to be re - evaluated because more thermal and magnetic energy inside cmes will be converted into kinetic energy , which may cause the changes of the direction and velocity of cmes different from usually expected .",
    "however , at present , the finding of super - elastic is doubtable , because the result was obtained based on the remote imaging data from stereo spacecraft and some highly ideal assumptions .",
    "thus a numerical simulation may favor us validating the possibility of cmes super - elastic collision .    in this letter",
    ", we carry out three - dimensional ( 3-d ) mhd simulations based on the observations of the 2008 november event , and try to reveal the nature of the cmes collision through the analysis of the energy transformation during the collision . in the next section , the mhd model and simulation method are introduced .",
    "the simulation results of the cmes collision and a comparison with a non - collision case are presented in section [ sec_result ] and [ sec_comp ] , respectively . in the last section , a summary and discussion is given .",
    "the numerical scheme we used is a 3-d corona - interplanetary total variation diminishing ( coin - tvd ) scheme in a sun - centered spherical coordinate system @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the projected characteristic boundary conditions @xcite are adopted at the lower boundary .",
    "the computational domain is set to cover @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the radial distance from solar center in units of solar radius @xmath5 , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the elevation and azimuthal angles , respectively .",
    "we first establish a steady state of background solar wind . the potential field extrapolated from the observed line - of - sight magnetic field on the photosphere and parker s solar wind solution",
    "are used as the initial magnetic field and velocity .",
    "the initial density is deduced from the momentum conservation law , and the initial temperature is given by assuming an adiabatic process . with these initial conditions , our mhd code may quickly reach a self - consistent and steady state of solar wind . figure  [ fg_bk ] presents the radial velocity of background solar wind and magnetic field lines , which shows the typical characteristics , e.g. , nearly axial - symmetric and dipolar , at solar minimum .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + the columns from the second one to the right are the propagation direction , velocity , number density , temperature , magnetic field , plasma beta , radius , and the kinetic , magnetic , thermal , gravitational and total energies , respectively .",
    "the values of the velocity of solar wind are at @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , in the direction of n11w18 .",
    "the energies of solar wind are the integration over the whole computational domain before cmes are introduced .",
    "as we did in the previous work , two cmes are modeled as magnetic blobs @xcite , and introduced successively with a separation time of 6 hours and their centers sitting at @xmath10 .",
    "hereafter , we use cme1 and cme2 for the first and second initiated cmes . to reproduce the 2008 november event , two key parameters , their initial propagation directions and velocities ,",
    "are chosen to be the same as those derived from observations @xcite .",
    "the directions of the two cmes are n06w28 and n16w08 , respectively , and the propagation speeds are 243 and 407 km s@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "another important parameter , plasma beta , is set a reasonable value of 0.06 for both cmes .",
    "according to the analysis of errors in @xcite , other parameters are not pivotal , and therefore set arbitrarily .",
    "table [ tb_cmes ] lists the initial parameters of the two cmes .",
    "the background solar wind between the directions of the two cmes gradually increases from about 316 km s@xmath11 at @xmath12 to about 433 km s@xmath11 at @xmath9 . due to the expansion ,",
    "the leading edges of the two cmes move faster than ambient solar wind .",
    "thus we locate the cmes by simply setting a threshold of 450 km s@xmath11 in the map of radial velocity .",
    "the time of introducing cme1 into computational domain is set to be zero .",
    "figure  [ fg_3dsim ] shows the 3-d view of the radial velocity distribution at @xmath137 , 10 and 15 hours , respectively . only the regions of the radial velocity equal to 450 and 600 km s@xmath11 are displayed for clarity . due to the selection effect",
    ", some shell structures are shown , but they do not reflect the real cme shape . the cmes can be recognized through the superimposed node - shaped magnetic field lines .    since cme2 is faster than cme1 , the two cmes get closer and closer as shown in the three panels .",
    "the momentum transfer could be clearly seen by noting the orange region . at 7 hours ,",
    "right before the collision , the orange region , which denotes a radial velocity of 600 km s@xmath11 , locates in cme2 .",
    "after the two cmes touch , the orange region moves forward , which suggests a momentum transfer from cme2 to cme1 .        with some limits of the mhd code ,",
    "however , we can not identify the exact boundary of a cme .",
    "thus we do not analyze the momentum or energy change for individual cmes , but instead , analyze the variations of all kinds of energies integrated over the whole computational domain .",
    "all the energies of the two cmes and solar wind at initial time are shown in table  [ tb_cmes ] .",
    "although the energy of the two cmes is only about 5% of the total energy of background solar wind , it is larger than the errors unavoidably from numerical calculations and ideal mhd assumptions as will be seen below .    , kinetic energy @xmath14 , magnetic energy @xmath15 , thermal energy @xmath16 and gravitational energy @xmath17 , respectively . in the top panel ,",
    "the black lines shows the total energy before correction ( see main text for details ) . ]",
    "the solid black line in the upper panel of figure  [ fg_energy ] shows the variation of the total energy , @xmath18 , an integrated value over the whole computational domain , after the launch of cme2 at @xmath19 hours .",
    "the quick drop of @xmath18 at the beginning is because the introduced cme expels the ambient solar wind .",
    "this is a numerical effect and brings difficulty into the analysis of energy variation . to reduce it",
    ", we first calculate the net energy flowing into the computational domain at boundaries in a time interval @xmath20 , which is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the energy density at time @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the surface of the boundaries , and then deduct it from the total energy to get a corrected energy .",
    "assume that the total energy at any given instant @xmath25 is @xmath26 and the net energy flow across the boundaries since the last instant @xmath27 is @xmath28 , the correct total energy is @xmath29 , which should be always equal to the total energy at initial time @xmath30 in theory .",
    "after the correction , the total energy varies in small range of about @xmath31 erg as shown by the solid blue line in the upper panel of figure  [ fg_energy ] , that just indicates the numerical error in our simulation .",
    "it is much smaller than the cme energies listed in table  [ tb_cmes ] .",
    "all kinds of energies after the correction are shown in the other panels in figure  [ fg_energy ] .",
    "after the two cmes propagate into the computational domain , the kinetic energy , @xmath14 , and gravitational energy , @xmath17 , both continuously increase , whereas the magnetic energy , @xmath15 , and thermal energy , @xmath16 , both decrease .",
    "the changes of these energies are all one order larger than the variation of total energy , suggesting a real physical process .",
    "the increase of @xmath17 is due to that the cmes carry a heavier plasma than background solar wind .",
    "the changes of other energies are consistent with the well - known picture that cme s magnetic and thermal energy will be converted into kinetic energy as it expands during the propagation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to validate that the kinetic energy gain ( or partial of it ) comes from a super - elastic collision , we need another case for comparison , in which the two cmes do not collide . to do this ,",
    "we adjust the longitude of cme2 to @xmath32 , which causes the longitudinal separation between the two cmes to be @xmath33 , and keep all the other parameters exactly the same as those in the case of collision .",
    "hereafter we use case 1 for collision , case 2 for non - collision and cme2@xmath34 for the second cme in case 2 . figure  [ fg_bk ]",
    "has shown that the background solar wind and magnetic structure around cme2 and cme2@xmath34 are quite similar .",
    "we believe that the two cases are comparable .",
    "from cme1 being introduced into computational domain to the instance of cme2 being introduced , the two cases are exactly the same .",
    "after cme2 is introduced , the two cases become different .",
    "the dashed blue lines in figure  [ fg_energy ] show the energy variations for case 2 , which are similar to those in case 1 except some small differences .",
    "these small differences are shown much clearly in figure  [ fg_diff ] .",
    "the difference of the total energy , @xmath35 , between the two cases has small fluctuations with an amplitude of about @xmath36 erg .",
    "it indicates the level of numerical error .",
    "the difference of the gravitational energy , @xmath37 , is about @xmath38 erg , smaller than the numerical error .",
    "thus we can not conclude if @xmath37 is real or not .",
    "for all the other energies , the differences are significantly larger than the error , and thought to be physically meaningful .",
    "it is found that , from the time of @xmath39 hours , the difference of the kinetic energy , @xmath40 , rapidly increases from about @xmath36 erg to about @xmath41 erg in 2 hours , and then decreases back to about @xmath42 erg and slowly returns .",
    "it means that there is extra kinetic energy gain in case 1 .",
    "recall that the energy flow across the boundaries has been deducted , and therefore the extra kinetic energy gain must come from the collision of the two cmes .",
    "although we do not know the kinetic energy for each cme , the comparison between case 2 and case 1 is just like the comparison between the state before and after the collision .",
    "the significant difference between the two cases in the kinetic energy does confirm that the collision of cmes could be super - elastic as suggested by @xcite .",
    "it is hard to identify when the collision ends",
    ". it might be at @xmath43 hours or even later .",
    "but we are sure that the two cmes have fully interacted for a long time .",
    "this long process allows magnetic and thermal energies to be converted into kinetic energy .",
    "it is noticed that the decrease of the magnetic energy is much larger than that of the thermal energy , which suggests that the magnetic energy stored in cmes are the major source of the extra kinetic energy gain .",
    "we have comparatively investigated the energy variation during the collision of two successive cmes .",
    "it is found that the kinetic energy gain in the case of collision is larger than that in the case of non - collision though the initial conditions of the two cmes and the background solar wind are exactly the same .",
    "this result does suggest that the collision between the two cmes is super - elastic , through which additional magnetic and thermal energies are converted into kinetic energy .    in this study ,",
    "the initial kinetic energy of the two cmes is about @xmath44 erg ( see table  [ tb_cmes ] ) .",
    "since the collision happens quickly after the introductions of the cmes , we may use this value approximately as the cmes kinetic energy right before the collision .",
    "the extra kinetic energy gain due to the collision is on the order of @xmath42 erg .",
    "it is therefore derived that the super - elastic collision of the two cmes causes their total kinetic energy increased by about 3%4% , which is close to the value of 6.6% given by @xcite . assuming the energy gain totally goes to cme1",
    ", we then estimate that the kinetic energy of cme1 increases by about 13% . normally , the leading cme will be accelerated and the trailing cme decelerated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus the percentage of the kinetic energy gain of cme1 should be even higher . in terms of velocity",
    ", cme1 is speeded up by at least 6% , i.e. , 15 km s@xmath11 .",
    "this number is not large enough to impact the space weather forecasting .",
    "but a comprehensive investigation of the effect of collision on the velocity and direction of cmes is still worth being pursued .    in this letter",
    ", we only consider the cmes similar to the 2008 november event .",
    "it is not clear if the collision between any cmes is super - elastic .",
    "moreover , some open questions remain .",
    "for example , how are the magnetic or thermal energies convert into kinetic energy ?",
    "how does magnetic reconnection influence the collision process and result if it efficiently occurred ?",
    "another interesting thing is that the 2010 august event studied by @xcite might be a case of ` super - inelastic ' collision , a process somewhat like merging , of two fast cmes .",
    "how and why could it happen ?",
    "all these questions are worthy of further studies .",
