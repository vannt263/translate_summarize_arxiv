    "the high - energy limit of the total cross - section of the @xmath1 leptons process was computed 30 years ago and found to be large @xcite : @xmath2",
    "@xmath3 @xmath4 this property is important enough for considering those processes as `` reference processes '' for luminosity measurements at high - energy @xmath5 colliders .",
    "as expected , the bulk of the cross - section is provided by kinematical regions where the outgoing lepton - pairs are close to the @xmath5 beam axis .",
    "this is clear from the paper by kuraev et al.@xcite where they computed single lepton angular spectrum at small angle in the `` logarithm approximation '' .",
    "it is worthwhile to check whether @xmath6 and/or @xmath7 could compete with single lepton - pair production which is the basic process for luminosity measurement .",
    "this requires an exact computation at relatively large angles .    besides",

    ", hybrid pairs production should be considered in @xmath10 studies .",
    "an exact computation of @xmath11 double lepton - pair production is also useful for heavy ions peripheral collisions and tesla .",
    "other interesting topics in astrophysics are the interactions of a high energy cosmic @xmath12 with background infrared ( ir ) @xmath12 , and with the earth atmosphere",
    ".    the @xmath13 single and double pair production from @xmath14 collisions have cross sections of the same order of magnitude around a squared invariant mass s@xmath15 of about 0.6 gev@xmath16 , obtained for example with 4 pev @xmath12 scattering on 35@xmath17 wavelength photons .",
    "their interaction with 2.7 k background ones is of course the dominant one .",
    "however this constant cross section should not be forgotten for ultrahigh energy photons .",
    "+ with @xmath18 asymptotic value , the ratio of @xmath19 and @xmath20 is of the order of @xmath21 and rather negligible in shower development .",
    "64 amplitudes are to be computed , as the basic ones shown in figure  [ fig - diag ] , including permutation and anti - symmetrisation for @xmath22 , where the exchanged @xmath12 is either space - like or time - like . at large angles ,",
    "masses can be neglected and we are left with 12 irreducible helicity amplitudes which are expressed in terms of two elementary functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,  la kleiss - stirling .",

    "in addition , to avoid numerical singularities which might arise for massless final particles , masses have been included in the propagators .    for cross - checking purposes ,",
    "two factorization approaches have been used and they are described in the following .",
    "we have checked that the factorization formula from carimalo et al .",
    "@xcite , gives by analytical integration the well - known high energy limit total cross section : @xmath26 the lepton - pair invariant mass spectra have been also derived .",
