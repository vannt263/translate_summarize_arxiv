    "<S> this is a short communication with a summary of results obtained with a model based on gribov s reggeon calculus , which was proposed and applied to processes of soft diffraction at high energies . </S>",

    "<S> regge theory @xcite is the main method for describing high - energy soft processes . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic behavior of the cross - sections of elastic scattering and multiple productions of hadrons is determined by the properties of the pomeron , the right - most pole singularity of the elastic amplitude in the complex - momentum plane ( @xmath0-plane ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed increase of the total cross - section with increasing energy makes it necessary to consider the pomeron with intercept @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of only the pomeron pole contribution in the elastic scattering amplitude leads to violation of the unitarity . </S>",
    "<S> this difficulty is removed by taking into account the contribution of branch points of the amplitude in the @xmath0-plane , which corresponds to the multi - reggeon exchange in the @xmath3-channel . </S>",
    "<S> a regge - pole exchange can be interpreted as a single scattering while branch points correspond to multiple scatterings on the constituents of hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> + the contribution of the branch points involved in the exchange of several reggeons associated with @xmath4 etc . </S>",
    "<S> decreases very quickly with increasing collision energy and the contribution of such branch points can be neglected with respect to the branch points due to the exchange of one of them and any number of pomerons . in the eikonal approximation , where the interaction between pomerons is neglected </S>",
    "<S> , the elastic scattering amplitude can be parametrized by the sum of diagrams shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : multireggeexchange ] . +        in these graphs , the wavy lines labeled with @xmath5 correspond to pomeron and reggeon exchanges , whereas the wavy lines labeled with @xmath6 correspond only to pomeron exchange . </S>",
    "<S> the account of the multi - pomeron exchange restores unitarity of the scattering amplitude , which leads to a behavior of the total cross - section for @xmath7 : @xmath8 , which satisfies the froissart bound . </S>",
    "<S> + for the analysis of @xmath9 and @xmath10 total and elastic cross - section data we saturate the matrix elements by the contribution of @xmath11- and @xmath12- reggeons . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we assume @xmath13 for @xmath9 collisions and @xmath14 for @xmath10 ones . </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the processes of single- and double- diffraction dissociation are closely related to small angle elastic scattering in which each of the incoming hadrons may become a system , which will then decay into a number of stable final state particles . in high energy physics , diffraction is usually defined as any process involving pomeron exchange . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , there is no possibility to distinguish processes that are caused by pomeron exchange from those that are caused by reggeon ( e.g. @xmath11-trajectory ) exchange . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we define diffraction dissociation as the exchange of both pomeron and reggeon . in @xcite it is proposed to describe data on soft diffraction dissociation in @xmath9 and @xmath10 interactions by taking into account all possible non - enhanced absorptive corrections to triple - regge vertices and loop diagrams ( see fig .  </S>",
