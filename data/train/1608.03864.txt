    "the mean squared error ( mse ) has long been the dominant quantitative performance metric in the field of signal processing .",
    "an estimator which minimizes the mse is referred to as a minimum mse ( mmse ) estimator . in target",
    "tracking @xcite , the traditional problem is posed as the finding of the mmse estimate of the target states . since",
    "the mmse estimate is given by the expected value of the posterior probability density function , which intrinsically has an ordering ( labeling ) of the states , the mmse estimator can be classified as a labeled estimator . in some applications",
    "the labeling of the objects is not relevant . for these problems ,",
    "it is more reasonable to instead of minimizing the mse try to minimize a measure which eschews target labeling .",
    "a measure that has received an increasing amount of attention in the later years , and which can be seen as a natural extension of the mse to label - free estimation , is the ospa metric @xcite .",
    "the ospa is a label - free correspondent to the squared error .",
    "the mospa , which is the counterpart of the mse , was introduced in @xcite where the authors also described how to calculate the mmospa estimates .",
    "explicit solutions for mmospa estimation are only available in the scalar case @xcite . in @xcite and",
    "references therein , various techniques for approximating mmospa estimates are presented . in @xcite ,",
    "a connection between the empirical mmospa estimate and the wasserstein barycenter for point cloud was established .",
    "this result builds upon the lemma 1 in @xcite which states that the wasserstein distance coincides with the mospa for empirical probability densities defined on sets with the same cardinality .",
    "the wasserstein distance defined using empirical probability densities can be computed solving a linear programming ( lp ) problem @xcite .",
    "the lp formulation of the transportation problem , is also known as the hitchcock - koopmans transportation problem @xcite .",
    "the results of this letter are twofold :    * we extend the result in @xcite for a wider class of probability measures , to draw a theoretical connection between the mospa measure and the more general transportation problem , known as monge - kantorovich transportation problem @xcite . *",
    "this main finding , in conjunction with a recent result in computational geometry @xcite , allows us to provide new insights on mospa estimation revealing interesting geometrical structure and properties of the mmospa estimates .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : probform ] we formalize our problem .",
    "section [ sec : mainresults ] contains our main theoretical contributions and also provides a geometrical interpretation of the mmospa and in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",

    "theorem 2 from @xcite shows that , the optimal partition of the space @xmath68 which achieves @xmath69 exists , it is unique and it is given by the additive weighted voronoi regions defined as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a set of centroids and @xmath72 is a set of real numbers .",

    "[ remark1 ] the results in @xcite and in general in transportation theory @xcite hold for general distances than euclidean and the geometrical properties from proposition  [ prop1 ] remain still valid .",
    "for example , in the case of a more general distance gospa ( general ospa ) : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a positive definite matrix , the additively weigthed voronoi diagrams are no longer symmetric ( i.e. @xmath83 , the new separating hyperplane will be closer to one of the two mmospa estimates ( circles in the figure ) . ] .",
    "lastly , if more general distances are used @xcite , the voronoi diagrams will be separated by more general manifolds than hyperplanes @xcite .",
    "the main result of this letter establishes the equivalence between the mospa measure , which is a concept widely used in target tracking community , and wasserstein distance between one continuous measure and one discrete measure .",
    "this finding allowed us to draw a connection with a recent result in computational geometry @xcite , which showed that additively weigthed voronoi diagrams can optimally solve some cases of the monge - kantorovich transportation problem , with one measure being discrete .",
    "more specifically , we were able to show that mmospa estimates are exactly equal to the centroid of these voronoi diagrams for a particular choice of the weights .",
    "revealing geometrical structures for the mmospa estimates advances our understanding of the mospa estimation problem drawing upon different scientific fields . in the future we are planning to extend the current results , if possible , to the more general case of mospa measure defined for sets with different cardinalities",
