    "airborne surveillance radar systems operate in a severe and dynamic interference environments , which may be composed of clutter and jamming .",
    "space - time adaptive processing ( stap ) employing a joint - domain optimization of the spatial and temporal degrees - of - freedom ( dofs ) has become a key enabling technology for advanced airborne radar applications @xcite .",
    "although a significant increase in output signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) compared with traditional approaches can potentially be achieved , the large computational complexity of full - rank stap , which has order @xmath0 due to a covariance matrix inversion operation where @xmath1 is the dimension of the full rank filter , prohibits its application in real - time .",
    "another complicated issue with full rank stap is that the filter with large number of elements requires a large number of samples to reach its steady - state behaviour while providing slow convergence speed and poor tracking performance @xcite . a cost - effective technique in short - data record scenarios and , in particular , for systems containing a large number of elements is reduced - rank signal processing .    in the comprehensive report by ward @xcite and the book by klemm @xcite",
    ", several @xmath2 @xmath3 reduced - rank methods were developed .",
    "the first statistical reduced - rank method was based on a principal - components ( pc ) decomposition of the target - free covariance matrix @xcite .",
    "another class of eigen - decomposition methods was based on the cross - spectral metric ( csm)@xcite .",
    "however , the pc and csm algorithms have the problem of heavy computational load due to the eigen - decomposition .",
    "the family of krylov subspace methods has been investigated thoroughly in the recent years .",
    "this class of reduced - rank adaptive filtering algorithms , including the multistage wiener filter ( mswf ) @xcite and auxiliary - vector filters ( avf ) @xcite , projects the observation data onto a lower - dimensional krylov subspace . despite the improved convergence and tracking performance achieved with these methods ,",
    "they are very complex to implement and suffer from numerical problems .",
    "the requirement for accurate estimation of the target - free covariance matrix is also an important issue which restricts the statistical reduced - rank stap algorithms .    in the present paper ,",
    "we develop a reduced - rank approach to the stap design utilizing an approach based on adaptive basis function approximation ( abfa ) .",
    "the novel scheme employs the well - known framework of side - lobe canceller ( slc ) @xcite structure and consists of selected sets of basis functions that perform dimensionality reduction and an adaptive reduced - rank filter .",
    "compared to traditional reduced - rank techniques , the proposed scheme works on an instantaneous basis , selecting the best suited set of basis functions at each instant to minimize the squared error .",
    "furthermore , we derive stochastic gradient ( sg ) and recursive least squares ( rls ) algorithm for efficiently implementing the proposed abfa scheme .",
    "the results for radar clutter and jamming suppression show a performance significantly better and lower complexity than existing reduced - rank schemes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : sig_model ] introduces the signal model and in section 3 , the proposed reduced - rank stap scheme is detailed , and the proposed adaptive algorithms and their complexity analysis are also presented in section 3 .",
    "examples of the performance of the proposed reduced - rank stap are provided in section 4 and conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "the system under consideration is a pulsed doppler radar residing on an airborne platform .",
    "the radar antenna is a uniformly spaced linear array antenna consisting of @xmath4 elements .",
    "radar returns are collected in a coherent processing interval ( cpi ) , which is referred to as the 3-d radar data - cube shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radar_data_syst](a ) , where @xmath5 denotes the number of samples collected to cover the range interval . the data is then processed at one range of interest , which corresponds to a slice of the cpi data - cube .",
    "this slice is a @xmath6 matrix which consists of @xmath7 spatial snapshots for @xmath8 pulses at the range of interest .",
    "it is convenient to stack the matrix column - wise to form the @xmath9 vector @xmath10 , termed a space - time snapshot @xcite . given a space - time snapshot , radar detection is a binary hypothesis problem , where hypothesis @xmath11 corresponds to target absence and hypothesis @xmath12 corresponds to target presence . the radar space - time snapshot is then expressed for each of the two hypotheses in the following form , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a complex gain and the vector @xmath15 , which is the @xmath16 normalized space - time steering vector in the space - time look - direction .",
    "the vector @xmath17 encompasses any undesired interference or noise component of the data including clutter @xmath18 , jamming @xmath19 and thermal noise @xmath20 .",
    "these three components are assumed to be mutually uncorrelated .",
    "thus , the @xmath21 covariance matrix @xmath22 of the undesired clutter - plus - jammer - plus - noise component can be modelled as @xmath23 where @xmath24 represents hermitian transpose , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote clutter , jamming and noise covariance matrix respectively . in practice , the interference - plus - noise covariance matrix @xmath22 is typically unknown .",
    "the common approach is to estimate it from the @xmath28 data set which does not contain the signal of interest ( @xmath29 ) . in this context",
    ", we can refer the interference - plus - noise covariance matrix @xmath22 as @xmath30 .",
    "the processing chain of a general stap radar is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radar_data_syst](b ) . to detect the presence of targets , each range bin is processed by an adaptive 2d beamformer ( to achieve maximum output sinr ) followed by a hypothesis test to determine the target presence or absence .",
    "the optimum full - rank stap @xcite is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a nonzero complex number . in practice , since @xmath30 is unknown , the processor substitutes an estimation of @xmath30 for @xmath33 to arrive at the adaptive weight @xmath34 .",
    "it is most common to compute the covariance matrix estimate as @xmath35=@xmath36 .",
    "this approach is known as sample matrix inversion ( smi ) .",
    "assuming gaussian - distributed interference , an optimum detection statistic follows from the likelihood ratio test and appears as @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the detection threshold .",
    "the performance of ( [ eq : lrt ] ) is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the probability of false alarm , @xmath41 is the probability of detection , @xmath42 is a normalized detection threshold , @xmath43 is the modified zero - order bessel function of the first kind , and @xmath44 equals the square - root of the peak output sinr . according to ( [ eq : pd ] ) , @xmath41 depends on both output sinr and the value of @xmath40 in a white noise detection scenario .",
    "if the value of @xmath40 is specified , @xmath41 is a monotonic function of @xmath44 .",
    "thus , maximizing sinr likewise maximizes @xmath41 for a fixed value of @xmath40 .",
    "in this section , a novel adaptive reduced - rank scheme based on adaptive basis function approximation ( abfa ) is proposed .",
    "then , we derive the sg and rls algorithms for efficiently implementing the proposed scheme . finally , we compare the computational complexity in terms of multiplications of the proposed scheme and the existing algorithms .",
    "the novel scheme employs the well - known framework of slc structure and consists of selected sets of basis functions that perform dimensionality reduction and an adaptive reduced - rank filter . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : abfa_rr ] , we begin by using a desired target signal @xmath15 ( steering vector ) as a first - stage matched filter to form a main - beam response @xmath45 . in our design , there are @xmath46 sets of basis functions @xmath47 pre - stored as candidate projection matrices , where @xmath48 is the length of reduced - rank filter . based on fig .",

    "we select one matrix from these @xmath46 sets of basis functions as the instantaneous projection matrix by using the decision rule @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",

    "we set the value of @xmath67 in a deterministic way which can be expressed as @xmath68 it should be remarked that other designs have been investigated and this structure has been adopted due to an excellent trade - off between performance and complexity .      here",
    ", we describe the sg and rls algorithms that adjust the parameters of the reduced - rank filter based on the mse and ls cost function .",
    "we present a low - complexity sg adaptive reduced - rank algorithm for efficiently implementing the proposed method .",
    "the reduced - rank mse cost function is given by @xmath69 by computing the instantaneous gradient terms of ( [ eq : cost_function ] ) with respect to @xmath50 and introducing the positive step size @xmath70 , the resulting abfa - sg algorithm is thus given by @xmath71      here , we develop the rls - version of the proposed abfa scheme . to this end , let us first consider the ls design of the proposed scheme as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the forgetting factor . by computing the gradient of ( [ eq : ls_cost ] ) with respect to @xmath50 equal to zero , we obtain @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 denote the time averaged correlation matrix and cross - correlation vector respectively . thus the optimal weight can be calculated recursively using the rls algorithm , which is summarized as follows @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a small",
