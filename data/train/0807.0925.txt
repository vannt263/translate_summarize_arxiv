    "it can be very useful to model and understand market microstructure .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that the number of trades and volume can help explain volatility fluctuations and therefore help model asset returns @xcite .",
    "more importantly , these studies link market activity ( and therefore market microstructure ) to the large class of asset allocation and pricing models based on time changed brownian motion @xcite .",
    "more practically , we also point to the increase of intra - day trading that some claim should account for more than @xmath0 of the trading volume by 2010 .",
    "high - frequency trading will increasingly require market microstructure for risk control and trading .    in this paper , we use the doubly stochastic poisson process to model the number of trades inside of a trading day . using this model ,",
    "we focus on the interaction between noise and the trade rate `` u''-shaped pattern ( higher average arrival rate at the open and close of the trading day ) .",
    "we report an interesting feature of such model : stochastic resonance ( sr ) .",
    "the presence of stochastic resonance indicates that a correct amount of noise is , in fact , beneficial to increase the detection of the `` u''-shaped pattern .",
    "that is , random trading ( represented by random arrival rates ) can constructively contribute to the existence of such periodic patterns .",
    "finance and economics show a variety of well documented periodic patterns @xcite .",
    "in particular , there is the intra - day `` u''-shaped pattern ( or patterns ) .",
    "that is , the average intra - day volatility , the trading volume , bid - ask spreads , trading activity ( number of trades ) , and even returns are significantly higher near the open and close of the trading day @xcite .",
    "these quantities form on average an `` u '' shape ; hence , the name `` u-shaped pattern '' .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that there need not be a official exchange halt .",
    "studies using 24-hour markets ( such as currency markets ) find that `` u''-shaped patterns are also present within the normal business hours @xcite .",
    "there is a large literature that explains the different `` u''-shaped patterns . in general",
    "the literature has been grouped into two lines : the first line suggests that asymmetric information is a necessary condition for the `` u '' shape to exist . by asymmetric information , it is meant that some traders have private information about the future asset returns @xcite or payoffs @xcite . it is the interplay between informed traders and uniformed traders together with market stops that will lead to the observed pattern both in returns and volumes @xcite .",
    "the second line contests the importance of asymmetric information by pointing out to the presence of the same patterns in markets with no asymmetric information @xcite .",
    "they argue that the presence of market stops could be enough .",
    "this line emphasizes the exchange of risk close to market stops @xcite .",
    "the argument is that information accumulated overnight will generate an increase of the trading activity at market open because portfolio managers will want to bring their portfolio to a particular risk target as soon as possible .",
    "the same will happen at the end of a trading day , when traders will want to prepare themselves for the next overnight period .",
    "therefore , the pattern could be just due to the timing of transaction decisions by institutional investors and long - term investors with short term investors representing the other side of the trade @xcite .",
    "in this paper we do not address the micro - economical origin of such patterns as , for instance , in hong and wang @xcite .",
    "we take an empirical approach to the problem .",
    "we start with a plausible statistical model which describes the data well .",
    "since our model presents stochastic resonance , we conjecture that such a phenomenon can be important to the `` u '' pattern .",
    "the presence of sr could indicate that noise traders can , in fact , magnify such pattern .",
    "however , in the present paper we will not be able to reach such level of description , leaving such questions for future studies .    from a practical point of view ,",
    "our work still presents useful results .",
    "for instance , one can also think on a possible algorithm where random trading ( hence undetected to other traders ) can enhance even further such a pattern .",
    "of course , the benefit of enhancing such a pattern is , a priori , not clear .",
    "but in a similar fashion there could be other patterns where similar analysis will lead to undetected ( and beneficial to the trader ) market manipulation .",
    "we also point to the analogy drawn recently by dempster et al .",
    "@xcite as a possible starting point to generalize sr to asset allocation , for instance",
    ".      stochastic resonance ( sr ) has been successfully used to explain signal transmission and detection in a wide variety of systems in diverse areas such as physics , geology , neural science , engineering , and biology @xcite .",
    "sr is briefly defined as noise - enhanced signal detection .",
    "typically there is a threshold below which the signal can not be detected . adding noise to the signal",
    "can increase the number of events that cross such a threshold , hence increasing the detection of such signal .",
    "imagine a sine wave of amplitude less than the detection barrier .",
    "noise added to the sine wave will increase the events that cross the detection barrier .",
    "however , if the noise intensity is too high , it will corrupt the signal beyond recognition .    in finance ,",
    "stochastic resonance has been suggested to explain market crash and high - frequency patterns in the exchange rate @xcite .",
    "different from previous work , our paper employs non - dynamical , threshold - free stochastic resonance @xcite .",
    "non - dynamical sr is purely stochastic in nature and , therefore , it does not require a microscopic model ( such as newton s equations of motion ) .",
    "consequently , it can be more general because it dissociates a specific microscopic model from the sr phenomenon . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time this particular sr class has been applied to financial data .",
    "in direct analogy to non - dynamical sr in other disciplines , we assume that trade arrivals follow a time - dependent poisson process .",
    "we take the point of view of a market participant and observer .",
    "we observe signals in the market that are being transmitted to all market participants .",
    "our goal is to describe the present state of the trading environment and therefore detect the presence of sr .",
    "non - dynamical and threshold - free stochastic resonance was originally discovered for systems that can be modeled with a doubly stochastic poisson process ( or time - dependent poisson process ) @xcite .",
    "such a process is constructed out of poisson process @xmath1 with the probability distribution of @xmath2 events during time interval @xmath3 given by    @xmath4    where the event arrival rate @xmath5 is itself a time dependent random process independent of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "bezrukov and vodyanoy have shown that the following arrival rate @xmath6 of a doubly stochastic poisson process exhibits sr :    @xmath7    with @xmath8 as    @xmath9    that is , @xmath8 is the sum of zero mean gaussian noise @xmath10 with root mean square @xmath11 ; and a weak periodic signal with amplitude @xmath12 and frequency @xmath13 @xcite .    in the case of equation  ( [ vt ] ) , the slow cosine - wave @xmath14 can be better detected , due to sr , by analyzing the final poisson generated time series @xmath1 if there is a correctly tuned noise @xmath10 . however , excessive noise might corrupt the signal .      for a quantitative analysis of the synchronized process , signal - to - noise ratio ( snr )",
    "is introduced to measure stochastic resonance .",
    "snr is defined as the height of the signal divided by the height of the noise background of the power spectrum at the signal frequency @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we speak of sr if there is a maximum in the output snr as a function of noise intensity @xmath11 .",
    "that is , there is an optimal value of the noise that concurs with the periodic signal .",
    "bezrukov and vodyanoy derived the output snr for the doubly stochastic poisson process with the rate given by equation  ( [ rt ] ) and equation  ( [ vt ] ) via power spectral density for @xmath15 and @xmath13 much smaller than all other characteristic frequencies .",
    "the output snr is given by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the noise corner frequency @xcite .",
    "we also have @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the noise @xmath10 correlation time .",
    "the noise has a lorentzian power spectrum with exponential autocorrelation function .",
    "we have also verified equation  ( [ s2n ] ) by monte carlo ( mc ) simulating equation  ( [ poisson ] ) with rate given by equations  ( [ rt ] ) and ( [ vt ] ) @xcite . using our mc simulations",
    ", we remark that equation  ( [ s2n ] ) is still a very good approximation outside the range of parameters for which it has been derived @xcite .",
    "the maximum snr as a function of @xmath11 in equation  ( [ s2n ] ) is the result of a competition between the exponential in the numerator and the exponential times a linear term ( to first order approximation ) in the denominator .",
    "the constant @xmath20 is a general scale of the amplitude of the maximum .",
    "the location of the maximum is given by @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath21 is the number of events that occur over the correlation time . if @xmath21 is large , the maximum moves to small @xmath11 ; if @xmath21 is small the maximum moves to large @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the existence of the maximum depends entirely on @xmath21 : sr is more important for a random variable where the statistics is poor ; that is , the equilibrium arrival rate @xmath22 is small .",
    "sr is also more important when the noise present ( or added ) to the system is uncorrelated .",
    "furthermore , it also shows that no matter how good @xmath22 is , the output signal detection could be further improved if @xmath17 is big enough .",
    "equation  ( [ s2n ] ) shows that if the condition @xmath23 [ @xmath24 holds , the process demonstrates sr .",
    "we can not always perform controlled experiments in economics ; therefore , we need to extract all the needed information from the data we observe .",
    "we first parameterize the time dependent rate @xmath6 defined by equations  ( [ rt ] ) and ( [ vt ] ) without the gaussian noise @xmath10 by assuming that parameters for the rate are constant for at least @xmath25 month .",
    "we have @xmath26 where @xmath13 is one over the trading day , @xmath27 seconds .",
    "notice that once we have detected the periodic signal @xmath28 , we have bypassed one of the potential benefits of sr : increasing statistics to help the signal detection .",
    "therefore , we can not infer if our signal reconstruction was helped by sr .",
    "however , we can still say that a system can potentially present sr by identifying all the parameters .    in our numerical experiments , we obtained tick - by - tick financial data ( smallest time resolution is @xmath25 second ) for @xmath29 trading stocks ( aa , aep , aes , amg , aol , ati , ek , f , jpm , pfe , pg , and s ) during @xmath30 trading days ( january 2001 ) .",
    "first , we analyze the daily pattern by constructing a proxy for the trade arrival rate inside of the @xmath31 hours composing the trading day .",
    "we bin the data in @xmath32-minute ( @xmath33-second ) intervals using @xmath25-second resolution from the first day to the last day ( total of @xmath30 days ) .",
    "we assume that the rate in each of the @xmath32-minute bin is constant .",
    "we remove the first @xmath34 minutes at the beginning of the trading day due to data inaccuracy .",
    "we end up with a total of 192 @xmath32-minute intervals in a day .",
    "we then calculate the arrival rate for every @xmath32 minutes by counting the number of trades in every interval and dividing by @xmath33 seconds ; that is , the average number of trades in each of the @xmath35 bins during @xmath30 days .",
    "this is equivalent to fitting a constant rate poisson process since the maximum likelihood estimate for the rate is simply the average number of events per unit of time .",
    "once we have the empirical daily rate pattern , we fit the daily rate pattern to equation  ( [ ratet ] ) to estimate @xmath22 and @xmath12 .",
    "[ fig : intraday ] shows the arrival rate averaged over @xmath30 days and all @xmath29 stocks . in order to average over all stocks",
    ", we subtract @xmath36 from the natural logarithm of the empirical rate of each stock and then multiple by @xmath37 to obtain @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we are able to recover the parameter independent @xmath39 .",
    "equation  ( [ ratet ] ) is a very simple periodic function and hence the most simple example one can choose .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : intraday ] shows that it gives a good approximation to the empirical daily rate pattern especially for the second half of the day .",
    "the first half is on average systematically higher indicating that a skewed function could be better . nonetheless ,",
    "since @xmath22 measures the vertical shift of the whole curve , the value of @xmath22 will not change very much even if asymmetry is taken into account .",
    "the quality of our approximation will suffice for defining sr .",
    "after @xmath22 and @xmath12 have been estimated , the remaining fluctuation are assumed to be generated from the random process @xmath10 with intensity @xmath11 [ eq .",
    "( [ vt ] ) ] . at this stage",
    ", we only need to find @xmath19 ( or @xmath17 ) [ eq .",
    "( [ s2n ] ) ] to demonstrate the presence of sr for a given stock .",
    "we find @xmath19 indirectly through the autocorrelation function of the number of trades @xmath1 .",
    "notice that @xmath19 measures the characteristic memory of the gaussian noise @xmath10 in equation  ( [ vt ] ) .",
    "however , we can not measure the autocorrelation of @xmath10 since @xmath10 can not be observed from the data directly .",
    "furthermore , we can achieve a 1-second resolution by using the autocorrelation @xmath1 , since @xmath1 is directly observed from the market .",
    "we find the autocorrelation of the number of trades for our model by monte carlo ( mc ) simulating equations ( [ poisson ] ) , ( [ rt ] ) , and ( [ vt ] ) .",
    "we simulate a time series of the number of trades @xmath1 with a band - limited white noise @xmath10 of corner frequency @xmath17 . for every @xmath17 ( or @xmath19 ) there will be a time series of the number of trades .",
    "for every such time series , we have an autocorrelation function .",
    "the correlation time @xmath19 for a given stock is the one which minimizes the mean square error between the simulated autocorrelation and the empirical autocorrelation function .",
    "[ fig : auto ] presents the autocorrelation of the number of trades @xmath1 for two stocks , ati and f. we calculate the autocorrelation function using all @xmath30 days of tick - by - tick data ( a total of @xmath40 data points ) .",
    "these stocks represent the typical autocorrelation for our @xmath29 stocks .",
    "we are able to model autocorrelation function up to correlations of the order of @xmath41 . however , in agreement with the literature , some stocks clearly present a slow decaying autocorrelation .",
    "notice that f has a slow decaying tail above the autocorrelation noise level ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "ati , however , decays faster and has no significant autocorrelation .",
    "the presence of a persistent tail for f shows that the autocorrelation could better modeled either by 2 exponentials ( two different @xmath19 ) or by a power law .",
    "the exponential autocorrelation function with a single @xmath19 is , therefore , a first order approximation .",
    "however , such first order approximation will suffice to define sr .",
    "we note that is highly unlikely that @xmath19 will be small enough for a stock to present a maximum in snr and still have a large and significant autocorrelation tail .",
    "that is , most of the autocorrelation ( @xmath43 ) is generally explained by a single exponential function . if a stock has a large autocorrelation tail , it will have a large @xmath19 as happens with f ( and not with ati ) .",
    "the noise intensity @xmath11 defines the present trading environment in the snr graph [ fig .",
    "( [ fig : snr ] ) ] .",
    "we find @xmath11 by fitting the theoretical probability density function ( pdf ) of the doubly stochastic poisson process to the empirical pdf @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath22 and @xmath12 were estimated previously via equation  ( [ ratet ] ) .",
    "we replace the previously estimated @xmath22 and @xmath12 into equation  ( [ rt ] ) .",
    "we continue with the approximation that every 2-minute interval is described by doubly stochastic poisson process with constant arrival rate @xmath44 perturbed by noise .",
    "thus , within each 2-minute interval , the noise can be described by the log - normal distribution @xmath45 .",
    "we apply numerical integration to calculate the integral of the log - normal ( which defines the random rate ) and the poisson ( which takes this random rate ) to find the pdf of number of arrivals in every 2-minute interval .",
    "since the number of arrivals in 2-minute intervals are small , we compensate the small number of arrivals by fitting all the 2-minute intervals in a trading day at once to obtain @xmath11 by the mean square method .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] shows the daily trading pattern by binning a trading day into @xmath32-minute intervals for f ( other stocks present similar results ) .",
    "the top part of the figure is the daily trading pattern . for a cosine function ,",
    "the first half of the day is the mirror image of the second half .",
    "we put both halves on top of each other .",
    "the solid thick line is obtained from our model . after finding the parameterized mean ,",
    "all the data points are fitted at once to estimate the noise volatility @xmath11 .",
    "the bottom part of the figure shows selected pdfs for few 2-min intervals along the trading day .",
    "for instance , the first pdf represents the first and the last 2-minute intervals of the trading day .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] shows that our simple model with a single @xmath11 can fit the empirical pdf up to @xmath46 orders of magnitude .",
    "this remarkable agreement is found for all stocks studied along the entire trading day .",
    "once @xmath11 is obtained by our scheme , we have described the trading environment using our model ; thus , stocks that present sr can be identified .",
    "[ fig : snr ] shows the snr as a function of noise intensity .",
    "we have normalized all snr curves such that the snr for @xmath47 is equal to @xmath25 for all stocks .",

    "we can see that , in fact , stocks that satisfy @xmath48 such as aep and ati present a maximum on the snr ( and , hence , show sr ) . from our sample of @xmath29 stocks , @xmath49 show sr .",
    "the largest @xmath22 for the stocks that present sr is @xmath50 trades per minute , whereas , theoretically , we need to have @xmath51 per minute ( assuming that @xmath52 sec is the lowest possible value ) .",
    "these results indicate that the less - traded stocks are more likely to present sr .",
    "usually the less - traded stocks are stocks with smaller market capitalization .",
    "therefore , sr should be more important for small cap stocks .",
