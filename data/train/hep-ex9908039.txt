    "were also proposed  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important , as @xmath25  is the least known parameter of the unitarity triangle and is likely to remain the most difficult to determine experimentally .",
    "this paper presents the first observation of the decays @xmath26 and @xmath27 , improved measurements for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 decays , and updated upper limits for @xmath0 decays to @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",

    "the data used in this analysis was collected with the cleo ii and cleo ii.v detectors at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) .",
    "it consists of @xmath30 taken at the @xmath31(4s ) ( on - resonance ) and @xmath32 taken below @xmath1 threshold .",
    "the below - threshold sample is used for continuum background studies .",
    "the on - resonance sample contains 9.66  million @xmath1 pairs .",
    "this is a @xmath33 increase in the number of @xmath1 pairs over the previously presented analysis  @xcite .",
    "cleo ii and cleo ii.v are general purpose solenoidal magnet detectors , described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . in cleo ii , the momenta of charged particles are measured in a tracking system consisting of a 6-layer straw tube chamber , a 10-layer precision drift chamber , and a 51-layer main drift chamber , all operating inside a 1.5 t superconducting solenoid .",
    "the main drift chamber also provides a measurement of the specific ionization loss , @xmath34 , used for particle identification . for cleo ii.v",
    "the 6-layer straw tube chamber was replaced by a 3-layer double - sided silicon vertex detector , and the gas in the main drift chamber was changed from an argon - ethane to a helium - propane mixture .",

    "isolated showers with energies greater than @xmath42  mev in the central region of the csi calorimeter and greater than @xmath43  mev elsewhere , are defined to be photons . to reduce combinatoric backgrounds we require the lateral shapes of the showers to be consistent with those from photons . to suppress further low energy showers from charged particle interactions in the calorimeter we apply a shower energy dependent isolation cut .",
    "pairs of photons with an invariant mass within @xmath44  mev ( @xmath45 ) of the nominal @xmath46 mass are kinematically fitted with the mass constrained to the @xmath46 mass .    charged particles ( @xmath47 ) are identified as kaons or pions using @xmath34 .",
    "electrons are rejected based on @xmath34 and the ratio of the track momentum to the associated shower energy in the csi calorimeter .",
    "we reject muons by requiring that the tracks do not penetrate the steel absorber to a depth greater than seven nuclear interaction lengths .",
    "we have studied the @xmath34  separation between kaons and pions for momenta @xmath48  gev@xmath49  in data using @xmath50-tagged @xmath51 decays ; we find a separation of @xmath52 for cleo ii and @xmath53 for cleo ii.v .",

    "@xcite . in this section",
    "we will briefly describe the basic ideas , as well as the main results of this work .",
    "as pointed out in a recent paper by he , hou , and yang,@xcite a number of cleo measurements of charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays indicate a preferance for @xmath135 .",
    "this conclusion is based on a comparison of the cp - averaged branching fraction measurements with theoretical predictions based on the factorization model . in this section",
    "we report results of a global fit that quantifies the qualitative observation made in ref .",
    "@xcite .    assuming factorization one may express@xcite@xcite the decay amplitudes in terms of ckm matrix elements , form factors , decay constants , quark and meson masses , short distance coefficients , etc . many of these are known to more than adequate precision .",
    "in addition , one may relate many of the poorly known quantities assuming unitarity of the ckm matrix as well as relationships among form factors . as a result ,",
    "only five poorly known parameters are needed to predict cp averaged branching fractions for many of the cleo measurements on charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays .",

    "we add @xmath139 , thus arriving at a @xmath140 degree of freedom fit .",
    "we should note that only 9 of the 14 decay modes are unambiguously observed ( i.e. with statistical significances of more than 4 standard deviations ) .",
    "for the remaining 5 final states we see excess yields above background expectations that have statistical significances ranging from @xmath141 to close to @xmath142 standard deviations .",
    "our choice of decay modes to include was dictated by the following rationale .",
    "we consider for inclusion all decay modes with final states containing two pseudo - scalars , or a pseudo - scalar and a vector meson , for which we have results presented at this conference .",
    "we then exclude final states with @xmath143 and @xmath144 due to the known ambiguities in predicting these decays  @xcite .",
    "we furthermore exclude all final states for which the factorization model makes predictions that are well below the sensitivity of our present data .    minimizing the resulting @xmath137 we find a global minimum of @xmath145 for @xmath39 degrees of freedom .",
    "the parameters at the minimum are :    @xmath146    the central value for @xmath147 corresponds to @xmath148gev@xmath149 of about @xmath150 mev .",
    "the numbers in parentheses are the values for a second local minimum with only marginally larger @xmath137 .",
    "these are the only minima found while repeating the fit @xmath151 times with random starting points across a large volume in the five dimensional parameter space .",
    "figure  [ fig : gamma - chisquare ] shows the dependence of @xmath137 versus @xmath22 .",
    "we refit at each value of @xmath22 to allow the fit to find the global minimum at each fixed value of @xmath22 .",
    "this is important as the correlation matrix for the five free parameters has significant off - diagonal elements .",
    "for example , the two most correlated parameters are @xmath152 and @xmath153 with a correlation coefficient of @xmath154 .",
    "we note that the best fit values for all parameters are closely consistent with theoretical expectations  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "this is either a surprising coincidence or an indication that the model provides an adequate description of nature . if we were to believe the latter than we would have to conclude that we have made a meaningful measurement of @xmath22 , the phase of @xmath134 .",
    "in summary , we have measured branching fractions for all four exclusive @xmath155 decays and made first observations of the decays @xmath156 and @xmath27 . the latter observation completes the full set of @xmath155 measurements .",
    "in addition , we have shown that a global fit to cp - averaged branching fractions measured by cleo allows for a model dependent measurement of @xmath157 degrees .",
