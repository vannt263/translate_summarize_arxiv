    "one of the core questions of stellar coronal physics is what determines the intensity of both local heating of particular coronal structures and the overall heating of the corona taken as a whole . in order to answer this sort of question",
    ", one must look to both the sun and other ( solar - like ) stars : the sun can not tell us how the overall heating rate of a stellar corona depends on the presumed  control parameters \" ( viz . , stellar rotation ) since most of them are fixed , while in the absence of spatially resolved observations , stars can not inform us directly about local heating processes .",
    "this point has motivated us in a series of recent papers to examine how one might go about comparing solar and stellar observations of what is presumably the same process  the  mechanical \" heating of stellar surface layers to produce an x - ray emitting atmosphere ( peres , orlando , reale , rosner , & hudson , 1997 , 2000 , paper ii ; orlando , peres , & reale 2000a ; paper i ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend this work by showing how our detailed understanding of the energetics of individual solar coronal structures can be used to understand the energy budget of solar - like stellar coronae .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the recognition that the x - ray emitting solar corona appears to be entirely formed by plasma magnetically confined in",
    " loops \" ( vaiana et al .  1973 ) , and that while the emission from these loops can fluctuate substantially ( e.g. , sheeley & golub 1979 ; shimizu & tsuneta 1997 ) , this emission is sufficiently steady on the relevant sound crossing and radiative cooling times that simple hydrostatic models suffice to describe them most of the time .",
    "although the phenomenology of these coronal plasma structures seems to be well understood , their heating mechanism remains one of the riddles of coronal physics .",
    "nevertheless , existing spatially resolved observations are able to tell us about the overall energetics of these structures , and to relate it to the ambient magnetic fields ( vaiana & rosner , 1978 ; title & schrijver , 1998 ) . a central role in our present discussion",
    "will be played by the piece - wise integrated emission measure of individual loops ,    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the differential emission measure , defined as    @xmath2    @xmath3 is the plasma density , @xmath4 is a coordinate along the line - of - sight to the coronal source , ( @xmath5 ) is the temperature interval within a given loop over which we integrate the coronal emission , and @xmath6 is the loop temperature maximum .",
    "we shall assume ( with little loss of generality ) that the minimum temperature relevant to x - ray emitting loops ( @xmath7 ) is the same for all quasi - steady loops .",
    "the emission measure has been long known to be a highly useful observationally - constrained quantity for discussing the energetics of stellar atmospheres ( e.g. , athay 1966 , jordan 1980 ) .",
    "what makes the global emission measure especially useful is the fact that the total solar @xmath8 often does not change significantly over time scales of 30 minutes or more ( orlando et al .",
    "2000b ) , with the obvious exception of flares and similar rapidly evolving , large transients .",
    "this observation agrees with the notion that the global emission measure for the coronal x - ray emitting matter , em , is dominated by the steady x - ray emitting loops .",
    "our plan is then as follows : following paper i and paper ii , we will first discuss the emission measure of individual solar coronal loops in the specific context of _ yohkoh _ x - ray images (  ii ) , and show how these individual emission measures can be simply summed by taking advantage of elementary analytical properties of loop emission measures to obtain the overall coronal emission measure . finally , demonstrate how properties of this integrated emission measure can be used to make deductions about the heating of the loop structures themselves (  iii ) .",
    "this lattermost step then allows us to apply our analysis to the spatially unresolved observations of solar - like stellar coronae (  iv ) .",
    "the standard yohkoh data analysis yields pixel maps of temperature and of emission measure from the ratio of two images taken with different filters . from those maps",
    "one derives the global distribution of emission measure versus temperature , em@xmath9 : one divides the temperature range into bins of width @xmath10 , and sums the emission measure of all the pixels belonging to the same temperature bin ( papers i , ii ) .",
    "the em@xmath9 distribution is then the emission measure of the plasma at temperature @xmath11 summed over the temperature range @xmath10 , or ( similar to eq .",
    "1 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is defined as in eq .",
    "( 2 ) ; we shall assume that @xmath11 varies in the range ( @xmath14 ) , where @xmath7 is the minimum temperature of material within loops contributing to x - ray emission , and @xmath15 is the maximum value of all values of the loop maximum temperature @xmath6 , @xmath16 it is worth noting that @xmath13 is a presumably smooth , continuous , function while em@xmath9 is a discretized function in the form of a histogram . in our analysis",
    "we take @xmath17 constant , with 29 bins in the range @xmath18 , the nominal range of yohkoh / sxt , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath20 is small , we approximate @xmath21 , with @xmath22 . in this section , we shall connect the emission measure distribution em@xmath9 to the distribution of emission measures for individual loops .",
    "first , let us turn to the emission measure of individual loops .",
    "we recall from earlier work ( viz . ,",
    "rosner , tucker and vaiana , 1978 , in the following rtv ; maggio and peres 1996 ) that the functional dependence of the emission measure of individual loops , _ em _ , on temperature depends only on the maximum temperature of the given loops , apart from a ( normalizing ) multiplicative factor ; furthermore , we recall that the emission measure of an individual steady loop , em@xmath9 , and the ascending part of the global emission measure , em@xmath9 , of the entire solar corona both obey a simple power law temperature dependence , starting from the minimum temperature ( @xmath7 ) , of the form    @xmath23    in the case of the global emission measure , this was already recognized by athay ( 1966 ; also jordan 1980 , ventura et al .",
    "1998 ) , while jordan  ( 1980 )  studying the very same emission measure  conjectured that em@xmath9 may be interpreted as due to the sum of contributions from many individual loops .",
    "more recently laming , drake and widing ( 1995 ) have derived the whole solar disk using the euv data collected by malinovsky and heroux ( 1973 ) ; the emission measure they derive is fully consistent with the above functional form .",
    "the analysis to follow below shows not only that jordan ( 1980 ) was correct , but that this synthesis procedure can be inverted in order to derive the properties of the underlying contributing loops from the integral ( global ) emission measure .",
    "finally , we note that while the emission measure em@xmath9 of an individual loop terminates at the maximum loop temperature @xmath24 , the global em@xmath9 continues for temperatures beyond that at which its maximum value is attained , with a functional form that also can be approximated by a power law of the form @xmath25 where @xmath3 is typically much larger than @xmath26 .",
    "let us now consider the synthesis of individual loop emission measures . for convenience ,",
    "we write the differential emission measure for a given loop as @xmath27 numerical solutions of the one - dimensional hydrostatic loop equations show that this power law scaling ( with @xmath28 ) holds well except for loops whose length far exceeds their scale height , or for loops with highly non - uniform local heat deposition .",
    "since we shall not concern ourselves with these more complex circumstances ( see below ) , we can use this power law relation to integrate as follows :    @xmath29    since @xmath6 is the maximum loop temperature , we have from the above equation , em@xmath30 . in our specific treatment , em@xmath31 ; thus we find @xmath32 , so that the differential emission measure @xmath1 for a given loop can be expressed in terms of the em@xmath33 ,    @xmath34      as pointed out by many earlier authors , most of the x - ray emission from the solar corona comes from plasma that lies within a ( coronal ) pressure scale height of the surface ; and since most coronal loops appear to have lengths that are equal to , or less than , the pressure scale height corresponding to their maximum temperature , this also means that the bulk of coronal x - ray emission derives from loops with size less than a pressure scale height .",
    "( this is not to say that loops that violate these conditions do not exist : such loops do exist , but we argue that they do not make a significant contribution to the integrated coronal x - ray flux . )    as a consequence , we can take advantage of an extremely useful fact about loops with roughly constant pressure : the one - dimensional equations governing the physics of hydrostatic loops of this type are invariant under changes of the loop field - line spatial scale ( rtv ; maggio & peres 1996 ) , so that  aside from a possible multiplicative constant factor  the functional dependence of the loop emission measure distribution versus temperature , @xmath35 , does not depend on the loop length , but only on the loop maximum temperature @xmath6 .",
    "thus , adding the loop emission measures for two or more loops with the same maximum temperature yields exactly the same functional form versus temperature , apart from the normalization .    with this enormous simplification , we can group all loops of the same maximum temperature @xmath6 together , irrespective of their length ( and plasma pressure ) ; this group may be called a @xmath6-equivalence class of loops ( obviously indexed by the maximum loop temperature for that equivalence class ) .",
    "note that , since the product _ plasma pressure @xmath36 loop length _ determines the coronal temperature ( rtv ) , loops with very different pressure and length may belong to the same @xmath6 equivalence class .",
    "thus , we can use the results of the previous subsection , eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) , to write the emission measure for the entire equivalence class of loops with a given maximum temperature @xmath6 , em(@xmath6 ) , in the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the normalizing factor for the emission measure ( the maximum value , occurring at @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 is always approximately @xmath26 .",
    "we have also written @xmath41 to state explicitly its dependence on both @xmath11 and @xmath42 .",
    "we now model the emission measure of the entire corona as the sum of a multitude of static loops of different maximum temperature .",
    "if we define @xmath43 as the probability that a loop has a maximum temperature @xmath6 , such that @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the total number of loops and emission measure of the loop per unit area , but this would not allow us to disentangle the dependence on pressure ( or length ) from the area .",
    "] , then the emission measure vs. @xmath11 of all the loops of equal maximum temperature @xmath24 , em(@xmath46 ) , is given by @xmath47 i.e. , it too is proportional to @xmath48 up to the temperature maximum ; the corresponding maximum emission measure is thus @xmath49 .",
    "the overall emission measure of the corona is due to the sum of all equivalence classes of @xmath6 loops present in the corona up to the largest coronal temperature , here for simplicity indicated as @xmath50 ; this is simply    @xmath51    thus , the global emission measure at temperature @xmath11 is the sum of the emission measure of all the loops whose maximum temperature @xmath52 . fig .",
    "[ emsum ] shows an idealized example of such a sum for a distribution of loops with different @xmath6 : we hypothesize a simplified coronal loop population made of six different equivalence classes and derive their em(t ) from eq .",
    "[ emsumloop ] .",
    "since the contribution of each @xmath6 loop equivalence class is @xmath53 , the total emission measure distribution is also @xmath53 , up to the lowest value of @xmath6 of all the loop equivalence classes .",
    "this will be proved more precisely in the following .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ emsum ] shows the @xmath54 of the six loop equivalence classes used for this example .",
    "more generally , the shape of the global emission measure distribution is determined by the relative contribution of each equivalence class of loops to the overall emission measure ( drake et al .",
    "for example , while the em@xmath9 distribution of the sun has , typically , only one maximum , the em@xmath9 distribution of very active stars may show two maxima ( e.g. , griffiths & jordan 1998 ) .",
    "we will comment on this point in the last section .",
    "[ em1 ] shows the em@xmath9 derived from a coronal observation made with yohkoh / sxt .",
    "the ascending part of the curve , up to its peak , at the temperature @xmath55 k , is reasonably well approximated by a @xmath48 power law ( cf .",
    "also papers i , ii , and orlando et al .",
    "2000b ) up to the peak value , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 @xmath58 ) .",
    "this power law behavior for the ascending part of the emission measure is present in most phases of the solar cycle ; paper ii and orlando et al .",
    "( 2000b ) show several examples of this behavior .",
    "if one examines the entire set of yohkoh / sxt observations along the solar cycle , one finds that @xmath59 varies only by a small factor , while the amplitude of the emission measure at @xmath60 , @xmath61 , varies by several orders of magnitude ; both these variations are larger at the time of solar maximum .    for @xmath62 , the emission measure declines , and",
    "again closely follows a single power law of the form @xmath63 , with @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "[ em1 ] ) .",
    "this behavior holds for all cases of the quasi - steady solar corona that we have studied , although the power law index @xmath65 varies as the cycle proceeds : @xmath65 is larger ( steeper power law ) near solar minimum ( cf .",
    "paper ii ) .",
    "the close resemblance between the synthetic emission measure distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ emsum ] and the observationally - derived emission measure distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ em1 ] suggests strongly that the observed distribution can indeed be regarded as a result of the superposition of quasi - static loops characterized by a distribution of maximum loop temperatures ; in the following , we will then simply presume that this is indeed the case .",
    "we now show how the contribution of each equivalenced class of loops , e.g. , the unknown expression @xmath66 appearing in eq . ( 12 ) , can be recovered from an analysis of the observed em@xmath9 : in appendix a we show that this expression can be obtained by using eq .",
    "[ emsumloop ] to give @xmath67 now , since @xmath68 we obtain immediately @xmath69 the dashed line in fig .",

    "[ nfq ] also shows the results of an analysis of the em(@xmath11 ) , using eq .",
    "[ nfqeqn ] but taking into account the departure from power laws of the ascending and of the descending parts of em(t ) , and considering the effect of error bars and the inherently non - linear characteristics of the analysis .",
    "we have made a monte - carlo calculation as follows : first for each data point of em(@xmath11 ) we have generated a random value from a gaussian distribution centered on the value itself with @xmath75 given by the error bar ; then applying eq .",
    "[ nfqeqn ] to this new em(t ) distribution we obtain a @xmath76 .",
    "we have thus repeated the monte - carlo calculation 1000 times and determined , for each @xmath42 , the median value ( marked with a diamond ) and the bounds enclosing 68% and 90% of the distribution of @xmath66 values obtained with the simulation .",
    "these two bounds are shown as error bars of different lengths on each point in fig .",
    "the @xmath76 distribution obtained in this way is remarkably close to the results of eq .",
    "[ loop_contrib ] , albeit the latter somehow underestimates the contribution of loops in the descending part , especially hot ( @xmath77 k ) loops , and of loops with @xmath78 k. the results well below @xmath79 k are consistent with no significant contribution from soft x - ray emitting loops , however with large error bars .",
    "for the analytical derivation to follow we will use the piecewise power law description made above , for ease of calculation and because it can help us to gain insight into the results .",
    "also , we will discuss again the limits of our approximations for @xmath73 in the last section .",
    "as an aside , we note ( from eq . ( 11 ) ) that each equivalence class of loops with the same maximum temperature @xmath6 will contribute to the _ total _ emission measure as follows :    @xmath80    where @xmath81 k is the lowest coronal temperature we consider , and since @xmath82 the term containing @xmath7 is negligible .",
    "the fact that em@xmath9 can be expressed as a sum over the emission measure distribution of many independent static ( or quasi - static ) loops has important implications on the heating of these structures .",
    "if @xmath83 is the differential emission measure per unit temperature interval at temperature @xmath11 of a whole class of loops of the same maximum temperature , @xmath6 , and @xmath84 is the radiative loss per unit emission measure , then the total radiative losses are given by @xmath85 since @xmath86 in analogy to what was discussed in  2 , and @xmath87 in the range @xmath88 , with @xmath89 erg s@xmath90 @xmath91 k ( from the mekal spectral model ; mewe , lemen , & van den oord 1986 ; kaastra 1992 ; mewe , kaastra & liedahl 1995 and references therein ) , @xmath92 where we have neglected @xmath93 since @xmath82 .",
    "these radiative losses are approximately one half of the total energy input to the loop , the other half being conducted towards the lower transition region , where it is radiated away ( cf . ,",
    "vesecky , antiochos , & underwood 1979 ) . the total amount of heat delivered within loops with temperature maximum @xmath6 is thus given by @xmath94 therefore , using eq .",

    "the above equation shows that the entire coronal heating budget is approximately proportional to the peak value of the emission measure distribution ( @xmath56 ) , and inversely proportional to the temperature of maximum emission measure ( @xmath59 ) , with a rather mild dependence on the indices of the ascending and descending power laws , @xmath40 and @xmath119 , respectively , which just enter via the factor @xmath120 the value of this factor is approximately 20 for the specific case shown in fig .",

[ eq12 ] .",
    "the total heat deposited in a set of loops characterized by maximum temperature @xmath6 can also be expressed as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the average heating rate per unit volume , assumed uniform inside the loop for simplicity , @xmath125 is the area covered by the two footpoints on the solar ( or stellar ) surface and @xmath126 is the semilength of the loops with @xmath24 as temperature maximum .",

    "this decrease of em(t ) for @xmath163 can be used to derive the distributions both of loops and of their heating as a function of @xmath24 , the loops maximum temperature .",
    "finally , we show ( on the basis of eq .",
    "[ loop_contrib ] ) that there are relatively few loops with maximum temperature well below @xmath59 ; indeed , we show that the distribution of emitting loops , derived on the basis of eq .",
    "[ loop_contrib ] , and the temperature dependence of the heating rate ( eq . [ heat_budget ] ) are rather sharp functions of @xmath6 . an important ( as yet unresolved ) issue to what extent this sharp temperature dependence is real , rather than depending on ( either ) a somewhat too idealized model or the unavoidably limited instrumental capabilities of yohkoh / sxt ( in particular , its spectral resolution ) .",
    "observations using euv spectroscopic data ( e.g. , brosius et al .",
    "1996 ) show rather similar emission measure distributions , suggesting that the steep rise of the loop distribution is very likely real ; nevertheless , it seems extraordinary that there are very few quasi - steady loops with @xmath164 k. in any case , it appears reasonable that the contribution of quasi - steady loops with maximum temperature below 1 or 2 million degrees to em(@xmath11 ) is indeed very small relative to the hotter corona , albeit not exactly zero , at the maximum of the solar cycle .",
    "the largest contribution to the coronal emission measure , to the coronal radiative losses and to the coronal heating is due to loops with maximum temperature around the peak of em@xmath9 .",
    "the steep decrease of the solar em@xmath9 beyond the temperature of maximum em@xmath9 implies that loops are fewer and fewer for higher and higher @xmath6 , and that less and less total heat is delivered in the hotter loops .",
    "this peak evolves as a function of the solar cycle : from eq .",
    "[ loop_contrib ] , eq .",
    "[ heat_budget ] , and from the evolution of em@xmath9 during the solar cycle ( paper ii ; orlando et al .",
    "2000b ) we can infer the evolution of the emitting loop distribution and of the related heating distribution .",
    "observations show that both distributions become more concentrated at lower temperatures , and that their maximum value gets smaller during the minimum of the solar cycle ; we also know that the ascending , low temperature , portion of em@xmath9 becomes slightly steeper during the solar minimum .",
    "the steepening during the minimum of the cycle may be due to several causes , including the low yohkoh / sxt sensitivity to cooler plasma or ( more likely ) to the fact that most of the corona is devoid of loops and thus consist mostly of non - confined plasma . in spite of this , @xmath59 varies only between @xmath165 k and @xmath166 k during the solar cycle .    on the other hand em(@xmath11 ) , @xmath59 and , therefore , the distribution of loop emission measure and heating versus @xmath6 all appear to be subject to negligible ( if any ) changes on time scales of hours or  sometimes  days ( away from flares ) . the steadiness of em@xmath9 , and therefore of the distributions of the loops and of the heating , over a few hours ( orlando et al .",
    "2000b ) seems to imply an analogous steadiness of the heating budget of the entire confined solar corona , with only slow and gradual changes .",
    "it is not clear why this is so .",
    "one possibility is that this observational characteristic is just a consequence of summing randomly distributed contributions over the entire corona , so that it just reflects the effects of statistical temporal smoothing rather than true steadiness of the entire corona .",
    "another possibility is that the global externally supplied energy budget of the corona is actually steady .",
    "either possibility would have major implications for the heating process of the corona .",
    "finally , we note that it is straightforward to see from eq .",
    "[ nfqeqn ] that any flattening , or even increase , at a given temperature @xmath167 of the emission measure em@xmath9 along its descending portion would provide evidence for another preeminent set of loops , and related heating , with @xmath168 .",
    "in particular , a doubly - peaked em(@xmath11 ) ( as the one found , for instance , by griffith & jordan 1998 ) implies a doubly peaked loop distribution . in the light of our results ,",
    "the findings of griffiths & jordan ( 1998 ) are indicative of two distinct distributions of steady loops peaking at two rather different temperatures , one at several @xmath79 k and the other at a few @xmath152 k. alternatively , it may be that steady coronal emission is accompanied in some ( very active ) stars by a relatively large number of simultanteous flares whose light curves overlap in such a way that they mask much  if not all  of the variability ( e.g. , giampapa et al .  1996 ;",
    "paper ii ) ; see reale et al.(2000 ) and peres ( 2000 ) .",
    "our method allows us  in principle  to infer the global distribution of the heating versus the loop maximum temperature ; this information can , in turn , provide constraints on the heating mechanism of the corona and on the global coronal energy budget . on the practical level ,",
    "however , it is far from easy to derive a relationship between the loops average volumetric heating rate and the loop temperature as one needs to know the fraction of the solar surface covered by the footpoints of the loops with given maximum temperature @xmath6 .    as for future applications",
    ", we plan to apply extensively the diagnostics presented here to the em@xmath9 of the whole solar corona at several points during the solar cycle , using the large data set collected with yohkoh / sxt .",
    "it is also possible to apply the diagnostics to selected portions of the corona , e.g. , yohkoh / sxt data on single active regions , or to serts observations ( brosius et al .",
    "the diagnostics can also be modified very easily for application to the diffential emission measure distribution , rather than to the piecewise - integrated emission measure treated here .",
    "for obvious reasons , our analysis is well suited to stellar observations since it uses a global coronal characteristics , em(@xmath11 ) , readily obtained by a spectroscopic coronal observation .",
    "we foresee an immediate application to euve stellar observations ( drake et al .",
    "2000 ) ; and we also plan to apply it to data obtained from the spectroscopic x - ray instruments onboard the chandra and xmm - newton x - ray astronomy missions .",
    "it will be particularly instructive to compare the results for stars of different activity levels with the analogous solar results .",
    "we acknowledge useful suggestions and comments from s. serio and e. franciosini , and useful discussions with c. kankelborg .",
    "we also acknowledge useful suggestions from an anonymous referee . this work has been partially supported by the agenzia spaziale italiana and by the italian ministero delluniversit e della ricerca scientifica e tecnologica .",
    "our task is to derive @xmath66 from the observed em@xmath9 . on the basis of eq .",
    "( 12 ) ,    @xmath169    @xmath170    @xmath171    since the last term is      and therefore    @xmath173    this expression connects the distribution function of loop maximum temperatures to the global emission measure distribution . in the specific case of a @xmath174 power law , we obtain instead of eq.[eq_app1 ]    @xmath175",
    "in this appendix , we evaluate the heating budget of loops with @xmath24 in the range of @xmath177k , using a few simple assumptions ; our aim is to provide the reader with a feeling of the orders of magnitude involved .    as a first simplification ,",
    "we note that since loops with @xmath148k largely dominate the emission measure distribution , their total emission measure @xmath178 is comparable to the maximum value of @xmath107 and therefore we shall assume @xmath179 @xmath58 .",
    "the emission measure in an equivalence class of loops with maximum temperature @xmath6 ( all with the same length @xmath134 and , therefore , pressure @xmath130 ) can then be approximated as @xmath180 ; @xmath181 is the proton number density , v is the loops total volume , and @xmath182 is the boltzmann constant ; according to the rtv loop scaling laws , @xmath183 , and therefore @xmath184 , where @xmath185 .",
    "thus , upon substitution , we find that the emission measure is given by the expression @xmath186 and @xmath187 .    however , loops with the same temperature may have different , even very different , lengths .",
    "let us consider , then , for simplicity just two values of @xmath134 , @xmath188 cm and @xmath189 cm , the first representative of active regions loops , the other of more quiet and extended loops but still shorter than the pressure scale height ; their total emission measure is @xmath190 and their total volume is @xmath191 ( where , from here on , all quantities with suffixes 1 and 2 pertain to , respectively , the first and the second set of loops ) . then if we assume that @xmath192 , and since @xmath193 , we are led to the result @xmath194 .",
    "if we insert numerical values for the various known quantities , we then obtain @xmath195 @xmath196 .",
    "furthermore we may assume that loops have an aspect ratio @xmath197 ( a typical value of most loops observed ) where r is the cross - sectional radius of the loop .",
    "the volume of each loop is then @xmath198 . on the basis of these considerations we would then have @xmath199 loops for the first set and @xmath200 for the second , such that @xmath201 loops and @xmath202 loops .    under the same assumptions , the sum in eq .",
    "( 38 ) can be re - written in the form @xmath203 so that the contribution of all loops with the same length within the @xmath6 equivalence class would amount to @xmath204 .",
    "thus , for the first of loops considered above , @xmath205 and @xmath206 . evidently under these assumptions",
    "the set 1 of loops , i.e. , those with @xmath207 cm , have a significantly larger sum , and therefore dominate the heating budget of the @xmath6 equivalence class .",
