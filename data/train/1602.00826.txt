    "in a recent paper @xcite we used a well - known model of fluctuations @xcite in buu @xcite to generate event by event simulation of collisions of fairly large ( 120 on 120 ) ions as well as not so large ( 40 on 40 ) ions .",
    "the multiplicity distribution of final products of collision showed a remarkable similarity with the results given by equilibrium statistical models where we used a canonical thermodynamic model ( ctm ) @xcite .",
    "both canonical @xcite and grand canonical thermodynamic models @xcite predict first order phase transitions in hot nuclear systems .",
    "so the similarity suggested that probably transport model calculations also will give more direct evidence of first order phase transition .",
    "this work is aimed at exploring this further .",
    "it is not so obvious how to go about doing this . in canonical and grand canonical models",
    "there are two parameters , temperature @xmath2 ( which is the basic parameter ) and average energy @xmath3 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath3 against @xmath2 can indicate the order of phase transition . usually two parameters are needed but in transport model calculations that we do here",
    "there is only one parameter , the beam energy @xmath3 .",
    "defining a temperature is quite difficult .",
    "formulae like @xmath4 are obviously inappropriate .",
    "one might try @xmath5 but that requires obtaining the entropy of an interacting system and an accurate evaluation would be very hard .",
    "we recall that as early as in 1998 , compiling existing knowledge from experimental data and comparing these with lattice gas model predictions , it was concluded that in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions one passes through a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "this was subsequently investigated by many authors with different approaches .",
    "one approach uses the idea of `` bimodality '' a very useful exposition of this can be found in @xcite which also has a list of other references using `` bimodality '' approach .",
    "the size of the largest cluster @xmath1 is considered to be an order parameter .",
    "phase transitions occur in very large systems but practical calculations ( and experiments with heavy ions ) need to be done with finite systems .",
    "gulminelli and chomaz point out that we should expect for @xmath0 ( probability that the biggest cluster has mass @xmath1 ) a double humped distribution ( hence the name bimodality ) if the phase transition is first order .",
    "the authors establish this with a lattice gas model .",
    "for relevant study of this in ising model , see @xcite bimodality also emerges in ctm which has a first order phase transition .",
    "this was studied in @xcite and we will have occasion to return to bimodality in ctm later .",
    "the objective of this work is to investigate if bimodality emerges from a transport model calculation . using what is labelled as qmd ( quantum molecular dynamics )",
    ", lefevre and aichelin have used ideas from bimodality to show that in some non - central collisions @xcite there is evidence of first order phase transition @xcite . in the calculation",
    "the full distribution @xmath0 was not displayed .",
    "the complete curves @xmath0 as a function of beam energy is quite interesting and we present them here .",
    "in contrast with the qmd work we use central collisions . as we are interested in phase transition under the influence of nuclear force , coulomb effects will be switched off .",
    "the use of central collisions to display bimodality has been questioned before .",
    "also the transport model we use is quite different from qmd .",
    "the calculations done here follow those of @xcite except for small but important details which will be fully presented .",
    "for completeness we outline the model .",
    "more details are given in @xcite .",
    "the original model was developed in @xcite where the formal structure was discussed and an application was presented .",
    "initially each nucleon in the target and the projectile is given a semi - classical phase space density .",
    "for each nucleon this phase space density is represented by @xmath6 test particles where each test particle is generated by monte - carlo and has a position @xmath7 and a momentum @xmath8 .",
    "initially the two nuclei are apart with an impact parameter @xmath9 ( in this work we only consider central collision @xmath9=0 ) and the projectile starts with a beam velocity towards the target .",
    "as they propagate in time , the test particles will move in a mean field and suffer hard scattering .",
    "as @xmath6 test particles will represent a nucleon the collision cross - section between test particles is reduced to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is nucleon - nucleon cross - section . in @xcite , to simulate an event , the cross - section is further reduced by a factor @xmath6 but if a collision happens not only the the two test particles go from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and from @xmath14 to @xmath15 but @xmath16 test particles contiguous to test particle 1 undergo momentum change @xmath17 and @xmath16 test particles contiguous to test particle 2 undergo momentum change @xmath18 .",
    "this is followed in time till the collisions are over and we have one event . to simulate another event we start with initial positions of the ions and generate by monte - carlo fresh sets of test particles .",
    "many events are needed before any comparison with experiments can be made .",
    "the calculation for each event is quite large as collisions between @xmath19 test particles need to be checked .",
    "here @xmath20 is the number of nucleons in the projectile and @xmath21 is the number of nucleons in the target and @xmath6 is rather large ( usually about 100 ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the problem can be reduced , for each event , to checking collisions between just @xmath22 test particles .",
    "this feature makes it possible for us to do large systems .",
    "we refer to section ii of @xcite for details .",
    "no compromise to theory or numerical accuracy is introduced .     on @xmath23 reaction at beam energies ( a)20 mev / nucleon , ( b)42.5 mev / nucleon and ( c)100 mev / nucleon .",
    "the average value of 2 mass units are shown . at each energy",
    "1000 events are chosen .",
    "the results shown in this figure are calculated at @xmath24=300 @xmath25,width=188 ]    [ bimodality_smaller_system ]",
    "for completeness , we provide some details of the calculation that will be needed to explain our cluster recognition algorithm .",
    "collisions are treated as in @xcite for vlasov propagation we use the lattice hamiltonian method @xcite which accurately conserves energy and momentum . the mean field is also taken from @xcite .",
    "the configuration space is divided into cubic lattices .",
    "the lattice points are @xmath26 fm apart .",
    "thus the configuration space is discretized into boxes of size @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "density at the lattice point @xmath29 is given by @xmath30     on @xmath31 reaction at beam energies ( a)20 mev / nucleon , ( b)60.125 mev / nucleon and ( c)100 mev / nucleon . the average value of 5 mass units are shown . at each energy",

    "1000 events are chosen .",
    "the results shown in this figure are calculated at @xmath24=300 @xmath25 ]    [ bimodality_near_transition ]    here the sum over @xmath33 goes over all the test particles and the form factor is @xmath34 where @xmath35 in this work we have used @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath38 . because of this choice , at a given time , if two test particles are more than 2 @xmath38 apart , they can not affect each other s motion directly .",
    "this prompts us to prescribe the following algorithm .",
    "two test particles are part of the same cluster if the distance between them is less than or equal to 2 @xmath38 .",
    "two clusters are distinct if none of the test particles of cluster 1 is within a distance of 2 @xmath38 from any of the test particles of cluster 2 . with this prescription , the number of clusters and their sizes will change as a function of time at early times . because of momenta that test particles carry , two test particles which were less than 2 @xmath38 apart ( or more than 2 @xmath38 apart ) may not remain so at a later time .",
    "the physical picture we depend upon is that two heavy ions collide , clusters are formed which begin to move away from one another . if this is true then at large times , the momentum @xmath39 and position @xmath40 in each individual cluster are strongly correlated and transfer of test particles between different clusters will disappear .",
    "one can test this by plotting the multiplicity distribution as a function of time .",
    "we find that for 40 on 40 near constancy is observed around 300 @xmath25 and for 120 on 120 ( because this is a much larger system ) around 600 @xmath25 . from the multiplicity distributions of 1000 events , we construct @xmath0 , the probability that the largest cluster in an event has @xmath1 nucleons .",
    "examples are shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "our algorithm for enumerating cluster numbers and their sizes has some similarities and also some differences with the method used in @xcite in qmd .     on @xmath23 reaction on the projectile beam energy per nucleon .",
    "+ lower panel : dependence of first order derivatives of kinetic energy and potential energy with respect to total energy on total enrgy per nucleon for @xmath41 on @xmath23 reaction.,width=226 ]    [ energy_smaller_system ]",
    "in order to study bimodality from our event generation model ( buu plus fluctuation ) we simulate central collisions of mass @xmath42 on mass @xmath42 and mass @xmath43 on mass @xmath43 at different projectile beam energies .",
    "for @xmath42 on @xmath42 reaction the largest cluster probability distribution is plotted in fig . 1 for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 mev / nucleon .",
    "at each energy @xmath47 events are taken and for each event calculation is done up to @xmath48 fm / c .",
    "the results shown are averages for graphs of 2 consecutive mass number at @xmath24=300 fm / c . at projectile beam energy ( @xmath49)=20 mev / nucleon , the @xmath0",
    "is peaked at around mass 60 which represents liquid phase where as at @xmath49=100 mev / nucleon , the probability distribution peaks at very low mass i.e. it suggests the system is in the gas phase . in between these two extremes , at @xmath49=42.5 mev / nucleon the largest cluster probability distribution shows the bimodal behaviour where the height of the two peaks are almost same .",
    "2 shows similar features for for much heavier system : 120 on 120 . here",
    "we take the results at 600 @xmath25 .",
    "several points are worth mentioning .",
    "whether in the case of 40 on 40 or 120 on 120 bimodality occurs in a very narrow range of energy . for 40 on 40",
    "we demonstrate that in fig.3 .",
    "thus to locate bimodality in experiments beam energy variation has to be done in small energy steps .",
    "the narrow width of energy over which bimodality appears is common in ctm also . + a phase transition like",
    "behaviour emerges more directly from our calculations .",
    "this is quite revealing . for 40 on 40 ( and 120 on 120 )",
    "we do our calculation as a function of beam energy . for example for 40 on 40 we did our calculation from beam energy 20 mev / nucleon to 100 mev / nucleon . for each beam energy",
    "1000 events were generated . from these events",
    "we compute the average total energy @xmath50 , the average kinetic energy @xmath51 and the average potential energy @xmath52 per particle .",
    "let us plot the total energy @xmath50 in the cm .",
    "this will of course increase in value as @xmath49 ( mev / nucleon ) increases .",
    "this energy @xmath50 is the sum of kinetic energy @xmath51 and potential energy @xmath52 .",
    "the origin of @xmath51 is more complicated .",
    "it arises from fermi motion of the test particles and also the cm kinetic energy of each cluster .",
    "the quantity @xmath52 is more straightforward .",
    "it arises from the potential energy of the clusters .",
    "an insight is obtained by examining the derivative @xmath53 .",
    "a sudden change in the derivative @xmath53 occurs at the point where bimodality is observed .",
    "this type break in the first derivative is typical of first order phase transitions .",
    "we might consider this break to be an additional signature of a first order phase transition .",
    "+ since here we plotted values for the average of many events , it is natural to ask : could it not be seen in standard buu which does give average values .",
    "this is not obviously so as the average might depend also on the details of fluctuations that were used in our event generation model .",
    "however straightforward buu as has been used before @xcite does produce similar result ( fig.6 ) .",
    "thus the possibility exists that one might get signature for first order phse transition from buu itself .",
    "on @xmath31 instead of @xmath42 on @xmath42.,width=226 ]    [ energy_larger_system ]",
    "we have done central collisions of 40 on 40 and 120 on 120 to test appearance of bimodality which is considered to be a signature of first order phase transition in finite systems .",
    "bimodality was observed . since calculations were done with fixed beam energy one",
    "might be tempted to call it a microcanonical calculation .",
    "but even in central collisions at least two different reaction mechanisms operate .",
    "one is collision between peripheral parts . here",
    "some nucleons may simply pass by or at most make one collision .",
    "we would include pre - equilibrium emission in this category .",
    "the number of nucleons in pre - equilibrium emission and the energy they carry off will vary from event to event .",
    "thus the number of nucleons which suffer multiple collisions and the energy that is available for such multiple collisions event will vary .",
    "presumably such multiple collision events can show signatures statistical equilibrium , phase transitions etc but in experiments and in transport model calculations such as this one all different reaction mechanisms will play a role .",
    "nonetheless , this calculation shows that with just nuclear forces first order phase transition is possible in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "+          the closeness of ctm results and transport model results might be exploited to estimate the freeze - out density in statistical models . in ctm a freeze - out density is assumed but there is no such parameter in transport model . in ctm the temperature at which bimodality appears depends on the assumed freeze - out density .",
    "there will be a freeze - out density at which ctm gives the same bimodality temperature as the transport model",
    ". this could be an estimate for freeze - out density .",
    "detailed calculations have not been carried out .",
