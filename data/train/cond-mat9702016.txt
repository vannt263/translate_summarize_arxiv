    "the study of strongly correlated electronic systems in two dimensions ( 2d ) has been very active , particularly since the discovery of the high @xmath5 superconductors .",
    "however , while there have been great improvements in the reliability and scope of experimental measurements , this has not led to agreement as to the correct description of either high temperature superconductivity , in particular , or two  dimensional correlated systems , in general .",
    "quite the opposite is in fact apparent  certain experimental results are consistent with one phenomenology , but not all experiments seem to support the same physical concepts , and as of yet no one theory is capable of explaining all the data .",
    "one avenue that may alleviate this confusion and allow for a consensus to develop follows from the study of _ ideal experimental systems_. by this we imply certain compounds are amenable , for various physical as well as circumstantial reasons , to a complete characterization .",
    "further , these compounds are such that a relatively simple theoretical model , believed to be appropriate for that material , can be defined , and with suitable ingenuity we can expect to carry out a fully quantitative comparison of this model and the experimental data .    a potential paradigm of 2d antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulators , a category which includes the parent compounds of high t@xmath6 superconductors , is the @xmath1 compound @xcite .",
    "the features that make this compound ideal are : ( i ) it remains tetragonal down to 10 k ; ( ii ) it has an extremely weak coupling between @xmath7 planes , and is thus a more exaggerated quasi2d system than most high @xmath5 systems ; and ( iii ) this material seems to be extremely difficult to dope away from half filling using normal preparation techniques ( a summary of this behaviour may be found in ref .",
    "further , at present our experimental understanding of this material is nearly complete .",
    "its structure has been determined by x  ray and neutron diffraction@xcite to be body  centered ",
    "tetragonal ( @xmath8 type ) , and no transition to the orthorhombic phase is observed down to at least 10 k. this compound has a three  dimensional afm structure and a nel temperature @xmath9 k. in fact , this compound is considered to be the best available experimental realization of the @xmath10 2d square lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet ( 2dslha ) @xcite , with nearest neighbour exchange @xmath11 mev .",
    "lastly , resistivity measurements show that it is strongly insulating @xcite .",
    "the ( essentially ) undopable character of this compound makes it an ideal candidate for angle  resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments .",
    "such studies allow for the measurement of the spectral function @xmath12 ( simply abbreviated as @xmath2 from now on ) of a _ single hole _",
    "( left behind by the creation of a photoelectron ) propagating in a @xmath7 plane , and such data has recently become available @xcite .",
    "the results from this experiment thus provide an ideal testing ground for theories that purport to mimic the low  energy physics of @xmath7 planes ; _",
    "e.g. _ , the most common model , the so  called @xmath0 model , describes spinless vacancies hopping between neighbouring sites in a @xmath10 2dslha .",
    "if this model is indeed a good representation of a single carrier moving in this plane , it should reproduce the _ full spectral functions _ measured in ref .",
    "the point of this paper is to demonstrate how well such models of carrier motion in strongly correlated systems represent the spectral properties via a comparison with the full , measured spectral functions of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the arpes results of ref . @xcite have been the subject of intense theoretical studies .",
    "for example , it has been noted that the single  hole @xmath0 model can not reproduce the experimental band structure everywhere in the brillouin zone , particularly along the @xmath13 to @xmath14 , and the @xmath14 to @xmath15 directions @xcite .",
    "instead , at the very least hoppings beyond near ",
    "neighbour must be added to the @xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "the recognition of the importance of further hoppings has also been obtained in a spin  density wave treatment of the one  band hubbard model @xcite .",
    "work on the more physically plausible three  band model has shown that this model is superior in reproducing the experimental band structure in all regions of the first brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "however , 3band models may be unnecessarily complicated , and thus efforts to find a useful and quantitatively accurate one  band model are warranted .",
    "the above comparisons were based on theoretically determined and experimentally inferred dispersion relations .",
    "of course , experimentally much more information is available , namely , the entire spectral function is known at many wave vectors .",
    "further , it would be best if the comparison of theory and experiment was based on exact theoretical results .",
    "this is not possible unless one treats the strong coupling hamiltonians numerically .",
    "recently we have completed the first exact diagonalization study on a 32site square lattice for the @xmath0 model @xcite , a formidable task ( computationally speaking ) .",
    "this achievement is significant because exact diagonalization results obtained with the smaller @xmath16 fully square cluster are subject to the oddity that this lattice is equivalent to the four  dimensional hypercube ( in the absence of interactions longer than nearest neighbour ) .",
    "other exact results have been obtained on smaller , non  square clusters , or on clusters that lack important wave vectors ( namely , those along the afm brillouin zone boundary ) ; a summary of many of these results is contained in a recent review @xcite . and",
    "lastly and perhaps most importantly , while analytical work based on the self  consistent born approximation for the @xmath0 model has been shown to be very reliable , at least as far as the dispersion relations are concerned @xcite , so far no analogous demonstration of the accuracy of this approach to include further  than",
    " nearest  neighbour hoppings of the @xmath0 model has been published .",
    "thus , we consider our numerical , unbiased , 32site exact diagonalization approach to a precise manner in which these models can be compared to experiment .    in the present paper",
    "we continue our numerical studies on the 32site square lattice , and present a comparison of the full spectral functions for the so  called @xmath17 model , a generalization of the simpler @xmath0 model that includes further hopping processes , as well as three  site , spin ",
    "dependent hopping .",
    "various groups have claimed that this model accurately fits the dispersion relations found in the afm insulator @xmath1 , and such claims are something that we can critique with our numerical results . here , besides continuing these comparisons with our numerical work , we propose an energy dependence of the self  energy for the propagating spin polarons .",
    "angle  resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) has proven to be an invaluable experimental tool for the understanding of the electronic structure of the cuprate superconductors and related correlated  electron materials .",
    "the analysis of the arpes results depends on the emission process being primarily direct transitions so that the spectra reflect the spectral function @xmath18 .",
    "this has allowed for the extensive use of arpes to determine energy versus * k * relations for the highest energy band in the cuprates , and particularly for determining the fermi surfaces of the metals .",
    "most comparisons between calculations and experiment have been performed by extracting a quasiparticle energy at each * k * from both the experimental spectra and the calculated @xmath19 and comparing the dispersions thus derived . however , since both experiment and theoretical calculations represent the spectral function , it should be more instructive to compare the two directly rather than just comparing the derived dispersions .",
    "a direct comparison of spectral functions has its own difficulties , as are outlined below , but hopefully will allow a more complete evaluation of the spectral function derived from the green s function and thus avoid the possible errors involved in determining the experimental quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "for two  dimensional materials such as the cuprates , the inherent lineshape of the arpes spectrum may reveal information about the nature of the elementary excitations .",
    "many previous arpes studies have examined the lineshape of the spectral functions .",
    "( for a review of this subject , see ref .",
    "@xcite ; for particularly relevant experimental work , see @xcite . ) in these studies the assumption is made that direct transitions dominate the spectral intensity , and thus one may model the spectral response with a single peak , and it has been proposed that the nature of this peak should be characteristic of a fermi liquid , a marginal fermi liquid , or some other microscopic model . since these fits have all been to a single peak they represent only the coherent part of the spectrum .",
    "most numerical calculations of @xmath19 for the cuprates indicate that there is a great deal of spectral weight in the incoherent parts of the excitations .",
    "therefore , attempting to fit the cuprate arpes spectra with a single peak of any shape is inherently flawed . in this work",
    "we make no attempt to deduce a specific lineshape , or broadening function , but merely use a few simple fitting procedures as discussed below .",
    "the essential point is that for the purposes of fitting the experimental data , a correct form for @xmath19 is more important than the detailed lineshape of a single peak .",
    "the planar copper oxides are well suited for analysis since in most of these materials there is a single highest energy occupied state ( band ) which is well separated in energy from any other bands .",
    "experimentally , @xmath1 has some particular advantages for the present study in addition to those mentioned above .",
    "it is easy to prepare good surfaces for photoemission since the material cleaves in a manner similar to mica .",
    "in addition , the fact that the oxygen content is fixed to the stoichiometric value gives us confidence that the actual surface under study truly represents a cuo@xmath20 plane with a single hole per copper site .",
    "thus , while the lineshape and broadening appropriate for a particular peak in @xmath2 may be more difficult to determine than for the conducting cuprates , it should be more straight forward to determine the correct greens function for comparison .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , in   [ expt ] we discuss the extraction of the lineshapes of the spin ",
    "polaron band from the arpes data .",
    "then , in   [ theory ] we discuss the various modifications to the @xmath0 model necessary to improve the success of this model in explaining the arpes results . in   [ comparison ]",
    "we present our numerical results and the comparison of our work to the experimental spectral functions ; conclusions are provided in   [ concl ] .",
    "the collection of the relevant data has already been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in that paper the manner in which the quasiparticle dispersion relation was obtained from the arpes data was presented . here",
    "we focus on the quasiparticle lineshapes .",
    "we propose that the experimental data corresponds to such a direct  transition  dominated @xmath2 , plus a background which influences the low energy part of the data and gives rise to an artificially anisotropic peak shape .",
    "we need to subtract off this background from the experimental data before they can be compared to the theoretical @xmath2 .",
    "we have little theoretical guidance for the background function , but we find that a single gaussian peak plus a constant fits the low energy tail of the experimental data very well . in principle , the background can also include a function linear in @xmath22 to account for inelastic scattering , and such a linear function should be * k*independent . however , the best fit at every * k * gives different linear functions . since this term is quite small in all cases , we have chosen to simply set it to be zero . since this background function describes the low energy valence band , we allow it to be * k*dependent .",
    "we determine this background function at each * k * by least ",
    "square fitting , and subtract it off from the experimental data .",
    "the corrected spectra have the following characteristics : ( i ) the peaks broaden and weaken as * k * moves away from the valence band maximum ( vbm ) at @xmath23 , ( ii ) the peaks at their sharpest are broad and asymmetrical , and ( iii ) although the quasiparticle dispersion is flat along the @xmath13 to @xmath14 direction , the spectral weight is a maximum at @xmath24 .    as an example of the application of this procedure , in fig .",
    "[ extraction ] we show the arpes intensities and the background function that we have employed to obtain the quasiparticle @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "clearly , the peak arising from the main valence band is very well represented , even without the inclusion of the inelastic linear term  similar satisfactory agreement is found at other wave vectors .",
    "thus , we hope that by following this prescription we are comparing our theoretical work to the intrinsic spectral response of a single hole propagating in a cuo@xmath20 plane in @xmath1 .",
    "to study the theoretical spectrum @xmath2 of the planar copper oxides , we start with the simple @xmath0 model with hamiltonian , @xmath27 where @xmath28 means nearest neighbours @xcite .",
    "it is well known that this simple , one  band model can not reproduce all the features of the single hole dispersion relation @xmath29 of @xmath1 as measured by arpes @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath29 from the @xmath0 model agrees with experiment along the @xmath13 to @xmath30 direction , two discrepancies remain : ( i ) along the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone ( abz ) edge ( @xmath14 to @xmath15 ) , the @xmath0 model is less dispersive ; and ( ii ) along the @xmath13 to @xmath14 direction , the model is much more dispersive than the experimental result .",
    "various modifications to the @xmath0 model have been suggested to make the theoretical prediction in better agreement with experiment .",
    "one suggestion follows from the finding that a three  band model works much better than the one  band model @xcite , _ viz .",
    "_ one can mimic many features of the three  band model in the one  band model by including farther  than  nearest  neighbour hopping terms .",
    "for example , it has become customary to include @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the second and third  nearest neighbours , respectively .",
    "inclusion of @xmath34 significantly lowers the anisotropy of the effective mass tensor found in the theoretical @xmath29 around @xmath23 @xcite , but discrepancy ( ii ) above still remains .",
    "however , recently it has been suggested that so  called three ",
    "site , spin ",
    "dependent hopping terms @xcite will make the theoretical @xmath29 from @xmath13 to @xmath14 almost dispersionless @xcite , thus eliminating this problem .",
    "these processes are given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the unit vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we have investigated the effects of these terms ( @xmath34 and @xmath40 ) on @xmath29 of the @xmath0 model using the same method as in ref .",
    "in particular , we calculate the quasiparticle dispersion relation @xmath29 and quasiparticle weight @xmath41 of these models for a 32site square lattice .",
    "the parameters we employed are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , and our results are tabulated in table [ zq ] .",
    "( note that @xmath29 as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite is relative to the undoped ground state energy . )",
    "as pointed out before @xcite , the behavior of @xmath41 of the @xmath0 model along the abz edge ( from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ) does not agree with experiment .",
    "arpes data shows that the peak intensity is the largest at @xmath23 , whereas @xmath41 for this wave vector for the @xmath0 is the smallest along this direction . from table",
    "[ zq ] it is clear that inclusion of farther  than ",
    "neighbour hopping terms eliminates this discrepancy .",
    "we also note that the three ",
    "site hopping terms @xmath40 suppress @xmath41 at all * k * except at the vbm @xmath23 .",
    "although we can not produce a quantitative comparison of @xmath41 with arpes results , we will see ( in section [ comparison ] ) that this suppression of @xmath41 makes @xmath2 agree better with arpes results .    to make a comparison of @xmath29 with experimental results",
    ", we should express it in units of ev and relative to the experimental fermi energy .",
    "this can be done by using the energy scale @xmath45 ev and the location of the arpes peak at @xmath46 . in fig .",
    "[ dispersion ] we plot the dispersion relation of the @xmath47 with and without the three  site hopping terms , and our numerical results are compared with arpes data @xcite .",
    "consistent with previous studies @xcite , we find that adding the farther  than ",
    "neighbour hopping terms to the @xmath0 model leads to an ( essentially ) isotropic effective mass tensor near the vbm . however , there is still some dispersion along the @xmath13 to @xmath14 direction , in contrast to the featureless arpes results .",
    "previous studies @xcite have suggested that including the three ",
    "site hopping term @xmath40 can reduce the dispersion along this direction , hence making the theoretical prediction closer to the experimental result .",
    "however , from fig .",
    "[ dispersion](b ) we see that @xmath40 only lowers the energy of @xmath24 by a small amount ( and thus our exact , unbiased , numerical results are in disagreement with earlier analytical work , as well as with work on smaller clusters ) . despite the lack of perfect agreement along this direction ,",
    "this is the best comparison to the dispersion relation inferred from the arpes data for the @xmath47 hamiltonian that we have found .",
    "the principal quantity of interest in this paper is the electron spectral function @xmath2 , and is defined by @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the ground  state energy and wave function at half filling , respectively , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the energy and wave function of the @xmath54th eigenstate of the single - hole problem , respectively . to fit the lineshape of the arpes results we need to broaden the delta peaks from the theoretical calculation .",
    "the continued fraction expansion used in ref .",
    "is equivalent to broadening the peaks by lorentzians , @xmath55~~. \\label{lorentzian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the broadening factor @xmath56 is a constant , independent of * k * and @xmath22 . to determine @xmath56 we fit @xmath2 to the arpes at @xmath46 where the peak is most well defined . for the best agreement",
    ", we have to use @xmath57 mev . note",
    "that this is as large as the coherent bandwidth , which is @xmath58 mev .",
    "now , since all energy scales and @xmath56 are fixed by the spectrum at @xmath46 , no fitting is needed for other * k*.    in fig .",
    "[ constantfit ] we plot @xmath2 on top of the corrected arpes data at the available * k * from @xmath13 to @xmath30 .",
    "( these experimental data are probably the most reliable because in the experiment the angle between the electric field vector , the sample axes , and the ejected electrons remains constant . )",
    "since the theoretical model is supposed to describe only the low energy physics of the cuo@xmath20 plane , we truncate the spectrum at @xmath59 ev .",
    "it is obvious that the model can reproduce the experimental finding that the spectral weight is maximum at the vbm and that the peak broadens and weakens as * k * moves away from this point in the brillouin zone .",
    "further , we find that the incoherent part of the theoretical spectra make the peaks asymmetric , also in qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "however , they are not as asymmetric as the experimental results , and the comparison is not entirely encouraging .",
    "of course , the question is : is this the best this theoretical model can do ?",
    "looking at the vbm peak , which is the sharpest and the most prominent , it is clear that we can not completely fit the arpes result with simple lorentzians , since the high energy part of the peak falls off much faster than a lorentzian .",
    "contrary to the arpes of metals , this faster fall off can not be accounted for by including a fermi function . to improve the comparison of our numerics and experiment , without microscopic justification we use an energy ",
    "dependent broadening function @xmath60 .",
    "analogous to eq .",
    "( [ lorentzian ] ) , we write @xmath61~~ , \\label{edependent}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the normalization factor , @xmath63 from the spectrum at @xmath23 in fig .",
    "[ constantfit ] , the low energy tail ( incoherent part ) of the spectrum seems to need larger broadening . for simplicity",
    "we choose @xmath60 to be linear in @xmath22 : @xmath64 note that at the first peak ( @xmath65 ev ) , @xmath66 mev which is similar to the constant @xmath56 mentioned above .    in fig .",
    "[ bestfit ] we plot @xmath2 calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ edependent ] ) and ( [ edepepsilon ] ) on top of the corrected arpes data for those * k * from @xmath13 to @xmath30 .",
    "this shows that our energy ",
    "dependent broadening function is able to produce a much improved fit at all * k*. in figs .",
    "[ 00 - 10 ] and [ 01 - 10 ] we plot the comparison along the @xmath13 to @xmath14 , and the @xmath14 to @xmath15 directions , respectively",
    ". figures  [ bestfit ] , [ 00 - 10 ] , and [ 01 - 10 ] show that our model fits the arpes lineshape at many * k * very well .",
    "the least satisfactory fit is at @xmath67 , which is also the least satisfactory * k * point in the dispersion relation comparison , as seen in fig .",
    "[ dispersion ] . despite this",
    ", our model does produce the largest spectral weight ( _ c.f .",
    "_ table  [ zq ] ) along the @xmath13 to @xmath14 direction at this wave vector , similar to experiment .    in principle",
    ", we can allow the broadening function to be dependent on * k * , @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "for example , instead of determining the two coefficients in eq.([edepepsilon ] ) using the spectrum at @xmath23 , we can determine them at each * k*. we have completed such fittings , but we do not find much better results , and in particular , the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental spectra at @xmath24 remains .",
    "to summarize , to compare the theoretical and experimental lineshapes we have argued that the arpes data of @xmath1 is dominated by direct transitions , and thus with the valence band contribution appropriately subtracted off , one can obtain the spectral function for a single hole propagating in a cuo@xmath20 plane . from these experimental spectral functions",
    "it is obvious that the spectrum at each * k * can not be fit by a single , narrow peak ; instead , the incoherent part is important .",
    "we have studied the effects of including farther  than  nearest neighbour and three  site , spin ",
    "dependent hopping terms to the @xmath0 model .",
    "consistent with previous studies , we find that these terms increase the dispersion along the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone edge ( @xmath14 to @xmath15 ) , and suppress that along the @xmath14 to @xmath13 direction .",
    "in addition , these terms suppress the quasi  particle weight except at the valence band maximum @xmath23 .",
    "this is shown to be essential in fitting the theoretical lineshape to the experimental results .",
    "we also find that if we use an energy ",
    "dependent broadening function @xmath60 , we can obtain a reasonably good fit in an energy range of up to 1.8 ev below the fermi level . the fact that we find a damping linear in energy",
    "should not be seen as direct support for the marginal fermi liquid hypothesis , since we are studying an insulator and thus we can not predict that this linear term survives in the ( anomalous ) metallic state .",
    "the least satisfactory fit is found along the @xmath14 to @xmath13 direction , and at @xmath24 our calculated spectrum is significantly lower than the arpes result . to date , only three  band models have provided a reasonable agreement with the dispersion near this point .    an interesting question that follows from our results is : what is the origin of the incoherent processes that contribute so strongly to spectral functions of a single hole propagating in a strongly correlated , half  filled state ?",
    "two possibilities seem worthy of further study .",
