    "inspection of fig.[fig : s4 ] , also reveals an enhancement of @xmath117 and @xmath57 near optimal doping , which can be consistently explained by an enhancement of electron - lattice coupling @xmath41 .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath41 not only increases @xmath117 , but also could potentially affect the  background \" piezoresistivity effect measured by @xmath57 .",

    "finally , the parameter @xmath118 remains mostly constant across underdoped and optimal doped compositions but becomes negative for some overdoped compositions .",
    "this might be due to the fact that both @xmath32 and @xmath55 become small for overdoped compounds , which makes the fitting less constrained . on the other hand for the overdoped compounds there is no phase transition at finite temperature , and hence the sign of parameter @xmath38 is less crucial , and higher order coefficients can be introduced to bound the free energy .",

    "<S> evolution of the nematic susceptibility ( @xmath32 ) of 122  as a function of temperature and doping . </S>",
    "<S> structural , magnetic and superconducting transition temperatures (  ,  and ) are shown as squares , triangles and circles . the mean field electronic nematic critical temperature(@xmath58 ) obtained from the fit to the data in fig . [ fig : fig3 ] are shown as open red stars . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of nematic susceptibility and nematic critical temperatures clearly indicates an electronic nematic quantum phase transition occurs close to optimal doping.,width=321 ]    to quantitatively track the evolution of nematic fluctuations across the phase diagram , numerical fits to the data were performed for each composition based on eq.[eq : fit ] . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained @xmath58 is also plotted as a function of composition in fig.[fig : fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it can be clearly seen that the mean field nematic critical temperature @xmath58 closely tracks the actual structural transition temperature  in the underdoped regime , and is suppressed to zero at the optimal doping . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 becomes negative as the doping further increases beyond optimal doping , indicating a  paranematic \" state . </S>",
    "<S> significantly , our experimental data and analysis reveal an electronic nematic quantum phase transition for a composition close to optimal doping . </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be seen whether fluctuations associated with this quantum phase transition play an important role in enhancing @xmath61 in the superconducting phase . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the existence of nematic fluctuations across such a wide temperature and doping range suggests that they are a fundamental ingredient to describe the normal state of the system@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiment we introduced here is a methodology to detect the electronic tendency towards rotational symmetry breaking as if there is no coupling to the lattice , and is by no means restricted to the iron pnictides . </S>",
    "<S> one can also incorporate this methodology with other experimental probes , which allows us to more generally disentangle the cause and effect in systems for which different degrees of freedom strongly couple . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it is still an ongoing debate about the microscopic mechanism of the electron nematic phase transition in pnicitides , which could potentially arise from the spin@xcite or orbital@xcite degree of freedom . by applying a constant strain and measuring temperature dependence of the orbital response by arpes@xcite or optical conductivity@xcite and measuring the spin response by neutron scattering </S>",
    "<S> , the debate might be resolved . </S>",
