    "the standard model of elementary particles ( sm ) is perhaps the most successful model that has been experimentally tested .",
    "nevertheless , the so called solar and atmospheric neutrino problems jeopardized the effectiveness of the sm .",
    "it took around 30 years of intense debate and confrontation of theory and experiments to realize that the correct mechanism needed to understand the deficit between expected neutrinos and the measured events at terrestrial detectors is the neutrino oscillation mechanism @xcite : neutrinos change their flavor due to the fact that they are massive and their flavor states are a mixture of their mass states .",
    "this is the first evidence of physics beyond the sm and consequently it requests to extend the sm in the leptonic sector . in summary",
    ", sm needs to incorporate :    * neutrinos masses @xmath2 and , * mixing in leptonic sector , that is , an equivalent to the ckm matrix called @xmath3 , where the matrix @xmath4 is the mixing matrix between flavor states and mass states , i.e. @xmath5 .",
    "this will be refereed as the @xmath6-sm .",
    "the current values for the masses and mixing angles can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the objective of the present note , as part of the proceeding of the cinvestav s advanced summer school , is to illustrate how neutrino phenomenology , within the @xmath1sm , can constrain others possible extensions to the sm . as an example",
    ", we will focus on the recently proposed _",
    "scenario  @xcite , where a scale invariant sector could exist above tev energies that can couple with the sm sector in the low - energy limit . for the student s benefit , in this note we present a general overview of how constrain nonstandard properties with neutrino . for a more detailed discussion on the unparticle s parameter limits by using the latest reactor neutrino data",
    ", we suggest to read @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the biggest difficulty for detecting neutrino is at the same time the biggest advantage : the neutrino interacts only through weak interactions . within the @xmath1sm ,",
    "the neutrino does nt have electric charge , or magnetic moment and any other interaction will be automatically considered as nonstandard interaction .",
    "that makes them the perfect candidate for detecting physics that is not considered within the sm because most of the times , in the low energy limit , those extension will produce new charged or neutral currents , flavor neutral changing currents ( fcnc ) , or new neutrino properties .",
    "this situation can be easily translated into an algorithm for constraining the parameters of a possible sm s extension :    1 .",
    "star with @xmath6-sm : sm+neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "compute standard processes .",
    "[ uno ] 2 .",
    "propose a new theory : derive a new effective lagrangian at low energies , @xmath7 , that introduces new parameters besides those considered in the sm .",
    "[ dos ] 3 .   compute physical processes : either scattering or decay processes ( @xmath8,@xmath9).[tres ] 4 .   impose limits on the free parameters by comparing with experimental data through an statistical analysis ( usually using a @xmath10 analysis ) .",
    "[ cuatro ]    for instance , the step number [ tres ] can be directly be used to compute the expected number of neutrinos . neglecting for a moment the detector efficiency and resolution , it can be computed as @xmath11 with @xmath12 the data taking time period , @xmath13 the total neutrino flux , @xmath14 the total mass of the detector , @xmath15 the normalized neutrino spectrum , @xmath16 the maximum neutrino energy and @xmath17 the detector energy threshold .",
    "the contribution due to new physics is encapsulated in the total cross section @xmath18 which contains both , the sm and the new physics contribution obtained from @xmath19 including also the interference terms , if they are not absent . for the step number [ cuatro ] ,",
    "the comparison of the theoretical expected events and the experimentally observed can be done by computing and minimizing the @xmath10 function @xmath20 which automatically give us the allowed region for the free parameters @xmath21 at some confidence level .",
    "neutrino data can offer the possibility of studying unparticle phenomenology in two ways : first one by studying the effects of virtual unparticle exchanged between fermionic currents , second one by studying the direct production of unparticles .",
    "the neutrino - electron and neutrino - nuclei scattering are examples where unparticle effects of the first type are measurable , while single - photon production ( @xmath22 ) at lep is an example of direct production of unparticles .",
    "notice that , beside neutrinos ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 can be any new hypothetical particle , in particular , unparticle stuff . in this case",
    ", neutrino production is the background reaction , because the signatures for detection of unparticles are also the missing energy and momentum .      * _ step 1 _ : starting with the @xmath1sm , the relevant processes are the neutrino - electron scattering and the electron - positron annihilation to photon plus missing energy .",
    "the respective @xmath6-sm cross sections are shown in table [ tablasm ] .",
    "still not observed coherent neutrino - nuclei scattering , @xmath25 , is shown also as a future perspective .",
    "+ .cross section for the relevant sm processes . here",
    "@xmath26 is the fermi constant , @xmath27 are the sm coupling constants to electron , protons and neutrons respectively,@xmath28 the electron mass , @xmath29 the nucleon mass , @xmath30f_{nucl}^v(q^2)$ ] , @xmath31f_{nucl}^a(q^2)$ ] .",
    "@xmath32 is the nuclear form factor , @xmath33 the atomic number , and @xmath34 the number of neutron in the nuclei .",
    "@xmath35 in @xmath36 refers to the polarization . [",
    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      there is another interesting issue related with neutrinos .",
    "they are copiously produced in most of the astrophysical objects : the sun , neutrons star , supernova explosions , merger of neutron stars , agn etc , all those astrophysical phenomena involve neutrino production",
    ". a very small change in the neutrino properties or interactions will enhance or decrease the number of neutrinos produced due to the large amount of matter and high energies involved .",
    "this fact has been used successfully in order to constrain neutrino properties and/or new interactions .",
    "the unparticle case was not the exception and currently there are several limits obtained . in table",
    "[ tablavectorial ] we show some limits and we include the limits obtained from our analysis .",
    "despite some of the limits are orders of magnitude stronger than the ones obtained by terrestrial experiments , there are assumptions made and , in that respect , a direct measurement always offers a clean determination of free parameters . for a more extensive discussion of the assumptions made",
    "see @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "we have illustrated how neutrino data can offer a clean way for constraining free parameters of new extensions to the standard model of elementary particles .",
    "we used as a test the _ unparticle _ scenario and we see that present and future experiments in neutrino physics are competitive and complementary to other high energy and astrophysics observations .",
