    "most star formation in a molecular cloud occurs in dense sub - parsec sized clumps , which only constitute a fraction of the cloud s volume .",
    "detailed analysis of star formation physics thus requires sub - parsec resolution and accurate column density and mass measurements , which before 2012 was very challenging outside of the milky way .",
    "however , a much more extreme range of physical conditions is accessible outside the milky way than within it : more massive stellar clusters with more energetic feedback , metal abundances significantly different from solar , and different galaxy - scale dynamics .",
    "the most extreme extragalactic molecular cloud and star formation environments in the local universe are super - star clusters ( sscs ) .",
    "sscs form thousands of massive stars in a cubic parsec ; young sscs in the present - day universe offer a unique laboratory in which to study the impact that this extreme mode of star formation has on its environment , including subsequent star formation .",
    "sscs are also likely a dominant mode during the era of galaxy assembly z@xmath02 @xcite , so they are important to understand galaxy evolution .",

    "next , one must consider that @xmath2co becomes optically thick near the surface of a pdr ( within n(h@xmath7)@xmath010@xmath59 of the transition from c@xmath60 to c@xmath61 to co , typically at @xmath622 for the milky way gas to dust ratio ) , whereas @xmath4co remains at most moderately optically thick throughout a dense clump .",

    "higher resolution will likely break these clumps up into smaller substructures , but we can gain insight by comparing physical parameters derived from these data with clumps in other clouds decomposed at similar physical resolution .",
    "different decomposition algorithms have been explored , for example gaussclumps @xcite , in which gaussians are fit to the brightest peaks , subtracted , and the process iterated .",
    "such fitting allows the separation of blended structures , but assumes a functional form for the intensity ( gaussians ) . in extragalactic studies , methods which do not presuppose a functional form",

    "both methods select local maxima in the data cube and then assign pixels to those local maxima .",
    "the clumpfind program assigns all pixels with flux above some specified floor to the nearest local maximum , whereas cprops only assigns pixels within an isosurface which contains a single local maximum .",
    "in crowded regions with complex emission , clumpfind tends to produce a `` patchwork quilt '' assignment cube dividing up the low level emission , whereas cprops only assigns the peaks , leaving fairly bright emission unassigned .",
    "we use a hybrid approach in which local maxima are chosen using the cprops criteria , based on their contrast above shared emission , and signal - to - noise",
    ". then emission between local maxima is assigned , down to a flux level containing several local maxima , but not all the way down to the same noise floor across the entire region .",
    "all of the trends discussed below are calculated for a range of decomposition parameters , both with and without the apportionment of emission using the hybrid approach .",

    "the spatial moment must be converted to a radius , which depends in the intensity profile .",

    "i.e. the volume fraction of the cloud that is in dense clumps is somewhat less deeper into the cloud , perhaps due to a different spatial spectrum of turbulence or less fragmentation .",
    "the uncertainty in separation plotted here is the difference between the nearest neighbor distance , and 1/@xmath121 times the distance to the second nearest neighbor .",
    "there is also a weak trend for the size of the resolved clumps to increase with distance away from r136 , although there is no lack of unresolved clumps further back in the cloud as well .",
    "the lack of strong trends in clump properties is consistent with the overall conclusion that dense clumps in this molecular cloud are not significantly different from dense clumps in other environments , but that the larger - scale cloud physics may be affected . in this case , the cloud may be compressed overall closer to the pdr front , bringing the dense clumps closer together , but once dense clumps form , their properties do not apparently vary strongly with depth into the cloud .",
    "if this result holds generally , it would support a `` normal '' stellar initial mass function in super - star clusters : in 30  doradus the super - star cluster is already formed , and current star formation will not amount to another super - star cluster , but we do have evidence that lower - mass stars and small clusters form `` normally '' in dense clumps even in the vicinity of many massive stars .",

    "the data suggest a decrease in @xmath6 in brighter , more massive clumps .",
    "the measured x - factor is 2 times the average value in the milky way and other solar - metallicity galaxies , again merely the scaling expected for the lmc metallicity . since most of the @xmath2co emission is associated with dense clumps , the ratio of total cloud mass to @xmath2co emission may be higher when inter - clump h@xmath7 is included . 6 .",
    "the high end of the dense clump mass function has a power - law slope of -1.0@xmath710.2 , similar to sub - parsec sized clumps in galactic massive star formation regions",
    ".   clump physical properties are not a strong function of distance from the dominant source of radiation , the r136 cluster core . in particular , we measure no trend in the x - factor or clump mass with distance from r136 . there is a weak trend for the clumps to be larger and further from each other as one travels back into the molecular cloud away from r136 . in other words",
    "the fraction of the molecular cloud filled with dense clumps is larger closer to the pdr edge where radiative feedback is strongest .",
    "alma is beginning to dissect star formation regions and star - forming molecular gas on previously inaccessible size scales .",
    "for the first time we can study molecular cloud physics resolving structures smaller than 1pc outside the milky way . studying physics like this in a wide range of environments promises to revolutionize our understanding of star - forming molecular clouds .",

    "<S> some clumps are associated with protostars , including `` pillars of creation '' photoablated by intense radiation from r136 . </S>",
    "<S> emission from molecular clouds is often analyzed by decomposition into approximately beam - sized clumps . </S>",
    "<S> such clumps in 30  doradus follow similar trends in size , linewidth , and surface density to milky way clumps . </S>",
    "<S> the 30  doradus clumps have somewhat larger linewidths for a given size than predicted by larson s scaling relation , consistent with pressure confinement . </S>",
    "<S> they extend to higher surface density at a given size and linewidth compared to clouds studied at 10pc resolution . </S>",
    "<S> these trends are also true of clumps in galactic infrared - dark clouds ; higher resolution observations of both environments are required . </S>",
    "<S> consistency of clump masses calculated from dust continuum , co , and the virial theorem reveals that the co abundance in 30  doradus clumps is not significantly different from the lmc mean , but the dust abundance may be reduced by @xmath02 . </S>",
    "<S> there are no strong trends in clump properties with distance from r136 ; dense clumps are not strongly affected by the external radiation field , but there is a modest trend towards lower dense clump filling fraction deeper in the cloud . </S>"
