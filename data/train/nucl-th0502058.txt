    "thus phenomenological studies are necessary to connect the experimental heavy - ion collision data with the eos especially for nuclear matter at high baryon densities . in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , where nuclear matter in a wide range of temperatures and densities are probed ,",
    "many ideas on the eos and phases have been examined .",
    "for example , very dense matter is created in recent rhic experiments  @xcite suggesting the creation of the gas of deconfined quarks and gluons ( qgp ) . in 1970",
    "s and 1980 s , the existence of strong collective flow in heavy - ion collisions was suggested in hydrodynamics  @xcite , and it was examined in experiments at bevalac  @xcite . since collective sideward flows are generated in the early stages of collisions by the repulsive nucleon potential in nuclear matter , the observed strong collective flows were believed to signal very large pressure at high baryon densities , i.e. hard eos  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the real part of the nucleon - nucleus potential is already repulsive at the normal density at high incident energies , and the role of the momentum dependence of nuclear potential on the collective flows was extensively studied from around 1990  @xcite . in order to distinguish the momentum and density dependence",
    ", we need to invoke heavy - ion collision data in a wide incident energy range .",
    "we have now systematic collective flow data at various incident energies ; lbnl bevalac  @xcite , gsi schwerionen synchrotron ( sis )  @xcite , msu nscl  @xcite , bnl alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags )  @xcite , cern super proton synchrotron ( sps )  @xcite , and bnl rhic@xcite .",
    "collective flow data obtained at ags energies ( @xmath0 gev ) show a good landmark to determine eos . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the saturating momentum dependence of the mean - field ( mf ) , a large number of hadronic resonances , and string degrees of freedom are essential in order to explain all of the radial , sideward , and elliptic flows at ags energies .",
    "the momentum dependence of nuclear potentials in the context of collective flow was also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite with quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model .",
    "it is discussed that we can separate the momentum dependence by analyzing the so - called balance energy at which the flow disappears , and it was later on confirmed in experiment at nscl  @xcite for @xmath7 mev .",
    "recently , danielewicz et al . have also discussed the eos with these data within boltzmann equation simulation  @xcite , showing that reliable stiffness value ( @xmath8 mev ) can not be uniquely determined from currently available collective flow data ( @xmath9 or @xmath4 ) up to ags energies ( @xmath10 gev )  @xcite .",

    "transport models without mf effects ( arc , hsd , jam ) can describe bulk observables such as transverse mass spectra or rapidity distributions , but they can not explain anisotropic collective flows , which are sensitive to mf potentials .",
    "transport models with mf effects ( rqmd , bem , rbuu , art , urqmd ) have been successful in explaining anisotropic collective flows in addition to bulk observables up to ags energies . for sps energies ,",

    "sideward flow is mainly generated by the participant - spectator interaction .",

    "elliptic flow is most easily generated in the early stages of the collisions , since spatial anisotropy is the largest .",

    "on the other hand , @xmath4 in our model is generated in the late stage until the time reaches the order of nuclear radius , where densities are not very high , but it is not formed in the early stage in our model .",

    "[ ypxb11 ] that ignoring mf for non - nucleonic baryons ( specified as `` n '' in the figure ) at 2a gev reduces both the @xmath55 slope and the strength at the forward rapidities by about 20 % compared to the case of `` b '' in which all baryons feel mf .",
    "but slope remains the same at 11a gev among `` n '' and `` b '' . on the other hand , it is seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ ypxb11 ] that mf only for nucleons is not enough to suppress @xmath3 at sps energies .",
    "one can also see some differences of @xmath4 in `` b '' and `` n '' in fig .",
    "[ sv2b ] up to ags energies .",
    "the experimental data lie between `` b '' and `` n '' except for 40 @xmath14 gev , suggesting that mf for excited baryons are smaller than that of nucleons .",
    "next , we have checked the time step size @xmath97 dependence . since update of mf after each collision requires a huge calculation time , we evaluate mf only at each time slice . when a baryon collides in one time step , that baryon is propagated with mf until the collision time and we ignore the mf after the collision before it is formed . in the time step of baryon formation , displacements by the mf for @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    "are evaluated by using the mf at the next time slice .",
    "this treatment is valid up to the first order in @xmath97 when one baryon collides and/or is formed once in one time step . in the later stages",
    ", this prescription is expected to work well because of the low collision frequency . in the early stages ,",
    "many collisions make strings and resonances which do not feel mf , so our prescription may not be too bad . in the middle stages , however , it may be possible that elastic scatterings are frequent enough and baryons keep to feel mf after collisions in each time step .",
    "thus we need to analyze the collision frequency effects on constructing flows by reducing @xmath97 . in figs .",
    "[ ypxb11 ] and [ sv2b ] , we plot the results with different time step sizes @xmath97=0.05 , 0.1 and 0.5 fm/@xmath25 . for @xmath55 at ags energies ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ ypxb11 ] ) , all the results with different time step size agree well with each other , and we can not distinguish these lines .",
    "time step size dependence of the @xmath4 as shown in fig .",
    "[ sv2b ] still gives us the confirmation of the convergence of the numerical results . for @xmath3 at sps energies ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ ypxb11 ] ) , only very small differences can be seen between the results with @xmath102 fm/@xmath25 and @xmath103 fm/@xmath25 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath54 fm/@xmath25 which has been used as a default throughout this work is small enough to perform a reliable calculations .",
    "finally , we would like to address the problem of the uncertainties of the transport model itself .",
    "in addition to the ambiguities in introducing collision terms , the equations of motion depend on the model treatment . it is not trivial at all to construct equations of motion of relativistic particles during heavy - ion collisions based on the potential or the mf giving an appropriate eos .",
    "at relativistic energies , there are several ways proposed so far to introduce the potential effects .",
    "1 .   relativistic mean field ( rmf ) having lorentz scalar @xmath104 and vector @xmath105 terms ( rbuu  @xcite ) .",
    "the scalar and the vector time - component are evaluated in the local rest frame , and by the lorentz transformation we can get @xmath105 in the calculation frame . thus neglecting a nonlocality in time , this evaluation of the potential is practically covariant . in this approach , however , we need to introduce strong cut - off for the coupling of vector meson and baryons  @xcite , since the vector potential effects linearly increase as a function of incident energy .",
    "lorentz scalar re - interpretation of non - relativistic potentials ( buu  @xcite , bem  @xcite ) . in the buu model",
    "@xcite , the lorentz scalar mf @xmath104 is obtained from the non - relativistic mf @xmath26 in the local rest frame through the relation , @xmath106 where @xmath36 is the baryon density  @xcite .",
    "for the momentum independent mf in bem in refs .",
    "@xcite , the scalar potential is directly given so as to fit the eos , and the scalar density is used for @xmath36 .",
    "they do not have any vector terms increasing at high energies , and the potential effects become mild compared to the rmf treatment .",
    "for example , the derivative of the above single particle energy gives rise to the factor @xmath107 in front of the @xmath104 derivative , and suppresses the potential effects .",
    "combination of the lorentz scalar and non - relativistic type density dependent potentials ( bem  @xcite ) .",
    "this approach is adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the momentum dependent mf in refs .",
    "the single particle energy is given as @xmath108 the derivative of @xmath109 does not come with the suppression factor such as @xmath110 , and generates strong effects at high energies , where both of the density and density derivative become large .",
    "4 .   constraint hamiltonian dynamics ( rqmd  @xcite , rqmd / s  @xcite ) . in rqmd and rqmd",
    "/ s , particle velocity and force are not given by the derivatives of the single particle energy , but by the derivatives of the total hamiltonian , as shown in the appendix in the case of rqmd / s .",
    "thus the relation to other mf models described above is not straightforward .",
    "however , the potential @xmath111 in the on - mass - shell constraint ( [ eq : on - mass - shell ] ) is introduced as lorentz scalar , and we have suppression factor @xmath112 in the equations of motion , ( [ eq : eom - r ] ) and ( [ eq : eom - p ] ) .",
    "these observations suggest that the rqmd and rqmd / s would give results similar to those in lorentz scalar mf models , such as buu  @xcite .",
    "another difference from other mf models exists in the nuclear density profile .",
    "one nucleon is represented by one gaussian packet rather than many test particles , then the nuclear diffuseness becomes generally larger in qmd - type models .",
    "this may generate artificial surface effects at large impact parameters or in light - ion collisions .",
    "however , central and mid - central collisions of heavy - nuclei are expected to be well described , as in the case of various cascade models , in which one particle is used for one hadron .",
    "we are not very sure which is the best way to include the potential effects in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "further formal developments on transport models in relation to nuclear eos would be necessary , and at the same time , phenomenological studies of heavy - ion collisions are required to verify the validity of models and to elucidate the eos . from the latter point of view , systematic study in a wide range of incident energy is needed , since the above uncertainties are closely related to the lorentz transformation properties , whose effects would vary drastically as the incident energy varies . the incident energy range from ags to sps energies studied in this work may provide a good benchmark test for transport models and the eos .",
    "we have investigated collective flows in heavy - ion collisions from ags ( @xmath0 gev ) to sps ( @xmath1 gev ) energies by using a combined framework of hadron - string cascade ( jam )  @xcite and covariant constraint hamiltonian dynamics ( rqmd / s )  @xcite . in jam ,",
    "various particle production mechanisms are taken into account  production and decay of resonances and strings , jet production and its fragmentation .",
    "momentum dependence of the mf is fitted  @xcite to the real part of the schrdinger equivalent global optical potential of hama et al .",
    "@xcite in a lorentzian form eq.([usep ] ) .",
    "saturation properties are fitted by introducing the density dependent potential of skyrme - type in the power series of @xmath36 .",
    "calculated results of cascade , cascade with momentum dependent mf , and cascade with momentum independent mf are compared with the data of sideward @xmath74 , directed @xmath3 , and elliptic @xmath4 flows as a function of rapidity , transverse momentum and beam energy from ags to sps .",
    "generally , results with momentum dependent mf reasonably well explain the trend of the data for proton flows .",
    "we note that it is for the first time to explain anisotropic proton collective flow data of heavy - ion collisions from ags to sps in one framework consistently . without momentum dependence in mf",
    ", we can not reproduce the strong enhancement of the sideward flow at @xmath113 gev , strong squeezing seen in @xmath4 for @xmath114 gev , and the suppression of proton @xmath3 at @xmath115 and @xmath76 gev .",
    "our new model  hadron - string cascade with momentum dependent mf  provides an improved description for collective flows in mid - central collisions from ags to sps energies .",
    "the present analysis implies that the effects of the momentum dependent potential is large up to the sps energies .",
    "there are still many problems to pin down the equation of state of dense nuclear matter from heavy - ion data .",
    "first , we have made an assumption that mf is taken into account only for baryons and all the baryons feel the same mf .",
    "it is interesting to extend the present work to discuss the mf effects for mesons and different mf for hyperons and resonance hadrons , and look at the @xmath99 or kaon flow data .",
    "secondly , we can not make soft eos ( @xmath116 mev ) in the present form of mf which is consistent with the optical potential .",
    "when the momentum dependence is fitted to the optical potential by hama et al .",
    "@xcite in the lorentzian form , the eos necessarily becomes relatively stiff in combination with the skyrme - type density dependent form as shown in table  [ parsets ] .",
    "the small sensitivity on eos with momentum dependence appeared in this work may be suggesting that the probed eos range is not wide enough .",
    "finally , the model dependence of the mf treatment has to be cleared in order to obtain model independent eos information . for this purpose ,",
    "it is necessary to test various mf treatment in one framework . in the present model ,",
    "we need to modify the on - mass - shell constraint to include lorentz vector potentials or potentials of other types .",
    "it can be a breakthrough for a transport model - independent discussion of eos .",
    "we are grateful to professor tomoyuki maruyama and professor pawel danielewicz for useful discussions and comments .",
    "this work is supported in part by the ministry of education , science , sports and culture , grand - in - aid for scientific research ( c)(2 ) , no . 15540243 , 2003 .",
    "here we briefly summarize the rqmd / s formalism developed by maruyama et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite for completeness .",
    "the original rqmd formalism is initiated by sorge et al . in ref .",
    "rqmd(/s ) is based on the constrained hamiltonian dynamics  @xcite which is formulated in a manifestly covariant way .",
    "we use 4-vectors @xmath117 and @xmath118 for the description of the @xmath119 particle system .",
    "therefore , we need to have @xmath120 constrains @xmath121 as physical phase space is @xmath122 dimension .",
    "now our hamiltonian may be constructed from the constraints @xmath123 and lagrange multiplier @xmath124 from the dirac s constraint hamiltonian formalism @xmath125 the equations of motion are then @xmath126 where the poisson brackets are defined as @xmath127 and the sign `` @xmath128 '' means the weak equality initiated by dirac  @xcite .",
    "when we require that constraints @xmath123 should conserve in time , then they fulfill @xmath129 particle trajectories in @xmath122 phase space is uniquely determined by the equations of motion eqs .",
    "( [ dq1 ] ) and ( [ dp1 ] ) together with eqs .",
    "( [ ui ] ) and ( [ cij ] ) when @xmath120 constraints are given .",
    "we use the following @xmath120 constraints in rqmd / s @xmath130 first @xmath119 constraints are the on - mass - shell constraints @xmath131 remaining @xmath119 conditions constrain the time fixation of the particles . in original rqmd time fixation",
    "@xcite , @xmath132-matrix has to be solved numerically at each time step to deduce inverse matrices .",
    "moreover , if particle production or annihilation occurs , the time fixation is violated and a initial @xmath133 of produced particles satisfying the constraints and energy conservation has to be imposed .",
    "maruyama et al . introduced simplified time fixation in rqmd / s with global time parameter @xmath134 in ref .",
    "@xcite as @xmath135 where , @xmath136 is a 4-component vector corresponding to @xmath137 at the rest frame of the particle , and @xmath133 is space - time coordinate of the @xmath138-th particle . the constraints eq .",

    "furthermore , @xmath142 can be obtained analytically , if we replace @xmath145 in the potential @xmath111 with the kinetic energy @xmath146 .",
    "this is a great advantage in the point of view of cpu time .",
    "one obtains the rqmd / s hamiltonian @xmath147 where @xmath148 the equations of motion are then @xmath149 in actual calculations , we have replaced @xmath145 with the kinetic energy @xmath146 in the denominators of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eom - r ] ) and ( [ eq : eom - p ] ) after evaluating all the derivative terms for simplicity",
