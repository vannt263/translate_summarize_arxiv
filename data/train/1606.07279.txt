    "hyperspectral remote sensing allows to obtain a fine description of the materials observed by the sensor : with arrays of sensors focusing on 5 - 10 nm sections of the electromagnetic spectrum , hyperspectral images ( hsi ) return a complete description of the response of the surfaces , generally in the visible and infrared range .",
    "the use of such data , generally acquired by sensors onboard satellites or aircrafts , allows to monitor the processes occurring at the surface in a non - intrusive way , both at the local and global scale  @xcite .",
    "the reduced revisit time of satellites , in conjunction with the potential for quick deployment of aerial and unmanned systems , makes the usage of hyperspectral systems quite appealing . as a consequence",
    ", hyperspectral data is becoming more and more prominent for researchers and public bodies .",
    "even if the technology is at hand and images can be acquired by different platforms in a very efficient way , hsi alone are of little use for end - users and decision makers : in order to be usable , remote sensing pixel information must be processed and converted into maps representing a particular facet of the processes occurring at the surface . among the different products traditionally available , land cover maps issued from image classification are the most common ( and probably also the most used ) . in this paper",
    ", we refer to land cover / use classification as the process of attributing a land cover ( respectively land use ) class to every pixel in the image .",
    "these maps can then be used for urban planning  @xcite , agriculture surveys  @xcite or surveying of deforestation  @xcite .",
    "the quality of land cover maps is of prime importance .",
    "therefore , a wide panel of research works consider image classification algorithms and their impact on the final maps  @xcite . improving the quality of maps issued from hsi",
    "is not trivial , as hyperspectral systems are often high dimensional ( number of spectral bands acquired ) , spatially and spectrally correlated and affected by noise  @xcite . among these peculiarities of remote sensing",
    "data , spatial relations among pixels have received particular attention  @xcite : the land cover maps are generally smooth , in the sense that neighboring pixels tend to belong to the same type of land cover  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the spectral signatures of pixels of a same type of cover tend to become more and more variable , especially with the increase of spatial resolution .",
    "therefore , hsi classification systems have the delicate task of describing a smooth land cover using spectral information with a high within - class variability .",
    "solutions to this problem have been proposed in the community and mostly recur to spatial filtering that work at the level of the input vector  @xcite or to structured models that work by optimization of a context - aware energy function  @xcite .    in this paper , we start from the first family of methods , those based on the extraction of spatial filters prior to classification .",
    "methods proposed in remote sensing image classification tend to pre - compute a large quantity of spatial filters related to the user s preference and knowledge of the problem : texture  @xcite , gabor  @xcite , morphological  @xcite or bilateral filters  @xcite are among those used in recent literature and we will use them as buiding blocks for our system . with this static and overcomplete set of filters ( or _ filterbank _ ) , a classifier is generally trained .",
    "even if successful , these studies still rely on the definition @xmath0-priori of a filterbank .",
    "this filterbank depends on the knowledge of the analyst may or may not contain the filters leading to the best performances .",
    "a filterbank constructed @xmath0-priori is also often redundant : as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trad ] , the filter bank is generally applied to each band of the image , resulting into a @xmath1-dimensional filter bank , where @xmath2 is the number of filters and @xmath3 the number of bands . proceeding this way proved in the past to be unfeasible for high dimensional datasets , such as hyperspectral data , for which the traditional way to deal with",
    "the problem is to perform a principal components analysis ( pca ) and then extract the filters from the @xmath4 principal components related to maximal variance  @xcite . in that case",
    ", the final input space becomes @xmath5-dimensional .",
    "but independently to the reduction phase , this goes against the desirable property of a model to be compact , i.e. , to depend on as few input variables as possible .",
    "therefore , in most works cited above an additional feature selection step is run to select the most effective subset for classification .",
    "this additional step can be a recursive selection  @xcite or be based on kernel combination  @xcite , on the pruning of a neural network  @xcite or on discriminative feature extraction  @xcite .        proceeding this way",
    "is suboptimal in two senses : first , one forces to restrict the number and parameters of filters to be used to a subset , whose appropriateness only depends on the prior knowledge of the user .",
    "in other words , the features that are relevant to solve the classification problem might not be in the original filterbank .",
    "second , generating thousands of spatial filters and use them all together in a classifier , that also might operate with a feature selection strategy , increases the computational cost significantly , and might even deteriorate the classification accuracy because of the curse of dimensionality . note that , if the spatial filters considered bear continuous parameters ( e.g. gabor or angular features ) , there is theoretically an infinite number of feature candidates .",
    "this paper tackles these two problems simultaneously : instead of pre - computing a specific set of filters , we propose to interact with the current model and retrieve only new filters that will make it better .",
    "these candidate filters can be of any nature and with parameters unrestricted , thus allowing to explore the ( potentially infinite ) space of spatial filters .",
    "this leads to an integrated approach , where we incrementally build the set of filters from an empty subset and add only the filters improving class discrimination .",
    "two approaches explored similar concepts in the past : grafting  @xcite and group feature learning  @xcite , which incrementally select the most promising feature among a batch of features extracted from the universe of all possible features admitted .",
    "since this selection is based on a heuristic criterion ranking the features by their informativeness when added to the model , it may be seen as performing active learning  @xcite in the space of possible features ( in this case , the active learning oracle is replaced by the optimality condition , for which only the features improving the current classifier are selected ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "finally , we study in detail the hierarchical features that have been discovered by our method .",
    "first , we discuss the distribution of the depth of features in the active set in the ash - bands model . top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : depth ] shows the distribution of the weights of the features in both the inputs bank @xmath3 and in the active set @xmath6 at the end of the feature learning . regarding the final bank @xmath3 , which contains @xmath7 features in the indian pines 2010 and @xmath8 in the houston 2013a case , most of the features are of depth @xmath9 ( the original features ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "but if we consider the final active set @xmath6 , of size @xmath12 ( indian pines 2010 ) and @xmath13 ( houston 2013a ) , we see that the median depth is of @xmath11 in both cases : this means that no features of depth @xmath9 ( no original features ) are kept in the final active set . the only exception is provided by the lidar data in the houston 2013a dataset , which is kept in the final active set .",
    "these observations are confirmed by the distributions illustrated in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : depth ] : the distribution of depths in the final bank @xmath3 ( blue dashed line ) has 60 - 70% of features of depth @xmath9 , while the distribution of the features selected during the iterations ( green line with circle markers ) shows an average more towards a depth of @xmath11 . the features in the final active set @xmath6 ( red line ) show a distribution even more skewed towards higher depth levels , showing that features of low depth ( typically depths of @xmath10 ) are first added to @xmath6 and then replaced by features with higher depth issued from them .",
    "to confirm this hypothesis even further , we study some of the features in the final active set , illustrated in fig .  [ fig : deep ] : when considering features of higher depth , we can appreciate the strong nonlinearity induced by the hierarchical feature construction , as well as the fact that intermediary features ( the original band 105 or the features of depth 2 ) are discarded from the final model , meaning that they became uninformative during the process , but were used as basis to generate other features that were relevant .",
    "another interesting behavior is the bifurcation observed in these features : the entropy filter on band 105 was re - filtered in two different ways , and ended up providing two very complementary , but informative filters to solve the problem .",
    "cl|cl + & +   + & +   +   & &   & + @xmath14 & & @xmath14 +   & &   & +   +   & &   & + @xmath14 & & @xmath14 +   & &   & + @xmath14 & & @xmath14 +   & &   & +   +   & &   & + @xmath14 & & @xmath14 +   & &   & +",
    "in this paper , we proposed an active set algorithm to learn relevant features for spatio - spectral hyperspectral image classification .",
    "confronted to a set of filters randomly generated from the bands of the hyperspectral image , the algorithm selects only those that will improve the classifier if added in the current input space . to do so",
    ", we exploit the optimality conditions of the optimization problem with a regularization promoting group - sparsity .",
    "we also propose a hierarchical extension , where active features ( firstly bands and then also previously selected filters ) are used as inputs , thus allowing for the generation of more complex , nonlinear filters .",
    "analysis of four hyperspectral classification scenarios confirmed the efficiency ( we use a fast and linear classifier ) and effectiveness of the approach .",
    "the method is fully automatic , can include the user favorite types of spatial or frequency filters and can accommodate multiple co - registered data modalities .    in the future , we would like to extend the hierarchical algorithm to situations , where a datasets shift has occurred between the training and testing distribution : we observed that the proposed hierarchical algorithm yields lower performances on data with spectral distortion between training and test data , as in the houston 2013b dataset .",
    "moreover , connections to deep neural nets can be better formalized and lead to more principled way of exploring and choosing the features .",
