    "<S> a particularly complex , yet common situation is encountered when the photon s polarization state interacts with its own frequency modes , for instance in a birefringent crystal @xcite . in this case , correlations emerge between the polarization state , which encodes the qubit , and a continuum of frequency states . this type of quantum channel is frequently used in quantum information applications even though the environmental state describing the frequency modes is not fully controllable and hard to determine .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the @xmath0-dimensional subsystem , i.e. , the polarization qubit , can be fully controlled and detected with local operations even in such a complex system . </S>",

    "<S> with rm1 in place , the photons are directed to t2 , where the tomography of the reduced state @xmath43 is performed on the polarization subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> then the computer calculates the eigenstates @xmath44 and @xmath45 of @xmath43 , and controls hwp1 to rotate to the angle @xmath46 . at this point </S>",
    "<S> , we remove rm1 and place rm2 , causing the photons to go through the controlled dephasing map . </S>",
    "<S> the birefringence of the pm fiber is @xmath47 , so we have @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the pm fiber is long enough to completely remove coherences between the orthogonal subspaces spanned by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which are responsible for the quantum correlations in terms of the quantum discord . </S>",
    "<S> this way the state @xmath4 is prepared at the end of the pm fiber .     experimental results for the local trace distance @xmath51 , with @xmath42 for different @xmath52-values ( from ( a ) to ( h ) : @xmath53 with @xmath54 ) and an initial state prepared with @xmath55 and @xmath37 mm . </S>",
    "<S> the black lines show the theoretical prediction according to eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> ]    in the second step , we first remove all of the removable mirrors and send the photons with state @xmath1 to go through the unitary evolution of @xmath41 . considering only the polarization state , we obtain the evolved reduced state @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> . this state can be measured by the tomography setup in t1 . </S>",
    "<S> we then place rm2 and rm3 . </S>",
    "<S> now , instead of @xmath1 , we subject @xmath4 to the same evolution , and by local tomography we obtain another reduced state @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we can then calculate the trace distance @xmath58 between the two reduced states . here , we choose the parameters @xmath52 , @xmath11 as @xmath59 and @xmath60 , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath37 mm as an example , we obtain the results shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . the theoretical analysis yields the following expression for the local trace distance @xcite , @xmath63 since this expression is independent of @xmath52 , as clearly confirmed by the experimental data ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the red line shows the theoretical prediction given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , while the blue line represents the quantum correlations of the initial state according to eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 is the length of the calcite crystal , which can be considered as the different positions in a quantum channel . ]    in summary , we have prepared quantum correlated initial states in a photonic system composed of a single photon s polarization state and its frequency modes using a birefringent quantum channel . </S>",
    "<S> our all - optical experiment demonstrates that these quantum correlations can be detected and quantified by performing only local operations on the polarization subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical analysis shows that the local detection scheme leads to a close lower bound for the quantum correlations of the total initial state . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we emphasize that our work represents the first experimental realization of this scheme for mixed correlated initial states in an infinite - dimensional tensor product hilbert space , where a finite - dimensional truncation is prevented by the contributions of a truly infinite number of orthogonal continuous - variable states . </S>",
