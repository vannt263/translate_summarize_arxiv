    "although the qualitative features and the universal properties characterizing the transition are known since the development of the renormalization group ( rg ) approach @xcite , a quantitative theory able to predict phase boundaries for specific fluid models is not avaliable yet : most of the theories developed in liquid - state physics deal mainly with short - range correlations and short - wavelength density fluctuations .",
    "that is why they are not able to reproduce , even qualitatively , the phenomenology of the critical region .",
    "furthermore , these liquid - state theories give an unsatisfactory description of the thermodynamics along the first order liquid - vapor transition line .",
    "the convexity of the free energy is not guaranteed in the integral equation approach or in mean - field theories and in fact is always violated inside the two - phase region .",
    "this intrinsic deficiency is usually overcome by means of _ ad hoc _ procedures , like maxwell double tangent construction .",
    "an accurate description of the long - wavelength fluctuations is implemented within the liquid - state framework in the hierarchical reference theory of fluids ( hrt ) @xcite , where the basic rg concept of selective turning on of fluctuations is built into a genuine liquid - state theory .",
    "this feature made hrt the only practical scheme able to determine both universal and non - universal critical properties of fluids , so far .",
    "moreover , the proper treatment of long - wavelength fluctuations forces the free energy to display the correct convexity also in the two - phase region , thereby incorporating maxwell construction : a major achievement of hrt .",
    "although quite successful , the current sharp cut - off formulation of hrt predicts a diverging compressibility along the binodal ( in any dimension smaller than four ) @xcite while , for a scalar order parameter , a finite value of the inverse compressibility at coexistence is expected . in this paper",
    "we show that this failure of the hrt approach in the sharp cut - off formulation can be overcome by studying the _ smooth cut - off _ implementation , already introduced several years ago @xcite . in order to clarify the qualitative properties expected within this approach",
    ", we consider the simplest model displaying a phase transition within the ising universality class : the scalar @xmath0 field theory in three dimensions .",
    "a somehow related formalism has been recently put forward by caillol @xcite who developed a non - perturbative renormalization - group theory for fluids , within the grand canonical ensemble and applied it to the kac model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we review the sharp and the smooth cut - off formalism for a general microscopic fluid model . in section iii",
    "this formalism is applied to a @xmath0 field theory , where several simplifications occur .",
    "an approximate closure relation is introduced and discussed .",
    "the numerical solution of the equations at low temperatures and the comparison between the two approaches is presented in section iv , where the behavior at coexistence is analyzed .",
    "the critical properties of hrt in the smooth cut - off formulation are derived in section v , while section vi contains a short summary of the results and some perspective .",
    "the common principle underlying hrt , in its various formulations , is the selective treatment of density fluctuations on different length scales . starting from a mean field approximation",
    ", the effects of density fluctuations on short wavelengths are included first .",
    "this is accomplished by turning on the attractive part of the potential progressively , starting from its fourier components with larger wave vectors . a key role is therefore played by the cut - off wave vector @xmath1 which separates the fourier components already taken into account ( those with @xmath2 ) from those ignored ( @xmath3 ) . the full spectrum of fluctuations is then included only in the @xmath4 limit , while at @xmath5 the mean field approximation is recovered .",
    "the variation in the free energy induced by an infinitesimal change in @xmath1 can be computed exactly by use of perturbation theory , leading to a differential  evolution \" equation for the thermodynamics of the system .",
    "we study a system of particles in dimension @xmath6 , interacting via a two - body potential @xmath7 formally written as the sum of two contributions : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a short - range , repulsive reference part , and @xmath10 is a mostly attractive term defined by a regular function which can be fourier transformed .",
    "the properties of the system interacting via @xmath11 are assumed to be known by other liquid state theories or simulations . in order to implement the principle of hrt",
    ", the fourier components of @xmath10 have to be included gradually .",
    "therefore we define a sequence of @xmath1 systems characterized by an interaction @xmath12 : @xmath13 interpolating between the reference system ( obtained for @xmath14 ) and the fully interacting model ( for @xmath15 ) .",
    "the difference between sharp and smooth cut - off formulation resides in the way the cut off on the fourier components of the potential is implemented , as discussed in the following .      in the sharp cut - off formulation ,",
    "the precise definition of @xmath16 is conveniently given in fourier space : @xmath17 where the tilde denotes fourier transform . here , the cut - off @xmath1 varies between @xmath18 , where the potential reduces to the reference part , and @xmath19 , where the physical interaction ( [ 2bodyp ] ) is recovered . due to the long range oscillating tail in @xmath20 , induced by the sharp cut - off ,",
    "no phase transition occurs in each @xmath1-system until the @xmath21 limit is attained .",
    "it is now possible to write a differential equation for the evolution of the free energy @xmath22 of the @xmath1-system when the cut - off is varied .",
    "this equation , though exact , is not closed because it involves the two body correlation function of the @xmath1-system , and suitable approximations linking thermodynamics and correlations must be introduced . before discussing the adopted closure , following the rg approach , it is convenient to introduce an additional definition in order to take into account the fourier component of the potential with vanishing wave vector since the very beginning of the integration procedure .",
    "the @xmath23 term in fact gives rise to the mean - field contribution to the free energy which provides a physically correct starting point for the description of phase transitions .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a _ modified _ free energy density defined as : @xmath24+\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{\\rho^2}{2}\\left[\\tilde{\\phi}(k=0)-\\tilde{\\phi}_q(k=0)\\right ]   \\label{sharpen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the particle density .",
