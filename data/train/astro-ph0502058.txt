    "the presence of the large - scale bar in the central region of the galaxy was first suggested by @xcite and is now well established by a variety of methods : gas dynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , bulge surface brightness ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , luminous star counts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , bulge red clump stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , etc .",
    "a consensus is slowly emerging for a large - scale galactic bar with an axis ratio of 3:1:1 , a major axis oriented at 15 - 40@xmath12 with respect to the sun - galactic center line , with the nearer side at positive galactic longitudes , and a radius of more than 2.4 kpc @xcite .",
    "smaller non - axisymmetric structures have been suggested but no definite conclusion has been reached yet .",
    "@xcite made a star density map from 2mass data and suggested the existence of an inner bar ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) at an orientation different from the large - scale one .",
    "@xcite counted the number of stars in the narrow @xmath15 band at @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and found an asymmetry between positive and negative longitudes .",
    "however , dereddened luminosity functions of point sources at 7@xmath19 m showed symmetric distributions inside @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "secondary bars are common in external barred galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they may play a crucial role in gas inflows to galactic centers .",
    "detailed observations of the inner region of the galaxy to clarify the spatial distribution of stars are thus essential .    to investigate the inner structure of the galactic bulge",
    ", we use red clump ( rc ) stars .",
    "rc stars allow us accurate distance determinations because of their narrow luminosity distribution and large number in the bulge .",
    "rc stars were employed by the ogle group @xcite , and their observations in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands provided clear evidence of the large - scale bar @xcite . however",
    ", their observations were restricted to a few windows of low extinction at high latitude ( @xmath23 ) , where data might not constrain the bar structure reliably @xcite .    in this @xmath24 , we present the results of near - infrared survey at low galactic latitude ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "our results show clear evidence of an inner structure distinct from the large - scale bar .",
    "our observations were obtained in 2004 may - june using the near - infrared camera sirius ( simultaneous infrared imager for unbiased survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the irsf ( infrared survey facility ) 1.4 m telescope of nagoya university at south african astronomical observatory , south africa .",
    "sirius can provide @xmath26 m ) , @xmath27 m ) , and @xmath28 m ) images simultaneously , with a field of view of @xmath29 and a pixel scale of @xmath30 .    at @xmath25 ,",
    "we surveyed a strip extending over @xmath31 , with a latitude width of about 8(one field ) .",
    "the total area surveyed is thus about 2.8 square degrees ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : obsarea ] ) .",
    "our observations were obtained only on photometric nights and the typical seeing was 12 fwhm in the @xmath32 band .",
    "a single image comprises 10 dithered 5 sec exposures , and the whole strip required 168 images .    data reduction was carried out with the iraf ( imaging reduction and analysis facility ) software package .",
    "we applied standard procedures of near - infrared array image reduction in which dark frames were subtracted , flat - fields were divided , and sky frames were subtracted .",
    "photometry , including psf fitting , was carried out with the daophot package @xcite .",
    "we used the daofind task to identify point sources and the source lists were then input for psf - fitting photometry to the allstar task .",
    "the psf fit for each frame was constructed with about 20 isolated stars .",
    "each frame was calibrated with the standard star # 9172 in @xcite , which was observed every 30 min .",
    "we assumed that # 9172 is @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the irsf / sirius system .",
    "the average of the zero - point uncertainties was about 0.03 mag in both bands .",
    "the 10@xmath35 limiting magnitudes were @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "rc stars are the equivalent of horizontal branch stars for a metal - rich population .",
    "they constitute a compact and well - defined clump in a color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) and have a narrow luminosity distribution .",
    "the mean magnitude of rc stars is thus a good distance indicator , and we apply the method developed by ogle @xcite to our @xmath32 and @xmath38 data in this paper .    to analyze the distribution of rc stars , we define the extinction - free magnitude @xmath39 where we use the reddening law @xmath40 @xcite changes only a few tenths mag , and points in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang ] move up or down as a whole with the _ shape _ unchanged . ] and the intrinsic @xmath4 color of rc stars @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 is thus defined so that if @xmath43 is independent of location , then for any particular star @xmath42 is independent of extinction .",
    "first , we construct @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 cmds for individual regions of one degree in longitude . for this",
    ", we merge the data of 8 neighboring fields into one dataset , e.g. , we use the merged dataset of @xmath44 for @xmath45 , @xmath46 for @xmath47 , etc .",
    "second , we extract the stars in the region of the cmds dominated by rc stars ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ) and the extracted stars are used in turn to make @xmath42 histograms ( luminosity functions ; see fig . [",
    "fig : khk ] ) .",
    "the histograms have clear peaks and are fitted with the sum of an exponential and a gaussian functions ( see again , in fig .",
    "[ fig : khk ] ) .",
    "in addition to the rc peak , a much smaller but clear peak also exists in the @xmath48 histograms at a dereddened @xmath42 magnitude of @xmath49 ( e.g. , middle panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : khk ] ) .",
    "fitting was made up to the magnitude unaffected by this peak . at @xmath50 and @xmath51 ,",
    "the rc peaks appear distorted by this peak , so we excluded those datasets from our analysis .    owing to highly nonuniform interstellar extinction over the region surveyed , the peaks of rc stars in the cmds shift from one line of sight to another over the range @xmath52 .",
    "all the peaks are more than 1 mag brighter than the limiting magnitudes , so they are well defined . also we confirmed a completeness of 89% at @xmath53 by adding artificial stars into the most crowded frame ( @xmath54 ) .    the resulting dependence of the rc peak magnitude on the galactic longitude @xmath55 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang ] .",
    "error bars include uncertainties in the rc peak and the photometric calibration .",
    "assuming the absolute @xmath3 magnitude of rc stars to be @xmath56 mag @xcite , the absolute peak distances were also calculated and are shown using the scale on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : ang ] .",
    "the distance to the galactic center ( @xmath57 ) is @xmath58 kpc , slightly larger than the distance of @xmath59 kpc obtained as a weighted average of a variety of observations @xcite .    as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : ang ] , the rc peak becomes progressively brighter at a greater galactic longitude , from @xmath60 at @xmath6 to @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",
    "this is due to a nearer distance at @xmath63 than @xmath64 and clearly indicates that the bulge is not axisymmetric in support of previous work .",
    "however , the slope of the points in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang ] is not constant , becoming shallower at @xmath65 .",
    "the peak magnitude changes by only @xmath66 mag over the central @xmath67 , while it changes by more than 1 mag from @xmath6 to @xmath62 .",
    "this variation of the slope suggests the presence of an inner structure inside the large - scale bar .",
    "rc stars are good distance indicators @xcite , but their brightness weakly depends on their age and metallicity @xcite .",
    "the bulk of stars in the galactic bulge is very old @xcite , and for such stars the variation in rc brightness is estimated to be only 0.1 mag at @xmath68 for an age increase of 5 gyr @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite did not find any metallicity gradient along the galactic major axis at @xmath20 .",
    "although the gradient at larger @xmath55 along the galactic plane has not been well studied , no detectable gradient over the range @xmath69 was found by @xcite",
    ". therefore our results are not likely to be affected by age or metallicity variations of rc stars .",
    "@xcite observed bulge rc stars in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands , and estimated the modes of rc magnitudes .",
    "they found that the modes are @xmath70 mag brighter at @xmath71 and @xmath70 mag fainter at @xmath72 than at @xmath73 .",
    "their results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang ] so that the point at ( @xmath74 ) agrees with our data .",
    "the magnitude differences of the two datasets at @xmath75 are in good agreement , but the inner structure of the bulge escaped @xcite because their observations were only in discrete low extinction regions .    the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of point sources at @xmath76 m made by @xcite from @xmath77 to @xmath78 at @xmath79 are similar between positive and negative longitudes for @xmath80 .",
    "although their results imply that the inner region of the galaxy is axisymmetric , it would be very difficult to identify any difference between the lfs at the @xmath66 mag level , and the small asymmetry revealed by our observations might have been overlooked . at a greater longitude ,",
    "their lfs indicate that the stars at @xmath81 are generally closer to us than at @xmath82 .",
    "the large difference in apparent magnitude of rc stars at @xmath83 in our work agrees with their results .",
    "the narrow @xmath15 band observation of @xcite did find an asymmetry in the star counts at @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "although their statistics were not very good , they claim that the asymmetry is best fitted with the interpolation of the models developed by @xcite and @xcite for the large - scale bar",
    ". however we show here that the inner part makes a distinct structure , so the interpolation might not be appropriate .",
    "non - axisymmetric structures even smaller ( @xmath86 ) than discussed here have also been suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and larger ( @xmath87 ) ones have also been discussed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the scales of such structures are out of the range of our observation and they are thus undetectable by our survey .",
    "recent studies of other galaxies suggest that as many as one - third of all early - type barred galaxies have secondary bars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the presence of an inner structure inside a large - scale bar is not uncommon .",
    "since the rc peak magnitude within @xmath88 only slightly changes , the inner structure may well be a secondary bar whose major axis makes a larger angle with respect to the sun - galactic center line than the large - scale bar .",
    "however , even if the real distribution of stars in the inner part is axi - symmetric , the observed rc peak magnitude could show a dependence like that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang ] at @xmath89 . in this region",
    ", the stars of the inner structure and those of the large - scale bar will overlap along the line of sight , yielding the observed shallow slope .",
    "although further modeling is thus clearly required to determine the exact morphology of the inner structure , our near - infrared observations have demonstrated its existence towards the low galactic latitude of @xmath90 .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the distribution of stars in the galactic center region by using @xmath32 and @xmath3 data .",
    "the longitude - apparent magnitude relation of red clump ( rc ) stars in a thin strip along the galactic plane from @xmath91 to @xmath92 shows that the dereddened magnitude of the rc peak changes continuously from @xmath5 to @xmath7 .",
    "this variation , which agrees well with optical data by ogle , supports the presence of the large - scale bar found in previous studies .",
    "most importantly , an inner structure distinct from the large - scale bar is clearly found at @xmath9 , although its exact nature is still uncertain .",
    "we would like to thank yoshikazu nakada and martin bureau for their helpful comments .",
    "we also thank the staff at saao for their support during our observations .",
