    "there has been conclusive evidence indicating that our universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion .",
    "this acceleration is believed driven by a so called dark energy ( de ) in the framework of einstein s general relativity .",
    "the simplest explanation of such de is the cosmological constant .",
    "but it suffers serious problems such that its value is far below the prediction of any sensible quantum field theories and it inevitably sustains the coincidence problem with the mysterious same order energy density as the matter field today .",
    "there exists an alternative way to explain the acceleration of the universe expansion by modifying the einstein s gravity .",
    "one simplest attempt is called @xmath0 gravity , in which the scalar curvature in the lagrange density of einstein s gravity is replaced by an arbitrary function of @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "if the scalar field plays a role of de in the universe , de would interact with dm .",
    "the phenomenological de and dm interacting model has been studied extensively in literatures , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "more interestingly , it was found that a general @xmath0 gravity can be consistently constructed in a covariant form in terms of the mass dilation rate function in the einstein frame@xcite .",

    "the condition for the @xmath0 cosmology to avoid the instability at high - curvature region and be consistent with cmb observation require the energy flow from de to dm in the framework of the interacting model @xcite .",

    "we assume that the quantities defined in the jordan frame are consistent with the actual observational quantities .",
    "we will study the subhorizion approximation in the jordan frame .",
    "following  @xcite , from eqs.([jen_1],[jen_3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath184 where @xmath116 is governed by eq.([deltf ] ) @xmath185 and @xmath186 is defined by eq.([mdef ] ) . from eq.([secondme ] ) , the equation for the growth function @xmath187 in the sub - horizon approximation reads @xmath188 where @xmath189 and @xmath190     and the effective de equation of state @xmath3 in the jordan frame for the @xmath0 models we constructed . , width=307,height=268 ]",
    "the @xmath186 can be very large in the early time of the universe , since @xmath191 as @xmath192 . when @xmath193 , the regime is called ",
    "general relativistic(gr ) regime \" where the matter density perturbation has the standard evolution since the modified gravity does nt show up in this regime where @xmath194 and @xmath195 , @xmath196 .",
    "however , in the late time of the universe , when @xmath197 , the modified gravity effect has prominent influence on the structure formation because the ratio of @xmath198 , which has been altered greatly from the standard einstein model and in this case @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the value of @xmath18 today . this regime is called the  scalar - tensor(st ) regime \" and obviously matter perturbation does not have the standard evolution as in the einstein gravity in this regime . as shown in the upper panel of fig  [ evolution ] , in the transition phase of these two regimes , @xmath201 is strongly scale dependent on the wave number of @xmath202 .",
    "the transition of these two regimes can be characterized by @xmath203 which can occur as early as in the matter dominated epoch , even in small scales , in certain types of @xmath0 models in the expansion history of the universe  @xcite . in our model , since the dilation rate function @xmath58 will drop rapidly in the early time of the universe , the transition usually happens very late @xmath204 for interested wave number @xmath202 .",
    "thus in our constructed @xmath0 models , we have the standard matter dominated phase and matter power spectrum , which can avoid the problems for the usual @xmath0 model mentioned in @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have further disclosed the equivalence of the @xmath0 gravity presented in the jordan frame and in the einstein frame from the background dynamics to the perturbation theory . in the jordan frame",
    "we have derived the general analytic solution for the @xmath0 model to have the same expansion history as the @xmath1cdm cosmology .",
    "this analytic solution of the @xmath0 model can provide further insights on how cosmology can be used to test the gravity at the largest scales .",
    "moreover we have presented a systematic and self - consistent way to construct the @xmath0 model in the jordan frame through conformal transformation by using the mass dilation rate function in the einstein frame .",
    "we have also developed linear perturbation theories to further exhibit the equivalence of the @xmath0 gravity in the jordan frame and in the einstein frame .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath0 model constructed from the mass dilation rate can produce observational allowed effective de equation of state and provide the matter phase in consistent with cosmological observations .",
    "it is of great interest to confront our @xmath0 model with latest observations in the future study .",
    "it is interesting to note that our @xmath0 model was constructed from the mass dilation rate , which refers to a fundamental quantity , the mass , rather than the mysterious de equation of state .",
    "this gives the root for understanding the equivalence between the @xmath0 model in the jordan frame and the einstein frame , since we know well that the concept of mass plays a central role in gravitational theories  @xcite .",
    "the mass can be classified into the inertial mass and the gravitational mass . in the jordan frame",
    "the @xmath0 gravity can be effectively treated with the modified gravitational constant @xmath205 if we compare it with the einstein gravity .",
    "this is effectively equivalent to rescale the gravitational mass @xmath206 .",
    "however the inertial mass in the jordan frame is conserved so that the equation of motion for a free particle in the jordan frame is described by @xmath207 , which is the same as the description in the standard einstein gravity , where the rest inertial mass of particle is conserved .",
    "any change in the gravitational mass in the jordan frame inevitably changes the gravitational field , which , in turn , will change the inertial frame .",
    "any change in the inertial frame will induce the well - known  frame - dragging \" effect which was recently confirmed by the gravity probe b mission  @xcite .",
    "the inertial  frame - dragging \" effect can be equivalently considered as the  inertial mass - dragging \" effect by assuming that the inertial frame is unchanged while the inertial mass of particles defined in this frame is rescaled .",
    "this understanding can help us interpret that after the conformal transformation , in the einstein frame , the equation of motion for particles in the inertial frame is governed by the varying mass equation of motion @xmath208 which is one of the well established physics in general relativity  @xcite .",
    "the rest inertial mass in the einstein frame is indeed rescaled as @xmath209 and is no longer conserved .",
    "considering the mach principle , there should be no difference among gravitational theories described in different frames .",
    "thus a viable @xmath0 model in the jordan frame should be consistent with the viable model in the einstein frame in describing cosmology .",
