    "for years , few electron charged quantum dots have attracted extensive attention due to the controllable electronic and spin properties  @xcite .",
    "however , only few attempts have so far been made for studies of finite 1d nanowire quantum dots ( nwqds ) .",
    "more recently , it was shown that the nwqds formed in the heterostructures in nanowires can be fabricated as single electron transistors and successively charged with controlled number of electrons  @xcite .",
    "the successful experimental works motivate us to explore the possible geometric effects of nwqds characterized by their aspect ratios , @xmath0 , on the electronic and spin properties of two - electron charged nwqds .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the study of the singlet - triplet ( st ) transitions in two - electron charged nwqds  @xcite , conducted by using a developed configuration interaction ( ci ) theory in combination with the exact diagonalization techniques based on a 3d asymmetric parabolic model .",
    "it will be illustrated that the st transitions in inas - based nwqds driven by an appropriate magnetic field are associated with the competing effects of large spin - zeeman energies as well as the exchange and correlation energies .",
    "the correlation - dominated nature of a long nwqd ( i.e. with high aspect ratio ) will be identified by the spin phase diagram with respect to the applied magnetic fields and the tunable aspect ratio .",
    "we begin with the single electron problem of a nwqd with axial magnetic field @xmath2 , described by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the vector potential and @xmath5 stands for the effective mass of an electron with charge @xmath6 .",

    "the single electron hamiltonian ( [ h_sp ] ) leads to the extended fock - darwin single - particle spectrum @xmath15 where @xmath16 denote oscillator quantum numbers , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) the projection of electron spin @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) @xmath21 the spin zeeman energy , and @xmath22 is defined in terms of the hybridized frequency @xmath23 and the cyclotron frequency @xmath24 . .",

    "since only @xmath92 energy is decreased by spin - zeeman term , the st transition could only occur between @xmath95 and @xmath92 states .",
    "that is , only @xmath96 crosses zero as @xmath0 is very large , while @xmath97 remains positive always . thus below we shall only consider @xmath96 for the discussion of st transition .",
    "the non - interacting st splitting can be derived as @xmath98 , explicitly showing the quadratic decrease of @xmath99 with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "accordingly , in the non - interacting picture , the critical aspect ratio @xmath100 where the st transition occurs is predicted as @xmath101 .",
    "however , the pci calculation predicts a much smaller value of critical aspect ratio @xmath102 . in the pci result",
    ", the st splitting is substantially reduced by the energy reduction of the t state due to the reduced direct coulomb interaction and the negative exchange interaction between the two electrons in the state .",

    "in fact , the difference in the values of @xmath104 obtained from the pci and fci calculations increases as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this indicates that the coulomb correlation effect tends to increase the st splitting again and becomes even more pronounced in long nwqd with high @xmath0 .",

    "the spin singlet and triplet phases , appearing in the low @xmath0-@xmath1 and high @xmath0-@xmath1 regimes , respectively , are distinguished by the curve of @xmath105 which show a monotonic decrease with @xmath0 . for noninteracting electrons",
    ", the critical magnetic field can be derived as @xmath106 , showing a quadratic decay with @xmath0 .    in comparison with the non - interacting cases ,",
    "the pci calculations obtain the @xmath105 that is significantly reduced and goes to zero for @xmath107 . in the one - configuration approximation used in the pci calculation ,",
    "the st splitting is given by @xmath108 , where @xmath99 is the st splitting in the non - interacting cases , @xmath109 is the direct energy difference between the triplet and the singlet states , and @xmath110 is the exchange energy between electrons in the @xmath92 state .",
    "accordingly , we obtain @xmath111 . in the large aspect ratio regime , the negative @xmath112 and @xmath110 reduce the @xmath113 and @xmath114 results for @xmath115 . however , the fci calculation predict larger and always positive @xmath116 . in fact , as increasing @xmath0 , the relative strength of electronic coulomb correlations increases because of reduced @xmath117 and strong configuration interactions .",
    "such @xmath0-engineered coulomb correlations energetically favor the singlet two - electron states and result in the non - zero @xmath116 in the high aspect ratio regime .",
    "in conclusion , a configuration interaction ( ci ) theory is developed for studying the magneto - energy spectra and the singlet - triplet transitions of two - electron nwqds with longitudinal magnetic field @xmath1 and tunable aspect ratio @xmath0 . for short nwqds of low aspect ratio @xmath118 ,",
    "the st transition behaviors are dominated by the spin zeeman , coulomb direct and exchange energies , and can be well studied by using pci calculation . however , our fci calculations show the increasing importance of coulomb correlations in long nwqds with increasing aspect ratio @xmath0 over @xmath119 .",
