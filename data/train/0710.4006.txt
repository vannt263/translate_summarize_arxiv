    "particles in anharmonic potentials is a well studied example of chaotic system .",
    "a simple but good model of a system which exhibits parametric transitions from regular to chaos and vice - versa is the quartic oscillator .",
    "the parameters which control the transitions are the coupling strengths of the cross terms .",
    "the quartic oscillator besides being a case study of chaotic system , plays a very important role in the guise of higg s field , through which all the known fundamental particles acquire finite masses .",
    "the same potential also appears in optical lattices , where quantum phase transition from superfluid to mott insulator has been observed @xcite .",
    "optical lattices are regular intensity patterns of light created with counter propagating laser beams .",
    "the laser beams have a gaussian profile and create an overlapping anharmonic potential across the optical lattice .",
    "recent theoretical studies show that realization of the quantum phase transition can be more robust with a quartic potential @xcite . besides the quantum phase transitions , introducing a quartic confining potential stabilizes fast rotating vortices in bose - einstein condensates @xcite . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "the condensation temperature and thermodynamic properties of a rotating ideal bose gas in an anharmonic trap has been studied . however , in the experimental realization of the quadratic plus quartic confining potential , the observation of the fast rotating vortices eludes an unambiguous detection @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the critical temperature @xmath0 at which bosons confined by a quartic potential condense .",
    "bec in such a potential was studied for low - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "this calculation requires the density of states . in our calculations we use the semiclassical expression of the density of states , which is valid at higher energies .",
    "it is however not appropriate to study low lying states .",
    "in particular , the energy of the ground state is essential to estimate @xmath0 for finite number of particles . to estimate the correction to @xmath0 in the finite particle case",
    ", we calculate the ground state energy analytically @xcite .",
    "the calculation is based on a method which optimizes the matrix elements of the quartic potential hamiltonian in the harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "our calculations show that @xmath0 in quartic confining potential is higher than quadratic potential .",
    "this is perhaps to be expected , since @xmath0 varies as @xmath4 when the density of states is proportional to @xmath5 . in case of 3d harmonic oscillator potential @xmath6 whereas it is 9/4 in the case of 3d quartic potential .",
    "hence , in the quartic potential case @xmath0 varies as @xmath7 compared to @xmath8 in the case of harmonic potential . from our calculations ,",
    "it is evident that the cross terms increase @xmath0 in 2d as well as 3d quartic potential .",
    "we find that @xmath0 rises by factor of 1.2 and 1.1 in the 3d and 2d potentials respectively .",
    "however , the experimental realizations of the trapping potentials , which are created from laser beams , are more appropriately described without the cross terms .",
    "the general form of the quartic oscillator potential is @xmath9 .",
    "it is homogeneous and has cross terms in the cartesian coordinate representation which couple motions along different axes .",
    "potentials of this form occur in optical lattices , where counter propagating lasers create undulating patterns of standing radiation field . in one dimension",
    ", a pair of counter propagating gaussian laser beams along @xmath10-axis of intensity profile @xmath11 creates an array of periodic intensity minima and maxima .",
    "these are located along the @xmath10-axis .",
    "depending on the detuning of the laser , the atoms are attracted to the intensity minima or maxima .",
    "usually the wavelength of the laser @xmath12 is much smaller than the beam width @xmath13 . to a very good approximation , the potential across a surface normal to the laser beam @xmath14 tuning the parameters of the laser beams , it possible to retain only the quartic term . for simplicity , neglecting the cross terms , in three dimension @xmath15 the eigen energies of the corresponding hamiltonian is the sum of eigen values corresponding to each dimension .",
    "for the one dimensional quartic oscillator , eigen values can be calculated by minimizing the expectation of the hamiltonian in the basis states of harmonic oscillator of appropriately chosen frequency@xcite .",
    "generalizing the result to three dimensional case , the eigen energy @xmath16 since @xmath17 has the dimensions of energy we can represent this factor by @xmath18 , then @xmath19 we now determine the number of states @xmath20 with energy less than a given value @xmath21 . for energies large compared to @xmath18",
    ", we may treat @xmath22 s as continuous variables and neglect the ground state energy . to calculate @xmath20",
    ", we introduce a coordinate system in terms of the three variables @xmath23 . in this coordinate system @xmath24",
    "defines a surface of constant energy @xmath21 .",
    "then @xmath20 is proportional to the volume in the first octant bounded by the surface @xmath25 to evaluate the integral we use the relation @xmath26 , where @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "then the density of states @xmath28 this expression for density of states is used to calculate @xmath0 . for bosons ,",
    "the total number of particles occupying the excited states is @xmath29 at critical temperature @xmath30 in the case of bosons and @xmath31 is equal to the total number of bosons @xmath32 .",

    "the ratio is proportional to @xmath37 , which means that for @xmath38 atoms , @xmath0 in the case of 3d quartic potential trap is approximately six times higher than that of the 3d isotropic harmonic trap .",
    "the expression of @xmath0 in the previous section is with the approximation that the ground state energy is zero , which is a valid approximation when the system has large number of bosons . for finite number of bosons ,",
    "the zero point energy causes a change in the value of @xmath0 . for the 3d quartic potential ,",
    "the ground state energy is @xcite @xmath39 this should be equal to the change in the chemical potential at the critical temperature , that is @xmath40 . as the total number of bosons",
    "is fixed @xcite @xmath41 this implies @xmath42 using the expression of @xmath32 at temperatures slightly above @xmath0 @xmath43 this relation is obtained by substituting the general expression for the density of states i.e. @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.a.g ] ) . here",
    "@xmath45 is a constant whose value depends on the form of the trapping potential . then from eq .",
    "( [ eq.a.l ] ) and eq .",

    "the finite particle number is @xmath49 in the case of 3d quartic potential @xmath47 is equal to @xmath50 . then @xmath51 a relative measure of the effect of zero point energy on the critical temperature is the fractional change of the critical temperature .",
    "it is the ratio between @xmath52 and @xmath0 , for the present case @xmath53 noting that @xmath54 is equivalent to @xmath55 we get @xmath56 @xmath57 for the 3d isotropic harmonic potential , the fractional change of the critical temperature is @xmath58 if we compare eq .",
    "( [ eq.a.s ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq.c.a ] ) , we find that the percentage decrease in @xmath0 is larger in the case of 3d quartic potential trap for number of particles @xmath59 . but the scenario is reversed for number of particles @xmath60 .",
    "this is also evident from fig .",
    "( [ fig.2 ] ) where cross over point corresponds to the number of particles @xmath61 .",
    "consider the general form of the quartic potential , as mentioned earlier @xmath62 in optical traps , it is possible to create confining potentials which are approximately close to this form but a truly spherically symmetric one is not realizable .",
    "the difficulty is in producing the cross terms of the potential , for example , terms like @xmath63 in cartesian coordinate representation .",
    "the absence and presence of the cross terms in quadratic and quartic potentials respectively introduce a key difference between the dynamics in the two potentials . in absence of the cross terms like @xmath64 , in quadratic potential , a perturbation to the dynamics of a particle along an axis remains confined along that axis . in contrast , it propagates to other axes in the case of quartic potential . for condensates in traps ,",
    "an important parameter which reflects the effects of these terms is the critical temperature .",
    "semiclassically , total number of states available to the system can be obtained by dividing the total phase space volume by @xmath65 , the volume of a single state @xmath66 in the above equation @xmath67 and @xmath68 are radial coordinate and momentum corresponding to the classical turning point respectively . transforming the variable of integration from @xmath69 to @xmath21 ( using the relation @xmath70 ) we get @xmath71 thus the density of states is @xmath72 substituting @xmath73 we can transform the integral into a form which can be evaluated analytically @xcite @xmath74 using this expression for the density of states in eq .",

    "( [ eq.a.h ] ) we can obtain the ratio of @xmath0 in the two cases , with and without the cross terms , for the 3d isotropic quartic potential .",
    "it is found that @xmath0 with the cross terms is 1.2 times higher .",
    "this rise in @xmath0 can be attributed to the contribution from the cross terms which were neglected while deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq.a.h ] ) .",
    "the reason for the difference is , when @xmath76 then @xmath0 varies as @xmath77 .",
    "hence , the lower @xmath0 in 3d quartic potentials without the cross terms is due to the higher value of @xmath45 .      in the 2d case , neglecting the cross terms , the potential is of the form @xmath78 using the same approach as adopted in the 3d case , the total number of states available to the system is @xmath79 thus the density of states @xmath80 substituting this expression of @xmath81 in eq .",

    "( [ eq.b.g ] ) is approx .",
    "1.12 times higher than @xmath0 without the cross terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq.b.f ] ) .",
    "thus the cross terms increase @xmath0 in 2d as well as 3d case .",
    "our calculations show that @xmath0 in the case of the 3d quartic potential trap is higher than that of the isotropic harmonic potential trap .",
    "this is due to the form of the density of states @xmath81 , which varies as @xmath84 and @xmath85 in 3d isotropic quartic and quadratic trapping potentials respectively .",
    "this implies lower density of states in quartic oscillator potential compared to isotropic harmonic oscillator potential . however , more interesting is the effect of the cross terms . in the 3d isotropic",
    "harmonic potential trap the cross terms are absent , which is not the case for the 3d quartic potential trap .",
    "the cross terms tend to decrease the density of states and raise @xmath0 .",
    "these terms increase @xmath0 by factor of 1.2 and 1.1 in the 3d and 2d quartic trap potentials respectively as compared to the case without the cross terms .",
    "experimentally , in optical traps , the potentials without the cross terms are more appropriate .",
    "we find that the effect of finite particle number is more pronounced in the 3d quartic potential when the number of particles is @xmath86 .",
    "the situation is reversed when the number of particles is @xmath3 .",
    "the cause of the reversal lies in the form of the fractional change @xmath1 for the two potentials .",

    "it is @xmath88 for @xmath89 , @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
